    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Products from the Decomposition.**\n    The problem states that a 7.20 g mixture of salts A and B is heated and decomposes completely into a mixture of gases. These gases are then analyzed.\n\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2):** This is a powerful dehydrating agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.02 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.2 mol.\n\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂. The problem states its weight did not change. This is a crucial piece of information: no CO₂ was produced, which means the original salts A and B do not contain carbon.\n\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The mass increase of the tube, 0.80 g, is due to the mass of oxygen atoms that have bonded to the copper.\n        *   Atomic mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.00 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n        *   Since the gas was O₂, each molecule contains two oxygen atoms.\n        *   Moles of O₂ = Moles of O atoms / 2 = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n\n    *   **Remaining Gas (C):** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas C remains. The volume is given at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n        *   At STP, one mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas C and Check Mass Conservation.**\n    We can determine the identity of Gas C by using the law of conservation of mass. The initial mass of the salts must equal the total mass of the gaseous products.\n    *   Total initial mass = 7.20 g.\n    *   Mass of H₂O produced = 3.60 g.\n    *   Mass of O₂ produced = Moles of O₂ × Molar mass of O₂ = 0.025 mol × 32.00 g/mol = 0.80 g.\n    *   Mass of Gas C = Total initial mass - Mass of H₂O - Mass of O₂\n    *   Mass of Gas C = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Now we can find the molar mass of Gas C:\n    *   Molar Mass of C = Mass of C / Moles of C = 2.80 g / 0.1 mol = 28 g/mol.\n    *   A gas with a molar mass of 28 g/mol that is inert under these conditions is nitrogen (N₂). The presence of nitrogen is also suggested because we are dealing with the decomposition of salts. Therefore, Gas C is N₂.\n\n3.  **Determine the Elemental Composition and Identify the Salts.**\n    The decomposition products are 0.2 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.1 mol N₂. From this, we can find the total moles of each element in the original 7.20 g mixture.\n    *   **Moles of N:** from 0.1 mol N₂ → 0.1 × 2 = 0.2 mol N.\n    *   **Moles of H:** from 0.2 mol H₂O → 0.2 × 2 = 0.4 mol H.\n    *   **Moles of O:** from 0.2 mol H₂O and 0.025 mol O₂ → (0.2 × 1) + (0.025 × 2) = 0.2 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol O.\n\n    The empirical formula of the entire mixture is N₀.₂H₀.₄O₀.₂₅. To get integer ratios, we can multiply by 20, which gives N₄H₈O₅.\n\n    The problem states we have an *equimolar* mixture of two salts, A and B. This means the sum of the atoms in their chemical formulas must be N₄H₈O₅. We are looking for two common salts containing only N, H, and O that add up to this formula. Ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions are excellent candidates.\n\n    Let's test two likely salts:\n    *   **Ammonium Nitrate:** NH₄NO₃ (Formula: N₂H₄O₃)\n    *   **Ammonium Nitrite:** NH₄NO₂ (Formula: N₂H₄O₂)\n\n    Let's sum their formulas: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**.\n    This perfectly matches the elemental composition we derived from the products.\n\n4.  **Verify with Reaction Stoichiometry and Molar Masses.**\n    Let's check if the decomposition of an equimolar mixture of these two salts produces the observed molar ratios of products (H₂O : O₂ : N₂ = 0.2 : 0.025 : 0.1 = 8 : 1 : 4).\n    *   Decomposition of NH₄NO₂: NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n    *   Decomposition of NH₄NO₃ (at high temp): 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O\n\n    If we start with 'n' moles of each salt, the products are:\n    *   From `n` mol NH₄NO₂: `n` mol N₂ + `2n` mol H₂O\n    *   From `n` mol NH₄NO₃: `n` mol N₂ + `n/2` mol O₂ + `2n` mol H₂O\n    *   Total products: (n+n) mol N₂ + (n/2) mol O₂ + (2n+2n) mol H₂O = `2n` mol N₂ + `0.5n` mol O₂ + `4n` mol H₂O.\n    *   The molar ratio of products is H₂O : O₂ : N₂ = 4n : 0.5n : 2n = 8 : 1 : 4.\n    This matches the experimental ratio, confirming the identities of salts A and B.\n\n    We can also find 'n': from 0.025 mol of O₂, we have `n/2` = 0.025, so n = 0.05 mol.\n    The mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂.\n    *   Mass = (0.05 mol × 80.04 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 64.04 g/mol) = 4.002 g + 3.202 g = 7.204 g. This matches the initial mass.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms.**\n    The final step is to answer the question: \"Indicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.\" This means the sum of the atoms in the individual formula units.\n    *   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms.\n    *   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms.\n    *   **Total number of atoms = 9 + 8 = 17.**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
