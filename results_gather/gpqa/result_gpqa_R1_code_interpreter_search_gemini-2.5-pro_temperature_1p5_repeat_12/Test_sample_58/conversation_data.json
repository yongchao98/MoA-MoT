    "This problem requires calculating the pH of a solution made by mixing a weak acid (CH3COOH), a strong acid (HCl), and a strong base (Ba(OH)2). The final pH is determined by the species remaining after all neutralization reactions have occurred.\n\n**1. Calculate Initial Moles of Each Reactant**\n\nFirst, we determine the number of moles of the acidic and basic species being mixed.\n\n*   **Moles of CH3COOH (weak acid):**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles = 0.500 L * 0.1 mol/L = 0.050 moles CH3COOH\n\n*   **Moles of H+ from HCl (strong acid):**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.2 M\n    *   HCl is a strong acid, so it completely dissociates: HCl -> H+ + Cl-.\n    *   Moles of H+ = 0.400 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.080 moles H+\n\n*   **Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 (strong base):**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.3 M\n    *   Ba(OH)2 is a strong base that dissociates to yield two hydroxide ions: Ba(OH)2 -> Ba2+ + 2OH-.\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.300 L * 0.3 mol/L = 0.090 moles Ba(OH)2\n    *   Moles of OH- = 2 * 0.090 moles = 0.180 moles OH-\n\n**2. Perform Neutralization Reactions**\n\nNeutralization occurs in steps, with the strongest acid and strongest base reacting first.\n\n*   **Step 2a: Reaction between Strong Acid (HCl) and Strong Base (Ba(OH)2)**\n    The H+ ions from HCl react with the OH- ions from Ba(OH)2.\n    *   H+ + OH- -> H2O\n    *   Initial moles of H+ = 0.080 moles\n    *   Initial moles of OH- = 0.180 moles\n    *   H+ is the limiting reactant. All 0.080 moles of H+ will be neutralized.\n    *   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.180 moles - 0.080 moles = 0.100 moles\n\n*   **Step 2b: Reaction between Remaining Strong Base and Weak Acid (CH3COOH)**\n    The remaining 0.100 moles of OH- will react with the weak acid, CH3COOH.\n    *   CH3COOH + OH- -> CH3COO- + H2O\n    *   Initial moles of CH3COOH = 0.050 moles\n    *   Moles of OH- (from Step 2a) = 0.100 moles\n    *   CH3COOH is the limiting reactant. All 0.050 moles of CH3COOH will be neutralized.\n    *   Moles of OH- remaining (in excess) = 0.100 moles - 0.050 moles = 0.050 moles\n\n**3. Calculate the Final pH**\n\nThe final solution contains 0.050 moles of excess OH-, which makes the solution strongly basic. The presence of this strong base will dictate the pH. The contribution of the conjugate base (CH3COO-) formed is negligible in comparison.\n\n*   **Step 3a: Calculate the total volume of the solution.**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.200 L\n\n*   **Step 3b: Calculate the concentration of the excess OH-.**\n    *   [OH-] = Moles of excess OH- / Total Volume\n    *   [OH-] = 0.050 moles / 1.200 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Step 3c: Calculate the pOH.**\n    *   pOH = -log10([OH-])\n    *   pOH = -log10(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Step 3d: Calculate the pH.**\n    *   The relationship between pH and pOH at 25°C is: pH + pOH = 14.\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe pH of the final solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<C>>>"
