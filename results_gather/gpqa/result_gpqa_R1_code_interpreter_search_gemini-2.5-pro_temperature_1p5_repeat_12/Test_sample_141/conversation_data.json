    "An arbitrary density matrix $\\rho$ for a single qubit can be represented as a point $\\vec{r}=(r_x, r_y, r_z)$ within the Bloch sphere using the following relation:\n\n$\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}) = \\frac{1}{2}(I + r_x\\sigma_x + r_y\\sigma_y + r_z\\sigma_z)$\n\nwhere $I$ is the 2x2 identity matrix and $\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$ are the Pauli matrices:\n$I = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, $\\sigma_x = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, $\\sigma_y = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, $\\sigma_z = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe vector $\\vec{r}$ is called the Bloch vector, and its components determine the geometrical position of the state in the qubit space (the Bloch sphere). The components of the Bloch vector can be calculated from the density matrix using the formula:\n\n$r_i = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_i)$ for $i \\in \\{x, y, z\\}$.\n\nLet's first express the given density matrix in its matrix form. The basis states are:\n$\\left|0\\right\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\left|1\\right\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe projectors are:\n$\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right| = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right| = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe given density matrix is:\n$\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{2}I$\n\nThis is the maximally mixed state. Now, let's calculate the components of its Bloch vector $\\vec{r}$:\n\n1.  **Calculate $r_x$:**\n    $r_x = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_x) = \\text{Tr}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_x\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_x)$\n    $r_x = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}\\left(\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}(0+0) = 0$\n\n2.  **Calculate $r_y$:**\n    $r_y = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_y) = \\text{Tr}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_y\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_y)$\n    $r_y = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}\\left(\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}(0+0) = 0$\n\n3.  **Calculate $r_z$:**\n    $r_z = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_z) = \\text{Tr}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_z\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_z)$\n    $r_z = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}\\left(\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 + (-1)) = 0$\n\nThus, the Bloch vector is $\\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) = (0, 0, 0)$. This point corresponds to the center of the Bloch sphere.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) r=(1,1,0)\nB) r=(0,0,1)\nC) r=(1,1,1)\nD) r=(0,0,0)\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
