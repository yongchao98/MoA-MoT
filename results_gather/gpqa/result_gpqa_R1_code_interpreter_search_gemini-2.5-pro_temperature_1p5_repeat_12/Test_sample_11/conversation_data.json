    "This is a particle decay problem that can be solved using the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n**1. Define the System:**\n*   **Initial State:** A positive pion ($\\pi^+$) is at rest.\n*   **Final State:** A positive muon ($\\mu^+$) and a muon neutrino ($\\nu$) are produced.\n*   **Reaction:** $\\pi^+ \\rightarrow \\mu^+ + \\nu$\n\n**2. State Given Information:**\n*   Rest mass energy of pion, $m_{\\pi}c^2 = 139.6$ MeV.\n*   Rest mass energy of muon, $m_{\\mu}c^2 = 105.7$ MeV.\n*   The pion is stationary, so its initial momentum is zero.\n*   In this context, the rest mass of the neutrino ($m_{\\nu}$) is considered to be zero.\n\n**3. Apply Conservation of Momentum:**\nSince the initial pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. By the conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero.\n$p_{initial} = p_{final} = 0$\nThe two product particles must move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n$\\vec{p}_{\\mu} = -\\vec{p}_{\\nu}$\nLet the magnitude of the momentum of each particle be $p$.\n$|\\vec{p}_{\\mu}| = |\\vec{p}_{\\nu}| = p$\n\n**4. Apply Conservation of Energy:**\nThe total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n$E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n\n*   **Initial Energy:** The pion is at rest, so its total energy is its rest mass energy.\n    $E_{initial} = m_{\\pi}c^2$\n*   **Final Energy:** The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n    $E_{final} = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$\n    Using the relativistic energy-momentum relation $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2$:\n    *   $E_{\\mu} = \\sqrt{(p c)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n    *   $E_{\\nu} = \\sqrt{(p c)^2 + (m_{\\nu}c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(p c)^2 + 0} = pc$ (since $m_{\\nu} \\approx 0$)\n\nSetting $E_{initial} = E_{final}$:\n$m_{\\pi}c^2 = \\sqrt{(p c)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2} + pc$\n\n**5. Solve for the Momentum (p):**\nWe can now solve this equation for `pc`, which represents the energy-equivalent of the momentum.\n1.  Isolate the square root term:\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc = \\sqrt{(p c)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n2.  Square both sides:\n    $(m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n    $(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n3.  Simplify by canceling the $(pc)^2$ term:\n    $(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n4.  Solve for `pc`:\n    $pc = \\frac{(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}{2(m_{\\pi}c^2)}$\n\n**6. Calculate Kinetic Energies (KE):**\n*   **KE of Neutrino ($KE_{\\nu}$):**\n    $KE = E - mc^2$. For the neutrino, $E_{\\nu} = pc$ and $m_{\\nu}c^2 = 0$.\n    $KE_{\\nu} = pc$\n*   **KE of Muon ($KE_{\\mu}$):**\n    $KE_{\\mu} = E_{\\mu} - m_{\\mu}c^2$. From the energy conservation equation, we know $E_{\\mu} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - E_{\\nu} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc$.\n    $KE_{\\mu} = (m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc) - m_{\\mu}c^2$\n\nNow we can use Python to calculate these values.\n```python\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6  # MeV\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7  # MeV\n\n# Calculate pc using the derived formula\npc = (m_pi_c2**2 - m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# Calculate the kinetic energy of the neutrino\nke_nu = pc\n\n# Calculate the kinetic energy of the muon\nke_mu = m_pi_c2 - pc - m_mu_c2\n\n# Print the results, formatted to two decimal places\nprint(f\"KE of Muon: {ke_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"KE of Neutrino: {ke_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\nKE of Muon: 4.12 MeV\nKE of Neutrino: 29.78 MeV\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are 4.12 MeV for the muon ($\\mu^+$) and approximately 29.8 MeV for the neutrino ($\\nu$). Matching these values with the given options, we find that option C is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step solution:\n\n**1. Understand the Physics Principles**\n\nThis problem involves the decay of a particle at rest. The solution relies on two fundamental conservation laws of physics:\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n\nSince the speeds of the product particles can be a significant fraction of the speed of light, we must use relativistic formulas for energy and momentum.\n\n**2. Set Up the Decay Reaction**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A positive pion ($\\pi^+$) is at rest.\n    *   Initial Energy ($E_{i}$): Since the pion is at rest, its total energy is its rest mass energy, $E_i = m_{\\pi}c^2$.\n    *   Initial Momentum ($p_{i}$): Since it's at rest, its momentum is zero, $p_i = 0$.\n\n*   **Final State:** The pion decays into a positive muon ($\\mu^+$) and a muon neutrino ($\\nu$).\n    *   Final Energy ($E_{f}$): The sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino, $E_f = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$.\n    *   Final Momentum ($p_{f}$): The vector sum of the momenta of the two product particles, $p_f = \\vec{p}_{\\mu} + \\vec{p}_{\\nu}$.\n\n**3. Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n\nSince the initial momentum was zero, the total final momentum must also be zero.\n$p_i = p_f = 0$\n$\\vec{p}_{\\mu} + \\vec{p}_{\\nu} = 0$\nThis means the muon and the neutrino must fly off in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude. Let's call this magnitude 'p':\n$|\\vec{p}_{\\mu}| = |\\vec{p}_{\\nu}| = p$\n\n**4. Apply Conservation of Energy**\n\n$E_i = E_f$\n$m_{\\pi}c^2 = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$\n\nWe use the relativistic energy-momentum relation, $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0 c^2)^2$, where $m_0$ is the rest mass.\n*   For the muon: $E_{\\mu} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n*   For the neutrino: The neutrino's rest mass is considered to be zero ($m_{\\nu} \\approx 0$). So, $E_{\\nu} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + 0} = pc$.\n\nSubstituting these into the energy conservation equation:\n$m_{\\pi}c^2 = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2} + pc$\n\n**5. Solve for Momentum and Kinetic Energies**\n\nNow, we solve for `pc` (the momentum term), which will allow us to find the kinetic energies.\n\n*   First, we rearrange the equation:\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n\n*   Square both sides to remove the square root:\n    $(m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n    $(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n\n*   The $(pc)^2$ terms on both sides cancel out. We solve for `pc`:\n    $(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n    $pc = \\frac{(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}{2(m_{\\pi}c^2)}$\n\n*   **Calculate the Kinetic Energy (KE):** $KE = E_{total} - m_0c^2$.\n    *   **Neutrino's KE:** $KE_{\\nu} = E_{\\nu} - m_{\\nu}c^2 = pc - 0 = pc$.\n    *   **Muon's KE:** $KE_{\\mu} = E_{\\mu} - m_{\\mu}c^2$. From energy conservation, we know $E_{\\mu} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - E_{\\nu} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc$. Therefore, $KE_{\\mu} = (m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc) - m_{\\mu}c^2$.\n\n**6. Calculation**\n\nUsing the provided rest mass energies:\n*   $m_{\\pi}c^2 = 139.6$ MeV\n*   $m_{\\mu}c^2 = 105.7$ MeV\n\nThe python code from the thinking process performed these calculations:\n```python\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7\npc = (m_pi_c2**2 - m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\nke_nu = pc\nke_mu = m_pi_c2 - pc - m_mu_c2\n```\nThe results from the execution were:\n*   Kinetic Energy of Muon ($KE_{\\mu}$): **4.12 MeV**\n*   Kinetic Energy of Neutrino ($KE_{\\nu}$): **29.78 MeV** (which rounds to 29.8 MeV)\n\nThese values correspond to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
