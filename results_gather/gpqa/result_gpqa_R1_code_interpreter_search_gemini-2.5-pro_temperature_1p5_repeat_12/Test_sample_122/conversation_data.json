    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **Galaxy Reference Frame (S):** This is the stationary frame from which we are asked to measure the distance traveled.\n    *   **Ejecta Reference Frame (S'):** This is the moving frame. It moves at a velocity `v` relative to the Galaxy frame.\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time elapsed in the moving frame (the ejecta's own clock), `Δt' = 50 s`. This is the **proper time**, often denoted as `t₀`.\n\n3.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy reference frame (`Δx`).\n\n4.  **Apply the Principles of Special Relativity:**\n    *   The problem involves a high velocity (a significant fraction of the speed of light), so we must use the principles of special relativity, specifically **time dilation**.\n    *   **Time Dilation:** A clock moving relative to an observer is measured to tick slower than a clock that is at rest relative to the observer. The time interval measured in the stationary frame (S), `Δt`, is related to the proper time interval measured in the moving frame (S'), `t₀`, by the Lorentz factor, `γ` (gamma).\n    *   The formula for time dilation is: `Δt = γ * t₀`\n    *   The Lorentz factor `γ` is calculated as: `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`, where `c` is the speed of light.\n\n5.  **Step-by-Step Calculation:**\n\n    *   **Step 5.1: Define the speed of light (c).** We'll use the standard approximation `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n    *   **Step 5.2: Calculate the ratio v/c.**\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n    *   **Step 5.3: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n    *   **Step 5.4: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy reference frame (Δt).**\n        This is the time an observer in the Galaxy would measure for the 50 seconds to pass on the ejecta's clock.\n        `Δt = γ * t₀ = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n    *   **Step 5.5: Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy reference frame (Δx).**\n        The distance is simply the velocity of the ejecta multiplied by the time it traveled, as measured in the Galaxy's frame.\n        `Δx = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * ( (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s )`\n        `Δx = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n        `Δx = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\n6.  **Perform the final computation.** I will use Python to get an accurate numerical value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv = 60000  # velocity in km/s\nt0 = 50    # proper time in seconds\nc = 300000 # speed of light in km/s\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - (v**2 / c**2))\n\n# Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy reference frame\nt_galaxy = gamma * t0\n\n# Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy reference frame\nd_galaxy = v * t_galaxy\n\nprint(d_galaxy)\n```\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 3,061,862.18 km.\n\n7.  **Compare the result with the given options:**\n    *   A) 3,060,000 km\n    *   B) 2,940,000 km\n    *   C) 3,000,000 km (This would be the non-relativistic answer, `d = v * t₀`)\n    *   D) 2,880,000 km\n\n    The calculated value of `3,061,862.18 km` is extremely close to option A, `3,060,000 km`. The small difference (about 0.06%) is likely due to rounding in the problem's options.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem involves relativistic speeds, so we must use the principles of Special Relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\n**1. Understand the Frames of Reference**\n*   **Galaxy Frame (S):** This is considered the \"stationary\" frame of reference.\n*   **Ejecta Frame (S'):** This is the \"moving\" frame of reference. Its velocity relative to the Galaxy frame is `v`.\n\n**2. Identify the Given Information**\n*   Relative velocity, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   Time elapsed in the moving frame (the ejecta's own clock), `t₀ = 50 s`. This is the **proper time**.\n*   The speed of light, `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n**3. Determine the Goal**\nWe need to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured by an observer in the Galaxy frame (`d`). To do this, we first need to find out how much time has passed in the Galaxy frame (`Δt`).\n\n**4. Apply the Time Dilation Formula**\nAccording to the theory of special relativity, time for a moving object appears to pass slower when measured by a stationary observer. This phenomenon is called time dilation.\n\nThe relationship between the time measured in the moving frame (`t₀`) and the time measured in the stationary frame (`Δt`) is given by:\n\n`Δt = γ * t₀`\n\nwhere `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as:\n\n`γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n**5. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n*   **Step A: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n    *   First, find the ratio `v/c`:\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Now, calculate `γ`:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n        `γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206`\n\n*   **Step B: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame (Δt).**\n    *   Using the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * t₀ ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`\n    *   This means that while 50 seconds passed for the ejecta, an observer in the Galaxy would measure about 51.03 seconds passing.\n\n*   **Step C: Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy frame (d).**\n    *   The distance is the velocity of the ejecta (as measured in the Galaxy frame) multiplied by the time elapsed (as measured in the Galaxy frame).\n        `d = v * Δt`\n        `d ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,800 km`\n\nLet's do the exact calculation to be precise:\n`d = v * Δt = v * (γ * t₀) = 60,000 * (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50`\n`d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96)`\n`d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**6. Compare with the Options**\n*   A) 3,060,000 km\n*   B) 2,940,000 km\n*   C) 3,000,000 km\n*   D) 2,880,000 km\n\nOur calculated distance, `3,061,862 km`, is extremely close to option A. The minor difference is likely due to rounding in the question's options.\n\n<<<A>>>"
