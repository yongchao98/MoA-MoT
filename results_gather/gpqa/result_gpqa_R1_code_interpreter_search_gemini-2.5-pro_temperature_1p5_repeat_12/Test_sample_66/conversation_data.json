    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the initial state of the system.**\n    The system consists of two electrons, and its coupled angular momentum state is given by $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n    *   $l_1=1$ is the orbital angular momentum quantum number of the first electron (since it's in a 'p' orbital).\n    *   $l_2=1$ is the orbital angular momentum quantum number of the second electron (also in a 'p' orbital).\n    *   $l=2$ is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the two-electron system.\n    *   $m=-1$ is the quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum. This means the eigenvalue of the total angular momentum operator in the z-direction, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, is $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the state to be measured.**\n    We want to find the probability of measuring the z-component of the orbital angular momentum for each electron and getting specific values.\n    *   The desired measurement for the first electron is $L_{1z} \\rightarrow -\\hbar$. This corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_{l1} = -1$.\n    *   The desired measurement for the second electron is $L_{2z} \\rightarrow -\\hbar$. This corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_{l2} = -1$.\n    This measurement outcome corresponds to the system being found in the uncoupled state $|l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2}> = |1, -1; 1, -1>$.\n\n3.  **Relate the initial state and the measured state using the principles of quantum mechanics.**\n    The probability of finding the system in a particular state upon measurement is given by the square of the absolute value of the inner product (or projection) of the initial state onto the final state.\n    Let the initial state be $|\\Psi_{initial}> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n    Let the final measured state be $|\\Psi_{final}> = |1, -1; 1, -1>$.\n\n    The probability `P` is given by:\n    $P = |<\\Psi_{final} | \\Psi_{initial}>|^2 = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>|^2$.\n\n4.  **Use the conservation rule for the z-component of angular momentum.**\n    A fundamental concept in the addition of angular momenta is the relationship between the magnetic quantum numbers of the coupled and uncoupled states. A coupled state $|l, m>$ can be expressed as a linear combination (superposition) of uncoupled states $|m_{l1}, m_{l2}>$.\n    $|l, m> = \\sum_{m_{l1}, m_{l2}} C_{m_{l1}, m_{l2}} |m_{l1}, m_{l2}>$\n    where the coefficients $C_{m_{l1}, m_{l2}}$ are the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n\n    A crucial selection rule for these coefficients is that they are non-zero only if the z-components of the angular momentum add up:\n    $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$\n\n5.  **Apply the rule to the specific problem.**\n    In our case, the initial coupled state has $m = -1$.\n    The final uncoupled state has $m_{l1} = -1$ and $m_{l2} = -1$.\n    Let's check the sum for the final state: $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n    Since the `m` of the initial state (`-1`) is not equal to the sum `m_l1 + m_l2` of the final state (`-2`), the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient that connects these two states must be zero.\n    $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1> = 0$.\n\n    Another way to see this is that the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$ is an eigenstate of the total z-angular momentum operator $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$ with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$. The final state $|1, -1; 1, -1>$ is also an eigenstate of $L_z$, but with eigenvalue $(m_{l1} + m_{l2})\\hbar = (-1 - 1)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$. Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal. Therefore, their inner product is zero.\n\n6.  **Calculate the final probability.**\n    The probability `P` is the square of the inner product:\n    $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\n    Thus, the joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$ is zero.\n\n<<<A>>>"
