    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Reaction and the Question**\n\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) of monosubstituted benzene rings.\nThe question asks to arrange the substances in order of *increasing* yield of the *para*-isomer. The yield is given as a weight fraction, which is equivalent to the mole fraction (or percentage) since all monobromo-isomers (ortho, meta, para) of a given starting material have the same molar mass.\nThe key is to understand how the existing substituent on the benzene ring influences the position of the incoming bromine atom.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents**\n\nWe need to classify each substituent as either an *ortho, para*-director or a *meta*-director. This is the primary factor determining the amount of para-product.\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directors**: These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They generally lead to a significant yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   **-CH3 (in Toluene, 1)**: Activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **-C2H5 (in Ethylbenzene, 5)**: Activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **-Cl (in Chlorobenzene, 3)**: Deactivating, but *ortho, para*-director (a special case).\n\n*   **Meta-directors**: These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They produce very little para-isomer.\n    *   **-NO2 (in Nitrobenzene, 4)**: Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n    *   **-COOH (in Benzoic acid, 6)**: Deactivating, *meta*-director.\n    *   **-COOC2H5 (in Ethyl benzoate, 2)**: Deactivating, *meta*-director.\n\nFrom this classification, we know that the substances with *meta*-directing groups (4, 6, 2) will have the lowest para-isomer yields, while those with *ortho, para*-directing groups (1, 5, 3) will have the highest yields.\n\n**Step 3: Rank the Meta-Directing Substances (4, 6, 2)**\n\nFor *meta*-directors, the amount of para-product is very small. The order depends on the strength of the deactivating and meta-directing effect. The stronger the effect, the lower the yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The deactivating strength of these groups follows the order: **-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5**.\n    *   **-NO2 (4)** is one of the strongest deactivating groups. It directs almost exclusively to the meta position, resulting in a negligible (<1%) yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   **-COOH (6)** is also a strong deactivator.\n    *   **-COOC2H5 (2)** is similar to -COOH but is slightly less deactivating because the ethyl group (+I effect) slightly reduces the electron-withdrawing nature of the carbonyl group.\n*   Therefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be in the reverse order of their deactivating strength.\n*   Lowest para-yield: Nitrobenzene (4).\n*   Next lowest: Benzoic acid (6).\n*   Slightly higher: Ethyl benzoate (2).\n*   The order of increasing para-yield for this group is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 4: Rank the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (1, 5, 3)**\n\nFor *ortho, para*-directors, we need to compare the ratio of para to ortho substitution. This is influenced by both electronic and steric factors.\n\n*   **-CH3 (1) vs. -C2H5 (5)**: Both are activating alkyl groups. The main difference affecting the ortho/para ratio is steric hindrance. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased bulk hinders the attack at the two ortho positions more significantly, thus favoring attack at the single para position. This leads to a higher percentage of the para-isomer for ethylbenzene.\n    *   Para yield (Bromination): Toluene (~33%) < Ethylbenzene (~38%).\n    *   Therefore, the order is: **1 < 5**.\n\n*   **-Cl (3) vs. Alkyl groups (1, 5)**: Halogens are a special case. The chlorine atom is deactivating due to its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I), but its lone pairs allow for resonance donation (+M), which directs ortho and para. The strong inductive effect deactivates the ortho position (which is closer) more than the para position. This electronic factor strongly favors para-substitution.\n    *   For the bromination of chlorobenzene, the para-isomer is the major product, with a yield of approximately 87%.\n    *   This is much higher than the para-yield for toluene (1) or ethylbenzene (5).\n*   The order of increasing para-yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Rankings**\n\nNow, we combine the two groups. The meta-directors all have much lower para-yields than the ortho, para-directors.\n\n*   Group 1 (meta-directors): **4 < 6 < 2** (yields are ~<1%, ~1-2%, ~2-3%)\n*   Group 2 (ortho,para-directors): **1 < 5 < 3** (yields are ~33%, ~38%, ~87%)\n\nCombining them gives the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield:\n\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
