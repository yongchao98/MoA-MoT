    "Here is a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Normalize the initial state |α⟩**\n\nThe given state is `|α⟩ ∝ (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩`.\nIn vector notation, this is proportional to the column vector `[[1+i], [2-i]]`.\n\nTo normalize the state, we need to find the normalization constant C such that `⟨α|α⟩ = 1`.\nLet `|α⟩ = C * [(1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩]`.\nThe inner product `⟨α|α⟩` is calculated as:\n`⟨α|α⟩ = |C|^2 * [ (1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i) ]`\n`|C|^2 * [ (1 - i^2) + (4 - i^2) ] = 1`\n`|C|^2 * [ (1 + 1) + (4 + 1) ] = 1`\n`|C|^2 * [ 2 + 5 ] = 1`\n`|C|^2 * 7 = 1`\n`|C| = 1/√7`\n\nWe can choose C to be real and positive, so `C = 1/√7`.\nThe normalized state is:\n`|α⟩ = (1/√7) * [(1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩]`\nIn vector notation: `|α⟩ = (1/√7) * [[1+i], [2-i]]`\n\n**2. Define the Operator A and find its Eigenstates and Eigenvalues**\n\nThe operator A has matrix elements `Aij = ħ/2` for `i ≠ j` and `0` otherwise. In the `{|up⟩, |down⟩}` basis, this corresponds to the matrix:\n`A = [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]] = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\nThis is `(ħ/2)` times the Pauli-X matrix, `σx`.\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (λ), we solve the characteristic equation `det(A - λI) = 0`:\n`det([[ -λ, ħ/2 ], [ ħ/2, -λ ]]) = λ^2 - (ħ/2)^2 = 0`\nThis gives two eigenvalues:\n`λ1 = +ħ/2`\n`λ2 = -ħ/2`\n\nNow, we find the corresponding normalized eigenvectors (eigenstates):\n*   For `λ1 = +ħ/2`:\n    `[[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]] * [[a], [b]] = (ħ/2) * [[a], [b]]`\n    This leads to `(ħ/2)b = (ħ/2)a` and `(ħ/2)a = (ħ/2)b`, which simplifies to `a = b`.\n    The normalized eigenvector is `|v1⟩ = (1/√2) * (|up⟩ + |down⟩) = (1/√2) * [[1], [1]]`.\n\n*   For `λ2 = -ħ/2`:\n    `[[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]] * [[a], [b]] = (-ħ/2) * [[a], [b]]`\n    This leads to `(ħ/2)b = (-ħ/2)a`, which simplifies to `b = -a`.\n    The normalized eigenvector is `|v2⟩ = (1/√2) * (|up⟩ - |down⟩) = (1/√2) * [[1], [-1]]`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Probabilities**\n\nThe probability of measuring the particle in an eigenstate `|vi⟩` is given by `P(vi) = |⟨vi|α⟩|^2`.\n\n*   Probability for eigenstate `|v1⟩` (with eigenvalue `λ1 = +ħ/2`):\n    `⟨v1|α⟩ = [(1/√2) * (⟨up| + ⟨down|)] * [(1/√7) * ((1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩)]`\n    `⟨v1|α⟩ = (1/√14) * [ (1+i) + (2-i) ] = 3/√14`\n    `P(v1) = |3/√14|^2 = 9/14 ≈ 0.643`\n\n*   Probability for eigenstate `|v2⟩` (with eigenvalue `λ2 = -ħ/2`):\n    `⟨v2|α⟩ = [(1/√2) * (⟨up| - ⟨down|)] * [(1/√7) * ((1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩)]`\n    `⟨v2|α⟩ = (1/√14) * [ (1+i) - (2-i) ] = (1/√14) * (-1 + 2i)`\n    `P(v2) = |(-1 + 2i)/√14|^2 = ((-1)^2 + 2^2)/14 = (1+4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.357`\n\nThe probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.\n\n**4. Calculate the Average Value**\n\nThe average (or expectation) value `⟨A⟩` is given by `⟨A⟩ = ⟨α|A|α⟩`.\nWe can also calculate it using the eigenvalues and probabilities: `⟨A⟩ = Σ λi * P(vi)`.\n\n`⟨A⟩ = (λ1 * P(v1)) + (λ2 * P(v2))`\n`⟨A⟩ = (ħ/2) * (9/14) + (-ħ/2) * (5/14)`\n`⟨A⟩ = (ħ/2) * (9/14 - 5/14)`\n`⟨A⟩ = (ħ/2) * (4/14)`\n`⟨A⟩ = (ħ/2) * (2/7)`\n`⟨A⟩ = ħ/7`\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of A are `9/14 ≈ 0.64` and `5/14 ≈ 0.36`.\nThe average value of the operator A is `ħ/7`.\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
