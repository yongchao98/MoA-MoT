    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Potential:** The given potential is in polar coordinates (r, θ):\n    V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr²cos²(θ)\n\n2.  **Convert to Cartesian Coordinates:** The key to solving this problem is to see if the potential simplifies in Cartesian coordinates (x, y). The standard conversion formulas are:\n    *   x = r cos(θ)\n    *   y = r sin(θ)\n    *   r² = x² + y²\n\n    From these, we can see that `x² = r²cos²(θ)`. Now, substitute these into the potential expression:\n    V(x, y) = (1/2)k(x² + y²) + (3/2)kx²\n\n3.  **Simplify the Potential in Cartesian Coordinates:** Combine the terms with x²:\n    V(x, y) = (1/2)kx² + (3/2)kx² + (1/2)ky²\n    V(x, y) = (4/2)kx² + (1/2)ky²\n    V(x, y) = 2kx² + (1/2)ky²\n\n4.  **Identify the System:** The simplified potential V(x, y) is the sum of two independent potentials, one depending only on x and the other only on y:\n    V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)\n    where V_x(x) = 2kx² and V_y(y) = (1/2)ky².\n    This is the potential of a 2D anisotropic quantum harmonic oscillator.\n\n5.  **Solve the Schrödinger Equation:** For a separable potential, the time-independent Schrödinger equation can be separated, and the total energy E is the sum of the energies of the independent 1D oscillators:\n    E = E_x + E_y\n\n6.  **Find the Energy of Each 1D Oscillator:** The energy levels of a 1D quantum harmonic oscillator with a potential V(q) = (1/2)k_q q² are given by:\n    E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω, where the angular frequency is ω = sqrt(k_q / m).\n\n    We need to find the effective spring constants (k_x, k_y) and angular frequencies (ω_x, ω_y) for our system.\n    *   For the x-direction: V_x(x) = 2kx² = (1/2)k_x x². This implies k_x = 4k.\n        The angular frequency is ω_x = sqrt(k_x / m) = sqrt(4k / m) = 2*sqrt(k / m).\n        The energy for the x-motion is E_{n_x} = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * 2*sqrt(k / m).\n\n    *   For the y-direction: V_y(y) = (1/2)ky² = (1/2)k_y y². This implies k_y = k.\n        The angular frequency is ω_y = sqrt(k_y / m) = sqrt(k / m).\n        The energy for the y-motion is E_{n_y} = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k / m).\n\n    Here, n_x and n_y are non-negative integer quantum numbers (0, 1, 2, ...).\n\n7.  **Calculate the Total Energy Spectrum:** Sum the energies E_x and E_y to get the total energy E:\n    E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}\n    E = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * 2*sqrt(k / m) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n\n    Now, factor out the common term ħ*sqrt(k / m):\n    E = [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] * ħ*sqrt(k / m)\n    E = [2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2] * ħ*sqrt(k / m)\n    E = [2n_x + n_y + 3/2] * ħ*sqrt(k / m)\n\n8.  **Compare with the Options:** The calculated energy spectrum is:\n    E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ħ*sqrt(k/m)\n\n    This expression matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
