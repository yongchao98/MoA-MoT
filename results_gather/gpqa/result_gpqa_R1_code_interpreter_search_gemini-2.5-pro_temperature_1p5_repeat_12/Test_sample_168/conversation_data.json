    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Initial Decay Process:**\n    The original decay is given by the reaction:\n    `2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V`\n    Here, two heavy particles A decay into two heavy particles B, two light particles E, and two light particles V.\n    The problem states that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous. This is expected because the decay products include more than two particles (in this case, 6 particles). In such \"multi-body\" decays, the energy released (the Q-value) is shared among the products, leading to a continuous energy distribution for any subset of the products.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Variant Decay Process:**\n    The variant decay replaces the two V particles with a single exotic particle M:\n    `2A -> 2B + 2E + M`\n    The final state here consists of 5 particles. Since this is also a multi-body decay (more than two particles), the principle of energy sharing still applies. Therefore, the total energy spectrum of the two E particles will remain **continuous**. The shape of the spectrum will be different from the original decay because the phase space of the final state has changed (3 light particles to share energy instead of 4).\n\n3.  **Eliminate Incorrect Options:**\n    Based on the conclusion that the spectrum remains continuous, we can immediately eliminate options A and D, which state that the spectrum becomes discrete.\n    *   A) The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases. (Incorrect)\n    *   D) The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases. (Incorrect)\n\n4.  **Compare the Endpoints of the Spectra:**\n    The endpoint of the energy spectrum is the maximum possible kinetic energy the E particles can have, which corresponds to the total energy released in the reaction, known as the Q-value. The Q-value is determined by the difference in the total rest mass of the initial and final particles, according to Einstein's mass-energy equivalence, E=mc².\n\n    `Q = (Total initial rest mass - Total final rest mass) * c²`\n\n    *   **Q-value for the original decay (Q1):**\n        `Q1 = (m_2A - (m_2B + m_2E + m_2V)) * c²`\n        Assuming the masses are additive:\n        `Q1 = (2*m_A - (2*m_B + 2*m_E + 2*m_V)) * c²`\n\n    *   **Q-value for the variant decay (Q2):**\n        `Q2 = (m_2A - (m_2B + m_2E + m_M)) * c²`\n        Assuming the masses are additive:\n        `Q2 = (2*m_A - (2*m_B + 2*m_E + m_M)) * c²`\n\n5.  **Use Particle Properties to Compare Q-values:**\n    The problem provides crucial information about the particles:\n    *   The exotic particle M is **massless**, so `m_M = 0`.\n    *   The particle V is described as a \"lighter particle\" but not explicitly stated to be massless. In physics, particles like neutrinos (which V is analogous to) have a very small but non-zero rest mass. The explicit contrast in the description (\"massless\" M vs. \"lighter\" V) implies we should assume `m_V > 0`.\n\n    Now, let's substitute `m_M = 0` into the equation for Q2:\n    `Q2 = (2*m_A - 2*m_B - 2*m_E) * c²`\n\n    Compare this to Q1:\n    `Q1 = (2*m_A - 2*m_B - 2*m_E - 2*m_V) * c²`\n\n    We can see that `Q2` is equal to `Q1 + 2*m_V*c²`.\n    Since we assume `m_V > 0`, it follows that `2*m_V*c²` is a positive quantity.\n    Therefore, `Q2 > Q1`.\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The endpoint of the energy spectrum for the variant decay (Q2) is greater than the endpoint for the original decay (Q1).\n    Combining our findings:\n    *   The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape.\n    *   The endpoint increases.\n\n    This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
