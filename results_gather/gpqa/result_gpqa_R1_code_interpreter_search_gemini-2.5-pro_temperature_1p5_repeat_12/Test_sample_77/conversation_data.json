    "The problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) of a moving point charge q. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n1.  **Fundamental Concepts**: According to classical electromagnetism, electromagnetic fields propagate at the speed of light, `c`. Therefore, the field measured at a position `r` at time `t` is not determined by the state of the source charge at time `t`, but by its state at an earlier time, `tr`, called the **retarded time**.\n\n2.  **Retarded Time (tr)**: The retarded time is the time at which the electromagnetic signal must have been emitted from the charge's position `s(tr)` to reach the observation point `r` at the later time `t`. The time difference `t - tr` is the time it takes for light to travel the distance `|r - s(tr)|`.\n    *   Let `d = r - s(tr)` be the vector from the charge's position at the retarded time to the observation point.\n    *   Let `d = |d|` be the magnitude of this vector.\n    *   The retarded time `tr` is defined by the relation: `t - tr = d / c`.\n\n3.  **Liénard-Wiechert Potentials**: The potentials for a moving point charge are derived from Jefimenko's equations or by evaluating the retarded potential integrals for a point charge density `ρ(r',t') = qδ³(r' - s(t'))` and current density `J(r',t') = qv(t')δ³(r' - s(t'))`. The evaluation is non-trivial because the argument of the delta function contains the integration variable within the retarded time definition. The result of this calculation gives the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n4.  **Formulas**: The standard form of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:\n    *   Scalar Potential: `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (d - (d · v) / c)]`\n    *   Vector Potential: `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q v / (d - (d · v) / c)]`\n\n    Here, all quantities in the expressions (the distance `d`, its vector `d`, and the charge's velocity `v`) must be evaluated at the retarded time `tr`. The problem's notation already incorporates this.\n\n5.  **Simplifying the Expression**: The denominator can be rewritten to match the format of the options provided:\n    `d - (d · v) / c = (cd - d · v) / c`\n\n    Substituting this back into the potential formulas:\n    *   For the scalar potential `V`:\n        `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * q / ((cd - d · v) / c) = (qc) / (4πε₀ (cd - d · v))`\n\n    *   For the vector potential `A`:\n        `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * qv / ((cd - d · v) / c) = (μ₀ qc v) / (4π (cd - d · v))`\n\n6.  **Comparing with Options**:\n    *   **A) V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d·v)), A(r,t) = μ₀ qc v / (4π (dc - d·v))**: This exactly matches our derived expressions.\n    *   **B) V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc + d·v)), A(r,t) = μ qc v / (4π (dc + d·v))**: The sign in the denominator is incorrect.\n    *   **C) V(r,t) = q / (4πε₀ r), A(r,t) = (v²/c²) V(r,t)**: The scalar potential is the static Coulomb potential, which is wrong. The relation between A and V is also incorrect.\n    *   **D) V(r,t) = q / (4πε₀ r), A(r,t) = (v/c²) V(r,t)**: The scalar potential is incorrect. While the relation `A = (v/c²)V` is correct for Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the given expression for `V` is wrong.\n\nTherefore, option A correctly states the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<A>>>"
