    "*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2):**\n    *   First, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE), also known as the index of hydrogen deficiency.\n    *   DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A DBE of 4 usually indicates the presence of a benzene ring. The remaining degree of unsaturation (5 - 4 = 1) suggests a double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O), which is consistent with the two oxygen atoms in the formula.\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is a classic signature of a primary amine (-NH2) group, corresponding to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches, respectively.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The frequency is too high for a simple amide (which is typically < 1700 cm⁻¹) but fits well for an ester, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Integration:** The total number of protons is 3H + 2H + 2H + 2H + 2H = 11H, which matches the molecular formula.\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents a methyl group (-CH3) that is adjacent to a group with 2 protons (since the multiplicity is a triplet, n+1=3, so n=2).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal represents a methylene group (-CH2-) that is adjacent to a group with 3 protons (since the multiplicity is a quartet, n+1=4, so n=3). The combination of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm strongly indicates the presence of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The high chemical shift (downfield) of the quartet at 4.5 ppm suggests the -CH2- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom, as in an ester (-O-CH2-).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH2). The protons on nitrogen often exhibit broad signals due to quadropolar relaxation and chemical exchange. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two signals in the aromatic region (7-8 ppm), both appearing as doublets and each integrating to two protons, are characteristic of a *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The doublet at a higher chemical shift (8.0 ppm) is likely ortho (adjacent) to a strong electron-withdrawing group (like the ester carbonyl), while the doublet at a lower chemical shift (7.0 ppm) is ortho to an electron-donating group (the amine).\n\n*   **Putting It All Together:**\n    *   We have a *para*-substituted benzene ring.\n    *   One substituent is a primary amine (-NH2).\n    *   The other substituent is an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3). The C=O is directly attached to the ring, and the ethyl group is attached to the ester oxygen.\n    *   The resulting structure is 4-aminobenzoic acid, ethyl ester, also known as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the data. It has a para-substituted ring, a primary amine, and an ethyl ester group arranged in the correct way to explain the NMR shifts.\n    *   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a *meta*-substituted ring (would give a more complex aromatic pattern), and it's an amide, which is inconsistent with the IR C=O stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹.\n    *   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer. Here the ester linkage is different (-O-CO-CH2CH3). The -CH2- of the ethyl group would be adjacent to the C=O, not the ester oxygen, and would appear much further upfield (around 2.5 ppm), not at 4.5 ppm.\n    *   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide (-NH-), not a primary amine, which contradicts the IR spectrum showing two N-H bands.\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly points to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
