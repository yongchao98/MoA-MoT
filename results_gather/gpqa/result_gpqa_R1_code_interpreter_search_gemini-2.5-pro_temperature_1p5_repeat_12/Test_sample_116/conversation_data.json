    "*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n    Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is considered chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable on the original molecule. The most common features that lead to chirality are the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups) or axial chirality (as seen in certain atropisomers). A molecule is achiral (and thus optically inactive) if it possesses an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n*   **Step 1: Analyze dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    1.  **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl. The two phenyl rings are linked by a single C-C bond. The positions ortho to this bond (positions 2, 6, 2', and 6') are all substituted with bulky groups: two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH3) and two nitro groups (-NO2).\n    2.  **Chirality Check:** The presence of these large groups at the ortho positions causes significant steric hindrance, which prevents free rotation about the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restricted rotation is a condition for a specific type of stereoisomerism known as atropisomerism.\n    3.  **Symmetry Check:** Because the rotation is locked, the two phenyl rings are held in a twisted, non-planar conformation. This molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. The molecule and its mirror image are non-superimposable.\n    4.  **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral due to axial chirality (atropisomerism) and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    1.  **Structure:** The chemical formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. This is an ester, commonly known as methyl lactate.\n    2.  **Chirality Check:** We need to examine the carbon atoms for chiral centers. Let's look at the carbon at position 2 (the one attached to the hydroxyl group).\n    3.  **Groups Attached to C2:** This carbon atom is bonded to four different groups:\n        *   a hydrogen atom (-H)\n        *   a hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        *   a methyl group (-CH3)\n        *   a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    4.  **Conclusion:** Since the carbon at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center. The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral and thus it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze benzophenone**\n    1.  **Structure:** The structure is C6H5-C(=O)-C6H5. It is a ketone with two phenyl groups attached to the carbonyl carbon.\n    2.  **Chirality Check:** There are no chiral centers in the molecule. The central carbon is sp2-hybridized, bonded to only three groups.\n    3.  **Symmetry Check:** Although the two phenyl rings are twisted out of the plane of the carbonyl group, the molecule as a whole possesses a C2 axis of rotation that passes through the C=O bond. More importantly, it is possible to find a plane of symmetry. A plane passing through the C=O group and bisecting the angle between the two phenyl groups acts as a plane of symmetry.\n    4.  **Conclusion:** The presence of a plane of symmetry makes benzophenone an achiral molecule. Therefore, it is optically inactive.\n\n*   **Step 4: Analyze dimethyl fumarate**\n    1.  **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. Its structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    2.  **Chirality Check:** This molecule is planar. All the atoms lie in the same plane.\n    3.  **Symmetry Check:** Any planar molecule has the plane of the molecule itself as a plane of symmetry. Additionally, dimethyl fumarate has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C bond.\n    4.  **Conclusion:** Due to the presence of a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion, dimethyl fumarate is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n*   **Final Summary:**\n    *   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism.\n    *   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism.\n    *   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism.\n    *   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, only compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
