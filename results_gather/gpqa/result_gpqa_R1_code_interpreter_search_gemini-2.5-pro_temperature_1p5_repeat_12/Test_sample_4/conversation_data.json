    "This problem requires us to find the eigenvector of a spin-1/2 particle's spin operator along a specific direction. The eigenvector corresponds to the \"spin up\" state along that direction.\n\n1.  **Identify the Operators:**\n    The problem provides the components of the operator $\\vec{P}$. Let's write them down using the standard Pauli matrices notation. The spin operator $\\vec{S}$ for a spin-1/2 particle is given by $\\vec{S} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\vec{\\sigma}$, where $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$ are the Pauli matrices.\n\n    *   $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\sigma_x$\n    *   $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\sigma_y$\n    *   $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\sigma_z$\n\n    So, the operator $\\vec{P}$ is indeed the spin operator $\\vec{S}$.\n\n2.  **Define the Direction Vector:**\n    The direction $\\vec{n}$ is an arbitrary direction lying in the x-z plane. A unit vector in the x-z plane can be parameterized by a single angle, $\\theta$, which is the angle it makes with the positive z-axis.\n    $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$\n\n3.  **Construct the Operator in the Direction $\\vec{n}$:**\n    The operator for spin along the direction $\\vec{n}$, denoted as $P_n$ or $S_n$, is the dot product of the spin operator vector $\\vec{P}$ and the direction vector $\\vec{n}$.\n    $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n} = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n    $P_n = (\\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\sigma_x)(\\sin\\theta) + (\\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\sigma_y)(0) + (\\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\sigma_z)(\\cos\\theta)$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} (\\sigma_x \\sin\\theta + \\sigma_z \\cos\\theta)$\n\n    Now, substitute the matrices:\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\right)$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n4.  **Set up the Eigenvalue Equation:**\n    We are looking for the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ that corresponds to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$. The eigenvalue equation is $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$.\n    $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    We can cancel $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ from both sides:\n    $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    This gives a system of two linear equations:\n    1) $a\\cos\\theta + b\\sin\\theta = a$\n    2) $a\\sin\\theta - b\\cos\\theta = b$\n\n5.  **Solve for the Eigenvector Components:**\n    From equation (1):\n    $b\\sin\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n\n    Using the half-angle trigonometric identities: $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$ and $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$.\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n\n    So, we have $b = a\\tan(\\theta/2)$. The unnormalized eigenvector is $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ a\\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix} = a\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$. We can set $a=1$ for now and normalize later, giving the form $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n6.  **Normalize the Eigenvector:**\n    Let the normalized eigenvector be $|\\psi\\rangle = N \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$. The normalization condition is $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = 1$.\n    $|N|^2 \\left( 1^2 + \\tan^2(\\theta/2) \\right) = 1$\n    Using the identity $1 + \\tan^2(x) = \\sec^2(x)$:\n    $|N|^2 \\sec^2(\\theta/2) = 1$\n    $|N|^2 = \\frac{1}{\\sec^2(\\theta/2)} = \\cos^2(\\theta/2)$\n    Choosing the positive real root, we get the normalization constant $N = \\cos(\\theta/2)$.\n\n    Now, substitute $N$ back into the eigenvector expression:\n    $|\\psi\\rangle = \\cos(\\theta/2) \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\cos(\\theta/2) \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    The elements of the normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
