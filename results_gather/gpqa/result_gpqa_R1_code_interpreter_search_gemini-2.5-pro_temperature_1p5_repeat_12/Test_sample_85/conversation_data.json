    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Products and Reactions**\n\n*   **Product:** Both reactions produce an enantiomer of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered cyclic ester (a delta-lactone). The chiral center is at carbon C4, which bears an ethyl group.\n*   **Reaction 1:** `A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Reaction 2:** `B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n\nThe lactone product is formed by the intramolecular cyclization of a hydroxy-carboxylic acid. For a six-membered lactone, this would be a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid (for reaction 1) or a hydroxy-ester that cyclizes via transesterification (for reaction 2).\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Materials**\n\nThe options provided for starting materials A and B are enantiomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. Let's break down this structure:\n*   It is a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid.\n*   The main chain has 5 carbons.\n*   It has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at one end (C1) and an isobutyl ester group (-COOiBu) at the other end (C5).\n*   The structure is: `iBu-O-C(=O)-CH₂(C5-C4)-CH(Et)(C3)-CH₂(C2)-COOH(C1)`\n*   The chiral center is C3, which is attached to an ethyl group.\n\n**3. Analyze the Reagents (Reducing Agents)**\n\nThe two reactions use different reducing agents with different selectivities:\n\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** This is a moderately strong reducing agent. Crucially, it reduces esters to primary alcohols much faster than it reduces carboxylic acids. In the context of our starting material, LiBH₄ will selectively reduce the ester group.\n    *   `Ester (-COOiBu)` ---> `Primary alcohol (-CH₂OH)`\n    *   `Carboxylic acid (-COOH)` ---> `No reaction (or very slow)`\n\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent has a different selectivity profile. It is excellent for reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols and does so faster than it reduces esters.\n    *   `Carboxylic acid (-COOH)` ---> `Primary alcohol (-CH₂OH)`\n    *   `Ester (-COOiBu)` ---> `No reaction (or slow)`\n\n**4. Trace Reaction 1: Starting Material A to (R)-lactone**\n\n*   **Step 1: Reduction with LiBH₄**\n    *   Starting material A (`iBuOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`) is treated with LiBH₄.\n    *   The ester group at C5 is selectively reduced to a primary alcohol.\n    *   The intermediate formed is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**: `HO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`.\n\n*   **Step 2: Lactonization**\n    *   The H+ workup protonates the carboxylic acid, making it more electrophilic. The hydroxyl group at C5 acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon of the carboxylic acid (C1), forming a six-membered ring.\n    *   This intramolecular esterification produces the lactone, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\n*   **Step 3: Stereochemistry Analysis**\n    *   Let's analyze how the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the groups attached to the chiral center (C3) changes.\n    *   **In Starting Material (A):** The groups on C3 are:\n        1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (ester group)\n        2.  `-CH₂COOH` (acid group)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl group)\n        4.  `-H`\n        The ester group has higher priority than the acid group because the ester's oxygen is attached to a carbon (from isobutyl), while the acid's oxygen is attached to a hydrogen. So, Priority order: **Ester > Acid > Ethyl > H**.\n    *   **In the Intermediate (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid):** The ester group has been reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The groups on C3 are now:\n        1.  `-CH₂COOH` (acid group)\n        2.  `-CH₂CH₂OH` (alcohol group)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl group)\n        4.  `-H`\n        The acid group (`-CH₂-C(O,O,O)`) has higher priority than the alcohol group (`-CH₂-C(H,H,O)`). So, Priority order: **Acid > Alcohol > Ethyl > H**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** During the reduction, the group that was priority #1 (ester) became priority #2 (alcohol), and the group that was priority #2 (acid) became priority #1. When the priorities of two groups on a chiral center are swapped, the stereochemical descriptor (R/S) inverts.\n    *   Therefore, to get an **(R)-lactone**, the starting material A must have the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**5. Trace Reaction 2: Starting Material B to (S)-lactone**\n\n*   **Step 1: Reduction with BH₃**\n    *   Starting material B (`iBuOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`) is treated with BH₃.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group at C1 is selectively reduced to a primary alcohol.\n    *   The intermediate formed is **isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate**: `iBuOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH`.\n\n*   **Step 2: Lactonization**\n    *   The H+ workup catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the carbonyl carbon of the ester. Isobutanol is eliminated, forming the same lactone.\n\n*   **Step 3: Stereochemistry Analysis**\n    *   Let's analyze the CIP priorities again.\n    *   **In Starting Material (B):** Priority order: **Ester > Acid > Ethyl > H**.\n    *   **In the Intermediate (isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate):** The acid group has been reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The groups on C3 are now:\n        1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (ester group)\n        2.  `-CH₂CH₂OH` (alcohol group)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl group)\n        4.  `-H`\n        The ester group (`-CH₂-C(O,O,O)`) has higher priority than the alcohol group (`-CH₂-C(H,H,O)`). So, Priority order: **Ester > Alcohol > Ethyl > H**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** In this reaction, the original priority #1 group (ester) remains #1. The original priority #2 group (acid) becomes the new priority #2 group (alcohol). The overall priority ranking of the four substituents **does not change**.\n    *   Therefore, the stereochemical descriptor (R/S) is retained throughout the reaction.\n    *   To get an **(S)-lactone**, the starting material B must have the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nBoth reactions require the same starting material to produce the respective products.\n*   Starting Material A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   Starting Material B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
