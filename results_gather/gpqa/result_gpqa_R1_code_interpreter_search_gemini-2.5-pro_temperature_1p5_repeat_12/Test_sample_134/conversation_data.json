    "The user is asking for the kinematically allowed decay channels of a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV.\n\n**1. Understanding the Interaction and Decay Process**\n\nThe interaction Lagrangian is given by:\n$\\mathcal{L}_{int} = -\\lambda_f \\bar{\\psi}_f X \\psi_f$\nThis term describes a three-point interaction where the boson X couples to a fermion-antifermion pair ($f\\bar{f}$). This means that at the lowest order, the boson X can decay into a fermion and its corresponding antifermion:\n$X \\rightarrow f\\bar{f}$\n\n**2. Applying the Kinematic Constraint**\n\nFor any decay to be \"kinematically allowed,\" the mass of the decaying particle ($m_X$) must be greater than the sum of the masses of the decay products. In this case:\n$m_X > m_f + m_{\\bar{f}}$\n\nSince a particle and its antiparticle have the same mass ($m_f = m_{\\bar{f}}$), the condition simplifies to:\n$m_X > 2m_f$\n\n**3. Checking the Condition for Standard Model Fermions**\n\nWe are given $m_X = 6$ GeV. We need to check which fermions satisfy the condition $2m_f < 6$ GeV, or $m_f < 3$ GeV.\n\nLet's list the masses of the Standard Model fermions (quarks and charged leptons):\n\n*   **Leptons:**\n    *   Electron ($e$): $m_e \\approx 0.511$ MeV. $2m_e \\approx 1.022$ MeV < 6 GeV. (Allowed)\n    *   Muon ($\\mu$): $m_\\mu \\approx 105.7$ MeV. $2m_\\mu \\approx 211.4$ MeV < 6 GeV. (Allowed)\n    *   Tau ($\\tau$): $m_\\tau \\approx 1777$ MeV = 1.777 GeV. $2m_\\tau \\approx 3.554$ GeV < 6 GeV. (Allowed)\n\n*   **Quarks:**\n    *   Up ($u$): $m_u \\approx 2.2$ MeV. $2m_u \\approx 4.4$ MeV < 6 GeV. (Allowed)\n    *   Down ($d$): $m_d \\approx 4.7$ MeV. $2m_d \\approx 9.4$ MeV < 6 GeV. (Allowed)\n    *   Strange ($s$): $m_s \\approx 95$ MeV. $2m_s \\approx 190$ MeV < 6 GeV. (Allowed)\n    *   Charm ($c$): $m_c \\approx 1270$ MeV = 1.27 GeV. $2m_c \\approx 2.54$ GeV < 6 GeV. (Allowed)\n    *   Bottom ($b$): $m_b \\approx 4180$ MeV = 4.18 GeV. $2m_b \\approx 8.36$ GeV > 6 GeV. (Forbidden)\n    *   Top ($t$): $m_t \\approx 173000$ MeV = 173 GeV. $2m_t \\approx 346$ GeV > 6 GeV. (Forbidden)\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe kinematically allowed decay channels are those into fermion-antifermion pairs where the fermion mass is less than 3 GeV. Based on our analysis, these are:\n*   $X \\rightarrow e^+e^-$\n*   $X \\rightarrow \\mu^+\\mu^-$\n*   $X \\rightarrow \\tau^+\\tau^-$\n*   $X \\rightarrow u\\bar{u}$\n*   $X \\rightarrow d\\bar{d}$\n*   $X \\rightarrow s\\bar{s}$\n*   $X \\rightarrow c\\bar{c}$\n\nNow let's compare this list with the given options:\n\n*   A) $X\\rightarrow b\\bar{b},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$ (Incorrect, includes $b\\bar{b}$)\n*   B) $X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},t\\bar{t},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$ (Incorrect, includes $t\\bar{t}$)\n*   C) $X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$ (Correct, matches our derived list)\n*   D) $X\\rightarrow b\\bar{b},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$ (Incorrect, includes $b\\bar{b}$ and misses $\\mu^+\\mu^-$ and $c\\bar{c}$)\n\nTherefore, the correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
