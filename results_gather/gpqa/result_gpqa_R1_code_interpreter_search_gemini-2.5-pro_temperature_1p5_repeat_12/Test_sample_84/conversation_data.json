    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The main goal is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates. The formula is:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{eff,star} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a}} \\times (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n    where:\n    *   $T_{eff,star}$ is the effective temperature of the star.\n    *   $R_{star}$ is the radius of the star.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n    *   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{T_{eff,star} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1}} \\times (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{eff,star} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2}} \\times (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n    The problem states that the planets orbit the same star, so $T_{eff,star}$ and $R_{star}$ are constant. It also states that both planets have the same albedo (A1 = A2). Therefore, these terms cancel out:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{a_1}}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{a_2}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n    The problem is now reduced to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes, a2 / a1.\n\n4.  **Relate Doppler Shift to Radial Velocity:** The Doppler shift (Δλ) in the star's spectral lines is caused by the star's \"wobble\" as the planet orbits it. This wobble is the star's radial velocity (v_r). The maximum radial velocity is the amplitude K. The relationship is:\n    $v_r = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$\n    where `c` is the speed of light and $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength.\n    The radial velocity amplitude (K) is proportional to the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ_max). So, the ratio of the RV amplitudes for the two planets is:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\ Å}{0.04 \\ Å} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n5.  **Relate Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the radial velocity amplitude (K) induced on the star is given by:\n    $K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_{star}} v_{orb,p} = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_{star}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G(M_{star} + M_p)}{a}}$\n    Given that the planets are detected by the transit method, their orbits must be nearly edge-on, so the inclination `i` ≈ 90° and `sin(i)` ≈ 1. Also, the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass (M_p << M_star). The formula simplifies to:\n    $K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_{star}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_{star}}{a}} = M_p \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{M_{star} a}}$\n\n6.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis (a):** We can rearrange the formula to solve for `a`:\n    $K^2 = M_p^2 \\frac{G}{M_{star} a} \\implies a = \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_{star} K^2}$\n\n7.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a2 / a1):**\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_{star} K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_{star} K_1^2)}$\n    The constants `G` and `M_star` cancel out:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\times \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n8.  **Substitute the Known Values:**\n    *   Mass ratio: $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5 M_{earth}}{7 M_{earth}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n    *   RV amplitude ratio: $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\times \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\n9.  **Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:** Now substitute the ratio of the semi-major axes back into the temperature ratio formula:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{225}}{\\sqrt{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n10. **Final Calculation:** To get the decimal value, we perform the division.\n\n```python\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_eq1 / T_eq2 is the square root of the ratio of semi-major axes a2 / a1.\n# The ratio a2 / a1 is given by (M_p2/M_p1)^2 * (K1/K2)^2.\n# M_p2/M_p1 = 5/7\n# K1/K2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4\n# So, T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt((5/7)^2 * (3/4)^2) = (5/7) * (3/4) = 15/28\n\nresult = 15 / 28\nprint(result)\n```",
    "The calculation shows that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is approximately 0.536.\n\n*   **Step 1:** The ratio of equilibrium temperatures is given by $T_{eq1}/T_{eq2} = \\sqrt{a_2/a_1}$.\n*   **Step 2:** The ratio of the semi-major axes is derived from the radial velocity amplitude formula: $a \\propto (M_p/K)^2$.\n*   **Step 3:** This gives the ratio $a_2/a_1 = (M_{p2}/M_{p1})^2 \\times (K_1/K_2)^2$.\n*   **Step 4:** Plugging in the values: $M_{p2}/M_{p1} = 5/7$ and $K_1/K_2 = 0.03/0.04 = 3/4$.\n*   **Step 5:** So, $a_2/a_1 = (5/7)^2 \\times (3/4)^2 = (25/49) \\times (9/16) = 225/784$.\n*   **Step 6:** Finally, the temperature ratio is $\\sqrt{a_2/a_1} = \\sqrt{225/784} = 15/28 \\approx 0.5357$.\n\nThis value is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
