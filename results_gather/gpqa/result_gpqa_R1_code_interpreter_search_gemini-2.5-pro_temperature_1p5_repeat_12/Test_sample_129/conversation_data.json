    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics:** The problem involves the cosmological redshift of light. As the universe expands, the wavelength of light emitted from a distant object gets stretched. The relationship between the emitted wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{emitted}}$) and the observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{observed}}$) is given by the redshift formula:\n    \n    $\\lambda_{\\text{observed}} = \\lambda_{\\text{emitted}} (1 + z)$\n    \n    where $z$ is the redshift.\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Values:**\n    *   The light is from the Lyman-alpha (Ly-$\\alpha$) transition of neutral hydrogen. The rest-frame (emitted) wavelength of this transition is given as approximately 1216 Å (Angstroms). The more precise value is 1215.67 Å.\n    *   This Ly-$\\alpha$ line is in the far-ultraviolet (FUV) part of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\n3.  **Understand the Constraint:** The detection is to be done with \"optical ground-based telescopes\". This is the crucial constraint. The Earth's atmosphere is opaque to most ultraviolet radiation, primarily due to absorption by ozone (O₃). For light to reach a telescope on the ground, its wavelength must fall within the \"atmospheric window\". The optical atmospheric window begins at a wavelength of approximately 3500 Å (or 350 nm), where the atmosphere starts to become transparent. Therefore, to be detected, the redshifted Lyman-alpha line must have an observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{observed}}$) greater than this cutoff.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Calculation:** We are looking for the *lower limit* on the redshift ($z$). This means we need to find the minimum $z$ that shifts the Ly-$\\alpha$ line just into the observable window. So, we set the observed wavelength to the atmospheric cutoff wavelength.\n\n    $\\lambda_{\\text{cutoff}} \\le \\lambda_{\\text{observed}} = \\lambda_{\\text{emitted}} (1 + z)$\n\n    To find the minimum redshift, we use the equality:\n\n    $\\lambda_{\\text{cutoff}} = \\lambda_{\\text{emitted}} (1 + z_{\\text{min}})$\n\n    Rearranging for $z_{\\text{min}}$:\n\n    $z_{\\text{min}} = (\\lambda_{\\text{cutoff}} / \\lambda_{\\text{emitted}}) - 1$\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   $\\lambda_{\\text{emitted}} = 1216$ Å\n    *   $\\lambda_{\\text{cutoff}} \\approx 3500$ Å (This is a standard approximate value for the beginning of the atmospheric optical window).\n\n    $z_{\\text{min}} = (3500 / 1216) - 1$\n    $z_{\\text{min}} = 2.878 - 1$\n    $z_{\\text{min}} = 1.878$\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:** The calculated lower limit for the redshift is approximately 1.88. Let's examine the given choices:\n    *   A) 1.9\n    *   B) 2.4\n    *   C) 1.2\n    *   D) 3\n\n    Our calculated value of 1.88 is extremely close to option A, 1.9.\n\n    To confirm, let's calculate the observed wavelength for each option:\n    *   For $z = 1.9$, $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = 1216 \\times (1 + 1.9) = 1216 \\times 2.9 = 3526.4$ Å. This is just above the 3500 Å atmospheric cutoff and is detectable.\n    *   For $z = 1.2$, $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = 1216 \\times (1 + 1.2) = 2675.2$ Å. This is deep in the UV and blocked by the atmosphere.\n    *   Redshifts of 2.4 and 3 would result in observed wavelengths of 4134.4 Å and 4864 Å, respectively. These are easily detectable, but the question asks for the *lower limit*, making 1.9 the most appropriate answer.\n\nThe lower limit on the redshift is the minimum value required to shift the 1216 Å Lyman-alpha line into the wavelength range accessible from the ground, which starts around 3500 Å. A redshift of approximately 1.9 achieves this.\n\n<<<A>>>"
