    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the non-permitted partial wave.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Initial State and Conservation Laws\n\n*   **Initial State:** A bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state.\n    *   The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` for `1S0` gives us:\n        *   Total spin `S_i`: `2S_i + 1 = 1` => `S_i = 0`.\n        *   Orbital angular momentum `L_i`: The letter 'S' corresponds to `L_i = 0`.\n        *   Total angular momentum `J_i`: The number '0' means `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The initial parity is given by `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **Particle X:**\n    *   Intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`.\n    *   Its orbital angular momentum relative to the NN system is `l_X`.\n\n*   **Final State:** The system decays into a final NN state `(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)` and particle X.\n\n*   **Conservation of Angular Momentum:**\n    *   The total angular momentum must be conserved: `J_initial = J_final`.\n    *   `J_initial` is `J_i = 0`.\n    *   `J_final` is the vector sum of the final NN system's total angular momentum (`J_f`) and the orbital angular momentum of particle X (`l_X`).\n    *   The vector equation `J_f + l_X = J_i = 0` implies that the magnitudes must be equal: `J_f = l_X`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Parity:**\n    *   The total parity must be conserved: `P_initial = P_final`.\n    *   `P_initial = +1`.\n    *   The final parity is the product of the parities of the components: `P_final = P(NN_final) * P(X) * P_orbital(X)`.\n    *   `P(NN_final) = (-1)^L_f`.\n    *   `P(X) = -1` (given).\n    *   `P_orbital(X) = (-1)^l_X`.\n    *   So, `P_final = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X = -(-1)^(L_f + l_X)`.\n    *   Equating initial and final parities: `+1 = -(-1)^(L_f + l_X)`, which simplifies to `(-1)^(L_f + l_X) = -1`.\n    *   This requires the exponent `L_f + l_X` to be an **odd** integer.\n\n*   **Pauli Statistics for the Final NN State:**\n    *   The problem states a rule `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`, which is equivalent to the standard rule that `T+S+L` must be an odd integer for a two-nucleon system.\n    *   We are given that the final NN state has isospin `T_f = 0`.\n    *   Substituting `T_f = 0` into the rule, we get `0 + S_f + L_f` must be odd.\n    *   This means `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** integer.\n\n### 2. Summary of Conditions for a Permitted Transition\n\nA transition `1S0 -> (2S_f+1)L_f(J_f) + x` (where x has orbital angular momentum `l_X`) is permitted only if all three of the following conditions are met:\n1.  **Angular Momentum Conservation:** `J_f = l_X`\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** `L_f + l_X` is odd.\n3.  **Pauli Principle (for T_f=0):** `S_f + L_f` is odd.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will now check each option against these three conditions. We decode the final NN term symbol `(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)` and the particle's angular momentum state (e.g., s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3).\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state `3P0`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X state `s`: `l_X=0`.\n1.  `J_f = l_X`?  => `0 = 0`. **(OK)**\n2.  `L_f + l_X` odd? => `1 + 0 = 1`. **(OK)**\n3.  `S_f + L_f` odd? => `1 + 1 = 2` (even). **(FAIL)**\nThis transition is not permitted because it violates the Pauli principle for the final state.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `3S1`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X state `p`: `l_X=1`.\n1.  `J_f = l_X`?  => `1 = 1`. **(OK)**\n2.  `L_f + l_X` odd? => `0 + 1 = 1`. **(OK)**\n3.  `S_f + L_f` odd? => `1 + 0 = 1`. **(OK)**\nThis transition is permitted.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `7D1`: `2S_f+1=7` => `S_f=3`. `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X state `p`: `l_X=1`.\n*   Note: A two-nucleon system (two spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin of S=0 or S=1. `S_f=3` is physically impossible. Therefore, this reaction is not permitted because the final state cannot exist. However, let's check the transition rules as requested by the problem.\n1.  `J_f = l_X`?  => `1 = 1`. **(OK)**\n2.  `L_f + l_X` odd? => `2 + 1 = 3`. **(OK)**\n3.  `S_f + L_f` odd? => `3 + 2 = 5`. **(OK)**\nWhile this transition passes the specified conservation rules, it is forbidden because the final state is unphysical.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state `3D3`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X state `f`: `l_X=3`.\n1.  `J_f = l_X`?  => `3 = 3`. **(OK)**\n2.  `L_f + l_X` odd? => `2 + 3 = 5`. **(OK)**\n3.  `S_f + L_f` odd? => `1 + 2 = 3`. **(OK)**\nThis transition is permitted.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth options A and C represent forbidden transitions.\n*   Option A is forbidden because it violates the Pauli statistics rule for the final state, which was one of the specific rules the problem asked to use.\n*   Option C is forbidden for a more fundamental reason: the proposed final state (`7D1`) is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system.\n\nIn the context of such physics problems, when asked to apply a specific set of rules, the intended answer is the one that violates one of those rules directly. Option A is the only choice that fails one of the three explicitly required checks (Angular Momentum, Parity, Pauli).\n\n<<<A>>>"
