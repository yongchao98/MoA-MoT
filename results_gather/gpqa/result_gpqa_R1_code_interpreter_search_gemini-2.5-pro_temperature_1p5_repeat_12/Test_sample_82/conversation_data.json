    "This problem requires calculating the pH at two specific points during the titration of a diluted weak acid (acetic acid) with a strong base (NaOH).\n\n**1. Initial State and Dilution**\n\n*   First, we determine the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted with water.\n*   Initial moles of acetic acid (CH₃COOH):\n    `moles = Concentration × Volume = 0.05 M × 0.020 L = 0.001 mol`\n*   The total volume after adding water is:\n    `V_total = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.040 L`\n*   The new concentration of the diluted acetic acid is:\n    `C_diluted = moles / V_total = 0.001 mol / 0.040 L = 0.025 M`\n\n**2. pH at 25% Titration**\n\n*   At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), and 75% remains as unreacted acetic acid.\n*   This creates a buffer solution. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH:\n    `pH = pKa + log([conjugate base] / [acid])`\n*   The ratio `[conjugate base] / [acid]` is `0.25 / 0.75 = 1/3`.\n*   First, we calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n    `pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵)`\n*   Now, we calculate the pH:\n    `pH = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) + log(1/3)`\n    `pH = 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256`\n*   So, the pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.\n\n**3. pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n*   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been completely neutralized by the NaOH to form sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The solution contains `0.001 mol` of the conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻).\n*   First, we need to find the volume of NaOH added to reach the equivalence point (`V_eq`):\n    `moles_acid = C_NaOH × V_eq`\n    `0.001 mol = 0.1 M × V_eq`\n    `V_eq = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³`\n*   The total volume of the solution at the equivalence point is:\n    `V_total_eq = V_diluted + V_eq = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L`\n*   The concentration of the acetate ion ([CH₃COO⁻]) in the solution is:\n    `[CH₃COO⁻] = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M`\n*   The acetate ion is a weak base and will hydrolyze in water, producing OH⁻ ions:\n    `CH₃COO⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ CH₃COOH(aq) + OH⁻(aq)`\n*   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for this reaction:\n    `Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) = 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰`\n*   We can now find the hydroxide ion concentration, [OH⁻], using the Kb expression:\n    `Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]`\n    `5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)`\n    Assuming `x` is much smaller than 0.02, we can simplify:\n    `5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ ≈ x² / 0.02`\n    `x² = (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 = 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹`\n    `x = [OH⁻] = √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) = 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M`\n*   Now, we calculate the pOH and then the pH:\n    `pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) = 5.48`\n    `pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52`\n*   So, the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\nThe calculated values are pH ≈ 4.26 at 25% titration and pH ≈ 8.52 at the equivalence point. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
