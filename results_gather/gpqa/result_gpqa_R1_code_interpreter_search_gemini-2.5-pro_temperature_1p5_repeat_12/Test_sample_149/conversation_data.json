    "**1. Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting compound from the molecular formula (C8H9NO) and 1H-NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation (DBE).\n    DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2) = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    A DBE of 5 suggests a benzene ring (DBE=4) and a carbonyl group (C=O, DBE=1).\n\n*   **1H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) splitting indicates it is coupled to an adjacent methylene group (-CH2-), according to the n+1 rule (2+1=3 peaks). This suggests a `-CH2-CHO` fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to the aldehyde. The doublet (d) splitting confirms it is coupled to a single proton (the aldehyde proton, n+1=1+1=2 peaks). The chemical shift is consistent with a CH2 group attached to both an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group. This confirms the `-CH2-CHO` fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, both doublets and integrating to 2 protons each, strongly indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two types of aromatic protons are ortho-coupled to each other. The presence of signals at relatively high field (especially 6.51 ppm) suggests a strong electron-donating group on the ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is very typical for a primary amine group (-NH2), which is a strong electron-donating group. The broadness is due to quadrupole relaxation of the nitrogen nucleus and/or chemical exchange.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring (`C6H4`).\n    *   The substituents are an amino group (`-NH2`) and an acetaldehyde group (`-CH2CHO`).\n    *   Let's check the molecular formula: `C6H4` + `NH2` + `C2H3O` = `C8H9NO`. This matches the given formula.\n    *   The structure is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. The amino group at C1 makes the ortho protons (C2, C6) shielded (upfield), and the acetaldehyde group at C4 makes its ortho protons (C3, C5) deshielded (downfield). This is consistent with the signals at 6.51 ppm (ortho to NH2) and 6.98 ppm (ortho to CH2CHO).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\nThe starting material is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Reagents 1 & 2: 1. NaNO2 + HCl; 2. H2O**\n    *   This is a two-step process to convert a primary aromatic amine into a phenol.\n    *   Step 1 (NaNO2 + HCl at 0-5 °C) is diazotization, which converts the primary amine (-NH2) into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n        `p-NH2-C6H4-CH2CHO` -> `p-Cl-N2+-C6H4-CH2CHO`\n    *   Step 2 (H2O, warm) is the hydrolysis of the diazonium salt. The -N2+ group is an excellent leaving group (it leaves as N2 gas) and is replaced by an -OH group from water.\n        `p-Cl-N2+-C6H4-CH2CHO` -> `p-HO-C6H4-CH2CHO`\n    *   The product of these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   This reagent provides a strong base (KOH) and heat, which are the classic conditions for an **Aldol Condensation**.\n    *   The aldehyde, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, has acidic α-protons on the methylene group (`-CH2-`) adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n\n    *   **Aldol Condensation Mechanism:**\n        1.  **Enolate Formation:** A hydroxide ion (OH-) removes an α-proton from one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n            `HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO + OH- <=> [HO-C6H4-CH-CHO]- + H2O`\n        2.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n            `[HO-C6H4-CH-CHO]-` + `HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO` -> `HO-C6H4-CH2-CH(O-)-CH(C6H4OH)-CHO`\n        3.  **Protonation:** The resulting alkoxide is protonated by water to give the aldol addition product, a β-hydroxy aldehyde.\n            `HO-C6H4-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(C6H4OH)-CHO`\n            The IUPAC name for this intermediate is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option B).\n\n        4.  **Dehydration:** The reaction is performed under **heat**, which promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product to form a more stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The base (OH-) removes the acidic proton from the α-carbon (C2), and the hydroxyl group from the β-carbon (C3) is eliminated.\n            `HO-C6H4-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(C6H4OH)-CHO` --(Heat, -H2O)--> `HO-C6H4-CH2-CH=C(C6H4OH)-CHO`\n\n    *   **Identifying the Final Product:**\n        The structure is `HO-C6H4-CH2-CH=C(C6H4OH)-CHO`.\n        Let's name it according to IUPAC rules:\n        - The main chain is a butenal (4 carbons, C=C, CHO).\n        - The aldehyde is C1.\n        - The double bond is between C2 and C3, so it's a `but-2-enal`.\n        - There is a `4-hydroxyphenyl` group on C2.\n        - There is a `4-hydroxyphenyl` group on C4 (as part of the `HO-C6H4-CH2-` group).\n        - The name is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the derived product with the given options.**\n\n*   A) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect structure.\n*   B) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the aldol addition intermediate, not the final product under heating conditions.\n*   C) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: This matches our derived final product of the aldol condensation.\n*   D) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect substituents (should be hydroxyphenyl) and incorrect double bond position.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the reaction sequence is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<C>>>"
