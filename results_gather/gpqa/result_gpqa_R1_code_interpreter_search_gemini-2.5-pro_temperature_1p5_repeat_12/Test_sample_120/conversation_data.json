    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type\n\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`.\n    *   The `bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` core structure is a cyclohexane ring fused to a cyclopropane ring.\n    *   The `7-oxa` designation indicates that the single atom bridge (the '0' in [4.1.0]) is an oxygen atom. This is the structure of an epoxide fused to a cyclohexane ring. The epoxide is formed between the bridgehead carbons, C1 and C6.\n    *   The substituents are three methyl groups located at positions C1, C3, and C4 of the bicyclic system.\n    *   The stereochemistry is given by the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog descriptors: (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S).\n\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is `Me2CuLi`, which is lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent. In epoxide opening reactions, Gilman reagents act as a source of a soft nucleophile, in this case, a methyl carbanion equivalent (Me⁻).\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate.\n\n### 2. Apply the Rules of the Reaction\n\nThe problem explicitly states two key rules for this reaction:\n1.  **Regioselectivity:** The alkyl group of the organocuprate (the methyl group) is always introduced at the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n2.  **Stereoselectivity:** Inversion of configuration occurs at the carbon to which the nucleophile (Nu) is added. This is characteristic of an Sₙ2-type mechanism.\n\n### 3. Determine the Site of Nucleophilic Attack (Regioselectivity)\n\n*   The epoxide ring is formed by atoms O7, C1, and C6.\n*   We need to compare the steric hindrance at C1 and C6.\n*   According to the IUPAC name, C1 has a methyl group (`1-trimethyl...`).\n*   C6 does not have a methyl substituent; it is bonded to a hydrogen atom.\n*   Comparing a carbon atom with a methyl group (C1) to one with a hydrogen atom (C6), **C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon**.\n*   Therefore, the methyl nucleophile (Me⁻) from Me₂CuLi will attack C6.\n\n### 4. Determine the Outcome of the Reaction\n\n*   **Attack at C6:** The nucleophilic attack of Me⁻ on C6 breaks the C6-O bond.\n*   **Bond Formation:** A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between the incoming methyl group and C6.\n*   **Bond Cleavage:** The C6-O bond of the epoxide breaks, and the electrons move to the oxygen atom. The C1-O bond remains intact initially.\n*   **Product type:** After an aqueous workup (which is implied to protonate the resulting alkoxide), the oxygen atom attached to C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The final product is a substituted cyclohexanol.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:**\n    *   The original methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4 are still present.\n    *   A new methyl group is added at C6.\n    *   The epoxide oxygen at C1 becomes an alcohol.\n    *   So, the product will be a tetramethylcyclohexanol.\n\n### 5. Name the Product and Determine Stereochemistry\n\n*   **Renumbering:** According to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (-OH) receives the lowest possible locant, which will be C1. Therefore, the carbon that was C1 in the starting material is now the **new C1** in the product.\n*   **Locants:** To assign the lowest locants to the methyl substituents, we number the ring starting from the new C1. The methyl groups are on:\n    *   New C1 (the original methyl group on old C1).\n    *   The carbon that was old C6 (where the new methyl group attached).\n    *   The carbon that was old C3.\n    *   The carbon that was old C4.\n    If we number clockwise from new C1, the old C6 becomes new C2. This gives the substitution pattern 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexanol. Numbering counter-clockwise would give a higher set of locants (1,3,4,6). Thus, the correct name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options C and D.\n\n*   **Stereochemistry:**\n    1.  **At New C1 (Old C1):** The bonds to this carbon were not broken during the reaction. Therefore, its absolute configuration is retained. It was (1R) and it remains **(1R)**.\n    2.  **At New C2 (Old C6):** This carbon was the site of the Sₙ2 attack. The rules state that its configuration is inverted. It was (6S), so it becomes **(R)**. In the new numbering system, this is position 2, so it is **(2R)**.\n    3.  **At New C4 (Old C4):** This stereocenter was not involved in the reaction. Its configuration is retained. It was (4R) and it remains **(4R)**.\n    4.  **At New C5 (Old C3):** This stereocenter was also not involved. Its configuration is retained. It was (3R) and it remains **(5R)** in the new numbering system.\n\n*   **Final Product:** Combining the name and the stereochemistry gives **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n### 6. Conclusion\n\nComparing our derived product name with the given options:\nA) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\nB) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\nC) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\nD) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n\nOur result, (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol, matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
