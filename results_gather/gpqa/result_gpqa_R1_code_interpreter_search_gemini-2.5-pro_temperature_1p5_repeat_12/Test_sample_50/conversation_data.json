    "This problem can be solved using the method of images, a standard technique in electrostatics.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the System:** The system consists of a point charge `q` and a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. The charge `q` is located at a distance `d` from the center of the sphere (`d > R`). \"Grounded\" means the electric potential of the sphere is held at zero (V = 0).\n\n2.  **Apply the Method of Images:** The electric field and potential outside the sphere can be modeled by replacing the sphere with a single \"image charge\" (`q'`) placed at a specific location inside the sphere's original volume. The goal is to choose `q'` and its position `d'` such that the potential on the spherical surface of radius `R` is zero.\n\n3.  **Determine the Image Charge and its Position:** For a point charge `q` at distance `d` from the center of a grounded sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` and its position `d'` (measured from the center) are given by the standard formulas:\n    *   Image charge magnitude: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   Image charge position: `d' = R^2 / d`\n    The image charge lies on the line connecting the center of the sphere and the external charge `q`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy:** The net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its position at distance `d`. A general formula for the electrostatic potential energy of a system of charges and conductors is:\n    `U = (1/2) * Σ q_i * V_i`\n    where `q_i` are the charges and `V_i` is the potential at the location of `q_i` due to all *other* charges in the system.\n\n5.  **Apply the Energy Formula to Our System:**\n    *   Our system consists of the point charge `q` and the induced charge on the grounded sphere.\n    *   The potential of the sphere is `V_sphere = 0` (it is grounded).\n    *   The potential at the location of the point charge `q`, due to the induced charge on the sphere, is `V_induced`.\n    *   The formula becomes: `U = (1/2) * (q * V_induced + q_induced_total * V_sphere)`\n    *   Since `V_sphere = 0`, the second term vanishes: `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\n6.  **Calculate `V_induced`:**\n    *   The potential `V_induced` at the location of `q` is, by the method of images, equal to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that same location.\n    *   The charge `q` is at a distance `d` from the center.\n    *   The image charge `q'` is at a distance `d' = R^2/d` from the center.\n    *   The distance between `q` and `q'` is `r = d - d' = d - R^2/d`.\n    *   The potential created by `q'` at the location of `q` is:\n        `V_induced = k * q' / r`\n        where `k` is Coulomb's constant (`1/(4πε₀)`).\n\n7.  **Substitute and Simplify:**\n    *   Substitute the expressions for `q'` and `r`:\n        `V_induced = k * [-q(R/d)] / [d - R^2/d]`\n    *   Simplify the denominator:\n        `d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n    *   Substitute this back into the expression for `V_induced`:\n        `V_induced = k * [-q(R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\n    *   The `d` in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n        `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n8.  **Calculate the Final Potential Energy `U`:**\n    *   Now substitute this `V_induced` back into our energy formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`:\n        `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    *   `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n9.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   The derived expression `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)` matches option B exactly.\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the force between the charge and the grounded sphere is attractive, so the potential energy decreases as the charge is brought closer from infinity.\n\n<<<B>>>"
