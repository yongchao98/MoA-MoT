    "*   **Analysis of the first reaction:**\n    *   The reaction is: `butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile`.\n    *   This is a classic example of **cyanohydrin formation**. In this reaction, a ketone (butan-2-one) reacts with a cyanide source (NaCN).\n    *   The mechanism involves the nucleophilic attack of the cyanide ion (`CN⁻`) on the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate.\n    *   This intermediate then needs to be protonated to form the final product, which has a hydroxyl (`-OH`) group. Reagent **A** must therefore be a source of protons (`H⁺`).\n    *   `H₃O⁺` (hydronium ion) represents an acidic aqueous solution (e.g., dilute HCl or H₂SO₄) and is the standard reagent used to provide the necessary protons for this step. `NaHSO₃` is used for bisulfite addition reactions and is not suitable here. Therefore, **A = H₃O⁺**.\n\n*   **Analysis of the second reaction:**\n    *   The reaction is: `2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid`.\n    *   This reaction shows the conversion of a nitrile group (`-CN`) into a carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`). This is a **hydrolysis of a nitrile**.\n    *   Nitrile hydrolysis can be catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base, typically with heating. The presence of `H₂O` is explicitly mentioned.\n    *   Reagent **B** is the catalyst for this hydrolysis.\n    *   `HCl` is a strong acid and is a very common and effective catalyst for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.\n    *   `CH₃COOH` (acetic acid) is a weak acid and is generally not effective enough to carry out this transformation efficiently.\n    *   Therefore, **B = HCl** is the most suitable reagent.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   Based on the analysis, reagent A is `H₃O⁺` and reagent B is `HCl`.\n    *   This combination corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
