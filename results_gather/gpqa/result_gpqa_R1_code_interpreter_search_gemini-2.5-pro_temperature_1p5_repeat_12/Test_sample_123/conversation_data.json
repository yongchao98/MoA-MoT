    "Here is the reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:** The problem involves the decay of relativistic particles. The key concepts are:\n    *   **Radioactive Decay Law:** The number of undecayed particles `N` at time `t` from an initial sample `N₀` is given by `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / τ)`, where `τ` is the mean lifetime of the particle. The fraction of surviving particles is `N/N₀ = exp(-t / τ)`.\n    *   **Special Relativity (Time Dilation):** A moving particle's lifetime appears longer to a stationary observer. This observed lifetime in the lab frame (`τ_lab`) is related to the particle's intrinsic or proper lifetime (`τ₀`) by the Lorentz factor (`γ`): `τ_lab = γ * τ₀`.\n    *   **Time of Flight:** The particles are ultra-relativistic, meaning their speed `v` is very close to the speed of light `c`. The time it takes for them to travel the detector radius `R` in the lab frame is `t_lab = R / v ≈ R / c`.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Survival Equation:**\n    *   We can combine these concepts. The fraction of particles that survive the journey to the detector wall is:\n        `N/N₀ = exp(-t_lab / τ_lab)`\n    *   Substituting the expressions for `t_lab` and `τ_lab`:\n        `N/N₀ = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ₀))`\n    *   This can be written as:\n        `N/N₀ = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ₀))`\n    *   The term `c * τ₀` is a constant for a given type of particle, representing its mean decay length in its own rest frame. Let's call the constant `K = R / (c * τ₀)`.\n    *   The simplified survival equation is:\n        `N/N₀ = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n3.  **Use the Initial Conditions:**\n    *   We are given that when the Lorentz factor `γ₁` is 20, one-third of the particles reach the wall.\n    *   `γ₁ = 20`\n    *   `N₁/N₀ = 1/3`\n    *   Plugging these into our equation:\n        `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n    *   To solve for the constant `K`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n        `-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n        `K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n4.  **Solve for the New Lorentz Factor:**\n    *   We want to find the new Lorentz factor `γ₂` required for two-thirds of the particles to reach the wall.\n    *   `N₂/N₀ = 2/3`\n    *   `γ₂ = ?`\n    *   Using the same survival equation with the new values:\n        `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n    *   Take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`\n        `-ln(3/2) = -K / γ₂`\n        `ln(3/2) = K / γ₂`\n    *   Now we can solve for `γ₂`:\n        `γ₂ = K / ln(3/2)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    *   Substitute the value of `K` we found in step 3 into the equation for `γ₂`:\n        `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)`\n    *   Now, we can compute this value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# We need to solve for gamma_2 in the equation: gamma_2 = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)\n# where ln is the natural logarithm.\ngamma_1 = 20\nsurvival_fraction_1 = 1/3\nsurvival_fraction_2 = 2/3\n\n# From the survival equation N/N0 = exp(-constant / gamma), we have:\n# ln(N/N0) = -constant / gamma  => constant = -gamma * ln(N/N0)\n# The constant is the same in both scenarios.\n# -gamma_1 * ln(survival_fraction_1) = -gamma_2 * ln(survival_fraction_2)\n# gamma_1 * ln(1 / survival_fraction_1) = gamma_2 * ln(1 / survival_fraction_2)\n# gamma_2 = gamma_1 * ln(1 / survival_fraction_1) / ln(1 / survival_fraction_2)\n# gamma_2 = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)\n\ngamma_2 = 20 * math.log(3) / math.log(1.5)\n\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\n\n>>>54.18449914701139\n\nThe calculated value is approximately 54.18, which is very close to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing physical principles.** The problem involves the decay of relativistic particles. The key concepts are the law of radioactive decay and time dilation from special relativity.\n\n2.  **Formulate the particle survival equation.**\n    *   The fraction of particles `N/N₀` that survive after a time `t` is given by the exponential decay law:\n        `N/N₀ = exp(-t_lab / τ_lab)`\n        where `t_lab` is the time elapsed in the laboratory frame, and `τ_lab` is the mean lifetime of the particles as measured in the laboratory frame.\n\n    *   According to the theory of special relativity, a moving particle's lifetime is dilated (appears longer) from the perspective of a stationary observer. This is given by:\n        `τ_lab = γ * τ₀`\n        where `γ` is the Lorentz factor and `τ₀` is the proper mean lifetime (the lifetime in the particle's own rest frame).\n\n    *   The particles are ultra-relativistic, so their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. The time it takes for them to travel the detector radius `R` in the lab frame is:\n        `t_lab ≈ R / c`\n\n    *   Substituting `t_lab` and `τ_lab` into the decay equation gives the fraction of particles reaching the detector wall:\n        `N/N₀ = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ₀)) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ₀))`\n\n3.  **Analyze the equation and use the given information.**\n    *   The term `R / (c * τ₀)` is a constant for this specific experimental setup and particle type. Let's call this constant `K`. The survival equation simplifies to:\n        `N/N₀ = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n    *   We are given the first scenario: When the Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`, one-third of the particles survive, so `N₁/N₀ = 1/3`. We can use this to find the constant `K`.\n        `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n\n    *   To solve for `K`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n        `-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n        `K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n4.  **Solve for the unknown Lorentz factor.**\n    *   We now want to find the new Lorentz factor `γ₂` that allows two-thirds of the particles to survive: `N₂/N₀ = 2/3`.\n        `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n\n    *   Again, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`\n        `-ln(3/2) = -K / γ₂`\n        `ln(3/2) = K / γ₂`\n\n    *   Now we solve for `γ₂`:\n        `γ₂ = K / ln(3/2)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the final value.**\n    *   Substitute the expression for `K` from step 3 into the equation for `γ₂`:\n        `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)`\n\n    *   Now we compute this value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# From the reasoning: gamma_2 = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)\n# Let's calculate this value.\n\ngamma_1 = 20\nsurvival_fraction_1 = 1/3\nsurvival_fraction_2 = 2/3\n\n# We have the relationship: -gamma * ln(N/N0) = constant\n# So, -gamma_1 * ln(survival_fraction_1) = -gamma_2 * ln(survival_fraction_2)\n# gamma_2 = gamma_1 * ln(survival_fraction_1) / ln(survival_fraction_2)\n# gamma_2 = 20 * ln(1/3) / ln(2/3)\n# gamma_2 = 20 * (-ln(3)) / (-ln(3/2))\n# gamma_2 = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)\n\ngamma_2 = 20 * math.log(3) / math.log(3/2)\n\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 54.19. Looking at the multiple-choice options, 54 is the closest value.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The reasoning and calculation are as follows:\n\n1.  **Survival Probability:** The fraction of particles that survive, `N/N₀`, is determined by the exponential decay law `N/N₀ = exp(-t/τ)`, where `t` is the time of flight in the lab frame and `τ` is the dilated lifetime in the lab frame.\n\n2.  **Relativistic Effects:**\n    *   The time of flight to the detector wall (radius `R`) is `t = R/v`. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their velocity `v` is very close to the speed of light `c`, so `t ≈ R/c`.\n    *   The particle's lifetime in the lab frame (`τ`) is dilated by the Lorentz factor `γ` from its proper lifetime `τ₀`: `τ = γ * τ₀`.\n\n3.  **Combined Equation:** Substituting these into the survival equation gives:\n    `N/N₀ = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ₀))`\n\n4.  **Solving for the Unknowns:**\n    Let `K = R / (c * τ₀)` be a constant that depends on the detector radius and the particle's intrinsic properties. The equation becomes:\n    `N/N₀ = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n    *   **Case 1:** Given that `N/N₀ = 1/3` when `γ₁ = 20`.\n        `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n        Taking the natural log of both sides: `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n        Which simplifies to: `K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n    *   **Case 2:** We need to find `γ₂` when `N/N₀ = 2/3`.\n        `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n        Taking the natural log: `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`\n        Solving for `γ₂`: `γ₂ = -K / ln(2/3) = K / ln(3/2)`\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:** Substitute the expression for `K` from Case 1 into the equation for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)`\n\nThe provided code calculated this value:\n`gamma_2 = 20 * math.log(3) / math.log(1.5) ≈ 54.19`\n\nThis calculated value is closest to the option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
