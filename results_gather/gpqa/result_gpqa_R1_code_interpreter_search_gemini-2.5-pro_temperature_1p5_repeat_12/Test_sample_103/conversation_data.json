    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity**\n\n    The Radial Velocity (RV) method relies on the Doppler effect. The observed shift in the wavelength of a spectral line ($\\Delta \\lambda$) is directly proportional to the radial velocity ($v_r$) of the star along our line of sight. The formula is:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta \\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c}$\n    where $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n    The problem gives the *amplitude* of the periodic wavelength shift ($\\Delta \\lambda_{max}$). This corresponds to the *amplitude* of the star's radial velocity, denoted as $K$. Therefore, $K$ is directly proportional to $\\Delta \\lambda_{max}$.\n\n    We can write the ratio of the velocity amplitudes for the two stars as:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_{max, 2}}{\\Delta \\lambda_{max, 1}} = \\frac{7 \\text{ miliangstrom}}{5 \\text{ miliangstrom}} = 1.4$\n\n2.  **Relate Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Parameters**\n\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the gravitational force provides the centripetal force:\n    $\\frac{G M_{star} M_{planet}}{a^2} = M_{planet} \\frac{v_{planet}^2}{a}$\n    where $a$ is the orbital radius (semi-major axis).\n\n    The star also orbits the common center of mass. Due to conservation of momentum, $M_{star} v_{star} = M_{planet} v_{planet}$. The velocity amplitude we observe, $K$, is the maximum line-of-sight velocity of the star, so $K = v_{star} \\sin(i)$, where $i$ is the orbital inclination. Assuming the inclinations are comparable, we can focus on $v_{star}$.\n\n    $v_{star} = \\frac{M_{planet}}{M_{star}} v_{planet}$\n\n    We can express $v_{planet}$ using Kepler's Third Law.\n    $P^2 = \\frac{4 \\pi^2}{G (M_{star} + M_{planet})} a^3 \\approx \\frac{4 \\pi^2}{G M_{star}} a^3$ (since $M_{planet} \\ll M_{star}$).\n    Also, for a circular orbit, $v_{planet} = \\frac{2 \\pi a}{P}$.\n\n    Let's derive the relationship between $K$ and $P$. It is more direct to use the expression for $v_{star}$:\n    $K \\propto v_{star} = \\frac{M_{planet}}{M_{star}} v_{planet}$\n    From Kepler's Third Law, we can find $a$:\n    $a = \\left( \\frac{G M_{star} P^2}{4 \\pi^2} \\right)^{1/3}$\n\n    Substitute this into the expression for $v_{planet}$:\n    $v_{planet} = \\frac{2 \\pi}{P} a = \\frac{2 \\pi}{P} \\left( \\frac{G M_{star} P^2}{4 \\pi^2} \\right)^{1/3} = (2\\pi)^{1-2/3} (G M_{star})^{1/3} P^{-1+2/3} = (2\\pi)^{1/3} (G M_{star})^{1/3} P^{-1/3}$\n\n    Now substitute this into the expression for $v_{star}$ (and thus $K$):\n    $K \\propto v_{star} = \\frac{M_{planet}}{M_{star}} (2\\pi G M_{star})^{1/3} P^{-1/3}$\n    $K \\propto \\frac{M_{planet}}{M_{star}^{2/3}} P^{-1/3}$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Ratio of Orbital Periods**\n\n    The problem states that the masses of the stars are the same ($M_{star1} = M_{star2}$) and the masses of the planets are the same ($M_{planet1} = M_{planet2}$). Therefore, the term $\\frac{M_{planet}}{M_{star}^{2/3}}$ is a constant for both systems.\n\n    This leaves us with the proportionality:\n    $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\n    We can write this as a ratio:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\left( \\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\right)^{-1/3} = \\left( \\frac{P_1}{P_2} \\right)^{1/3}$\n\n    We want to find the ratio $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$. Let's rearrange the equation:\n    $\\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \\left( \\frac{K_2}{K_1} \\right)^3$\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left( \\frac{K_1}{K_2} \\right)^3$\n\n    Substitute the known ratio of the velocity amplitudes:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left( \\frac{5}{7} \\right)^3$\n\n4.  **Final Calculation**\n\n    Now we compute the value.\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\frac{5^3}{7^3} = \\frac{125}{343}$\n\n    To get a decimal value:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\approx 0.3644$\n\n    This value is closest to option D.\n    ```python\n    # Calculation for confirmation\n    ratio = (5/7)**3\n    print(ratio)\n    ```\n<execute_result>\n0.36443148688046646\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to planet #1 is approximately 0.36.\n\n<<<D>>>"
