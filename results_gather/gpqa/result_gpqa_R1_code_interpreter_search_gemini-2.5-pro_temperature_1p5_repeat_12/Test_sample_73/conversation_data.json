    "This problem deals with the radioactive decay of a single atom, which follows an exponential probability distribution. A key property of this distribution is that it is \"memoryless\". This means the probability of the atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already survived.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the Radioactive Decay Law**\n\nThe probability P that an atom survives past a certain time *t* is given by the survival function:\nP(survival > t) = e^(-λt)\nwhere λ is the decay constant, a value specific to the type of atom.\n\nThe probability that the atom decays within a time *t* is therefore:\nP(decay ≤ t) = 1 - e^(-λt)\n\n**2. Calculate the Decay Constant (λ)**\n\nWe are given that the probability of the atom decaying within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\nP(decay ≤ 100 min) = 0.32\n\nUsing the formula from Step 1:\n1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for the survival probability part:\ne^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32\ne^(-λ * 100) = 0.68\n\nThis equation relates the decay constant λ to the given experimental data. We don't need to calculate λ explicitly; we can use this relationship directly.\n\n**3. Apply the Memoryless Property**\n\nThe problem states that 50 minutes have passed, and the atom has not yet decayed. We are asked for the probability of it decaying in the *next* 150 minutes.\n\nBecause radioactive decay is a memoryless process, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes does not change its future decay probability. The atom doesn't \"age\" or get \"tired\". Its probability of decaying in any given future time interval remains the same, regardless of its past history.\n\nTherefore, the question simplifies to: \"What is the probability that a newly observed atom of this type will decay within 150 minutes?\"\n\n**4. Calculate the Required Probability**\n\nWe want to find the probability of decay within a 150-minute interval.\nP(decay ≤ 150 min) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\n\nWe can rewrite the exponential term using the relationship we found in Step 2:\ne^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5\n\nNow, substitute the value from Step 2 (e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68):\ne^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5\n\nFinally, calculate the probability:\nP(decay ≤ 150 min) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5\n\nLet's compute the numerical value.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# We want to calculate 1 - (0.68)^1.5\nprobability = 1 - math.pow(0.68, 1.5)\n# Convert to percentage\npercentage_probability = probability * 100\n\nprint(f\"{percentage_probability:.2f}%\")\n```\nThe calculation yields approximately 43.93%.\n\n**5.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for solving the problem:\n\n**1. Define the Physics Principle**\n\nRadioactive decay is a random process. The probability that an atom has *not* decayed after a time *t* is given by the survival function, which follows an exponential law:\nP(survival > t) = e^(-λt)\n\nHere, *P* is the probability, *t* is the time, and *λ* (lambda) is the decay constant, which is a characteristic of the specific atomic nucleus.\n\nThe probability that the atom *has* decayed by time *t* is therefore:\nP(decay ≤ t) = 1 - P(survival > t) = 1 - e^(-λt)\n\n**2. Use the Given Data to Find the Decay Constant (λ)**\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32). We can plug this into our formula:\nP(decay ≤ 100) = 0.32\n1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32\n\nRearranging the equation, we can find the value of the survival probability term:\ne^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32\ne^(-λ * 100) = 0.68\n\nThis equation gives us a way to characterize the atom's decay without needing to find the exact numerical value of λ.\n\n**3. Apply the \"Memoryless\" Property**\n\nA key feature of exponential decay is that it is a \"memoryless\" process. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed. The atom does not \"get old.\" The fact that it has already survived for 50 minutes does not change its intrinsic probability of decaying in the next instant.\n\nTherefore, the question \"What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes, given it has survived for 50 minutes?\" simplifies to \"What is the probability a newly formed atom of this type will decay within 150 minutes?\".\n\n**4. Calculate the Required Probability**\n\nWe need to calculate the probability of decay within a 150-minute interval:\nP(decay ≤ 150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\n\nWe can use a mathematical trick to solve this using the value we found in Step 2. We can rewrite e^(-λ * 150) as:\ne^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5\n\nNow, substitute the value e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68:\ne^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5\n\nFinally, calculate the probability of decay:\nP(decay ≤ 150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5\n\nLet's compute the value.\n(0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607\nProbability = 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393\n\n**5. Convert to Percentage and Choose the Answer**\n\nThe calculated probability is approximately 0.4393, which is 43.93%.\nComparing this to the options:\nA) 52%\nB) 40%\nC) 44%\nD) 48%\n\nThe value 43.93% is closest to 44%.\n\n<<<C>>>"
