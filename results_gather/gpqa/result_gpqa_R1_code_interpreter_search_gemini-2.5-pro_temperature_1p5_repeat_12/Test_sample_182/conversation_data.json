    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the reactant's structure and molecular formula.**\n    The reactant is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's break down the name to draw the structure and find its formula.\n    *   **Parent structure**: `cyclohex-3-ene`: A six-membered ring with a double bond between carbon 3 and carbon 4.\n    *   **Principal functional group**: `-carboxylic acid` at position 1. This is a -COOH group.\n    *   **Substituents**:\n        *   `2-formyl`: An aldehyde group (-CHO) at position 2.\n        *   `5-vinyl`: A vinyl group (-CH=CH2) at position 5.\n\n    The structure is as follows:\n    ```\n             COOH\n            /\n       (C1)--(C2)--CHO\n      /     \\\n    (C6)     (C3)\n     \\       //\n      (C5)--(C4)\n      |\n      CH=CH2\n    ```\n    Now, let's determine the molecular formula (CxHyOz):\n    *   **Carbons (C)**: 6 in the ring + 1 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO + 2 in -CH=CH2 = 10 carbons. (C10)\n    *   **Hydrogens (H)**: We count the hydrogens attached to each carbon to satisfy valency.\n        *   Ring hydrogens: C1(1H), C2(1H), C3(1H), C4(1H), C5(1H), C6(2H) = 7 H\n        *   -COOH hydrogen: 1 H\n        *   -CHO hydrogen: 1 H\n        *   Vinyl group hydrogens (-CH=CH2): 3 H\n        *   Total hydrogens = 7 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12 hydrogens. (H12)\n    *   **Oxygens (O)**: 2 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO = 3 oxygens. (O3)\n    The molecular formula of the reactant is **C10H12O3**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Understand the chemical reaction.**\n    The reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess of HI** (Hydroiodic acid). This is a very strong reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce most oxygen-containing functional groups and also saturate carbon-carbon double and triple bonds.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   The aldehyde group (-CHO) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   The carbon-carbon double bond in the cyclohexene ring (-C=C-) is reduced to a single bond (-CH-CH-).\n    *   The carbon-carbon double bond in the vinyl group (-CH=CH2) is reduced to form an ethyl group (-CH2-CH3).\n    *   Crucially, stable aliphatic rings like cyclohexane are not opened by this reaction.\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the structure and formula of the product.**\n    The reaction reduces all the unsaturation and removes all oxygen atoms, but it preserves the carbon skeleton, including the ring.\n    *   The reactant has a carbon skeleton of a 6-membered ring with a 1-carbon substituent (from -COOH), another 1-carbon substituent (from -CHO), and a 2-carbon substituent (from the vinyl group).\n    *   Total carbons = 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10. The product will also have 10 carbons.\n    *   The product is a saturated hydrocarbon with one ring (a substituted cyclohexane). The general formula for a monocyclic alkane (a saturated hydrocarbon with one ring) is **CnH2n**.\n    *   Since the product has 10 carbon atoms (n=10), its molecular formula will be **C10H(2*10) = C10H20**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product.**\n    The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (also known as the degree of unsaturation) tells you the sum of the number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule. The formula for a hydrocarbon CxHy is:\n    IHD = C - (H/2) + 1\n    For the product with the formula C10H20:\n    *   C = 10\n    *   H = 20\n    IHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1\n    IHD = 10 - 10 + 1\n    IHD = 1\n\n    An IHD of 1 corresponds to the single ring present in the product molecule (a substituted cyclohexane).\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the final product is 1."
