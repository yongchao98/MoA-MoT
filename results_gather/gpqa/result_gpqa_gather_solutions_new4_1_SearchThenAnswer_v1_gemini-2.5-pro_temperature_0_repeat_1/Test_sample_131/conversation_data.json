There are also three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio. Which two compounds are present in the mixture from the following options: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\nA) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\nB) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\nC) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene\nD) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nThe analysis of the 1H NMR spectrum for a 1:1 mixture of two C10H14 aromatic compounds points to a specific pair from the given options. The spectrum shows two singlets in the aromatic region (~6.7 ppm) with a 1:1 ratio, and three singlets in the aliphatic region (~2.2 ppm) with a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the expected 1H NMR signals for each potential compound:\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (durene):** Due to its high symmetry, it exhibits one singlet for its two aromatic protons and one singlet for its twelve methyl protons.\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (isodurene):** This molecule has lower symmetry, resulting in two singlets for its two distinct aromatic protons and three singlets for its methyl groups in a 6H:3H:3H (or 2:1:1) ratio.\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (prehnitene):** Symmetry dictates one singlet for the two equivalent aromatic protons and two singlets for the methyl groups in a 6H:6H (or 1:1) ratio.\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound shows one singlet for its four equivalent aromatic protons, but its ethyl groups produce a quartet and a triplet in the aliphatic region, not singlets.\n\nBased on this, 1,4-diethylbenzene is not one of the compounds in the mixture, which eliminates option D.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the remaining options for a 1:1 mixture:\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** This mixture would produce three aromatic singlets (one from the former, two from the latter), which contradicts the data.\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic region:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one singlet (2H), and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene provides another singlet (2H). In a 1:1 mixture, this results in two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. This matches the experimental data.\n    *   **Aliphatic region:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one singlet (12H), and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene gives two singlets (6H each). Combined, this gives three singlets with an integration ratio of 12H:6H:6H, which simplifies to 2:1:1. This also perfectly matches the experimental data.\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** This combination would result in three aromatic singlets, which is inconsistent with the observed spectrum.\n\nTherefore, the mixture consists of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo solve this problem, we must determine which 1:1 mixture of the given compounds produces the described 1H NMR spectrum. The molecular formula for all tetramethylbenzene isomers and 1,4-diethylbenzene is C10H14.\n\nThe experimental 1H NMR spectrum shows:\n*   **Aromatic region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nLet's analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each compound individually.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** Due to its high symmetry, all four methyl groups are chemically equivalent, and the two aromatic protons are also equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic signal:** One singlet (2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic signal:** One singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has less symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** Two distinct aromatic protons, resulting in two singlets (1H each).\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** Three sets of methyl groups: one set of two equivalent methyls (6H) and two distinct single methyl groups (3H each). This results in three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This isomer has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic signal:** Two equivalent aromatic protons, giving one singlet (2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** Two sets of two equivalent methyl groups, resulting in two singlets (6H each) with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n\n*   **1,4-Diethylbenzene:** This compound has a high degree of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic signal:** Four equivalent aromatic protons, giving one singlet (4H).\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** The ethyl groups will produce a quartet (4H, for the CH2) and a triplet (6H, for the CH3), not singlets. This option can be immediately ruled out.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the mixtures proposed in the options:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** This mixture would show three aromatic singlets (one 2H signal from 1,2,4,5- and two 1H signals from 1,2,3,5-), which contradicts the data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** This mixture would also result in three aromatic singlets (one 2H signal from 1,2,3,4- and two 1H signals from 1,2,3,5-), which is inconsistent with the observed spectrum.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** This is incorrect because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one 2H singlet, and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, these two singlets from different compounds would appear as two signals of equal integration (1:1 ratio), matching the experimental data.\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene gives two singlets (6H each). The combination in the mixture would result in three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. This corresponds to a 2:1:1 ratio, which also matches the experimental data.\n\nTherefore, the mixture contains 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Analyze the given NMR data:**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** 1:1\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   Since the mixture is 1:1, the total number of aromatic protons from each compound must be equal. Let's say each compound contributes 'x' aromatic protons. The total aromatic integration is 2x.\n    *   The two signals having a 1:1 ratio means each signal corresponds to x protons.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   The total number of protons in C10H14 is 14. If there are 'x' aromatic protons, there must be (14-x) alkyl protons.\n    *   The total integration of the alkyl region is 2 * (14-x).\n    *   The 2:1:1 ratio corresponds to relative integrations.\n\n**2. Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each candidate compound:**\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n    *   *Summary: 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).*\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** One plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C4 and C6) are in different chemical environments. They will produce **two separate singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three sets of equivalent methyl groups: (C1, C3), (C2), and (C5). This will produce **three singlets** with an integration ratio of **6H : 3H : 3H** (which simplifies to 2:1:1).\n    *   *Summary: 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 3 alkyl singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).*\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** One plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are equivalent but are adjacent to each other. They will couple and appear as an **AB quartet (or two doublets)**, not singlets.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** Two sets of equivalent methyl groups: (C1, C4) and (C2, C3). This will produce **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H**.\n    *   *Summary: 1 aromatic AB quartet (2H total), 2 alkyl singlets (6H each).*\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four protons are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **4H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The CH2 groups will produce a **quartet (4H)**, and the CH3 groups will produce a **triplet (6H)**.\n    *   *Summary: 1 aromatic singlet (4H), 1 alkyl quartet (4H), 1 alkyl triplet (6H).*\n\n**3. Evaluate the options based on the mixture's spectrum:**\n\nThe observed spectrum has only singlets in both the aromatic and alkyl regions. This immediately eliminates any option containing **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** (which gives an AB quartet) or **1,4-diethylbenzene** (which gives a quartet and a triplet).\n\nThis leaves only option D as a possibility. Let's verify it.\n\n**Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n\nLet's predict the spectrum of a 1:1 mixture of these two compounds.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet for 2H.\n    *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes two singlets, each for 1H.\n    *   The problem states we see **two singlets in a 1:1 ratio**. This can happen if the two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene accidentally have the same chemical shift, appearing as a single peak integrating to 2H.\n    *   So, we would have:\n        *   Signal 1: Singlet from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (2H)\n        *   Signal 2: Overlapping singlets from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (1H + 1H = 2H)\n    *   This results in two singlets with a 2H:2H or 1:1 integration ratio. This matches the data.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet for 12H.\n    *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes three singlets for 6H, 3H, and 3H.\n    *   The problem states we see **three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio**.\n    *   Let's look at the total protons. In a 1:1 mixture, the total alkyl protons are 12 + (6+3+3) = 24H. A 2:1:1 ratio for 24 protons means the signals integrate to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   This can happen if:\n        *   Signal 1: The 12H singlet from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n        *   Signal 2: The 6H singlet from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n        *   Signal 3: The two 3H singlets from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene accidentally overlap to form a single peak integrating to 6H.\n    *   This results in three singlets with an integration of 12H:6H:6H, which is a 2:1:1 ratio. This also matches the data.\n\nBoth the aromatic and alkyl regions of the described spectrum are perfectly explained by a 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, assuming some plausible accidental overlaps in chemical shifts.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the given information**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** The two compounds in the mixture are isomers with the formula C10H14.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** The compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both are singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n    *   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all are singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the 1H NMR spectra of the individual candidate compounds**\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four options. We need to consider chemical equivalence due to molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 are all equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has a single plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are not equivalent. They will produce **two separate singlets**, each with an integration of 1H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyl group at C1 is unique (3H).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique (3H).\n        *   This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. However, they are adjacent to each other and will couple, producing a complex signal (an AB quartet), **not a singlet**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1/C4 are equivalent (6H), and the methyl groups at C2/C3 are equivalent (6H). This results in **two singlets** with a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four protons on the ring are all equivalent, producing **one singlet** with an integration of 4H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The CH2 protons will be a **quartet** (split by CH3), and the CH3 protons will be a **triplet** (split by CH2). The signals are **not singlets**.\n\n**Step 3: Eliminate candidates based on the NMR data**\n\nWe can use the provided spectral data as filters to rule out compounds that do not fit.\n\n*   **Filter 1: Alkyl signals are all singlets.**\n    *   1,4-diethylbenzene has a quartet and a triplet in its alkyl region. This compound is therefore **eliminated**. This rules out option A.\n\n*   **Filter 2: Aromatic signals are singlets.**\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene) has an AB quartet in its aromatic region, not singlets. This compound is therefore **eliminated**. This rules out options C and D.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the correct pair and verify the mixture's spectrum**\n\nThe only two compounds remaining after the elimination process are **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**. This corresponds to option B. Let's verify that a 1:1 mixture of these two compounds matches all the given data.\n\n*   **Mixture:** 1:1 ratio of Durene and Isodurene.\n\n*   **Analysis of the Alkyl Region:**\n    *   Durene contributes one singlet of 12H.\n    *   Isodurene contributes three singlets of 6H, 3H, and 3H.\n    *   The problem states there are three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n    *   The total number of methyl protons in the 1:1 mixture is 12H (from Durene) + 12H (from Isodurene) = 24H.\n    *   A 2:1:1 ratio for 24H corresponds to signals with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   This can be achieved if the two 3H singlets from Isodurene are accidentally degenerate (have the same chemical shift) and appear as a single 6H peak.\n    *   The three resulting signals would be:\n        1.  12H singlet (from Durene)\n        2.  6H singlet (from C2/C3 methyls of Isodurene)\n        3.  6H singlet (from the overlap of C1 and C5 methyls of Isodurene)\n    *   The integration ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This matches the data.\n\n*   **Analysis of the Aromatic Region:**\n    *   Durene contributes one singlet of 2H.\n    *   Isodurene contributes two singlets, each of 1H.\n    *   The problem states there are two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   The total number of aromatic protons is 2H (from Durene) + 2H (from Isodurene) = 4H.\n    *   A 1:1 ratio for 4H corresponds to two signals, each with an integration of 2H.\n    *   This can be achieved if the two 1H singlets from Isodurene are accidentally degenerate, appearing as a single 2H peak.\n    *   The two resulting signals would be:\n        1.  2H singlet (from Durene)\n        2.  2H singlet (from the overlap of H-4 and H-6 of Isodurene)\n    *   The integration ratio is 2:2, which simplifies to **1:1**. This matches the data.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that fits all the spectral data is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe user's question is to identify which pair of compounds from a given list corresponds to a specific 1H NMR spectrum of a 1:1 mixture.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the 1H NMR Data:**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** 1:1.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   \"Two signals\" means there are two chemically distinct types of aromatic protons in the mixture.\n    *   \"Singlets\" means these aromatic protons have no adjacent proton neighbors.\n    *   \"1:1 ratio\" means the number of protons giving rise to the first signal is equal to the number of protons giving rise to the second signal.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   \"Three signals\" means there are three chemically distinct types of alkyl protons in the mixture.\n    *   \"Singlets\" means these alkyl protons are on carbons that are not adjacent to carbons with protons (e.g., methyl groups attached to the benzene ring or a quaternary carbon).\n    *   \"2:1:1 ratio\" describes the relative number of protons for these three signals.\n\n**2. Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum of Each Candidate Compound:**\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High symmetry (two perpendicular planes).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C3 and C6 are equivalent. They have no neighbors. This gives **1 singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry. This gives **1 singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** One plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent. They have no neighbors. This gives **1 singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct types of methyl groups:\n        *   C1 and C3 methyls are equivalent (6H).\n        *   C2 methyl is unique (3H).\n        *   C5 methyl is unique (3H).\n        *   This gives **3 singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**, which is a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** One plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are adjacent and not equivalent. They would split each other, resulting in **2 doublets**. This does not match the \"two singlets\" observation. **This compound is eliminated.**\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four protons are equivalent, giving **1 singlet (4H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The ethyl groups would show splitting: a quartet for the -CH2- and a triplet for the -CH3. This does not match the \"all singlets\" observation for the alkyl region. **This compound is eliminated.**\n\n**3. Evaluate the Mixture:**\nWe have eliminated 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene. The only possible components are 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. This corresponds to option A. Let's verify if a 1:1 mixture of these two matches the data.\n\n**Mixture: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (1:1)**\n\n*   **Aromatic Signals:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet (2H).\n    *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet (2H).\n    *   The mixture will show **two singlets**. Since it's a 1:1 mixture and both signals represent 2H, their integration ratio will be **1:1**. This perfectly matches the data.\n\n*   **Alkyl Signals:**\n    *   Total alkyl protons in the 1:1 mixture = 12H (from 1,2,4,5-isomer) + 12H (from 1,2,3,5-isomer) = 24H.\n    *   The observed ratio is 2:1:1, which has a total of 2+1+1 = 4 parts.\n    *   The integration of the signals must be:\n        *   Signal 1: (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n        *   Signal 2: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n        *   Signal 3: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   Now, let's see if the compounds can produce this pattern.\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one signal of **12H**.\n        *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene provides three signals of **6H**, **3H**, and **3H**.\n    *   For the mixture to show only three signals, some must overlap. If the two 3H signals from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene are accidentally equivalent (have the same chemical shift), they will appear as a single peak with an integration of 3H + 3H = 6H.\n    *   The resulting signals in the mixture would be:\n        1.  A signal of **12H** (from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene).\n        2.  A signal of **6H** (from the C1/C3 methyls of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene).\n        3.  A signal of **6H** (from the combined C2 and C5 methyls of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene).\n    *   This gives three singlets with an integration ratio of 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the data.\n\nTherefore, the mixture contains 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Molecular Formula and NMR Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14. All four options have this molecular formula.\n*   **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar ratio of two compounds. This means that the total number of protons from each compound is equal in the sample. Since all compounds are C10H14, they each contribute 14 protons.\n*   **1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n### **2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nWe need to determine the number of signals, their multiplicity (singlet, doublet, etc.), and their integration for each potential compound. This is based on the chemical equivalence of protons, which is determined by the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule has high symmetry (two perpendicular planes of symmetry).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a single **singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as a single **singlet** with an integration of 4 x 3H = **12H**.\n    *   *Summary for Durene:* 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has one plane of symmetry passing through the methyl groups at C2 and C5.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a single **singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (related by the symmetry plane). This gives one **singlet** for **6H**.\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique. This gives one **singlet** for **3H**.\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique. This gives one **singlet** for **3H**.\n    *   *Summary for Isodurene:* 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 3 aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has one plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are equivalent. Although adjacent, they form an AA' system which appears as a **singlet**. Integration is **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent.

They will appear as a single **singlet** with an integration of **4H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The problem states the aliphatic signals are all singlets. This compound has ethyl groups, which will show splitting (a quartet for the -CH2- and a triplet for the -CH3). Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated immediately**. This rules out option A.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we combine the predicted spectra for the remaining options in a 1:1 ratio and see which one matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **Option A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   Eliminated because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not give all singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\n*   **Option B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives a 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives a 2H singlet. A 1:1 mixture will show **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets. The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This matches the data.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This option is a perfect match for all the provided NMR data.\n\n*   **Option C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Both give a 2H singlet, so the 1:1 ratio is met.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The mixture would show a total of **four aliphatic singlets**, which contradicts the data (three signals).\n\n*   **Option D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Both give a 2H singlet, so the 1:1 ratio is met.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The mixture would show at least **four aliphatic singlets** (assuming one of the 6H signals overlaps). This contradicts the data (three signals).\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1.

Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nLet's analyze the structure and predict the 1H NMR signals for each of the four options. The key factors are chemical equivalence (determined by symmetry) and spin-spin coupling (n+1 rule for simple cases).\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent.

They have no adjacent protons.\n        *   **Prediction:** One singlet, integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups.\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (a pair).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique.\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique.\n        *   **Prediction:** Three singlets with an integration ratio of 6H (for C1/C3) : 3H (for C2) : 3H (for C5), which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. However, they are adjacent to each other and will couple.\n        *   **Prediction:** A multiplet (specifically, an AB quartet), **not a singlet**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups.\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent.\n        *   The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent.\n        *   **Prediction:** Two singlets with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which is 1:1.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical, similar to durene.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four protons on the ring are all chemically equivalent.\n        *   **Prediction:** One singlet, integrating to 4H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The signals are from the two equivalent ethyl groups.\n        *   The two -CH2- groups are equivalent and are split by the adjacent -CH3 groups. Prediction: One quartet (4H).\n        *   The two -CH3 groups are equivalent and are split by the adjacent -CH2- groups. Prediction: One triplet (6H).\n        *   The aliphatic spectrum consists of a quartet and a triplet, **not singlets**.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Options Based on the NMR Data**\n\nNow, let's see which 1:1 mixture of compounds matches the observed spectrum.\n\n**Aromatic Region Analysis:**\nThe spectrum shows **two singlets** in a **1:1 ratio**.\n*   This immediately rules out any option containing **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**, as it does not produce an aromatic singlet. Therefore, options **C** and **D** are incorrect.\n*   This also rules out any combination that doesn't produce a 1:1 ratio. Let's check the remaining options:\n    *   **Option A (1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB):** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives a 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives a 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in two singlets with an integration ratio of 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This matches the data.\n    *   **Option B (1,2,3,5-TMB + 1,4-diethylbenzene):** 1,2,3,5-TMB gives a 2H singlet. 1,4-diethylbenzene gives a 4H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in two singlets with an integration ratio of 2H:4H, which is **1:2**. This does not match the data.\n\nBased on the aromatic region alone, **Option A** is the only possibility.\n\n**Aliphatic Region Analysis (Confirmation):**\nLet's confirm that Option A also matches the aliphatic data: **three singlets** in a **2:1:1 ratio**.\n*   **Mixture:** 1:1 ratio of 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB.\n*   **Total Aliphatic Protons:** 12H (from 1,2,4,5-TMB) + 12H (from 1,2,3,5-TMB) = 24H.\n*   **Expected Signal Integrals:** A 2:1:1 ratio for a total of 24H means the three signals must integrate to:\n    *   Signal 1: (2 / (2+1+1)) * 24H = 12H\n    *   Signal 2: (1 / (2+1+1)) * 24H = 6H\n    *   Signal 3: (1 / (2+1+1)) * 24H = 6H\n*   **Signals from Individual Compounds:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB provides one singlet of **12H**.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB provides three singlets of **6H**, **3H**, and **3H**.\n*   **Combining the Signals:** To get the observed spectrum (three signals of 12H, 6H, 6H), the following must occur:\n    1.  The 12H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB is one of the observed signals.\n    2.  The 6H singlet from 1,2,3,5-TMB is the second observed signal.\n    3.  The two 3H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB must have the same chemical shift (a phenomenon called accidental isochrony), thus appearing as a single combined signal integrating to 3H + 3H = **6H**. This is the third observed signal.\n\nThis combination perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that fits all the spectral data is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nMy plan is to analyze the predicted NMR spectra for each compound and then evaluate each multiple-choice option by combining the spectra for a 1:1 mixture. I will compare these combined spectra to the experimental data to find the correct match.\n\n**Experimental Data:**\n*   Aromatic region (~6.7 ppm): 2 singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   Aliphatic region (~2.2 ppm): 3 singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n**Analysis of Options based on the predicted spectra:**\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic signals: 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. Total = **3 aromatic signals**. This does not match the experimental data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic signals: 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. Total = **3 aromatic signals**. This does not match the experimental data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. In a mixture, this results in **2 singlets**. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 ratio and each signal corresponds to 2 protons, the integration ratio is **1:1**. This **matches** the aromatic data.\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet for 12H. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets, each for 6H. In a mixture, this results in **3 singlets**. The integration ratio is 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This **matches** the aliphatic data.\n    *   This option is a perfect match.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aliphatic signals: 1,4-diethylbenzene would produce a quartet and a triplet, not singlets. This does not match the experimental data.\n\nThe only combination that matches the observed NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThe analysis of the 1H NMR spectrum of the mixture and the individual components leads to the identification of the two compounds present. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n### Analysis of the Provided 1H NMR Data\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds. All options—1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,4-diethylbenzene—fit this formula.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this indicates that each compound has only one type of aromatic proton. A singlet means that all aromatic protons within a single molecule are chemically equivalent due to symmetry.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum displays three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. The presence of singlets suggests the signals come from methyl (-CH3) groups, as ethyl groups would produce a more complex pattern (a quartet and a triplet). This allows for the exclusion of 1,4-diethylbenzene, which has ethyl groups. This eliminates option D.\n\n### Predicted 1H NMR Spectra for Each Isomer\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent. This results in **one singlet** (2H).\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** The four methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 are equivalent. This results in **one singlet** (12H).\n\n2.  **1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry exists.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. This gives **one singlet** (2H).\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent, and the methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent. This produces **two singlets** with a 6H:6H or 1:1 integration ratio.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry exists.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent, yielding **one singlet** (2H).\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1 and C3, the unique one at C2, and the unique one at C5. This leads to **three singlets** with a 6H:3H:3H or 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n### Evaluating the Mixture Options\n\nThe mixture's spectrum has two aromatic singlets and three alkyl singlets.\n\n*   **Option A (1,2,3,4- and 1,2,3,5-):** This mixture would produce five alkyl singlets (two from 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and three from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene), which contradicts the data.\n*   **Option B (1,2,4,5- and 1,2,3,4-):**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Both compounds give one singlet each, resulting in two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. This matches the data.\n    *   **Alkyl:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one singlet (relative integral 12H). 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene gives two singlets (each with a relative integral of 6H). The combination gives three singlets with an intensity ratio of 12H:6H:6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches the observed spectrum.\n*   **Option C (1,2,4,5- and 1,2,3,5-):** This mixture would result in four alkyl singlets (one from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and three from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene), which is inconsistent with the data.\n\nTherefore, the mixture must contain 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThe analysis of the problem and the initial reasoning appear to be correct. The search results confirm the expected NMR patterns for the compounds in question.\n\nHere is a summary of the analysis:\n\n### **1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:** Two singlets around 6.7 ppm with a 1:1 integration ratio. This means the two compounds in the 1:1 mixture must each contribute an equal number of protons to two different singlet signals. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio, each compound must have a singlet in the aromatic region, and the number of protons represented by each singlet must be the same.\n*   **Aliphatic Region:** Three singlets around 2.2 ppm with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. These signals come from the methyl groups.\n\n### **2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Option**\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   *Symmetry:* High symmetry.\n    *   *Aromatic Protons:* Two equivalent protons at positions 3 and 6.

This will produce **two singlets** (1H each).\n    *   *Aliphatic Protons:* Three sets of methyl groups (C1/C3 are equivalent, C2 is unique, C5 is unique). This will produce **three singlets** in a 6H:3H:3H ratio (or 2:1:1).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   *Symmetry:* A plane of symmetry.\n    *   *Aromatic Protons:* Two equivalent protons at positions 5 and 6. This will produce **one singlet** (2H).\n    *   *Aliphatic Protons:* Two sets of equivalent methyl groups (C1/C4 and C2/C3). This will produce **two singlets** in a 6H:6H ratio (or 1:1).\n    *   *Chemical Shifts:* Aromatic protons at ~6.88 ppm and methyl protons at ~2.17 ppm and ~2.24 ppm.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   *Symmetry:* High symmetry.\n    *   *Aromatic Protons:* Four equivalent protons. This will produce **one singlet** (4H).\n    *   *Aliphatic Protons:* The ethyl groups will show coupling. A quartet for the -CH2- group and a triplet for the -CH3 group. This does not match the \"all singlets\" description for the aliphatic region.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Mixtures**\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** This mixture would show three aromatic singlets (one 2H signal and two 1H signals), which contradicts the data.\n*   **B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** This is incorrect because 1,4-diethylbenzene would show a quartet and a triplet, not just singlets, in the aliphatic region.\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** This mixture would show three aromatic singlets (one 2H signal and two 1H signals), which contradicts the data.\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets** with a **1:1 integration ratio** (2H:2H). This perfectly matches the experimental data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene gives two 6H singlets.

It has three sets of methyl groups (C1, C3, and the C2/C5 pair), resulting in three aliphatic singlets with a 1:1:2 ratio of protons.\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** The spectrum for this compound would show a singlet for the four equivalent aromatic protons.

This applies to 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene (C6H4(CH2CH3)2):** 6 carbons in the ring + (2 * 2) carbons in ethyl groups = 10 carbons. 4 hydrogens on the ring + (2 * 5) hydrogens in ethyl groups = 14 hydrogens. The formula is C10H14.\nAll four options are isomers with the correct molecular formula.\n\n**Step 3: Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each individual compound**\n\nWe need to analyze the symmetry of each molecule to predict the number of signals, their multiplicity, and their integration.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C3 and C6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (no adjacent protons) with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **12H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has a single plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        1.  The methyls at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  The methyl at C2 is unique (3H).\n        3.  The methyl at C5 is unique (3H).\n        This will result in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a single plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        1.  The methyls at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  The methyls at C2 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        This will result in **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which simplifies to 1:1.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four protons on the ring are all equivalent, producing **one singlet** with an integration of **4H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The CH2 protons will be split by the CH3 protons, and vice-versa.\n        1.  A **quartet** for the CH2 groups (4H).\n        2.  A **triplet** for the CH3 groups (6H).\n    *   **Careful Point:** The problem states that all signals in the alkyl region are singlets. Since 1,4-diethylbenzene shows a quartet and a triplet, any option containing it (Option A) can be immediately eliminated.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the spectrum of the 1:1 mixture**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture of two of the three tetramethylbenzene isomers that matches the given spectrum.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region Analysis:** All three tetramethylbenzene isomers show one aromatic singlet for 2H. A 1:1 mixture of any two of them will have two different types of aromatic protons, each contributing 2H. This will result in two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio (2H:2H). This part of the data is consistent with any pair of the three tetramethylbenzene isomers.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region Analysis (The Deciding Factor):**\n    *   The mixture has three singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio.\n    *   In a 1:1 mixture, the total number of alkyl (methyl) protons is 12H (from the first compound) + 12H (from the second compound) = 24H.\n    *   Let's find the absolute integration of the signals. If the ratio is 2:1:1, the total integration can be represented as 2x + 1x + 1x = 4x.\n    *   Since 4x = 24H, then x = 6H.\n    *   Therefore, the three singlets in the mixture must have integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n\n**Step 5: Test the remaining combinations**\n\nWe need to find a pair of compounds whose individual alkyl signals combine to give three signals with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene) + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   Prehnitene signals: one 6H singlet, another 6H singlet.\n    *   Isodurene signals: one 6H singlet, one 3H singlet, another 3H singlet.\n    *   Combined: We would have signals of (6H, 6H, 6H, 3H, 3H). This cannot be combined to form signals of 12H, 6H, and 6H. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   Durene signal: one 12H singlet.\n    *   Isodurene signals: one 6H singlet, one 3H singlet, another 3H singlet.\n    *   Combined: We would have four signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H). This does not match the observation of three signals unless two signals accidentally overlap.\n\n*   **Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) + 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   Durene signal: **one 12H singlet**.\n    *   Prehnitene signals: **one 6H singlet** and **another 6H singlet**.\n    *   Combined: This combination directly gives **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n    *   The ratio of these integrations is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   This combination perfectly matches all the data provided in the problem without requiring any assumptions of accidental signal overlap.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe mixture consists of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo solve this, we must analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each compound and then see which 1:1 mixture matches the provided spectral data.\n\n**Analysis of Each Compound's 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** Due to its high symmetry, all four methyl groups are chemically equivalent, and the two aromatic protons are also equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** One singlet (2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** One singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule is less symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** It has two non-equivalent aromatic protons (at positions 4 and 6), which do not have adjacent protons to couple with. This results in two separate singlets (1H each).\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** It has four non-equivalent methyl groups. This would typically produce four singlets. However, accidental overlap is possible. The problem's data of three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio suggests that two of the four methyl groups are coincidentally equivalent in the spectrum, giving a 6H:3H:3H ratio.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** It has two aromatic protons at positions 5 and 6. They are chemically equivalent to each other but are adjacent, which should result in a coupled system (a doublet or multiplet). However, for highly symmetric molecules, this can sometimes appear as a singlet. Spectral data confirms one aromatic signal.\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** The four methyl groups form two equivalence sets: (the outer methyls at 1 and 4) and (the inner methyls at 2 and 3). This results in two singlets, each integrating to 6 protons.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** One singlet (4H).\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** The ethyl groups produce a quartet (for the CH2) and a triplet (for the CH3), not singlets. This compound can be immediately ruled out.\n\n**Evaluation of the Mixture Options:**\n\nThe experimental data for the 1:1 mixture is:\n*   **Aromatic region:** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic region:** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nLet's test the options:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (2H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one singlet (2H). In a 1:1 mixture, this would result in two singlets with a 2H:2H or 1:1 integration ratio. This matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H each). The combination in a 1:1 mixture would show three singlets with relative integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. This simplifies to a 2:1:1 ratio. This also matches the data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one singlet (2H). 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two singlets (1H each). This would result in a total of three aromatic signals. This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (2H). 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two singlets (1H each). This would result in a total of three aromatic signals. This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This option is incorrect because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only mixture that perfectly matches the described 1H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe Python script successfully identified the correct pair of compounds by simulating the 1H NMR spectrum for each possible mixture and comparing it to the experimental data.\n\nThe analysis proceeded as follows:\n*   **Target Spectrum:** The experimental data for the 1:1 mixture required two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio (integrating to 2H each) and three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio (integrating to 12H, 6H, and 6H).\n*   **Option A (1,2,4,5- and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene):** This mixture would produce three aromatic signals and four aliphatic signals, which is inconsistent with the data.\n*   **Option B (1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene):** This option was eliminated because 1,4-diethylbenzene would produce quartets and triplets, not just the singlets observed in the spectrum.\n*   **Option C (1,2,4,5- and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene):** This mixture perfectly matched the target.\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one 2H singlet, and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes one 2H singlet, resulting in two signals in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one 12H singlet, and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes two 6H singlets, resulting in three signals with a 12:6:6 (or 2:1:1) ratio.\n*   **Option D (1,2,3,4- and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene):** This mixture would produce three aromatic signals and five aliphatic signals (before considering accidental overlap), which is inconsistent with the data.\n\nThe script correctly concluded that only the mixture in Option C is consistent with the provided NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nThe search results confirm the initial analysis of the expected NMR spectra for the compounds.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** The spectrum shows two signals. One for the two equivalent aromatic protons (around 6.89 ppm) and one for the four equivalent methyl groups (around 2.18 ppm). This confirms one aromatic singlet and one aliphatic singlet.\n*   **1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** The data shows signals at ~6.88 ppm (aromatic) and ~2.17/2.24 ppm (aliphatic). Critically, the two aromatic protons are adjacent (at C5 and C6) and would form an AB quartet (or two doublets), not a singlet. This makes any option with this compound incorrect.\n*   **1,4-Diethylbenzene:** The spectrum would show a singlet for the four equivalent aromatic protons, but a quartet and a triplet for the ethyl groups, not singlets. This rules out any option with this compound.\n*   **1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** The molecule has a plane of symmetry, making the two aromatic protons (at C4 and C6) equivalent and isolated, resulting in one aromatic singlet. It has three distinct sets of methyl groups: Me at C2, Me at C5, and the equivalent pair at C1/C3. This should result in three aliphatic singlets with an integration ratio of 3H:3H:6H, which simplifies to 1:1:2.\n\nNow, let's re-evaluate the mixture based on this confirmed information.\n\n**Mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Option B):**\n\n1.  **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one 2H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one 2H singlet.\n    *   In a 1:1 mixture, this results in two singlets of equal integration (1:1 ratio), which perfectly matches the problem description.\n\n2.  **Aliphatic Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one 12H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene provides three singlets with integrations of 6H, 3H, and 3H.\n    *   The problem states that the mixture shows **three** singlets in a **2:1:1 ratio**.\n    *   The total number of aliphatic protons in the 1:1 mixture is 12 (from durene) + 12 (from isodurene) = 24 protons.\n    *   A 2:1:1 ratio for 24 protons means the signals must have integrations of:\n        *   (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n        *   (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n        *   (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   Let's see if we can form this pattern from the signals of the two compounds:\n        *   The 12H singlet from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene accounts for the 12H signal (the \"2\" part of the ratio).\n        *   The 6H singlet from the C1/C3 methyls of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene accounts for one of the 6H signals (one \"1\" part of the ratio).\n        *   The remaining two 3H singlets (from C2 and C5 methyls of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene) must be overlapping (accidentally isochronous) to form the third signal, which would have an integration of 3H + 3H = 6H (the other \"1\" part of the ratio).\n\nThis scenario is the only one that fits all the data provided in the question. The other options are ruled out because they do not produce two aromatic singlets.\n\nFinal check:\n- Option A is wrong because 1,2,3,4-TMB gives an aromatic doublet/quartet.\n- Option C is wrong because the aromatic signals would be in a 1:2 ratio, and 1,4-diethylbenzene gives a quartet/triplet in the aliphatic region.\n- Option D is wrong because 1,2,3,4-TMB gives an aromatic doublet/quartet.\n\nTherefore, the mixture must contain 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds:\n\n### **1. Analyze the Provided 1H NMR Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14. All four options satisfy this.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. This indicates two distinct types of aromatic protons in the mixture, and the total number of protons for each type is equal. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar mixture, this could mean each compound provides one type of aromatic proton and has the same number of them, or some other combination that results in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. This indicates three distinct types of alkyl protons, all of which are singlets (implying no adjacent protons, characteristic of methyl groups not adjacent to other protons).\n\n### **2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Compound**\n\nLet's analyze the expected signals for each of the four possible compounds based on their molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has lower symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. They should produce **two distinct singlets**, each integrating to 1H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are in three distinct chemical environments: Me(1) and Me(3) are equivalent, Me(2) is unique, and Me(5) is unique. This would result in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry makes pairs of groups equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent to each other. However, they are adjacent (ortho), so they will couple and appear as a **pair of doublets**, not a singlet. This contradicts the problem description. However, for the sake of thoroughness, let's note it would be one signal area integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at positions 1 and 4 are equivalent, and the methyl groups at positions 2 and 3 are equivalent. This will produce **two singlets**, each integrating to 6H (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are all chemically equivalent and will produce **one singlet** integrating to 4H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The signal for the -CH2- protons will be a **quartet**, and the signal for the -CH3 protons will be a **triplet**. This contradicts the problem's description of only singlets in the alkyl region.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Options**\n\nBased on the individual spectra, we can immediately rule out **1,4-diethylbenzene** because it would show triplets and quartets, not just singlets, in the alkyl region. We can also likely rule out **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** because its aromatic protons would produce doublets, not the singlets described in the problem.\n\nThis leaves **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene** as the most likely candidates (Option A). Let's test this combination.\n\n*   **Mixture A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene gives two 1H singlets. This would result in a total of **three** aromatic signals, which contradicts the data. Even if two signals overlapped, the integration ratios would not be 1:1.\n\nThere seems to be a contradiction. Let's reconsider the alkyl region, which is more complex and thus more informative. The required ratio is **2:1:1**.\n\nLet's re-examine the mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** (Option D), and assume the term \"singlet\" for the aromatic region of 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene was a simplification in the problem statement.\n\n*   **Mixture D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one signal for 2H.\n        *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene provides one signal for 2H.\n        *   This results in two signals with an integration ratio of 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This matches the aromatic data.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides **one singlet** for **12H**.\n        *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene provides **two singlets**, each for **6H**.\n        *   In the mixture, we would see three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n        *   The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches the alkyl data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only one that produces the observed integration ratios in both the aromatic (1:1) and alkyl (2:1:1) regions.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nTo evaluate the mixtures, we must first understand the spectrum of each component. This depends on the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** This compound has ethyl groups, which produce a quartet (-CH2-) and a triplet (-CH3-) due to spin-spin coupling.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets, **1,4-diethylbenzene is eliminated**. This immediately rules out option C.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent and have no adjacent protons. This gives **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent. This gives **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are equivalent. In many contexts, this AA' system appears as a single sharp signal. We will treat it as **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: the outer pair (C1, C4) and the inner pair (C2, C3). This gives **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has no plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C4 and C6) are in different chemical environments.

Prehnitene provides one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This perfectly matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** Durene provides one 12H singlet. Prehnitene provides two 6H singlets. The mixture therefore shows **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**.

Which two compounds are present in the mixture from the following options: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\nA) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\nB) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\nC) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene\nD) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nThe analysis of the 1H NMR spectrum for a 1:1 mixture of two C10H14 aromatic compounds points to a specific pair from the given options. The spectrum shows two singlets in the aromatic region (~6.7 ppm) with a 1:1 ratio, and three singlets in the aliphatic region (~2.2 ppm) with a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the expected 1H NMR signals for each potential compound:\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (durene):** Due to its high symmetry, it exhibits one singlet for its two aromatic protons and one singlet for its twelve methyl protons.\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (isodurene):** This molecule has lower symmetry, resulting in two singlets for its two distinct aromatic protons and three singlets for its methyl groups in a 6H:3H:3H (or 2:1:1) ratio.\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (prehnitene):** Symmetry dictates one singlet for the two equivalent aromatic protons and two singlets for the methyl groups in a 6H:6H (or 1:1) ratio.\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound shows one singlet for its four equivalent aromatic protons, but its ethyl groups produce a quartet and a triplet in the aliphatic region, not singlets.\n\nBased on this, 1,4-diethylbenzene is not one of the compounds in the mixture, which eliminates option D.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the remaining options for a 1:1 mixture:\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** This mixture would produce three aromatic singlets (one from the former, two from the latter), which contradicts the data.\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic region:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one singlet (2H), and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene provides another singlet (2H). In a 1:1 mixture, this results in two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. This matches the experimental data.\n    *   **Aliphatic region:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one singlet (12H), and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene gives two singlets (6H each). Combined, this gives three singlets with an integration ratio of 12H:6H:6H, which simplifies to 2:1:1. This also perfectly matches the experimental data.\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** This combination would result in three aromatic singlets, which is inconsistent with the observed spectrum.\n\nTherefore, the mixture consists of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo solve this problem, we must determine which 1:1 mixture of the given compounds produces the described 1H NMR spectrum. The molecular formula for all tetramethylbenzene isomers and 1,4-diethylbenzene is C10H14.\n\nThe experimental 1H NMR spectrum shows:\n*   **Aromatic region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nLet's analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each compound individually.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** Due to its high symmetry, all four methyl groups are chemically equivalent, and the two aromatic protons are also equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic signal:** One singlet (2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic signal:** One singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has less symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** Two distinct aromatic protons, resulting in two singlets (1H each).\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** Three sets of methyl groups: one set of two equivalent methyls (6H) and two distinct single methyl groups (3H each). This results in three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This isomer has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic signal:** Two equivalent aromatic protons, giving one singlet (2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** Two sets of two equivalent methyl groups, resulting in two singlets (6H each) with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n\n*   **1,4-Diethylbenzene:** This compound has a high degree of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic signal:** Four equivalent aromatic protons, giving one singlet (4H).\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** The ethyl groups will produce a quartet (4H, for the CH2) and a triplet (6H, for the CH3), not singlets. This option can be immediately ruled out.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the mixtures proposed in the options:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** This mixture would show three aromatic singlets (one 2H signal from 1,2,4,5- and two 1H signals from 1,2,3,5-), which contradicts the data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** This mixture would also result in three aromatic singlets (one 2H signal from 1,2,3,4- and two 1H signals from 1,2,3,5-), which is inconsistent with the observed spectrum.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** This is incorrect because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one 2H singlet, and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, these two singlets from different compounds would appear as two signals of equal integration (1:1 ratio), matching the experimental data.\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene gives two singlets (6H each). The combination in the mixture would result in three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. This corresponds to a 2:1:1 ratio, which also matches the experimental data.\n\nTherefore, the mixture contains 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Analyze the given NMR data:**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** 1:1\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   Since the mixture is 1:1, the total number of aromatic protons from each compound must be equal. Let's say each compound contributes 'x' aromatic protons. The total aromatic integration is 2x.\n    *   The two signals having a 1:1 ratio means each signal corresponds to x protons.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   The total number of protons in C10H14 is 14. If there are 'x' aromatic protons, there must be (14-x) alkyl protons.\n    *   The total integration of the alkyl region is 2 * (14-x).\n    *   The 2:1:1 ratio corresponds to relative integrations.\n\n**2. Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each candidate compound:**\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n    *   *Summary: 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).*\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** One plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C4 and C6) are in different chemical environments. They will produce **two separate singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three sets of equivalent methyl groups: (C1, C3), (C2), and (C5). This will produce **three singlets** with an integration ratio of **6H : 3H : 3H** (which simplifies to 2:1:1).\n    *   *Summary: 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 3 alkyl singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).*\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** One plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are equivalent but are adjacent to each other. They will couple and appear as an **AB quartet (or two doublets)**, not singlets.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** Two sets of equivalent methyl groups: (C1, C4) and (C2, C3). This will produce **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H**.\n    *   *Summary: 1 aromatic AB quartet (2H total), 2 alkyl singlets (6H each).*\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four protons are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **4H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The CH2 groups will produce a **quartet (4H)**, and the CH3 groups will produce a **triplet (6H)**.\n    *   *Summary: 1 aromatic singlet (4H), 1 alkyl quartet (4H), 1 alkyl triplet (6H).*\n\n**3. Evaluate the options based on the mixture's spectrum:**\n\nThe observed spectrum has only singlets in both the aromatic and alkyl regions. This immediately eliminates any option containing **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** (which gives an AB quartet) or **1,4-diethylbenzene** (which gives a quartet and a triplet).\n\nThis leaves only option D as a possibility. Let's verify it.\n\n**Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n\nLet's predict the spectrum of a 1:1 mixture of these two compounds.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet for 2H.\n    *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes two singlets, each for 1H.\n    *   The problem states we see **two singlets in a 1:1 ratio**. This can happen if the two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene accidentally have the same chemical shift, appearing as a single peak integrating to 2H.\n    *   So, we would have:\n        *   Signal 1: Singlet from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (2H)\n        *   Signal 2: Overlapping singlets from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (1H + 1H = 2H)\n    *   This results in two singlets with a 2H:2H or 1:1 integration ratio. This matches the data.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet for 12H.\n    *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes three singlets for 6H, 3H, and 3H.\n    *   The problem states we see **three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio**.\n    *   Let's look at the total protons. In a 1:1 mixture, the total alkyl protons are 12 + (6+3+3) = 24H. A 2:1:1 ratio for 24 protons means the signals integrate to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   This can happen if:\n        *   Signal 1: The 12H singlet from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n        *   Signal 2: The 6H singlet from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n        *   Signal 3: The two 3H singlets from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene accidentally overlap to form a single peak integrating to 6H.\n    *   This results in three singlets with an integration of 12H:6H:6H, which is a 2:1:1 ratio. This also matches the data.\n\nBoth the aromatic and alkyl regions of the described spectrum are perfectly explained by a 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, assuming some plausible accidental overlaps in chemical shifts.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the given information**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** The two compounds in the mixture are isomers with the formula C10H14.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** The compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both are singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n    *   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all are singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the 1H NMR spectra of the individual candidate compounds**\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four options. We need to consider chemical equivalence due to molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent.

However, they are adjacent to each other and will couple, producing a complex signal (an AB quartet), **not a singlet**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1/C4 are equivalent (6H), and the methyl groups at C2/C3 are equivalent (6H). This results in **two singlets** with a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four protons on the ring are all equivalent, producing **one singlet** with an integration of 4H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The CH2 protons will be a **quartet** (split by CH3), and the CH3 protons will be a **triplet** (split by CH2). The signals are **not singlets**.\n\n**Step 3: Eliminate candidates based on the NMR data**\n\nWe can use the provided spectral data as filters to rule out compounds that do not fit.\n\n*   **Filter 1: Alkyl signals are all singlets.**\n    *   1,4-diethylbenzene has a quartet and a triplet in its alkyl region. This compound is therefore **eliminated**. This rules out option A.\n\n*   **Filter 2: Aromatic signals are singlets.**\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene) has an AB quartet in its aromatic region, not singlets. This compound is therefore **eliminated**. This rules out options C and D.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the correct pair and verify the mixture's spectrum**\n\nThe only two compounds remaining after the elimination process are **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**. This corresponds to option B. Let's verify that a 1:1 mixture of these two compounds matches all the given data.\n\n*   **Mixture:** 1:1 ratio of Durene and Isodurene.\n\n*   **Analysis of the Alkyl Region:**\n    *   Durene contributes one singlet of 12H.\n    *   Isodurene contributes three singlets of 6H, 3H, and 3H.\n    *   The problem states there are three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n    *   The total number of methyl protons in the 1:1 mixture is 12H (from Durene) + 12H (from Isodurene) = 24H.\n    *   A 2:1:1 ratio for 24H corresponds to signals with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   This can be achieved if the two 3H singlets from Isodurene are accidentally degenerate (have the same chemical shift) and appear as a single 6H peak.\n    *   The three resulting signals would be:\n        1.  12H singlet (from Durene)\n        2.  6H singlet (from C2/C3 methyls of Isodurene)\n        3.  6H singlet (from the overlap of C1 and C5 methyls of Isodurene)\n    *   The integration ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.

Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum of Each Candidate Compound:**\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High symmetry (two perpendicular planes).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C3 and C6 are equivalent. They have no neighbors. This gives **1 singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry.

This does not match the \"all singlets\" observation for the alkyl region. **This compound is eliminated.**\n\n**3. Evaluate the Mixture:**\nWe have eliminated 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene. The only possible components are 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. This corresponds to option A. Let's verify if a 1:1 mixture of these two matches the data.\n\n**Mixture: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (1:1)**\n\n*   **Aromatic Signals:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet (2H).\n    *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet (2H).\n    *   The mixture will show **two singlets**. Since it's a 1:1 mixture and both signals represent 2H, their integration ratio will be **1:1**. This perfectly matches the data.\n\n*   **Alkyl Signals:**\n    *   Total alkyl protons in the 1:1 mixture = 12H (from 1,2,4,5-isomer) + 12H (from 1,2,3,5-isomer) = 24H.\n    *   The observed ratio is 2:1:1, which has a total of 2+1+1 = 4 parts.\n    *   The integration of the signals must be:\n        *   Signal 1: (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n        *   Signal 2: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n        *   Signal 3: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   Now, let's see if the compounds can produce this pattern.\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one signal of **12H**.\n        *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene provides three signals of **6H**, **3H**, and **3H**.\n    *   For the mixture to show only three signals, some must overlap.

A signal of **12H** (from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene).\n        2.  A signal of **6H** (from the C1/C3 methyls of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene).\n        3.  A signal of **6H** (from the combined C2 and C5 methyls of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene).\n    *   This gives three singlets with an integration ratio of 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the data.\n\nTherefore, the mixture contains 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Molecular Formula and NMR Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14. All four options have this molecular formula.\n*   **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar ratio of two compounds. This means that the total number of protons from each compound is equal in the sample. Since all compounds are C10H14, they each contribute 14 protons.\n*   **1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n### **2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nWe need to determine the number of signals, their multiplicity (singlet, doublet, etc.), and their integration for each potential compound. This is based on the chemical equivalence of protons, which is determined by the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule has high symmetry (two perpendicular planes of symmetry).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a single **singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as a single **singlet** with an integration of 4 x 3H = **12H**.\n    *   *Summary for Durene:* 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has one plane of symmetry passing through the methyl groups at C2 and C5.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a single **singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (related by the symmetry plane). This gives one **singlet** for **6H**.\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique. This gives one **singlet** for **3H**.\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique. This gives one **singlet** for **3H**.\n    *   *Summary for Isodurene:* 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 3 aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has one plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are equivalent. Although adjacent, they form an AA' system which appears as a **singlet**. Integration is **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent.

They will appear as a single **singlet** with an integration of **4H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The problem states the aliphatic signals are all singlets. This compound has ethyl groups, which will show splitting (a quartet for the -CH2- and a triplet for the -CH3). Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated immediately**. This rules out option A.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we combine the predicted spectra for the remaining options in a 1:1 ratio and see which one matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **Option A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   Eliminated because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not give all singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\n*   **Option B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives a 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives a 2H singlet. A 1:1 mixture will show **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets. The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This matches the data.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This option is a perfect match for all the provided NMR data.\n\n*   **Option C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Both give a 2H singlet, so the 1:1 ratio is met.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The mixture would show a total of **four aliphatic singlets**, which contradicts the data (three signals).\n\n*   **Option D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Both give a 2H singlet, so the 1:1 ratio is met.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The mixture would show at least **four aliphatic singlets** (assuming one of the 6H signals overlaps). This contradicts the data (three signals).\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1.

Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nLet's analyze the structure and predict the 1H NMR signals for each of the four options. The key factors are chemical equivalence (determined by symmetry) and spin-spin coupling (n+1 rule for simple cases).\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent.

They have no adjacent protons.\n        *   **Prediction:** One singlet, integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups.\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (a pair).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique.\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique.\n        *   **Prediction:** Three singlets with an integration ratio of 6H (for C1/C3) : 3H (for C2) : 3H (for C5), which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. However, they are adjacent to each other and will couple.\n        *   **Prediction:** A multiplet (specifically, an AB quartet), **not a singlet**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups.\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent.\n        *   The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent.\n        *   **Prediction:** Two singlets with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which is 1:1.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical, similar to durene.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four protons on the ring are all chemically equivalent.\n        *   **Prediction:** One singlet, integrating to 4H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The signals are from the two equivalent ethyl groups.\n        *   The two -CH2- groups are equivalent and are split by the adjacent -CH3 groups. Prediction: One quartet (4H).\n        *   The two -CH3 groups are equivalent and are split by the adjacent -CH2- groups. Prediction: One triplet (6H).\n        *   The aliphatic spectrum consists of a quartet and a triplet, **not singlets**.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Options Based on the NMR Data**\n\nNow, let's see which 1:1 mixture of compounds matches the observed spectrum.\n\n**Aromatic Region Analysis:**\nThe spectrum shows **two singlets** in a **1:1 ratio**.\n*   This immediately rules out any option containing **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**, as it does not produce an aromatic singlet. Therefore, options **C** and **D** are incorrect.\n*   This also rules out any combination that doesn't produce a 1:1 ratio. Let's check the remaining options:\n    *   **Option A (1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB):** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives a 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives a 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in two singlets with an integration ratio of 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This matches the data.\n    *   **Option B (1,2,3,5-TMB + 1,4-diethylbenzene):** 1,2,3,5-TMB gives a 2H singlet. 1,4-diethylbenzene gives a 4H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in two singlets with an integration ratio of 2H:4H, which is **1:2**. This does not match the data.\n\nBased on the aromatic region alone, **Option A** is the only possibility.\n\n**Aliphatic Region Analysis (Confirmation):**\nLet's confirm that Option A also matches the aliphatic data: **three singlets** in a **2:1:1 ratio**.\n*   **Mixture:** 1:1 ratio of 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB.\n*   **Total Aliphatic Protons:** 12H (from 1,2,4,5-TMB) + 12H (from 1,2,3,5-TMB) = 24H.\n*   **Expected Signal Integrals:** A 2:1:1 ratio for a total of 24H means the three signals must integrate to:\n    *   Signal 1: (2 / (2+1+1)) * 24H = 12H\n    *   Signal 2: (1 / (2+1+1)) * 24H = 6H\n    *   Signal 3: (1 / (2+1+1)) * 24H = 6H\n*   **Signals from Individual Compounds:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB provides one singlet of **12H**.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB provides three singlets of **6H**, **3H**, and **3H**.\n*   **Combining the Signals:** To get the observed spectrum (three signals of 12H, 6H, 6H), the following must occur:\n    1.  The 12H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB is one of the observed signals.\n    2.  The 6H singlet from 1,2,3,5-TMB is the second observed signal.\n    3.  The two 3H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB must have the same chemical shift (a phenomenon called accidental isochrony), thus appearing as a single combined signal integrating to 3H + 3H = **6H**. This is the third observed signal.\n\nThis combination perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that fits all the spectral data is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nMy plan is to analyze the predicted NMR spectra for each compound and then evaluate each multiple-choice option by combining the spectra for a 1:1 mixture. I will compare these combined spectra to the experimental data to find the correct match.\n\n**Experimental Data:**\n*   Aromatic region (~6.7 ppm): 2 singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   Aliphatic region (~2.2 ppm): 3 singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n**Analysis of Options based on the predicted spectra:**\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic signals: 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. Total = **3 aromatic signals**. This does not match the experimental data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic signals: 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. Total = **3 aromatic signals**. This does not match the experimental data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. In a mixture, this results in **2 singlets**. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 ratio and each signal corresponds to 2 protons, the integration ratio is **1:1**. This **matches** the aromatic data.\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet for 12H. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets, each for 6H. In a mixture, this results in **3 singlets**. The integration ratio is 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This **matches** the aliphatic data.\n    *   This option is a perfect match.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aliphatic signals: 1,4-diethylbenzene would produce a quartet and a triplet, not singlets. This does not match the experimental data.\n\nThe only combination that matches the observed NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThe analysis of the 1H NMR spectrum of the mixture and the individual components leads to the identification of the two compounds present. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n### Analysis of the Provided 1H NMR Data\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds. All options—1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,4-diethylbenzene—fit this formula.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this indicates that each compound has only one type of aromatic proton. A singlet means that all aromatic protons within a single molecule are chemically equivalent due to symmetry.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum displays three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. The presence of singlets suggests the signals come from methyl (-CH3) groups, as ethyl groups would produce a more complex pattern (a quartet and a triplet). This allows for the exclusion of 1,4-diethylbenzene, which has ethyl groups. This eliminates option D.\n\n### Predicted 1H NMR Spectra for Each Isomer\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent. This results in **one singlet** (2H).\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** The four methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 are equivalent. This results in **one singlet** (12H).\n\n2.  **1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry exists.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. This gives **one singlet** (2H).\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent, and the methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent. This produces **two singlets** with a 6H:6H or 1:1 integration ratio.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry exists.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent, yielding **one singlet** (2H).\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1 and C3, the unique one at C2, and the unique one at C5. This leads to **three singlets** with a 6H:3H:3H or 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n### Evaluating the Mixture Options\n\nThe mixture's spectrum has two aromatic singlets and three alkyl singlets.\n\n*   **Option A (1,2,3,4- and 1,2,3,5-):** This mixture would produce five alkyl singlets (two from 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and three from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene), which contradicts the data.\n*   **Option B (1,2,4,5- and 1,2,3,4-):**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Both compounds give one singlet each, resulting in two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. This matches the data.\n    *   **Alkyl:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one singlet (relative integral 12H). 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene gives two singlets (each with a relative integral of 6H). The combination gives three singlets with an intensity ratio of 12H:6H:6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches the observed spectrum.\n*   **Option C (1,2,4,5- and 1,2,3,5-):** This mixture would result in four alkyl singlets (one from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and three from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene), which is inconsistent with the data.\n\nTherefore, the mixture must contain 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThe analysis of the problem and the initial reasoning appear to be correct. The search results confirm the expected NMR patterns for the compounds in question.\n\nHere is a summary of the analysis:\n\n### **1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:** Two singlets around 6.7 ppm with a 1:1 integration ratio. This means the two compounds in the 1:1 mixture must each contribute an equal number of protons to two different singlet signals. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio, each compound must have a singlet in the aromatic region, and the number of protons represented by each singlet must be the same.\n*   **Aliphatic Region:** Three singlets around 2.2 ppm with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. These signals come from the methyl groups.\n\n### **2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Option**\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   *Symmetry:* High symmetry.\n    *   *Aromatic Protons:* Two equivalent protons at positions 3 and 6.

This will produce **two singlets** (1H each).\n    *   *Aliphatic Protons:* Three sets of methyl groups (C1/C3 are equivalent, C2 is unique, C5 is unique). This will produce **three singlets** in a 6H:3H:3H ratio (or 2:1:1).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   *Symmetry:* A plane of symmetry.\n    *   *Aromatic Protons:* Two equivalent protons at positions 5 and 6. This will produce **one singlet** (2H).\n    *   *Aliphatic Protons:* Two sets of equivalent methyl groups (C1/C4 and C2/C3). This will produce **two singlets** in a 6H:6H ratio (or 1:1).\n    *   *Chemical Shifts:* Aromatic protons at ~6.88 ppm and methyl protons at ~2.17 ppm and ~2.24 ppm.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   *Symmetry:* High symmetry.\n    *   *Aromatic Protons:* Four equivalent protons. This will produce **one singlet** (4H).\n    *   *Aliphatic Protons:* The ethyl groups will show coupling. A quartet for the -CH2- group and a triplet for the -CH3 group. This does not match the \"all singlets\" description for the aliphatic region.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Mixtures**\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** This mixture would show three aromatic singlets (one 2H signal and two 1H signals), which contradicts the data.\n*   **B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** This is incorrect because 1,4-diethylbenzene would show a quartet and a triplet, not just singlets, in the aliphatic region.\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** This mixture would show three aromatic singlets (one 2H signal and two 1H signals), which contradicts the data.\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets** with a **1:1 integration ratio** (2H:2H). This perfectly matches the experimental data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene gives two 6H singlets.

It has three sets of methyl groups (C1, C3, and the C2/C5 pair), resulting in three aliphatic singlets with a 1:1:2 ratio of protons.\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** The spectrum for this compound would show a singlet for the four equivalent aromatic protons.

This applies to 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene (C6H4(CH2CH3)2):** 6 carbons in the ring + (2 * 2) carbons in ethyl groups = 10 carbons. 4 hydrogens on the ring + (2 * 5) hydrogens in ethyl groups = 14 hydrogens. The formula is C10H14.\nAll four options are isomers with the correct molecular formula.\n\n**Step 3: Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each individual compound**\n\nWe need to analyze the symmetry of each molecule to predict the number of signals, their multiplicity, and their integration.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C3 and C6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (no adjacent protons) with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **12H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has a single plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        1.  The methyls at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  The methyl at C2 is unique (3H).\n        3.  The methyl at C5 is unique (3H).\n        This will result in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a single plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        1.  The methyls at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  The methyls at C2 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        This will result in **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which simplifies to 1:1.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four protons on the ring are all equivalent, producing **one singlet** with an integration of **4H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The CH2 protons will be split by the CH3 protons, and vice-versa.\n        1.  A **quartet** for the CH2 groups (4H).\n        2.  A **triplet** for the CH3 groups (6H).\n    *   **Careful Point:** The problem states that all signals in the alkyl region are singlets. Since 1,4-diethylbenzene shows a quartet and a triplet, any option containing it (Option A) can be immediately eliminated.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the spectrum of the 1:1 mixture**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture of two of the three tetramethylbenzene isomers that matches the given spectrum.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region Analysis:** All three tetramethylbenzene isomers show one aromatic singlet for 2H. A 1:1 mixture of any two of them will have two different types of aromatic protons, each contributing 2H. This will result in two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio (2H:2H). This part of the data is consistent with any pair of the three tetramethylbenzene isomers.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region Analysis (The Deciding Factor):**\n    *   The mixture has three singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio.\n    *   In a 1:1 mixture, the total number of alkyl (methyl) protons is 12H (from the first compound) + 12H (from the second compound) = 24H.\n    *   Let's find the absolute integration of the signals. If the ratio is 2:1:1, the total integration can be represented as 2x + 1x + 1x = 4x.\n    *   Since 4x = 24H, then x = 6H.\n    *   Therefore, the three singlets in the mixture must have integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n\n**Step 5: Test the remaining combinations**\n\nWe need to find a pair of compounds whose individual alkyl signals combine to give three signals with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene) + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   Prehnitene signals: one 6H singlet, another 6H singlet.\n    *   Isodurene signals: one 6H singlet, one 3H singlet, another 3H singlet.\n    *   Combined: We would have signals of (6H, 6H, 6H, 3H, 3H). This cannot be combined to form signals of 12H, 6H, and 6H. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   Durene signal: one 12H singlet.\n    *   Isodurene signals: one 6H singlet, one 3H singlet, another 3H singlet.\n    *   Combined: We would have four signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H). This does not match the observation of three signals unless two signals accidentally overlap.\n\n*   **Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) + 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   Durene signal: **one 12H singlet**.\n    *   Prehnitene signals: **one 6H singlet** and **another 6H singlet**.\n    *   Combined: This combination directly gives **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n    *   The ratio of these integrations is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   This combination perfectly matches all the data provided in the problem without requiring any assumptions of accidental signal overlap.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe mixture consists of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo solve this, we must analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each compound and then see which 1:1 mixture matches the provided spectral data.\n\n**Analysis of Each Compound's 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** Due to its high symmetry, all four methyl groups are chemically equivalent, and the two aromatic protons are also equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** One singlet (2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** One singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule is less symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** It has two non-equivalent aromatic protons (at positions 4 and 6), which do not have adjacent protons to couple with. This results in two separate singlets (1H each).\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** It has four non-equivalent methyl groups. This would typically produce four singlets. However, accidental overlap is possible. The problem's data of three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio suggests that two of the four methyl groups are coincidentally equivalent in the spectrum, giving a 6H:3H:3H ratio.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** It has two aromatic protons at positions 5 and 6. They are chemically equivalent to each other but are adjacent, which should result in a coupled system (a doublet or multiplet). However, for highly symmetric molecules, this can sometimes appear as a singlet. Spectral data confirms one aromatic signal.\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** The four methyl groups form two equivalence sets: (the outer methyls at 1 and 4) and (the inner methyls at 2 and 3). This results in two singlets, each integrating to 6 protons.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** One singlet (4H).\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** The ethyl groups produce a quartet (for the CH2) and a triplet (for the CH3), not singlets. This compound can be immediately ruled out.\n\n**Evaluation of the Mixture Options:**\n\nThe experimental data for the 1:1 mixture is:\n*   **Aromatic region:** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic region:** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nLet's test the options:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (2H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one singlet (2H). In a 1:1 mixture, this would result in two singlets with a 2H:2H or 1:1 integration ratio. This matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H each). The combination in a 1:1 mixture would show three singlets with relative integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. This simplifies to a 2:1:1 ratio. This also matches the data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one singlet (2H). 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two singlets (1H each). This would result in a total of three aromatic signals. This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (2H). 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two singlets (1H each). This would result in a total of three aromatic signals. This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This option is incorrect because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only mixture that perfectly matches the described 1H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe Python script successfully identified the correct pair of compounds by simulating the 1H NMR spectrum for each possible mixture and comparing it to the experimental data.\n\nThe analysis proceeded as follows:\n*   **Target Spectrum:** The experimental data for the 1:1 mixture required two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio (integrating to 2H each) and three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio (integrating to 12H, 6H, and 6H).\n*   **Option A (1,2,4,5- and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene):** This mixture would produce three aromatic signals and four aliphatic signals, which is inconsistent with the data.\n*   **Option B (1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene):** This option was eliminated because 1,4-diethylbenzene would produce quartets and triplets, not just the singlets observed in the spectrum.\n*   **Option C (1,2,4,5- and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene):** This mixture perfectly matched the target.\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one 2H singlet, and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes one 2H singlet, resulting in two signals in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one 12H singlet, and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes two 6H singlets, resulting in three signals with a 12:6:6 (or 2:1:1) ratio.\n*   **Option D (1,2,3,4- and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene):** This mixture would produce three aromatic signals and five aliphatic signals (before considering accidental overlap), which is inconsistent with the data.\n\nThe script correctly concluded that only the mixture in Option C is consistent with the provided NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nThe search results confirm the initial analysis of the expected NMR spectra for the compounds.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** The spectrum shows two signals. One for the two equivalent aromatic protons (around 6.89 ppm) and one for the four equivalent methyl groups (around 2.18 ppm). This confirms one aromatic singlet and one aliphatic singlet.\n*   **1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** The data shows signals at ~6.88 ppm (aromatic) and ~2.17/2.24 ppm (aliphatic). Critically, the two aromatic protons are adjacent (at C5 and C6) and would form an AB quartet (or two doublets), not a singlet. This makes any option with this compound incorrect.\n*   **1,4-Diethylbenzene:** The spectrum would show a singlet for the four equivalent aromatic protons, but a quartet and a triplet for the ethyl groups, not singlets. This rules out any option with this compound.\n*   **1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** The molecule has a plane of symmetry, making the two aromatic protons (at C4 and C6) equivalent and isolated, resulting in one aromatic singlet. It has three distinct sets of methyl groups: Me at C2, Me at C5, and the equivalent pair at C1/C3. This should result in three aliphatic singlets with an integration ratio of 3H:3H:6H, which simplifies to 1:1:2.\n\nNow, let's re-evaluate the mixture based on this confirmed information.\n\n**Mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Option B):**\n\n1.  **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one 2H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one 2H singlet.\n    *   In a 1:1 mixture, this results in two singlets of equal integration (1:1 ratio), which perfectly matches the problem description.\n\n2.  **Aliphatic Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one 12H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene provides three singlets with integrations of 6H, 3H, and 3H.\n    *   The problem states that the mixture shows **three** singlets in a **2:1:1 ratio**.\n    *   The total number of aliphatic protons in the 1:1 mixture is 12 (from durene) + 12 (from isodurene) = 24 protons.\n    *   A 2:1:1 ratio for 24 protons means the signals must have integrations of:\n        *   (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n        *   (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n        *   (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   Let's see if we can form this pattern from the signals of the two compounds:\n        *   The 12H singlet from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene accounts for the 12H signal (the \"2\" part of the ratio).\n        *   The 6H singlet from the C1/C3 methyls of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene accounts for one of the 6H signals (one \"1\" part of the ratio).\n        *   The remaining two 3H singlets (from C2 and C5 methyls of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene) must be overlapping (accidentally isochronous) to form the third signal, which would have an integration of 3H + 3H = 6H (the other \"1\" part of the ratio).\n\nThis scenario is the only one that fits all the data provided in the question. The other options are ruled out because they do not produce two aromatic singlets.\n\nFinal check:\n- Option A is wrong because 1,2,3,4-TMB gives an aromatic doublet/quartet.\n- Option C is wrong because the aromatic signals would be in a 1:2 ratio, and 1,4-diethylbenzene gives a quartet/triplet in the aliphatic region.\n- Option D is wrong because 1,2,3,4-TMB gives an aromatic doublet/quartet.\n\nTherefore, the mixture must contain 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds:\n\n### **1. Analyze the Provided 1H NMR Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14. All four options satisfy this.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. This indicates two distinct types of aromatic protons in the mixture, and the total number of protons for each type is equal. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar mixture, this could mean each compound provides one type of aromatic proton and has the same number of them, or some other combination that results in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. This indicates three distinct types of alkyl protons, all of which are singlets (implying no adjacent protons, characteristic of methyl groups not adjacent to other protons).\n\n### **2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Compound**\n\nLet's analyze the expected signals for each of the four possible compounds based on their molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has lower symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. They should produce **two distinct singlets**, each integrating to 1H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are in three distinct chemical environments: Me(1) and Me(3) are equivalent, Me(2) is unique, and Me(5) is unique. This would result in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry makes pairs of groups equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent to each other. However, they are adjacent (ortho), so they will couple and appear as a **pair of doublets**, not a singlet. This contradicts the problem description. However, for the sake of thoroughness, let's note it would be one signal area integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at positions 1 and 4 are equivalent, and the methyl groups at positions 2 and 3 are equivalent. This will produce **two singlets**, each integrating to 6H (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are all chemically equivalent and will produce **one singlet** integrating to 4H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The signal for the -CH2- protons will be a **quartet**, and the signal for the -CH3 protons will be a **triplet**. This contradicts the problem's description of only singlets in the alkyl region.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Options**\n\nBased on the individual spectra, we can immediately rule out **1,4-diethylbenzene** because it would show triplets and quartets, not just singlets, in the alkyl region. We can also likely rule out **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** because its aromatic protons would produce doublets, not the singlets described in the problem.\n\nThis leaves **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene** as the most likely candidates (Option A). Let's test this combination.\n\n*   **Mixture A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene gives two 1H singlets. This would result in a total of **three** aromatic signals, which contradicts the data. Even if two signals overlapped, the integration ratios would not be 1:1.\n\nThere seems to be a contradiction. Let's reconsider the alkyl region, which is more complex and thus more informative. The required ratio is **2:1:1**.\n\nLet's re-examine the mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** (Option D), and assume the term \"singlet\" for the aromatic region of 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene was a simplification in the problem statement.\n\n*   **Mixture D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one signal for 2H.\n        *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene provides one signal for 2H.\n        *   This results in two signals with an integration ratio of 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This matches the aromatic data.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides **one singlet** for **12H**.\n        *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene provides **two singlets**, each for **6H**.\n        *   In the mixture, we would see three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n        *   The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches the alkyl data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only one that produces the observed integration ratios in both the aromatic (1:1) and alkyl (2:1:1) regions.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
