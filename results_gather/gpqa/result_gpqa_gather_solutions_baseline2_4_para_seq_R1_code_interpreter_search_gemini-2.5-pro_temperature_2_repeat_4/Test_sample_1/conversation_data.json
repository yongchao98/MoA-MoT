Analysis of Step 1: Grignard Reaction**\n*   **Reaction:** *trans*-cinnamaldehyde is treated with methylmagnesium bromide (CH₃MgBr), a Grignard reagent.\n*   **Mechanism:** Grignard reagents are sources of nucleophilic carbanions. The methyl group (CH₃⁻) from the reagent attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde.

It adds a methylene group (-CH₂-) to the molecule. For an α,β-unsaturated ketone, the reaction typically involves a conjugate addition to form a cyclopropane ring.\n*   **Change in Carbon Count:** The added methylene group contributes **1 carbon atom** to the molecule.\n*   **Carbon Count of Product 3:** 10 (from Product 2) + 1 (added) = **11 carbons**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe number of carbon atoms changes through the reaction sequence as follows:\n*   Start (*trans*-cinnamaldehyde): 9 carbons\n*   Product 1 (after Grignard addition): 10 carbons\n*   Product 2 (after PCC oxidation): 10 carbons\n*   Product 3 (after Corey-Chaykovsky reaction): **11 carbons**\n\nThe final product, Product 3, contains 11 carbon atoms.

It performs a nucleophilic addition to the aldehyde, adding its methyl group (CH₃). This introduces **1 new carbon atom** into the molecule.\n    *   **Carbon Count of Product 1:** 9 + 1 = **10 carbons**.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 + pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) → Product 2**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Product 1, a secondary alcohol formed in the first step, has 10 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Reaction:** Pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) is an oxidizing agent that converts a secondary alcohol into a ketone.

Every answer correctly follows the carbon count through the synthesis: 9 carbons → 10 carbons → 10 carbons → **11 carbons**. This gives very high confidence in the numerical result.\n*   **Typo Handling:** All candidates correctly identified the typo in the third step (\"3 was treated with...\"). They logically and correctly inferred that the reactant for this step is Product 2, the output of the previous step.\n*   **Inconsistent Final Letter:** The final letter choices (A, B, C, D) varied among the candidate answers. This is not due to different chemical conclusions, but rather to the fact that the multiple-choice options were scrambled differently for each candidate. The key takeaway is their universal agreement on the final carbon count of **11**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe step-by-step analysis, strongly supported by the unanimous reasoning of all candidate answers, shows that the final product, Product 3, contains **11** carbon atoms.\n\nThe options provided in the question are:\nA) 10\nB) 12\nC) 11\nD) 14\n\nThe calculated number of carbon atoms (11) corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical synthesis to determine the number of carbon atoms in the final product.\n\n### Analysis of the Reaction Sequence\n\nThe problem requires tracking the number of carbon atoms through a three-step organic synthesis.\n\n1.  **Step 1: *trans*-cinnamaldehyde treated with methylmagnesium bromide to form Product 1.**\n    *   **Starting Material:** The initial reactant is *trans*-cinnamaldehyde.
