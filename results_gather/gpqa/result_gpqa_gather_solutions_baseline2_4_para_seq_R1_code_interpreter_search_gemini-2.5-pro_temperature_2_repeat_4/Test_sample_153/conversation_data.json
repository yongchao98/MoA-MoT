The intensity ratio between these peaks is 100:32, which is approximately 3:1.\n    *   **Interpretation:** This specific 3:1 isotopic ratio is a definitive signature for the presence of a **single chlorine atom**. The natural abundance of chlorine's two stable isotopes, ³⁵Cl (~75%) and ³⁷Cl (~25%), creates this characteristic pattern. The mass of 156 corresponds to the molecule containing the more abundant ³⁵Cl isotope.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The unknown molecule contains one chlorine atom and has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol. All four options have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂ and are consistent with this data. The MS data confirms the elemental composition but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **Observation:** There is an extremely broad absorption peak spanning from 3500 cm⁻¹ down to 2700 cm⁻¹, and a separate strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹.\n    *   **Interpretation:** This combination of signals is the textbook fingerprint for a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group. The extremely broad peak is the O-H stretch, significantly broadened by strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding (dimerization), while the sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is the corresponding C=O (carbonyl) stretch.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a carboxylic acid functional group is confirmed. This allows for the elimination of options that do not contain this group:\n        *   A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (is an aldehyde/phenol) is incorrect.\n        *   D) Phenyl chloroformate (is a chloroformate/ester derivative) is incorrect.\n    *   This narrows the possibilities to B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid and C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n3.  **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis:**\n    *   **Observation:** The spectrum shows three distinct signals:\n        1.  11.0 ppm (s, 1H): A singlet integrating to one proton.\n        2.  8.02 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet integrating to two protons.\n        3.  7.72 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet integrating to two protons.\n    *   **Interpretation:**\n        *   The singlet at 11.0 ppm is located in the far downfield region (10-13 ppm), which is characteristic of the highly deshielded acidic proton of a carboxylic acid. This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n        *   The signals in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm) are the most critical for distinguishing the remaining isomers. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, indicates a high degree of molecular symmetry. This specific pattern is a classic signature for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The two substituents on the benzene ring (the chlorine atom and the carboxylic acid group) must be in a *para* orientation. This allows for a final distinction:\n        *   C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid is *ortho* substituted. It lacks the necessary symmetry and would have four unique aromatic protons, resulting in a much more complex spectrum. It is therefore incorrect.\n        *   B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid is *para* substituted. This structure has the exact symmetry required to produce two doublets of two protons each, perfectly matching the NMR data.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe integration of all three spectroscopic techniques points to a single, unambiguous structure. The MS data confirms the presence of one chlorine atom, the IR data identifies a carboxylic acid functional group, and the ¹H NMR data establishes a *para* (1,4) substitution pattern on the benzene ring. The only compound that satisfies all these criteria is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data, here is a breakdown of the key points leading to the identification of the unknown compound.\n\n### **Careful Points of Analysis**\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n    *   **Key Information:** The molecular ion (M⁺) peak at m/z = 156 and the isotope peak (M⁺+2) at m/z = 158 show a relative intensity ratio of approximately 3:1 (100:32).\n    *   **Inference:** This 3:1 isotopic pattern is the definitive signature for a molecule containing a **single chlorine atom**, due to the natural abundance of the ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This step confirms the molecular weight is 156 (with ³⁵Cl) and the presence of one chlorine atom. All four options are consistent with this initial data.\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   **Key Information:** The spectrum features a very broad absorption from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ and a strong, sharp absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹.\n    *   **Inference:** This combination of signals is an unmistakable fingerprint of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group. The exceptionally broad peak is the hydrogen-bonded O-H stretch, while the sharp 1720 cm⁻¹ peak is the carbonyl (C=O) stretch.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. This eliminates the options that do not possess this functional group:\n        *   A) Phenyl chloroformate (a chloroformate ester) is eliminated.\n        *   C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (an aldehyde and phenol) is eliminated.\n    *   This narrows the possibilities down to the two isomers: B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid and D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n3.  **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Data:**\n    *   **Key Information:** The spectrum shows three signals:\n        1.  11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H)\n        2.  8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H)\n        3.  7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H)\n    *   **Inference 1:** The singlet at 11.0 ppm is characteristic of the highly deshielded acidic proton of a carboxylic acid, confirming the IR analysis.\n    *   **Inference 2:** The pattern in the aromatic region is the most critical for identifying the isomer. The presence of only two signals (both doublets, each representing two protons) indicates a high degree of molecular symmetry. This specific pattern is a textbook signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The two substituents must be in a para arrangement on the ring. This allows for a final decision:\n        *   D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid is *ortho* (1,2) substituted. Its lack of symmetry would lead to four distinct and more complex signals for the aromatic protons, which is inconsistent with the data.\n        *   B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid is *para* (1,4) substituted. Its symmetry perfectly explains the observed NMR spectrum of two doublets of two protons each.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe combined spectroscopic evidence points unequivocally to a single structure. The MS confirms a chlorinated compound, the IR identifies a carboxylic acid functional group, and the ¹H NMR specifies the substitution pattern as para (1,4). The only molecule that fits all these criteria is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the critical points from the provided answers to determine the correct structure.\n\n### **Comprehensive Analysis of Spectral Data**\n\n**1.

The intensity ratio is 100:32, which is approximately 3:1.\n*   **Careful Point 1: Isotopic Signature.** This characteristic 3:1 intensity ratio is a definitive isotopic signature for a molecule containing **a single chlorine atom**, due to the natural abundance of the ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound contains one chlorine atom and has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (using the ³⁵Cl isotope). All four given options have the formula C₇H₅ClO₂ and are consistent with this data. Therefore, this step confirms the presence of chlorine but does not yet distinguish between the isomers.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n*   **Observation:** A very broad absorption from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ and a strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Functional Group Identification.** The combination of these two signals is unmistakable evidence for a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group. The extremely broad peak (often called a \"hairy beard\") is the O-H stretch, significantly broadened by strong hydrogen bonding in acid dimers. The 1720 cm⁻¹ peak is the corresponding C=O (carbonyl) stretch.\n*   **Conclusion:** This finding eliminates any options that are not carboxylic acids.\n    *   **A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde** is an aldehyde/phenol -> Incorrect.\n    *   **B) Phenyl chloroformate** is an acid chloride/ester derivative -> Incorrect.\n    *   This leaves **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid** and **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid** as the only remaining possibilities.\n\n**3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis**\n*   **Observation:** The spectrum shows three signals: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H).\n*   **Careful Point 3: Carboxylic Acid Proton Confirmation.** The singlet at 11.0 ppm is in the classic chemical shift range (10-13 ppm) for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid, further confirming the IR analysis.\n*   **Careful Point 4: Isomer Identification via Symmetry.** The pattern in the aromatic region is the most critical piece of evidence for distinguishing between the remaining isomers. The presence of only **two doublets, each integrating to two protons**, indicates a high degree of molecular symmetry. This pattern is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The two substituents (chlorine and the carboxylic acid group) must be in a para arrangement.\n    *   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid** is *ortho* substituted. It is unsymmetrical and would show four distinct signals in the aromatic region with more complex splitting. This is inconsistent with the data.\n    *   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid** is *para* substituted. This structure has the exact symmetry required to produce two doublets of two protons each, perfectly matching the observed spectrum.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nBy integrating the evidence from all three spectroscopic techniques, the identity of the unknown compound is definitively established. The MS data confirms the presence of one chlorine atom, the IR data identifies the functional group as a carboxylic acid, and the ¹H NMR data specifies the substitution pattern as para (1,4). The only structure that satisfies all these criteria is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on a synthesis of the provided reasoning and the spectral data.\n\n### **Comprehensive Analysis of Spectral Data**\n\nThe reasoning presented by the candidate agents is sound and follows the standard procedure for chemical structure elucidation. All candidates correctly interpret the data, even though they arrive at different final letter choices due to apparent inconsistencies in the option lists they were given. The chemical conclusion, however, is unanimous.\n\n**1. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**\n*   **Careful Point (Isotopic Signature):** The most critical observation is the presence of two molecular ion peaks: one at m/z = 156 (M⁺) and one at m/z = 158 (M⁺+2). The intensity ratio is 100:32, or approximately 3:1. This is a definitive isotopic signature for a molecule containing **a single chlorine atom**, due to the natural abundance of its ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound contains one chlorine atom and has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (using the ³⁵Cl isotope). This is consistent with all four provided options.\n\n**2. Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data**\n*   **Careful Point (Functional Group Identification):** The combination of two specific signals is unequivocal evidence for a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group.\n    *   The very broad absorption from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is the characteristic \"hairy beard\" of an O-H stretch significantly broadened by intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n    *   The strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is the C=O (carbonyl) stretch.\n*   **Conclusion:** This finding eliminates options that are not carboxylic acids. Referring to the original option list:\n    *   A) Phenyl chloroformate - **Eliminated**.\n    *   D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde - **Eliminated**.\n    *   This narrows the possibilities to B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid and C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n**3. Analysis of ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Data**\n*   **Careful Point (Proton Identification and Symmetry):** The NMR data provides the final clues.\n    *   The singlet at 11.0 ppm (1H) is in the classic region for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid, confirming the IR analysis.\n    *   The aromatic region shows a highly symmetrical pattern: **two doublets, each integrating to two protons (2H)**. This pattern is a textbook signature for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The symmetry of this isomer creates only two distinct types of aromatic protons, which split each other's signals into doublets.\n*   **Conclusion:** This confirms the substitution on the benzene ring is *para*. This allows us to distinguish between the two remaining options:\n    *   C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid: This is *ortho* (1,2) substituted. It is not symmetrical and would show four unique, more complex signals for its aromatic protons. This is inconsistent with the data.\n    *   B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid: This is *para* (1,4) substituted. Its symmetry perfectly explains the observed NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nBy combining all the evidence, the identity of the unknown solid is unambiguously determined:\n*   **MS:** Confirms one chlorine atom.\n*   **IR:** Confirms a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **¹H NMR:** Confirms the carboxylic acid and, crucially, establishes a *para* (1,4) substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n\nThe only structure that satisfies all three conditions is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**. In the provided list of options, this corresponds to B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis is a classic structure elucidation problem that requires integrating information from three different types of spectroscopy. A systematic approach, using each piece of data to confirm or eliminate possibilities, is the most effective method. The provided candidate answers all demonstrate a strong and consistent analytical process.\n\nHere is a synthesized step-by-step analysis incorporating the careful points of reasoning:\n\n### **Careful Points of Analysis**\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis: Confirming Elemental Composition**\n*   **Observation**: The spectrum shows a molecular ion peak (M⁺) at m/z = 156 and a significant isotope peak (M⁺+2) at m/z = 158. The relative intensity ratio is 100:32, which is approximately 3:1.\n*   **Interpretation**: This specific 3:1 isotopic ratio is a definitive signature for the presence of a **single chlorine atom**. This is a result of the natural abundance of chlorine's two main isotopes: ³⁵Cl (~75%) and ³⁷Cl (~25%).\n*   **Conclusion**: The molecule contains one chlorine atom, and its molecular weight (using the more abundant ³⁵Cl isotope) is 156 g/mol. All four provided options have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂ and a corresponding molecular weight of 156, so they are all consistent with this data. The MS data confirms composition but does not differentiate the isomers.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis: Identifying the Functional Group**\n*   **Observation**: A very broad absorption from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is present, along with a strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Interpretation**: The combination of these two signals is unmistakable proof of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group. The extremely broad \"hairy beard\" peak is the O-H stretch, significantly broadened by the strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding in carboxylic acid dimers. The sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is the corresponding C=O (carbonyl) stretch.\n*   **Conclusion**: This finding allows for the elimination of options that are not carboxylic acids:\n    *   A) Phenyl chloroformate (an acyl chloride/ester derivative) is incorrect.\n    *   D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (an aldehyde and a phenol) is incorrect.\n    *   This narrows the possibilities to B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid and C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n**3. ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Analysis: Determining the Isomeric Structure**\n*   **Observation**: There are three signals: 11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H), 8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H), and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H).\n*   **Interpretation 1 (Acidic Proton)**: The singlet at 11.0 ppm is in the characteristic region for the highly deshielded acidic proton of a carboxylic acid, corroborating the IR analysis.\n*   **Interpretation 2 (Aromatic Pattern)**: This is the most critical data for identifying the correct isomer. The aromatic region (signals at 8.02 and 7.72 ppm) shows a highly symmetrical pattern: two doublets, with each one integrating to two protons. This is a classic signature for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The molecule's symmetry ensures there are only two chemically distinct types of aromatic protons, which split each other into doublets.\n*   **Conclusion**: The substituents (chlorine and carboxylic acid) must be in a para arrangement on the benzene ring. This definitively rules out the remaining incorrect option:\n    *   C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid is *ortho*-substituted. This lack of symmetry would result in four distinct aromatic proton signals and a much more complex spectrum.\n    *   B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid is *para*-substituted and its symmetry perfectly matches the observed NMR data.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe integration of all three spectroscopic techniques points to a single, unambiguous structure.

Their relative intensities are 100% and 32%, respectively.\n*   **Interpretation:** The intensity ratio of the M⁺ and M⁺+2 peaks is 100:32, which is approximately 3:1. This is the definitive isotopic signature for a molecule containing a **single chlorine atom**, due to the natural abundance of its stable isotopes, ³⁵Cl (~75%) and ³⁷Cl (~25%).\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound contains one chlorine atom and has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (using the more abundant ³⁵Cl isotope).

The singlet at 11.0 ppm is in the far downfield region (>10 ppm), which is characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid, confirming the conclusion from the IR data.\n    2.  The aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm) provides the most crucial information. The pattern of **two doublets, each integrating to two protons,** indicates a high degree of molecular symmetry. This specific pattern is a classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The symmetry makes the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to each other, and the two protons on the other side equivalent as well, resulting in only two signals.\n*   **Conclusion:** The two substituents (chlorine and carboxylic acid) must be in a *para* (1,4) arrangement on the benzene ring.

The relative intensity ratio is 100:32, which is approximately 3:1.\n*   **Interpretation**: This 3:1 ratio for the M⁺ and M⁺+2 peaks is a definitive isotopic signature for a molecule containing **a single chlorine atom**.

This specific isotopic signature is definitive proof that the molecule contains **a single chlorine atom**, due to the natural abundance of chlorine's isotopes, ³⁵Cl (~75%) and ³⁷Cl (~25%).\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound's molecular weight is 156 (using the more abundant ³⁵Cl isotope) and it contains one chlorine atom.

The extremely broad peak is the O-H stretch, significantly broadened by extensive hydrogen bonding (dimerization), and the 1720 cm⁻¹ peak is the corresponding C=O (carbonyl) stretch.\n*   **Conclusion**: This finding confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid and eliminates options that lack this group:\n    *   A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (an aldehyde and phenol) -> **Eliminated**.\n    *   B) Phenyl chloroformate (an acyl chloride/ester derivative) -> **Eliminated**.\n    *   This narrows the possibilities to the two benzoic acid isomers: **2-chlorobenzoic acid** and **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n**3. ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR): Distinguishing Between Isomers**\n*   **Observation**: Three signals are present: 11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H), 8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H), and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H).\n*   **Interpretation 1 (Acidic Proton)**: The singlet at 11.0 ppm is in the characteristic region for the highly deshielded acidic proton of a carboxylic acid, confirming the IR analysis.\n*   **Interpretation 2 (Symmetry)**: The pattern in the aromatic region is the most crucial piece of evidence. The presence of only **two doublets, each integrating to two protons**, indicates a high degree of molecular symmetry. This specific pattern is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n*   **Conclusion**: The two substituents (chlorine and the carboxylic acid) must be in a *para* arrangement. This allows for a final distinction:\n    *   D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid is *ortho* substituted. It is unsymmetrical and would show four unique signals for its four aromatic protons, resulting in a much more complex spectrum. This is inconsistent with the data.\n    *   C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid is *para* substituted. This structure has the exact symmetry required to produce the \"two doublets of 2H each\" pattern, perfectly matching the observed spectrum.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nBy integrating the evidence from all three spectroscopic techniques, the identity of the unknown compound is definitively established. The MS data proves the presence of one chlorine atom, the IR data identifies a carboxylic acid functional group, and the ¹H NMR data specifies a *para* (1,4) substitution pattern on the benzene ring. The only structure that satisfies all these criteria is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n<<<C>>>"

The intensity ratio between these peaks is 100:32, which is approximately 3:1.\n    *   **Interpretation:** This specific 3:1 isotopic ratio is a definitive signature for the presence of a **single chlorine atom**. The natural abundance of chlorine's two stable isotopes, ³⁵Cl (~75%) and ³⁷Cl (~25%), creates this characteristic pattern. The mass of 156 corresponds to the molecule containing the more abundant ³⁵Cl isotope.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The unknown molecule contains one chlorine atom and has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol. All four options have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂ and are consistent with this data. The MS data confirms the elemental composition but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **Observation:** There is an extremely broad absorption peak spanning from 3500 cm⁻¹ down to 2700 cm⁻¹, and a separate strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹.\n    *   **Interpretation:** This combination of signals is the textbook fingerprint for a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group. The extremely broad peak is the O-H stretch, significantly broadened by strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding (dimerization), while the sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is the corresponding C=O (carbonyl) stretch.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a carboxylic acid functional group is confirmed. This allows for the elimination of options that do not contain this group:\n        *   A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (is an aldehyde/phenol) is incorrect.\n        *   D) Phenyl chloroformate (is a chloroformate/ester derivative) is incorrect.\n    *   This narrows the possibilities to B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid and C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n3.  **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis:**\n    *   **Observation:** The spectrum shows three distinct signals:\n        1.  11.0 ppm (s, 1H): A singlet integrating to one proton.\n        2.  8.02 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet integrating to two protons.\n        3.  7.72 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet integrating to two protons.\n    *   **Interpretation:**\n        *   The singlet at 11.0 ppm is located in the far downfield region (10-13 ppm), which is characteristic of the highly deshielded acidic proton of a carboxylic acid. This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n        *   The signals in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm) are the most critical for distinguishing the remaining isomers. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, indicates a high degree of molecular symmetry. This specific pattern is a classic signature for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The two substituents on the benzene ring (the chlorine atom and the carboxylic acid group) must be in a *para* orientation.

All candidates correctly interpret the data, even though they arrive at different final letter choices due to apparent inconsistencies in the option lists they were given. The chemical conclusion, however, is unanimous.\n\n**1. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**\n*   **Careful Point (Isotopic Signature):** The most critical observation is the presence of two molecular ion peaks: one at m/z = 156 (M⁺) and one at m/z = 158 (M⁺+2). The intensity ratio is 100:32, or approximately 3:1. This is a definitive isotopic signature for a molecule containing **a single chlorine atom**, due to the natural abundance of its ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound contains one chlorine atom and has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (using the ³⁵Cl isotope). This is consistent with all four provided options.\n\n**2. Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data**\n*   **Careful Point (Functional Group Identification):** The combination of two specific signals is unequivocal evidence for a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group.\n    *   The very broad absorption from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is the characteristic \"hairy beard\" of an O-H stretch significantly broadened by intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n    *   The strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is the C=O (carbonyl) stretch.\n*   **Conclusion:** This finding eliminates options that are not carboxylic acids.

The relative intensity ratio is 100:32, which is approximately 3:1.\n*   **Interpretation**: This specific 3:1 isotopic ratio is a definitive signature for the presence of a **single chlorine atom**.

This specific pattern is a classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The symmetry makes the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to each other, and the two protons on the other side equivalent as well, resulting in only two signals.\n*   **Conclusion:** The two substituents (chlorine and carboxylic acid) must be in a *para* (1,4) arrangement on the benzene ring.

It lacks symmetry and would show four unique aromatic proton signals, resulting in a much more complex spectrum. It is **incorrect**.\n    *   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is *para* substituted. Its structure possesses the exact symmetry required to produce the \"two doublets of 2H each\" pattern seen in the NMR. It is the **correct** structure.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe combined analysis of all three spectroscopic techniques points to a single structure. The MS confirms one chlorine atom, the IR confirms a carboxylic acid, and the ¹H NMR confirms a *para* substitution pattern. Only **4-chlorobenzoic acid** fits all these criteria.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
