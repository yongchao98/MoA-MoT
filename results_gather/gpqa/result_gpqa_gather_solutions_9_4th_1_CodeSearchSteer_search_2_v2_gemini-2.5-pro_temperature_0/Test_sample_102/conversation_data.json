Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   **Substituents and Positions:**\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The key feature is the 1,3,5-substitution pattern. All three groups are positioned *meta* relative to each other. This pattern is the most important clue for determining the correct order of reactions.\n\n### **2. Analyze Substituent Directing Effects**\nThe order of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) is critical. The directing effects of the substituents already on the ring determine the position of the next incoming group.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** A deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** A deactivating group but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** A strongly deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n\n### **3. Formulate the Optimal Synthetic Strategy**\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern in high yield, the synthesis must be planned to use these directing effects advantageously. The most logical strategy is to install a *meta*-director first.\n\n*   **Starting with Bromination (Option D):** This is incorrect. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director, so the next substitution would yield 1,2- and 1,4-isomers, not the required 1,3-pattern.\n*   **Starting with Nitration (Options A and B):** While the nitro group is a *meta*-director, it strongly deactivates the ring. A subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation (to add the -COCH₃ group) would fail. Therefore, any sequence that attempts to acylate nitrobenzene is not viable. Option A attempts to acylate aniline, which also fails because the basic amino group reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃). Option B is a pointless loop that regenerates benzene.\n*   **Starting with Acylation (Option C):** This is the only viable strategy.\n    1.  **Step i (Acylation):** Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts acylation to form acetophenone. This is an excellent first step as it installs a *meta*-directing acetyl group.\n    2.  **Step ii (Bromination):** The *meta*-directing acetyl group on acetophenone correctly guides the incoming bromine to the 3-position, forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    3.  **Step iii (Nitration):** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to the C5 position. Although the bromo group directs to other positions, the C5 position is electronically favored, leading to the desired **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one** as the major product.\n\n### **4. Conclusion**\nThe sequence outlined in option C is the only one that provides a viable, high-yield route to the target molecule. It correctly utilizes the directing effects of the substituents by first installing a meta-director, which then guides the subsequent substitutions to achieve the desired 1,3,5-pattern. The first three steps of this option constitute a complete and correct synthesis. The subsequent steps listed (iv-vii) are superfluous but do not invalidate the correctness of the initial, successful pathway.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, a careful step-by-step analysis is required.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe final product is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Backbone:** A benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Key Structural Feature:** The substituents are in a **1,3,5-relationship**. This means all three groups are *meta* to each other. This substitution pattern is the most critical clue for determining the reaction order.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\nThe order of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) is governed by the directing effects of the groups already on the ring.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n### **Step 3: Formulate the Optimal Synthetic Strategy**\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern, the synthesis must be planned to use the directing effects advantageously.\n1.  **Choosing the First Step:** The best strategy is to first install a **meta-director**.\n    *   Starting with bromination (an *ortho, para*-director) would lead to 1,2- and 1,4-disubstituted products, which is incorrect.\n    *   Starting with nitration installs a *meta*-director, but the resulting nitrobenzene is too strongly deactivated for a subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation (to add the acetyl group).\n    *   Therefore, the only logical first step is **Friedel-Crafts acylation** to produce acetophenone. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director and allows for further substitutions.\n\n2.  **Building the Correct Sequence:**\n    *   **Step i: Acylation.** Benzene reacts with CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ to form acetophenone. This places a meta-director on the ring.\n    *   **Step ii: Bromination.** The meta-directing acetyl group on acetophenone directs the incoming bromine to the 3-position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    *   **Step iii: Nitration.** The ring now has a meta-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an ortho, para-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to the 5-position. This position is also favored because it is meta to both deactivating groups, leading to the desired final product.\n\nThe only viable, high-yield pathway is: **Acylation → Bromination → Nitration**.\n\n### **Step 4: Evaluate the Given Options**\nNow, we evaluate the options from the question against this correct pathway.\n\n*   **A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    This sequence (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) is a pointless loop that starts with benzene and regenerates benzene. It does not produce the target molecule.\n\n*   **B) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n    This option follows the exact sequence determined to be correct: Acylation → Bromination → Nitration. The first three steps successfully synthesize the target molecule. The subsequent steps listed are superfluous, but the initial pathway is correct and leads to the product.\n\n*   **C) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    This sequence forms aniline (steps i and ii) and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation. This reaction fails because the basic amino group (-NH₂) reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), deactivating the ring.\n\n*   **D) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    This sequence starts with bromination, installing an *ortho, para*-director. This would lead to the wrong isomers in the next step, not the required 1,3,5-pattern.\n\nBased on this analysis, only option B describes a chemically sound route to the desired product.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Structure:** It is a benzene ring with three substituents.\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH₃) is at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) is at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO₂) is at position 5.\n*   **Key Feature:** The substituents are in a **1,3,5-pattern**. This means all three groups are *meta* to each other. This pattern is the most important clue for determining the correct order of reactions.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\nThe order of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) is critical. The directing effects of the groups determine where the next substituent will be added.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n**3. Formulate the Optimal Synthetic Strategy**\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern, the synthesis must be planned logically.\n*   The best strategy is to first install a **meta-director**. This will guide the second substituent to the correct meta position.\n*   Starting with bromination is incorrect because the bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director, which would lead to 1,2- and 1,4-isomers.\n*   Starting with nitration is also not ideal. Although the nitro group is a meta-director, it strongly deactivates the ring, which would cause a subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation (to add the acetyl group) to fail.\n*   Therefore, the best first step is **Friedel-Crafts acylation** to add the acetyl group.\n\n**4. Develop the Correct Sequence**\n1.  **Step i: Acylation.** Benzene reacts with CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ to form acetophenone. This correctly installs a meta-directing group.\n2.  **Step ii: Bromination.** The acetyl group on acetophenone directs the incoming bromine to the meta position (C3), forming 3-bromoacetophenone. This correctly establishes the 1,3-relationship.\n3.  **Step iii: Nitration.** The ring now has a meta-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an ortho, para-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to C5. The bromo group directs to C2, C4, and C6. In this case of conflicting directors, the position at C5 is favored, leading to the desired product.\n\nThe correct sequence of core reactions is: **Acylation → Bromination → Nitration**.\n\n**5. Evaluate the Given Options**\nNow, we match this correct pathway to the provided options.\n\n*   **A) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...**\n    This sequence follows the correct order: Acylation → Bromination → Nitration. The first three steps successfully synthesize the target molecule. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are superfluous, but the initial pathway is correct and leads to the product.\n\n*   **B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**\n    This sequence attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline (the product of steps i and ii).

It does not produce the target molecule.\n\nThe final answer is A\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents.\n    *   Position 1: An acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n    *   Position 3: A bromo group (-Br).\n    *   Position 5: A nitro group (-NO₂).\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The key feature is the 1,3,5-substitution pattern. All three groups are positioned *meta* relative to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\nThe order of the reactions is critical because the group(s) already on the benzene ring will direct the next incoming group to a specific position during electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS).\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** This is a deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** This is a deactivating group but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** This is a strongly deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n\n**3. Formulate the Optimal Synthetic Strategy**\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern in high yield, the synthetic strategy must be carefully planned. The most logical approach is to first introduce a meta-director to guide the subsequent substitutions.\n*   **Starting with Bromination:** If we start by adding bromine, the bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director. The next substitution would yield 1,2- and 1,4-disubstituted products, not the required 1,3-pattern. This is an incorrect approach.\n*   **Starting with Nitration:** If we start with nitration, we get nitrobenzene. The nitro group is a *meta*-director, which is good. However, it is also strongly deactivating, which means a subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation (to add the -COCH₃ group) will fail. This is not a viable approach.\n*   **Starting with Acylation:** This is the most promising strategy.\n    1.  **Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation.** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This is an excellent first step as it installs a *meta*-directing acetyl group.\n    2.  **Step 2: Bromination.** The *meta*-directing acetyl group on acetophenone directs the incoming bromine to the 3-position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    3.  **Step 3: Nitration.** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5. Although the bromo group directs to other positions (2, 4, 6), the position meta to both deactivating groups (C5) is the most favorable site for substitution. This step successfully yields the target molecule.\n\nThe correct sequence of essential reactions is: **Acylation → Bromination → Nitration**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\nNow, we match this correct pathway to the options provided.\n\n*   **A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    This sequence (nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination) starts with benzene and ends with benzene. It is a pointless loop and does not produce the target molecule. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    This sequence forms aniline (the product of steps i and ii) and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation. This reaction fails because the basic amino group (-NH₂) of aniline reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), deactivating the ring. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n    This sequence starts with bromination, placing an *ortho, para*-director on the ring. This will not lead to the desired 1,3,5-pattern. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n    This sequence follows the correct order: Acylation → Bromination → Nitration. The first three steps successfully synthesize the target molecule in high yield. The subsequent steps listed (iv-vii) are superfluous and do not contribute to the synthesis, but the initial pathway is correct and leads to the product. **Correct.**\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe molecule to be synthesized is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Parent Structure:** Acetophenone (a benzene ring with an acetyl group, -COCH₃).\n*   **Substituents:**\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Key Structural Feature:** The substituents are in a **1,3,5-relationship**. This means all three groups are positioned *meta* to each other. This substitution pattern is the most important clue for determining the correct reaction order.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\nThe order of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) is critical. The directing effects of the substituents already on the ring determine where the next group will be added.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n### **Step 3: Formulate the Optimal Synthetic Strategy**\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern, the synthesis must be planned logically. The most effective strategy is to install a **meta-director** first.\n\n1.  **Consider the First Step:**\n    *   **Starting with Bromination (Option D):** This would place an *ortho, para*-director on the ring, leading to 1,2- and 1,4-disubstituted products in the next step. This is incorrect for a 1,3,5-pattern.\n    *   **Starting with Nitration (Options A and B):** While the nitro group is a *meta*-director, it is strongly deactivating. A subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation (to add the -COCH₃ group) would fail or give a very low yield on the highly deactivated nitrobenzene ring. This is not a high-yield strategy.\n    *   **Starting with Acylation (Option C):** This is the most logical first step. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director and is only moderately deactivating, allowing for further substitutions.\n\n2.  **Develop the Correct Sequence:**\n    *   **Step i: Friedel-Crafts Acylation.** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This correctly installs a *meta*-director.\n        `Benzene + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ → Acetophenone`\n    *   **Step ii: Bromination.** The *meta*-directing acetyl group on acetophenone directs the incoming bromine to the 3-position.\n        `Acetophenone + Br₂/FeBr₃ → 3-Bromoacetophenone`\n    *   **Step iii: Nitration.** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to C5. Although the bromo group directs to other positions (C2, C4, C6), the position at C5 is electronically favored, leading to the desired **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one** as the major product.\n\n### **Step 4: Evaluate the Given Options**\nThe analysis shows that the only viable high-yield pathway is **Acylation → Bromination → Nitration**.\n\n*   **A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...:** This sequence is a pointless loop that regenerates benzene. Incorrect.\n*   **B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...:** This sequence attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline, which fails.

An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The substituents are in a 1,3,5-relationship. This means all three groups are *meta* to each other, which is the most critical clue for determining the reaction order.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Substituent Directing Effects\n\nThe order of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) is governed by the directing effects of the groups already on the ring.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n### Step 3: Formulate the Optimal Synthetic Strategy\n\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern, the synthesis must be planned to use these directing effects advantageously.

It adds the acetyl group, which is a *meta*-director and only moderately deactivates the ring, allowing for further substitutions.\n\n2.  **Developing the Sequence:**\n    *   **Step i: Acylation.** Benzene reacts with CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ to form acetophenone. This correctly installs a *meta*-director at position 1.\n    *   **Step ii: Bromination.** The *meta*-directing acetyl group on acetophenone will guide the incoming bromine to the 3-position. This reaction (Br₂/FeBr₃) yields 3-bromoacetophenone, establishing the correct 1,3-relationship.\n    *   **Step iii: Nitration.** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to C5. The bromo group directs to C2, C4, and C6.

Analyze the Target Molecule\nThe goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents.\n    *   Position 1: An acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n    *   Position 3: A bromo group (-Br).\n    *   Position 5: A nitro group (-NO₂).\n*   **Key Structural Feature:** The substituents are in a 1,3,5-relationship. This means all three groups are *meta* to each other. This substitution pattern is the most important clue for determining the correct reaction order.\n\n### 2. Analyze Substituent Properties (Directing Effects)\nThe order of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) is critical. The directing effects of the substituents already on the ring determine where the next group will be added.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** A deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** A deactivating group but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** A strongly deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n\n### 3. Formulate the Optimal Synthetic Strategy\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern, the synthesis must be planned logically. The most effective strategy is to install a *meta*-directing group first.\n\n1.  **Choosing the First Step:**\n    *   Starting with bromination (adding an *ortho, para*-director) would lead to 1,2- and 1,4-products in the next step, which is incorrect.\n    *   Starting with nitration would add a *meta*-director, but the resulting nitrobenzene is too strongly deactivated for a subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation (adding the acetyl group). This reaction would fail.\n    *   Therefore, the only viable first step is **Friedel-Crafts acylation** to add the acetyl group. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director and only moderately deactivating, allowing further substitutions.\n\n2.  **Determining the Subsequent Steps:**\n    *   **Step i: Acylation.** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This correctly installs the *meta*-directing acetyl group.\n    *   **Step ii: Bromination.** The *meta*-directing acetyl group on acetophenone will guide the incoming bromine to the 3-position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    *   **Step iii: Nitration.** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to the C5 position. Although the bromo group directs to other positions, the C5 position is electronically favored, leading to the desired **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one** as the major product.\n\nThe correct core sequence is: **Acylation → Bromination → Nitration**.\n\n### 4. Evaluate the Given Options\nNow, we match this correct pathway to the options provided in the question.\n\n*   **A) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ...**: This sequence starts with bromination, installing an *ortho, para*-director. This is an incorrect strategy for achieving a 1,3,5-pattern.\n\n*   **B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂...**: This sequence (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) is a pointless loop that starts with benzene and ends with benzene. It does not produce the target molecule.\n\n*   **C) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...**: This sequence follows the exact pathway determined to be correct. The first three steps (Acylation → Bromination → Nitration) successfully produce the target molecule. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are superfluous for this synthesis, but the initial, core pathway is correct and leads to the product.\n\n*   **D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**: This sequence forms aniline (the product of steps i and ii) and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation. This reaction fails because the basic amino group (-NH₂) of aniline reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), deactivating the ring.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on a thorough chemical analysis, the only option that contains a viable synthetic route is C. It correctly utilizes the directing effects of the substituents by first installing a meta-director (the acetyl group), which then guides the subsequent substitutions to achieve the required 1,3,5-pattern.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the provided answers and the chemical principles involved, here is the definitive decision process.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Target Molecule**\n\nThe goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. The key features of this molecule are:\n*   A benzene ring as the core structure.\n*   Three substituents: an acetyl group (-COCH₃), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO₂).\n*   A specific **1,3,5-substitution pattern**. This means all three groups are in a *meta* relationship to one another, which is the most critical clue for determining the reaction order.\n\n### **2. Analysis of Substituent Directing Effects**\n\nThe order of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) is governed by the directing effects of the groups already on the ring:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** A deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** A deactivating group but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** A strongly deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n\n### **3. Determining the Optimal Synthetic Strategy**\n\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern, the synthesis must be planned logically.\n*   **Starting with an ortho, para-director is incorrect.** Beginning with bromination (adding the -Br group) would direct the next substituent to the ortho and para positions, not the required meta position.\n*   **Starting with a strong deactivator can prevent subsequent reactions.** Beginning with nitration (adding the -NO₂ group) would create nitrobenzene. The nitro group is so strongly deactivating that a subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation (to add the -COCH₃ group) would fail.\n*   **The correct strategy is to start with a meta-director that still allows for further reactions.** Friedel-Crafts acylation is the ideal first step.\n\nThe correct sequence of reactions is therefore:\n1.  **Acylation:** Benzene is reacted with CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ to form acetophenone. This installs the acetyl group, which is a meta-director.\n2.  **Bromination:** The acetyl group on acetophenone directs the incoming bromine to the meta position (C3), correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n3.  **Nitration:** The ring now has a meta-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an ortho, para-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to C5. This position is favored, leading to the desired final product.\n\n### **4.

This is a pointless loop that starts with benzene and ends with benzene, not the target product. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    This sequence forms aniline in the first two steps. Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the basic amino group (-NH₂) reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), deactivating the ring. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n    This sequence perfectly matches the optimal strategy derived above.\n    *   Step (i) correctly performs acylation.\n    *   Step (ii) correctly performs meta-bromination.\n    *   Step (iii) correctly performs nitration to yield the final product.\n    The first three steps lead to the high-yield synthesis of the target molecule. The subsequent steps listed in the option are superfluous but do not invalidate the correctness of the initial, successful synthesis. **This is the correct option.**\n\n*   **D) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    This sequence starts with bromination, installing an ortho, para-director.

Formulate the Optimal Synthetic Strategy\nTo achieve a 1,3,5-pattern in high yield, the synthesis must be planned logically. The most effective strategy is to install a *meta*-director first.\n\n*   **Consider the first step:**\n    *   Starting with bromination (adding an *ortho, para*-director) would lead to 1,2- and 1,4-disubstituted products in the next step, which is incorrect for the desired 1,3,5-pattern.\n    *   Starting with nitration would add a *meta*-director (-NO₂), but this group is so strongly deactivating that a subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation (to add the -COCH₃ group) would fail.\n    *   Therefore, the best first step is **Friedel-Crafts acylation** to add the acetyl group. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director and is only moderately deactivating, allowing further substitutions.\n\n*   **Develop the sequence:**\n    1.  **Step 1: Acylation.** Benzene reacts with CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ to form acetophenone. This correctly installs a *meta*-director.\n    2.  **Step 2: Bromination.** The *meta*-directing acetyl group on acetophenone will guide the incoming bromine to the 3-position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    3.  **Step 3: Nitration.** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The powerful *meta*-directing acetyl group will guide the incoming nitro group to the C5 position. This successfully yields the target molecule, **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n\nThe optimal high-yield pathway is: **i) Acylation → ii) Bromination → iii) Nitration**.\n\n### 4.

This pattern is the most critical clue for determining the correct order of reactions.\n\n### 2. Analyze Substituent Directing Effects\nThe order of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) is crucial. The directing effect of the group(s) already on the ring determines the position of the next incoming group.\n*   **-COCH₃ (Acetyl group):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **-Br (Bromo group):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **-NO₂ (Nitro group):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n### 3. Formulate the Optimal Synthetic Strategy\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern in high yield, the synthesis must be planned logically. The most effective strategy is to install a **meta-director** first.\n\n*   **Starting with Bromination (Option B):** If we add the bromo group first, it acts as an *ortho, para*-director. The next substitution would yield a mixture of 1,2- and 1,4-disubstituted products, not the required 1,3-pattern. This is an incorrect approach.\n*   **Starting with Nitration (Options C and D):** If we add the nitro group first, we get nitrobenzene. While the nitro group is a *meta*-director, it is also strongly deactivating. A subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation (to add the -COCH₃ group) would fail on the highly deactivated nitrobenzene ring. Therefore, any sequence that attempts this is incorrect. Option D fails for this reason. Option C is a pointless loop that regenerates benzene in the first four steps.\n*   **Starting with Acylation (Option A):** This is the most promising strategy.\n    1.  **Step i (Acylation):** Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts acylation to form acetophenone. This is an excellent first step as it installs a **meta-directing** acetyl group.\n    2.  **Step ii (Bromination):** The *meta*-directing acetyl group on acetophenone correctly guides the incoming bromine to the 3-position, forming 3-bromoacetophenone. This establishes the required 1,3-relationship.\n    3.  **Step iii (Nitration):** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5. Although the bromo group directs to other positions (2, 4, 6), substitution at C5 is the major product because it is meta to both deactivating groups. This step successfully yields the target molecule, **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nThe only chemically sound pathway that leads to the desired product is presented in option A. It correctly utilizes the directing effects of the substituents by first installing a meta-director (the acetyl group), which then guides the subsequent substitutions to achieve the required 1,3,5-pattern. The subsequent steps listed in option A (iv-vii) are superfluous and do not contribute to the synthesis of the target molecule, but the initial three steps constitute the only valid synthesis among the choices.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n### **1.

A subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation (to add the -COCH₃ group) would fail on the highly deactivated nitrobenzene ring.\n*   **Starting with Acylation (a meta-director):** This is the best approach. The acetyl group is a meta-director, and it does not deactivate the ring so severely as to prevent further substitutions.\n\nThe correct sequence of key reactions is therefore:\n1.  **Acylation:** Benzene is converted to acetophenone.

This correctly installs a *meta*-director.\n    2.  **Step ii (Bromination):** The *meta*-directing acetyl group on acetophenone guides the incoming bromine to the 3-position, forming 3-bromoacetophenone. This correctly establishes the 1,3-relationship.\n    3.  **Step iii (Nitration):** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to C5. The directing effects of the two groups work together to favor substitution at C5, yielding the target molecule, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence is chemically sound and provides a high-yield route to the desired product. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are superfluous for this synthesis but do not invalidate the correctness of the initial, successful pathway.\n\n*   **B) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    *   This sequence is incorrect because it starts with bromination, installing an *ortho, para*-director, which leads to the wrong isomers.\n\n*   **C) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    *   This sequence (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) is a pointless loop that starts with benzene and ends with benzene. It does not synthesize the target molecule.\n\n*   **D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    *   This sequence is incorrect because it attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline (the product of steps i and ii). This reaction fails because the basic amino group (-NH₂) reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), deactivating the ring.\n\nBased on this analysis, only Option A describes a viable synthetic route.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one** starting from benzene.\n*   **Core Structure:** A benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Key Structural Feature:** The substituents are in a **1,3,5-pattern**. This means all three groups are *meta* to each other. This pattern is the most important clue for determining the correct order of reactions.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Chemical Principles**\n\nThe order of reactions in Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS) is critical. We must consider two key factors:\n*   **Directing Effects:** The group(s) already on the ring direct the next incoming group to specific positions.\n    *   **-COCH₃ (Acetyl):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n    *   **-Br (Bromo):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n    *   **-NO₂ (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Reactivity and Reaction Feasibility:**\n    *   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃):** This reaction is crucial for adding the acetyl group. However, it fails on strongly deactivated rings (e.g., nitrobenzene) and on rings containing an amino group (-NH₂) because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic nitrogen.\n\n### **3. Formulate the Optimal Synthetic Strategy**\n\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern, the synthesis must be planned logically. The best strategy is to install a *meta*-director first.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Choose the First Reaction.**\n    *   Starting with bromination is incorrect because the bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director, which would lead to 1,2- and 1,4-products in the next step.\n    *   Starting with nitration is incorrect because the resulting nitrobenzene is too strongly deactivated for a subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation to add the acetyl group.\n    *   Therefore, the only viable first step is **Friedel-Crafts Acylation** to produce acetophenone. This installs a *meta*-directing acetyl group.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Add the Second Substituent.**\n    *   With acetophenone as the substrate, the *meta*-directing acetyl group will guide the next substituent to the 3-position. **Bromination** at this stage correctly yields 3-bromoacetophenone, establishing the desired 1,3-relationship.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Add the Final Substituent.**\n    *   The substrate is now 3-bromoacetophenone. It has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). **Nitration** is performed. The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to C5. The bromo group directs to C2, C4, and C6. The position at C5 is favored, leading to the desired final product.\n\nThe only chemically sound, high-yield pathway is: **Acylation → Bromination → Nitration**.\n\n### **4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nNow, we match this correct pathway to the options provided in the question.\n\n*   **A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**\n    *   This sequence attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline (the product of steps i and ii). This reaction fails. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **B) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...**\n    *   This sequence follows the exact pathway determined to be correct: Acylation → Bromination → Nitration. The first three steps produce the desired product. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are superfluous, but the initial sequence is the only valid one among the choices that leads to the target molecule. **Correct.**\n\n*   **C) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**\n    *   This sequence starts with bromination, installing an *ortho, para*-director, which leads to the wrong isomers. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂...**\n    *   This sequence is a pointless loop that starts with benzene and regenerates benzene after four steps. It does not produce the target molecule. **Incorrect.**\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, a careful, step-by-step analysis is required.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Structure:** It is a benzene ring with three substituents.\n    1.  An **acetyl group** (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A **bromo group** (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A **nitro group** (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Key Structural Feature:** The substituents are in a **1,3,5-relationship**. This means all three groups are positioned *meta* to each other, which is the most critical clue for planning the synthesis.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Substituent Properties (Directing Effects)**\n\nThe order of the reactions is crucial because the substituents already on the ring direct the next incoming group during electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS).\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n### **Step 3: Formulate the Optimal Synthetic Strategy**\n\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern, the synthesis must begin by installing a **meta-director**. This will guide the subsequent substitutions to the correct positions.\n\n1.  **Starting with Friedel-Crafts Acylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃):** This is the most logical first step. It places an acetyl group on the ring, which is a meta-director. The ring is only moderately deactivated, allowing for further substitutions.\n2.  **Starting with Bromination (Br₂/FeBr₃):** This is incorrect. It would place an *ortho, para*-director on the ring, leading to 1,2- and 1,4-disubstituted products in the next step, not the required 1,3-pattern.\n3.  **Starting with Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄):** This is also incorrect. Although the nitro group is a meta-director, it is so strongly deactivating that a subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction would fail.\n\nTherefore, the only viable strategy begins with acylation. The correct pathway is:\n1.  **Step i (Acylation):** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. The acetyl group will now direct the next substituent to the *meta* position (C3).\n2.  **Step ii (Bromination):** Acetophenone is brominated to form 3-bromoacetophenone, correctly establishing the 1,3-relationship.\n3.  **Step iii (Nitration):** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to C5. Although the bromo group directs to other positions, the position at C5 is electronically favored, leading to the desired **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one** as the major product.\n\n### **Step 4: Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct sequence of core reactions is **Acylation → Bromination → Nitration**. We now evaluate the given options:\n\n*   **A) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n    This sequence follows the correct order: Acylation, then Bromination, then Nitration. The first three steps successfully synthesize the target molecule. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are superfluous and do not contribute to this specific synthesis, but the initial pathway is correct and leads to the product.\n\n*   **B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    This sequence is a pointless loop. The reactions of nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination would convert benzene back into benzene. This is not a productive synthesis.\n\n*   **C) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    This sequence starts with bromination, installing an *ortho, para*-director, which will not produce the correct 1,3,5-isomer pattern.\n\n*   **D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    This sequence forms aniline (the product of steps i and ii). The subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation (step iii) fails because the basic amino group of aniline reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), deactivating the ring.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only option that contains a chemically viable route to the target molecule is A. It correctly utilizes the directing effects of the substituents by first installing a meta-director, which then guides the subsequent substitutions to achieve the required 1,3,5-pattern.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

The most logical strategy is to install a *meta*-director first.\n\n*   **Starting with Bromination (Option D):** This is incorrect.

A subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation (to add the -COCH₃ group) would fail. Therefore, any sequence that attempts to acylate nitrobenzene is not viable. Option A attempts to acylate aniline, which also fails because the basic amino group reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃). Option B is a pointless loop that regenerates benzene.\n*   **Starting with Acylation (Option C):** This is the only viable strategy.\n    1.  **Step i (Acylation):** Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts acylation to form acetophenone.

It does not produce the target molecule.\n\nThe final answer is A\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents.\n    *   Position 1: An acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n    *   Position 3: A bromo group (-Br).\n    *   Position 5: A nitro group (-NO₂).\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The key feature is the 1,3,5-substitution pattern. All three groups are positioned *meta* relative to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\nThe order of the reactions is critical because the group(s) already on the benzene ring will direct the next incoming group to a specific position during electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS).\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** This is a deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** This is a deactivating group but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** This is a strongly deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n\n**3. Formulate the Optimal Synthetic Strategy**\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern in high yield, the synthetic strategy must be carefully planned. The most logical approach is to first introduce a meta-director to guide the subsequent substitutions.\n*   **Starting with Bromination:** If we start by adding bromine, the bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director. The next substitution would yield 1,2- and 1,4-disubstituted products, not the required 1,3-pattern. This is an incorrect approach.\n*   **Starting with Nitration:** If we start with nitration, we get nitrobenzene. The nitro group is a *meta*-director, which is good. However, it is also strongly deactivating, which means a subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation (to add the -COCH₃ group) will fail. This is not a viable approach.\n*   **Starting with Acylation:** This is the most promising strategy.\n    1.  **Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation.** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This is an excellent first step as it installs a *meta*-directing acetyl group.\n    2.  **Step 2: Bromination.** The *meta*-directing acetyl group on acetophenone directs the incoming bromine to the 3-position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    3.  **Step 3: Nitration.** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5. Although the bromo group directs to other positions (2, 4, 6), the position meta to both deactivating groups (C5) is the most favorable site for substitution. This step successfully yields the target molecule.\n\nThe correct sequence of essential reactions is: **Acylation → Bromination → Nitration**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\nNow, we match this correct pathway to the options provided.\n\n*   **A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    This sequence (nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination) starts with benzene and ends with benzene. It is a pointless loop and does not produce the target molecule. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    This sequence forms aniline (the product of steps i and ii) and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation. This reaction fails because the basic amino group (-NH₂) of aniline reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), deactivating the ring. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n    This sequence starts with bromination, placing an *ortho, para*-director on the ring. This will not lead to the desired 1,3,5-pattern. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n    This sequence follows the correct order: Acylation → Bromination → Nitration. The first three steps successfully synthesize the target molecule in high yield. The subsequent steps listed (iv-vii) are superfluous and do not contribute to the synthesis, but the initial pathway is correct and leads to the product. **Correct.**\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe molecule to be synthesized is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Parent Structure:** Acetophenone (a benzene ring with an acetyl group, -COCH₃).\n*   **Substituents:**\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Key Structural Feature:** The substituents are in a **1,3,5-relationship**. This means all three groups are positioned *meta* to each other. This substitution pattern is the most important clue for determining the correct reaction order.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\nThe order of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) is critical. The directing effects of the substituents already on the ring determine where the next group will be added.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n### **Step 3: Formulate the Optimal Synthetic Strategy**\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern, the synthesis must be planned logically. The most effective strategy is to install a **meta-director** first.\n\n1.  **Consider the First Step:**\n    *   **Starting with Bromination (Option D):** This would place an *ortho, para*-director on the ring, leading to 1,2- and 1,4-disubstituted products in the next step. This is incorrect for a 1,3,5-pattern.\n    *   **Starting with Nitration (Options A and B):** While the nitro group is a *meta*-director, it is strongly deactivating. A subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation (to add the -COCH₃ group) would fail or give a very low yield on the highly deactivated nitrobenzene ring. This is not a high-yield strategy.\n    *   **Starting with Acylation (Option C):** This is the most logical first step. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director and is only moderately deactivating, allowing for further substitutions.\n\n2.  **Develop the Correct Sequence:**\n    *   **Step i: Friedel-Crafts Acylation.** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This correctly installs a *meta*-director.\n        `Benzene + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ → Acetophenone`\n    *   **Step ii: Bromination.** The *meta*-directing acetyl group on acetophenone directs the incoming bromine to the 3-position.\n        `Acetophenone + Br₂/FeBr₃ → 3-Bromoacetophenone`\n    *   **Step iii: Nitration.** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to C5. Although the bromo group directs to other positions (C2, C4, C6), the position at C5 is electronically favored, leading to the desired **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one** as the major product.\n\n### **Step 4: Evaluate the Given Options**\nThe analysis shows that the only viable high-yield pathway is **Acylation → Bromination → Nitration**.\n\n*   **A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...:** This sequence is a pointless loop that regenerates benzene. Incorrect.\n*   **B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...:** This sequence attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline, which fails. Incorrect.\n*   **C) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...:** The first three steps of this sequence perfectly match the valid synthetic pathway derived above. The target molecule is successfully formed. The subsequent steps are superfluous but do not invalidate the correctness of the initial, successful synthesis. **Correct.**\n*   **D) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ...:** This sequence starts with an *ortho, para*-director, leading to the wrong isomers. Incorrect.\n\nBased on a thorough chemical analysis, the sequence in option C is the only one that provides a viable, high-yield route to the target molecule.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, a careful step-by-step analysis is required, considering the directing effects of each substituent and the feasibility of the reactions.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Core Structure:** A benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The substituents are in a 1,3,5-relationship. This means all three groups are *meta* to each other, which is the most critical clue for determining the reaction order.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Substituent Directing Effects\n\nThe order of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) is governed by the directing effects of the groups already on the ring.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n### Step 3: Formulate the Optimal Synthetic Strategy\n\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern, the synthesis must be planned to use these directing effects advantageously. The most logical strategy is to install a *meta*-director first.\n\n1.  **Choosing the First Step:**\n    *   Starting with **bromination** (adding an *ortho, para*-director) would lead to 1,2- and 1,4-disubstituted products in the next step, which is incorrect.\n    *   Starting with **nitration** adds a *meta*-director, but the resulting nitrobenzene is so strongly deactivated that a subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation (to add the acetyl group) would fail.\n    *   Starting with **Friedel-Crafts acylation** is the best choice. It adds the acetyl group, which is a *meta*-director and only moderately deactivates the ring, allowing for further substitutions.\n\n2.  **Developing the Sequence:**\n    *   **Step i: Acylation.** Benzene reacts with CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ to form acetophenone. This correctly installs a *meta*-director at position 1.\n    *   **Step ii: Bromination.** The *meta*-directing acetyl group on acetophenone will guide the incoming bromine to the 3-position. This reaction (Br₂/FeBr₃) yields 3-bromoacetophenone, establishing the correct 1,3-relationship.\n    *   **Step iii: Nitration.** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to C5. The bromo group directs to C2, C4, and C6. The position at C5 is favored because it is meta to both deactivating groups, leading to the desired **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Given Options\n\nThe derived correct sequence of core reactions is: **Acylation → Bromination → Nitration**. Now, we evaluate the options from the question.\n\n*   **A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    This sequence is a pointless loop that starts with benzene and regenerates it after four steps. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n    This sequence starts with bromination, installing an *ortho, para*-director, which will not lead to the required 1,3,5-pattern. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n    This sequence perfectly matches the optimal pathway derived above. The first three steps (acylation, bromination, nitration) successfully produce the target molecule in high yield. The subsequent steps listed in the option are superfluous for this synthesis but do not invalidate the correctness of the initial, successful route.\n\n*   **D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    This sequence forms aniline (steps i and ii) and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation. This reaction fails because the basic amino group (-NH₂) reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), deactivating the ring. This is incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on a thorough analysis of chemical principles, the only sequence that provides a viable, high-yield route to the target molecule is Option C. It correctly utilizes the directing effects of the substituents by first installing a meta-director, which then guides the subsequent substitutions to achieve the required 1,3,5-pattern.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1.

The directing effects of the substituents already on the ring determine where the next group will be added.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** A deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** A deactivating group but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** A strongly deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n\n### 3. Formulate the Optimal Synthetic Strategy\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern, the synthesis must be planned logically. The most effective strategy is to install a *meta*-directing group first.\n\n1.  **Choosing the First Step:**\n    *   Starting with bromination (adding an *ortho, para*-director) would lead to 1,2- and 1,4-products in the next step, which is incorrect.\n    *   Starting with nitration would add a *meta*-director, but the resulting nitrobenzene is too strongly deactivated for a subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation (adding the acetyl group). This reaction would fail.\n    *   Therefore, the only viable first step is **Friedel-Crafts acylation** to add the acetyl group. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director and only moderately deactivating, allowing further substitutions.\n\n2.  **Determining the Subsequent Steps:**\n    *   **Step i: Acylation.** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This correctly installs the *meta*-directing acetyl group.\n    *   **Step ii: Bromination.** The *meta*-directing acetyl group on acetophenone will guide the incoming bromine to the 3-position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    *   **Step iii: Nitration.** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3).

Analysis of the Target Molecule**\n\nThe goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. The key features of this molecule are:\n*   A benzene ring as the core structure.\n*   Three substituents: an acetyl group (-COCH₃), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO₂).\n*   A specific **1,3,5-substitution pattern**. This means all three groups are in a *meta* relationship to one another, which is the most critical clue for determining the reaction order.\n\n### **2. Analysis of Substituent Directing Effects**\n\nThe order of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) is governed by the directing effects of the groups already on the ring:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** A deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** A deactivating group but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** A strongly deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n\n### **3. Determining the Optimal Synthetic Strategy**\n\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern, the synthesis must be planned logically.\n*   **Starting with an ortho, para-director is incorrect.** Beginning with bromination (adding the -Br group) would direct the next substituent to the ortho and para positions, not the required meta position.\n*   **Starting with a strong deactivator can prevent subsequent reactions.** Beginning with nitration (adding the -NO₂ group) would create nitrobenzene. The nitro group is so strongly deactivating that a subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation (to add the -COCH₃ group) would fail.\n*   **The correct strategy is to start with a meta-director that still allows for further reactions.** Friedel-Crafts acylation is the ideal first step.\n\nThe correct sequence of reactions is therefore:\n1.  **Acylation:** Benzene is reacted with CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ to form acetophenone. This installs the acetyl group, which is a meta-director.\n2.  **Bromination:** The acetyl group on acetophenone directs the incoming bromine to the meta position (C3), correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n3.  **Nitration:** The ring now has a meta-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an ortho, para-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to C5. This position is favored, leading to the desired final product.\n\n### **4.

This is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    This sequence forms aniline in the first two steps. Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the basic amino group (-NH₂) reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), deactivating the ring.

Analyze Substituent Properties (Directing Effects)\nThe order of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) is critical. The directing effects of the groups already on the ring determine the position of the next incoming group.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n### 3. Formulate the Optimal Synthetic Strategy\nTo achieve a 1,3,5-pattern in high yield, the synthesis must be planned logically. The most effective strategy is to install a *meta*-director first.\n\n*   **Consider the first step:**\n    *   Starting with bromination (adding an *ortho, para*-director) would lead to 1,2- and 1,4-disubstituted products in the next step, which is incorrect for the desired 1,3,5-pattern.\n    *   Starting with nitration would add a *meta*-director (-NO₂), but this group is so strongly deactivating that a subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation (to add the -COCH₃ group) would fail.\n    *   Therefore, the best first step is **Friedel-Crafts acylation** to add the acetyl group. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director and is only moderately deactivating, allowing further substitutions.\n\n*   **Develop the sequence:**\n    1.  **Step 1: Acylation.** Benzene reacts with CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ to form acetophenone. This correctly installs a *meta*-director.\n    2.  **Step 2: Bromination.** The *meta*-directing acetyl group on acetophenone will guide the incoming bromine to the 3-position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    3.  **Step 3: Nitration.** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The powerful *meta*-directing acetyl group will guide the incoming nitro group to the C5 position.

This reaction fails because the basic amino group reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), deactivating the ring. Incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, Option A is the only one that contains a chemically sound and logical pathway to the desired product.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\nThe goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Core Structure:** A benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The key feature is the 1,3,5-substitution pattern. All three groups are positioned *meta* relative to each other. This pattern is the most critical clue for determining the correct order of reactions.\n\n### 2. Analyze Substituent Directing Effects\nThe order of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) is crucial. The directing effect of the group(s) already on the ring determines the position of the next incoming group.\n*   **-COCH₃ (Acetyl group):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **-Br (Bromo group):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **-NO₂ (Nitro group):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n### 3. Formulate the Optimal Synthetic Strategy\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern in high yield, the synthesis must be planned logically. The most effective strategy is to install a **meta-director** first.\n\n*   **Starting with Bromination (Option B):** If we add the bromo group first, it acts as an *ortho, para*-director. The next substitution would yield a mixture of 1,2- and 1,4-disubstituted products, not the required 1,3-pattern. This is an incorrect approach.\n*   **Starting with Nitration (Options C and D):** If we add the nitro group first, we get nitrobenzene. While the nitro group is a *meta*-director, it is also strongly deactivating. A subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation (to add the -COCH₃ group) would fail on the highly deactivated nitrobenzene ring. Therefore, any sequence that attempts this is incorrect. Option D fails for this reason. Option C is a pointless loop that regenerates benzene in the first four steps.\n*   **Starting with Acylation (Option A):** This is the most promising strategy.\n    1.  **Step i (Acylation):** Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts acylation to form acetophenone. This is an excellent first step as it installs a **meta-directing** acetyl group.\n    2.  **Step ii (Bromination):** The *meta*-directing acetyl group on acetophenone correctly guides the incoming bromine to the 3-position, forming 3-bromoacetophenone. This establishes the required 1,3-relationship.\n    3.  **Step iii (Nitration):** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5. Although the bromo group directs to other positions (2, 4, 6), substitution at C5 is the major product because it is meta to both deactivating groups. This step successfully yields the target molecule, **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nThe only chemically sound pathway that leads to the desired product is presented in option A. It correctly utilizes the directing effects of the substituents by first installing a meta-director (the acetyl group), which then guides the subsequent substitutions to achieve the required 1,3,5-pattern. The subsequent steps listed in option A (iv-vii) are superfluous and do not contribute to the synthesis of the target molecule, but the initial three steps constitute the only valid synthesis among the choices.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n*   **Name:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents:\n    1.  An **acetyl group** (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A **bromo group** (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A **nitro group** (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Key Feature:** The substituents are in a **1,3,5-relationship**. All three groups are *meta* to each other. This specific substitution pattern is the most critical clue for determining the correct reaction order.\n\n### **2. Analyze Substituent Directing Effects**\nThe order of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) is crucial. The directing effects of the substituents already on the ring determine where the next group will be added.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n### **3. Formulate the Optimal Synthetic Strategy**\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern, the synthesis must be planned logically. The most effective strategy is to install a **meta-director** first, which will guide the subsequent substitutions.\n\n*   **Starting with Bromination (an o,p-director):** This would lead to 1,2- and 1,4-disubstituted products in the next step, which is incorrect for the desired 1,3,5-pattern.\n*   **Starting with Nitration (a meta-director):** While the nitro group is a meta-director, it strongly deactivates the ring. A subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation (to add the -COCH₃ group) would fail on the highly deactivated nitrobenzene ring.\n*   **Starting with Acylation (a meta-director):** This is the best approach. The acetyl group is a meta-director, and it does not deactivate the ring so severely as to prevent further substitutions.\n\nThe correct sequence of key reactions is therefore:\n1.  **Acylation:** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This installs the meta-directing acetyl group.\n2.  **Bromination:** The acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the *meta* position (C3), forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n3.  **Nitration:** The ring now has a meta-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an o,p-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to the other meta position (C5). This yields the final product, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\n### **4.

It does not produce the target molecule. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **B) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃...**: This sequence starts with bromination, installing an *ortho, para*-director. This will lead to the wrong isomers in the next step. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃...**: This sequence forms aniline (the product of steps i and ii) and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation. This reaction fails because the basic amino group (-NH₂) reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), deactivating the ring. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄...**: This sequence follows the correct pathway.\n    *   **Step i (Acylation):** Correctly forms acetophenone.\n    *   **Step ii (Bromination):** Correctly forms 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    *   **Step iii (Nitration):** Correctly forms the final product, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    The first three steps constitute a valid, high-yield synthesis. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are superfluous and do not contribute to the synthesis, but the initial pathway is correct and leads to the product. **Correct.**\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n### 1.

Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one** starting from benzene.\n*   **Core Structure:** A benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Key Structural Feature:** The substituents are in a **1,3,5-pattern**. This means all three groups are *meta* to each other. This pattern is the most important clue for determining the correct order of reactions.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Chemical Principles**\n\nThe order of reactions in Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS) is critical. We must consider two key factors:\n*   **Directing Effects:** The group(s) already on the ring direct the next incoming group to specific positions.\n    *   **-COCH₃ (Acetyl):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n    *   **-Br (Bromo):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n    *   **-NO₂ (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Reactivity and Reaction Feasibility:**\n    *   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃):** This reaction is crucial for adding the acetyl group. However, it fails on strongly deactivated rings (e.g., nitrobenzene) and on rings containing an amino group (-NH₂) because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic nitrogen.\n\n### **3. Formulate the Optimal Synthetic Strategy**\n\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern, the synthesis must be planned logically. The best strategy is to install a *meta*-director first.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Choose the First Reaction.**\n    *   Starting with bromination is incorrect because the bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director, which would lead to 1,2- and 1,4-products in the next step.\n    *   Starting with nitration is incorrect because the resulting nitrobenzene is too strongly deactivated for a subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation to add the acetyl group.\n    *   Therefore, the only viable first step is **Friedel-Crafts Acylation** to produce acetophenone. This installs a *meta*-directing acetyl group.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Add the Second Substituent.**\n    *   With acetophenone as the substrate, the *meta*-directing acetyl group will guide the next substituent to the 3-position. **Bromination** at this stage correctly yields 3-bromoacetophenone, establishing the desired 1,3-relationship.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Add the Final Substituent.**\n    *   The substrate is now 3-bromoacetophenone. It has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). **Nitration** is performed. The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to C5. The bromo group directs to C2, C4, and C6. The position at C5 is favored, leading to the desired final product.\n\nThe only chemically sound, high-yield pathway is: **Acylation → Bromination → Nitration**.\n\n### **4.

It does not produce the target molecule. **Incorrect.**\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, a careful, step-by-step analysis is required.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Structure:** It is a benzene ring with three substituents.\n    1.  An **acetyl group** (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A **bromo group** (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A **nitro group** (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Key Structural Feature:** The substituents are in a **1,3,5-relationship**. This means all three groups are positioned *meta* to each other, which is the most critical clue for planning the synthesis.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Substituent Properties (Directing Effects)**\n\nThe order of the reactions is crucial because the substituents already on the ring direct the next incoming group during electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS).\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n### **Step 3: Formulate the Optimal Synthetic Strategy**\n\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern, the synthesis must begin by installing a **meta-director**. This will guide the subsequent substitutions to the correct positions.\n\n1.  **Starting with Friedel-Crafts Acylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃):** This is the most logical first step. It places an acetyl group on the ring, which is a meta-director. The ring is only moderately deactivated, allowing for further substitutions.\n2.  **Starting with Bromination (Br₂/FeBr₃):** This is incorrect. It would place an *ortho, para*-director on the ring, leading to 1,2- and 1,4-disubstituted products in the next step, not the required 1,3-pattern.\n3.  **Starting with Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄):** This is also incorrect. Although the nitro group is a meta-director, it is so strongly deactivating that a subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction would fail.\n\nTherefore, the only viable strategy begins with acylation. The correct pathway is:\n1.  **Step i (Acylation):** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. The acetyl group will now direct the next substituent to the *meta* position (C3).\n2.  **Step ii (Bromination):** Acetophenone is brominated to form 3-bromoacetophenone, correctly establishing the 1,3-relationship.\n3.  **Step iii (Nitration):** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to C5. Although the bromo group directs to other positions, the position at C5 is electronically favored, leading to the desired **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one** as the major product.\n\n### **Step 4: Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct sequence of core reactions is **Acylation → Bromination → Nitration**. We now evaluate the given options:\n\n*   **A) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n    This sequence follows the correct order: Acylation, then Bromination, then Nitration. The first three steps successfully synthesize the target molecule. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are superfluous and do not contribute to this specific synthesis, but the initial pathway is correct and leads to the product.\n\n*   **B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    This sequence is a pointless loop. The reactions of nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination would convert benzene back into benzene. This is not a productive synthesis.\n\n*   **C) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    This sequence starts with bromination, installing an *ortho, para*-director, which will not produce the correct 1,3,5-isomer pattern.\n\n*   **D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    This sequence forms aniline (the product of steps i and ii). The subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation (step iii) fails because the basic amino group of aniline reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), deactivating the ring.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only option that contains a chemically viable route to the target molecule is A. It correctly utilizes the directing effects of the substituents by first installing a meta-director, which then guides the subsequent substitutions to achieve the required 1,3,5-pattern.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
