All agents correctly calculated the energy levels and their degeneracies, arriving at the same final expression. The only discrepancy is in which lettered option this correct expression corresponds to, which is likely due to the agents being presented with scrambled lists of options.\n\nTo provide a definitive answer, I will perform the calculation from first principles and then carefully match the result to the specific list of options given in the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the System's States**: The system has three spins (S1, S2, S3), and each spin can be either +1 or -1. The total number of possible configurations (microstates) is 2³ = 8.\n\n2.  **Calculate Energy Levels and Degeneracies**: The energy of the system is given by the Hamiltonian E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. We can group the 8 microstates into two distinct energy levels.\n\n    *   **Case 1: All spins are aligned.**\n        This configuration occurs in two states: (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1).\n        *   For the state (+1, +1, +1): E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1)] = -J(3) = **-3J**.\n        *   For the state (-1, -1, -1): E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J(1 + 1 + 1) = **-3J**.\n        *   This gives an energy level **E₁ = -3J** with a degeneracy (number of states) of **g₁ = 2**.\n\n    *   **Case 2: One spin is flipped relative to the other two.**\n        This configuration accounts for the remaining six states. We can calculate the energy for a representative state, such as (+1, +1, -1).\n        *   For the state (+1, +1, -1): E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1)] = -J(1 - 1 - 1) = -J(-1) = **+J**.\n        *   Due to the symmetry of the Hamiltonian, all six states of this type have the same energy. The states are: (+1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, +1), (-1, +1, +1), (+1, -1, -1), (-1, +1, -1), and (-1, -1, +1).\n        *   This gives an energy level **E₂ = +J** with a degeneracy of **g₂ = 6**.\n\n3.  **Construct the Partition Function (Z)**: The partition function is the sum of the Boltzmann factors for all states, which can be grouped by their energy levels and degeneracies.\n    Z = g₁ * e^(-βE₁) + g₂ * e^(-βE₂)\n\n    Substituting the values we found:\n    Z = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(+J))\n\n    Simplifying the exponents gives the final expression:\n    **Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)**\n\n4.  **Compare with the Given Options**: We now compare our derived result with the options provided in the question:\n    A) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\n    B) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\n    C) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\n    D) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\n\n    The calculated expression `Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)` exactly matches option **B**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Calculation Consensus**: All candidate answers correctly derive the mathematical formula `Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)`. This provides very high confidence in the physics and the calculation steps. The final step is simply matching this result to the correct option letter.\n*   **State Enumeration**: It is crucial to account for all 8 microstates. A good check is that the sum of the degeneracies (2 + 6) equals the total number of states (8).\n*   **Energy Calculation Signs**: The signs in the energy calculation are critical. For the aligned states, the sum of products is +3, leading to an energy of -3J. For the one-flipped states, the sum of products is -1, leading to an energy of +J.\n*   **Boltzmann Factor Signs**: The exponent in the Boltzmann factor is `-βE`. This is a common source of error. For the energy level E₁ = -3J, the term becomes `e^(-β * -3J) = e^(3Jβ)`. For the energy level E₂ = +J, the term becomes `e^(-β * J) = e^(-Jβ)`.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on an analysis of the provided candidate answers and a first-principles derivation, the following is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the System's States and Energy Function**: The system has three spins (S1, S2, S3), each taking a value of +1 or -1. This gives a total of 2³ = 8 possible microstates. The energy for each state is given by the Hamiltonian: E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3].\n\n2.  **Calculate Energy Levels and Their Degeneracies**: The most efficient method is to group the 8 states by their spin configuration, which determines their energy. There are two distinct energy levels.\n\n    *   **Case 1: All spins are aligned.**\n        This configuration includes two states: (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1).\n        *   For state (+1, +1, +1): E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1)] = -J = -3J.\n        *   For state (-1, -1, -1): E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J.\n        *   **Result**: There are **2 states** with an energy of **E₁ = -3J**. The degeneracy is g₁ = 2.\n\n    *   **Case 2: One spin is flipped relative to the other two.**\n        This configuration accounts for the remaining six states. Let's calculate the energy for a representative state, such as (+1, +1, -1).\n        *   For state (+1, +1, -1): E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J.\n        *   Due to the symmetry of the Hamiltonian, all six states in this category have the same energy.\n        *   **Result**: There are **6 states** with an energy of **E₂ = J**. The degeneracy is g₂ = 6.\n\n3.  **Construct the Partition Function (Z)**: The partition function is the sum over all distinct energy levels, where each term is the degeneracy of that level multiplied by its Boltzmann factor.\n    Z = Σᵢ gᵢ * e^(-βEᵢ)\n    Z = g₁ * e^(-βE₁) + g₂ * e^(-βE₂)\n\n    Substituting the calculated values:\n    Z = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(J))\n\n    Simplifying the exponents gives the final expression:\n    **Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)**\n\n4.  **Compare with the Given Options**: The calculated partition function is `Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)`. Now, we compare this result to the options provided in the question:\n    A) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\n    B) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\n    C) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\n    D) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\n\n    The derived expression exactly matches option **C**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Analysis of Candidate Answers**: All 15 candidate answers correctly derive the mathematical formula `Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)`. This shows a unanimous consensus on the physics and the calculation steps. The discrepancy in their final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) is due to them being presented with different or scrambled lists of options. This gives very high confidence in the correctness of the derived formula.\n*   **State Enumeration**: It is crucial to account for all 8 microstates. Grouping them by configuration (\"all aligned\" vs. \"one flipped\") is an effective strategy. A good check is that the sum of the degeneracies (2 + 6) equals the total number of states (8).\n*   **Energy Calculation Signs**: The signs in the energy calculation are critical. The leading negative sign in the energy formula, E = **-J**[...], must be applied correctly. For the 6 states with one flipped spin, the sum `S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3` is -1, making the energy E = -J(-1) = +J.\n*   **Boltzmann Factor Signs**: The exponent in the Boltzmann factor is **-βE**. This is a frequent source of error. For the negative energy level E₁ = -3J, the exponent becomes positive: `-β(-3J) = +3Jβ`. For the positive energy level E₂ = J, the exponent becomes negative: `-β(J) = -Jβ`.\n*   **Final Matching**: As demonstrated by the variance in the candidate answers, the final and most critical step is to carefully match the correct mathematical expression to the specific list of options provided in the problem statement.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to first independently solve the problem to verify the mathematical result, which all candidate answers seem to agree upon. The main discrepancy in the provided answers is the final letter choice, likely due to the options being presented in a different order to each agent. Therefore, the crucial step is to carefully match the derived correct formula to the specific list of options provided in the user's question. I will use a Python script to programmatically enumerate all states, calculate the energy levels and their degeneracies, construct the partition function, and compare it against the given options to determine the correct choice.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **System Definition**: The system has three spins (S1, S2, S3), and each can be +1 or -1. This gives a total of 2³ = 8 possible microstates.\n\n2.  **Energy Calculation**: The energy is given by E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. We need to find the energy for all 8 states. We can group them into two configurations:\n    *   **Case 1: All spins aligned**. This happens in two states: (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1).\n        *   For (+1, +1, +1): E = -J[1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1] = -3J.\n        *   For (-1, -1, -1): E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1+1+1] = -3J.\n        *   This gives an energy level **E₁ = -3J** with a degeneracy (number of states) of **g₁ = 2**.\n    *   **Case 2: One spin flipped**. This accounts for the remaining 6 states (e.g., (+1, +1, -1)).\n        *   For (+1, +1, -1): E = -J[1*1 + 1*(-1) + 1*(-1)] = -J[1-1-1] = -J[-1] = +J.\n        *   By symmetry, all 6 of these states have the same energy.\n        *   This gives an energy level **E₂ = +J** with a degeneracy of **g₂ = 6**.\n\n3.  **Partition Function Construction**: The partition function Z is the sum of Boltzmann factors for each energy level, weighted by degeneracy:\n    Z = g₁ * e^(-βE₁) + g₂ * e^(-βE₂)\n    Z = 2 * e^(-β * (-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β * J)\n    Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\n4.  **Matching with Options**: The derived formula is **Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)**. Comparing this to the options in the question:\n    *   A) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)  <-- This is a perfect match.\n    *   B) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\n    *   C) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\n    *   D) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **State Enumeration**: It's essential to account for all 8 microstates. A good check is that the sum of degeneracies (2 + 6) equals the total number of states (8).\n*   **Sign Conventions**: Care must be taken with the negative signs in both the energy formula `E = -J[...]` and the Boltzmann factor exponent `e^(-βE)`. A negative energy E results in a positive exponent.\n*   **Matching to Options**: The analysis of candidate answers shows that while the derivation is consistently correct, the final letter choice varies. This highlights the critical importance of matching the derived formula to the specific list of options provided in the original problem, as this was the source of error for the other agents.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_partition_function():\n    \"\"\"\n    Systematically calculates the partition function for the three-spin system\n    and compares it to the given options to determine the final answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    spin_values = [1, -1]\n    energy_coeffs = []\n\n    # Step 1: Iterate through all 2^3 = 8 states and calculate their energy coefficient.\n    # The energy is E = -J * (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3).

The total number of possible configurations (microstates) is 2 × 2 × 2 = 8.\n\n2.  **Define the Energy Function (Hamiltonian)**: The energy of any given state is E = -J[ S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ].\n\n3.  **Calculate Energy Levels and Degeneracies**: To find the partition function, we need to sum the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE), over all 8 states. The most efficient way is to group the states by their energy level and count the number of states (degeneracy, g) at each level.\n\n    *   **Case 1: All spins are aligned.**\n        This configuration includes two states: (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1).\n        *   For state (+1, +1, +1): E = -J [ (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) ] = -J [3] = **-3J**.\n        *   For state (-1, -1, -1): E = -J [ (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) ] = -J [1 + 1 + 1] = **-3J**.\n        *   **Result**: There are **2 states** with an energy of **E₁ = -3J**. The degeneracy is g₁ = 2.\n\n    *   **Case 2: One spin is flipped relative to the other two.**\n        This configuration includes the remaining six states. Let's calculate the energy for a representative state, for example, (+1, +1, -1):\n        *   For state (+1, +1, -1): E = -J [ (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) ] = -J [1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = **+J**.\n        *   Due to the symmetry of the Hamiltonian, all six of these states have the same energy.\n        *   **Result**: There are **6 states** with an energy of **E₂ = +J**. The degeneracy is g₂ = 6.\n\n4.  **Construct the Partition Function (Z)**: The partition function is the sum of the Boltzmann factors for each energy level, weighted by their degeneracy:\n    Z = g₁ * e^(-βE₁) + g₂ * e^(-βE₂)\n\n    Substituting the values we found:\n    Z = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(+J))\n\n    Simplifying the exponents gives the final expression:\n    **Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)**\n\n5.  **Compare with the Given Options**: We now compare our derived result with the options provided in the question:\n    A) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\n    B) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\n    C) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\n    D) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\n\n    Our calculated expression `Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)` exactly matches option **B**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **State Enumeration**: It is crucial to account for all 8 microstates. A good check is that the sum of the degeneracies (2 + 6) equals the total number of states (8).\n2.  **Energy Calculation Signs**: The overall negative sign in the Hamiltonian `E = -J[...]` is critical. For the 6 states with one flipped spin, the sum `S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3` is -1, which, when multiplied by the `-J` pre-factor, results in a positive energy of `+J`.\n3.  **Boltzmann Factor Signs**: The exponent in the Boltzmann factor is `-βE`. This is a common source of sign errors. For the energy level E₁ = -3J, the exponent becomes `-β(-3J) = +3Jβ`. For E₂ = +J, the exponent is `-β(+J) = -Jβ`.\n4.  **Analysis of Candidate Answers**: All 15 candidate answers correctly derive the mathematical formula `Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)`. This shows a unanimous consensus on the physics and the calculation steps. The discrepancies in their final letter choices (A, B, C, D) are due to the agents being presented with different or scrambled lists of options. The core calculation is correct in all of them. The final step is to match the correct formula to the specific list of options provided in this problem.\n\nBased on the rigorous derivation, which is confirmed by all candidate answers, the correct expression is `Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)`, which corresponds to option B in the provided list.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis problem requires us to calculate the partition function for a system of three interacting spins. The solution involves enumerating all possible states of the system, calculating the energy for each state, grouping the states by energy level to find their degeneracies, and finally summing the Boltzmann factors for each energy level.\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation\n\n1.  **Identify the System's States**: The system has three spins (S1, S2, S3), and each spin can be either +1 or -1. The total number of possible microstates is 2³ = 8.\n\n2.  **Calculate Energy Levels and Degeneracies**: The energy of the system is given by the Hamiltonian E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. We can find the energy for all 8 states by grouping them into two distinct configuration types based on their symmetry.\n\n    *   **Case 1: All spins are aligned.**\n        This configuration includes two states: (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1).\n        *   For the state (+1, +1, +1):\n            E = -J [ (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) ] = -J [3] = **-3J**.\n        *   For the state (-1, -1, -1):\n            E = -J [ (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) ] = -J [1 + 1 + 1] = **-3J**.\n        *   This gives an energy level **E₁ = -3J** with a degeneracy (number of states) of **g₁ = 2**.\n\n    *   **Case 2: One spin is flipped relative to the other two.**\n        This configuration accounts for the remaining six states. We can calculate the energy for a representative state, such as (+1, +1, -1).\n        *   For the state (+1, +1, -1):\n            E = -J [ (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) ] = -J [1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = **+J**.\n        *   Due to the symmetry of the Hamiltonian, all six states in this category have the same energy. The states are: (+1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, +1), (-1, +1, +1), (+1, -1, -1), (-1, +1, -1), and (-1, -1, +1).\n        *   This gives an energy level **E₂ = +J** with a degeneracy of **g₂ = 6**.\n\n3.  **Construct the Partition Function (Z)**: The partition function is the sum over all distinct energy levels, where each term is the degeneracy of that level multiplied by its Boltzmann factor.\n    Z = Σᵢ gᵢ * e^(-βEᵢ)\n    Z = g₁ * e^(-βE₁) + g₂ * e^(-βE₂)\n\n    Substituting the values we found:\n    Z = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(J))\n\n    Simplifying the exponents gives the final expression:\n    **Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)**\n\n4.  **Compare with the Given Options**: We now compare our derived result with the options provided in the question:\n    A) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\n    B) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\n    C) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\n    D) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\n\n    Our calculated expression `Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)` exactly matches option **C**.\n\n### Analysis of Candidate Answers and Careful Points\n\n*   **Unanimous Calculation**: All 15 candidate answers correctly derive the mathematical formula `Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)`. This provides extremely high confidence in the physics and the calculation steps. The discrepancy in their final letter choices (A, B, C, D) is due to the fact that the options were presented in a different, randomized order to each agent.\n*   **Careful Point 1: State Enumeration**: It is crucial to account for all 2³ = 8 microstates. A good check is to ensure the sum of the degeneracies (2 + 6) equals the total number of states (8).\n*   **Careful Point 2: Energy Calculation Signs**: The energy formula E = **-J**[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3] has a leading negative sign. For the 6 states with one flipped spin, the sum in the brackets is -1, which results in a positive energy E = -J(-1) = +J. This is a critical step where errors can occur.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Boltzmann Factor Exponent Signs**: The exponent in the Boltzmann factor is **-βE**.

Let's calculate the energy for a representative state, such as (+1, +1, -1).\n        *   For state (+1, +1, -1): E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J.\n        *   Due to the symmetry of the Hamiltonian, all six states in this category have the same energy.\n        *   **Result**: There are **6 states** with an energy of **E₂ = J**.

This shows a unanimous consensus on the physics and the calculation steps. The discrepancy in their final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) is due to them being presented with different or scrambled lists of options. This gives very high confidence in the correctness of the derived formula.\n*   **State Enumeration**: It is crucial to account for all 8 microstates. Grouping them by configuration (\"all aligned\" vs. \"one flipped\") is an effective strategy. A good check is that the sum of the degeneracies (2 + 6) equals the total number of states (8).\n*   **Energy Calculation Signs**: The signs in the energy calculation are critical. The leading negative sign in the energy formula, E = **-J**[...], must be applied correctly. For the 6 states with one flipped spin, the sum `S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3` is -1, making the energy E = -J(-1) = +J.\n*   **Boltzmann Factor Signs**: The exponent in the Boltzmann factor is **-βE**. This is a frequent source of error. For the negative energy level E₁ = -3J, the exponent becomes positive: `-β(-3J) = +3Jβ`. For the positive energy level E₂ = J, the exponent becomes negative: `-β(J) = -Jβ`.\n*   **Final Matching**: As demonstrated by the variance in the candidate answers, the final and most critical step is to carefully match the correct mathematical expression to the specific list of options provided in the problem statement.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to first independently solve the problem to verify the mathematical result, which all candidate answers seem to agree upon.

I will use a Python script to programmatically enumerate all states, calculate the energy levels and their degeneracies, construct the partition function, and compare it against the given options to determine the correct choice.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **System Definition**: The system has three spins (S1, S2, S3), and each can be +1 or -1. This gives a total of 2³ = 8 possible microstates.\n\n2.  **Energy Calculation**: The energy is given by E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. We need to find the energy for all 8 states. We can group them into two configurations:\n    *   **Case 1: All spins aligned**. This happens in two states: (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1).\n        *   For (+1, +1, +1): E = -J[1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1] = -3J.\n        *   For (-1, -1, -1): E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1+1+1] = -3J.\n        *   This gives an energy level **E₁ = -3J** with a degeneracy (number of states) of **g₁ = 2**.\n    *   **Case 2: One spin flipped**. This accounts for the remaining 6 states (e.g., (+1, +1, -1)).\n        *   For (+1, +1, -1): E = -J[1*1 + 1*(-1) + 1*(-1)] = -J[1-1-1] = -J[-1] = +J.\n        *   By symmetry, all 6 of these states have the same energy.\n        *   This gives an energy level **E₂ = +J** with a degeneracy of **g₂ = 6**.\n\n3.  **Partition Function Construction**: The partition function Z is the sum of Boltzmann factors for each energy level, weighted by degeneracy:\n    Z = g₁ * e^(-βE₁) + g₂ * e^(-βE₂)\n    Z = 2 * e^(-β * (-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β * J)\n    Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\n4.  **Matching with Options**: The derived formula is **Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)**. Comparing this to the options in the question:\n    *   A) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)  <-- This is a perfect match.\n    *   B) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\n    *   C) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\n    *   D) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **State Enumeration**: It's essential to account for all 8 microstates. A good check is that the sum of degeneracies (2 + 6) equals the total number of states (8).\n*   **Sign Conventions**: Care must be taken with the negative signs in both the energy formula `E = -J[...]` and the Boltzmann factor exponent `e^(-βE)`. A negative energy E results in a positive exponent.\n*   **Matching to Options**: The analysis of candidate answers shows that while the derivation is consistently correct, the final letter choice varies.

The most efficient way is to group the states by their energy level and count the number of states (degeneracy, g) at each level.\n\n    *   **Case 1: All spins are aligned.**\n        This configuration includes two states: (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1).\n        *   For state (+1, +1, +1): E = -J [ (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) ] = -J [3] = **-3J**.\n        *   For state (-1, -1, -1): E = -J [ (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) ] = -J [1 + 1 + 1] = **-3J**.\n        *   **Result**: There are **2 states** with an energy of **E₁ = -3J**.

We can calculate the energy for a representative state, such as (+1, +1, -1).\n        *   For state (+1, +1, -1): E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = **+J**.\n        *   Due to the symmetry of the Hamiltonian, all six states in this category have the same energy.\n        *   This gives an energy level **E₂ = +J** with a degeneracy of **g₂ = 6**.\n\n4.  **Construct the Partition Function (Z)**: The partition function is the sum of the Boltzmann factors for all states, which can be grouped by their energy levels and degeneracies.\n    Z = g₁ * e^(-βE₁) + g₂ * e^(-βE₂)\n\n    Substituting the values we found:\n    Z = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(+J))\n\n    Simplifying the exponents gives the final expression:\n    **Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)**\n\n5.  **Compare with Given Options**: We now compare our derived result with the options provided in the question:\n    A) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\n    B) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\n    C) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\n    D) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\n\n    The calculated expression `Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)` exactly matches option C.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **State Enumeration**: It is crucial to account for all 8 microstates. A good check is that the sum of the degeneracies (2 + 6) equals the total number of states (8). This was done correctly in all candidate answers.\n*   **Energy Calculation Signs**: The signs in the energy calculation are critical. The leading negative sign in the Hamiltonian `E = -J[...]` is a key detail. For the 6 states with one flipped spin, the sum `S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3` is -1, making the energy `E = -J(-1) = +J`.\n*   **Boltzmann Factor Exponent Signs**: The exponent in the Boltzmann factor is `-βE`. This is a very common source of error. When an energy level `E` is negative (like E₁ = -3J), the exponent becomes positive: `-β(-3J) = +3Jβ`. This critical step was handled correctly in all candidate answers.\n*   **Matching to Options**: As demonstrated by the variance in the candidate answers, the final and most crucial step is to carefully match the correct mathematical expression to the specific list of options provided in the problem statement, as this list can vary.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on an analysis of the provided candidate answers and a first-principles derivation, the following is a step-by-step resolution to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Analysis of Candidate Answers\n\nAll 15 candidate answers correctly perform the physics calculation and arrive at the exact same mathematical expression for the partition function: **Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)**.
