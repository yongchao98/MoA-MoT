Here, c is the speed of light. What will be the relative speed and the total energy of the system?\n\nA) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\nB) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\nC) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2\nD) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Calculation for Relative Speed (v_rel)**\n\nThe problem involves relativistic speeds, so the classical velocity subtraction is incorrect. The correct formula is the Lorentz velocity transformation for objects moving in the same direction:\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\nGiven:\n*   $v_1 = 0.6c$\n*   $v_2 = 0.5c$\n\nCalculation:\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7} = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.1428c$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, **v_rel ≈ 0.14c**.\n\nAll candidate answers correctly perform this calculation and arrive at the same numerical result.

The formula for a single particle's total energy is $E = \\gamma m_{rest} c^2$, where the Lorentz factor $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\n**Astronaut 1:**\n*   Mass: $m_1 = 2m$\n*   Velocity: $v_1 = 0.6c$\n*   Lorentz factor: $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n*   Energy: $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = (1.25)(2m)c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n**Astronaut 2:**\n*   Mass: $m_2 = 3m$\n*   Velocity: $v_2 = 0.5c$\n*   Lorentz factor: $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} \\approx 1.1547$\n*   Energy: $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 \\approx (1.1547)(3m)c^2 \\approx 3.464 mc^2$\n\n**Total Energy:**\n*   $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.464 mc^2 = 5.964 mc^2$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, **E_total ≈ 5.96 mc²**.\n\nAll candidate answers also correctly perform this calculation and arrive at the same numerical result.\n\n### **Step 3: Final Decision**\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   Relative speed: **0.14c**\n*   Total energy: **5.96 mc²**\n\nThese values correspond exactly to option D.\n\n**Careful Points and Analysis of Agent Answers:**\n*   All 15 agents correctly calculated the numerical values for both relative speed and total energy. This shows a strong consensus on the physics and mathematics involved.\n*   However, many agents selected the wrong letter (A, B, or C). This is likely due to an error in how they parsed or remembered the options provided in the prompt.\n*   The agents that correctly identified option D (e.g., Answer 1, Answer 5, Answer 11, Answer 15) have both the correct calculation and the correct mapping to the provided options.\n\nBased on the unanimous and correct calculation across all agents, and verifying this calculation against the provided options, the correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Goal**\nThe question requires the calculation of two distinct physical quantities for a system of two astronauts traveling at relativistic speeds:\n*   **Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$):** The speed of one astronaut as measured from the reference frame of the other.\n*   **Total Energy ($E_{total}$):** The sum of the total relativistic energies of both astronauts.\n\n### **2. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n#### **Part A: Calculating the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Since the speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light, we cannot use the simple Galilean subtraction of velocities (i.e., 0.6c - 0.5c). We must use the Lorentz transformation for velocities.\n*   **Formula:** For two objects moving in the same direction with velocities $v_1$ and $v_2$, the relative velocity is given by:\n    $v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n*   **Given Values:**\n    *   $v_1 = 0.6c$\n    *   $v_2 = 0.5c$\n*   **Calculation:**\n    $v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}$\n    $v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}}$\n    $v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3}$\n    $v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7} = \\frac{1}{7}c$\n    $v_{rel} \\approx 0.1428... c$\n*   **Result:** Rounded to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14c**.\n\n#### **Part B: Calculating the Total Energy of the System ($E_{total}$)**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The total energy of the system is the simple arithmetic sum of the individual *total relativistic energies* of each astronaut. The formula for a single particle's total energy is $E = \\gamma mc^2$.\n*   **Formula:**\n    *   Lorentz factor: $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$\n    *   Total system energy: $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = (\\gamma_1 m_1 c^2) + (\\gamma_2 m_2 c^2)$\n\n*   **Calculation for Astronaut 1:**\n    *   Mass $m_1 = 2m$, Velocity $v_1 = 0.6c$\n    *   $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n    *   $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = (1.25)(2m)c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n*   **Calculation for Astronaut 2:**\n    *   Mass $m_2 = 3m$, Velocity $v_2 = 0.5c$\n    *   $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}/2} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\approx 1.1547$\n    *   $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = (\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}})(3m)c^2 = 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2 \\approx 3.464 mc^2$\n\n*   **Calculation for Total System Energy:**\n    *   $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n    *   $E_{total} = (2.5 + 2\\sqrt{3}) mc^2 \\approx (2.5 + 3.464) mc^2 \\approx 5.964 mc^2$\n*   **Result:** Rounded to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96 mc²**.\n\n### **3. Conclusion and Final Decision**\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   Relative speed ($v_{rel}$) ≈ **0.14c**\n*   Total energy ($E_{total}$) ≈ **5.96 mc²**\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\nA) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\nB) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\nC) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\nD) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2\n\nThe calculated values perfectly match option D. An analysis of the candidate answers shows that while all of them performed the physics calculations correctly, many made a clerical error by matching the correct numerical result to the wrong letter option. The correct physics and the correct matching lead to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to verify the calculations for both the relative speed and the total energy of the system.\n\n1.  **Calculate the Relative Speed (v_rel):** Since the astronauts are moving at relativistic speeds, I will use the Lorentz velocity transformation formula for objects moving in the same direction: `v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)`. I will substitute `v1 = 0.6c` and `v2 = 0.5c` to find the relative speed.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Total Energy (E_total):** The total energy of the system is the sum of the individual relativistic energies of the two astronauts (`E_total = E1 + E2`). The relativistic energy for each astronaut is given by `E = γmc^2`, where `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is `1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)`.\n    *   First, I'll calculate the energy `E1` for the first astronaut (mass `2m`, speed `0.6c`).\n    *   Next, I'll calculate the energy `E2` for the second astronaut (mass `3m`, speed `0.5c`).\n    *   Finally, I'll add `E1` and `E2` to get the total energy of the system.\n\n3.  **Compare and Select the Answer:** I will compare my calculated values for `v_rel` and `E_total` with the given options to find the correct choice.

We must use the relativistic velocity transformation formula.\n*   **Formula:** For two objects moving in the same direction with velocities $v_1$ and $v_2$, the relative speed is given by:\n    $v_{rel} = \\frac{|v_1 - v_2|}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n*   **Given:**\n    *   $v_1 = 0.6c$\n    *   $v_2 = 0.5c$\n*   **Calculation:**\n    $v_{rel} = \\frac{|0.6c - 0.5c|}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}$\n    $v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}}$\n    $v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3}$\n    $v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7} = \\frac{1}{7}c$\n    $v_{rel} \\approx 0.1428... c$\n*   **Result:** Rounded to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14c**.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Total Energy of the System ($E_{total}$)**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The total energy of the system is the scalar sum of the total relativistic energies of each astronaut. The total energy of a single particle is not its rest energy ($m_0c^2$) but includes its kinetic energy.\n*   **Formula:** The total energy of a particle is $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$, where $m_0$ is the rest mass and $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$. The total energy of the system is $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$.\n*   **Calculation for Astronaut 1:**\n    *   Mass $m_1 = 2m$, Velocity $v_1 = 0.6c$\n    *   Lorentz factor $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n    *   Energy $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = (1.25)(2m)c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n*   **Calculation for Astronaut 2:**\n    *   Mass $m_2 = 3m$, Velocity $v_2 = 0.5c$\n    *   Lorentz factor $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}/2} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\approx 1.1547$\n    *   Energy $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = (\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}})(3m)c^2 = 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2 \\approx 3.464 mc^2$\n*   **Calculation for Total Energy:**\n    *   $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n    *   $E_{total} = (2.5 + 2\\sqrt{3}) mc^2 \\approx (2.5 + 3.464) mc^2 = 5.964 mc^2$\n*   **Result:** Rounded to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96 mc²**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe calculated relative speed is approximately **0.14c**, and the total energy is approximately **5.96 mc²**.

Analysis of the Physical Principles**\n\nThe problem involves two astronauts traveling at relativistic speeds (significant fractions of the speed of light, c). Therefore, the principles of special relativity must be used, not classical mechanics.\n\n*   **Relative Speed:** The classical formula for relative speed (simple subtraction) is incorrect. The correct formula is the relativistic velocity transformation (also known as the velocity subtraction formula for colinear motion).\n*   **Total Energy:** The energy of each astronaut is their total relativistic energy, which includes both their rest energy and kinetic energy.

Careful Points and Methodology**\n\n*   **Relative Speed:** Since the speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light, we cannot use simple subtraction. The correct method is to use the Lorentz velocity transformation formula for objects moving in the same direction:\n    `v_rel = (v_a - v_b) / (1 - (v_a * v_b) / c^2)`\n    The result will be the speed, which is the magnitude of the velocity, so the sign does not matter.\n\n*   **Total Energy:** The total energy of a particle moving at relativistic speed is not its rest energy (`mc^2`) but its total relativistic energy, which includes both rest energy and kinetic energy. The formula is:\n    `E = γmc^2`, where `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is `1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)`.\n    The total energy of the system is the simple scalar sum of the total energies of the two astronauts: `E_total = E1 + E2`.\n\n### **3.

We must calculate the total relativistic energy for each astronaut, which includes both rest energy and kinetic energy. The total energy of the system is the simple sum of the individual total energies of the two astronauts.\n\n### **2. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Step A: Calculate the Relative Speed (v_rel)**\n\nThe formula for the relative velocity of two objects (v₁ and v₂) moving in the same direction is:\n`v_rel = (v₁ - v₂) / (1 - (v₁ * v₂) / c²)`\n\nGiven:\n*   v₁ = 0.6c\n*   v₂ = 0.5c\n\nSubstitute the values:\n`v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3c²/c²)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7`\n`v_rel = (1/7)c ≈ 0.1428c`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, **v_rel ≈ 0.14c**.\n\n**Step B: Calculate the Total Energy of the System (E_total)**\n\nThe total energy of a relativistic particle is `E = γmc²`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor, `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`. The total energy of the system is `E_total = E₁ + E₂`.\n\n**For Astronaut 1:**\n*   Mass (m₁) = 2m\n*   Velocity (v₁) = 0.6c\n*   Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ₁):\n    `γ₁ = 1 / √(1 - (0.6)²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.36) = 1 / √(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25`\n*   Calculate the energy (E₁):\n    `E₁ = γ₁ * m₁ * c² = 1.25 * (2m) * c² = 2.5 mc²`\n\n**For Astronaut 2:**\n*   Mass (m₂) = 3m\n*   Velocity (v₂) = 0.5c\n*   Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ₂):\n    `γ₂ = 1 / √(1 - (0.5)²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.25) = 1 / √(0.75) ≈ 1.1547`\n*   Calculate the energy (E₂):\n    `E₂ = γ₂ * m₂ * c² ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c² ≈ 3.464 mc²`\n\n**Calculate the Total Energy (E_total):**\n*   `E_total = E₁ + E₂`\n*   `E_total ≈ 2.5 mc² + 3.464 mc²`\n*   `E_total ≈ 5.964 mc²`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, **E_total ≈ 5.96 mc²**.\n\n### **3. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   Relative speed `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`\n*   Total energy `E ≈ 5.96 mc²`\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n*   A) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\n*   B) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\n*   C) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2\n*   D) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\n\nThe calculated values perfectly match option C. The majority of the candidate answers performed the calculation correctly, even if some mislabeled the final option letter.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Problem**\n\nThe question requires the calculation of two distinct physical quantities for a system of two astronauts traveling at relativistic speeds:\n*   **Relative Speed (v_rel):** The speed of one astronaut as measured from the reference frame of the other.\n*   **Total Energy (E_total):** The sum of the individual total relativistic energies of the two astronauts.\n\n### **2. Calculation of Relative Speed (v_rel)**\n\n**Careful Point:** Since the speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light, the simple Galilean subtraction of velocities (`0.6c - 0.5c`) is incorrect. The Lorentz velocity transformation for objects moving in the same direction must be used.\n\n**Formula:**\nThe relative velocity `v_rel` between two objects with velocities `v1` and `v2` in a stationary frame is:\n`v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)`\n\n**Given:**\n*   `v1 = 0.6c`\n*   `v2 = 0.5c`\n\n**Calculation:**\n`v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3)`\n`v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7`\n`v_rel = (1/7)c ≈ 0.1428c`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14c**.\n\n### **3. Calculation of Total Energy (E_total)**\n\n**Careful Point:** The energy of a relativistic particle is its total energy (`E = γmc^2`), not just its rest energy (`mc^2`) or kinetic energy. The total energy of the system is the arithmetic sum of the total energies of each astronaut.\n\n**Formula:**\n*   Total energy of a particle: `E = γ * m_rest * c^2`\n*   Lorentz factor (γ): `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)`\n*   Total energy of the system: `E_total = E1 + E2`\n\n**Calculation for Astronaut 1:**\n*   Mass `m1 = 2m`, velocity `v1 = 0.6c`\n*   Lorentz factor `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.6^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25`\n*   Energy `E1 = γ1 * m1 * c^2 = 1.25 * (2m) * c^2 = 2.5 mc^2`\n\n**Calculation for Astronaut 2:**\n*   Mass `m2 = 3m`, velocity `v2 = 0.5c`\n*   Lorentz factor `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.5^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547`\n*   Energy `E2 = γ2 * m2 * c^2 ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c^2 ≈ 3.464 mc^2`\n\n**Calculation for Total System Energy:**\n*   `E_total = E1 + E2`\n*   `E_total = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.464 mc^2`\n*   `E_total = 5.964 mc^2`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96 mc²**.\n\n### **4. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   Relative speed `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`\n*   Total energy `E ≈ 5.96 mc^2`\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n*   A) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\n*   B) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2\n*   C) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\n*   D) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\n\nThe calculated values perfectly match option B.

We must use the relativistic velocity transformation formula.\n*   **Formula:** For two objects moving in the same direction with velocities $v_1$ and $v_2$, the relative speed is given by:\n    $v_{rel} = \\frac{|v_1 - v_2|}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n*   **Given:**\n    *   $v_1 = 0.6c$\n    *   $v_2 = 0.5c$\n*   **Calculation:**\n    $v_{rel} = \\frac{|0.6c - 0.5c|}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}$\n    $v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}}$\n    $v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3}$\n    $v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7} = \\frac{1}{7}c$\n    $v_{rel} \\approx 0.1428... c$\n*   **Result:** Rounded to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14c**.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Total Energy of the System ($E_{total}$)**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The total energy of the system is the scalar sum of the total relativistic energies of each astronaut. The total energy of a single particle is not its rest energy ($m_0c^2$) but includes its kinetic energy.\n*   **Formula:** The total energy of a particle is $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$, where $m_0$ is the rest mass and $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$. The total energy of the system is $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$.\n*   **Calculation for Astronaut 1:**\n    *   Mass $m_1 = 2m$, Velocity $v_1 = 0.6c$\n    *   Lorentz factor $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n    *   Energy $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = (1.25)(2m)c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n*   **Calculation for Astronaut 2:**\n    *   Mass $m_2 = 3m$, Velocity $v_2 = 0.5c$\n    *   Lorentz factor $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}/2} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\approx 1.1547$\n    *   Energy $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = (\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}})(3m)c^2 = 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2 \\approx 3.464 mc^2$\n*   **Calculation for Total Energy:**\n    *   $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n    *   $E_{total} = (2.5 + 2\\sqrt{3}) mc^2 \\approx (2.5 + 3.464) mc^2 = 5.964 mc^2$\n*   **Result:** Rounded to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96 mc²**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe calculated relative speed is approximately **0.14c**, and the total energy is approximately **5.96 mc²**.

Analysis of the Physical Principles**\n\nThe problem involves two astronauts traveling at relativistic speeds (significant fractions of the speed of light, c). Therefore, the principles of special relativity must be used, not classical mechanics.\n\n*   **Relative Speed:** The classical formula for relative speed (simple subtraction) is incorrect. The correct formula is the relativistic velocity transformation (also known as the velocity subtraction formula for colinear motion).\n*   **Total Energy:** The energy of each astronaut is their total relativistic energy, which includes both their rest energy and kinetic energy. The formula is E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor. The total energy of the system is the scalar sum of the individual energies of the two astronauts.\n\n### **2. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Step 2a: Calculate the Relative Speed (v_rel)**\n\nThe formula for the relative velocity between two objects moving in the same direction is:\n`v_rel = (v₁ - v₂) / (1 - (v₁ * v₂) / c²)`\n\nGiven:\n*   v₁ = 0.6c\n*   v₂ = 0.5c\n\nSubstitute the values:\n`v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7`\n`v_rel = (1/7)c ≈ 0.1428c`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, **v_rel ≈ 0.14c**.\n\n**Step 2b: Calculate the Total Energy of the System (E_total)**\n\nThe total energy is the sum of the individual energies: `E_total = E₁ + E₂`.\nThe energy for each astronaut is `E = γmc²`, with the Lorentz factor `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n**For Astronaut 1:**\n*   Mass m₁ = 2m\n*   Velocity v₁ = 0.6c\n*   Lorentz factor γ₁ = `1 / sqrt(1 - 0.6²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25`\n*   Energy E₁ = `γ₁ * m₁ * c² = 1.25 * (2m) * c² = 2.5 mc²`\n\n**For Astronaut 2:**\n*   Mass m₂ = 3m\n*   Velocity v₂ = 0.5c\n*   Lorentz factor γ₂ = `1 / sqrt(1 - 0.5²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547`\n*   Energy E₂ = `γ₂ * m₂ * c² ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c² ≈ 3.464 mc²`\n\n**Total Energy:**\n*   `E_total = E₁ + E₂ = 2.5 mc² + 3.464 mc² = 5.964 mc²`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, **E_total ≈ 5.96 mc²**.\n\n### **3.

Analysis of the Problem**\n\nThe question requires the calculation of two physical quantities for a system of two astronauts traveling at relativistic speeds:\n*   **Relative Speed (v_rel):** The speed of one astronaut as measured from the reference frame of the other.\n*   **Total Energy (E_total):** The sum of the individual total energies of the two astronauts.\n\n### **2. Careful Points and Methodology**\n\n*   **Relative Speed:** Since the speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light, we cannot use simple subtraction. The correct method is to use the Lorentz velocity transformation formula for objects moving in the same direction:\n    `v_rel = (v_a - v_b) / (1 - (v_a * v_b) / c^2)`\n    The result will be the speed, which is the magnitude of the velocity, so the sign does not matter.\n\n*   **Total Energy:** The total energy of a particle moving at relativistic speed is not its rest energy (`mc^2`) but its total relativistic energy, which includes both rest energy and kinetic energy. The formula is:\n    `E = γmc^2`, where `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is `1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)`.\n    The total energy of the system is the simple scalar sum of the total energies of the two astronauts: `E_total = E1 + E2`.\n\n### **3. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**A. Calculate the Relative Speed (v_rel)**\n\n*   Given velocities: `v1 = 0.6c` and `v2 = 0.5c`.\n*   Using the formula:\n    `v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2)`\n    `v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3)`\n    `v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7`\n    `v_rel = (1/7)c ≈ 0.1428c`\n*   Rounding to two decimal places, **v_rel ≈ 0.14c**.\n\n**B. Calculate the Total Energy (E_total)**\n\n*   **Astronaut 1 (mass = 2m, velocity = 0.6c):**\n    1.  Calculate the Lorentz factor (`γ1`):\n        `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.6^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25`\n    2.  Calculate the energy (`E1`):\n        `E1 = γ1 * (2m) * c^2 = 1.25 * 2mc^2 = 2.5 mc^2`\n\n*   **Astronaut 2 (mass = 3m, velocity = 0.5c):**\n    1.  Calculate the Lorentz factor (`γ2`):\n        `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.5^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547`\n    2.  Calculate the energy (`E2`):\n        `E2 = γ2 * (3m) * c^2 ≈ 1.1547 * 3mc^2 ≈ 3.464 mc^2`\n\n*   **Total System Energy:**\n    1.  Sum the individual energies:\n        `E_total = E1 + E2 ≈ 2.5 mc^2 + 3.464 mc^2 = 5.964 mc^2`\n*   Rounding to two decimal places, **E_total ≈ 5.96 mc^2**.\n\n### **4. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated values are `v_rel ≈ 0.14c` and `E_total ≈ 5.96 mc^2`. These results match the values presented in option D. A review of the candidate answers shows that while all of them performed the calculation correctly, some were confused by a different ordering of the A, B, C, D options.

To solve this, we must use the formulas from Einstein's theory of special relativity.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Calculating Relative Speed**\nWe cannot simply subtract the velocities (e.g., 0.6c - 0.5c). The Galilean transformation is not valid at these speeds. We must use the Lorentz velocity transformation formula for objects moving in the same direction.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Calculating Total Energy**\nThe energy of a moving object is not just its classical kinetic energy.
