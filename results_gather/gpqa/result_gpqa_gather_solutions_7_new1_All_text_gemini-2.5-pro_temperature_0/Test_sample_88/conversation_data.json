We are given specific spectroscopic data for Product 1. A robust analysis must account for this data rather than dismissing it.\n\n*   **Reaction:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane + excess KOH, 240°C → Product 1.\n*   **Data for Product 1:**\n    *   **IR:** 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates a ketone (C=O).\n    *   **¹H NMR:** Total integration is 2H + 10H + 2H = 14H. This means the product has the formula C₁₀H₁₄O.\n    *   **¹H NMR Signal at 4.79 ppm (2H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of vinylic protons on an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂).\n*   **Structural Deduction:** A molecule with the formula C₁₀H₁₄O has a degree of unsaturation of 4. The ketone (C=O) accounts for one degree, and the double bond (C=C) accounts for another. This leaves two degrees of unsaturation, which corresponds to a bicyclic structure. The adamantane (tricyclic) skeleton must have undergone a ring-opening rearrangement.\n*   **Conclusion for Product 1:** The structure that perfectly fits all the data is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. This is a known product of the Grob fragmentation of 1-bromo-3-hydroxyadamantane, an intermediate formed under the reaction conditions. This pathway is detailed in Answer 15 and is consistent with the data-driven approach of Answer 1.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) + excess aluminum isopropoxide → Product 2.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction selectively reduces ketones to alcohols while leaving C=C double bonds unaffected.\n*   **Conclusion for Product 2:** The ketone at C3 is reduced to an alcohol. Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol) + O₃; then DMS → Product 3.\n*   **Analysis:** This is an ozonolysis with a reductive workup. The reaction cleaves the C=C double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) is cleaved to form a ketone at C7 and formaldehyde (which is removed). The alcohol group at C3 is unaffected.\n*   **Conclusion for Product 3:** The final product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\nThe final task is to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton in Product 3.\n\n*   **Structure:** Product 3 is bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one. This molecule possesses a plane of symmetry passing through C3 and C7.\n*   **Most Deshielded Proton:** The proton attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-C3) is the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton. Its chemical shift is significantly downfield from protons alpha to the ketone or other aliphatic protons.\n*   **Coupling Analysis of H-C3:**\n    1.  The proton at C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4.\n    2.  Both C2 and C4 are methylene (CH₂) groups. Due to the molecule's symmetry, the C2 and C4 positions are chemically equivalent.\n    3.  Therefore, H-C3 is coupled to four neighboring protons. These four protons can be divided into two distinct sets based on their orientation (axial-like vs. equatorial-like).\n    4.  **Set 1:** The two axial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4) are equivalent to each other due to the plane of symmetry. Coupling to these two protons will split the H-C3 signal into a **triplet** (n=2, so n+1=3).\n    5.  **Set 2:** The two equatorial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4) are also equivalent to each other. The coupling constant to this set will be different from the coupling constant to the axial set. This second coupling will split each line of the first triplet into another **triplet**.\n*   **Final Pattern:** The resulting pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of Product 1**\n\nThe starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. It is subjected to harsh conditions: excess strong base (KOH) at a very high temperature (240°C). The problem provides crucial spectroscopic data for the resulting Product 1:\n*   **IR Spectrum:** An absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ strongly indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O), most likely a ketone.\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:** The spectrum shows signals at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H).\n    *   The total integration is 2 + 10 + 2 = 14 protons, which is the same number of protons as in the starting material. This implies the reaction is a rearrangement and substitution, with the formula C₁₀H₁₄O.\n    *   The signal at 4.79 ppm is highly characteristic of vinylic protons on an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂).\n\nA structure that perfectly fits all this data is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**.\n*   It has the correct formula, C₁₀H₁₄O.\n*   It contains a ketone in a six-membered ring, consistent with the IR peak.\n*   It has an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂), accounting for the 2H signal at 4.79 ppm.\n*   The formation of this bicyclic system from 1,3-dibromoadamantane under these conditions is chemically plausible via a rearrangement mechanism known as a Grob fragmentation.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n\nProduct 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide. This is the reagent for a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction selectively reduces the ketone functional group to an alcohol, leaving the carbon-carbon double bond unaffected.\n*   **Product 2 is 7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol.**\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n\nProduct 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS). This is a standard ozonolysis reaction with a reductive workup. The reaction cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) of Product 2 is cleaved.\n*   The cleavage converts the C7 carbon into a ketone (=O). The other part of the double bond becomes formaldehyde, which is removed during workup.\n*   The alcohol group at C3 is unaffected by the reaction.\n*   **Product 3 is bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one.**\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\nThe final task is to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded non-exchangeable hydrogen atom in Product 3, **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n1.  **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton:** In this molecule, the proton attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-C3) is the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton. Its proximity to the electronegative oxygen atom shifts its signal significantly downfield (typically 3.5-4.5 ppm), more so than the protons alpha to the ketone.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Coupling (Splitting) of H-C3:**\n    *   The bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane system exists in a rigid chair-chair conformation. The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C3 and C7.\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, which are C2 and C4. Both are methylene (-CH₂-) groups.\n    *   Therefore, H-C3 is coupled to a total of four neighboring protons.\n    *   Due to the molecule's symmetry, the two protons on C2 are equivalent in their coupling effect to the two protons on C4.\n    *   We can categorize the four neighboring protons into two sets based on their spatial relationship to H-C3:\n        *   **Set 1:** Two protons (one on C2, one on C4) that have one type of dihedral angle with H-C3 (e.g., axial-axial). These two protons are equivalent by symmetry and will have the same coupling constant, Jₐ.\n        *   **Set 2:** Two other protons (one on C2, one on C4) that have a different dihedral angle with H-C3 (e.g., axial-equatorial). These two protons are also equivalent by symmetry and will have the same coupling constant, Jₑ.\n    *   Typically, Jₐ is large (~10-13 Hz) and Jₑ is small (~2-5 Hz).\n    *   The signal for H-C3 is first split by the two equivalent protons of Set 1. According to the n+1 rule (where n=2), this gives a **triplet**.\n    *   Each peak of this triplet is then further split by the two equivalent protons of Set 2. This also gives a **triplet**.\n    *   The resulting overall pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer from the provided candidates.\n\n### **Step 1: Evaluate the Initial Reaction and Data for Product 1**\n\nThe problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacting with hot KOH. The product, **1**, has an IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ (ketone) and a ¹H NMR spectrum with signals at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H).\n\n*   **IR Data:** The 1720 cm⁻¹ peak confirms a ketone (C=O).\n*   **NMR Data:** The total proton count is 14, meaning the formula is C₁₀H₁₄O. The signal at 4.79 ppm is highly characteristic of vinylic protons on an exocyclic double bond (=CH₂).\n*   **Structural Deduction:** A molecule with formula C₁₀H₁₄O that contains both a ketone and a double bond must be bicyclic, not tricyclic like adamantane. The reaction must involve a skeletal rearrangement and fragmentation. The structure that perfectly fits all this data is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**, as correctly identified in Answer 15. This structure is a known product of the Grob fragmentation of 1,3-dihaloadamantanes.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n\nProduct 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is treated with aluminum isopropoxide. This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction selectively reduces the ketone to an alcohol and does not affect the double bond.\n\n*   **Product 2:** 7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n\nProduct 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS). This is a reductive ozonolysis, which cleaves the C=C double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) is cleaved to form a ketone (=O) at that position (C7). The alcohol group at C3 is unaffected.\n\n*   **Product 3:** bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\nThe final task is to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton in **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n1.  **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton:** In this molecule, the proton on the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-C3) is the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton. Its chemical shift (~3.5-4.5 ppm) is significantly higher than that of the protons alpha to the ketone (~2.5-3.0 ppm) or any other aliphatic protons.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Coupling Pattern:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule is highly symmetric, with a plane of symmetry passing through C3 and C7.\n    *   **Coupling Partners:** The proton at C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4. Both C2 and C4 are methylene (-CH₂-) groups.\n    *   **Equivalence:** Due to the molecule's symmetry, the two protons on C2 are in an equivalent environment to the two protons on C4. However, within each CH₂ group, the two protons (one axial-like, one equatorial-like) are not equivalent to each other.\n    *   **The Pattern:** The H-C3 proton is coupled to four neighboring protons in total. These four protons can be grouped into two pairs of symmetrically equivalent protons:\n        *   Pair 1: The two axial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n        *   Pair 2: The two equatorial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n    *   The coupling constant to the axial-like protons (J_ax) will be different from the coupling constant to the equatorial-like protons (J_eq).\n    *   According to the n+1 rule, coupling to the first pair of equivalent protons (n=2) splits the signal into a **triplet**. Each line of this triplet is then further split by the second pair of equivalent protons (n=2) into another **triplet**.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The resulting pattern is a **triplet of triplets**. This corresponds to option C.\n\n```python\n# Final Answer Selection\n# The problem describes a multi-step synthesis.\n# Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane -> Product 1.

The signal at 4.79 ppm (2H) is highly characteristic of vinylic protons on an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂).\n*   **Structural Deduction:** The formula C₁₀H₁₄O has four degrees of unsaturation. A ketone (=O) and a double bond (=C) account for two degrees. Therefore, the carbon skeleton must have two rings (bicyclic), not three like adamantane. This means the adamantane cage has undergone a rearrangement and ring-opening. A known reaction for 1,3-dihaloadamantanes under these conditions is a Grob fragmentation. The structure that perfectly fits all the data (bicyclic, ketone, exocyclic =CH₂, C₁₀H₁₄O) is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. This pathway correctly utilizes all the provided spectral information.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the formation and structure of Product 2\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction selectively reduces the ketone functional group to an alcohol. The carbon-carbon double bond is not affected.\n*   **Structure of Product 2:** The ketone at C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group. Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the formation and structure of Product 3\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard ozonolysis with a reductive workup. The reaction cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) is cleaved to form a ketone (=O) at the C7 position. The alcohol group at C3 is unaffected.\n*   **Structure of Product 3:** The final product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3\n\n*   **Question:** What is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding those that will exchange with deuterated solvent)?\n*   **Structure of Product 3:** bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one.\n*   **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton:** In this molecule, the proton attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-3) is the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton. Its chemical shift (~3.5-4.5 ppm) is significantly downfield from protons alpha to the ketone (~2.5 ppm) and other aliphatic protons.\n*   **Determine the Coupling Pattern:**\n    1.  **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a C₂ axis of symmetry that passes through the C3 and C7 atoms. This means the left and right sides of the molecule are chemically equivalent.\n    2.  **Neighbors of H-3:** The proton at C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4. Both C2 and C4 are methylene (-CH₂-) groups.\n    3.  **Coupling Equivalence:** Due to the C₂ symmetry, the coupling of H-3 to the two protons on C2 is identical to its coupling to the two protons on C4. The bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane ring system exists in a chair-chair conformation. This means H-3 is coupled to two equivalent axial-type protons (one on C2, one on C4) and two equivalent equatorial-type protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n    4.  **Splitting:** The signal for H-3 is split by two equivalent axial-type protons (n=2), resulting in a **triplet** (n+1=3). The coupling constant for this interaction (J_axial) is typically large. Each peak of this triplet is then further split by the two equivalent equatorial-type protons (n=2), resulting in another **triplet** (n+1=3). The coupling constant for this interaction (J_equatorial) is typically small.\n    5.  **Final Pattern:** The resulting pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\nThis analysis provides a clear and consistent path from the starting material and spectral data to one of the answer choices.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded proton.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Structure of Product 1\n\n1.  **Starting Material and Reagents:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C. This is a strong base at high temperature, suggesting elimination or rearrangement reactions.\n2.  **Spectroscopic Data for Product 1:**\n    *   **IR:** 1720 cm⁻¹. This is a characteristic absorption for a carbonyl group (C=O), likely a ketone in a six-membered ring.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** The spectrum shows signals at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H). The total proton count is 14, which means the formula is C₁₀H₁₄O (starting with C₁₀H₁₄Br₂, two Br are replaced by one O).\n3.  **Structural Interpretation:** The key piece of data is the signal at 4.79 ppm (2H). This chemical shift is typical for vinylic protons on an exocyclic double bond (=CH₂). A simple rearrangement to a saturated ketone like adamantanone or protoadamantanone would not produce any signals in this region. The reaction must therefore produce an unsaturated ketone. A known reaction for 1,3-dihaloadamantanes under these conditions is a Grob fragmentation, which opens the adamantane cage. This pathway leads to **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**.\n4.  **Consistency Check:** This structure is perfectly consistent with all the data:\n    *   It has the formula C₁₀H₁₄O.\n    *   It contains a ketone in a six-membered ring (IR at 1720 cm⁻¹).\n    *   It has an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂), accounting for the two vinylic protons at 4.79 ppm.\n    *   The remaining 12 protons belong to the bicyclic framework.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2\n\n1.  **Reaction:** Product 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide.\n2.  **Transformation:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction selectively reduces the ketone functional group to an alcohol. The carbon-carbon double bond is not affected.\n3.  **Product 2:** The structure is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3\n\n1.  **Reaction:** Product 2 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n2.  **Transformation:** This is a standard ozonolysis with a reductive workup. The reaction cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) is cleaved to form a ketone (=O) at that position (C7) and formaldehyde as a byproduct. The alcohol group at C3 is unaffected.\n3.  **Product 3:** The final product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3\n\n1.  **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton:** In Product 3 (bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one), we need to find the most deshielded proton, excluding the exchangeable alcohol proton (-OH). The proton attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-C3) is directly bonded to a carbon attached to an electronegative oxygen atom. Its chemical shift (typically 3.5-4.5 ppm) is significantly downfield compared to the protons alpha to the ketone (at C6 and C8, ~2.5-3.0 ppm) and all other aliphatic protons. Therefore, **H-C3 is the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton**.\n2.  **Determine the Coupling Pattern of H-C3:**\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C3 and C7. It exists in a stable chair-chair conformation.\n    *   The proton H-C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4. Both C2 and C4 are methylene (-CH₂-) groups.\n    *   H-C3 is coupled to a total of four neighboring protons.\n    *   Due to the molecule's symmetry, the two protons on C2 are equivalent in their coupling effect to the two protons on C4.\n    *   We can analyze the coupling of H-C3 to two sets of equivalent protons:\n        *   **Set 1:** The two axial-type protons (one on C2, one on C4). Let's call their coupling constant J_A.\n        *   **Set 2:** The two equatorial-type protons (one on C2, one on C4). Let's call their coupling constant J_B.\n    *   In the chair conformation, the coupling constant between axial-type protons (J_A) is large (typically 10-13 Hz), while the coupling constant between axial and equatorial-type protons (J_B) is small (typically 2-5 Hz).\n    *   Since J_A and J_B are different, the signal for H-C3 is split first by one pair of protons and then by the other.\n    *   Coupling to the two equivalent protons with the larger coupling constant (J_A) splits the signal into a **triplet** (n=2, so n+1=3).\n    *   Each peak of this triplet is then further split by the two equivalent protons with the smaller coupling constant (J_B), resulting in another **triplet**.\n    *   The final, overall pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the multi-step synthesis problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of Product 1**\n\n1.  **Starting Material & Reagents**: The reaction starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane and uses excess potassium hydroxide (KOH) at a high temperature (240°C).\n2.  **Spectroscopic Data**: Product 1 has an IR absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is characteristic of a ketone (C=O). The ¹H NMR spectrum shows signals at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H).\n3.  **Analysis**:\n    *   The total proton count from the NMR is 14, which means the formula is C₁₀H₁₄O (assuming the adamantane carbon skeleton is largely intact).\n    *   The signal at 4.79 ppm is in the vinylic region, indicating a C=C double bond with two protons, characteristic of an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂).\n    *   A molecule with the formula C₁₀H₁₄O that contains both a ketone and a double bond must have four degrees of unsaturation. The adamantane (tricyclic) skeleton has three degrees of unsaturation. To accommodate a ketone and a double bond (total of five degrees of unsaturation), the cage must have opened to become bicyclic (two degrees of unsaturation). A bicyclic skeleton (2) + a ketone (1) + a double bond (1) = 4 degrees of unsaturation, which matches the formula C₁₀H₁₄O.\n    *   The reaction of 1,3-dihaloadamantanes with a strong base is a known process called a Grob fragmentation, which leads to a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane derivative. The structure that perfectly matches all the data is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. This structure has the correct formula, a ketone in a six-membered ring, and an exocyclic methylene group.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n\n1.  **Reagents**: Product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide.\n2.  **Analysis**: This reagent is used for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which selectively reduces ketones to alcohols. The C=C double bond is not affected by this reagent.\n3.  **Structure**: The ketone group in 7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one is reduced to a hydroxyl group. Product 2 is therefore **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n\n1.  **Reagents**: Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n2.  **Analysis**: This is a reductive ozonolysis, which cleaves the C=C double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) of Product 2 is cleaved to form a ketone (=O) at that position (C7), while the alcohol group at C3 remains untouched.\n3.  **Structure**: The final product, Product 3, is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n1.  **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton**: In Product 3, the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton is the one attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-C3). Its chemical shift is typically higher than that of protons alpha to the ketone or other aliphatic protons.\n2.  **Determine the Coupling Pattern**:\n    *   **Symmetry**: The structure of bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one has a plane of symmetry that passes through C3 and C7.\n    *   **Neighbors**: The carbinol proton (H-C3) is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4. Both C2 and C4 are methylene (-CH₂-) groups.\n    *   **Equivalence**: Due to the plane of symmetry, the two protons on C2 are chemically equivalent to the two protons on C4. However, within each methylene group, the two protons (one axial-like, one equatorial-like) are not equivalent to each other. This means H-C3 is coupled to two sets of two equivalent protons: the two axial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4) and the two equatorial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n    *   **Splitting**: The signal for H-C3 is first split by the two equivalent axial-like protons into a **triplet** (according to the n+1 rule, where n=2). Each peak of this triplet is then further split by the two equivalent equatorial-like protons into another **triplet**. The coupling constants for these two interactions will be different (large for axial-axial, small for axial-equatorial).\n    *   **Final Pattern**: The resulting pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the multi-step reaction to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of Product 1**\n\nThe starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. It is heated with a strong base (KOH) at a high temperature. The provided data for the product (Product 1) is key:\n*   **IR Spectrum:** An absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of a ketone (C=O) functional group.\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:** The spectrum shows signals at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H). The total proton count is 14, the same as the starting material, implying a formula of C₁₀H₁₄O. The signal at 4.79 ppm is highly characteristic of vinylic protons on an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂).\n\nA structure with a C₁₀H₁₄O formula, a ketone, and a double bond cannot have the tricyclic adamantane skeleton (which would require a formula of C₁₀H₁₂O). This indicates that the adamantane cage has undergone a rearrangement and fragmentation to form a bicyclic structure.\n\nThe most plausible reaction is a Grob fragmentation. This leads to the formation of **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. This structure is fully consistent with all the provided data: it is a bicyclic ketone with an exocyclic methylene group and has the correct formula.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n\nProduct 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is heated with aluminum isopropoxide. This reagent performs a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which selectively reduces the ketone to an alcohol while leaving the C=C double bond unaffected. Therefore, Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n\nProduct 2 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethyl sulfide (DMS). This is a reductive ozonolysis reaction, which cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) is cleaved to form a ketone (=O) at that position (C7). The alcohol group at C3 is not affected by this reaction. The final product, Product 3, is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\nThe question asks for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in Product 3 (excluding the exchangeable alcohol proton).\n\n1.  **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton:** In bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one, the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton is the one attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-3). The electronegative oxygen atom deshields this proton significantly, placing its chemical shift around 3.5-4.5 ppm, which is further downfield than the protons alpha to the ketone.\n\n2.  **Determine the Coupling Environment:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C3, the C9 bridge, and C7. The carbinol proton (H-3) is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4. Both C2 and C4 are methylene (CH₂) groups.\n\n3.  **Predict the Splitting Pattern:**\n    *   H-3 is coupled to a total of four neighboring protons (two on C2 and two on C4).\n    *   Due to the molecule's symmetry, these four protons form two distinct sets of two equivalent protons.\n        *   **Set A:** The two axial-type protons (one on C2, one on C4) are equivalent to each other.\n        *   **Set B:** The two equatorial-type protons (one on C2, one on C4) are also equivalent to each other.\n    *   The coupling constant between H-3 and the protons in Set A (J_A) will be different from the coupling constant to the protons in Set B (J_B).\n    *   The coupling of H-3 to the two equivalent protons of Set A splits the signal into a **triplet** (n+1 = 2+1 = 3).\n    *   Each peak of this triplet is then further split by the two equivalent protons of Set B, also into a **triplet**.\n\nThe resulting overall pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the multi-step synthesis problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of Product 1**\n\n1.  **Starting Material and Reagents**: 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C. The adamantane cage is rigid, and standard elimination or substitution reactions are difficult. The harsh conditions (strong base, high temperature) are known to induce skeletal rearrangements.\n2.  **Spectroscopic Data**:\n    *   The IR spectrum shows an absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is characteristic of a ketone (C=O) functional group.\n    *   The ¹H NMR spectrum shows a total of 14 protons (2H + 10H + 2H), which means no protons were lost from the C₁₀H₁₄ core of adamantane. The formula of Product 1 is therefore C₁₀H₁₄O.\n    *   Crucially, there is a signal at 4.79 ppm for 2 protons. This chemical shift is typical for vinylic protons on an exocyclic double bond (=CH₂).\n3.  **Structural Deduction**: A saturated tricyclic ketone (an isomer of adamantanone) would have the formula C₁₀H₁₄O but would not have any vinylic protons. For a molecule to have both a C=C and a C=O group and still have 14 protons, the adamantane cage must have opened to form a bicyclic system. A bicyclic skeleton (2 degrees of unsaturation) with one C=C bond (1 degree) and one C=O bond (1 degree) has a total of 4 degrees of unsaturation, which corresponds to the formula C₁₀H₁₄O.\n4.  **Conclusion for Product 1**: The structure that perfectly fits all the evidence is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. This product results from a known fragmentation/rearrangement of adamantane derivatives. It is a bicyclic ketone with an exocyclic methylene group, accounting for all spectral data.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n\n1.  **Reaction**: Product 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is heated with aluminum isopropoxide.\n2.  **Transformation**: This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction selectively reduces the ketone functional group to an alcohol and does not affect the C=C double bond.\n3.  **Conclusion for Product 2**: The ketone at C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group. Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n\n1.  **Reaction**: Product 2 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n2.  **Transformation**: This is a standard ozonolysis with a reductive workup. The reaction cleaves the C=C double bond. The exocyclic =CH₂ group is cleaved to form a ketone at the C7 position of the ring, with formaldehyde as a byproduct. The alcohol group at C3 is unaffected.\n3.  **Conclusion for Product 3**: The final product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n1.  **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton**: In Product 3 (bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one), we must find the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton. The proton on the carbon bearing the alcohol group (the carbinol proton, H-C3) is directly attached to a carbon bonded to an electronegative oxygen atom. Its chemical shift (typically 3.5-4.5 ppm) is significantly downfield compared to other protons, such as those alpha to the ketone (~2.5 ppm). Therefore, H-C3 is the most deshielded proton.\n2.  **Determine the Coupling Pattern of H-C3**:\n    *   The bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane system exists in a stable chair-chair conformation. The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C3 and C7.\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4.\n    *   Both C2 and C4 are methylene (-CH₂) groups. Due to the molecule's symmetry, the two protons on C2 are equivalent in their coupling relationship to H-C3 as the two protons on C4.\n    *   In total, H-C3 is coupled to four neighboring protons. These four protons can be grouped into two sets of two equivalent protons: the two axial-type protons (one on C2, one on C4) and the two equatorial-type protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n    *   Coupling to the first pair of equivalent protons (e.g., the two axial-type protons) splits the H-C3 signal into a **triplet** (n=2, so n+1=3).\n    *   Each line of this triplet is then further split by the second pair of equivalent protons (the two equatorial-type protons) into another **triplet**.\n    *   The resulting pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded proton.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C.\n*   **Analysis of Product 1 Data:**\n    *   **IR Spectrum:** The absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a ketone (C=O), likely in a six-membered ring.\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum:** The signal at 4.79 ppm (2H) is highly indicative of vinylic protons on an exocyclic double bond (=CH₂). The total proton count (2H + 10H + 2H = 14H) matches the starting material, implying a formula of C₁₀H₁₄O.\n*   **Structural Deduction:** The harsh reaction conditions on the rigid 1,3-dihaloadamantane system are known to induce a skeletal rearrangement called a Grob fragmentation. This specific reaction is documented to produce **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. This structure perfectly accounts for all the provided spectral data: it is a C₁₀H₁₄O bicyclic compound with a ketone in one six-membered ring (IR at 1720 cm⁻¹) and an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) in the other (NMR at 4.79 ppm).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction selectively reduces ketones to alcohols while leaving carbon-carbon double bonds unaffected.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone at C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group, yielding **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by a reductive workup with dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard ozonolysis reaction. The ozonolysis cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) is cleaved to form a ketone (=O) at the C7 position. The alcohol group at C3 is unaffected.\n*   **Product 3:** The final product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n*   **Structure:** Product 3 is bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one. This molecule is highly symmetric, possessing a plane of symmetry that passes through the C3-OH bond, the C9 methylene bridge, and the C7=O bond.\n*   **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton:** The most deshielded non-exchangeable proton is the one attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-C3). This is due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the adjacent oxygen atom. Its chemical shift is typically in the 3.5-4.5 ppm range, which is more deshielded than the protons alpha to the ketone (~2.5-3.0 ppm).\n*   **Determine the Coupling Pattern of H-C3:**\n    1.  The proton at C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, which are C2 and C4.\n    2.  Both C2 and C4 are methylene (CH₂) groups. Therefore, H-C3 is coupled to a total of four neighboring protons.\n    3.  Due to the molecule's plane of symmetry, the two protons on C2 are in an equivalent environment to the two protons on C4.\n    4.  The four neighboring protons can be divided into two sets of two equivalent protons:\n        *   **Set A:** The two axial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n        *   **Set B:** The two equatorial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n    5.  The coupling constant between H-C3 and the two protons in Set A will be similar (J_A), and the coupling constant to the two protons in Set B will also be similar (J_B). Typically, the axial-axial coupling (J_A) is large, while the axial-equatorial coupling (J_B) is small.\n    6.  The signal for H-C3 is first split by the two equivalent protons of Set A into a **triplet** (n=2, so n+1=3).\n    7.

The provided data is crucial:\n*   **IR Spectrum:** An absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ strongly indicates a ketone (C=O) functional group, likely within a six-membered ring.\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:** The spectrum shows a total of 14 protons (2H + 10H + 2H), which means no protons were lost from the starting material's C₁₀H₁₄ core. The most telling signal is at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is characteristic of vinylic protons on an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂).\n\nA structure that contains a C₁₀ skeleton, a ketone, and an exocyclic double bond must be a bicyclic compound, not a tricyclic adamantane derivative. The reaction is a known, though complex, skeletal rearrangement, likely a Grob fragmentation of an intermediate. The structure that perfectly fits all the data is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. This structure has the correct formula (C₁₀H₁₄O), a ketone in a six-membered ring, and an exocyclic double bond. This interpretation, as seen in Answer 15, is the most faithful to the provided experimental data.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n\nProduct 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is heated with aluminum isopropoxide. This is the standard reagent for a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction selectively reduces the ketone to an alcohol without affecting the carbon-carbon double bond. Therefore, Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n\nProduct 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS). This is a reductive ozonolysis, which cleaves the C=C double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) of Product 2 is cleaved to form a ketone (=O) at that position (C7). The alcohol group at C3 is unaffected by this reaction. The final product, Product 3, is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\nThe question asks for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded non-exchangeable hydrogen atom in Product 3.\n\n1.  **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton:** In bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one, the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton is the one on the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-C3). Its chemical shift is typically in the 3.5-4.5 ppm range, which is significantly more deshielded than the protons alpha to the ketone (~2.5-3.0 ppm) or any other aliphatic protons.\n\n2.  **Determine the Coupling Pattern:** To find the splitting pattern of H-C3, we must identify its neighboring protons.\n    *   **Symmetry:** Product 3 is a highly symmetric molecule, possessing a plane of symmetry that passes through C3 and C7.\n    *   **Neighbors:** The proton at C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4. Both C2 and C4 are methylene (CH₂) groups. Therefore, H-C3 is coupled to a total of four neighboring protons.\n    *   **Equivalence:** Due to the molecule's symmetry, the coupling of H-C3 to the two protons on C2 is identical to its coupling to the two protons on C4. However, within each CH₂ group, the two protons (one axial-like, one equatorial-like) are not equivalent to each other.\n    *   Let's denote the coupling constant between H-C3 and the two equivalent axial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4) as J_A.\n    *   Let's denote the coupling constant between H-C3 and the two equivalent equatorial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4) as J_B.\n    *   Typically, in a chair conformation, J_A (axial-axial type) is large, while J_B (axial-equatorial type) is small.\n    *   **Splitting:** The signal for H-C3 is first split by the two equivalent protons with coupling J_A.

This second splitting also produces a **triplet**.\n\nThe resulting overall pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the most logical points from the candidate answers to arrive at a final conclusion.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of Product 1**\n\nThis is the most critical step, as there is an apparent contradiction in the provided information that must be resolved.\n\n*   **Reaction:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane + excess KOH, 240°C → Product 1.\n*   **Spectroscopic Data for Product 1:**\n    *   IR: 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates a ketone (C=O).\n    *   ¹H NMR: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), 1.94 ppm (2H).\n*   **Analysis of Data:**\n    1.  The total proton count is 2 + 10 + 2 = 14. This means the molecular formula is C₁₀H₁₄O.\n    2.  The signal at 4.79 ppm is highly characteristic of vinylic protons, specifically an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂).\n    3.  The subsequent reaction is ozonolysis, which requires a C=C double bond. This confirms the presence of an alkene.\n*   **Reconciling the Data:** A molecule with the formula C₁₀H₁₄O that contains both a ketone and a double bond cannot be a tricyclic adamantane derivative (which would require a formula of C₁₀H₁₂O). The reaction must involve a skeletal rearrangement that opens the adamantane cage. The reaction of 1,3-dihaloadamantanes with a strong base is known to cause a Grob fragmentation.\n*   **Conclusion for Product 1:** The structure that perfectly fits all the provided data is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. This structure has the correct formula (C₁₀H₁₄O), a ketone in a six-membered ring (consistent with the IR), and an exocyclic methylene group (consistent with the NMR). This approach, as taken by Answer 15, is superior to those that dismiss the provided NMR data as erroneous.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction is highly selective for reducing aldehydes and ketones to alcohols and will not affect the carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Conclusion for Product 2:** The ketone at position C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group. Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard ozonolysis with a reductive workup. The reaction cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) is cleaved to form a ketone (=O) at position C7. The alcohol group at C3 remains unchanged.\n*   **Conclusion for Product 3:** The final product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n*   **Question:** What is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding those that will exchange with deuterated solvent)?\n*   **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton:** In Product 3 (bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one), the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton is the one attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-C3). The electronegative oxygen atom deshields this proton, placing its signal significantly downfield from the other protons on the carbon skeleton.\n*   **Determine the Coupling Pattern:**\n    1.  The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C3 and C7.\n    2.  The proton at C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4.\n    3.  Both C2 and C4 are methylene groups (-CH₂-), so H-C3 is coupled to a total of four neighboring protons.\n    4.  Due to the molecule's symmetry and its stable chair-chair conformation, the four neighboring protons can be grouped into two distinct pairs of equivalent protons:\n        *   Two equivalent axial-type protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n        *   Two equivalent equatorial-type protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n    5.  The coupling of H-C3 to the two equivalent axial-type protons (with coupling constant J_ax) splits the signal into a **triplet** (n+1 = 2+1 = 3).\n    6.  Each peak of this triplet is then further split by the two equivalent equatorial-type protons (with a different coupling constant J_eq), resulting in another **triplet**.\n    7.  Therefore, the overall coupling pattern for the most deshielded proton (H-C3) is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of Product 1**\n\nThe first step is to identify Product 1, formed from the reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. This is the most critical step, as it dictates the rest of the synthesis.\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C₁₀H₁₄Br₂).\n*   **Provided Data for Product 1:**\n    *   IR spectrum: 1720 cm⁻¹. This is a strong indicator of a ketone (C=O) functional group.\n    *   ¹H NMR spectrum: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), 1.94 ppm (2H). The total integration is 14 protons, meaning the formula is C₁₀H₁₄O. The signal at 4.79 ppm is highly characteristic of vinylic protons on an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂).\n*   **Structural Deduction:** A molecule with the formula C₁₀H₁₄O has four degrees of unsaturation. The adamantane skeleton is tricyclic (3 degrees). A ketone adds one more degree, for a total of four. This would describe a saturated ketone like adamantanone. However, the NMR data clearly shows a C=C double bond, which would add a fifth degree of unsaturation. This is a contradiction.\n*   **Resolving the Contradiction:** As pointed out in several answers (e.g., Answer 8, Answer 15), the only way for a C₁₀H₁₄O molecule to contain both a ketone (1 DoU) and a double bond (1 DoU) is if the carbon skeleton is bicyclic (2 DoU), for a total of 2+1+1 = 4 degrees of unsaturation. This means the adamantane cage must have opened during the reaction.\n*   **Most Plausible Structure:** The reaction of 1,3-dihaloadamantanes under these conditions can proceed via a Grob fragmentation. This mechanism leads to **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. This structure, as identified in **Answer 15**, perfectly matches all the provided data for Product 1. Many other answers ignore this crucial NMR data and propose other structures like protoadamantanone or adamantanone, which is a less rigorous approach.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n\nProduct 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is heated with aluminum isopropoxide.\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction selectively reduces ketones to alcohols and does not affect C=C double bonds.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone at C3 is reduced to an alcohol. Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**. This is consistent with the analysis in **Answer 15**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n\nProduct 2 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is a reductive ozonolysis, which cleaves the C=C double bond.\n*   **Transformation:** The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) at C7 is cleaved to form a ketone (=O) at that position. The alcohol group at C3 is unaffected.\n*   **Product 3:** The final product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**. This is consistent with the analysis in **Answer 15**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\nThe final task is to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton in Product 3 (bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one).\n\n1.  **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton:** In this keto-alcohol, the proton on the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-C3) is the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton. It is directly attached to a carbon bonded to an electronegative oxygen atom.\n2.  **Analyze the Coupling (Splitting):**\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry (Cₛ) passing through C3 and C7.\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4.\n    *   C2 and C4 are both methylene (-CH₂-) groups. Due to the symmetry, the protons on C2 are equivalent to the protons on C4.\n    *   Therefore, H-C3 is coupled to a total of four neighboring protons. These four protons exist as two distinct pairs of equivalent protons:\n        *   Pair 1: The two axial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n        *   Pair 2: The two equatorial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n    *   The coupling constant to the first pair (J_A) will be different from the coupling constant to the second pair (J_B).\n    *   According to the n+1 rule, coupling to the first pair of equivalent protons (n=2) splits the signal into a **triplet**.\n    *   Each line of this triplet is then further split by the second pair of equivalent protons (n=2) into another **triplet**.\n3.  **Conclusion:** The resulting pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\nThis conclusion is reached in the reasoning of multiple answers (2, 3, 4, 6, 11, 15), although some arrive there via a different, less likely chemical pathway. The pathway and analysis detailed in Answer 15 are the most consistent with all the information provided in the problem.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the multi-step synthesis problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of Product 1**\n\nThe first step is to identify the structure of Product 1, formed from 1,3-dibromoadamantane with hot KOH. The provided data is crucial:\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C₁₀H₁₄Br₂).\n*   **Product 1 Data:**\n    *   **IR Spectrum:** 1720 cm⁻¹. This is a strong indicator of a ketone (C=O) functional group, likely within a six-membered ring.\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum:** The total integration is 14 protons (2H + 10H + 2H), which means no carbons or hydrogens have been lost. The formula must be C₁₀H₁₄O.\n    *   **¹H NMR Chemical Shift:** A signal at 4.79 ppm (2H) is highly characteristic of vinylic protons on an exocyclic double bond (=CH₂).\n\nThere is an apparent contradiction: a saturated tricyclic ketone (like an adamantanone isomer) would have the formula C₁₀H₁₄O, but it would not have a C=C double bond. An unsaturated ketone would have a C=C bond, but its formula would be C₁₀H₁₂O. The only way to satisfy all conditions (formula C₁₀H₁₄O, a ketone, and a double bond) is if the tricyclic adamantane cage has opened to form a bicyclic structure.\n\nThe structure that perfectly fits all the data is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**.\n*   It is a bicyclic molecule.\n*   Its formula is C₁₀H₁₄O.\n*   It contains a ketone in a six-membered ring (consistent with the IR peak).\n*   It has an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂), which accounts for the ¹H NMR signal at 4.79 ppm (2H).\nThis structure is a known product of the Grob fragmentation of a 1-bromo-3-hydroxyadamantane intermediate, which is a plausible reaction pathway under the given conditions. This analysis, as detailed in candidate answer 15, is the most consistent with the provided experimental data.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n\nProduct 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is heated with aluminum isopropoxide. This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which selectively reduces the ketone to an alcohol. The C=C double bond is unaffected.\n*   **Product 2 is 7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol.**\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n\nProduct 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS). This is a reductive ozonolysis, which cleaves the C=C double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) is cleaved to form a ketone (=O) at that position (C7), while the alcohol group at C3 remains unchanged.\n*   **Product 3 is bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one.**\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\nThe final task is to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton in Product 3 (bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one).\n\n1.  **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton:** In this molecule, the proton attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-C3) is the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton. Its chemical shift is typically in the 3.5-4.5 ppm range, which is further downfield than the protons alpha to the ketone or any other aliphatic protons.\n\n2.  **Determine the Coupling Pattern:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry passing through C3, C9, and C7. This makes the two six-membered rings equivalent.\n    *   **Neighboring Protons:** The proton at C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4. Each of these is a methylene (-CH₂-) group, so H-C3 is coupled to a total of four neighboring protons.\n    *   **Equivalence:** Due to the molecule's symmetry, the two protons on C2 are equivalent by reflection to the two protons on C4. However, within each CH₂ group, the axial and equatorial protons are different. Therefore, H-C3 is coupled to two equivalent axial-type protons (one on C2, one on C4) and two equivalent equatorial-type protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n    *   **Splitting:** A proton coupled to two sets of two equivalent protons will exhibit a \"triplet of triplets\" pattern. The signal is first split into a triplet by one pair of equivalent protons, and each line of that triplet is further split into another triplet by the second pair of equivalent protons.\n\nTherefore, the coupling pattern for the most deshielded hydrogen atom in Product 3 is a triplet of triplets.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the multi-step synthesis problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of Product 1**\n\n1.  **Reaction:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C. The adamantane cage is very rigid, and reactions at the bridgehead positions are unusual. Standard elimination (E2) is forbidden by Bredt's rule, and substitution (S_N1/S_N2) is extremely slow. The harsh conditions (strong base, high temperature) strongly suggest a skeletal rearrangement.\n2.  **Spectroscopic Data:**\n    *   **IR Spectrum:** A peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a definitive indicator of a ketone (C=O) functional group, likely within a six-membered ring.\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum:** The spectrum shows signals at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H).\n3.  **Analysis and Reconciliation:**\n    *   The total proton count is 14, matching the starting material (C₁₀H₁₄Br₂). The reaction likely involves the replacement of 2 Br atoms with one oxygen, giving a formula of C₁₀H₁₄O.\n    *   The signal at 4.79 ppm is in the characteristic region for vinylic protons, and the integration of 2H strongly suggests an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂).\n    *   A molecule with the formula C₁₀H₁₄O has four degrees of unsaturation. If it contains one ketone (C=O, 1 DoU) and one double bond (C=C, 1 DoU), the carbon skeleton must account for the remaining two degrees of unsaturation, which implies a **bicyclic** structure.\n    *   The reaction, therefore, involves a fragmentation of the tricyclic adamantane cage into a bicyclic system. A known reaction under these conditions is a Grob fragmentation, which leads to **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. This structure perfectly matches all the provided data: it is a bicyclic ketone with an exocyclic methylene group.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n\n1.  **Reaction:** Product 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is heated with aluminum isopropoxide.\n2.  **Analysis:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction is highly selective for reducing aldehydes and ketones to their corresponding alcohols and does not affect carbon-carbon double bonds.\n3.  **Product 2:** The ketone group at C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group. Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n\n1.  **Reaction:** Product 2 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by a reductive workup with dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n2.  **Analysis:** This is a standard ozonolysis reaction. The ozone cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) is converted into a ketone (=O) at C7, with formaldehyde as a byproduct. The alcohol group at C3 is unaffected.\n3.  **Product 3:** The final product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n1.  **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton:** In Product 3 (bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one), we must find the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton. The proton attached to the carbon bearing the alcohol group (the carbinol proton, H-C3) is directly bonded to a carbon attached to an electronegative oxygen atom. Its chemical shift (~3.5-4.5 ppm) is typically significantly downfield compared to protons alpha to the ketone (~2.5-3.0 ppm) or other aliphatic protons. Therefore, **H-C3 is the most deshielded proton**.\n2.  **Determine the Coupling Pattern of H-C3:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C3 and C7.\n    *   **Neighbors:** The proton at C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4. Both C2 and C4 are methylene (-CH₂-) groups.\n    *   **Conformation:** The bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane system exists in a stable chair-chair conformation.\n    *   **Coupling Analysis:** H-C3 is coupled to a total of four neighboring protons. Due to the molecule's symmetry, these four protons form two distinct pairs of chemically equivalent protons:\n        *   **Pair 1:** The two axial-type protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n        *   **Pair 2:** The two equatorial-type protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n    *   The coupling constant between H-C3 and the two axial-type protons (J_ax) will be different from the coupling constant to the two equatorial-type protons (J_eq). Typically, J_ax is large (~10-13 Hz) and J_eq is small (~2-5 Hz).\n    *   **Resulting Pattern:** The signal for H-C3 is first split by the two equivalent axial-type protons into a **triplet** (n=2, so n+1=3). Each peak of this triplet is then further split by the two equivalent equatorial-type protons into another **triplet**. The final, observable pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded proton.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of Product 1**\n\n1.  **Starting Material and Reagents**: 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C. The adamantane cage is tricyclic, and the bromines are at bridgehead positions.\n2.  **Spectroscopic Data for Product 1**:\n    *   IR spectrum: An absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a ketone (C=O) functional group, typically in a six-membered ring.\n    *   ¹H NMR spectrum: The total integration is 14 protons (2H + 10H + 2H), which means no carbons or hydrogens have been lost. The formula is C₁₀H₁₄O. The signal at 4.79 ppm (2H) is highly indicative of vinylic protons on an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂).\n3.  **Structural Deduction**:\n    *   The degree of unsaturation for C₁₀H₁₄O is (2*10 + 2 - 14)/2 = 4.\n    *   A ketone (C=O) accounts for one degree of unsaturation. A double bond (C=C) accounts for another. This leaves two degrees of unsaturation to be accounted for by rings. Therefore, the product must be bicyclic.\n    *   The harsh reaction conditions (strong base, high temperature) on 1,3-dihaloadamantanes are known to cause a skeletal rearrangement, often via a Grob fragmentation, to form a bicyclic system.\n    *   The structure that perfectly fits all the data is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. This molecule is bicyclic, contains a ketone in a six-membered ring, and has an exocyclic methylene group.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n\n1.  **Reaction**: Product 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide.\n2.  **Analysis**: This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction selectively reduces ketones and aldehydes to their corresponding alcohols. It does not affect carbon-carbon double bonds.\n3.  **Structure of Product 2**: The ketone group at C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group. Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n\n1.  **Reaction**: Product 2 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n2.  **Analysis**: This is a reductive ozonolysis. This reaction cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) is cleaved to form a ketone at that position (C7) and formaldehyde (which is removed during workup). The alcohol group at C3 is unaffected.\n3.  **Structure of Product 3**: The final product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n1.  **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton**: In Product 3 (bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one), we need to find the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton. The proton on the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-C3) is directly attached to a carbon bonded to an electronegative oxygen atom. This makes it the most deshielded C-H proton, with a typical chemical shift of 3.5-4.5 ppm. Protons alpha to the ketone (at C6 and C8) are less deshielded.\n2.  **Determine the Coupling Pattern**:\n    *   The structure of Product 3 has a plane of symmetry passing through C3 and C7. The molecule exists in a stable chair-chair conformation.\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4.\n    *   Both C2 and C4 are methylene (-CH₂-) groups. Therefore, H-C3 is coupled to a total of four neighboring protons.\n    *   Due to the molecule's symmetry, the coupling of H-C3 to the two protons on C2 is identical to its coupling to the two protons on C4.\n    *   Let's consider the protons on one side, for example, C2. It has an axial proton (H2ax) and an equatorial proton (H2eq). H-C3 will have a large coupling constant (J_ax) to the two equivalent axial-type protons (H2ax and H4ax) and a small coupling constant (J_eq) to the two equivalent equatorial-type protons (H2eq and H4eq).\n    *   The signal for H-C3 is first split by the two equivalent axial-type protons.

We are given specific spectroscopic data for Product 1. A robust analysis must account for this data rather than dismissing it.\n\n*   **Reaction:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane + excess KOH, 240°C → Product 1.\n*   **Data for Product 1:**\n    *   **IR:** 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates a ketone (C=O).\n    *   **¹H NMR:** Total integration is 2H + 10H + 2H = 14H.

The ketone (C=O) accounts for one degree, and the double bond (C=C) accounts for another. This leaves two degrees of unsaturation, which corresponds to a bicyclic structure. The adamantane (tricyclic) skeleton must have undergone a ring-opening rearrangement.\n*   **Conclusion for Product 1:** The structure that perfectly fits all the data is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. This is a known product of the Grob fragmentation of 1-bromo-3-hydroxyadamantane, an intermediate formed under the reaction conditions. This pathway is detailed in Answer 15 and is consistent with the data-driven approach of Answer 1.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) + excess aluminum isopropoxide → Product 2.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction selectively reduces ketones to alcohols while leaving C=C double bonds unaffected.\n*   **Conclusion for Product 2:** The ketone at C3 is reduced to an alcohol.

The reaction cleaves the C=C double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) is cleaved to form a ketone at C7 and formaldehyde (which is removed). The alcohol group at C3 is unaffected.\n*   **Conclusion for Product 3:** The final product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\nThe final task is to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton in Product 3.\n\n*   **Structure:** Product 3 is bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one. This molecule possesses a plane of symmetry passing through C3 and C7.\n*   **Most Deshielded Proton:** The proton attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-C3) is the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton. Its chemical shift is significantly downfield from protons alpha to the ketone or other aliphatic protons.\n*   **Coupling Analysis of H-C3:**\n    1.  The proton at C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4.\n    2.  Both C2 and C4 are methylene (CH₂) groups. Due to the molecule's symmetry, the C2 and C4 positions are chemically equivalent.\n    3.  Therefore, H-C3 is coupled to four neighboring protons. These four protons can be divided into two distinct sets based on their orientation (axial-like vs. equatorial-like).\n    4.  **Set 1:** The two axial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4) are equivalent to each other due to the plane of symmetry. Coupling to these two protons will split the H-C3 signal into a **triplet** (n=2, so n+1=3).\n    5.  **Set 2:** The two equatorial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4) are also equivalent to each other. The coupling constant to this set will be different from the coupling constant to the axial set. This second coupling will split each line of the first triplet into another **triplet**.\n*   **Final Pattern:** The resulting pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of Product 1**\n\nThe starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. It is subjected to harsh conditions: excess strong base (KOH) at a very high temperature (240°C). The problem provides crucial spectroscopic data for the resulting Product 1:\n*   **IR Spectrum:** An absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ strongly indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O), most likely a ketone.\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:** The spectrum shows signals at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H).\n    *   The total integration is 2 + 10 + 2 = 14 protons, which is the same number of protons as in the starting material. This implies the reaction is a rearrangement and substitution, with the formula C₁₀H₁₄O.\n    *   The signal at 4.79 ppm is highly characteristic of vinylic protons on an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂).\n\nA structure that perfectly fits all this data is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**.\n*   It has the correct formula, C₁₀H₁₄O.\n*   It contains a ketone in a six-membered ring, consistent with the IR peak.\n*   It has an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂), accounting for the 2H signal at 4.79 ppm.\n*   The formation of this bicyclic system from 1,3-dibromoadamantane under these conditions is chemically plausible via a rearrangement mechanism known as a Grob fragmentation.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n\nProduct 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide. This is the reagent for a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction selectively reduces the ketone functional group to an alcohol, leaving the carbon-carbon double bond unaffected.\n*   **Product 2 is 7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol.**\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n\nProduct 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS). This is a standard ozonolysis reaction with a reductive workup. The reaction cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) of Product 2 is cleaved.\n*   The cleavage converts the C7 carbon into a ketone (=O). The other part of the double bond becomes formaldehyde, which is removed during workup.\n*   The alcohol group at C3 is unaffected by the reaction.\n*   **Product 3 is bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one.**\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\nThe final task is to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded non-exchangeable hydrogen atom in Product 3, **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n1.  **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton:** In this molecule, the proton attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-C3) is the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton. Its proximity to the electronegative oxygen atom shifts its signal significantly downfield (typically 3.5-4.5 ppm), more so than the protons alpha to the ketone.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Coupling (Splitting) of H-C3:**\n    *   The bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane system exists in a rigid chair-chair conformation. The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C3 and C7.\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, which are C2 and C4. Both are methylene (-CH₂-) groups.\n    *   Therefore, H-C3 is coupled to a total of four neighboring protons.\n    *   Due to the molecule's symmetry, the two protons on C2 are equivalent in their coupling effect to the two protons on C4.\n    *   We can categorize the four neighboring protons into two sets based on their spatial relationship to H-C3:\n        *   **Set 1:** Two protons (one on C2, one on C4) that have one type of dihedral angle with H-C3 (e.g., axial-axial). These two protons are equivalent by symmetry and will have the same coupling constant, Jₐ.\n        *   **Set 2:** Two other protons (one on C2, one on C4) that have a different dihedral angle with H-C3 (e.g., axial-equatorial). These two protons are also equivalent by symmetry and will have the same coupling constant, Jₑ.\n    *   Typically, Jₐ is large (~10-13 Hz) and Jₑ is small (~2-5 Hz).\n    *   The signal for H-C3 is first split by the two equivalent protons of Set 1. According to the n+1 rule (where n=2), this gives a **triplet**.\n    *   Each peak of this triplet is then further split by the two equivalent protons of Set 2. This also gives a **triplet**.\n    *   The resulting overall pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer from the provided candidates.\n\n### **Step 1: Evaluate the Initial Reaction and Data for Product 1**\n\nThe problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacting with hot KOH. The product, **1**, has an IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ (ketone) and a ¹H NMR spectrum with signals at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H).\n\n*   **IR Data:** The 1720 cm⁻¹ peak confirms a ketone (C=O).\n*   **NMR Data:** The total proton count is 14, meaning the formula is C₁₀H₁₄O. The signal at 4.79 ppm is highly characteristic of vinylic protons on an exocyclic double bond (=CH₂).\n*   **Structural Deduction:** A molecule with formula C₁₀H₁₄O that contains both a ketone and a double bond must be bicyclic, not tricyclic like adamantane. The reaction must involve a skeletal rearrangement and fragmentation. The structure that perfectly fits all this data is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**, as correctly identified in Answer 15. This structure is a known product of the Grob fragmentation of 1,3-dihaloadamantanes.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n\nProduct 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is treated with aluminum isopropoxide. This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction selectively reduces the ketone to an alcohol and does not affect the double bond.\n\n*   **Product 2:** 7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n\nProduct 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS). This is a reductive ozonolysis, which cleaves the C=C double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) is cleaved to form a ketone (=O) at that position (C7). The alcohol group at C3 is unaffected.\n\n*   **Product 3:** bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\nThe final task is to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton in **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n1.  **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton:** In this molecule, the proton on the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-C3) is the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton. Its chemical shift (~3.5-4.5 ppm) is significantly higher than that of the protons alpha to the ketone (~2.5-3.0 ppm) or any other aliphatic protons.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Coupling Pattern:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule is highly symmetric, with a plane of symmetry passing through C3 and C7.\n    *   **Coupling Partners:** The proton at C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4. Both C2 and C4 are methylene (-CH₂-) groups.\n    *   **Equivalence:** Due to the molecule's symmetry, the two protons on C2 are in an equivalent environment to the two protons on C4. However, within each CH₂ group, the two protons (one axial-like, one equatorial-like) are not equivalent to each other.\n    *   **The Pattern:** The H-C3 proton is coupled to four neighboring protons in total. These four protons can be grouped into two pairs of symmetrically equivalent protons:\n        *   Pair 1: The two axial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n        *   Pair 2: The two equatorial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n    *   The coupling constant to the axial-like protons (J_ax) will be different from the coupling constant to the equatorial-like protons (J_eq).\n    *   According to the n+1 rule, coupling to the first pair of equivalent protons (n=2) splits the signal into a **triplet**. Each line of this triplet is then further split by the second pair of equivalent protons (n=2) into another **triplet**.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The resulting pattern is a **triplet of triplets**. This corresponds to option C.\n\n```python\n# Final Answer Selection\n# The problem describes a multi-step synthesis.\n# Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane -> Product 1.

The signal at 4.79 ppm (2H) is highly characteristic of vinylic protons on an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂).\n*   **Structural Deduction:** The formula C₁₀H₁₄O has four degrees of unsaturation. A ketone (=O) and a double bond (=C) account for two degrees. Therefore, the carbon skeleton must have two rings (bicyclic), not three like adamantane. This means the adamantane cage has undergone a rearrangement and ring-opening. A known reaction for 1,3-dihaloadamantanes under these conditions is a Grob fragmentation. The structure that perfectly fits all the data (bicyclic, ketone, exocyclic =CH₂, C₁₀H₁₄O) is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. This pathway correctly utilizes all the provided spectral information.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the formation and structure of Product 2\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction selectively reduces the ketone functional group to an alcohol. The carbon-carbon double bond is not affected.\n*   **Structure of Product 2:** The ketone at C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group. Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the formation and structure of Product 3\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard ozonolysis with a reductive workup. The reaction cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) is cleaved to form a ketone (=O) at the C7 position. The alcohol group at C3 is unaffected.\n*   **Structure of Product 3:** The final product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3\n\n*   **Question:** What is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding those that will exchange with deuterated solvent)?\n*   **Structure of Product 3:** bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one.\n*   **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton:** In this molecule, the proton attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-3) is the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton. Its chemical shift (~3.5-4.5 ppm) is significantly downfield from protons alpha to the ketone (~2.5 ppm) and other aliphatic protons.\n*   **Determine the Coupling Pattern:**\n    1.  **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a C₂ axis of symmetry that passes through the C3 and C7 atoms. This means the left and right sides of the molecule are chemically equivalent.\n    2.  **Neighbors of H-3:** The proton at C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4. Both C2 and C4 are methylene (-CH₂-) groups.\n    3.  **Coupling Equivalence:** Due to the C₂ symmetry, the coupling of H-3 to the two protons on C2 is identical to its coupling to the two protons on C4. The bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane ring system exists in a chair-chair conformation. This means H-3 is coupled to two equivalent axial-type protons (one on C2, one on C4) and two equivalent equatorial-type protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n    4.  **Splitting:** The signal for H-3 is split by two equivalent axial-type protons (n=2), resulting in a **triplet** (n+1=3). The coupling constant for this interaction (J_axial) is typically large. Each peak of this triplet is then further split by the two equivalent equatorial-type protons (n=2), resulting in another **triplet** (n+1=3). The coupling constant for this interaction (J_equatorial) is typically small.\n    5.  **Final Pattern:** The resulting pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\nThis analysis provides a clear and consistent path from the starting material and spectral data to one of the answer choices.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded proton.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Structure of Product 1\n\n1.  **Starting Material and Reagents:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C. This is a strong base at high temperature, suggesting elimination or rearrangement reactions.\n2.  **Spectroscopic Data for Product 1:**\n    *   **IR:** 1720 cm⁻¹. This is a characteristic absorption for a carbonyl group (C=O), likely a ketone in a six-membered ring.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** The spectrum shows signals at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H). The total proton count is 14, which means the formula is C₁₀H₁₄O (starting with C₁₀H₁₄Br₂, two Br are replaced by one O).\n3.  **Structural Interpretation:** The key piece of data is the signal at 4.79 ppm (2H). This chemical shift is typical for vinylic protons on an exocyclic double bond (=CH₂). A simple rearrangement to a saturated ketone like adamantanone or protoadamantanone would not produce any signals in this region. The reaction must therefore produce an unsaturated ketone. A known reaction for 1,3-dihaloadamantanes under these conditions is a Grob fragmentation, which opens the adamantane cage. This pathway leads to **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**.\n4.  **Consistency Check:** This structure is perfectly consistent with all the data:\n    *   It has the formula C₁₀H₁₄O.\n    *   It contains a ketone in a six-membered ring (IR at 1720 cm⁻¹).\n    *   It has an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂), accounting for the two vinylic protons at 4.79 ppm.\n    *   The remaining 12 protons belong to the bicyclic framework.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2\n\n1.  **Reaction:** Product 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide.\n2.  **Transformation:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction selectively reduces the ketone functional group to an alcohol. The carbon-carbon double bond is not affected.\n3.  **Product 2:** The structure is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3\n\n1.  **Reaction:** Product 2 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n2.  **Transformation:** This is a standard ozonolysis with a reductive workup. The reaction cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) is cleaved to form a ketone (=O) at that position (C7) and formaldehyde as a byproduct. The alcohol group at C3 is unaffected.\n3.  **Product 3:** The final product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3\n\n1.  **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton:** In Product 3 (bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one), we need to find the most deshielded proton, excluding the exchangeable alcohol proton (-OH). The proton attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-C3) is directly bonded to a carbon attached to an electronegative oxygen atom. Its chemical shift (typically 3.5-4.5 ppm) is significantly downfield compared to the protons alpha to the ketone (at C6 and C8, ~2.5-3.0 ppm) and all other aliphatic protons. Therefore, **H-C3 is the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton**.\n2.  **Determine the Coupling Pattern of H-C3:**\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C3 and C7. It exists in a stable chair-chair conformation.\n    *   The proton H-C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4. Both C2 and C4 are methylene (-CH₂-) groups.\n    *   H-C3 is coupled to a total of four neighboring protons.\n    *   Due to the molecule's symmetry, the two protons on C2 are equivalent in their coupling effect to the two protons on C4.\n    *   We can analyze the coupling of H-C3 to two sets of equivalent protons:\n        *   **Set 1:** The two axial-type protons (one on C2, one on C4). Let's call their coupling constant J_A.\n        *   **Set 2:** The two equatorial-type protons (one on C2, one on C4). Let's call their coupling constant J_B.\n    *   In the chair conformation, the coupling constant between axial-type protons (J_A) is large (typically 10-13 Hz), while the coupling constant between axial and equatorial-type protons (J_B) is small (typically 2-5 Hz).\n    *   Since J_A and J_B are different, the signal for H-C3 is split first by one pair of protons and then by the other.\n    *   Coupling to the two equivalent protons with the larger coupling constant (J_A) splits the signal into a **triplet** (n=2, so n+1=3).\n    *   Each peak of this triplet is then further split by the two equivalent protons with the smaller coupling constant (J_B), resulting in another **triplet**.\n    *   The final, overall pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the multi-step synthesis problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of Product 1**\n\n1.  **Starting Material & Reagents**: The reaction starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane and uses excess potassium hydroxide (KOH) at a high temperature (240°C).\n2.  **Spectroscopic Data**: Product 1 has an IR absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is characteristic of a ketone (C=O). The ¹H NMR spectrum shows signals at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H).\n3.  **Analysis**:\n    *   The total proton count from the NMR is 14, which means the formula is C₁₀H₁₄O (assuming the adamantane carbon skeleton is largely intact).\n    *   The signal at 4.79 ppm is in the vinylic region, indicating a C=C double bond with two protons, characteristic of an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂).\n    *   A molecule with the formula C₁₀H₁₄O that contains both a ketone and a double bond must have four degrees of unsaturation. The adamantane (tricyclic) skeleton has three degrees of unsaturation. To accommodate a ketone and a double bond (total of five degrees of unsaturation), the cage must have opened to become bicyclic (two degrees of unsaturation). A bicyclic skeleton (2) + a ketone (1) + a double bond (1) = 4 degrees of unsaturation, which matches the formula C₁₀H₁₄O.\n    *   The reaction of 1,3-dihaloadamantanes with a strong base is a known process called a Grob fragmentation, which leads to a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane derivative. The structure that perfectly matches all the data is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. This structure has the correct formula, a ketone in a six-membered ring, and an exocyclic methylene group.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n\n1.  **Reagents**: Product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide.\n2.  **Analysis**: This reagent is used for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which selectively reduces ketones to alcohols. The C=C double bond is not affected by this reagent.\n3.  **Structure**: The ketone group in 7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one is reduced to a hydroxyl group. Product 2 is therefore **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n\n1.  **Reagents**: Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n2.  **Analysis**: This is a reductive ozonolysis, which cleaves the C=C double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) of Product 2 is cleaved to form a ketone (=O) at that position (C7), while the alcohol group at C3 remains untouched.\n3.  **Structure**: The final product, Product 3, is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n1.  **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton**: In Product 3, the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton is the one attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-C3). Its chemical shift is typically higher than that of protons alpha to the ketone or other aliphatic protons.\n2.  **Determine the Coupling Pattern**:\n    *   **Symmetry**: The structure of bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one has a plane of symmetry that passes through C3 and C7.\n    *   **Neighbors**: The carbinol proton (H-C3) is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4. Both C2 and C4 are methylene (-CH₂-) groups.\n    *   **Equivalence**: Due to the plane of symmetry, the two protons on C2 are chemically equivalent to the two protons on C4. However, within each methylene group, the two protons (one axial-like, one equatorial-like) are not equivalent to each other. This means H-C3 is coupled to two sets of two equivalent protons: the two axial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4) and the two equatorial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n    *   **Splitting**: The signal for H-C3 is first split by the two equivalent axial-like protons into a **triplet** (according to the n+1 rule, where n=2). Each peak of this triplet is then further split by the two equivalent equatorial-like protons into another **triplet**. The coupling constants for these two interactions will be different (large for axial-axial, small for axial-equatorial).\n    *   **Final Pattern**: The resulting pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the multi-step reaction to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of Product 1**\n\nThe starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. It is heated with a strong base (KOH) at a high temperature. The provided data for the product (Product 1) is key:\n*   **IR Spectrum:** An absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of a ketone (C=O) functional group.\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:** The spectrum shows signals at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H). The total proton count is 14, the same as the starting material, implying a formula of C₁₀H₁₄O. The signal at 4.79 ppm is highly characteristic of vinylic protons on an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂).\n\nA structure with a C₁₀H₁₄O formula, a ketone, and a double bond cannot have the tricyclic adamantane skeleton (which would require a formula of C₁₀H₁₂O). This indicates that the adamantane cage has undergone a rearrangement and fragmentation to form a bicyclic structure.\n\nThe most plausible reaction is a Grob fragmentation. This leads to the formation of **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. This structure is fully consistent with all the provided data: it is a bicyclic ketone with an exocyclic methylene group and has the correct formula.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n\nProduct 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is heated with aluminum isopropoxide. This reagent performs a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which selectively reduces the ketone to an alcohol while leaving the C=C double bond unaffected. Therefore, Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n\nProduct 2 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethyl sulfide (DMS). This is a reductive ozonolysis reaction, which cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) is cleaved to form a ketone (=O) at that position (C7). The alcohol group at C3 is not affected by this reaction. The final product, Product 3, is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\nThe question asks for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in Product 3 (excluding the exchangeable alcohol proton).\n\n1.  **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton:** In bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one, the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton is the one attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-3). The electronegative oxygen atom deshields this proton significantly, placing its chemical shift around 3.5-4.5 ppm, which is further downfield than the protons alpha to the ketone.\n\n2.  **Determine the Coupling Environment:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C3, the C9 bridge, and C7. The carbinol proton (H-3) is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4. Both C2 and C4 are methylene (CH₂) groups.\n\n3.  **Predict the Splitting Pattern:**\n    *   H-3 is coupled to a total of four neighboring protons (two on C2 and two on C4).\n    *   Due to the molecule's symmetry, these four protons form two distinct sets of two equivalent protons.\n        *   **Set A:** The two axial-type protons (one on C2, one on C4) are equivalent to each other.\n        *   **Set B:** The two equatorial-type protons (one on C2, one on C4) are also equivalent to each other.\n    *   The coupling constant between H-3 and the protons in Set A (J_A) will be different from the coupling constant to the protons in Set B (J_B).\n    *   The coupling of H-3 to the two equivalent protons of Set A splits the signal into a **triplet** (n+1 = 2+1 = 3).\n    *   Each peak of this triplet is then further split by the two equivalent protons of Set B, also into a **triplet**.\n\nThe resulting overall pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the multi-step synthesis problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of Product 1**\n\n1.  **Starting Material and Reagents**: 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C. The adamantane cage is rigid, and standard elimination or substitution reactions are difficult. The harsh conditions (strong base, high temperature) are known to induce skeletal rearrangements.\n2.  **Spectroscopic Data**:\n    *   The IR spectrum shows an absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is characteristic of a ketone (C=O) functional group.\n    *   The ¹H NMR spectrum shows a total of 14 protons (2H + 10H + 2H), which means no protons were lost from the C₁₀H₁₄ core of adamantane. The formula of Product 1 is therefore C₁₀H₁₄O.\n    *   Crucially, there is a signal at 4.79 ppm for 2 protons. This chemical shift is typical for vinylic protons on an exocyclic double bond (=CH₂).\n3.  **Structural Deduction**: A saturated tricyclic ketone (an isomer of adamantanone) would have the formula C₁₀H₁₄O but would not have any vinylic protons. For a molecule to have both a C=C and a C=O group and still have 14 protons, the adamantane cage must have opened to form a bicyclic system. A bicyclic skeleton (2 degrees of unsaturation) with one C=C bond (1 degree) and one C=O bond (1 degree) has a total of 4 degrees of unsaturation, which corresponds to the formula C₁₀H₁₄O.\n4.  **Conclusion for Product 1**: The structure that perfectly fits all the evidence is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. This product results from a known fragmentation/rearrangement of adamantane derivatives. It is a bicyclic ketone with an exocyclic methylene group, accounting for all spectral data.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n\n1.  **Reaction**: Product 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is heated with aluminum isopropoxide.\n2.  **Transformation**: This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction selectively reduces the ketone functional group to an alcohol and does not affect the C=C double bond.\n3.  **Conclusion for Product 2**: The ketone at C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group. Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n\n1.  **Reaction**: Product 2 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n2.  **Transformation**: This is a standard ozonolysis with a reductive workup. The reaction cleaves the C=C double bond. The exocyclic =CH₂ group is cleaved to form a ketone at the C7 position of the ring, with formaldehyde as a byproduct. The alcohol group at C3 is unaffected.\n3.  **Conclusion for Product 3**: The final product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n1.  **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton**: In Product 3 (bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one), we must find the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton. The proton on the carbon bearing the alcohol group (the carbinol proton, H-C3) is directly attached to a carbon bonded to an electronegative oxygen atom. Its chemical shift (typically 3.5-4.5 ppm) is significantly downfield compared to other protons, such as those alpha to the ketone (~2.5 ppm). Therefore, H-C3 is the most deshielded proton.\n2.  **Determine the Coupling Pattern of H-C3**:\n    *   The bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane system exists in a stable chair-chair conformation. The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C3 and C7.\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4.\n    *   Both C2 and C4 are methylene (-CH₂) groups. Due to the molecule's symmetry, the two protons on C2 are equivalent in their coupling relationship to H-C3 as the two protons on C4.\n    *   In total, H-C3 is coupled to four neighboring protons. These four protons can be grouped into two sets of two equivalent protons: the two axial-type protons (one on C2, one on C4) and the two equatorial-type protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n    *   Coupling to the first pair of equivalent protons (e.g., the two axial-type protons) splits the H-C3 signal into a **triplet** (n=2, so n+1=3).\n    *   Each line of this triplet is then further split by the second pair of equivalent protons (the two equatorial-type protons) into another **triplet**.\n    *   The resulting pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded proton.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C.\n*   **Analysis of Product 1 Data:**\n    *   **IR Spectrum:** The absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a ketone (C=O), likely in a six-membered ring.\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum:** The signal at 4.79 ppm (2H) is highly indicative of vinylic protons on an exocyclic double bond (=CH₂). The total proton count (2H + 10H + 2H = 14H) matches the starting material, implying a formula of C₁₀H₁₄O.\n*   **Structural Deduction:** The harsh reaction conditions on the rigid 1,3-dihaloadamantane system are known to induce a skeletal rearrangement called a Grob fragmentation. This specific reaction is documented to produce **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. This structure perfectly accounts for all the provided spectral data: it is a C₁₀H₁₄O bicyclic compound with a ketone in one six-membered ring (IR at 1720 cm⁻¹) and an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) in the other (NMR at 4.79 ppm).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction selectively reduces ketones to alcohols while leaving carbon-carbon double bonds unaffected.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone at C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group, yielding **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by a reductive workup with dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard ozonolysis reaction. The ozonolysis cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) is cleaved to form a ketone (=O) at the C7 position. The alcohol group at C3 is unaffected.\n*   **Product 3:** The final product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n*   **Structure:** Product 3 is bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one. This molecule is highly symmetric, possessing a plane of symmetry that passes through the C3-OH bond, the C9 methylene bridge, and the C7=O bond.\n*   **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton:** The most deshielded non-exchangeable proton is the one attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-C3). This is due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the adjacent oxygen atom. Its chemical shift is typically in the 3.5-4.5 ppm range, which is more deshielded than the protons alpha to the ketone (~2.5-3.0 ppm).\n*   **Determine the Coupling Pattern of H-C3:**\n    1.  The proton at C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, which are C2 and C4.\n    2.  Both C2 and C4 are methylene (CH₂) groups. Therefore, H-C3 is coupled to a total of four neighboring protons.\n    3.  Due to the molecule's plane of symmetry, the two protons on C2 are in an equivalent environment to the two protons on C4.\n    4.  The four neighboring protons can be divided into two sets of two equivalent protons:\n        *   **Set A:** The two axial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n        *   **Set B:** The two equatorial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n    5.  The coupling constant between H-C3 and the two protons in Set A will be similar (J_A), and the coupling constant to the two protons in Set B will also be similar (J_B). Typically, the axial-axial coupling (J_A) is large, while the axial-equatorial coupling (J_B) is small.\n    6.  The signal for H-C3 is first split by the two equivalent protons of Set A into a **triplet** (n=2, so n+1=3).\n    7.  Each peak of this triplet is then further split by the two equivalent protons of Set B into another **triplet**.\n    8.  The resulting overall pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\nComparing this result to the options:\nA) triplet of triplets\nB) triplet\nC) pentet\nD) doublet of triplets\n\nThe correct coupling pattern is a triplet of triplets.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the most logical points from the candidate answers.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of Product 1**\n\nThe first step is to identify Product 1, formed from 1,3-dibromoadamantane with hot KOH. The provided data is crucial:\n*   **IR Spectrum:** An absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ strongly indicates a ketone (C=O) functional group, likely within a six-membered ring.\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:** The spectrum shows a total of 14 protons (2H + 10H + 2H), which means no protons were lost from the starting material's C₁₀H₁₄ core. The most telling signal is at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is characteristic of vinylic protons on an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂).\n\nA structure that contains a C₁₀ skeleton, a ketone, and an exocyclic double bond must be a bicyclic compound, not a tricyclic adamantane derivative. The reaction is a known, though complex, skeletal rearrangement, likely a Grob fragmentation of an intermediate. The structure that perfectly fits all the data is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. This structure has the correct formula (C₁₀H₁₄O), a ketone in a six-membered ring, and an exocyclic double bond. This interpretation, as seen in Answer 15, is the most faithful to the provided experimental data.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n\nProduct 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is heated with aluminum isopropoxide. This is the standard reagent for a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction selectively reduces the ketone to an alcohol without affecting the carbon-carbon double bond. Therefore, Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n\nProduct 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS). This is a reductive ozonolysis, which cleaves the C=C double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) of Product 2 is cleaved to form a ketone (=O) at that position (C7). The alcohol group at C3 is unaffected by this reaction. The final product, Product 3, is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\nThe question asks for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded non-exchangeable hydrogen atom in Product 3.\n\n1.  **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton:** In bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one, the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton is the one on the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-C3). Its chemical shift is typically in the 3.5-4.5 ppm range, which is significantly more deshielded than the protons alpha to the ketone (~2.5-3.0 ppm) or any other aliphatic protons.\n\n2.  **Determine the Coupling Pattern:** To find the splitting pattern of H-C3, we must identify its neighboring protons.\n    *   **Symmetry:** Product 3 is a highly symmetric molecule, possessing a plane of symmetry that passes through C3 and C7.\n    *   **Neighbors:** The proton at C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4. Both C2 and C4 are methylene (CH₂) groups. Therefore, H-C3 is coupled to a total of four neighboring protons.\n    *   **Equivalence:** Due to the molecule's symmetry, the coupling of H-C3 to the two protons on C2 is identical to its coupling to the two protons on C4. However, within each CH₂ group, the two protons (one axial-like, one equatorial-like) are not equivalent to each other.\n    *   Let's denote the coupling constant between H-C3 and the two equivalent axial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4) as J_A.\n    *   Let's denote the coupling constant between H-C3 and the two equivalent equatorial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4) as J_B.\n    *   Typically, in a chair conformation, J_A (axial-axial type) is large, while J_B (axial-equatorial type) is small.\n    *   **Splitting:** The signal for H-C3 is first split by the two equivalent protons with coupling J_A. According to the n+1 rule (where n=2), this gives a **triplet**. Each of the three lines of this triplet is then further split by the other two equivalent protons with coupling J_B. This second splitting also produces a **triplet**.\n\nThe resulting overall pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the most logical points from the candidate answers to arrive at a final conclusion.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of Product 1**\n\nThis is the most critical step, as there is an apparent contradiction in the provided information that must be resolved.\n\n*   **Reaction:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane + excess KOH, 240°C → Product 1.\n*   **Spectroscopic Data for Product 1:**\n    *   IR: 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates a ketone (C=O).\n    *   ¹H NMR: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), 1.94 ppm (2H).\n*   **Analysis of Data:**\n    1.  The total proton count is 2 + 10 + 2 = 14. This means the molecular formula is C₁₀H₁₄O.\n    2.  The signal at 4.79 ppm is highly characteristic of vinylic protons, specifically an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂).\n    3.  The subsequent reaction is ozonolysis, which requires a C=C double bond. This confirms the presence of an alkene.\n*   **Reconciling the Data:** A molecule with the formula C₁₀H₁₄O that contains both a ketone and a double bond cannot be a tricyclic adamantane derivative (which would require a formula of C₁₀H₁₂O). The reaction must involve a skeletal rearrangement that opens the adamantane cage. The reaction of 1,3-dihaloadamantanes with a strong base is known to cause a Grob fragmentation.\n*   **Conclusion for Product 1:** The structure that perfectly fits all the provided data is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. This structure has the correct formula (C₁₀H₁₄O), a ketone in a six-membered ring (consistent with the IR), and an exocyclic methylene group (consistent with the NMR). This approach, as taken by Answer 15, is superior to those that dismiss the provided NMR data as erroneous.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction is highly selective for reducing aldehydes and ketones to alcohols and will not affect the carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Conclusion for Product 2:** The ketone at position C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group. Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard ozonolysis with a reductive workup. The reaction cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) is cleaved to form a ketone (=O) at position C7. The alcohol group at C3 remains unchanged.\n*   **Conclusion for Product 3:** The final product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n*   **Question:** What is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding those that will exchange with deuterated solvent)?\n*   **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton:** In Product 3 (bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one), the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton is the one attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-C3). The electronegative oxygen atom deshields this proton, placing its signal significantly downfield from the other protons on the carbon skeleton.\n*   **Determine the Coupling Pattern:**\n    1.  The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C3 and C7.\n    2.  The proton at C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4.\n    3.  Both C2 and C4 are methylene groups (-CH₂-), so H-C3 is coupled to a total of four neighboring protons.\n    4.  Due to the molecule's symmetry and its stable chair-chair conformation, the four neighboring protons can be grouped into two distinct pairs of equivalent protons:\n        *   Two equivalent axial-type protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n        *   Two equivalent equatorial-type protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n    5.  The coupling of H-C3 to the two equivalent axial-type protons (with coupling constant J_ax) splits the signal into a **triplet** (n+1 = 2+1 = 3).\n    6.  Each peak of this triplet is then further split by the two equivalent equatorial-type protons (with a different coupling constant J_eq), resulting in another **triplet**.\n    7.  Therefore, the overall coupling pattern for the most deshielded proton (H-C3) is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of Product 1**\n\nThe first step is to identify Product 1, formed from the reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. This is the most critical step, as it dictates the rest of the synthesis.\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C₁₀H₁₄Br₂).\n*   **Provided Data for Product 1:**\n    *   IR spectrum: 1720 cm⁻¹. This is a strong indicator of a ketone (C=O) functional group.\n    *   ¹H NMR spectrum: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), 1.94 ppm (2H). The total integration is 14 protons, meaning the formula is C₁₀H₁₄O. The signal at 4.79 ppm is highly characteristic of vinylic protons on an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂).\n*   **Structural Deduction:** A molecule with the formula C₁₀H₁₄O has four degrees of unsaturation. The adamantane skeleton is tricyclic (3 degrees). A ketone adds one more degree, for a total of four. This would describe a saturated ketone like adamantanone. However, the NMR data clearly shows a C=C double bond, which would add a fifth degree of unsaturation. This is a contradiction.\n*   **Resolving the Contradiction:** As pointed out in several answers (e.g., Answer 8, Answer 15), the only way for a C₁₀H₁₄O molecule to contain both a ketone (1 DoU) and a double bond (1 DoU) is if the carbon skeleton is bicyclic (2 DoU), for a total of 2+1+1 = 4 degrees of unsaturation. This means the adamantane cage must have opened during the reaction.\n*   **Most Plausible Structure:** The reaction of 1,3-dihaloadamantanes under these conditions can proceed via a Grob fragmentation. This mechanism leads to **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. This structure, as identified in **Answer 15**, perfectly matches all the provided data for Product 1. Many other answers ignore this crucial NMR data and propose other structures like protoadamantanone or adamantanone, which is a less rigorous approach.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n\nProduct 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is heated with aluminum isopropoxide.\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction selectively reduces ketones to alcohols and does not affect C=C double bonds.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone at C3 is reduced to an alcohol. Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**. This is consistent with the analysis in **Answer 15**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n\nProduct 2 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is a reductive ozonolysis, which cleaves the C=C double bond.\n*   **Transformation:** The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) at C7 is cleaved to form a ketone (=O) at that position. The alcohol group at C3 is unaffected.\n*   **Product 3:** The final product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**. This is consistent with the analysis in **Answer 15**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\nThe final task is to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton in Product 3 (bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one).\n\n1.  **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton:** In this keto-alcohol, the proton on the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-C3) is the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton. It is directly attached to a carbon bonded to an electronegative oxygen atom.\n2.  **Analyze the Coupling (Splitting):**\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry (Cₛ) passing through C3 and C7.\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4.\n    *   C2 and C4 are both methylene (-CH₂-) groups. Due to the symmetry, the protons on C2 are equivalent to the protons on C4.\n    *   Therefore, H-C3 is coupled to a total of four neighboring protons. These four protons exist as two distinct pairs of equivalent protons:\n        *   Pair 1: The two axial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n        *   Pair 2: The two equatorial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n    *   The coupling constant to the first pair (J_A) will be different from the coupling constant to the second pair (J_B).\n    *   According to the n+1 rule, coupling to the first pair of equivalent protons (n=2) splits the signal into a **triplet**.\n    *   Each line of this triplet is then further split by the second pair of equivalent protons (n=2) into another **triplet**.\n3.  **Conclusion:** The resulting pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\nThis conclusion is reached in the reasoning of multiple answers (2, 3, 4, 6, 11, 15), although some arrive there via a different, less likely chemical pathway. The pathway and analysis detailed in Answer 15 are the most consistent with all the information provided in the problem.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the multi-step synthesis problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of Product 1**\n\nThe first step is to identify the structure of Product 1, formed from 1,3-dibromoadamantane with hot KOH. The provided data is crucial:\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C₁₀H₁₄Br₂).\n*   **Product 1 Data:**\n    *   **IR Spectrum:** 1720 cm⁻¹. This is a strong indicator of a ketone (C=O) functional group, likely within a six-membered ring.\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum:** The total integration is 14 protons (2H + 10H + 2H), which means no carbons or hydrogens have been lost. The formula must be C₁₀H₁₄O.\n    *   **¹H NMR Chemical Shift:** A signal at 4.79 ppm (2H) is highly characteristic of vinylic protons on an exocyclic double bond (=CH₂).\n\nThere is an apparent contradiction: a saturated tricyclic ketone (like an adamantanone isomer) would have the formula C₁₀H₁₄O, but it would not have a C=C double bond. An unsaturated ketone would have a C=C bond, but its formula would be C₁₀H₁₂O. The only way to satisfy all conditions (formula C₁₀H₁₄O, a ketone, and a double bond) is if the tricyclic adamantane cage has opened to form a bicyclic structure.\n\nThe structure that perfectly fits all the data is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**.\n*   It is a bicyclic molecule.\n*   Its formula is C₁₀H₁₄O.\n*   It contains a ketone in a six-membered ring (consistent with the IR peak).\n*   It has an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂), which accounts for the ¹H NMR signal at 4.79 ppm (2H).\nThis structure is a known product of the Grob fragmentation of a 1-bromo-3-hydroxyadamantane intermediate, which is a plausible reaction pathway under the given conditions. This analysis, as detailed in candidate answer 15, is the most consistent with the provided experimental data.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n\nProduct 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is heated with aluminum isopropoxide. This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which selectively reduces the ketone to an alcohol. The C=C double bond is unaffected.\n*   **Product 2 is 7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol.**\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n\nProduct 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS). This is a reductive ozonolysis, which cleaves the C=C double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) is cleaved to form a ketone (=O) at that position (C7), while the alcohol group at C3 remains unchanged.\n*   **Product 3 is bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one.**\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\nThe final task is to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton in Product 3 (bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one).\n\n1.  **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton:** In this molecule, the proton attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-C3) is the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton. Its chemical shift is typically in the 3.5-4.5 ppm range, which is further downfield than the protons alpha to the ketone or any other aliphatic protons.\n\n2.  **Determine the Coupling Pattern:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry passing through C3, C9, and C7. This makes the two six-membered rings equivalent.\n    *   **Neighboring Protons:** The proton at C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4. Each of these is a methylene (-CH₂-) group, so H-C3 is coupled to a total of four neighboring protons.\n    *   **Equivalence:** Due to the molecule's symmetry, the two protons on C2 are equivalent by reflection to the two protons on C4. However, within each CH₂ group, the axial and equatorial protons are different. Therefore, H-C3 is coupled to two equivalent axial-type protons (one on C2, one on C4) and two equivalent equatorial-type protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n    *   **Splitting:** A proton coupled to two sets of two equivalent protons will exhibit a \"triplet of triplets\" pattern. The signal is first split into a triplet by one pair of equivalent protons, and each line of that triplet is further split into another triplet by the second pair of equivalent protons.\n\nTherefore, the coupling pattern for the most deshielded hydrogen atom in Product 3 is a triplet of triplets.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the multi-step synthesis problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of Product 1**\n\n1.  **Reaction:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C. The adamantane cage is very rigid, and reactions at the bridgehead positions are unusual. Standard elimination (E2) is forbidden by Bredt's rule, and substitution (S_N1/S_N2) is extremely slow. The harsh conditions (strong base, high temperature) strongly suggest a skeletal rearrangement.\n2.  **Spectroscopic Data:**\n    *   **IR Spectrum:** A peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a definitive indicator of a ketone (C=O) functional group, likely within a six-membered ring.\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum:** The spectrum shows signals at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H).\n3.  **Analysis and Reconciliation:**\n    *   The total proton count is 14, matching the starting material (C₁₀H₁₄Br₂). The reaction likely involves the replacement of 2 Br atoms with one oxygen, giving a formula of C₁₀H₁₄O.\n    *   The signal at 4.79 ppm is in the characteristic region for vinylic protons, and the integration of 2H strongly suggests an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂).\n    *   A molecule with the formula C₁₀H₁₄O has four degrees of unsaturation. If it contains one ketone (C=O, 1 DoU) and one double bond (C=C, 1 DoU), the carbon skeleton must account for the remaining two degrees of unsaturation, which implies a **bicyclic** structure.\n    *   The reaction, therefore, involves a fragmentation of the tricyclic adamantane cage into a bicyclic system. A known reaction under these conditions is a Grob fragmentation, which leads to **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. This structure perfectly matches all the provided data: it is a bicyclic ketone with an exocyclic methylene group.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n\n1.  **Reaction:** Product 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is heated with aluminum isopropoxide.\n2.  **Analysis:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction is highly selective for reducing aldehydes and ketones to their corresponding alcohols and does not affect carbon-carbon double bonds.\n3.  **Product 2:** The ketone group at C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group. Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n\n1.  **Reaction:** Product 2 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by a reductive workup with dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n2.  **Analysis:** This is a standard ozonolysis reaction. The ozone cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) is converted into a ketone (=O) at C7, with formaldehyde as a byproduct. The alcohol group at C3 is unaffected.\n3.  **Product 3:** The final product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n1.  **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton:** In Product 3 (bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one), we must find the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton. The proton attached to the carbon bearing the alcohol group (the carbinol proton, H-C3) is directly bonded to a carbon attached to an electronegative oxygen atom. Its chemical shift (~3.5-4.5 ppm) is typically significantly downfield compared to protons alpha to the ketone (~2.5-3.0 ppm) or other aliphatic protons. Therefore, **H-C3 is the most deshielded proton**.\n2.  **Determine the Coupling Pattern of H-C3:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C3 and C7.\n    *   **Neighbors:** The proton at C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4. Both C2 and C4 are methylene (-CH₂-) groups.\n    *   **Conformation:** The bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane system exists in a stable chair-chair conformation.\n    *   **Coupling Analysis:** H-C3 is coupled to a total of four neighboring protons. Due to the molecule's symmetry, these four protons form two distinct pairs of chemically equivalent protons:\n        *   **Pair 1:** The two axial-type protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n        *   **Pair 2:** The two equatorial-type protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n    *   The coupling constant between H-C3 and the two axial-type protons (J_ax) will be different from the coupling constant to the two equatorial-type protons (J_eq). Typically, J_ax is large (~10-13 Hz) and J_eq is small (~2-5 Hz).\n    *   **Resulting Pattern:** The signal for H-C3 is first split by the two equivalent axial-type protons into a **triplet** (n=2, so n+1=3). Each peak of this triplet is then further split by the two equivalent equatorial-type protons into another **triplet**. The final, observable pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded proton.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of Product 1**\n\n1.  **Starting Material and Reagents**: 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C. The adamantane cage is tricyclic, and the bromines are at bridgehead positions.\n2.  **Spectroscopic Data for Product 1**:\n    *   IR spectrum: An absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a ketone (C=O) functional group, typically in a six-membered ring.\n    *   ¹H NMR spectrum: The total integration is 14 protons (2H + 10H + 2H), which means no carbons or hydrogens have been lost. The formula is C₁₀H₁₄O. The signal at 4.79 ppm (2H) is highly indicative of vinylic protons on an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂).\n3.  **Structural Deduction**:\n    *   The degree of unsaturation for C₁₀H₁₄O is (2*10 + 2 - 14)/2 = 4.\n    *   A ketone (C=O) accounts for one degree of unsaturation. A double bond (C=C) accounts for another. This leaves two degrees of unsaturation to be accounted for by rings. Therefore, the product must be bicyclic.\n    *   The harsh reaction conditions (strong base, high temperature) on 1,3-dihaloadamantanes are known to cause a skeletal rearrangement, often via a Grob fragmentation, to form a bicyclic system.\n    *   The structure that perfectly fits all the data is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**. This molecule is bicyclic, contains a ketone in a six-membered ring, and has an exocyclic methylene group.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n\n1.  **Reaction**: Product 1 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide.\n2.  **Analysis**: This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction selectively reduces ketones and aldehydes to their corresponding alcohols. It does not affect carbon-carbon double bonds.\n3.  **Structure of Product 2**: The ketone group at C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group. Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n\n1.  **Reaction**: Product 2 (7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n2.  **Analysis**: This is a reductive ozonolysis. This reaction cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) is cleaved to form a ketone at that position (C7) and formaldehyde (which is removed during workup). The alcohol group at C3 is unaffected.\n3.  **Structure of Product 3**: The final product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n1.  **Identify the Most Deshielded Proton**: In Product 3 (bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one), we need to find the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton. The proton on the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, H-C3) is directly attached to a carbon bonded to an electronegative oxygen atom. This makes it the most deshielded C-H proton, with a typical chemical shift of 3.5-4.5 ppm. Protons alpha to the ketone (at C6 and C8) are less deshielded.\n2.  **Determine the Coupling Pattern**:\n    *   The structure of Product 3 has a plane of symmetry passing through C3 and C7. The molecule exists in a stable chair-chair conformation.\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4.\n    *   Both C2 and C4 are methylene (-CH₂-) groups. Therefore, H-C3 is coupled to a total of four neighboring protons.\n    *   Due to the molecule's symmetry, the coupling of H-C3 to the two protons on C2 is identical to its coupling to the two protons on C4.\n    *   Let's consider the protons on one side, for example, C2. It has an axial proton (H2ax) and an equatorial proton (H2eq). H-C3 will have a large coupling constant (J_ax) to the two equivalent axial-type protons (H2ax and H4ax) and a small coupling constant (J_eq) to the two equivalent equatorial-type protons (H2eq and H4eq).\n    *   The signal for H-C3 is first split by the two equivalent axial-type protons. According to the n+1 rule (where n=2), this results in a **triplet**.\n    *   Each peak of this triplet is then further split by the two equivalent equatorial-type protons. This also results in a **triplet**.\n    *   The final, overall pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
