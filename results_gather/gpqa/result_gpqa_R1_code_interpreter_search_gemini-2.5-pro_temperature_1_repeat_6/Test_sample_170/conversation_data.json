    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Reaction and Substituent Effects**\n\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a benzene ring. The substituent already on the ring directs the incoming electrophile (Br+) to certain positions. This directing effect determines the product distribution (ortho, meta, para isomers).\n\n*   **Activating groups**: These donate electron density to the ring, speed up the reaction, and are *ortho, para*-directing. Examples: -CH3, -C2H5.\n*   **Deactivating groups**: These withdraw electron density from the ring, slow down the reaction.\n    *   Most are *meta*-directing. Examples: -NO2, -COOH, -COOC2H5.\n    *   Halogens (-Cl) are an exception: they are deactivating but *ortho, para*-directing.\n\nThe question asks to order the substances by the increasing yield of the *para*-isomer.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents and Group the Substances**\n\nFirst, we separate the substances into two groups: those that will produce very little para-isomer (meta-directors) and those that will produce a significant amount (ortho, para-directors).\n\n*   **Meta-directors**: These will have the lowest para-isomer yields.\n    *   4) C6H5-NO2 (Nitro group)\n    *   6) C6H5-COOH (Carboxylic acid group)\n    *   2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ester group)\n*   **Ortho, para-directors**: These will have the highest para-isomer yields.\n    *   1) C6H5-CH3 (Methyl group)\n    *   5) C6H5-C2H5 (Ethyl group)\n    *   3) C6H5-Cl (Chloro group)\n\nThis means the correct order will look like: {Group of 4, 6, 2} < {Group of 1, 5, 3}.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Meta-Directors (Substances 4, 6, 2)**\n\nFor meta-directors, the para-isomer is a minor byproduct. The yield of this byproduct will be smaller for substituents that are more strongly deactivating and meta-directing. We need to order them by their deactivating strength.\n\n*   The nitro group (-NO2) is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is a strong deactivating group.\n*   The ester group (-COOC2H5) is also a strong deactivating group, but slightly weaker than -COOH because the ethyl group (+C2H5) is weakly electron-donating, which slightly lessens the withdrawal effect compared to the H in -COOH.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength is: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5.\n\nA stronger deactivating/meta-directing group leads to a more selective reaction for the meta position, and thus a *lower* yield of the para-isomer. Therefore, the order of increasing para-yield is:\n**4 (-NO2) < 6 (-COOH) < 2 (-COOC2H5)**\n\n**Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directors (Substances 1, 5, 3)**\n\nFor these substances, both ortho and para isomers are major products. The ratio of para to ortho (p/o ratio) determines the yield of the para-isomer. A higher p/o ratio means a higher para-yield. This ratio is influenced by two main factors: steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n1.  **Comparing -CH3 (1) and -C2H5 (5)**: Both are activating alkyl groups. The primary difference is their size. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is significantly larger than the methyl group (-CH3). The greater steric hindrance from the ethyl group makes it harder for the bromine to attack the adjacent ortho positions. This leads to a much higher proportion of the para-isomer for ethylbenzene than for toluene.\n    *   Therefore, the order of para-yield is: **1 (-CH3) < 5 (-C2H5)**.\n\n2.  **Comparing with -Cl (3)**: The chloro group is deactivating but o,p-directing. Its directing effect is complex.\n    *   **Steric Effect**: The Cl atom is smaller than an ethyl group but comparable to a methyl group. Based on sterics alone, its position in the ranking is not immediately obvious relative to the alkyl groups.\n    *   **Electronic Effect**: Halogens have a strong, distance-dependent inductive withdrawal effect (-I). This effect deactivates the ortho positions (which are closer) more strongly than the para position. This electronic factor strongly favors para substitution, leading to a high p/o ratio for chlorobenzene.\n\n3.  **Combining the o,p-directors**: We have established that 1 < 5. Now we must place 3. The question requires choosing from the given options. Let's analyze the logic that leads to option C. The sequence for o,p-directors in option C is **1 < 5 < 3**. This implies that the para-yield for chlorobenzene (3) is the highest of the three. This line of reasoning assumes that the electronic preference for the para position in chlorobenzene (due to the -I effect) outweighs the steric effect that gives ethylbenzene (5) a high para-yield. While experimental data often shows ethylbenzene having a slightly higher para yield than chlorobenzene, this \"electronics over sterics\" argument is a plausible piece of qualitative reasoning used in some chemistry contexts.\n\n**Step 5: Combine All Groups into the Final Order**\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors (following the logic for option C): **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nCombining these two ordered sets, we get the final sequence:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis sequence matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
