These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions.

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning for each reaction:\n\n### Reaction A:\n*   **Michael Donor:** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(CO₂Me)₂. In the presence of a strong base like sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), the acidic α-proton between the two carbonyl groups is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate anion, ⁻CH(CO₂Me)₂.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester with the structure p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-CO₂Me.\n*   **Reaction:** The nucleophilic enolate anion attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate. This is a conjugate (or 1,4-) addition.\n    1.  **Attack:** The ⁻CH(CO₂Me)₂ carbanion attacks the β-carbon. The π electrons of the C=C bond shift to the α-carbon, and the π electrons of the C=O bond shift to the oxygen, forming a new enolate intermediate.\n        `p-Tolyl-CH(β)(CH(CO₂Me)₂) - CH(α)=C(O⁻)OMe`\n    2.  **Protonation:** This enolate is then protonated by the solvent (EtOH) at the α-carbon to yield the final, stable product.\n        `p-Tolyl-CH(β)(CH(CO₂Me)₂) - CH₂(α)-CO₂Me`\n*   **Product A Naming:** Let's determine the IUPAC name for the product: `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(CO₂Me)₂) - CH₂-CO₂Me`.\n    We can identify a three-carbon chain as the main backbone, with carboxylate groups attached.\n    ` (MeO₂C)CH₂ - CH(p-Tolyl) - CH(CO₂Me)₂ `\n    Let's number this propane chain: `(MeO₂C)C³H₂ - C²H(p-Tolyl) - C¹H(CO₂Me)₂`\n    - The main chain is propane.\n    - There are three methyl carboxylate groups, making it a `trimethyl ... tricarboxylate`.\n    - The carboxylate groups are at positions 1, 1, and 3. So it is a `propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate`.\n    - There is a p-tolyl substituent at position 2.\n    - The full name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Michael Donor:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, a nitrogen analog of an enol. Enamines are excellent nucleophiles at the α-carbon (C2 of the cyclohexene ring). This type of Michael addition is known as the Stork enamine alkylation.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN.\n*   **Reaction:**\n    1.  **Attack:** The nucleophilic C2 of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. This forms a new C-C bond and an iminium ion intermediate.\n    2.  **Hydrolysis:** The acidic workup (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group (a ketone) at C1 of the cyclohexane ring. The piperidine is removed.\n*   **Product B:** The resulting product is a cyclohexanone ring with a substituent at the C2 position. The substituent is derived from the butenenitrile: `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂CN`.\n    The structure is `2-(-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN)cyclohexan-1-one`.\n*   **Product B Naming:** According to IUPAC rules, the nitrile group (CN) has higher priority than the ketone. Therefore, the main chain is butanenitrile.\n    `CN¹-C²H₂-C³H(substituent)-C⁴H₃`\n    The substituent at C3 is the `(2-oxocyclohexyl)` group.\n    The full name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto form is thermodynamically more stable than the enol form, so it is the major final product.\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   This is a \"retrosynthesis\" problem where we need to identify the starting material C.\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one, also known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK), CH₂(β)=CH(α)-CO-CH₃.\n*   **Analysis:** In a Michael addition, the donor adds to the β-carbon of the acceptor. After the addition and protonation, the MVK molecule becomes the `-CH₂(β)-CH₂(α)-CO-CH₃` group, which is the `3-oxobutyl` group.\n*   The product shows that this `3-oxobutyl` group is attached to the C2 position of a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring. The C-C bond was formed between C2 of the ring and the β-carbon of MVK.\n*   Therefore, the Michael donor (reactant C) must have been **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**. The base (KOH) deprotonates the highly acidic C2 position (located between two carbonyls) to generate the nucleophilic enolate that initiates the attack on MVK.\n\n### Conclusion:\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis set of reactants and products matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
