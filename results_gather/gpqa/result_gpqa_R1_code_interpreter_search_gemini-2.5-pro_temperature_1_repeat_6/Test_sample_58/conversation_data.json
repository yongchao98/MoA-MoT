    "To determine the pH of the final solution, we need to follow these steps:\n1.  Calculate the initial moles of acid (H+) and base (OH-) from each component.\n2.  Account for the neutralization reactions between the strong acid, strong base, and weak acid.\n3.  Determine the composition of the final solution (i.e., what species are present in significant amounts).\n4.  Calculate the pH based on the final composition.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate initial moles**\n\n*   **Moles of CH3COOH (weak acid):**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles = 0.1 mol/L * 0.500 L = **0.050 mol CH3COOH**\n\n*   **Moles of HCl (strong acid):**\n    *   HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely: HCl -> H+ + Cl-\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles of HCl = 0.2 mol/L * 0.400 L = 0.080 mol\n    *   This gives **0.080 mol of H+** ions.\n\n*   **Moles of Ba(OH)2 (strong base):**\n    *   Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it dissociates completely: Ba(OH)2 -> Ba2+ + 2OH-\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 mol/L * 0.300 L = 0.090 mol\n    *   Since each mole of Ba(OH)2 produces two moles of OH-, the moles of OH- are:\n    *   Moles of OH- = 2 * 0.090 mol = **0.180 mol OH-**\n\n**Step 2: Neutralization Reactions**\n\nFirst, the strong acid (H+ from HCl) will react with the strong base (OH- from Ba(OH)2).\n\n*   Initial moles of H+ (strong) = 0.080 mol\n*   Initial moles of OH- (strong) = 0.180 mol\n\nThe neutralization reaction is: H+ + OH- -> H2O\n\nSince there are more moles of OH- than H+, all the H+ from HCl will be consumed.\n\n*   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = **0.100 mol OH-**\n\nNext, the remaining strong base (OH-) will react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n\n*   Initial moles of CH3COOH = 0.050 mol\n*   Moles of OH- available to react = 0.100 mol\n\nThe reaction is: CH3COOH + OH- -> CH3COO- + H2O\n\nSince there are more moles of OH- than CH3COOH, all the weak acid will be consumed.\n\n*   Moles of OH- consumed = 0.050 mol\n*   Moles of OH- remaining (excess) = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = **0.050 mol OH-**\n*   Moles of CH3COOH remaining = 0.050 mol - 0.050 mol = 0 mol\n*   Moles of CH3COO- (conjugate base) formed = 0.050 mol\n\n**Step 3: Determine the final solution composition**\n\nThe final solution contains a significant amount of excess strong base (OH-). The presence of the weak conjugate base (CH3COO-) will have a negligible effect on the overall pH compared to the strong base. Therefore, the pH is determined by the concentration of the excess OH- ions.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final pH**\n\nFirst, calculate the total volume of the solution.\n\n*   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.200 L**\n\nNext, calculate the concentration of the excess OH- ions.\n\n*   [OH-] = Moles of excess OH- / Total Volume\n*   [OH-] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L = 0.04167 M\n\nNow, calculate the pOH.\n\n*   pOH = -log10([OH-])\n*   pOH = -log10(0.04167)\n*   pOH ≈ 1.38\n\nFinally, calculate the pH using the relationship pH + pOH = 14 (at 25°C).\n\n*   pH = 14 - pOH\n*   pH = 14 - 1.38\n*   pH = 12.62\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Moles of reactants\nmoles_ch3cooh = 0.1 * 0.500\nmoles_h_plus_strong = 0.2 * 0.400\nmoles_oh_minus_strong = 2 * (0.3 * 0.300)\n\n# Neutralization of strong acid and strong base\nmoles_oh_minus_after_strong_acid = moles_oh_minus_strong - moles_h_plus_strong\n\n# Neutralization of remaining strong base with weak acid\nmoles_oh_minus_excess = moles_oh_minus_after_strong_acid - moles_ch3cooh\n\n# Total volume\ntotal_volume_L = 0.500 + 0.400 + 0.300\n\n# Final OH- concentration\nfinal_oh_concentration = moles_oh_minus_excess / total_volume_L\n\n# Calculate pOH and pH\npOH = -math.log10(final_oh_concentration)\npH = 14 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"The calculated pH of the solution is: {pH:.2f}\")\n```\n<<<A>>>",
