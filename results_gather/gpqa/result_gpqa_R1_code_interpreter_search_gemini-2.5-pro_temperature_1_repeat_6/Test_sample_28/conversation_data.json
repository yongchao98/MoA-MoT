    "An effective way to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound produced by a gene is to introduce a mutation that results in a non-functional or severely truncated protein. We need to analyze the effect of each mutation on the protein's amino acid sequence.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Goal\nThe objective is to find the mutation that will most likely render the protein non-functional, thereby eliminating the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound. The most severe types of mutations that typically lead to a loss of function are:\n*   **Nonsense mutations:** These introduce a premature stop codon, leading to a truncated protein.\n*   **Frameshift mutations:** These are insertions or deletions of a number of nucleotides not divisible by three, which alters the entire downstream reading frame, usually resulting in a completely different and non-functional protein, often with a premature stop codon.\n\n### 2. Analyzing the Intact Gene\nFirst, let's establish the original coding sequence by grouping the nucleotides into codons (groups of three) starting from the ATG start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene Sequence:** 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...-3’\n*   **Translation (Amino Acid Sequence):** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr - Ser - Val - Asp...\n\nThis is the sequence of the functional protein that produces the unwanted compound.\n\n### 3. Analyzing the Mutants\n\nWe will now compare each mutant to the intact gene.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   Sequence: 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...-3’\n    *   Changes:\n        *   The 2nd codon `TTT` becomes `TTC`. Both `TTT` and `TTC` code for Phenylalanine (Phe). This is a **silent mutation**.\n        *   The 3rd codon `CTC` becomes `TAC`. `CTC` codes for Leucine (Leu), while `TAC` codes for Tyrosine (Tyr). This is a **missense mutation**, changing one amino acid.\n    *   Impact: This mutation results in a full-length protein with only one amino acid change (Leu → Tyr). While this could potentially affect the protein's function, it is not guaranteed to eliminate it.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   Sequence: 5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...-3’\n    *   Changes:\n        *   The 2nd codon `TTT` becomes `TTC` (Silent mutation, Phe → Phe).\n        *   The 3rd codon `CTC` (Leucine) becomes `TAA`. **`TAA` is a stop codon**.\n    *   Impact: This is a **nonsense mutation**. It introduces a premature stop codon very early in the sequence. Translation will stop after the second amino acid, producing a tiny, non-functional peptide (Met-Phe). This is highly probable to eliminate the compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   Sequence: 5’-ATG TTT T ACG CTG GTG TCA CTT CTG TGG...-3’\n    *   Change: An extra `T` has been inserted after the second codon (`TTT`).\n        *   Original Frame: ATG TTT CTC GCT...\n        *   New Frame:     ATG TTT T AC G CTG...\n    *   Impact: This insertion causes a **frameshift mutation**. The reading frame is shifted, and all subsequent codons are read incorrectly (`ACG`, `CTG`, `GTG`, etc.), leading to a completely different amino acid sequence from that point on. This will almost certainly result in a non-functional protein and is a very strong candidate for eliminating the compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   Sequence: 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...-3’\n    *   Change: Comparing to the intact gene (`ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), we see the `CTC` codon has changed to `TAC` (a missense mutation, Leu → Tyr), and the `GGT` codon (Glycine) has been deleted.\n    *   Impact: This is an **in-frame deletion** of one codon, plus a missense mutation. The resulting protein will be one amino acid shorter and have another amino acid changed. Like the missense mutation in Mutant 1, this might alter or eliminate function, but it is less certain than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nBoth Mutant 2 (nonsense) and Mutant 3 (frameshift) are very likely to create a \"knockout\" allele, meaning the gene will no longer produce a functional protein. However, the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a definitive stop signal at the very beginning of the protein-coding sequence. This is the most direct and certain method among the choices to ensure a severely truncated and non-functional protein is produced. Therefore, it is the mutation most likely to achieve the desired outcome.\n\n```python\ndef translate(seq):\n    \"\"\"Translates a DNA sequence into a protein sequence.\"\"\"\n    table = {\n        'ATA':'I', 'ATC':'I', 'ATT':'I', 'ATG':'M', 'ACA':'T', 'ACC':'T', 'ACG':'T', 'ACT':'T',\n        'AAC':'N', 'AAT':'N', 'AAA':'K', 'AAG':'K', 'AGC':'S', 'AGT':'S', 'AGA':'R', 'AGG':'R',\n        'CTA':'L', 'CTC':'L', 'CTG':'L', 'CTT':'L', 'CCA':'P', 'CCC':'P', 'CCG':'P', 'CCT':'P',\n        'CAC':'H', 'CAT':'H', 'CAA':'Q', 'CAG':'Q', 'CGA':'R', 'CGC':'R', 'CGG':'R', 'CGT':'R',\n        'GTA':'V', 'GTC':'V', 'GTG':'V', 'GTT':'V', 'GCA':'A', 'GCC':'A', 'GCG':'A', 'GCT':'A',\n        'GAC':'D', 'GAT':'D', 'GAA':'E', 'GAG':'E', 'GGA':'G', 'GGC':'G', 'GGG':'G', 'GGT':'G',\n        'TCA':'S', 'TCC':'S', 'TCG':'S', 'TCT':'S', 'TTC':'F', 'TTT':'F', 'TTA':'L', 'TTG':'L',\n        'TAC':'Y', 'TAT':'Y', 'TAA':'_', 'TAG':'_', 'TGC':'C', 'TGT':'C', 'TGA':'_', 'TGG':'W',\n    }\n    protein = \"\"\n    # Ensure the sequence starts with ATG\n    if not seq.startswith('ATG'):\n        return \"No start codon\"\n    \n    # Process the sequence in codons\n    for i in range(0, len(seq), 3):\n        if i + 3 <= len(seq):\n            codon = seq[i:i+3]\n            amino_acid = table.get(codon, 'X') # 'X' for unknown codon\n            if amino_acid == '_': # Stop codon\n                protein += '_'\n                break\n            protein += amino_acid\n    return protein\n\n# --- Gene Sequences ---\nintact_gene = \"ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\"\nmutant1 = \"ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\" # Note: sequence is shorter\nmutant2 = \"ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\" # Note: sequence is shorter\nmutant3 = \"ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\"\nmutant4 = \"ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\" # Note: sequence is shorter\n\n# --- Analysis ---\nprint(f\"Intact Protein:  {translate(intact_gene)}\")\nprint(\"---\")\nprint(f\"Mutant 1 Protein:  {translate(mutant1)}\")\nprint(\"Analysis: Missense mutation (Leucine at position 3 -> Tyrosine).

    "The goal is to find the mutation that is most likely to result in a non-functional protein, thereby eliminating the production of the anti-nutritional compound. The most effective mutations for this purpose are those that cause major disruptions to the protein structure, such as nonsense or frameshift mutations.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Intact Gene:**\n    The original coding sequence starts with `ATG` (the start codon). We can read the sequence in triplets (codons) to determine the amino acid sequence.\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT... -3’\n    *   **Amino Acids:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr...\n    This sequence produces the functional protein that synthesizes the unwanted compound.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mutant 1:**\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT... -3’\n    *   **Comparison:**\n        *   The second codon changes from `TTT` to `TTC`. Both codons code for Phenylalanine (Phe), so this is a **silent mutation**.\n        *   The third codon changes from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, which changes a single amino acid.\n    *   **Impact:** The resulting protein is full-length but has one amino acid switched. While this might affect function, it is not guaranteed to eliminate it. The protein could still be partially or fully functional.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mutant 2:**\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT... -3’\n    *   **Comparison:**\n        *   The second codon changes from `TTT` to `TTC` (silent mutation).\n        *   The third codon changes from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAA`. **TAA is a stop codon**.\n    *   **Impact:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. It introduces a premature stop signal. Protein synthesis will halt after the second amino acid. The result is a severely truncated, two-amino-acid-long peptide (Met-Phe), which will be completely non-functional. This is the most certain way to eliminate the target compound.\n\n4.  **Analyze Mutant 3:**\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC... -3’\n    *   **Comparison:** A comparison with the intact sequence shows multiple base changes. For example, `CTC` becomes `TAC` (missense), and further downstream, `ACT` becomes `GTC` (missense). The prompt shows this sequence having an extra `T` compared to the intact gene, suggesting a **frameshift mutation**. A frameshift alters the entire reading frame from the point of insertion, leading to a completely different and almost certainly non-functional amino acid sequence. This is also a very strong candidate for knocking out gene function.\n\n5.  **Analyze Mutant 4:**\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT... -3’\n    *   **Comparison:** This sequence has changed the third codon from `CTC` to `TAC` (missense mutation, Leu -> Tyr) and has deleted the `GGT` codon entirely. This is an **in-frame deletion** of one amino acid (Glycine) plus a missense mutation.\n    *   **Impact:** The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another one changed. Like a simple missense mutation, this may or may not eliminate function.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth Mutant 2 (nonsense) and Mutant 3 (frameshift) are highly likely to knock out the gene's function. However, the nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most definitive and direct. It introduces a stop signal at the very beginning of the protein sequence, guaranteeing the production of a tiny, non-functional peptide. This is the most reliable way among the given options to ensure the anti-nutritional compound is no longer synthesized.\n\n<<<B>>>"
