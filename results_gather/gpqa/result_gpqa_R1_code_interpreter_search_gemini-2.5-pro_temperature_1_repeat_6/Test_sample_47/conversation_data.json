    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclohexanone, a six-membered cyclic ketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Bromine (Br₂).\n*   **Reaction:** This is the α-halogenation of a ketone. In the presence of an acid or base catalyst (which is usually present or added), the ketone enolizes, and the resulting enol (or enolate) attacks Br₂. The bromine atom adds to the α-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group). Since cyclohexanone is symmetric, both α-positions (C2 and C6) are equivalent.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n\n*   **Reactant:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), a strong base, with heat.\n*   **Reaction:** For an α-halo ketone treated with a strong base, two major pathways are possible: E2 elimination or the Favorskii rearrangement.\n    *   **E2 Elimination:** The hydroxide ion could abstract a proton from the β-carbon (C3) to the bromine, leading to the formation of cyclohex-2-en-1-one.\n    *   **Favorskii Rearrangement:** The hydroxide ion abstracts an acidic α-proton from the other side of the carbonyl group (C6). The resulting enolate then performs an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the carbon with the bromine (C2) and displacing the bromide ion. This forms a strained bicyclic intermediate, bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one. The hydroxide then attacks the carbonyl carbon of this intermediate, leading to the opening of the three-membered ring. This ring-opening occurs in a way that forms the most stable carbanion, which results in a ring contraction. The product of the Favorskii rearrangement of 2-bromocyclohexanone is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (after acidic workup, which is implied).\n\n*   **Which pathway is more likely?** While both are possible, the subsequent reaction steps strongly suggest the Favorskii rearrangement is the intended pathway. This is a classic named reaction, and the resulting carboxylic acid leads to a logical sequence of reactions in the following steps. The E2 pathway leads to subsequent products whose properties do not match the options provided.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Reagent:** Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂), a standard reagent for converting carboxylic acids to acid chlorides. Pyridine is a weak base used to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Reaction:** The -OH group of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a -Cl atom.\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OᵗBu)₃)**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OᵗBu)₃). This is a bulky, mild reducing agent.\n*   **Reaction:** This specific reagent is known for the selective reduction of acid chlorides to aldehydes. It is not strong enough to reduce the aldehyde further to an alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\n\nNow we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. Chemical distinctness is determined by the molecule's symmetry. If two hydrogens cannot be interchanged by a symmetry operation (like rotation or reflection), they are chemically distinct and will produce separate signals in an NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Structure:** A five-membered cyclopentane ring with an aldehyde group (-CHO) attached to one of the carbons.\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry (a Cₛ plane). This plane passes through the aldehyde group (C=O and H), the carbon of the ring it's attached to (C1), and bisects the bond between C3 and C4.\n*   **Effect of Symmetry:**\n    *   This plane of symmetry makes C2 equivalent to C5.\n    *   It also makes C3 equivalent to C4.\n\nLet's count the sets of distinct hydrogens:\n\n1.  **Aldehyde H:** The single hydrogen atom of the -CHO group. It lies on the plane of symmetry and is unique. (1 type)\n2.  **C1-H:** The single hydrogen atom on the carbon attached to the aldehyde group. It also lies on the plane of symmetry and is unique. (1 type)\n3.  **C2/C5 Hydrogens:** Carbons C2 and C5 are equivalent. Each has two hydrogens. These two hydrogens on C2 are not equivalent to each other; they are diastereotopic because the carbon is prochiral. Replacing one versus the other with a different atom would create a diastereomer. The same is true for C5. Due to the plane of symmetry, the \"upper\" H on C2 is equivalent to the \"upper\" H on C5, and the \"lower\" H on C2 is equivalent to the \"lower\" H on C5. This gives us two distinct sets of hydrogens from these four. (2 types)\n4.  **C3/C4 Hydrogens:** Carbons C3 and C4 are equivalent. Similar to the C2/C5 case, the two hydrogens on C3 are diastereotopic, as are the two on C4. The symmetry makes the corresponding hydrogens equivalent. This gives us another two distinct sets of hydrogens. (2 types)\n\n**Total Count:**\nSumming up the different types of hydrogens:\n1 (aldehyde) + 1 (on C1) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = **6** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\nTherefore, product 4 has 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<B>>>"
