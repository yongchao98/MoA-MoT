    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analysis of the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The combination of this C=O peak and the broad O-H peak is a strong indicator of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch.\n\n2.  **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens (hydrogens attached to the carbons of a double bond) confirms the presence of a C=C double bond, which supports the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analysis of the Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a classic and very common fragment for carboxylic acids. This fragment corresponds to the [COOH]⁺ cation (Carbon = 12, Oxygen = 16, Hydrogen = 1; Total mass = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45).\n\n4.  **Integration of the Spectroscopic Data:**\n    *   The combined data from all three techniques strongly indicates that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid that also contains a C=C double bond.\n    *   A carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) contains two oxygen atoms. This information allows us to immediately eliminate options A (C6H10O) and D (C6H12O), as they only contain one oxygen atom.\n    *   We are now left with two possibilities: B) C6H10O2 and C) C6H12O2.\n\n5.  **Using the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    The Degree of Unsaturation (also known as the index of hydrogen deficiency) tells us the total number of pi bonds and rings within a molecule. The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2), where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens.\n    *   From our spectral analysis, we know the molecule must contain at least one C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid) and one C=C double bond. This means the molecule must have a Degree of Unsaturation of at least 2.\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n        *   **For B) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This value is consistent with the presence of one C=O bond and one C=C bond.\n        *   **For C) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This value is not consistent with the presence of both a C=O and a C=C bond. A molecule with this formula could be a carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), but it could not also contain a C=C double bond.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only chemical formula that accounts for all the experimental evidence (a carboxylic acid group and a C=C double bond) is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
