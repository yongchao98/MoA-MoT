    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Compound Information:**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This means we have a benzene ring (C6H4) with two groups attached to it.\n    *   **\"8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents together must contain 2 carbon atoms (8 - 6 = 2).\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum... presence of a carbonyl group (C=O)\"**: One of the substituents must contain a C=O functional group.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum... presence of an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: One of the substituents is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly attached to the aromatic ring. Let's denote it as -X.\n\n2.  **Determine the Molecular Structure:**\n    *   We have a halogen (-X) as one substituent.\n    *   The second substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n    *   Two plausible structures for this second substituent are:\n        *   An acetyl group: -C(=O)CH3. This is a ketone.\n        *   A formylmethyl group: -CH2CHO. This is an aldehyde.\n    *   This gives us two possible candidate molecules:\n        *   **Candidate 1**: A haloacetophenone (Structure: X-C6H4-COCH3). This has 8 carbons, a carbonyl, a halogen on the ring, and is di-substituted.\n        *   **Candidate 2**: A (halophenyl)acetaldehyde (Structure: X-C6H4-CH2CHO). This also has 8 carbons, a carbonyl, a halogen on the ring, and is di-substituted.\n\n3.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Options:**\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum is highly unlikely. A di-substituted benzene ring typically has 4 aromatic protons, and the splitting patterns and integrations here do not match. Ruled out.\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum has no signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm). Since the compound is aromatic, this option is incorrect. Ruled out.\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **Aromatic Region:** The two doublets at 7.8 ppm (2H) and 7.6 ppm (2H) are characteristic of a para (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring, indicating a high degree of symmetry.\n        *   **Aliphatic Region:** The singlet at 2.3 ppm integrating to 3H is a classic signal for a methyl group (-CH3) next to a carbonyl (an acetyl group, -COCH3).\n        *   **Overall Fit:** This spectrum perfectly matches the structure of a **para-haloacetophenone**. The electron-withdrawing carbonyl group deshields the aromatic protons, pushing their chemical shifts downfield (to higher ppm values like 7.6-7.8 ppm). The chemical shifts are all consistent with this structure.\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   **Aromatic Region:** Like option B, this shows a para-disubstituted pattern.\n        *   **Functional Group/Aliphatic Region:** The singlet at 9.9 ppm (1H) is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The singlet at 3.7 ppm (2H) is characteristic of a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to the ring (a benzylic position).\n        *   **Overall Fit:** This spectrum suggests the structure of **para-(halophenyl)acetaldehyde**.\n        *   **Inconsistency Check:** Let's check the chemical plausibility. An aldehyde group attached via a methylene (-CH2CHO) is an electron-withdrawing group, but its effect on the ring is insulated by the CH2 spacer. It is significantly less deactivating than a directly attached carbonyl group (-COCH3). Therefore, it would not shift the aromatic protons as far downfield as 7.6-7.8 ppm. The expected chemical shifts for the aromatic protons in this compound would be closer to 7.1-7.4 ppm. The shifts provided (7.8 and 7.6 ppm) are inconsistent with the proposed -CH2CHO substituent.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    Option B presents a 1H NMR spectrum that is fully consistent with a plausible structure (para-haloacetophenone) that fits all the criteria given in the problem. Option D describes a spectrum with an internal inconsistency between the aromatic chemical shifts and the proposed substituent. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
