    "The user wants to find the energy and degeneracy of the third excited state for a particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential.\n\n**1. Understand the System and its Energy Spectrum**\n\nThe potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. In Cartesian coordinates, $r^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$, so the potential is $V(x,y,z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$.\n\nThis potential is separable, meaning it can be written as a sum of three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillator potentials:\n$V(x,y,z) = V(x) + V(y) + V(z)$, where $V(q) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 q^2$ for $q=x,y,z$.\n\nThe Hamiltonian for the system is also separable: $H = H_x + H_y + H_z$.\nThe total energy eigenvalue $E$ is the sum of the energy eigenvalues of the three independent 1D harmonic oscillators:\n$E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z}$\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for a 1D harmonic oscillator are given by $E_k = (k + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $k=0, 1, 2, ...$ is the quantum number.\n\nTherefore, the total energy is:\n$E = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n$E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\nLet's define a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are non-negative integers (0, 1, 2, ...). The energy formula becomes:\n$E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n**2. Identify the Energy of the Third Excited State**\n\nWe need to find the energy for the third excited state. Let's list the energy levels starting from the ground state:\n\n*   **Ground State:** The lowest possible energy corresponds to the smallest value of $n$. Since $n_x, n_y, n_z \\ge 0$, the minimum value is $n = 0+0+0 = 0$.\n    $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n\n*   **First Excited State:** The next energy level corresponds to $n=1$.\n    $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n\n*   **Second Excited State:** The next energy level corresponds to $n=2$.\n    $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n\n*   **Third Excited State:** The third excited state corresponds to $n=3$.\n    $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n\nSo, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n**3. Determine the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State**\n\nThe degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ is the number of different combinations of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that result in the same value of $n$. For the third excited state, we need to find the number of ways to choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$.\n\nWe can list the possible combinations:\n1.  One quantum number is 3, the others are 0:\n    *   (3, 0, 0)\n    *   (0, 3, 0)\n    *   (0, 0, 3)\n    This gives 3 possible states.\n\n2.  One quantum number is 2, one is 1, and one is 0:\n    *   (2, 1, 0)\n    *   (2, 0, 1)\n    *   (1, 2, 0)\n    *   (0, 2, 1)\n    *   (1, 0, 2)\n    *   (0, 1, 2)\n    This gives 6 possible states.\n\n3.  All three quantum numbers are 1:\n    *   (1, 1, 1)\n    This gives 1 possible state.\n\nThe total number of states (which is the degeneracy) is the sum of these possibilities:\nDegeneracy = 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.\n\nThe number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for a given energy eigenvalue is equal to the degeneracy of that energy level.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$, and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions possible for this energy eigenvalue. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
