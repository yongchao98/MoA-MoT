    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the given reaction.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Starting Material**\n\n*   **Name:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n*   **Core Structure:** \"7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane\" represents a cyclohexane ring fused with an epoxide ring. The epoxide is between carbons C1 and C6, and the oxygen is designated as position 7.\n*   **Substituents:** There are methyl groups on C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The configuration of the chiral centers is given as 1R, 3R, 4R, 6S.\n\n**2. Draw the Starting Material**\n\nTo visualize the reaction, we'll draw a planar representation of the cyclohexane ring. The stereochemistry is indicated with wedges (up) and dashes (down).\n\n*   Let's assume the epoxide ring is on the \"up\" face of the cyclohexane ring (represented by wedged bonds to the oxygen at C7).\n*   **C1:** To have an **R** configuration, the methyl group at C1 must be \"down\" (dashed).\n    *   Priorities: O(7) > C6 > C2 > -CH3. With the lowest priority group (-CH3) pointing away (down), the path from O -> C6 -> C2 is clockwise, which corresponds to R.\n*   **C6:** To have an **S** configuration, the hydrogen atom at C6 must be \"up\" (wedged).\n    *   Priorities: O(7) > C1 > C5 > -H. With the lowest priority group (-H) pointing towards us (up), the path from O -> C1 -> C5 is clockwise. A clockwise path with the lowest priority group pointing towards the viewer indicates an S configuration.\n*   **C3:** To have an **R** configuration, the methyl group must be \"up\" (wedged).\n    *   Priorities: C4 > C2 > -CH3 > -H. With H down, the path C4 -> C2 -> -CH3 is clockwise, which is R.\n*   **C4:** To have an **R** configuration, the methyl group must be \"up\" (wedged).\n    *   Priorities: C3 > C5 > -CH3 > -H. With H down, the path C3 -> C5 -> -CH3 is clockwise, which is R.\n\n**Summary of Starting Material Structure:**\n*   Epoxide oxygen is **up**.\n*   C1-Methyl is **down**.\n*   C3-Methyl is **up**.\n*   C4-Methyl is **up**.\n*   C6-Hydrogen is **up**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Me2CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. The nucleophile is the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Nucleophilic opening of an epoxide.\n*   **Regioselectivity:** The problem states that the alkyl group (methyl) attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n    *   C1 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to C2, C6, O, and a methyl group).\n    *   C6 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to C1, C5, O, and a hydrogen).\n    *   Therefore, C6 is the less hindered carbon, and the nucleophilic attack will occur at **C6**.\n*   **Stereoselectivity:** The problem states that **inversion of configuration** occurs at the carbon where the nucleophile attacks. This is a classic SN2-type backside attack.\n    *   The C6-O bond is on the \"up\" face of the ring.\n    *   The Me⁻ nucleophile must attack from the opposite face, which is the \"down\" side.\n\n**4. Predict the Product Structure**\n\n1.  The Me⁻ nucleophile attacks C6 from the **down** side.\n2.  The C6-O bond breaks, and the configuration at C6 inverts. The starting configuration at C6 is S, so the new configuration will be **R**.\n3.  The attacking methyl group will be attached on the **down** side of the ring.\n4.  The oxygen atom, which was bonded to C1 and C6, remains bonded to C1 and now carries a negative charge. Upon aqueous workup, it is protonated to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group. Since the original C1-O bond was \"up\", the resulting -OH group at C1 will also be **up**.\n5.  The configurations of the other chiral centers (C1, C3, C4) are not involved in the reaction and remain unchanged.\n\n**5. Determine the IUPAC Name and Stereochemistry of the Product**\n\n*   **Structure:** The product is a cyclohexanol.\n*   **Numbering:** According to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the principal functional group (-OH) is assigned C1. This is the original C1 of the starting material. We then number the ring to give the other substituents the lowest possible locants. The next substituent is on the adjacent carbon (original C6).\n    *   New C1 = Original C1\n    *   New C2 = Original C6\n    *   New C3 = Original C5\n    *   New C4 = Original C4\n    *   New C5 = Original C3\n    *   New C6 = Original C2\n*   **Substituents:** There are methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n*   **Name:** The base name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options C and D.\n\n*   **Stereochemistry:**\n    *   **New C1 (Original C1):** The configuration was **R** and is unchanged. So, we have **1R**. (-OH is up, -Me is down).\n    *   **New C2 (Original C6):** The configuration inverts from **S** to **R**. So, we have **2R**. (The new -Me is down).\n    *   **New C4 (Original C4):** The configuration was **R** and is unchanged. So, we have **4R**. (-Me is up).\n    *   **New C5 (Original C3):** The configuration was **R** and is unchanged. So, we have **5R**. (-Me is up).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
