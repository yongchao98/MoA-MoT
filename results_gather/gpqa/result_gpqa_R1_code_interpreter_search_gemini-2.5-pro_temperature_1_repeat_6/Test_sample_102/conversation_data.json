    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's identify its structure:\n*   A benzene ring.\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n*   A bromine atom (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n\nAll three substituents are *meta* to each other (1,3,5 substitution pattern). This is a key feature that will guide the synthesis strategy.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), existing substituents on the benzene ring direct incoming groups to specific positions.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromine atom (-Br):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate Simple, Direct Synthetic Routes**\n\nA common strategy is to add the groups one by one. Let's consider the most logical direct route, even if it's not an option, to establish a baseline.\n\n*   **Route X (Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination):**\n    1.  **Acylation:** Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone. (The -COCH3 group is a *meta*-director).\n    2.  **Nitration:** Acetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Nitroacetophenone. (The -COCH3 group directs the -NO2 group to the *meta* position).\n    3.  **Bromination:** 3-Nitroacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. (The ring now has two *meta*-directors: -COCH3 at position 1 and -NO2 at position 3. Both direct the incoming Br+ to position 5).\n\nThis three-step synthesis is highly regioselective and would produce the desired product. Although the final bromination step might be slow because the ring is deactivated by two groups, it is chemically sound. Since this sequence is not among the options, it implies a more complex route is required, likely one that circumvents potential issues like low reactivity or side reactions. The presence of reagents for reduction (Fe/HCl) and diazotization/deamination (NaNO2/HCl, H3PO2) in the options strongly suggests a strategy involving a temporary amino directing group.\n\n**4. Analyze the Given Options**\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on established principles of organic synthesis.\n\n*   **Option A:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...\n    *   Step (i) gives nitrobenzene. Step (ii) gives aniline. Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3) on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group (-NH2), forming a strongly deactivating complex (-NH2+AlCl3), which prevents the acylation of the ring. Therefore, this sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...\n    *   Step (i) gives bromobenzene. Step (ii) is the nitration of bromobenzene. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director. This step produces a mixture of 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene and 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene, with only a tiny amount of the *meta* isomer (1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene). This violates the \"high-yield\" requirement of the question. Therefore, this sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2...\n    *   This sequence as written is nonsensical. Steps (i) through (iv) convert benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, then to a diazonium salt, and finally, H3PO2 removes the diazonium group, converting it back to benzene. This futile cycle makes the option incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2\n    This sequence is long and complex, suggesting it might employ an advanced strategy. Let's analyze it step-by-step:\n    1.  **i) Benzene → Acetophenone:** Friedel-Crafts acylation. (OK)\n    2.  **ii) Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone:** Bromination. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director. (OK)\n    3.  **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone → 3-Bromo-4-nitroacetophenone:** Nitration. Here we have competing directors: -COCH3 (*meta*) and -Br (*ortho, para*). The -Br group is less deactivating, so it primarily controls the position of substitution, directing the nitro group to its *ortho* and *para* positions. The major product would be the *ortho* isomer (relative to Br), 3-bromo-4-nitroacetophenone, as the other ortho position is sterically hindered. This step is regioselective for an intermediate, not the final product.\n    4.  **iv) 3-Bromo-4-nitroacetophenone → 3-Bromo-4-aminoacetophenone:** Reduction of the nitro group with Fe/HCl. (OK)\n    5.  **v) 3-Bromo-4-aminoacetophenone → 3-Bromo-4-amino-5-nitroacetophenone:** Nitration. This is the key step. The directing effects are:\n        *   -NH2 (at 4): A powerful activating *ortho, para*-director. It directs to position 5 (*ortho*).\n        *   -COCH3 (at 1): A *meta*-director. It directs to position 5.\n        *   -Br (at 3): An *ortho, para*-director.\n        The powerful activating -NH2 group, reinforced by the -COCH3 group, strongly directs the new nitro group to position 5. This step should be high-yield and highly regioselective (assuming conditions prevent full protonation of the amine).\n    6.  **vi) 3-Bromo-4-amino-5-nitroacetophenone → Diazonium salt:** Diazotization of the amino group at position 4 with NaNO2/HCl. (OK)\n    7.  **vii) Diazonium salt → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one:** Deamination (removal of the diazonium group) with H3PO2. Removing the group at position 4 leaves the acetyl (1), bromo (3), and nitro (5) groups in the desired 1,3,5-pattern.\n\nThis sequence represents a sophisticated synthetic strategy where a nitro group is temporarily introduced, converted to a powerful amino directing group to control the placement of the final substituent, and then removed. Although complex, each step is logical and contributes to the high-yield synthesis of the specific isomer.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOption B outlines a valid, albeit intricate, synthetic route that correctly manipulates directing group effects to achieve the desired 1,3,5-substitution pattern in high yield. The other options contain fatal chemical flaws.\n\n<<<B>>>"
