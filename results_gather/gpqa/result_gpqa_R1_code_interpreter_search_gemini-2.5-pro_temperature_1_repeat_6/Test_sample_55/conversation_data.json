    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Process\n\nThe problem asks about the decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (also known as the 3s state) to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ (the 1s ground state) via a two-step dipole transition. We need to identify a valid transition route and its corresponding probability.\n\nA \"dipole transition\" refers to an electric dipole (E1) transition, which is the most common type of radiative transition in atoms.\n\n### 2. Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules\n\nE1 transitions are governed by a set of selection rules for the quantum numbers $|n, l, m\\rangle$:\n*   **$\\Delta l = \\pm 1$**: The orbital angular momentum quantum number must change by exactly 1.\n*   **$\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$**: The magnetic quantum number can change by 0 or 1.\n*   **$\\Delta n$ can be any integer**: The principal quantum number is not restricted, but for a decay (emission), the energy must decrease, so $n$ must decrease.\n\n### 3. Analyzing the Transition Path\n\nA direct transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden by the E1 selection rules because for this transition, $\\Delta l = 0 - 0 = 0$, which violates the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule.\n\nTherefore, the decay must happen in at least two steps, via an intermediate state $|n', l', m'\\rangle$. This is called a cascade decay.\n\n**Step 1: Decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to an intermediate state $|n', l', m'\\rangle$**\n\n*   **Initial state:** $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$. Here, $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n*   Applying the selection rules for the first transition:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l' - l = l' - 0 = \\pm 1 \\implies l' = 1$. The intermediate state must be a p-state.\n    *   For a decay, the energy must decrease, so $n' < n$. Since $n=3$, possible values for $n'$ are 1 or 2. An intermediate state with $l'=1$ must have $n' \\ge 2$. Therefore, the only possible intermediate state has $n'=2$. So, the intermediate state is a $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state (a 2p state).\n    *   $\\Delta m = m' - m = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1 \\implies m' = 0, 1, -1$.\n\nSo, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n**Step 2: Decay from the intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$**\n\n*   **Intermediate state:** $|i'\\rangle = |2,1,m'\\rangle$. Here, $n'=2, l'=1$.\n*   **Final state:** $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$. Here, $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n*   Let's check if this transition is allowed:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies the $\\Delta l=\\pm1$ rule.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_f - m' = 0 - m' = -m'$. For this to be allowed, we need $-m' \\in \\{0, 1, -1\\}$, which is true for all possible intermediate states ($m' \\in \\{0, 1, -1\\}$).\n\nConclusion: The decay must proceed via a cascade:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$, where $m'$ can be -1, 0, or 1. All the routes presented in the options (A, C, D) are physically possible.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Probability (Branching Ratio)\n\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific route. This refers to the branching ratio of the cascade. The overall probability of a specific route is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n\n**Probability of Step 1: $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle)$**\n\n*   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric (since $l=0$).\n*   The decay is spontaneous emission, which is isotropic (it has no preferred direction).\n*   The three possible intermediate states, $|2,1,-1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle, |2,1,1\\rangle$, are degenerate in energy (in the absence of external fields).\n*   Due to the spherical symmetry of the initial state and the isotropy of the interaction, the transition probability to each of the degenerate final substates must be equal.\n*   There are 3 possible final substates. Therefore, the probability of decaying into any single one of them is $1/3$.\n    *   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = 1/3$\n    *   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n    *   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n    (This is relative to the total decay rate from 3s to 2p).\n\n**Probability of Step 2: $P(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle)$**\n\n*   Once the atom is in a $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state (a 2p state), it needs to decay to a lower energy level.\n*   The only state with energy lower than 2p that is accessible via an E1 transition is the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state (1s state). Decay to any other state is either energetically forbidden or violates selection rules.\n*   Therefore, the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state will decay to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state with a probability of 1 (or a branching ratio of 100%).\n\n**Overall Probability of a Specific Route**\n\nThe total probability for a specific route is $P(\\text{Step 1}) \\times P(\\text{Step 2})$.\nFor the route $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$:\nProbability = $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nThe same logic applies to the other possible routes via $|2,1,1\\rangle$ and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$. Their probabilities are also $1/3$.\n\n### 5. Comparing with the Options\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on our findings:\n\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**\n    *   The route is valid. The calculated probability is $\\frac{1}{3}$. This option is correct.\n\n*   **B) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$**\n    *   The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**\n    *   The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect (it should be $\\frac{1}{3}$).\n\n*   **D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**\n    *   The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect (it should be $\\frac{1}{3}$).\n\nTherefore, the only correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
