    "**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the System:** We have a neutral spherical conductor with a cavity. A positive charge `+q` is placed inside this cavity. We need to find the electric field at a point P outside the conductor.\n\n2.  **Principle of Electrostatic Induction:** The presence of the charge `+q` inside the cavity will cause the mobile charges (electrons) within the conductor to redistribute.\n    *   A charge of `-q` will be attracted to the inner surface of the cavity, arranging itself to cancel the field of `+q` within the conductor's material.\n    *   Since the conductor was initially uncharged, and a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a net charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the conductor to maintain overall charge neutrality.\n\n3.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** A key principle of electrostatics is **electrostatic shielding**. The charges on the inner surface (`-q`) and the charge within the cavity (`+q`) arrange themselves in such a way that their combined electric field is zero everywhere outside the cavity. This means the charge distribution on the outer surface is completely unaffected by the position of the cavity or the charge inside it. Because the outer surface is a perfect sphere, the induced charge `+q` will distribute itself **uniformly** over the outer surface.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Electric Field Outside:** The total electric field at point P is the superposition of the fields from all charges:\n    *   The original charge `+q` inside the cavity.\n    *   The induced charge `-q` on the inner surface of the cavity.\n    *   The induced charge `+q` on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n5.  **Applying the Shielding Concept:** As stated in step 3, the net electric field at point P due to the original charge `+q` and the induced inner surface charge `-q` is zero. Therefore, the electric field at point P is determined solely by the charge `+q` that is uniformly distributed on the outer spherical surface.\n\n6.  **Field of a Uniformly Charged Sphere:** According to Gauss's Law (or the shell theorem), the electric field at an external point (a point outside the sphere) due to a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere.\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   The center of the outer spherical conductor is O.\n    *   The distance from the center O to the point P is `L`.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:** Using the formula for the electric field of a point charge, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{Total Charge}}{\\text{(distance from center})^2}$\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n8.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$: Incorrect. This ignores the shielding effect of the conductor.\n    *   B) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$: Correct. This matches our derivation based on electrostatic shielding and the shell theorem.\n    *   C) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$: Incorrect.\n    *   D) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$: Incorrect.\n\nThe parameters `r`, `s`, `l`, and `Î¸` are provided but are irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor. They serve as distractors. The only relevant quantities are the charge `q` and the distance `L` from the center of the outer conductor.\n\n<<<B>>>"
