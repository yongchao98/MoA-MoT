    "To determine which stars are detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph, we need to check two conditions for each star:\n1.  **Observability**: The star must be visible in the sky from the Paranal Observatory in Chile.\n2.  **Brightness**: The star's apparent magnitude must be less than or equal to the limiting magnitude of the instrument for the specified observation parameters.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Observability and Brightness Criteria**\n\n*   **Observability from Paranal:** The Paranal Observatory is located at a latitude of approximately -24.6°. A star is observable if its declination (DEC) allows it to rise above the horizon. The theoretical declination range for visibility is `DEC < 90° - |Latitude|`, which for Paranal is `DEC < 90° - 24.6° = +65.4°`. Any star with a declination south of this limit is observable.\n\n*   **Brightness Limit (Apparent Magnitude):** The problem asks for detectability with a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 10 in a 1-hour exposure. The provided link states: \"ESPRESSO aims at a S/N of 10 per binned pixel ... in 1 hour for a ... star of V = 16.5 mag using the 4UT mode.\"\n    There is a conflict in the problem statement: it mentions using \"one of the 8m VLT telescopes\" (which is 1-UT mode, with a limiting magnitude closer to V=12), but the provided reference link only gives the value for the 4-UT mode (V=16.5). Using the 1-UT value of V=12 would result in only 1 detectable star (Canopus), which is not among the options. Therefore, we must assume the question intends for us to use the value from the provided link, despite the inconsistency.\n    *   **Limiting Apparent Magnitude (m_V): 16.5**\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Each Star**\n\n*   **a) Canopus:**\n    *   **Observability:** Canopus has a declination of approximately -52°. Since -52° is less than +65.4°, it is **observable** from Paranal.\n    *   **Brightness:** Its apparent magnitude is -0.74. Since -0.74 ≤ 16.5, it is **detectable**.\n\n*   **b) Polaris:**\n    *   **Observability:** Polaris has a declination of approximately +89°. Since +89° is greater than +65.4°, it is never visible above the horizon at Paranal. It is **not observable**.\n    *   **Brightness:** Not detectable because it is not observable.\n\n*   **c) Star with M_V = 15, d = 10 pc:**\n    *   **Observability:** It has a declination of 0°. Since 0° is less than +65.4°, it is **observable**.\n    *   **Brightness:** We calculate its apparent magnitude (m_V) using the distance modulus formula: `m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5`.\n        `m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(10) - 5 = 15 + 5 * 1 - 5 = 15.0`.\n        Since 15.0 ≤ 16.5, it is **detectable**.\n\n*   **d) Star with M_V = 15, d = 200 pc:**\n    *   **Observability:** Declination is 0°, so it is **observable**.\n    *   **Brightness:** `m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(200) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5 * 2.301 - 5 = 15 + 11.505 - 5 = 21.51`.\n        Since 21.51 > 16.5, it is **not detectable**.\n\n*   **e) Star with M_V = 15, d = 5 pc:**\n    *   **Observability:** Declination is 0°, so it is **observable**.\n    *   **Brightness:** `m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(5) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5 * 0.699 - 5 = 15 + 3.495 - 5 = 13.50`.\n        Since 13.50 ≤ 16.5, it is **detectable**.\n\n*   **f) Star with M_V = 15, d = 50 pc:**\n    *   **Observability:** Declination is 0°, so it is **observable**.\n    *   **Brightness:** `m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(50) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5 * 1.699 - 5 = 15 + 8.495 - 5 = 18.50`.\n        Since 18.50 > 16.5, it is **not detectable**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe stars that are detectable are:\n1.  Canopus (a)\n2.  Star with d = 10 pc (c)\n3.  Star with d = 5 pc (e)\n\nIn total, 3 stars are detectable. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
