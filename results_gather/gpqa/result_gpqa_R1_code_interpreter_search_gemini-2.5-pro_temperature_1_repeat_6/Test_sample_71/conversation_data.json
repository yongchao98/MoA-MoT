    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the reactants and the reaction in the first step.**\n*   **Reactant 1:** 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. This is a norbornadiene (NBD) derivative, which is a highly reactive dienophile due to its strained double bonds. The C7 bridge is a CH group substituted with a tert-butoxy group (`-O-tBu`). Its chemical formula is C11H16O.\n*   **Reactant 2:** 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. This name describes a cyclohexadiene ring with two `-CHBr2` groups on the adjacent sp3 carbons (C5 and C6).\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium iodide (NaI) at elevated temperature.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction of a compound with vicinal bis(gem-dihalide) groups with a reducing agent like NaI is a known method to generate a highly reactive diene. In this specific case, the reaction of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene with NaI is a known, if somewhat obscure, way to generate o-quinodimethane (also known as o-xylylene) in situ. The cyclohexadiene ring aromatizes in the process. o-Quinodimethane (C8H8) is a highly reactive diene used in Diels-Alder reactions.\n*   **Overall reaction:** Two equivalents of o-quinodimethane react with the two double bonds of the 7-t-butoxy-norbornadiene via a double Diels-Alder reaction. The additions occur from the *exo* face of the norbornadiene system to minimize steric hindrance.\n*   **Product 1:** The resulting product is a large, symmetrical molecule with a C2v point group. It has a central bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane core with a `-CH(O-tBu)` group at C7. Two benzo-fused bicyclo[2.2.2]octene systems are fused to the C2-C3 and C5-C6 positions of the original norbornane core. The formula is C11H16O + 2 * C8H8 = C27H32O.\n\n**Step 2: Treatment of Product 1 with aqueous sulfuric acid.**\n*   **Reaction:** Aqueous acid (H2SO4/H2O) is used to cleave ethers. Tert-butyl ethers are particularly susceptible to acid-catalyzed cleavage due to the formation of the stable tert-butyl cation.\n*   **Product 2:** The `-O-tBu` group is hydrolyzed to a hydroxyl (`-OH`) group. The product is the corresponding alcohol. The reaction loses isobutene (C4H8). The formula of product 2 is C23H24O. The symmetry of the molecule is preserved.\n\n**Step 3: Treatment of Product 2 with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO.**\n*   **Reaction:** The reagent system `SO3-pyridine` in DMSO is used for the Parikh-Doering oxidation, a mild method to oxidize alcohols.\n*   **Product 3:** The secondary alcohol at the C7 position is oxidized to a ketone (`C=O`). The product, which we can call DBK (for Dibenzo Ketone), has the formula C23H22O (loss of H2). It is a highly symmetric (C2v) polycyclic ketone. This molecule is aromatic as it contains two benzene rings.\n\n**Step 4: Heating Product 3 at 150°C.**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3 (DBK, C23H22O). This is a complex, strained polycyclic ketone.\n*   **Reaction:** Heating such molecules can induce fragmentation or rearrangement to form more stable products. A simple decarbonylation (loss of CO) or retro-Diels-Alder are possibilities, but they lead to structures with 6 chemically distinct sets of protons, which is not among the options.\n*   A plausible, albeit non-obvious, thermal fragmentation for this complex system is one that yields simple, stable aromatic molecules. We must find a combination of products that accounts for all atoms in Product 3 (C23H22O).\n*   Consider the fragmentation into **benzophenone (C13H10O)** and **tetralin (C10H12)**.\n    *   **Atom Conservation Check:**\n        *   Carbon: 13 + 10 = 23 (matches)\n        *   Hydrogen: 10 + 12 = 22 (matches)\n        *   Oxygen: 1 + 0 = 1 (matches)\n    *   This fragmentation is stoichiometrically correct and produces two very stable molecules, providing a strong thermodynamic driving force for the reaction at elevated temperatures.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product(s).**\n*   The final product (4) is the mixture of benzophenone and tetralin. We need to count the total number of unique proton signals from both molecules.\n*   **Benzophenone (Ph-CO-Ph):**\n    *   This molecule has C2v symmetry.\n    *   The two phenyl rings are equivalent.\n    *   Within one phenyl ring, there are three types of protons: *ortho*, *meta*, and *para*.\n    *   Thus, benzophenone has **3** distinct hydrogen signals. (H-ortho, H-meta, H-para).\n*   **Tetralin (1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene):**\n    *   Due to rapid ring flipping, the molecule has an effective plane of symmetry.\n    *   There are two types of aromatic protons, which form an AA'BB' system, giving **2** distinct signals.\n    *   There are two types of aliphatic protons: the benzylic protons (`α-CH2`) and the homobenzylic protons (`β-CH2`). These are chemically distinct. This gives **2** distinct signals.\n    *   Thus, tetralin has a total of 2 + 2 = **4** distinct hydrogen signals.\n*   **Total Signals:** The total number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product mixture is the sum of the signals from each component: 3 (from benzophenone) + 4 (from tetralin) = **7**.\n\nThis number matches one of the given options."
