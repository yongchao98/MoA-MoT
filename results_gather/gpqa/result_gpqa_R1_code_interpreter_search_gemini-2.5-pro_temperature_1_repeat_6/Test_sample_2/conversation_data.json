    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the State Vector**\n\nThe spin-half particle is in a quantum state `|ψ⟩`, which is a linear superposition of the spin-up `|↑⟩` and spin-down `|↓⟩` states.\nThe state is given by:\n`|ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩`\n\nIn the standard basis where `|↑⟩` and `|↓⟩` are the eigenstates of `σz`, we can represent them as column vectors:\n`|↑⟩` corresponds to the vector `[1, 0]^T`\n`|↓⟩` corresponds to the vector `[0, 1]^T`\n\nSo, the state vector `|ψ⟩` can be written as:\n`|ψ⟩ = 0.5 * [1, 0]^T + (√3/2) * [0, 1]^T = [0.5, √3/2]^T`\n\nThe corresponding bra vector `⟨ψ|` is the conjugate transpose of `|ψ⟩`. Since the components are real, it is just the transpose:\n`⟨ψ| = [0.5, √3/2]`\n\nWe should check if the state is normalized:\n`⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (0.5)^2 + (√3/2)^2 = 0.25 + 3/4 = 0.25 + 0.75 = 1`\nThe state is correctly normalized.\n\n**2. Define the Operator**\n\nThe operator for which we need to find the expectation value is `O = 10σz + 5σx`.\nThe Pauli matrices `σz` and `σx` in the standard basis are:\n`σz = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`\n`σx = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\n\nNow, we construct the operator `O`:\n`O = 10 * [[1, 0], [0, -1]] + 5 * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\n`O = [[10, 0], [0, -10]] + [[0, 5], [5, 0]]`\n`O = [[10, 5], [5, -10]]`\n\n**3. Calculate the Expectation Value**\n\nThe expectation value of an operator `O` for a state `|ψ⟩` is given by the formula `⟨O⟩ = ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩`.\n\nWe can calculate this in two ways.\n\n**Method 1: Direct Matrix Multiplication**\n\nFirst, calculate the action of the operator `O` on the state `|ψ⟩`:\n`O|ψ⟩ = [[10, 5], [5, -10]] * [0.5, √3/2]^T`\n`O|ψ⟩ = [(10 * 0.5) + (5 * √3/2), (5 * 0.5) + (-10 * √3/2)]^T`\n`O|ψ⟩ = [5 + 2.5√3, 2.5 - 5√3]^T`\n\nNow, multiply by the bra vector `⟨ψ|`:\n`⟨O⟩ = ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [5 + 2.5√3, 2.5 - 5√3]^T`\n`⟨O⟩ = 0.5 * (5 + 2.5√3) + (√3/2) * (2.5 - 5√3)`\n`⟨O⟩ = 2.5 + 1.25√3 + (2.5√3 / 2) - (5 * (√3)^2 / 2)`\n`⟨O⟩ = 2.5 + 1.25√3 + 1.25√3 - (5 * 3 / 2)`\n`⟨O⟩ = 2.5 + 2.5√3 - 7.5`\n`⟨O⟩ = -5 + 2.5√3`\n\n**Method 2: Using the Linearity of Expectation Value**\n\nThe expectation value of a sum of operators is the sum of their individual expectation values:\n`⟨O⟩ = ⟨10σz + 5σx⟩ = 10⟨σz⟩ + 5⟨σx⟩`\n\nFirst, calculate `⟨σz⟩ = ⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩`:\nThe coefficients of `|↑⟩` and `|↓⟩` are `c_up = 0.5` and `c_down = √3/2`.\n`⟨σz⟩ = |c_up|^2 - |c_down|^2 = (0.5)^2 - (√3/2)^2 = 0.25 - 3/4 = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5`\n\nNext, calculate `⟨σx⟩ = ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩`:\n`σx|ψ⟩ = σx * (0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩) = 0.5|↓⟩ + (√3/2)|↑⟩`\n`⟨σx⟩ = (0.5⟨↑| + (√3/2)⟨↓|) * ( (√3/2)|↑⟩ + 0.5|↓⟩ )`\n`⟨σx⟩ = (0.5 * √3/2) + (√3/2 * 0.5) = √3/4 + √3/4 = 2√3/4 = √3/2`\n\nNow, combine the results:\n`⟨O⟩ = 10 * (-0.5) + 5 * (√3/2)`\n`⟨O⟩ = -5 + 2.5√3`\n\n**4. Numerical Calculation**\n\nBoth methods yield the same result: `⟨O⟩ = -5 + 2.5√3`.\nTo get the final numerical value, we can use a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# The state is |psi> = 0.5|up> + sqrt(3)/2|down>\nc_up = 0.5\nc_down = np.sqrt(3) / 2\n\n# Operator O = 10*sigma_z + 5*sigma_x\n# Expectation value <O> = 10*<sigma_z> + 5*<sigma_x>\n\n# <sigma_z> = |c_up|^2 - |c_down|^2\nexp_sigma_z = c_up**2 - c_down**2\n\n# <sigma_x> = 2 * Re(c_up* * c_down)\nexp_sigma_x = 2 * np.real(np.conj(c_up) * c_down)\n\n# Total expectation value\nexp_O = 10 * exp_sigma_z + 5 * exp_sigma_x\n\n# Print the result rounded to one decimal place\nprint(f\"{exp_O:.1f}\")\n```\n-0.7\n\nThe calculation confirms that the expectation value is `⟨O⟩ = -5 + 2.5√3 ≈ -0.67`. Rounded to one decimal place, this is -0.7.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\nA) -0.7\nB) -1.4\nC) 1.65\nD) 0.85\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
