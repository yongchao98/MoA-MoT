    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   Let `S` be the stationary frame of reference, which is the laboratory where the observer is located.\n    *   Let `S'` be the moving frame of reference, which is the rest frame of the glass block.\n\n2.  **Identify the Velocities:**\n    *   The velocity of the moving frame `S'` (the glass) relative to the stationary frame `S` (the lab) is `v`. The problem states the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam. Let's take this common direction as positive. So, the velocity of the glass is `+v`.\n    *   The velocity of the light beam as measured within its medium (the glass) is `u'`. This is the velocity of light relative to the moving frame `S'`. The index of refraction `n` is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum (`c`) to the speed of light in the medium (`u'`).\n        *   `n = c / u'`\n    *   The problem specifies that the speed of light in a vacuum `c = 1`.\n        *   Therefore, `n = 1 / u'`, which gives `u' = 1/n`. Since the beam propagates in the same direction as the glass moves, `u'` is also positive.\n    *   We need to find the speed of light in the glass as measured by the observer in the laboratory. This is the velocity of the light beam relative to the stationary frame `S`, which we will call `u`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    The formula for adding velocities in special relativity is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n    This formula calculates the velocity `u` of an object in frame `S` when its velocity `u'` in a moving frame `S'` is known, and the frame `S'` is moving with velocity `v` relative to `S`.\n\n4.  **Substitute the Known Values:**\n    We substitute `u' = 1/n` and `c = 1` into the velocity addition formula:\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\n5.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    `u = ( 1/n + v ) / ( 1 + v/n )`\n    To get rid of the fractions in the numerator and denominator, we can multiply both by `n`:\n    `u = n * ( 1/n + v ) / n * ( 1 + v/n )`\n    `u = ( n * (1/n) + n * v ) / ( n * 1 + n * (v/n) )`\n    `u = ( 1 + n*v ) / ( n + v )`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The derived expression for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer is `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`.\n    Let's check the given options:\n    A) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\n    B) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n    C) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n    D) 1\n\n    Our result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
