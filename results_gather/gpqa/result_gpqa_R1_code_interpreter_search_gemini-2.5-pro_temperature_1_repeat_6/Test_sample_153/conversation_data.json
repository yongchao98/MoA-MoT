    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+) Peak:** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates that the molecular weight of the most abundant isotopologue of the compound is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotopic Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 has an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak (which is 100%). This M+ to M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 (100:32 ≈ 3:1) is the characteristic isotopic signature for a molecule containing one chlorine atom (due to the natural abundance of its isotopes, ~75% ³⁵Cl and ~25% ³⁷Cl).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This very broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The significant broadening is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This peak is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, a C=O stretch for a carboxylic acid is expected between 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The presence of both the broad O-H and the C=O peak strongly indicates the functional group is a carboxylic acid.\n\n**3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis:**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (δ > 10 ppm) is characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid. Its integration of 1H confirms it's a single proton, and its multiplicity as a singlet (s) is expected as it has no adjacent protons to couple with.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (δ 7-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets (d), each integrating to two protons (2H), is a classic sign of a *para*-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The symmetry of the molecule makes the two protons ortho to one substituent equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the other substituent also equivalent. This leads to the two-doublet pattern.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure:**\n\n*   From MS, we know the molecule contains one chlorine atom.\n*   From IR and ¹H NMR, we know it contains a carboxylic acid group.\n*   From ¹H NMR, we know these two groups are arranged in a *para* (1,4) configuration on a benzene ring.\n\nThe only structure that fits all these pieces of evidence is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\nLet's verify this against the options:\n\n*   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** Matches all data. MW is 156/158, it's a carboxylic acid, and it's para-substituted.\n*   **B) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Wrong functional groups (aldehyde and phenol, not carboxylic acid) and wrong substitution pattern (1,2,3-trisubstituted, which would give a more complex NMR spectrum).\n*   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** While it is a chlorobenzoic acid, the *ortho* (1,2) substitution would result in a complex aromatic region with four distinct signals in the ¹H NMR, not two doublets.\n*   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** Wrong functional group (chloroformate, no O-H for the broad IR peak or the acidic NMR proton) and substitution pattern (monosubstituted ring would have a different NMR spectrum).\n\nTherefore, the compound is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the integer masses for the M+ and M+2 peaks of 4-chlorobenzoic acid (C7H5ClO2)\n# Atomic masses (integer): C=12, H=1, O=16, 35Cl=35, 37Cl=37\n\nmass_C = 7 * 12\nmass_H = 5 * 1\nmass_O = 2 * 16\nmass_Cl35 = 35\nmass_Cl37 = 37\n\n# M+ peak with 35Cl\nm_plus_peak = mass_C + mass_H + mass_O + mass_Cl35\n\n# M+2 peak with 37Cl\nm_plus_2_peak = mass_C + mass_H + mass_O + mass_Cl37\n\nprint(f\"Calculated m/z for M+ peak: {m_plus_peak}\")\nprint(f\"Calculated m/z for M+2 peak: {m_plus_2_peak}\")\n```\n<execute_output>\nCalculated m/z for M+ peak: 156\nCalculated m/z for M+2 peak: 158\n</execute_output>\n\nThe calculation confirms that the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂ matches the mass spectrometry data perfectly.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Based on the comprehensive analysis of the provided spectral data:\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS):** The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 and a significant M+2 peak at m/z = 158 with about one-third the intensity (32%) is a classic isotopic pattern for a compound containing a single chlorine atom. The Python script confirmed that the molecular weight for 4-chlorobenzoic acid (C₇H₅³⁵ClO₂) is indeed 156 amu, and for C₇H₅³⁷ClO₂, it is 158 amu.\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:** The combination of a very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ (characteristic of an O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid) and a strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ (a C=O stretch) is definitive evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The singlet at 11.0 ppm integrating to 1H is the signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The two doublets in the aromatic region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm), each integrating to 2H, indicate a *para*-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The symmetry of this substitution pattern results in only two types of aromatic protons, which split each other into doublets.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nPutting all the evidence together, the unknown compound is a benzoic acid with a chlorine atom attached. The NMR spectrum specifically points to a *para* substitution pattern. Therefore, the structure is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<A>>>"
