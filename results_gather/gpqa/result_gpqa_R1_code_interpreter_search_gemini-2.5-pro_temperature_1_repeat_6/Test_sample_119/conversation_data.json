    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Define the fundamental assumption:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ`, is constant throughout space. `ρ` represents the number of stars per unit volume.\n\n2.  **Relate the number of stars to volume and distance:** Consider a thin spherical shell of space centered on the observer. Let the inner radius of this shell be `d` and the outer radius be `d + dd`.\n    *   The volume of this thin shell (`dV`) is approximately its surface area multiplied by its thickness: `dV = 4πd² dd`.\n    *   The number of stars (`dN`) within this shell is the volume of the shell multiplied by the constant star density `ρ`:\n        `dN = ρ * dV = 4πρd² dd`\n\n3.  **Introduce Parallax (plx):** Parallax is inversely proportional to the distance `d`. The standard astronomical formula is:\n    `plx = 1/d`\n    (where `plx` is in arcseconds and `d` is in parsecs).\n\n4.  **Express `d` and `dd` in terms of `plx`:** We need to find how the number of stars `dN` changes with a change in parallax `d(plx)`. To do this, we must substitute the distance variables (`d`, `dd`) in our equation for `dN` with parallax variables.\n    *   From `plx = 1/d`, we get `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   Now, we need to find the relationship between the thickness of the shell `dd` and the corresponding interval of parallax `d(plx)`. We can find this by differentiating `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `d = (plx)⁻¹`\n        `dd/d(plx) = -1 * (plx)⁻² = -1/plx²`\n        `dd = -(1/plx²) d(plx)`\n\n5.  **Interpret the negative sign:** The negative sign indicates that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. When we are considering the number of stars in a given range (a physical count), it must be a positive quantity. So, we are interested in the magnitude of the relationship:\n    `|dd| = (1/plx²) d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Substitute the parallax expressions back into the equation for `dN`:**\n    *   Our equation is `dN = 4πρd² |dd|`.\n    *   Substitute `d = 1/plx` and `|dd| = (1/plx²) d(plx)`.\n    *   `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) d(plx)`\n    *   `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) d(plx)`\n\n7.  **Find the number of stars per unit range of parallax:** The question asks for \"how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx\". This quantity is mathematically represented as `dN/d(plx)`.\n    *   From the equation in the previous step, we can divide by `d(plx)`:\n        `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\n8.  **Determine the proportionality:** Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, we can see the proportionality relationship:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to the inverse of the parallax to the fourth power.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) ~ 1/plx¹\nB) ~ 1/plx²\nC) ~ 1/plx⁴\nD) ~ 1/plx³\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
