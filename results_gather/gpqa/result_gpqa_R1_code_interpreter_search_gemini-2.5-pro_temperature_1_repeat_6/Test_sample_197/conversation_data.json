    "The problem asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\nFirst, let's identify the species in the solution. We have the free cobalt(II) ion, `Co^2+`, and a series of complexes formed with the thiocyanate ligand, `SCN^-`. The formation of these complexes is described by their overall stability constants (β).\n\nThe relevant equilibria are:\n1.  `Co^2+ + SCN^- <=> [Co(SCN)]^+` with `β1 = [[Co(SCN)]^+] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]) = 9`\n2.  `Co^2+ + 2SCN^- <=> [Co(SCN)2]` with `β2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^2) = 40`\n3.  `Co^2+ + 3SCN^- <=> [Co(SCN)3]^-` with `β3 = [[Co(SCN)3]^-] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^3) = 63`\n4.  `Co^2+ + 4SCN^- <=> [Co(SCN)4]^2-` with `β4 = [[Co(SCN)4]^2-] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^4) = 16`\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all cobalt-containing species:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [[Co(SCN)]^+] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]^-] + [[Co(SCN)4]^2-]`\n\nWe can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free `Co^2+` concentration, `[SCN^-]`, and the stability constants:\n*   `[[Co(SCN)]^+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)2]] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^2`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)3]^-] = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^3`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)4]^2-] = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^4`\n\nSubstituting these into the total cobalt concentration equation:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + β1[Co^2+][SCN^-] + β2[Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 + β3[Co^2+][SCN^-]^3 + β4[Co^2+][SCN^-]^4`\nFactoring out `[Co^2+]`:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4)`\n\nThe mole fraction (α) of a specific complex `[Co(SCN)n]^(2-n)` is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration. We are interested in the mole fraction of the dithiocyanato complex, `α2`:\n`α2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)`\n`α2 = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4))`\n\nThe `[Co^2+]` term cancels out:\n`α2 = (β2 * [SCN^-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4)`\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   `[SCN^-] = 0.1` M\n*   `β1 = 9`\n*   `β2 = 40`\n*   `β3 = 63`\n*   `β4 = 16`\n\nLet's calculate the terms in the denominator:\n*   `1`\n*   `β1 * [SCN^-] = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9`\n*   `β2 * [SCN^-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n*   `β3 * [SCN^-]^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063`\n*   `β4 * [SCN^-]^4 = 16 * (0.1)^4 = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016`\n\nThe denominator is the sum of these terms:\nDenominator = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\nThe numerator is the term for the dithiocyanato complex:\nNumerator = `β2 * [SCN^-]^2 = 0.4`\n\nNow, calculate the fraction `α2`:\n`α2 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\nTo get the percentage, we multiply by 100:\nPercentage = `0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%`\n\nThis matches the result from the code execution (`16.916...%`). Comparing this to the given options:\n\nA) 42.3%\nB) 25.6%\nC) 16.9%\nD) 38.1%\n\nThe calculated percentage matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
