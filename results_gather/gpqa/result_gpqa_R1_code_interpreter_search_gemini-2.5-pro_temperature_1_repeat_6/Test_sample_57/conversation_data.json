    "The user is asking to identify which of the given physical theories does not require regularization at high energies. Let's analyze each option.\n\n**Regularization** is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergent integrals that appear in calculations of physical quantities. These divergences often occur at high energies (or short distances), and are known as ultraviolet (UV) divergences.\n\n1.  **A) Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory describes the behavior of electric and magnetic fields. While not a quantum field theory, it has its own divergence problems. For instance, the self-energy of a classical point-like electron is infinite. This indicates a breakdown of the theory at very short distances (high energies) and implies that some form of cutoff or \"regularization\" is needed, which ultimately points to the necessity of a more fundamental theory (like Quantum Electrodynamics).\n\n2.  **B) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** This is the quantum theory of electromagnetism. When calculating interactions using perturbation theory (Feynman diagrams), integrals over loop momenta often diverge at high momentum limits. Regularization (e.g., dimensional regularization, Pauli-Villars regularization, or introducing a momentum cutoff) is an essential step to make these integrals mathematically meaningful before applying renormalization to obtain finite physical predictions. Therefore, QED absolutely requires regularization.\n\n3.  **C) Superstring Theory:** This is a candidate for a unified theory of everything. One of its most celebrated features is that it is believed to be a UV-finite theory. Unlike point-particle theories (like QED and QCD), in string theory, the fundamental entities are one-dimensional strings. The interactions are not point-like but are \"smeared out\" over the finite extent of the string. This smearing effect naturally tames the high-energy behavior of loop integrals in scattering amplitudes, preventing the ultraviolet divergences that plague standard quantum field theories. Thus, it is conjectured that superstring theory does not require regularization.\n\n4.  **D) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** This is the quantum field theory of the strong interaction between quarks and gluons. Similar to QED, it is a quantum field theory based on point-like particles. Calculations involving loops in QCD also lead to ultraviolet divergences that must be handled with regularization and subsequent renormalization.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, Classical Electrodynamics has divergence issues at high energy. QED and QCD are quantum field theories that are well-known to require regularization to handle UV divergences. Superstring Theory is specifically proposed as a framework that avoids these high-energy divergences due to the extended nature of strings, and thus it is believed not to require regularization.\n\n<<<C>>>"
