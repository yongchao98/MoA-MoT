    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Initial State (t < 0)\n\n*   The particle is spin-1/2, and its magnetic moment `μ` is related to its spin `S` by the vector relation `μ_vec = γ * S_vec`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio. The problem states `μ = γ*Sz` which is a shorthand for the z-component `μ_z = γ * S_z`.\n*   Initially, there is a magnetic field `B_vec = B * z_hat` (in the +Z direction).\n*   The Hamiltonian of the system is `H_initial = -μ_vec . B_vec = - (γ * S_z) * B = -γB * S_z`.\n*   The particle is \"aligned\" with the field, which means it is in the lowest energy eigenstate of `H_initial`.\n*   The spin operator `S_z` has two eigenvalues: `+ħ/2` (spin up) and `-ħ/2` (spin down).\n*   The corresponding energy levels are:\n    *   `E_up = -γB * (+ħ/2) = -γBħ/2` for the spin-up state `|+z>`.\n    *   `E_down = -γB * (-ħ/2) = +γBħ/2` for the spin-down state `|-z>`.\n*   Assuming `γ` and `B` are positive, the lowest energy state is the spin-up state `|+z>`.\n*   Therefore, the initial state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`. In the standard basis where `|+z> = [[1],[0]]`, this is our starting point.\n\n### 2. The Change and the New Hamiltonian (t > 0)\n\n*   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is \"suddenly\" switched. The Z-field is turned off, and a new field `B_vec = B * y_hat` (in the +Y direction) is turned on.\n*   \"Suddenly\" means the state of the system does not change at the instant of the switch. So, the state at `t=0+` is still `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n*   For `t > 0`, the system evolves under the new Hamiltonian:\n    `H_new = -μ_vec . B_vec = - (γ * S_y) * B = -γB * S_y`.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Time Evolution of the Expectation Value\n\nWe want to find the oscillation frequency of the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z>(t)`. Since `<μ_z>(t) = γ * <S_z>(t)`, we need to find how `<S_z>(t)` evolves in time. We can use the Heisenberg picture for this.\n\n*   In the Heisenberg picture, the expectation value of an operator `A` evolves according to the equation:\n    `d<A>/dt = (1/iħ) * <[A, H]>` (for an operator `A` with no explicit time dependence).\n\n*   Let's apply this to `A = S_z` and `H = H_new = -γB * S_y`:\n    `d<S_z>/dt = (1/iħ) * <[S_z, -γB * S_y]> = (-γB / iħ) * <[S_z, S_y]>`\n\n*   We use the fundamental commutation relation for spin operators: `[S_i, S_j] = iħ * ε_ijk * S_k`.\n    For our case, `[S_z, S_y] = -[S_y, S_z] = -(iħ * S_x) = -iħ * S_x`.\n\n*   Substituting the commutator back into the equation for `d<S_z>/dt`:\n    `d<S_z>/dt = (-γB / iħ) * (-iħ * <S_x>) = γB * <S_x>`. (Equation 1)\n\n*   This equation shows that the rate of change of `<S_z>` depends on `<S_x>`. We need to find how `<S_x>` changes as well. Let's apply the Heisenberg equation to `A = S_x`:\n    `d<S_x>/dt = (1/iħ) * <[S_x, -γB * S_y]> = (-γB / iħ) * <[S_x, S_y]>`\n\n*   The commutator is `[S_x, S_y] = iħ * S_z`.\n\n*   Substituting this in:\n    `d<S_x>/dt = (-γB / iħ) * (iħ * <S_z>) = -γB * <S_z>`. (Equation 2)\n\n### 4. Solving the Equations of Motion\n\nWe now have a system of two coupled first-order differential equations. Let `ω = γB`.\n1.  `d<S_z>/dt = ω * <S_x>`\n2.  `d<S_x>/dt = -ω * <S_z>`\n\nTo find the oscillation frequency of `<S_z>`, we can combine these equations into a single second-order differential equation.\n*   Differentiate Equation 1 with respect to time:\n    `d²<S_z>/dt² = ω * d<S_x>/dt`\n*   Substitute Equation 2 into this new equation:\n    `d²<S_z>/dt² = ω * (-ω * <S_z>) = -ω² * <S_z>`\n*   Rearranging gives:\n    `d²<S_z>/dt² + ω² * <S_z> = 0`\n\nThis is the standard equation for a simple harmonic oscillator. The general solution is `<S_z>(t) = C₁cos(ωt) + C₂sin(ωt)`. The angular frequency of oscillation is `ω`.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe angular frequency of oscillation for `<S_z>(t)` is `ω`. We defined `ω = γB`.\nThe expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is `<μ_z>(t) = γ * <S_z>(t)`, so it will oscillate with the same frequency.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is `ω = γB`. This phenomenon is known as Larmor precession, where the spin vector precesses around the new magnetic field axis (the Y-axis) with the Larmor frequency `ω = γB`. The projection of this precessing vector onto the Z-axis oscillates at this frequency.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) gamma*B\nB) gamma*B/2\nC) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nD) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n\nThe calculated frequency `γB` matches option A.\n\nWe can also solve this problem using the Schrödinger picture, which involves expressing the initial state `|+z>` as a superposition of the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian `H_new` (which are `|+y>` and `|-y>`), time-evolving the state, and then calculating the expectation value. This method yields the same result: `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`, confirming the oscillation frequency is `γB`."
