    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given compounds exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Fundamental Concept:**\nOptical isomerism occurs in molecules that are **chiral**. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality are:\n1.  The presence of a **chiral center** (or stereocenter), which is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n2.  The presence of **axial chirality**, such as in **atropisomers**. Atropisomers are stereoisomers that can be interconverted by rotation about a single bond, but where the rotation is so restricted by steric hindrance that the individual isomers can be isolated. This is common in substituted biphenyl compounds.\n\nA molecule is **achiral** (and thus does not show optical isomerism) if it has an element of symmetry, such as a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl. The two phenyl rings are linked by a single C-C bond.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   At positions 2 and 2' (ortho to the connecting bond), there are dimethyl dicarboxylate groups (-COOCH₃).\n    *   At positions 6 and 6' (the other ortho positions), there are dinitro groups (-NO₂).\n*   **Analysis of Chirality:**\n    *   In biphenyl systems, if the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6') are occupied by bulky groups, the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings is restricted. This is called steric hindrance.\n    *   Both the methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃) and the nitro group (-NO₂) are large enough to prevent the rings from becoming coplanar.\n    *   This restricted rotation forces the molecule into a twisted, non-planar conformation.\n    *   This conformation does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Its mirror image is non-superimposable.\n    *   This phenomenon is known as **atropisomerism**, a form of axial chirality.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is the methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid (lactic acid). Its chemical formula is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n*   **Analysis of Chirality:**\n    *   We need to check for chiral centers (a carbon atom with four different substituents).\n    *   Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group).\n    *   The four groups attached to this carbon are:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since all four groups are different, this carbon atom is a chiral center.\n    *   A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is a ketone with the formula (C₆H₅)₂C=O. A central carbonyl group is attached to two phenyl rings.\n*   **Analysis of Chirality:**\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers. The central carbon is sp² hybridized (part of a double bond).\n    *   We need to check for elements of symmetry. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   Due to the presence of this plane of symmetry, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n*   **Analysis of Chirality:**\n    *   The molecule is planar. Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself), making it achiral.\n    *   Furthermore, this molecule has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n    *   The presence of these symmetry elements means the molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not show optical isomerism. (Note: It is a geometric isomer, but not an optical isomer).\n\n**Summary:**\n\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (atropisomerism).\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral center).\n*   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n*   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nTherefore, the compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
