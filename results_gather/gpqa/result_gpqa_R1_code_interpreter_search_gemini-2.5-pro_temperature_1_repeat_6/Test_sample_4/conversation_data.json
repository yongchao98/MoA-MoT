    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Define the Operator Components**\n\nThe problem gives the components of the quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$ as:\n*   $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x$\n*   $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y$\n*   $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z$\n\nThese are the components of the spin angular momentum operator $\\vec{S}$ for a spin-1/2 particle like a muon. The matrices $\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$ are the Pauli matrices.\n\n**2. Define the Direction Vector**\n\nThe operator is to be evaluated along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane. In spherical coordinates, a general unit vector $\\vec{n}$ is given by:\n$\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi, \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi, \\cos\\theta)$\n\nFor a vector to be in the x-z plane, its y-component must be zero. This means $\\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi = 0$. Assuming the vector is not solely along the z-axis (where $\\sin\\theta=0$), we must have $\\sin\\phi = 0$, which implies $\\phi = 0$ or $\\phi = \\pi$. By convention, we take $\\phi=0$.\nSo, the unit vector $\\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane is:\n$\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$\nHere, $\\theta$ is the angle the vector $\\vec{n}$ makes with the positive z-axis.\n\n**3. Construct the Operator along direction $\\vec{n}$**\n\nThe operator along the direction $\\vec{n}$, denoted as $P_n$, is the dot product of $\\vec{P}$ and $\\vec{n}$:\n$P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n} = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\nSubstituting the components of $\\vec{P}$ and $\\vec{n}$:\n$P_n = (\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x)(\\sin\\theta) + (\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y)(0) + (\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z)(\\cos\\theta)$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} (\\sigma_x \\sin\\theta + \\sigma_z \\cos\\theta)$\n\nNow, we write this in matrix form:\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\right)$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**4. Set up and Solve the Eigenvalue Equation**\n\nWe need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$. Let the eigenvector be represented by the column vector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalue equation is:\n$P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$\n$\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nWe can cancel the factor $\\hbar/2$ from both sides:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThis matrix equation gives a system of two linear equations:\n1)  $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a \\implies b \\sin\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n2)  $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b \\implies a \\sin\\theta = b(1 + \\cos\\theta)$\n\nFrom equation (1), we can find the ratio $b/a$:\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n\nTo simplify this expression, we use the half-angle trigonometric identities:\n*   $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$\n*   $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $b/a$:\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n\nSo, we have the relationship $b = a \\tan(\\theta/2)$. The eigenvector is of the form:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ a \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix} = a \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**5. Normalize the Eigenvector**\n\nThe eigenvector must be normalized, meaning its norm (length) must be 1. The squared norm is $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1$.\n$|a|^2 + |a \\tan(\\theta/2)|^2 = 1$\n$|a|^2 (1 + \\tan^2(\\theta/2)) = 1$\nUsing the identity $1 + \\tan^2(x) = \\sec^2(x)$:\n$|a|^2 \\sec^2(\\theta/2) = 1$\n$|a|^2 = \\frac{1}{\\sec^2(\\theta/2)} = \\cos^2(\\theta/2)$\n\nAssuming the phase of $a$ is zero (a standard convention), $a$ is real and positive:\n$a = \\cos(\\theta/2)$\n\nNow we can find $b$:\n$b = a \\tan(\\theta/2) = \\cos(\\theta/2) \\times \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\sin(\\theta/2)$\n\nThus, the normalized eigenvector is:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe elements of this eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n\n**6. Compare with Options**\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2))$ - This matches our derived result.\nB) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar)$ - Incorrect. Eigenvectors are dimensionless state vectors.\nC) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2))$ - Incorrect for the same reason.\nD) $(\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta))$ - Incorrect. The arguments should be $\\theta/2$, not $\\theta$.\n\nThe correct answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
