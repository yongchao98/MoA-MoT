    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4³⁻) in a given solution.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of the Solution:**\n    *   Solvent: Water (implied).\n    *   Solutes:\n        *   1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ (Potassium dihydrogen phosphate).\n        *   1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O (Disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate).\n    *   Volume: 200.00 cm³ = 0.200 L.\n    *   Temperature: 25 °C.\n\n3.  **Determine the Initial Species in Solution:**\n    *   KH₂PO₄ is a salt that dissociates completely in water:\n        KH₂PO₄ → K⁺ + H₂PO₄⁻\n    *   Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O is a salt that also dissociates completely in water:\n        Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O → 2Na⁺ + HPO₄²⁻ + 2H₂O\n    *   Therefore, the solution initially contains K⁺, Na⁺, dihydrogen phosphate ions (H₂PO₄⁻), and hydrogen phosphate ions (HPO₄²⁻).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Initial Molar Concentrations of the Phosphate Species:**\n    *   Molarity (M) = Moles of solute / Volume of solution (L).\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar mass.\n\n    *   For KH₂PO₄:\n        *   Mass = 1.00 g\n        *   Molar mass (Mw) = 136.09 g/mol\n        *   Moles of KH₂PO₄ = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol\n        *   Since 1 mole of KH₂PO₄ gives 1 mole of H₂PO₄⁻, the moles of H₂PO₄⁻ are the same.\n        *   Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻, [H₂PO₄⁻] = (1.00 / 136.09) mol / 0.200 L.\n\n    *   For Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O:\n        *   Mass = 1.00 g\n        *   Molar mass (Mw) = 177.99 g/mol\n        *   Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol\n        *   Since 1 mole of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O gives 1 mole of HPO₄²⁻, the moles of HPO₄²⁻ are the same.\n        *   Concentration of HPO₄²⁻, [HPO₄²⁻] = (1.00 / 177.99) mol / 0.200 L.\n\n5.  **Identify the Relevant Chemical Equilibria:**\n    *   The solution contains a weak acid (H₂PO₄⁻) and its conjugate base (HPO₄²⁻). This is a buffer solution.\n    *   The relevant equilibria for phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄) are:\n        1.  H₃PO₄ ⇌ H⁺ + H₂PO₄⁻ (pKa₁)\n        2.  H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻ (pKa₂)\n        3.  HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻ (pKa₃)\n    *   The pH of the solution is primarily controlled by the second equilibrium (the buffer pair).\n    *   The concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is determined by the third equilibrium.\n\n6.  **Formulate a Plan to Calculate [PO₄³⁻]:**\n    *   From the third equilibrium, the acid dissociation constant expression is:\n        Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    *   To find [PO₄³⁻], we need to know Ka₃, [HPO₄²⁻], and [H⁺].\n        [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * [HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺]\n    *   Ka₃ is given (1.8x10⁻¹²).\n    *   We have calculated the initial concentration of [HPO₄²⁻]. Since Ka₃ is very small, we can assume the equilibrium concentration of HPO₄²⁻ is approximately equal to its initial concentration.\n    *   We need to find the hydrogen ion concentration, [H⁺]. We can calculate this from the buffer equilibrium (the second dissociation).\n\n7.  **Calculate the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H⁺]:**\n    *   From the second equilibrium, the acid dissociation constant expression is:\n        Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n    *   Rearranging to solve for [H⁺]:\n        [H⁺] = Ka₂ * [H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    *   Ka₂ is given (6.2x10⁻⁸).\n    *   We have calculated the initial concentrations of [H₂PO₄⁻] and [HPO₄²⁻]. Since Ka₂ is also small, we can use these initial concentrations as a good approximation for the equilibrium concentrations in this calculation.\n\n8.  **Execute the Calculations using a Python script for precision:**\n    *   The script will first calculate the molar concentrations of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻.\n    *   Then, it will use these concentrations and Ka₂ to calculate [H⁺].\n    *   Finally, it will use the calculated [H⁺], the concentration of HPO₄²⁻, and Ka₃ to find the concentration of PO₄³⁻.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nmass_kh2po4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_kh2po4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_na2hpo4_2h2o = 1.00  # g\nmw_na2hpo4_2h2o = 177.99  # g/mol\nvolume = 0.200  # L\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 1: Calculate initial concentrations\nmoles_h2po4 = mass_kh2po4 / mw_kh2po4\nconc_h2po4 = moles_h2po4 / volume\n\nmoles_hpo4 = mass_na2hpo4_2h2o / mw_na2hpo4_2h2o\nconc_hpo4 = moles_hpo4 / volume\n\n# Step 2: Calculate [H+] from the buffer equilibrium (H2PO4- / HPO4^2-)\n# Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4-] => [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-]/[HPO4^2-]\n# We assume equilibrium concentrations are approximately equal to initial concentrations.\nh_plus_conc = Ka2 * (conc_h2po4 / conc_hpo4)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate [PO4^3-] from the third dissociation\n# Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-] => [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]/[H+]\n# We assume [HPO4^2-] at this equilibrium is approximately its initial concentration.\npo4_conc = Ka3 * (conc_hpo4 / h_plus_conc)\n\nprint(f\"{po4_conc:.3e}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\n6.235e-07\n</execute_result>\nThe calculation yields a concentration of 6.235x10⁻⁷ M for the orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻).

    "**Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary objective is to calculate the molar concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) in the given solution.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Solution Components:**\n    *   Volume of solution = 200.00 cm³ = 0.200 L.\n    *   Solute 1: 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄. Its molar mass (Mw) is 136.09 g/mol. In solution, this salt dissociates completely into K⁺ and H₂PO₄⁻ ions.\n    *   Solute 2: 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O. Its molar mass (Mw) is 177.99 g/mol. In solution, this salt dissociates completely into 2Na⁺ and HPO₄²⁻ ions.\n    *   We are given the acid dissociation constants for phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄):\n        *   H₃PO₄ ⇌ H⁺ + H₂PO₄⁻ ; Ka₁ = 7.5x10⁻³\n        *   H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻ ; Ka₂ = 6.2x10⁻⁸\n        *   HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻ ; Ka₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹²\n\n3.  **Determine the Dominant Equilibrium:**\n    *   The solution contains significant amounts of H₂PO₄⁻ (a weak acid) and its conjugate base, HPO₄²⁻. This constitutes a buffer solution.\n    *   The pH of this buffer is primarily governed by the second dissociation equilibrium (related to Ka₂):\n        H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n    *   The concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is determined by the third dissociation equilibrium (related to Ka₃):\n        HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n\n4.  **Formulate a Step-by-Step Calculation Plan:**\n    *   **Step 1: Calculate the initial molar concentrations of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻.**\n        *   Moles = mass / molar mass\n        *   Concentration (Molarity) = moles / volume (in Liters)\n    *   **Step 2: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺] using the buffer equilibrium (Ka₂).**\n        *   The equilibrium expression is Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻].\n        *   Rearranging gives: [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]).\n        *   We can use the initial concentrations calculated in Step 1 as a very good approximation for the equilibrium concentrations because Ka₂ is small.\n    *   **Step 3: Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO₄³⁻] using the third dissociation equilibrium (Ka₃).**\n        *   The equilibrium expression is Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻].\n        *   Rearranging gives: [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺]).\n        *   We use the [H⁺] calculated in Step 2 and the initial concentration of [HPO₄²⁻] (since Ka₃ is extremely small, the amount of HPO₄²⁻ that dissociates is negligible).\n\n5.  **Execute the Calculation using Python:**\n    *   To ensure accuracy and avoid rounding errors, it is efficient to perform these calculations using a script. The script will follow the three steps outlined above.\n\n```python\n# Given values from the problem statement\nmass_kh2po4 = 1.00  # in grams\nmw_kh2po4 = 136.09  # in g/mol\nmass_na2hpo4_2h2o = 1.00  # in grams\nmw_na2hpo4_2h2o = 177.99  # in g/mol\nvolume_L = 0.200  # in Liters (200.00 cm3 = 200.00 mL)\n\n# Acid dissociation constants for H3PO4\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the initial molar concentrations of the buffer components.\n# Moles of H2PO4- from KH2PO4\nmoles_h2po4_minus = mass_kh2po4 / mw_kh2po4\n# Concentration of H2PO4-\nconc_h2po4_minus = moles_h2po4_minus / volume_L\n\n# Moles of HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4.2H2O\nmoles_hpo4_2minus = mass_na2hpo4_2h2o / mw_na2hpo4_2h2o\n# Concentration of HPO4^2-\nconc_hpo4_2minus = moles_hpo4_2minus / volume_L\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] using the Ka2 equilibrium.\n# [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-]\nconc_H_plus = Ka2 * (conc_h2po4_minus / conc_hpo4_2minus)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-] using the Ka3 equilibrium.\n# [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]\nconc_PO4_3minus = Ka3 * (conc_hpo4_2minus / conc_H_plus)\n\n# Print the final result in scientific notation to compare with the options.\nprint(f\"{conc_PO4_3minus:.3e}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\n6.236e-07\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) is 6.236x10⁻⁷ M.
