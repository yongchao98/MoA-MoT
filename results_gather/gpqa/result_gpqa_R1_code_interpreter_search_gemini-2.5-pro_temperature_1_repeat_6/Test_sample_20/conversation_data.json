    "**Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks to identify two compounds from given pairs based on their isomeric properties.\n    *   **Part A:** Identify the compound between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione that does *not* show tautomerism.\n    *   **Part B:** Identify the compound between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate that *will* show optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **Analyze Part A: Tautomerism**\n    *   **Definition of Tautomerism:** Tautomerism is a form of isomerism where isomers (tautomers) can readily interconvert. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which involves the migration of a proton and a shift of a double bond. A key requirement for keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of an α-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on a carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n    *   **Analyze benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n        *   Structure: It's a six-membered ring with a conjugated system of two C=C double bonds and two C=O double bonds. The chemical formula is C₆H₄O₂.\n        *   The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (α-carbons) are part of C=C double bonds. These carbons do not have any hydrogen atoms attached to them that can be abstracted for enolization.\n        *   Conclusion: Since benzoquinone lacks α-hydrogens, it cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Therefore, benzoquinone is the compound that does not show tautomerism.\n    *   **Analyze cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n        *   Structure: It's a six-membered saturated ring with three ketone groups on carbons 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are CH₂ groups.\n        *   The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are α-carbons to the carbonyl groups. Each of these carbons has two α-hydrogens.\n        *   Conclusion: The presence of α-hydrogens allows this compound to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. In fact, it tautomerizes to form phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), which is an aromatic and highly stable enol form. Thus, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione *does* show tautomerism.\n    *   **Result for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n    *   **Definition of Optical Isomerism:** A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality in organic molecules is the presence of a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   **Analyze methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n        *   Structure: `CH₃-CH(OH)-C(=O)OCH₃`.\n        *   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (`-CH(OH)-`). It is bonded to four different groups:\n            1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n            2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n            3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n            4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-C(=O)OCH₃)\n        *   Conclusion: Since the carbon at position 2 is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and is therefore chiral. Thus, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism (it has two enantiomers).\n    *   **Analyze dimethyl fumarate:**\n        *   Structure: `CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃`. It is the *trans* isomer.\n        *   The molecule is planar around the C=C double bond. It does not contain any carbon atom bonded to four different groups (no chiral centers).\n        *   The molecule possesses a center of inversion (a point of symmetry), which makes it achiral. An achiral molecule cannot exhibit optical isomerism.\n        *   Conclusion: Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and will not show optical isomerism.\n    *   **Result for Part B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n4.  **Combine the Results:**\n    *   A (no tautomerism) = benzoquinone\n    *   B (shows optical isomerism) = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\n5.  **Match with Options:**\n    *   A) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate (Incorrect)\n    *   B) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate (Incorrect)\n    *   C) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (Incorrect)\n    *   D) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (Correct)\n\n<<<D>>>"
