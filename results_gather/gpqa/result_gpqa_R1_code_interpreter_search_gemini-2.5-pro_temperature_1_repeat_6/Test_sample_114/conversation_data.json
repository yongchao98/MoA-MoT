    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Physical Principles**\n\nThe problem involves a relativistic collision and annihilation process. The fundamental principles we need to apply are the conservation of energy and the conservation of momentum from the theory of special relativity.\n\n**2. Define the System and Coordinates**\n\n*   Let the horizontal axis be the x-axis. The electron moves from left to right, so its velocity is in the +x direction. The positron moves from right to left, so its velocity is in the -x direction.\n*   The collision produces two photons. One moves \"upper-right\" and the other \"lower-right\". This suggests a symmetric emission with respect to the x-axis. Let the angle of the first photon with the x-axis be `θ`, and the angle of the second photon be `-θ`. The angle *between* the two photons is therefore `2θ`.\n\n**3. List the Initial and Final State Properties**\n\n**Initial State (before collision):**\n*   **Electron:**\n    *   Rest mass: `m_e`\n    *   Lorentz factor: `γ_e = 4`\n    *   Energy: `E_e = γ_e * m_e * c² = 4 * m_e * c²`\n    *   Momentum: The magnitude is `p = m * c * sqrt(γ² - 1)`. So, `p_e = m_e * c * sqrt(4² - 1) = m_e * c * sqrt(15)`. The momentum vector is `(p_e, 0)`.\n*   **Positron:**\n    *   Rest mass: `m_p = m_e`\n    *   Lorentz factor: `γ_p = 2`\n    *   Energy: `E_p = γ_p * m_e * c² = 2 * m_e * c²`\n    *   Momentum: `p_p = m_e * c * sqrt(2² - 1) = m_e * c * sqrt(3)`. Since it moves in the -x direction, the momentum vector is `(-p_p, 0)`.\n\n**Final State (after collision):**\n*   **Photon 1 & Photon 2:**\n    *   They have zero rest mass.\n    *   Their energies are equal: `E_ph1 = E_ph2 = E_ph`.\n    *   For a photon, energy and momentum are related by `E_ph = p_ph * c`, so the magnitude of each photon's momentum is `p_ph = E_ph / c`.\n    *   Momentum vector of Photon 1: `(p_ph * cos(θ), p_ph * sin(θ))`\n    *   Momentum vector of Photon 2: `(p_ph * cos(-θ), p_ph * sin(-θ)) = (p_ph * cos(θ), -p_ph * sin(θ))`\n\n**4. Apply Conservation Laws**\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:**\n    `E_initial = E_final`\n    `E_e + E_p = E_ph1 + E_ph2`\n    `4*m_e*c² + 2*m_e*c² = E_ph + E_ph`\n    `6*m_e*c² = 2*E_ph`\n    `E_ph = 3*m_e*c²`\n\n    Now we can find the magnitude of each photon's momentum:\n    `p_ph = E_ph / c = (3*m_e*c²) / c = 3*m_e*c`\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    `p_initial = p_final`\n\n    *   **y-component:**\n        `p_initial_y = 0`\n        `p_final_y = p_ph * sin(θ) + p_ph * sin(-θ) = p_ph * sin(θ) - p_ph * sin(θ) = 0`\n        The momentum is conserved in the y-direction, which confirms our symmetric angle setup.\n\n    *   **x-component:**\n        `p_initial_x = p_e - p_p = m_e*c*sqrt(15) - m_e*c*sqrt(3)`\n        `p_final_x = p_ph*cos(θ) + p_ph*cos(θ) = 2*p_ph*cos(θ)`\n\n        Now, we equate the initial and final x-momenta:\n        `m_e*c*sqrt(15) - m_e*c*sqrt(3) = 2 * p_ph * cos(θ)`\n\n        Substitute the value of `p_ph` we found:\n        `m_e*c*(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) = 2 * (3*m_e*c) * cos(θ)`\n        `m_e*c*(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) = 6*m_e*c*cos(θ)`\n\n**5. Solve for the Angle**\n\nWe can cancel `m_e*c` from both sides of the equation:\n`sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) = 6 * cos(θ)`\n\nNow, solve for `cos(θ)`:\n`cos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6`\n\nThe angle we need to find is `2θ`. We can calculate this value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the value of cos(theta)\ncos_theta = (math.sqrt(15) - math.sqrt(3)) / 6\n\n# Calculate theta in radians\ntheta_rad = math.acos(cos_theta)\n\n# Convert theta to degrees\ntheta_deg = math.degrees(theta_rad)\n\n# The angle between the photons is 2 * theta\nangle_between_photons = 2 * theta_deg\n\nprint(angle_between_photons)\n```\n<execute_code>\n138.19200305886918\n</execute_code>\n\nThe calculated angle is approximately 138.19 degrees. This value is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",

We can find the momentum `p` using `p = γmv`. A more direct formula is `p = m*c*sqrt(γ² - 1)`.\n    *   Momentum, `p_e = m*c*sqrt(4² - 1) = m*c*sqrt(15)`. Since it moves from the left, its momentum is in the +x direction.\n\n*   **Positron:**\n    *   Lorentz factor, `γ_p = 2`.\n    *   Total energy, `E_p = γ_p * m * c² = 2mc²`.\n    *   Momentum, `p_p = m*c*sqrt(2² - 1) = m*c*sqrt(3)`. Since it moves from the right, its momentum is in the -x direction.\n\n**3. Final State (after annihilation)**\n\n*   Two photons are produced with equal energy, let's call it `E_ph`.\n*   For a photon, the magnitude of its momentum is `p_ph = E_ph / c`.\n*   One photon moves \"upper-right\" and the other \"lower-right\". This implies their trajectories are symmetric with respect to the x-axis. Let `θ` be the angle each photon's direction makes with the x-axis.\n*   The angle *between* the two photons is `2θ`.\n*   The momentum of the first photon is `(p_ph * cos(θ), p_ph * sin(θ))`.\n*   The momentum of the second photon is `(p_ph * cos(θ), -p_ph * sin(θ))`.\n\n**4.

Solve for the Angle**\n\nWe can cancel `mc` from both sides:\n`sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) = 6 * cos(θ)`\n\nNow, solve for `cos(θ)`:\n`cos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6`\n\nThe angle we need to find is `2θ`. We can calculate this using Python.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the value of cos(theta)\ncos_theta = (math.sqrt(15) - math.sqrt(3)) / 6\n\n# Calculate theta in radians using the arccosine function\ntheta_rad = math.acos(cos_theta)\n\n# Convert theta from radians to degrees\ntheta_deg = math.degrees(theta_rad)\n\n# The angle between the photons is 2 * theta\nangle_between_photons = 2 * theta_deg\n\nprint(f\"The angle theta is: {theta_deg:.2f} degrees\")\nprint(f\"The angle between the photons (2*theta) is: {angle_between_photons:.2f} degrees\")\n```\nThe calculation `2 * math.degrees(math.acos((math.sqrt(15) - math.sqrt(3)) / 6))` yields approximately `138.19` degrees.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 172\nB) 96\nC) 138\nD) 74\n\nThe calculated value of 138.19° is closest to 138°.\n\n<<<C>>>",
