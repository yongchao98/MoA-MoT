    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Gas Processing and Identify Products**\n\n    *   The gas mixture from the decomposition is passed through three tubes. We can determine the composition of the gas mixture by analyzing the changes in each tube.\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2):** This is a powerful drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO) via the reaction 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The mass increase of the tube is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n        *   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g.\n        *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n    *   **Remaining Gas C:** After passing through the three tubes, 2.24 L of gas C remains at STP (Standard Temperature and Pressure).\n        *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n\n2.  **Determine the Identity of Gas C and Verify Mass Conservation**\n\n    *   The total mass of the initial salt mixture was 7.20 g. By the law of conservation of mass, this must equal the total mass of the gaseous products.\n    *   Total mass of products = Mass(H₂O) + Mass(O₂) + Mass(C)\n    *   7.20 g = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + Mass(C)\n    *   Mass(C) = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   We can now find the molar mass of gas C:\n        *   Molar Mass(C) = Mass(C) / Moles(C) = 2.80 g / 0.1 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n    *   A gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol that is unreactive towards the reagents in tubes 1, 2, and 3 is diatomic nitrogen (N₂).\n\n    So, the decomposition of the 7.20 g salt mixture produced:\n    *   0.2 mol H₂O\n    *   0.025 mol O₂\n    *   0.1 mol N₂\n\n3.  **Determine the Elemental Composition of the Salts**\n\n    *   The elements in the products (H, O, N) must have come from the original salts A and B. Let's find the total moles of each element.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 2 × Moles(H₂O) = 2 × 0.2 mol = 0.4 mol.\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2 × Moles(N₂) = 2 × 0.1 mol = 0.2 mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = (1 × Moles(H₂O)) + (2 × Moles(O₂)) = (1 × 0.2 mol) + (2 × 0.025 mol) = 0.2 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n    *   The ratio of atoms in the combined salts (A+B) is H : N : O = 0.4 : 0.2 : 0.25. To get a simple integer ratio, we can multiply by 20, which gives H : N : O = 8 : 4 : 5.\n\n4.  **Identify Salts A and B**\n\n    *   The problem states we have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. This means Moles(A) = Moles(B) = n.\n    *   The total moles of atoms (H=0.4, N=0.2, O=0.25) came from `n` moles of A and `n` moles of B.\n    *   The combined formula for one unit of A plus one unit of B is therefore H₈N₄O₅.\n    *   We need to partition these atoms into two plausible, stable salts. Given the elements H, N, and O, ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions are very likely candidates.\n    *   Let's try to form salts using the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺), nitrate ion (NO₃⁻), and nitrite ion (NO₂⁻).\n        *   Salt A: Ammonium nitrate, **NH₄NO₃**. Its formula is N₂H₄O₃.\n        *   Salt B: Ammonium nitrite, **NH₄NO₂**. Its formula is N₂H₄O₂.\n    *   Let's check if the sum of their formulas matches our derived combined formula:\n        *   (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = N₄H₈O₅. This is a perfect match.\n    *   Let's verify this with the reaction stoichiometry. The decomposition of 1 mole of A and 1 mole of B should yield the same ratio of products we found.\n        *   Known decomposition of ammonium nitrite: NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n        *   Known decomposition of ammonium nitrate at ~200°C can be complex, but a known pathway, especially at slightly higher temperatures, is: 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O, which simplifies to NH₄NO₃ → N₂ + 0.5O₂ + 2H₂O.\n    *   Combining the decomposition of 1 mole of each proposed salt:\n        *   (NH₄NO₃) + (NH₄NO₂) → (N₂ + 0.5O₂ + 2H₂O) + (N₂ + 2H₂O)\n        *   Combined Reaction: A + B → 2N₂ + 0.5O₂ + 4H₂O\n    *   The molar ratio of products from this reaction is N₂ : O₂ : H₂O = 2 : 0.5 : 4.\n    *   The molar ratio of products we found experimentally is N₂ : O₂ : H₂O = 0.1 : 0.025 : 0.2.\n    *   Dividing the experimental moles by the smallest value (0.025) gives the ratio: 4 : 1 : 8.\n    *   Multiplying the theoretical reaction ratio by 2 gives: 4 : 1 : 8. The ratios match. All evidence points to salts A and B being ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\n    *   The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (i.e., in one formula unit of each).\n    *   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 3(O) = 2 N + 4 H + 3 O = 9 atoms.\n    *   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 2(O) = 2 N + 4 H + 2 O = 8 atoms.\n    *   **Total atoms** = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
