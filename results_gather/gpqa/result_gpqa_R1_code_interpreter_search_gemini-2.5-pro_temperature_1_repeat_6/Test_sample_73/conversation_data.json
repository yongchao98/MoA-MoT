    "This is a problem about radioactive decay, which is governed by the principles of a memoryless process, best described by the exponential distribution.\n\n**1. Understand the Exponential Distribution of Decay**\n\nRadioactive decay is a classic example of a Poisson process. The time until a single atom decays follows an exponential distribution. The key properties are:\n-   **Probability of Decay (CDF):** The probability that an atom decays by time `t` is given by `P(T <= t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n-   **Probability of Survival (Survival Function):** The probability that an atom has *not* decayed by time `t` is `P(T > t) = e^(-λt)`.\n-   **λ (Lambda):** This is the decay constant, which represents the rate of decay.\n\n**2. Calculate the Decay Constant (λ)**\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32). We can use this information to find λ.\n\n`P(T <= 100) = 0.32`\n`1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`\n`e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32`\n`e^(-100λ) = 0.68`\n\nTo solve for λ, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n`ln(e^(-100λ)) = ln(0.68)`\n`-100λ = ln(0.68)`\n`λ = -ln(0.68) / 100`\n\n**3. Apply the Memoryless Property**\n\nThe most important concept for this problem is the **memoryless property** of exponential distributions. This property means that the probability of the atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already survived.\n\nThe question asks for the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes. Because of the memoryless property, this is exactly the same as the probability that a brand new atom would decay within 150 minutes.\n\nSo, we need to calculate: `P(T <= 150)`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Probability**\n\nUsing the formula for the probability of decay with `t = 150` minutes:\n`Probability = P(T <= 150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`\n\nNow, we substitute the expression for λ we found in Step 2:\n`Probability = 1 - e^((-ln(0.68) / 100) * 150)`\n`Probability = 1 - e^(ln(0.68) * (-150 / 100))`\n`Probability = 1 - e^(ln(0.68) * -1.5)`\n`Probability = 1 - e^(ln(0.68^1.5))` (using the log rule `a*ln(b) = ln(b^a)`)\n`Probability = 1 - 0.68^1.5`\n\nNow, let's perform the final calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The probability of survival until t=100 minutes is 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\nprob_survival_100 = 0.68\n\n# From the survival function S(t) = exp(-lambda*t), we have:\n# 0.68 = exp(-lambda * 100)\n# Taking the natural log of both sides:\n# ln(0.68) = -lambda * 100\n# So, lambda = -ln(0.68) / 100\ndecay_constant_lambda = -math.log(prob_survival_100) / 100\n\n# Due to the memoryless property of exponential decay, the probability of decaying\n# in the next 150 minutes, given it has survived 50 minutes, is the same as the\n# probability of a new atom decaying in 150 minutes.\n# P(decay in next 150 min) = P(T <= 150) = 1 - exp(-lambda * 150)\ntime_interval = 150\nprob_decay_in_150_min = 1 - math.exp(-decay_constant_lambda * time_interval)\n\n# Print the result as a percentage\nprint(f\"{prob_decay_in_150_min * 100:.2f}%\")\n```\n<execute_result>\n43.93%\n</execute_result>\n\nThe calculated probability is approximately 43.93%, which rounds to 44%.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "This is a classic problem involving radioactive decay, which is governed by the principles of a memoryless process described by the exponential distribution.\n\n**1. Determine the Decay Constant (λ)**\n\nThe probability that an atom decays follows the formula:\nP(decay by time t) = 1 - e^(-λt)\nwhere:\n*   `e` is the base of the natural logarithm.\n*   `λ` is the decay constant of the atom.\n*   `t` is the time elapsed.\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32). We can use this to find λ:\n0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)\ne^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32\ne^(-100λ) = 0.68\n\nTo solve for λ, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\nln(e^(-100λ)) = ln(0.68)\n-100λ = ln(0.68)\nλ = -ln(0.68) / 100\n\n**2. Apply the Memoryless Property**\n\nA key feature of radioactive decay is that it is a **memoryless process**. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is completely independent of how long it has already survived.\n\nThe question asks for the probability that the atom will decay in the *next* 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes.
