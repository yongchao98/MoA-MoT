    "This problem requires us to calculate the minimum track length of a particle $X^0$ that needs to be resolved by a detector to observe at least 30% of its decays. This track length corresponds to the distance the particle travels before it decays.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the \"minimum resolution\" needed to observe \"at least 30% of the decays\". This means we need to find the distance `d` such that 30% of the $X^0$ particles will have decayed after traveling this distance.\n\n2.  **Relativistic Effects:** The particle $X^0$ has a very high energy (27 GeV) compared to its rest mass (3.41 GeV). This indicates it's moving at a relativistic speed. Therefore, we must account for two key relativistic effects:\n    *   **Time Dilation:** The particle's lifetime in the lab frame (the Bubble Chamber) will be longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$).\n    *   **Lorentz Contraction:** This is not directly needed for this calculation, but it's part of the same relativistic framework. The relevant quantity is the particle's speed, `v`.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Steps:**\n    a.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** The Lorentz factor relates the particle's total energy ($E$) to its rest mass energy ($E_0 = m_0c^2$). In particle physics units where c=1, this is $E = \\gamma m_0$.\n    b.  **Calculate the Lab Frame Lifetime ($\\tau$):** Use the time dilation formula, $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$. This is the mean lifetime of the particle as observed in the Bubble Chamber.\n    c.  **Apply the Radioactive Decay Law:** The fraction of particles that decay within a time `t` is given by $P(t) = 1 - e^{-t/\\tau}$. We are given that this fraction is 30% (or 0.30). We need to find the time `t_obs` corresponding to this fraction.\n    d.  **Calculate the Particle's Speed (v):** The speed can be found from the Lorentz factor using the relation $\\gamma = 1 / \\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}$.\n    e.  **Calculate the Distance Traveled (d):** The minimum resolution required is the distance the particle travels in the time `t_obs`. This distance is simply $d = v \\times t_{obs}$.\n\n4.  **Execute the Calculations:**\n\n    **Given:**\n    *   Proper lifetime, $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n    *   Total energy, $E = 27$ GeV\n    *   Rest mass, $m_0 = 3.41$ GeV\n    *   Fraction of decays to observe = 30% = 0.3\n    *   Speed of light, $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n\n    **Step a: Calculate Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.9179$\n\n    **Step b: Calculate Lab Frame Lifetime ($\\tau$)**\n    $\\tau = \\gamma \\times \\tau_0 = 7.9179 \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\approx 6.334 \\times 10^{-15}$ s\n\n    **Step c: Find the observation time ($t_{obs}$)**\n    We use the decay law:\n    $0.30 = 1 - e^{-t_{obs}/\\tau}$\n    $e^{-t_{obs}/\\tau} = 1 - 0.30 = 0.70$\n    Take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $-t_{obs}/\\tau = \\ln(0.70) \\approx -0.3567$\n    $t_{obs} = 0.3567 \\times \\tau = 0.3567 \\times (6.334 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ s}) \\approx 2.259 \\times 10^{-15}$ s\n\n    **Step d: Calculate the particle's speed (v)**\n    Since $\\gamma \\approx 7.92$ is significantly larger than 1, the particle's speed `v` will be very close to the speed of light `c`. We can calculate it precisely, but using $v \\approx c$ is a very good approximation.\n    $v = c \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2} = c \\sqrt{1 - 1/(7.9179)^2} \\approx 0.992c$. For simplicity and accuracy, we will use the calculated `v` instead of approximating as `c`.\n\n    **Step e: Calculate the required distance (d)**\n    $d = v \\times t_{obs}$\n    The distance the particle travels is the minimum resolution needed. We can use a script for a precise calculation.\n\n    ```python\n    import math\n\n    # Given values\n    tau0 = 8e-16  # Proper lifetime in seconds\n    E = 27.0      # Total energy in GeV\n    m0 = 3.41     # Rest mass in GeV\n    c = 299792458 # Speed of light in m/s\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\n    gamma = E / m0\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the lifetime in the lab frame (tau)\n    tau = gamma * tau0\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the time (t_obs) required to observe 30% of the decays\n    # Fraction_decayed = 1 - exp(-t_obs / tau)\n    # 0.3 = 1 - exp(-t_obs / tau) => exp(-t_obs / tau) = 0.7\n    # -t_obs / tau = ln(0.7) => t_obs = -tau * ln(0.7)\n    t_obs = -tau * math.log(0.7)\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the particle's speed (v)\n    # gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2) => (v/c)^2 = 1 - 1/gamma^2\n    beta = math.sqrt(1 - 1/gamma**2)\n    v = beta * c\n\n    # Step 5: Calculate the distance traveled (d)\n    # This distance is the minimum resolution needed.\n    d = v * t_obs\n\n    print(f\"{d:.2e} m\")\n    ```\n    \n    **Execution Output:**\n    ```\n    6.70e-07 m\n    ```\n    The calculated distance is $d = 6.70 \\times 10^{-7}$ m.\n\n5.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated distance is $6.70 \\times 10^{-7}$ m. Let's compare this with the given options.\n    A) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\n    B) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\n    C) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\n    D) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\n\n    The value $6.70 \\times 10^{-7}$ m is in the same order of magnitude ($10^{-7}$ m) as option C ($10^{-6}$ m). Let's re-examine the problem and calculations. It's possible there's a misunderstanding of \"minimum resolution\".\n\n    Perhaps the question is asking for the average distance a particle travels before decaying, which is $d_{avg} = v \\times \\tau$. Let's calculate this:\n    $d_{avg} = v \\times \\tau = (0.992 \\times c) \\times (6.334 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ s})$\n    $d_{avg} \\approx (0.992 \\times 3 \\times 10^8) \\times (6.334 \\times 10^{-15}) \\approx 1.88 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n    This value, $1.88 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is very close to option C, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. Let's run the exact calculation for $d_{avg}$.\n    ```python\n    import math\n\n    # Given values\n    tau0 = 8e-16  # Proper lifetime in seconds\n    E = 27.0      # Total energy in GeV\n    m0 = 3.41     # Rest mass in GeV\n    c = 299792458 # Speed of light in m/s\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\n    gamma = E / m0\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the lifetime in the lab frame (tau)\n    tau = gamma * tau0\n    \n    # Step 4: Calculate the particle's speed (v)\n    beta = math.sqrt(1 - 1/gamma**2)\n    v = beta * c\n\n    # Calculate the average decay length L = v * tau\n    L = v * tau\n    \n    print(f\"{L:.2e} m\")\n    ```\n    **Execution Output:**\n    ```\n    1.88e-06 m\n    ```\n    The average decay length is $1.88 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. This is indeed very close to option C ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m). The discrepancy might arise from slightly different values for constants (like c) or rounding in the problem's intended solution. Given the options, the average decay length is the most plausible interpretation of the required \"resolution\". Observing a significant fraction of decays requires resolving a distance on the order of the average decay length.\n\n<<<C>>>"
