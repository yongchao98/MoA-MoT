    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Synthesis of Product 1**\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), Bromine (Br2), Pyridine, and Acetic anhydride.\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents is used to perform an α-bromination of the carboxylic acid. Acetic acid has one α-carbon (the methyl group). The reaction is analogous to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction.\n*   **Product 1:** The bromine atom substitutes one of the α-hydrogens.\n    CH3COOH → Br-CH2-COOH (Bromoacetic acid)\n\n**Step 2: Synthesis of Product 2**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), and sulfuric acid (H2SO4) catalyst.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a classic Fischer esterification, where a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of a strong acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** The hydroxyl group of the carboxylic acid is replaced by an ethoxy group from ethanol.\n    Br-CH2-COOH + CH3CH2OH --(H+)--> Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl bromoacetate)\n\n**Step 3: Synthesis of Product 3**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate) and sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN-), a good nucleophile, attacks the α-carbon and displaces the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 3:** The bromine atom is replaced by a cyano group.\n    Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3 + NaCN → NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate)\n\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate), excess sodium hydride (NaH), and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a multi-step, one-pot reaction sequence.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that removes a proton from the carbon α to both the cyano (-CN) and the ester (-COOEt) groups. These protons are acidic (pKa ≈ 11).\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    2.  **First Alkylation (SN2):** The resulting carbanion attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br⁻\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** The problem states that **excess** NaH is used. This means there is enough base to deprotonate the newly formed product, which still has one acidic α-proton.\n        NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    4.  **Intramolecular Cyclization (SN2):** The carbanion on the α-carbon now attacks the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromine atom. This is an intramolecular SN2 reaction that forms a six-membered ring, which is thermodynamically and kinetically favorable.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted on one carbon (C1) with both a cyano group and an ethoxycarbonyl group. The structure is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the molecule. At room temperature, cyclohexane rings undergo rapid chair-flipping. This rapid interconversion means we consider the time-averaged structure, which possesses a higher degree of symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:**\n          CN\n          |\n        C -- COOCH2CH3\n       / \\\n      CH2 CH2\n     /     \\\n    CH2     CH2\n     \\     /\n      CH2\n\n*   **Symmetry:** The time-averaged molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the quaternary carbon (C1), the opposite carbon (C4), the cyano group, and the ester group. This plane makes the left and right sides of the ring equivalent.\n    *   Ring position C2 is equivalent to C6.\n    *   Ring position C3 is equivalent to C5.\n\n*   **Counting the Signals:** We count the number of chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n    1.  **Ethyl Group (-O-CH2-CH3):**\n        *   The three protons of the **-CH3** group are equivalent due to free rotation. They will produce **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the **-O-CH2-** group are enantiotopic due to the molecular plane of symmetry. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, they are chemically equivalent. They will produce **1 signal**.\n    2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons (10 total):**\n        *   **Protons on C2 and C6 (4H):** The two protons on any single methylene group in the ring (e.g., C2) are diastereotopic (they have different spatial relationships to the substituents on C1). Thus, they are chemically distinct. Because of the plane of symmetry, the protons on C2 are equivalent to their counterparts on C6. This results in one signal for the two \"axial-like\" protons and another signal for the two \"equatorial-like\" protons. This gives **2 signals**.\n        *   **Protons on C3 and C5 (4H):** The same logic applies. The two protons on C3 are diastereotopic. Symmetry makes C3 and C5 equivalent. This gives **2 signals**.\n        *   **Protons on C4 (2H):** C4 lies on the plane of symmetry. However, the two protons on C4 are still diastereotopic relative to the rest of the molecule. They are not equivalent to each other. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n*   **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   From ethyl group: 1 (CH3) + 1 (OCH2) = 2 signals\n    *   From cyclohexane ring: 2 (C2/C6) + 2 (C3/C5) + 2 (C4) = 6 signals\n    *   **Total = 2 + 6 = 8 signals.**\n\nThe 1H NMR spectrum of product 4 will show 8 distinct signals.\n\n<<<A>>>"
