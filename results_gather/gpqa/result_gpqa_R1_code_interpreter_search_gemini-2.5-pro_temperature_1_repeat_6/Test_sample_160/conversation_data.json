    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Definitions of λ1 and λ2:**\n    *   **λ1:** This is the mean free path of the *residual gas molecules*. It represents the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with another gas molecule.\n    *   **λ2:** This is the mean free path of the *beam electrons*. It represents the average distance an electron from the beam travels before it scatters off a residual gas molecule.\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Mean Free Path (MFP):**\n    The mean free path (λ) is determined by the formula:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the target particles (the number of particles per unit volume).\n    *   `σ` (sigma) is the collision cross-section, which is the effective area a target particle presents for a collision to occur.\n\n3.  **Apply the Formula to λ1 and λ2:**\n    *   For **λ1 (gas-gas collision)**: The projectile is a gas molecule, and the targets are other gas molecules. The number density of targets is `n`. The collision cross-section is for gas-gas collisions, let's call it `σ_gg`.\n        λ1 = 1 / (n * σ_gg)\n    *   For **λ2 (electron-gas collision)**: The projectile is an electron, and the targets are the gas molecules. The number density of targets is the same `n`. The collision cross-section is for electron-gas collisions, let's call it `σ_eg`.\n        λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n\n4.  **Compare λ1 and λ2:**\n    To find the relationship between λ1 and λ2, we can take their ratio:\n    λ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (n * σ_gg)]\n    λ2 / λ1 = σ_gg / σ_eg\n\n    This shows that the ratio of the mean free paths is inversely proportional to the ratio of their respective collision cross-sections. To know how λ2 compares to λ1, we must compare `σ_gg` and `σ_eg`.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Collision Cross-Sections (σ):**\n    *   **σ_eg (electron-gas):** An electron is a point-like particle, vastly smaller than a gas molecule. It is also moving at extremely high, relativistic speeds (due to the 1000 kV acceleration). The gas molecules are essentially stationary targets from the electron's perspective. The effective target area (`σ_eg`) is determined by the size of the gas molecule. In a simple model, this cross-section is approximately the physical area of the molecule, σ_eg ≈ π * r², where `r` is the radius of the gas molecule.\n\n    *   **σ_gg (gas-gas):** Here, a gas molecule is colliding with another gas molecule. Both particles have a significant size (`r`), and both are moving. The fact that the target molecules are also moving increases the likelihood of a collision compared to if they were stationary. Standard kinetic theory shows that this effect introduces a factor of √2. The cross-section is larger because it depends on the radii of *both* colliding particles. The collision occurs if their centers come within a distance of `2r`.\n        Therefore, the cross-section for gas-gas collisions is larger than for electron-gas collisions. A standard result from kinetic theory is:\n        σ_gg ≈ √2 * σ_eg\n\n6.  **Calculate the Ratio of Mean Free Paths:**\n    Now substitute the relationship between the cross-sections back into the ratio for λ:\n    λ2 / λ1 = σ_gg / σ_eg ≈ (√2 * σ_eg) / σ_eg\n    λ2 / λ1 ≈ √2\n\n    Since √2 is approximately 1.414, we have:\n    λ2 ≈ 1.414 * λ1\n\n7.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    Based on our finding that λ2 ≈ 1.414 * λ1, let's check the given choices:\n    *   A) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation. (Incorrect)\n    *   B) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1. (Correct, as 1.414 is indeed greater than or equal to 1.22)\n    *   C) λ2 < λ1. (Incorrect, λ2 is larger than λ1)\n    *   D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1. (Incorrect, as 1.414 is not less than 1.22)\n\nThe core principle is that an electron, being much smaller and faster, can travel further on average than a gas molecule before hitting another gas molecule. Therefore, the electron's mean free path (λ2) is longer than the gas molecule's mean free path (λ1). Option B correctly captures this physical reality and provides a reasonable quantitative boundary.\n\n<<<B>>>"
