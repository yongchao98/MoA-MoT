    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify the Weak Acid (G) and Gas (B):**\n    The hydrolysis of product C produces a strong acid (F) and a weak acid (G). Among the common acids formed from the hydrolysis of binary compounds, hydrofluoric acid (HF) is notably a weak acid, whereas HCl, HBr, and HI are all strong acids. This strongly suggests that G is HF.\n    If G is HF, it must have been formed from the atoms of gas B. Therefore, gas B must be fluorine (F₂).\n\n2.  **Identify Solid (A) and Product (C):**\n    The reaction `C + H₂O -> A + F + G` shows that the starting material A is reformed upon hydrolysis of C. This type of reaction, where an element is regenerated from one of its compounds, is characteristic of a disproportionation. The disproportionation of xenon fluorides in water is a well-known example.\n    *   For instance, the hydrolysis of xenon hexafluoride can proceed as: `2XeF₆ + 3H₂O -> Xe + XeO₃ + 12HF`.\n    *   This reaction regenerates xenon (A), and produces hydrofluoric acid (G, weak acid) and xenon trioxide (XeO₃), which dissolves to form xenic acid (H₂XeO₄).\n    *   While xenic acid is technically a weak acid, perxenic acid (H₄XeO₆, formed under different conditions) is a strong acid. It is common in such puzzles for some chemical facts to be simplified. The regeneration of A is the most crucial clue here.\n    *   Therefore, it's highly probable that **A = Xenon (Xe)** and **C = Xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆)**.\n    *   Xenon is a solid at temperatures below -111.7 °C, fitting the description of \"solid A\". The \"bright red\" color of C is likely a distractor or refers to an impure/complex form, as pure XeF₆ is a colorless solid. The stoichiometry of formation (`A + 8B`) is also likely simplified, with the key information being that A reacts with B to form C.\n\n3.  **Identify Gas (D) and Solvent (H):**\n    We are given that gas D reacts with gas B (F₂) in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent.\n    *   `D(g) + F₂(g) -> H(solvent)` (1:1 ratio)\n    *   A simple and common reaction that fits this description is the reaction between hydrogen gas and fluorine gas: `H₂(g) + F₂(g) -> 2HF(l)`.\n    *   The molar ratio of reactants is 1:1. The product, hydrogen fluoride (HF), is a liquid at standard pressure below 19.5 °C and is used as a solvent.\n    *   Therefore, it's very likely that **D = Hydrogen (H₂) ** and **H = Hydrogen Fluoride (HF)**.\n\n4.  **Identify the Hazardous Product (E):**\n    Product E is formed when C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D.\n    *   `C + 2D -> E`\n    *   Substituting our identified compounds: `XeF₆ + 2H₂ -> E`.\n    *   This is a reduction of xenon hexafluoride by hydrogen. The reaction proceeds by removing fluorine atoms as HF.\n    *   `XeF₆ + H₂ -> XeF₄ + 2HF` (uses 1 equivalent of H₂)\n    *   `XeF₆ + 2H₂ -> XeF₂ + 4HF` (uses 2 equivalents of H₂)\n    *   Since the reaction uses 2 equivalents of D (H₂), the product E must be **Xenon difluoride (XeF₂) **.\n    *   XeF₂ is a strong fluorinating and oxidizing agent and is indeed hazardous, fitting the description.\n\n5.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E (XeF₂):**\n    The final step is to determine the point group of the `XeF₂` molecule.\n    *   We can use VSEPR (Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion) theory.\n    *   The central atom is Xenon (Xe), which is in Group 18 and has 8 valence electrons.\n    *   It is bonded to two Fluorine (F) atoms.\n    *   The Lewis structure has two Xe-F single bonds and three lone pairs of electrons on the Xenon atom.\n    *   This gives a total of 5 electron domains (2 bonding pairs + 3 lone pairs) around the central Xe atom.\n    *   The electron geometry for 5 domains is trigonal bipyramidal.\n    *   To minimize repulsion, the three lone pairs occupy the equatorial positions, and the two fluorine atoms occupy the axial positions.\n    *   This arrangement results in a **linear** molecular geometry for XeF₂ (F-Xe-F).\n    *   A symmetric linear molecule (with a center of inversion) belongs to the **D∞h** point group.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of E is D∞h.\n\n<<<A>>>"
