    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Information from the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\nFirst, let's break down the data provided in the question for a 1:1 mixture of two C10H14 compounds.\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are isomers with the formula C10H14. All the options given (tetramethylbenzenes and diethylbenzene) have this formula.\n    *   Tetramethylbenzene: C6H2(CH3)4 -> C6H2 + C4H12 -> C10H14.\n    *   Diethylbenzene: C6H4(C2H5)2 -> C6H4 + C4H10 -> C10H14.\n2.  **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   The presence of two signals means there are two different types of aromatic protons in the mixture.\n    *   Since it's a 1:1 mixture of two compounds, the simplest explanation is that Compound A gives one aromatic singlet and Compound B gives another aromatic singlet at a slightly different chemical shift.\n    *   The 1:1 integration ratio means that the number of protons contributing to each singlet is the same. For tetramethylbenzenes, there are two aromatic protons (C6H2(CH3)4), so each compound would contribute a 2H singlet. This fits the data perfectly.\n3.  **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n    *   These signals come from the methyl (or ethyl) groups.\n    *   This is the spectrum of the *entire mixture*. Since we have a 1:1 mixture of two C10H14 compounds, each having 12 non-aromatic protons, the total integration in this region corresponds to 24 protons.\n    *   Let's calculate the number of protons for each signal based on the 2:1:1 ratio:\n        *   Total ratio parts = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.\n        *   Signal 1 (ratio 2): (2/4) * 24 protons = 12H.\n        *   Signal 2 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24 protons = 6H.\n        *   Signal 3 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24 protons = 6H.\n    *   Therefore, the combined spectrum must show three aliphatic singlets with integrations corresponding to 12 protons, 6 protons, and 6 protons.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectra for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nNow, let's analyze the expected spectrum for each of the given compounds based on their molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has a C2 axis of symmetry passing through carbons 2 and 5.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent due to the C2 symmetry. They will produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        1.  The methyls at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  The methyl at C2 is unique (3H).\n        3.  The methyl at C5 is unique (3H).\n        *   This will produce **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a C2 axis of symmetry passing through the midpoints of the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent due to this symmetry. Equivalent protons do not split each other. They will produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        1.  The methyls at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  The methyls at C2 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   This will produce **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:6, which simplifies to **1:1**.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (4H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The molecule has ethyl groups. Due to spin-spin coupling between the CH2 and CH3 protons, the spectrum will show a **quartet (4H)** and a **triplet (6H)**, not singlets. This compound can be eliminated immediately because the problem states the aliphatic signals are all singlets.\n\n### **Step 3: Identify the Correct Pair of Compounds**\n\nWe need to find a 1:1 mixture of two compounds that gives the observed spectrum:\n*   Aromatic: Two 2H singlets (1:1 ratio).\n*   Aliphatic: Three singlets with integrations 12H, 6H, and 6H (2:1:1 ratio).\n\nLet's test the pairs given in the options. We are looking for a combination whose individual aliphatic signals add up to {12H, 6H, 6H}.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4- (Prehnitene) and 1,2,3,5- (Isodurene):**\n    *   Prehnitene signals: {6H, 6H}\n    *   Isodurene signals: {6H, 3H, 3H}\n    *   Combined: This would give a minimum of three signals {6H+6H, 3H, 3H} = {12H, 3H, 3H} if one set of 6H peaks overlaps. This does not match {12H, 6H, 6H}.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5- (Durene) and 1,2,3,5- (Isodurene):**\n    *   Durene signals: {12H}\n    *   Isodurene signals: {6H, 3H, 3H}\n    *   Combined: The set of signals would be {12H, 6H, 3H, 3H}. This is four signals, not three, and the integrations do not match {12H, 6H, 6H}.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5- (Durene) and 1,2,3,4- (Prehnitene):**\n    *   Durene signals: **{12H}**\n    *   Prehnitene signals: **{6H, 6H}**\n    *   Combined: If we add these signals together, we get exactly the required set of three signals with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. This corresponds to a 2:1:1 ratio.\n    *   Let's check the aromatic region for this pair. Durene gives one 2H singlet, and Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. This matches the experimental data perfectly.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,5- (Isodurene) and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This option is incorrect because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that fits all the spectral data is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
