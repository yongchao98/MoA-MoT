    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference and Given Information:**\n    *   Let the Galaxy's reference frame be **S**.\n    *   Let the supernova ejecta's reference frame be **S'**.\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames is **v = 60,000 km/s**.\n    *   The time elapsed in the ejecta's frame (S') is **Δt' = 50 s**. Since this time is measured by a clock moving with the ejecta, it is the *proper time*.\n    *   The speed of light is **c ≈ 300,000 km/s**.\n\n2.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   The question asks for the distance the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (S). Let's call this distance **d**.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Physics:**\n    *   In any frame of reference, distance is calculated as `distance = velocity × time`.\n    *   To find the distance `d` in the Galaxy frame (S), we need the velocity of the ejecta in frame S (which is `v`) and the time elapsed in frame S (which we'll call `Δt`).\n    *   So, the formula is: **d = v × Δt**.\n\n4.  **Apply the Concept of Time Dilation:**\n    *   According to the theory of special relativity, an observer in a stationary frame (S) will measure time passing more slowly for a moving object (S'). The time measured in the stationary frame (`Δt`) is related to the proper time (`Δt'`) by the time dilation formula:\n        **Δt = γ × Δt'**\n    *   Here, **γ** (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the relative velocity `v`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    *   The formula for the Lorentz factor is: **γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)**.\n    *   First, let's find the ratio `v/c`:\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Now, square this value:\n        `(v/c)² = 0.2² = 0.04`\n    *   Substitute this into the gamma formula:\n        `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Time in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt):**\n    *   Now we can find the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame:\n        `Δt = γ × Δt' = (1 / √(0.96)) × 50 s`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Distance (d):**\n    *   Substitute the expression for `Δt` into our distance formula `d = v × Δt`:\n        `d = v × (γ × Δt')`\n        `d = 60,000 km/s × (1 / √(0.96)) × 50 s`\n    *   We can group `v` and `Δt'` together:\n        `d = (60,000 × 50) / √(0.96)`\n        `d = 3,000,000 / √(0.96) km`\n\n8.  **Compute the Numerical Value:**\n    *   To get the final number, we need to compute `√(0.96)`.\n    *   `√(0.96) ≈ 0.9798`\n    *   `d ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.9798`\n    *   `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n9.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   The calculated value is `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`.\n    *   Let's look at the given options:\n        A) 3,060,000 km\n        B) 2,940,000 km\n        C) 3,000,000 km\n        D) 2,880,000 km\n    *   Our calculated value is extremely close to option A. The small difference (less than 0.1%) is likely due to rounding in the problem's design.\n\n**Alternative Check (Logical Elimination):**\n*   If we ignore relativity, the distance would be `d = v × Δt' = 60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km` (Option C).\n*   However, due to time dilation, the time measured in the Galaxy frame (`Δt`) is *longer* than the time measured in the ejecta's frame (`Δt'`).\n*   Since `Δt > Δt'`, the distance measured in the Galaxy frame (`d = v × Δt`) must be *greater* than the non-relativistic distance of 3,000,000 km.\n*   Looking at the options, only option A (3,060,000 km) is greater than 3,000,000 km. This confirms that A must be the correct answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv = 60000  # km/s, velocity of the ejecta\ndelta_t_prime = 50  # s, proper time in the ejecta's frame\nc = 300000  # km/s, speed of light\n\n# Calculate beta (v/c)\nbeta = v / c\n\n# Calculate beta squared\nbeta_squared = beta**2\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta_squared)\n\n# Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (delta_t)\ndelta_t = gamma * delta_t_prime\n\n# Calculate the distance traveled as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame\ndistance = v * delta_t\n\nprint(f\"{distance:.0f}\")\n```\n<<<A>>>",
    "This problem involves the concept of time dilation from the theory of special relativity. Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   Let the Galaxy's reference frame be **S**. This is the \"stationary\" frame from which we want to measure the distance.\n    *   Let the supernova ejecta's reference frame be **S'**. This is the \"moving\" frame.\n\n2.  **List the Given Information:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames is **v = 60,000 km/s**.\n    *   The time that passes in the moving frame (S') is **Δt' = 50 s**. This is known as the *proper time* because it's measured by a clock that is moving along with the ejecta.\n    *   The speed of light is **c ≈ 300,000 km/s**.\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's frame (S). Let's call this distance **d**.\n\n4.  **Apply the Principles of Special Relativity:**\n    *   The distance `d` in the Galaxy frame is given by the formula `d = v × Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (S).\n    *   Due to time dilation, an observer in the stationary frame (S) will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) than the proper time (`Δt'`) measured in the moving frame (S').\n    *   The relationship is given by the time dilation formula: **Δt = γ × Δt'**, where **γ (gamma)** is the Lorentz factor.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    *   The Lorentz factor is calculated as: **γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)**.\n    *   First, find the ratio `v/c`:\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Now, calculate γ:\n        `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Distance (d):**\n    *   Now we can substitute the expression for `Δt` into our distance formula:\n        `d = v × Δt = v × (γ × Δt')`\n    *   Plug in the numbers:\n        `d = 60,000 km/s × (1 / √(0.96)) × 50 s`\n    *   Rearranging the terms makes the calculation clearer:\n        `d = (60,000 × 50) / √(0.96)`\n        `d = 3,000,000 / √(0.96) km`\n\n7.  **Compute the Final Value:**\n    *   The Python code you ran calculated this value precisely: `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`.\n    *   Comparing this result to the given options:\n        *   A) 3,060,000 km\n        *   B) 2,940,000 km\n        *   C) 3,000,000 km\n        *   D) 2,880,000 km\n    *   The calculated value of 3,061,862 km is extremely close to 3,060,000 km.
