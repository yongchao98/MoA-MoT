    "Here's my thinking process to solve this multi-step chemistry puzzle:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:** I'll break down the user's prompt into individual facts to analyze one by one.\n    *   **Clue 1:** Substance X contains a heavier isotope of one of its elements.\n    *   **Clue 2:** X reacts violently with liquid Y.\n    *   **Clue 3:** A gas W is released, where molecules have an equal number of protons and neutrons.\n    *   **Clue 4:** A precipitate G is formed.\n    *   **Clue 5:** Heating G releases a substance B.\n    *   **Clue 6:** The melting point of B is ~277 K.\n    *   **Clue 7:** The reaction of a keto acid with X yields a product with 2 oxygen atoms.\n    *   **Clue 8:** X and its close analog are common reagents in organic chemistry.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance B:** The most concrete clue is the melting point. 277 Kelvin is approximately 3.85°C. The standard melting point of water (H₂O) is 0°C (273.15 K). The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier isotope of hydrogen (Deuterium, D), is 3.82°C (276.97 K). This is an excellent match.\n    *   **Conclusion:** B is heavy water, D₂O.\n\n3.  **Identify Gas W:** Since D₂O is involved, it's highly likely that other substances also contain Deuterium. Let's test simple gases where the number of protons equals the number of neutrons.\n    *   D₂ (dideuterium gas): A deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits the description perfectly.\n    *   This strengthens the hypothesis that Deuterium is the key isotope.\n    *   **Conclusion:** W is D₂ gas.\n\n4.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    *   From Clue 1 and the identification of B and W, Substance X must contain Deuterium.\n    *   From Clue 8, X and its analog are common organic chemistry reagents. From Clue 7, X acts as a reducing agent (it reduces a keto acid, which has 3 oxygens, to a product with 2 oxygens, a diol). Common hydride reducing agents are Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) and Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Their deuterated analogs would be NaBD₄ and LiAlD₄.\n    *   Let's test these possibilities. The reaction is X reacting with a liquid Y to produce gas W (D₂) and precipitate G. The presence of D₂O and D₂ strongly suggests Y is also D₂O.\n    *   **Test LiAlD₄ (Lithium Aluminum Deuteride):** The reaction with heavy water would be:\n        `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`\n        *   This reaction is known to be extremely violent. (Matches Clue 2).\n        *   It produces D₂ gas (W). (Matches Clue 3).\n        *   It produces Aluminum Deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, which is insoluble and would form a precipitate (G). (Matches Clue 4).\n        *   Heating the precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) would cause decomposition: `2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. This releases substance B (D₂O). (Matches Clue 5).\n        *   LiAlH₄ (the analog) is a powerful reducing agent that reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids. A keto acid (R-CO-R'-COOH, 3 oxygens) would be reduced to a diol (R-CH(OH)-R'-CH₂(OH), 2 oxygens). (Matches Clue 7).\n    *   **Test NaBD₄:** The reaction `NaBD₄ + 4D₂O → NaOD + B(OD)₃ + 4D₂` produces soluble products. No precipitate (G) would form. This rules out NaBD₄.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Substance X is LiAlD₄.\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:** The final step is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   **Elements in LiAlD₄:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), Deuterium (D).\n    *   **Atomic Masses (approximate integer mass numbers):**\n        *   D ≈ 2 u\n        *   Li ≈ 7 u\n        *   Al ≈ 27 u\n    *   **Lightest Element:** Deuterium (D), with a mass of ~2 u.\n    *   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminum (Al), with a mass of ~27 u.\n    *   **Interpret the instruction:** \"Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all... must be summed.\"\n        *   This means I need to find the total mass contribution from all atoms of the lightest element and add it to the total mass contribution from all atoms of the heaviest element.\n    *   **Calculation:**\n        *   Total mass of the lightest element (Deuterium): There are 4 'D' atoms. So, 4 × 2 u = 8 u.\n        *   Total mass of the heaviest element (Aluminum): There is 1 'Al' atom. So, 1 × 27 u = 27 u.\n        *   Sum = 8 u + 27 u = 35 u.\n\n6.  **Final Check with Code:** I can use a Python script to perform the calculation with more precise atomic masses to confirm the result.\n\n```python\n# Atomic mass of Deuterium (D, the lightest element in the compound)\nmass_D = 2.0141\n\n# Atomic mass of Aluminum (Al, the heaviest element in the compound)\nmass_Al = 26.9815\n\n# Substance X is LiAlD4. It contains 4 atoms of Deuterium and 1 atom of Aluminum.\n# The question asks for the sum of the cumulative masses of the lightest and heaviest elements.\ncumulative_mass = (4 * mass_D) + (1 * mass_Al)\n\n# Print the result, rounded to the nearest integer as per the options.\nprint(int(round(cumulative_mass)))\n```\n<execute_code>\n35\n</execute_code>\n\nThe code confirms that the calculated value is 35.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Clue 6: Melting Point of B**\n    The melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K.\n    *   Kelvin to Celsius conversion: K - 273.15 = °C\n    *   277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier isotope of hydrogen, Deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    *   This is a very strong match. Therefore, substance **B is D₂O (heavy water)**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Clue 1 & 3: Isotope and Gas W**\n    *   Clue 1 states substance X contains a heavier isotope. Since B is D₂O, this isotope is very likely Deuterium (D, or ²H).\n    *   Clue 3 states that gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's test D₂ gas. A Deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule therefore has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits the description perfectly.\n    *   Therefore, gas **W is D₂ (dideuterium gas)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Clue 7 & 8: Identifying Substance X**\n    *   Clue 8 states X and its analog are common reagents in organic chemistry.\n    *   Clue 7 states that X reacts with a keto acid to produce a product with 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid (R-CO-R'-COOH) has 3 oxygen atoms. A reduction of both the ketone and carboxylic acid groups would yield a diol (R-CH(OH)-R'-CH₂OH), which has 2 oxygen atoms. This means **X is a powerful reducing agent**.\n    *   The most common powerful hydride reducing agents in organic chemistry are Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄) and Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄). Since X contains Deuterium, it must be an analog like LiAlD₄ or NaBD₄.\n    *   LiAlH₄ is powerful enough to reduce both ketones and carboxylic acids, while NaBH₄ is generally not strong enough to reduce carboxylic acids. This strongly suggests that X is **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)** and its analog is LiAlH₄.\n\n4.  **Verify the Reaction with all Clues**\n    *   Let's test the reaction of X (LiAlD₄) with Y. Since the products are D₂ and D₂O, the reactant liquid Y is most likely D₂O.\n    *   The reaction is: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)`\n    *   **Clue 2 (Violent reaction):** Yes, the reaction of LiAlH₄ with water is extremely violent, and the same is true for its deuterated analog.\n    *   **Clue 4 (Precipitate G):** Yes, Aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, is an insoluble solid and would form a precipitate.\n    *   **Clue 5 (Heating G releases B):** Yes, heating the precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) would cause it to decompose and release B (D₂O): `2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`.\n    *   All clues are consistent with **X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n5.  **Perform the Final Calculation**\n    *   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n    *   **Constituent Elements:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), Deuterium (D).\n    *   **Identify the lightest and heaviest elements by atomic mass:**\n        *   Deuterium (D): ~2 u\n        *   Lithium (Li): ~7 u\n        *   Aluminum (Al): ~27 u\n        *   The lightest element is **Deuterium (D)**.\n        *   The heaviest element is **Aluminum (Al)**.\n    *   **Calculate the cumulative masses as instructed:**\n        *   There are **4** atoms of the lightest element (D). Total mass = 4 × (mass of D) ≈ 4 × 2 = 8 u.\n        *   There is **1** atom of the heaviest element (Al). Total mass = 1 × (mass of Al) ≈ 1 × 27 = 27 u.\n    *   **Sum the cumulative masses:** 8 u + 27 u = **35** u.\n\nTo confirm the calculation with more precise values:\n```python\n# Atomic mass of Deuterium (D, the lightest element) is approximately 2.014 u.\n# Atomic mass of Aluminum (Al, the heaviest element) is approximately 26.982 u.\n# Substance X is LiAlD4.\n# It contains 4 atoms of Deuterium and 1 atom of Aluminum.\n\n# The question asks for the sum of the cumulative masses of the lightest and heaviest elements.\ncumulative_mass = (4 * 2.014) + (1 * 26.982)\n\n# The result is 8.056 + 26.982 = 35.038, which rounds to 35.\nprint(int(round(cumulative_mass)))\n```\n<<<A>>>",
