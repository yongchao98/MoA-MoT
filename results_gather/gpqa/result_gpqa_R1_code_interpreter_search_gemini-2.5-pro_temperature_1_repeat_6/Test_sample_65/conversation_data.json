    "The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is an extension of the Standard Model (SM) that includes higher-dimensional operators. It is constructed as a quantum field theory (QFT) that respects the fundamental principles of modern physics, while allowing for new phenomena beyond the SM. Let's analyze each symmetry:\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry**: This is a fundamental symmetry of spacetime in special relativity. All relativistic quantum field theories, including the Standard Model and its effective field theory extensions like SMEFT, are built on the principle of Lorentz invariance. The operators in the SMEFT Lagrangian are constructed to be Lorentz scalars. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry must be respected.\n\n2.  **Poincare Symmetry**: This is a broader spacetime symmetry that includes Lorentz transformations (boosts and rotations) and spacetime translations. Invariance under translations leads to the conservation of energy and momentum. Like Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry is a foundational assumption for constructing the SMEFT Lagrangian. Therefore, Poincare symmetry must be respected.\n\n3.  **CP Symmetry**: This is the combined symmetry of charge conjugation (C) and parity inversion (P). It is well-established that the Standard Model itself violates CP symmetry, most notably in the weak interactions (as described by the CKM matrix). Since SMEFT is an extension of the SM, it is not required to respect CP symmetry. In fact, SMEFT introduces new higher-dimensional operators that can be additional sources of CP violation. Therefore, CP symmetry is *not* a required symmetry for all operators in SMEFT.\n\n4.  **CPT Symmetry**: This is the combined symmetry of charge conjugation (C), parity inversion (P), and time reversal (T). The CPT theorem is a cornerstone of quantum field theory. It states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be invariant under the CPT transformation. Since the standard formulation of SMEFT is a local and Lorentz-invariant QFT, it must respect CPT symmetry.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the standard SMEFT framework are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincare symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4).\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
