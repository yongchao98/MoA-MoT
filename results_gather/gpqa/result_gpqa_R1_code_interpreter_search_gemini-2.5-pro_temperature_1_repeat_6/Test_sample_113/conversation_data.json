    "**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Reaction:** `butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile`\n    *   **Type of Reaction:** This is a classic cyanohydrin formation. The reaction involves the nucleophilic addition of a cyanide ion (CN⁻) to the carbonyl carbon of a ketone (butan-2-one).\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  The nucleophile, cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN, attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This breaks the C=O pi bond and forms an alkoxide intermediate.\n        2.  The negatively charged oxygen atom of the alkoxide intermediate is then protonated by a proton source to form the final hydroxyl group (-OH) of the cyanohydrin product.\n    *   **Role of Reagent A:** Reagent A must be the proton source required for the second step of the mechanism. Looking at the options for A:\n        *   `NaHSO₃` (Sodium bisulfite): This reagent is used to form bisulfite addition products, which is a different reaction. It is not a proton source in the context of cyanohydrin formation.\n        *   `H₃O⁺` (Hydronium ion): This represents an acidic aqueous solution (e.g., dilute HCl or H₂SO₄). An acid is the perfect source of protons to protonate the alkoxide intermediate. While the reaction needs free CN⁻ and is often run under slightly acidic or buffered conditions (pH 4-5) to avoid protonating all the cyanide to HCN (a weaker nucleophile), an acid source (represented by H₃O⁺) is essential for the final protonation step.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** Reagent A must be `H₃O⁺`. This eliminates options A and D. We are left with options B and C.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Reaction:** `2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid`\n    *   **Type of Reaction:** This reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   **Mechanism:** The hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids can be catalyzed by either strong acid or strong base, typically with heating.\n        *   **Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis:** The nitrile is treated with a strong aqueous acid (like HCl or H₂SO₄, often represented as H₃O⁺) and heated. The reaction proceeds through an amide intermediate, which is then further hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid and an ammonium ion.\n        *   **Base-catalyzed hydrolysis:** The nitrile is treated with a strong aqueous base (like NaOH) and heated. This forms a carboxylate salt, which must then be treated with acid in a separate workup step to yield the final carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Role of Reagent B:** Reagent B, used with water (H₂O), acts as the catalyst for the hydrolysis. Let's examine the options for B from the remaining choices (B and C):\n        *   `HCl` (Hydrochloric acid): This is a strong mineral acid. It is a standard and effective reagent for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of nitriles.\n        *   `CH₃COOH` (Acetic acid): This is a weak organic acid. While it is an acid, it is generally not strong enough to effectively catalyze the complete hydrolysis of a stable nitrile to a carboxylic acid in a reasonable timeframe. The reaction requires harsh conditions, i.e., a strong acid or base.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** Reagent B must be a strong acid, `HCl`.\n\n3.  **Final Selection:**\n    *   We determined that A = `H₃O⁺`.\n    *   We determined that B = `HCl`.\n    *   This combination matches option B.\n\n    *   **Option B:** A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl. This is a consistent and chemically correct choice for both reactions.\n    *   **Option C:** A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH. The choice of `CH₃COOH` for the second reaction is incorrect as it's too weak for effective nitrile hydrolysis.\n\nTherefore, the correct set of reagents is given in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
