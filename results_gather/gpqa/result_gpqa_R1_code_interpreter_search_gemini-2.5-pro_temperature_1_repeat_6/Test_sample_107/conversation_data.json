    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem.\n\n### **1. Understand the Physical Quantities**\n\nWe need to compare two energy values:\n*   **The paramagnetic coupling term `⟨H⟩`**: This is the energy shift of an atomic state due to an external magnetic field. This phenomenon is known as the Zeeman effect.\n*   **The transition energy `ΔE`**: This is the energy difference between two atomic levels, which corresponds to the energy of a photon emitted or absorbed during the transition.\n\n### **2. Calculate the Transition Energy `ΔE`**\n\nThe energy of a photon (`ΔE`) is related to its wavelength (`λ`) by the Planck-Einstein relation:\n$ΔE = \\frac{hc}{λ}$\n\nWhere:\n*   `h` is the Planck constant ($6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J·s}$)\n*   `c` is the speed of light ($3.00 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}$)\n*   `λ` is the given wavelength ($0.4861 \\mu\\text{m} = 0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$)\n\nLet's calculate this value.\n\n$ΔE = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J·s}) \\times (3.00 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s})}{0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}} \\approx 4.089 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}$\n\nIt is often more convenient to work with electron-volts (eV) in atomic physics. Using the conversion factor $1 \\text{ eV} = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}$:\n\n$ΔE = \\frac{4.089 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}}{1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J/eV}} \\approx 2.55 \\text{ eV}$\n\n*(Note: The wavelength $\\lambda=0.4861\\mu m$ corresponds to the H-beta line in the Balmer series of the hydrogen atom, which is the transition from the n=4 to the n=2 energy level. The energy difference is indeed $E_4 - E_2 = (-13.6/4^2) - (-13.6/2^2) = -0.85 - (-3.4) = 2.55 \\text{ eV}$, confirming our calculation.)*\n\n### **3. Calculate the Paramagnetic Coupling Term `⟨H⟩`**\n\nThe energy shift due to the paramagnetic coupling (the linear Zeeman effect) is given by the expectation value of the interaction Hamiltonian, `H_Z`:\n$⟨H⟩ = ⟨H_Z⟩ = m \\cdot \\mu_B \\cdot B$\n\nWhere:\n*   `m` is the orbital magnetic quantum number. The problem states it has \"small values\", so we can take a typical non-zero value like `m=1`.\n*   `μ_B` is the Bohr magneton, a fundamental physical constant with a value of $9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J/T}$.\n*   `B` is the magnitude of the external magnetic field, given as `1 T`.\n\nLet's calculate this value for `m=1`.\n\n$⟨H⟩ = (1) \\times (9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J/T}) \\times (1 \\text{ T}) = 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J}$\n\nNow, let's convert this to electron-volts (eV) for a direct comparison with `ΔE`.\n\n$⟨H⟩ = \\frac{9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J}}{1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J/eV}} \\approx 5.79 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV}$\n\n### **4. Compare the Orders of Magnitude**\n\nNow we compare the two calculated energies:\n*   `ΔE ≈ 2.55 eV`\n*   `⟨H⟩ ≈ 5.79 × 10⁻⁵ eV`\n\nLet's find the ratio of these two values:\n$\\frac{⟨H⟩}{ΔE} = \\frac{5.79 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV}}{2.55 \\text{ eV}} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5}$\n\nThis ratio is extremely small, on the order of $10^{-5}$. This means that the energy of the paramagnetic coupling is about 100,000 times smaller than the transition energy.\n\nTherefore, the relationship between the two quantities is:\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll\\Delta E$\n\nThe paramagnetic coupling term is significantly smaller than the electronic transition energy.\n\n<<<A>>>"
