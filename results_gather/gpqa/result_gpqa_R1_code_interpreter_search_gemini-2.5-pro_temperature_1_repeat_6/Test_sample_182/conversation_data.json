    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Analyze the Reactant**\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down its structure to understand its components and calculate its initial index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD). The IHD (also known as the degree of unsaturation) represents the number of rings and pi (Ï€) bonds in a molecule.\n\n*   **Cyclohex-3-ene**: This is a six-membered carbon ring containing one carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n    *   The ring itself contributes 1 to the IHD.\n    *   The C=C double bond within the ring contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **Carboxylic acid**: This is a -COOH group. It contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n    *   The C=O double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **Formyl group**: This is a -CHO group (an aldehyde). It also contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n    *   The C=O double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **Vinyl group**: This is a -CH=CH2 group. It contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n    *   The C=C double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n\n**Calculating the IHD of the reactant:**\nBy summing the contributions from each part of the structure:\nIHD (reactant) = 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C in ring) + 1 (C=O in acid) + 1 (C=O in formyl) + 1 (C=C in vinyl) = 5.\n\nSo, the index of hydrogen deficiency of the starting material is 5.\n\n### **2. Understand the Reaction**\n\nThe reagent used is **red phosphorus (Red P) and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI)**. This combination is a very powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. Its key function is to perform a complete reduction of a wide range of functional groups to the corresponding alkane. Specifically:\n\n*   It reduces aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) to methyl groups (-CH3).\n*   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to carbon-carbon single bonds (C-C).\n*   Essentially, it removes all pi bonds and most heteroatoms (like oxygen), converting the molecule into a saturated hydrocarbon.\n*   Importantly, this reaction does not break stable ring structures.\n\n### **3. Determine the Structure and IHD of the Product**\n\nThe reaction will act on all the functional groups and double bonds present in the reactant:\n\n1.  The **C=C double bond** in the cyclohexene ring will be reduced to a C-C single bond. This removes 1 unit of IHD.\n2.  The **C=O double bond** in the carboxylic acid group will be reduced. This removes 1 unit of IHD.\n3.  The **C=O double bond** in the formyl group will be reduced. This removes 1 unit of IHD.\n4.  The **C=C double bond** in the vinyl group will be reduced to a C-C single bond. This removes 1 unit of IHD.\n\nThe **ring structure** itself will remain intact.\n\n**Calculating the IHD of the product:**\nThe original IHD was 5. The reaction removes the four pi bonds, so it reduces the IHD by 4.\n\nIHD (product) = IHD (reactant) - IHD (removed by reaction)\nIHD (product) = 5 - 4 = 1\n\nThe resulting molecule is a saturated cycloalkane (specifically, a substituted cyclohexane). A saturated monocyclic compound always has an IHD of 1, which corresponds to the presence of the single ring.\n\n### **4. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe reaction reduces all double bonds (both C=C and C=O) in the starting material but leaves the ring structure intact. The four pi bonds are eliminated, reducing the IHD from 5 to 1. The remaining IHD of 1 is due to the cyclohexane ring in the product.\n\nTherefore, the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\nThe correct option is B.\n<<<B>>>"
