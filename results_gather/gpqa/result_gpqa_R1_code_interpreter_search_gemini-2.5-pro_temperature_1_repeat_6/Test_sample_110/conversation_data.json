    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the given reactions.\n\n### **Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is a Michael addition reaction. Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, sterically hindered base that will deprotonate the ketone at the α-carbon to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate).\n\n2.  **Formation of the enolate:**\n    *   The starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   We need to identify the acidic α-protons (protons on the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n    *   The α-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group, so it is a quaternary carbon and has no α-protons.\n    *   C6 is substituted with a methyl group and a hydrogen atom. It has one acidic α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, the base t-BuOK can only abstract the proton from C6. This forms a single enolate where the negative charge (and nucleophilicity) is localized at C6.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition:**\n    *   The enolate formed from the cyclohexanone attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt).\n    *   The nucleophile is the C6 of the cyclohexanone ring.\n    *   The attack forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C6 of the ring and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The initial adduct is an enolate of the ester, which is then protonated during the work-up step (implicitly assumed) to give the final product.\n    *   The reaction is:\n        (enolate at C6) + CH₂=CH-COOEt → (Ring)-C6-CH₂-CH⁻-COOEt\n        (Ring)-C6-CH₂-CH⁻-COOEt + H⁺ (workup) → (Ring)-C6-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product A:**\n    *   The resulting molecule has the original substituted cyclohexanone ring, with a new `-(CH₂)₂COOEt` (ethyl propanoate) group attached at C6.\n    *   The substituents on the ring are: a carbonyl at C1, an ethyl and a methyl at C2, and a methyl and the new chain at C6.\n    *   The options provide names where the ethyl propanoate is the parent chain and the cyclohexanone ring is a substituent. Let's analyze the names based on this convention.\n    *   The substituent is attached to C3 of the propanoate chain, so the name is `ethyl 3-(...cyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n    *   The numbering of the cyclohexyl substituent ring starts from the point of attachment (our C6). Let's call this C1'.\n    *   Following the ring atoms from C1' (our C6) towards the carbonyl group (our C1):\n        *   C1' (our C6) has a methyl group.\n        *   C2' (our C1) has the oxo (=O) group.\n        *   C3' (our C2) has an ethyl group and a methyl group.\n    *   So, the substituent name should be `3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl`.\n    *   This matches the name for product A in options B and D: `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n    *   The name in options A and C, `...-4-oxocyclohexyl`, implies the ketone is at C4' of the substituent ring, which is incorrect as the ketone is adjacent (at C2') to the point of attachment (C1').\n\n### **Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile (KOH, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is another Michael addition. KOH is a strong base that deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane. The resulting nitronate anion is a strong nucleophile. It attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as trans-crotononitrile).\n\n2.  **Formation of the nucleophile:**\n    *   1-nitropropane is CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂. The α-carbon (C1) has two acidic protons.\n    *   KOH abstracts one of these protons to form the nitronate anion, which has a resonance structure with a carbanion at the α-carbon: CH₃CH₂CH⁻-NO₂.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition:**\n    *   The nucleophilic carbanion from 1-nitropropane attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n    *   The β-carbon is the one bearing the methyl group.\n    *   The new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of nitropropane and the β-carbon of the nitrile.\n    *   Attack: (CH₃CH₂CH⁻-NO₂) + (CH₃-CH=CH-CN) → CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH⁻-CN\n    *   The resulting carbanion is protonated by water (H₂O) to yield the final product.\n    *   Product: CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product B:**\n    *   We need to find the IUPAC name for CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN.\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so the suffix is `-nitrile`.\n    *   The longest carbon chain including the nitrile carbon has 6 carbons. So, the parent alkane is hexane, and the parent name is `hexanenitrile`.\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n        *   CN is C1\n        *   -CH₂- is C2\n        *   -CH(CH₃)- is C3\n        *   -CH(NO₂)- is C4\n        *   -CH₂- is C5\n        *   -CH₃ is C6\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   Listing them alphabetically, the name is: `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`.\n    *   This matches the name for product B in options A and B.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A:** `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`\n*   **Product B:** `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`\n\nCombining these results, the correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
