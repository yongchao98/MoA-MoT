    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct conclusion from the experimental data.\n\n1.  **Analyze the role of Gene G2.**\n    *   The single mutant `g2` shows a complete loss of resistance (0% resistance). This is the most severe phenotype observed.\n    *   The double mutant `g1g2` also shows 0% resistance. The phenotype of the double mutant is identical to the phenotype of the `g2` single mutant. This is the definition of epistasis, where the mutation in G2 masks the effect of the mutation in G1. Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G1**.\n    *   Similarly, the double mutant `g2g3` shows 0% resistance, which is identical to the `g2` single mutant phenotype. This means **G2 is also epistatic to G3**.\n    *   The problem states that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream. A gene that is epistatic to other genes in a pathway and whose knockout results in a complete loss of the final product (in this case, resistance) is the most likely candidate for an upstream master regulator, such as a transcription factor. If G2 is a TF that activates G1 and G3, knocking out G2 would prevent both G1 and G3 from functioning, leading to a complete loss of resistance. This model fits the data perfectly.\n    *   **Conclusion 1: G2 is a transcription factor.** This eliminates option D, which suggests G1 is the transcription factor.\n\n2.  **Analyze the interaction between Gene G1 and Gene G3.**\n    *   The single mutant `g1` has 75% resistance (a 25% loss from the control).\n    *   The single mutant `g3` has 50% resistance (a 50% loss from the control).\n    *   The double mutant `g1g3` has 10% resistance (a 90% loss from the control).\n    *   If the effects were simply additive, the expected loss of resistance in the double mutant would be the sum of the individual losses: 25% + 50% = 75% loss, resulting in 25% resistance.\n    *   However, the observed loss is 90%, which is significantly greater than the additive expectation. This phenomenon is known as a **synergistic interaction**.\n    *   A synergistic interaction suggests that the two genes contribute to the same outcome through parallel pathways or have partially overlapping functions. This concept is best described as **gene redundancy** (in this case, partial redundancy, since single mutants do have a phenotype). Both G1 and G3 are important for resistance, and losing both is much more detrimental than losing just one.\n    *   **Conclusion 2: G1 and G3 show gene redundancy.**\n\n3.  **Evaluate the remaining options based on the conclusions.**\n    *   We are looking for an option that states G2 is a transcription factor and that G1 and G3 show gene redundancy.\n    *   **Option A:** `G2 is a transcription factor` (Correct), `G1 and G3 has the same promoter` (Not supported by the data, as we have distinct single mutants), `G3 is epistatic towards G1` (Incorrect, the `g1g3` phenotype of 10% is not the same as the `g3` phenotype of 50%).\n    *   **Option B:** `G2 is a transcription factor` (Correct), `G1 and G3 show pleiotropy` (Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits; we only measured one trait, so this cannot be concluded), `G1 is epistatic towards G3` (Incorrect, the `g1g3` phenotype of 10% is not the same as the `g1` phenotype of 75%).\n    *   **Option C:** `G2 is a transcription factor` (Correct), `G1 and G3 show gene redundancy` (Correct, this is the best description for their synergistic interaction), `G1 is epistatic towards G3` (Incorrect, as established above).\n\n4.  **Select the best option.**\n    *   Option C contains two correct and strongly supported conclusions derived directly from the data: G2 is a transcription factor, and G1/G3 show gene redundancy. The third clause about epistasis between G1 and G3 is incorrect.\n    *   However, compared to the other options, Option C provides the most accurate overall description of the genetic network. Options A and B use incorrect or unsupported terms to describe the G1/G3 interaction (\"same promoter\", \"pleiotropy\"). Option D incorrectly identifies the transcription factor.\n    *   Therefore, despite the error in its third clause (which is likely a mistake in the question's construction), Option C is the best and most comprehensive conclusion that can be drawn from the experiment.\n\n<<<C>>>"
