    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   We are given the relationship between the number of stars and parallax. Specifically, the number of stars *per unit range of parallax* varies as 1/plx⁵. Let's write this mathematically. Let N be the number of stars and plx be the parallax. The number of stars per unit range of parallax is represented by the derivative dN/d(plx).\n    *   So, the given information is: dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵.\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    *   We need to find how the number of stars *per unit range of distance* (r) changes with distance. This is represented by the derivative dN/dr.\n    *   Our goal is to find the proportionality of dN/dr with respect to r.\n\n3.  **Find the Key Relationship:**\n    *   The crucial link between the given information and the goal is the relationship between distance (r) and parallax (plx).\n    *   By definition, parallax is inversely proportional to distance: plx = 1/r.\n\n4.  **Use Calculus to Transform the Variables:**\n    *   We have a function in terms of `plx` (dN/d(plx)) and we want to express it in terms of `r` (dN/dr). The chain rule of differentiation is the perfect tool for this.\n    *   The chain rule states: dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr).\n\n5.  **Calculate the Necessary Components:**\n    *   **First part (given):** We already know dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵.\n    *   **Second part (derivative):** We need to find the derivative of plx with respect to r.\n        *   plx = 1/r = r⁻¹\n        *   d(plx)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²\n\n6.  **Substitute and Simplify:**\n    *   Now, substitute the two parts back into the chain rule equation:\n        dN/dr ∝ (plx⁻⁵) * (-1/r²)\n    *   The expression is still in terms of both `plx` and `r`. We need to express everything in terms of `r` to find the final relationship.\n    *   Substitute plx = 1/r into the expression:\n        dN/dr ∝ ( (1/r)⁻⁵ ) * (-1/r²)\n    *   Simplify the exponents:\n        *   (1/r)⁻⁵ = (r⁻¹)⁻⁵ = r⁵\n    *   Now the proportionality becomes:\n        dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (-1/r²)\n        dN/dr ∝ -r⁵ / r²\n        dN/dr ∝ -r³\n    *   The negative sign indicates that as parallax decreases, the number of stars per unit distance increases. The question asks for the relationship of the *magnitude*, which is how it \"changes\". Therefore, we are interested in the power of r.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The number of stars per unit range of distance, dN/dr, is proportional to r³.\n\n8.  **Match with Options:**\n    *   A) ~ r³\n    *   B) ~ r⁴\n    *   C) ~ r²\n    *   D) ~ r⁵\n    *   Our result, r³, matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
