The star has a mass of 1.5 times that of the Sun, a radius 1.2 times that of the Sun, and an effective temperature (Teff) of 6300 K. Planet1 has a mass equivalent to 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 times that of Earth, while Planet2 has a mass equivalent to 5 Earth masses and a radius 1.3 times that of Earth. Interestingly, both planets are in circular orbits. Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 Å in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å, while the gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift of up to 0.04 Å.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The primary objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Equilibrium Temperature:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n    T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a)) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n    where:\n    *   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   R_star is the star's radius.\n    *   'a' is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n    *   'A' is the planet's albedo.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures:** We need to find T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n    T_eq1 = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1)) * (1 - A_1)^(1/4)\n    T_eq2 = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2)) * (1 - A_2)^(1/4)\n\n    Since both planets orbit the same star, T_star and R_star are the same. The problem states that both planets have the same albedo (A_1 = A_2). Therefore, these terms will cancel out when we take the ratio:\n\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1))] / [sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))]\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n\n    This shows that the temperature ratio depends only on the ratio of the semi-major axes of the planets' orbits.\n\n4.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data:** The problem provides information from the radial velocity (RV) method, specifically the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ_max). We need to connect this to the semi-major axis 'a'.\n\n    First, the maximum Doppler shift is used to find the star's maximum radial velocity (the RV semi-amplitude, K):\n    K = (Δλ_max / λ_0) * c\n    where c is the speed of light and λ_0 is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:\n    K = (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a) * sin(i)\n    where:\n    *   M_p is the planet's mass.\n    *   M_star is the star's mass.\n    *   G is the gravitational constant.\n    *   'i' is the orbital inclination.\n\n    The problem states the planets were also detected by the transit method. This implies the orbits are viewed nearly edge-on, so the inclination `i` is approximately 90°, and `sin(i)` is approximately 1.\n\n5.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis 'a':**\n    Rearranging the formula for K (with sin(i) = 1):\n    K = (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n    K^2 = (M_p / M_star)^2 * (G * M_star / a)\n    K^2 = (M_p^2 * G) / (M_star * a)\n    a = (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * K^2)\n\n6.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes (a_2 / a_1):**\n    a_1 = (G * M_p1^2) / (M_star * K_1^2)\n    a_2 = (G * M_p2^2) / (M_star * K_2^2)\n\n    Now, we find the ratio a_2 / a_1. The constants G and M_star will cancel out:\n    a_2 / a_1 = [(G * M_p2^2) / (M_star * K_2^2)] / [(G * M_p1^2) / (M_star * K_1^2)]\n    a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2^2 / K_2^2) * (K_1^2 / M_p1^2)\n    a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_1 / K_2)^2\n\n7.  **Calculate the necessary ratios:**\n    *   **Mass Ratio (M_p2 / M_p1):**\n        M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n        M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n        M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n\n    *   **RV Semi-Amplitude Ratio (K_1 / K_2):**\n        K is directly proportional to Δλ_max.\n        K_1 ∝ Δλ_1 = 0.03 Å\n        K_2 ∝ Δλ_2 = 0.04 Å\n        K_1 / K_2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n8.  **Substitute the ratios to find a_2 / a_1:**\n    a_2 / a_1 = (5 / 7)^2 * (3 / 4)^2\n    a_2 / a_1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\n    a_2 / a_1 = 225 / 784\n\n9.  **Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:**\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\n10. **Compute the numerical value.**\n    I will use a short Python script for the final calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given ratios from the problem\n# Ratio of planet masses (Mp2 / Mp1)\nM_p2_over_M_p1 = 5 / 7\n\n# Ratio of RV semi-amplitudes (K1 / K2), which is proportional to the Doppler shifts\nK_1_over_K_2 = 0.03 / 0.04\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes (a2 / a1)\n# a2/a1 = (Mp2/Mp1)^2 * (K1/K2)^2\na2_over_a1 = (M_p2_over_M_p1)**2 * (K_1_over_K_2)**2\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures (Teq1 / Teq2)\n# Teq1/Teq2 = sqrt(a2/a1)\nTeq1_over_Teq2 = math.sqrt(a2_over_a1)\n\nprint(Teq1_over_Teq2)\n```",
    "The calculation shows that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 0.5357.\n\nLet's compare this result with the given options:\nA) ~ 1.05\nB) ~ 0.98\nC) ~ 1.30\nD) ~ 0.53\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.5357 is closest to option D.\n\nFinal verification of the steps:\n- The formula for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1) is correct for planets around the same star with the same albedo.\n- The formula relating the semi-major axis 'a' to the RV semi-amplitude 'K' and planet mass 'M_p' is a = (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * K^2) for circular orbits viewed edge-on (sin(i)=1).\n- The ratio of semi-major axes a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_1 / K_2)^2 is derived correctly.\n- The RV semi-amplitude K is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift Δλ (K = c * Δλ / λ_0), so the ratio K_1 / K_2 is equal to the ratio Δλ_1 / Δλ_2.\n- The values used for the ratios are correct: M_p2 / M_p1 = 5/7 and K_1 / K_2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4.\n- The final calculation T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt((5/7)^2 * (3/4)^2) = sqrt(225/784) = 15/28 ≈ 0.5357 is arithmetically sound.\n\nThe reasoning and calculation are correct.
