    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, which is also characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the candidates.\n\n### **2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds in the molecule. All four candidate structures are saturated, which is consistent with this observation.\n*   **Key Splitting Patterns:** The most crucial information comes from the complex splitting patterns (multiplicity) of two different signals:\n    *   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    *   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n\nTo understand these patterns, we use the n+1 rule. A signal is split into n+1 lines by 'n' equivalent neighboring protons. When a proton is coupled to multiple, non-equivalent sets of protons, the multiplicities multiply.\n\n*   A **dtq** means a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighbors:\n    *   One proton (1+1 = 2, a **d**oublet)\n    *   Two equivalent protons (2+1 = 3, a **t**riplet)\n    *   Three equivalent protons (3+1 = 4, a **q**uartet)\n*   A **dtt** means a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighbors:\n    *   One proton (1+1 = 2, a **d**oublet)\n    *   Two equivalent protons (2+1 = 3, a **t**riplet)\n    *   Another set of two equivalent protons (2+1 = 3, another **t**riplet)\n\nNow, we must analyze the structure of each candidate to see which one would produce both of these signals from two different protons in the molecule.\n\n### **3. Structural Analysis of Candidates**\n\nThe condensed formulas can be ambiguous. Let's interpret them into standard structural drawings and analyze the protons, focusing on the methine (CH) protons on the main carbon chain, as these are most likely to show such complex splitting.\n\n*   **Candidate A: `CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH` -> 3,4-Dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    *   ` (CH3)2CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH `\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to a CH (1H), a CH₂ (2H), and a CH₃ (3H). This would give a **dtq**.\n    *   However, there is no proton in this molecule coupled to a CH and two different CH₂ groups. Therefore, it cannot produce a **dtt**.\n\n*   **Candidate C: `CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH` -> 2,3-Dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    *   ` CH3CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH `\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to a CH (1H, at C2), a CH₂ (2H, from the ethyl group), and a CH₃ (3H, the methyl at C3). This gives a **dtq**.\n    *   Again, there is no proton coupled to a CH and two different CH₂ groups, so it cannot produce a **dtt**.\n\n*   **Candidate D: `CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH` -> 2,3-Diethylpentanoic acid**\n    *   ` CH3CH2-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-COOH `\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to a CH (1H, at C2), a CH₂ (2H, from the main chain ethyl group), and another CH₂ (2H, from the ethyl substituent at C3). This gives a **dtt**.\n    *   However, there is no proton in this molecule coupled to a CH, a CH₂, and a CH₃. Therefore, it cannot produce a **dtq**.\n\n*   **Candidate B: `CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH`**\n    This formula is ambiguously written. The most plausible chemical structure that can be formed from these atoms and result in the given NMR signals is **3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**.\n    Let's draw this structure and analyze its protons:\n    ```\n                    CH₃ (at C4)\n                    |\n      CH₃-CH₂---CH---CH---CH₂---COOH\n                         |\n                         CH₂-CH₃ (at C3)\n    ```\n    Let's analyze the two key methine (CH) protons:\n    1.  **Proton at C4 (H-C4):** This proton is coupled to:\n        *   The proton at C3 (1H) -> **doublet**\n        *   The CH₂ group at C5 (2H) -> **triplet**\n        *   The CH₃ group attached at C4 (3H) -> **quartet**\n        *   The resulting signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first required signal.\n    2.  **Proton at C3 (H-C3):** This proton is coupled to:\n        *   The proton at C4 (1H) -> **doublet**\n        *   The CH₂ group at C2 (2H) -> **triplet**\n        *   The CH₂ group of the ethyl substituent at C3 (2H) -> **triplet**\n        *   The resulting signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second required signal.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nOnly the structure corresponding to **3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid (Option B)** can produce both a `dtq` signal and a `dtt` signal in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>"
