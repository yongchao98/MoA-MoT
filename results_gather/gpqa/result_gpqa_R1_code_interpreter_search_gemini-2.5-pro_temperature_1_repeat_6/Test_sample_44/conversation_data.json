    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the System:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Spin-1/2 particles are fermions, which means they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. They are confined to a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L.\n\n2.  **Single-Particle Energy Levels:** The energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well are given by the formula:\n    E_n = (n^2 * pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2 * m * L^2)\n    where *n* is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...), *m* is the mass of the particle, and *L* is the length of the well.\n\n3.  **Use the Given Energy Unit:** The problem defines a base energy unit E as:\n    E = (pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2 * m * L^2)\n    So, we can express the single-particle energy levels simply as:\n    *   E_1 (n=1) = 1^2 * E = 1E\n    *   E_2 (n=2) = 2^2 * E = 4E\n    *   E_3 (n=3) = 3^2 * E = 9E\n    *   E_4 (n=4) = 4^2 * E = 16E\n    *   and so on.\n\n4.  **Apply the Pauli Exclusion Principle:** The Pauli Exclusion Principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. A quantum state here is defined by the energy level *n* and the spin projection *m_s* (which can be spin up, +1/2, or spin down, -1/2). This means that each energy level *n* can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_ground):**\n    To find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles, following the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n    *   The first two particles go into the n=1 level (one spin up, one spin down). The energy for these two particles is 2 * E_1 = 2 * 1E = 2E.\n    *   The next two particles go into the n=2 level (one spin up, one spin down). The energy for these two particles is 2 * E_2 = 2 * 4E = 8E.\n    *   The total ground state energy is the sum: E_ground = 2E + 8E = 10E.\n\n6.  **Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_1st_excited):**\n    The first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. We achieve this by promoting one particle from the highest occupied level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied level (n=3).\n    *   The new configuration is: two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n    *   The total energy for this state is: E_1st_excited = (2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_3) = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd_excited):**\n    The second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We need to consider the possible excitations from the ground state that have higher energy than the first excited state.\n    *   **Possibility A:** Excite one particle from n=1 to n=3. The configuration becomes: one particle in n=1, two particles in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n        *   Energy = (1 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) + (1 * E_3) = (1 * 1E) + (2 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n    *   **Possibility B:** Promote the second particle from n=2 to n=3. The configuration becomes: two particles in n=1 and two particles in n=3.\n        *   Energy = (2 * E_1) + (2 * E_3) = (2 * 1E) + (2 * 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n    *   **Possibility C:** Excite one particle from n=2 to n=4. The configuration becomes: two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=4.\n        *   Energy = (2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_4) = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n\n    Comparing the energies of these possibilities (18E, 20E, 22E), the lowest one is 18E. Therefore, the second excited state energy is 18E.\n\n8.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Ground state energy = 10E\n    *   First excited state energy = 15E\n    *   Second excited state energy = 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
