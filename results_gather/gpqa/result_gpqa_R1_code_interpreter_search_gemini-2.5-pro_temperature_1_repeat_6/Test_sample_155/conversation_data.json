    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. The molecule is symmetrical, with a propyl group on each side of the double bond (CH₃CH₂CH₂-CH=CH-CH₂CH₂CH₃). It is achiral.\n\n2.  **Reagent 1: mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid).** This reagent performs an epoxidation reaction. The epoxidation is a *syn-addition*, meaning the oxygen atom adds to both carbons of the double bond from the same face.\n\n3.  **Stereochemistry of Epoxidation:** When a symmetrical *trans*-alkene undergoes epoxidation, it forms a *trans*-epoxide. Since the attack can occur from either the top face or the bottom face of the alkene with equal probability, a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides is formed.\n    -   (E)-oct-4-ene → (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane + (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    -   These two products are enantiomers and are formed in a 1:1 ratio (a racemic mixture).\n\n4.  **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This reagent is used for the ring-opening of the epoxide. The mechanism involves protonation of the epoxide oxygen, followed by a backside (anti) attack by a water molecule (nucleophile) on one of the epoxide carbons. This overall process results in *anti-dihydroxylation* of the original alkene.\n\n5.  **Stereochemistry of Ring Opening:** We need to consider the ring opening for both enantiomers of the epoxide.\n    -   **For (4R,5R)-epoxide:** Water can attack C4 or C5.\n        -   Attack at C4: Inverts the configuration at C4 from R to S. The configuration at C5 remains R. Product: (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        -   Attack at C5: Inverts the configuration at C5 from R to S. The configuration at C4 remains R. Product: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        Note that (4S,5R)- and (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol are the same compound. This compound has a plane of symmetry (or a center of inversion) and is a *meso* compound.\n    -   **For (4S,5S)-epoxide:**\n        -   Attack at C4: Inverts C4 from S to R. C5 remains S. Product: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (the same meso compound).\n        -   Attack at C5: Inverts C5 from S to R. C4 remains S. Product: (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (the same meso compound).\n\n6.  **Product of Reaction 1:** The only product from Reaction 1 is the single meso compound: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. It is also symmetrical and achiral.\n\n2.  **Reagent 1: mCPBA.** Again, this is a *syn-addition* epoxidation.\n\n3.  **Stereochemistry of Epoxidation:** When a symmetrical *cis*-alkene undergoes epoxidation, it forms a *cis*-epoxide. Because the starting material is symmetrical, the resulting epoxide has a plane of symmetry and is a *meso* compound.\n    -   (Z)-oct-4-ene → meso-(4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n4.  **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This performs an *anti*-dihydroxylation via backside attack of water.\n\n5.  **Stereochemistry of Ring Opening:** We start with the single meso-epoxide.\n    -   **For meso-(4R,5S)-epoxide:** Water can attack C4 or C5. These two attacks are equally likely.\n        -   Attack at C4 (which has R configuration): Inverts the configuration at C4 from R to S. C5 remains S. Product: **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n        -   Attack at C5 (which has S configuration): Inverts the configuration at C5 from S to R. C4 remains R. Product: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n    -   The two products, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are enantiomers. Since the two pathways of attack are equally probable, they are formed in equal amounts.\n\n6.  **Product of Reaction 2:** The product is a **racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's look at the stereochemical relationships:\n-   (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are **enantiomers**.\n-   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    -   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    -   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated.\n    -   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated.\n    -   Therefore, the meso-diol will have a different retention time from the enantiomeric pair. The two enantiomers will elute together as a single peak.\n    -   The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso compound and one for the racemic pair.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    -   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n    -   It can also separate diastereomers.\n    -   Since all three stereoisomers in the mixture are chemically distinct in a chiral environment, they will all be separated from one another (assuming ideal resolution).\n    -   The chromatogram will show **3 peaks**: one for the meso compound, one for the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S)-enantiomer.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe **2 peaks** in the standard HPLC chromatogram and **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
