  "response_list": [
    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the IR Spectrum of Compound X**\n    *   A very broad absorption between 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid that exists as a hydrogen-bonded dimer.\n    *   A strong, sharp absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   Absorptions at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ are characteristic of C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Compound X**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** The signal far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is a classic chemical shift for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The 'bs' (broad singlet) nature also supports this assignment.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is highly indicative of a *para* (1,4)-disubstituted benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is likely ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm is ortho to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n    *   **Alkyl Group Analysis:** We need to determine the structure of the second substituent on the ring using the remaining signals:\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This is a terminal ethyl fragment (-CH₂CH₃).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons. This is the methylene group (-CH₂-) from the ethyl fragment. It is adjacent to the terminal methyl group (0.9 ppm) and likely a methine group (-CH-), causing it to be a multiplet.\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates another methyl group (-CH₃) attached to a single proton (a methine group, -CH-).\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton. This is the methine group (-CH-). It is attached directly to the aromatic ring (explaining its downfield shift compared to other alkyl protons) and is coupled to the adjacent methyl group (1.4 ppm) and methylene group (1.7 ppm).\n    *   **Assembling the Alkyl Group:** Putting these pieces together -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃) gives a **sec-butyl** group.\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify the Structure of Compound X**\n    *   Based on the analysis, Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The structure is a benzene ring substituted at the 1 and 4 positions with a carboxylic acid group and a sec-butyl group, respectively. This corresponds to option D, but the question asks for the product of the subsequent reaction.\n\n*   **Step 4: Determine the Reaction and Final Product**\n    *   The reaction is carried out with **red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI)**. This is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) completely to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   The sec-butyl group and the aromatic ring are stable under these conditions and will not be altered.\n    *   Therefore, the reaction reduces the carboxylic acid group of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid to a methyl group.\n    *   **Starting Material:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n    *   **Product:** The -COOH is replaced by -CH₃. The product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Step 5: Match the Product with the Given Options**\n    *   A) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect alkyl group.\n    *   B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect structure; the reactant is not reduced.\n    *   C) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This matches our deduced product.\n    *   D) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material, Compound X.\n\nThe final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>"
