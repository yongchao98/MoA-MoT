    "The user is asking to identify a specific immunological process based on a described experiment.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the experimental setup and observations:**\n    *   **Antigen:** Rotavirus inner capsid proteins tagged with GFP.\n    *   **Delivery:** Oral gavage in mice. This targets the gastrointestinal-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT).\n    *   **Location of interest:** Peyer's patches, which are secondary lymphoid organs in the small intestine, a key part of GALT.\n    *   **Observation 1:** The antigen (fluorescent protein) is found in Peyer's patches. This means the antigen has been taken up by antigen-presenting cells (like M cells and dendritic cells) and has initiated an immune response.\n    *   **Observation 2:** A \"proliferating cell population\" is isolated. In a secondary lymphoid organ, after antigen encounter, this proliferation is characteristic of a germinal center reaction where B cells and T cells are activated.\n    *   **Observation 3:** The \"variable heavy chain gene\" is sequenced. This points specifically to B cells, as they are the cells that have immunoglobulin genes with variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) segments that form the variable heavy chain.\n    *   **Observation 4:** \"High variability\" is found in the variable heavy chain gene *among this proliferating population*. This is the key piece of information.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the options in the context of the observations:**\n    *   **A) VDJ recombination:** This is the process that initially generates the diverse repertoire of B cell receptors. It occurs in the bone marrow (a primary lymphoid organ) during the development of B cells, *before* they encounter an antigen. The process described in the question happens in a secondary lymphoid organ *after* antigen exposure. Therefore, VDJ recombination is not the process being observed in the proliferating cells.\n    *   **B) Class switching recombination:** This process changes the constant region of the heavy chain (e.g., from IgM to IgG or IgA), which alters the antibody's effector function. It does *not* affect the variable region, which is responsible for antigen binding. The question explicitly states that the variability is in the *variable heavy chain gene*. So, class switching is not the correct answer.\n    *   **C) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This process occurs in activated B cells within the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches). It introduces point mutations at a high rate into the variable regions of the immunoglobulin genes. This creates a population of B cells with slightly different receptors. Those B cells whose mutations lead to higher affinity for the antigen are preferentially selected to survive and proliferate. This process is the direct cause of the \"high variability\" observed in the variable heavy chain gene of the proliferating B cell population after antigen stimulation. This perfectly matches the scenario.\n    *   **D) Complement activation:** This is a component of the innate and adaptive immune system involving a cascade of plasma proteins. It does not involve genetic changes in B cells.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of a proliferating cell population within a Peyer's patch following antigen exposure is the hallmark of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
