    "Here's a step-by-step derivation to find the energy spectrum of the quantum particle.\n\n**1. Understand the Potential**\n\nThe particle moves in a 2D potential given in polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$:\n$V(r, \\theta) = \\frac{1}{2} k r^2 + \\frac{3}{2} k r^2 \\cos^2(\\theta)$\n\nThe Schrödinger equation is generally difficult to solve in polar coordinates unless the potential is of a specific separable form (like $V(r, \\theta) = f(r) + g(\\theta)/r^2$). The given potential is not of this form. This suggests that switching to a different coordinate system might simplify the problem.\n\n**2. Convert the Potential to Cartesian Coordinates**\n\nLet's express the potential in Cartesian coordinates $(x, y)$. The conversion formulas are:\n$x = r \\cos(\\theta)$\n$y = r \\sin(\\theta)$\n$r^2 = x^2 + y^2$\n\nNow, we substitute these into the potential expression:\nThe first term is:\n$\\frac{1}{2} k r^2 = \\frac{1}{2} k (x^2 + y^2)$\n\nThe second term involves $r \\cos(\\theta)$, which is simply $x$:\n$\\frac{3}{2} k r^2 \\cos^2(\\theta) = \\frac{3}{2} k (r \\cos(\\theta))^2 = \\frac{3}{2} k x^2$\n\nAdding the two terms together gives the potential in Cartesian coordinates:\n$V(x, y) = \\frac{1}{2} k (x^2 + y^2) + \\frac{3}{2} k x^2$\n$V(x, y) = \\frac{1}{2} k x^2 + \\frac{1}{2} k y^2 + \\frac{3}{2} k x^2$\n$V(x, y) = (\\frac{1}{2} k + \\frac{3}{2} k) x^2 + \\frac{1}{2} k y^2$\n$V(x, y) = 2 k x^2 + \\frac{1}{2} k y^2$\n\n**3. Analyze the Separated Potential**\n\nThe potential in Cartesian coordinates is separable, meaning it can be written as a sum of a function of x and a function of y:\n$V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)$\nwhere:\n$V_x(x) = 2 k x^2$\n$V_y(y) = \\frac{1}{2} k y^2$\n\nThis is the potential for a 2D anisotropic harmonic oscillator.\n\n**4. Solve the Schrödinger Equation**\n\nThe time-independent Schrödinger equation in 2D is:\n$-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} (\\frac{\\partial^2 \\Psi}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 \\Psi}{\\partial y^2}) + (V_x(x) + V_y(y)) \\Psi = E \\Psi$\n\nBecause the potential is separable, the equation can be solved by the method of separation of variables. We assume the total wavefunction $\\Psi(x, y)$ is a product of two 1D wavefunctions, $\\Psi(x, y) = \\psi_x(x) \\psi_y(y)$, and the total energy $E$ is the sum of energies for each direction, $E = E_x + E_y$.\n\nThis splits the 2D equation into two independent 1D Schrödinger equations:\n\n*   **For the x-direction:**\n    $-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{d^2 \\psi_x}{dx^2} + 2k x^2 \\psi_x = E_x \\psi_x$\n    This is the equation for a 1D quantum harmonic oscillator with potential $V_x(x) = \\frac{1}{2} k_x x^2$, where the effective spring constant is $k_x = 4k$. The angular frequency is $\\omega_x = \\sqrt{k_x/m} = \\sqrt{4k/m} = 2\\sqrt{k/m}$.\n    The energy eigenvalues are given by $E_x = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\omega_x$, where $n_x = 0, 1, 2, ...$\n    $E_x = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar (2\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}})$\n\n*   **For the y-direction:**\n    $-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{d^2 \\psi_y}{dy^2} + \\frac{1}{2}k y^2 \\psi_y = E_y \\psi_y$\n    This is also a 1D quantum harmonic oscillator with potential $V_y(y) = \\frac{1}{2} k_y y^2$, where the spring constant is $k_y = k$. The angular frequency is $\\omega_y = \\sqrt{k_y/m} = \\sqrt{k/m}$.\n    The energy eigenvalues are given by $E_y = (n_y + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\omega_y$, where $n_y = 0, 1, 2, ...$\n    $E_y = (n_y + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n\n**5. Determine the Total Energy Spectrum**\n\nThe total energy $E$ is the sum of $E_x$ and $E_y$:\n$E = E_x + E_y$\n$E = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar (2\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}) + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n\nNow, let's simplify the expression:\n$E = [2(n_x + \\frac{1}{2}) + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})] \\hbar \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n$E = [2n_x + 1 + n_y + \\frac{1}{2}] \\hbar \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n$E = (2n_x + n_y + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n\n**6. Compare with the Options**\n\nThe calculated energy spectrum is $E = (2n_x + n_y + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$.\nThis matches option A.\n\nA) $E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*\\sqrt{k/m}$\nB) $E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))$\nC) $E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))$\nD) $E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))$\n\n<<<A>>>"
