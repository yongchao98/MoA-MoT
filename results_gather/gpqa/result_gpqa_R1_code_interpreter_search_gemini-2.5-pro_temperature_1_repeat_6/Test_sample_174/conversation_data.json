    "This is a classic problem in electromagnetism concerning radiation from an oscillating source. Let's break down the problem into two parts: the angular dependence of the radiated power and its dependence on the wavelength.\n\n### Part 1: Angular Dependence of Radiated Power\n\n1.  **Modeling the Source:** The problem describes an oscillating charge distribution with a spheroid shape and a symmetry axis (z-axis). The simplest and most dominant form of radiation from such a compact, oscillating source is electric dipole radiation. The spheroid shape, not being spherically symmetric, allows for a net oscillating electric dipole moment. We will model the source as an oscillating electric dipole with its moment `p` aligned along the z-axis.\n\n2.  **Power Formula:** The time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle `(dP/dΩ)` by an oscillating electric dipole is given by:\n    `dP/dΩ = C * sin²(θ)`\n    where `θ` is the angle measured from the axis of the dipole (the z-axis), and `C` is a constant that depends on the frequency and the amplitude of the dipole moment.\n\n3.  **Maximum Power (A):** The radiated power is maximum when `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin²(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (or `π/2` radians), i.e., in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis.\n    So, the maximum power per unit solid angle, `A`, is:\n    `A = (dP/dΩ)_max = C * (1) = C`\n\n4.  **Power at θ = 30°:** We need to find the power radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`. We use the same formula:\n    `(dP/dΩ)_(θ=30°) = C * sin²(30°)`\n\n5.  **Fraction of Maximum Power:** The fraction of the maximum power `A` that is radiated at `θ = 30°` is the ratio:\n    `Fraction = (dP/dΩ)_(θ=30°) / A = (C * sin²(30°)) / C = sin²(30°)`\n\n6.  **Calculation:** We know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\n    Therefore, the fraction is `(1/2)² = 1/4`.\n\nThis result eliminates options B and C.\n\n### Part 2: Wavelength Dependence\n\n1.  **Relating Power to Wavelength:** The constant `C` in the power formula `dP/dΩ = C * sin²(θ)` is not truly constant but depends on the frequency of oscillation. For electric dipole radiation, the radiated power is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency `ω`.\n    `dP/dΩ ∝ ω⁴`\n\n2.  **Frequency and Wavelength:** The angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` and the speed of light `c` by the formula:\n    `ω = 2πf = 2π(c/λ)`\n\n3.  **Substituting for Wavelength:** We can substitute this relation into the proportionality for the power:\n    `dP/dΩ ∝ ω⁴ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`\n\n4.  **Form of the function f(λ, θ):** This means the function `f(λ, θ)` for the radiated power per unit solid angle has a dependence of `λ⁻⁴`. This inverse fourth power relationship is characteristic of dipole radiation and is also famously known from Rayleigh scattering.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining the results from both parts:\n*   The fraction of the maximum power `A` radiated at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n*   A possible form for the wavelength dependence of the function `f` is **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nThese two results correspond to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
