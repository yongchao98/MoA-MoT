    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus of mass `M` is at rest. Its rest-mass energy `E_initial = M * c^2 = 300 GeV`. Since it's at rest, its initial momentum `P_initial` is 0.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`. They are moving, so they have kinetic energies `T1` and `T2`, and momenta `p1` and `p2`.\n\n**2. Use the Given Information to Find Masses and Q-value**\n\n*   We are given `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   We are also given that the sum of the final rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n*   We can solve for `m1` and `m2` in terms of `M`:\n    *   Substitute `m1 = 2 * m2` into the sum: `2 * m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    *   `3 * m2 = 0.99 * M` => `m2 = 0.33 * M`\n    *   `m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n*   Now, we can find their rest-mass energies:\n    *   `m1 * c^2 = 0.66 * (M * c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`\n    *   `m2 * c^2 = 0.33 * (M * c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`\n*   The total kinetic energy released in the fission (the Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final total rest-mass energy.\n    *   `T_total = T1 + T2 = E_initial - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n    *   `T_total = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n    *   `T_total = 3000 MeV`\n\n**3. Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n\n*   Since the initial nucleus was at rest (`P_initial = 0`), the total final momentum must also be zero.\n*   `p1 + p2 = 0`, which means the momenta of the two fragments are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n\n**4. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Mechanics**\n\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   `T1 = p^2 / (2*m1)` and `T2 = p^2 / (2*m2)`.\n*   We can find the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n    *   `T1 / T2 = (p^2 / (2*m1)) / (p^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1`\n*   Since `m1 = 2*m2`, the ratio `m2 / m1 = 1/2`.\n*   So, `T1 / T2 = 1/2`, which implies `T2 = 2 * T1`.\n*   Now, use the total kinetic energy:\n    *   `T1 + T2 = T_total`\n    *   `T1 + 2*T1 = 3 GeV`\n    *   `3 * T1 = 3 GeV`\n    *   `T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`\n\n**5. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)**\n\n*   The relativistic relationship between energy, momentum, and mass is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n*   The total energy `E` is the sum of kinetic energy `T` and rest-mass energy `m*c^2`: `E = T + m*c^2`.\n*   Substituting this into the first equation: `(T + m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n*   Expanding the left side: `T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2) + (m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n*   This simplifies to an expression for momentum: `(p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2)`.\n*   Since the magnitudes of the momenta are equal (`p1 = p2`), their squares are also equal:\n    *   `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`\n    *   `T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n*   We know `T2 = T_total - T1 = 3 GeV - T1`, `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, and `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`. Substitute these values:\n    *   `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n    *   `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n    *   `T1^2 + 396*T1 = T1^2 - 204*T1 + 603`\n*   Simplify the equation:\n    *   `396*T1 = -204*T1 + 603`\n    *   `396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n    *   `600 * T1 = 603`\n    *   `T1_relativistic = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV`\n\n**6. Find the Difference**\n\n*   `Difference = T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\n*   `Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\nTo confirm the result, the following Python code executes the same calculation.\n```python\n# All energy values are in GeV.\n\n# --- Step 1: Define initial values and calculate fragment properties ---\nM_c2 = 300.0  # Initial rest-mass energy in GeV\n\n# Calculate the rest-mass energies of the two fragments\n# Given: m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M and m1 = 2 * m2\n# 3 * m2 = 0.99 * M => m2 = 0.33 * M\nm2_c2 = 0.33 * M_c2\nm1_c2 = 2.0 * m2_c2\n\n# --- Step 2: Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value) ---\nT_total = M_c2 - (m1_c2 + m2_c2)\n\n# --- Step 3: Calculate T1 using the classical approximation ---\n# In the classical limit, T1/T2 = m2/m1 = 1/2.\n# T1 + T2 = T_total => T1 + 2*T1 = T_total => 3*T1 = T_total\nT1_classical = T_total / 3.0\n\n# --- Step 4: Calculate T1 using the correct relativistic formula ---\n# The equation derived from conservation of momentum is: 600 * T1 = 603\nT1_relativistic = 603.0 / 600.0\n\n# --- Step 5: Calculate the difference in MeV ---\n# Convert GeV to MeV by multiplying by 1000\ndifference_MeV = (T1_relativistic - T1_classical) * 1000\n\nprint(difference_MeV)\n```\n>5.0\n\nThe difference between the correct relativistic kinetic energy and the value from the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus of mass `M` is at rest. Its rest-mass energy `E_initial = M * c^2 = 300 GeV`. Since it's at rest, its initial momentum `P_initial` is 0.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`. They are moving, so they have kinetic energies `T1` and `T2`, and momenta `p1` and `p2`.\n\n**2. Use the Given Information to Find Masses and Q-value**\n\n*   We are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let `m1` be the more massive fragment and `m2` be the less massive one. So, `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   We are also given that the sum of the final rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n*   We can solve for `m1` and `m2` in terms of `M`:\n    *   Substitute `m1 = 2 * m2` into the sum: `2 * m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    *   `3 * m2 = 0.99 * M` => `m2 = 0.33 * M`\n    *   `m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n*   Now, we can find their rest-mass energies:\n    *   `m1 * c^2 = 0.66 * (M * c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`\n    *   `m2 * c^2 = 0.33 * (M * c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`\n*   The total kinetic energy released in the fission (the Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final total rest-mass energy. This comes from the conservation of energy (`E_initial = E_final`).\n    *   `M*c^2 = (m1*c^2 + T1) + (m2*c^2 + T2)`\n    *   `T_total = T1 + T2 = M*c^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n    *   `T_total = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n    *   In MeV, `T_total = 3000 MeV`.\n\n**3. Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n\n*   Since the initial nucleus was at rest (`P_initial = 0`), the total final momentum must also be zero according to the law of conservation of momentum.\n*   `p1 + p2 = 0` (as vectors), which means the momenta of the two fragments are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n\n**4. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Mechanics**\n\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy `T` is related to momentum `p` by `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   `T1 = p^2 / (2*m1)` and `T2 = p^2 / (2*m2)`.\n*   We can find the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n    *   `T1 / T2 = (p^2 / (2*m1)) / (p^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1`\n*   Since `m1 = 2*m2`, the ratio `m2 / m1 = 1/2`.\n*   So, `T1 / T2 = 1/2`, which implies `T2 = 2 * T1`.\n*   Now, use the total kinetic energy:\n    *   `T1 + T2 = T_total`\n    *   `T1 + 2*T1 = 3 GeV`\n    *   `3 * T1 = 3 GeV`\n    *   `T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`\n\n**5.
