    "This problem is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time, which can be expressed as:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n\nHere, ΔE is the uncertainty in energy, Δt is the uncertainty in time, and ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h/2π).\n\nFor an unstable quantum state with a lifetime τ, the lifetime is taken as the uncertainty in time (Δt ≈ τ). This implies that the energy of the state is not perfectly defined but has an inherent uncertainty or \"width\" (also called natural linewidth, Γ) given by:\n\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\nTo distinguish or \"clearly resolve\" two energy levels, the difference in their energies, |E2 - E1|, must be greater than their energy uncertainties. A common and practical criterion is that the energy separation must be at least as large as the larger of the two energy widths.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the constants and given values.**\n- Lifetime of state 1, τ1 = 10⁻⁹ s\n- Lifetime of state 2, τ2 = 10⁻⁸ s\n- Reduced Planck constant, ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the energy uncertainty (linewidth) for each state.**\n\n-   **For State 1:**\n    ΔE₁ = ħ / τ₁\n    ΔE₁ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s)\n    ΔE₁ = 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n-   **For State 2:**\n    ΔE₂ = ħ / τ₂\n    ΔE₂ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s)\n    ΔE₂ = 6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n**Step 3: Determine the condition for resolving the two energy levels.**\nThe state with the shorter lifetime (State 1) has the larger energy uncertainty (ΔE₁ > ΔE₂). To clearly distinguish the two levels, the energy difference between them must be greater than this larger uncertainty.\n\nCondition for resolution: |E₂ - E₁| > ΔE₁\n|E₂ - E₁| > 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**Step 4: Compare this requirement with the given options.**\n-   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV: This is much smaller than 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would overlap completely.\n-   B) 10⁻⁴ eV: This is much larger than 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV (since 10⁻⁴ = 1000 × 10⁻⁷). The levels would be clearly separated.\n-   C) 10⁻⁸ eV: This is smaller than 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would significantly overlap.\n-   D) 10⁻⁹ eV: This is much smaller than 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would overlap completely.\n\nThe only energy difference that is large enough to ensure the two energy levels can be clearly resolved is 10⁻⁴ eV.\n\n```python\n#\n# Constants\n# h_bar_eVs: Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nh_bar_eVs = 6.582119569e-16\n\n# Given lifetimes in seconds\ntau1 = 1e-9\ntau2 = 1e-8\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty (linewidth) for each state using the formula: Delta_E = h_bar / tau\ndelta_E1 = h_bar_eVs / tau1\ndelta_E2 = h_bar_eVs / tau2\n\n# The larger of the two uncertainties determines the minimum separation needed for resolution.\n# For the states to be clearly resolved, the energy difference must be greater than this larger uncertainty.\nlarger_uncertainty = max(delta_E1, delta_E2)\n\n# Print the results\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty for state 1 (lifetime {tau1} s): {delta_E1:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty for state 2 (lifetime {tau2} s): {delta_E2:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"The minimum energy separation required for resolution must be greater than the larger uncertainty, which is {larger_uncertainty:.3e} eV.\")\n\n# Check the given options against this requirement.\noptions = {\n    \"A\": 1e-11,\n    \"B\": 1e-4,\n    \"C\": 1e-8,\n    \"D\": 1e-9\n}\nprint(\"\\n--- Checking the options ---\")\nfor option, value in options.items():\n    if value > larger_uncertainty:\n        print(f\"Option {option} ({value:.1e} eV) is a valid energy difference.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Option {option} ({value:.1e} eV) is NOT a valid energy difference.\")\n```\n<execute_result>\nEnergy uncertainty for state 1 (lifetime 1e-09 s): 6.582e-07 eV\nEnergy uncertainty for state 2 (lifetime 1e-08 s): 6.582e-08 eV\nThe minimum energy separation required for resolution must be greater than the larger uncertainty, which is 6.582e-07 eV.\n\n--- Checking the options ---\nOption A (1.0e-11 eV) is NOT a valid energy difference.\nOption B (1.0e-04 eV) is a valid energy difference.\nOption C (1.0e-08 eV) is NOT a valid energy difference.\nOption D (1.0e-09 eV) is NOT a valid energy difference.\n</execute_result>\n\n<<<B>>>",
