    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning to determine which exoplanet has the highest density:\n\n1.  **Analyze Planet a):** This planet is identical to Earth, with the same mass and radius. Its density serves as our baseline, which is approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n2.  **Analyze Planet b):** This planet's density is explicitly stated as approximately 5.5 g/cm³. This is virtually the same as Earth's density.\n\n3.  **Analyze Planet c):** This planet has the same composition as Earth but is 5 times more massive. For planets with the same composition, a more massive planet will have stronger internal gravity. This increased gravitational force compresses the planet's material (rock and iron) much more tightly. Tighter compression means more mass is packed into a given volume, resulting in a higher overall density. Therefore, this planet's density will be significantly greater than Earth's.\n\n4.  **Analyze Planet d):** This planet has the same composition as Earth but is only half as massive. Following the same logic as above, but in reverse, the weaker gravity of this less massive planet will lead to less compression of its materials. Consequently, its density will be lower than Earth's.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Planet (a) and (b) have a density of ~5.5 g/cm³.\n*   Planet (d) has a density *lower* than 5.5 g/cm³.\n*   Planet (c) has a density *higher* than 5.5 g/cm³ due to gravitational compression.\n\nTherefore, the planet with the highest density is the one with the same composition as Earth but 5 times the mass.\n\n<<<C>>>"
