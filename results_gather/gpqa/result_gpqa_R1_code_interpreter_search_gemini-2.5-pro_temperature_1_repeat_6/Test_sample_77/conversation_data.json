    "*   **1. Understanding the problem setup:**\n    *   We have a point charge `q` moving along a path described by the vector function `s(t)`.\n    *   We want to find the electric scalar potential `V` and magnetic vector potential `A` at a specific point in space `r` and at a specific time `t`.\n    *   Electromagnetic fields (and thus potentials) propagate at the speed of light, `c`. This means the potential at `(r, t)` is determined by the state of the charge at an earlier time, called the retarded time, `tr`.\n    *   The retarded time `tr` is the time when the charge emitted the signal that reaches the observation point `r` at time `t`. The time delay is the travel time of light over the distance between the emission point and the observation point.\n    *   The position of the charge at the retarded time is `s(tr)`.\n    *   The vector from the emission point to the observation point is `d = r - s(tr)`. Its magnitude is `d = |d| = |r - s(tr)|`.\n    *   The time delay is `d/c`. Therefore, the retarded time `tr` is related to the observation time `t` by the equation: `t = tr + d/c` or `tr = t - d/c`.\n    *   The velocity of the charge at the retarded time is `v = ds(t)/dt` evaluated at `t = tr`, which we denote as `v(tr)`.\n\n*   **2. The Liénard-Wiechert Potentials:**\n    The potentials for a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. They are derived from Maxwell's equations by solving for the retarded potentials for a point source. The standard derivation, which involves integrating over the charge distribution represented by a Dirac delta function and accounting for the time-retardation effect, yields the following results:\n\n    *   **Scalar Potential (V):**\n        The scalar potential `V(r, t)` is given by:\n        `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (d - d⋅v/c)]`\n        The term `d - d⋅v/c` in the denominator accounts for the relativistic effects of the moving source, including the length of the \"packet\" of field lines being compressed or stretched due to the motion of the source (similar to the Doppler effect for waves).\n\n    *   **Vector Potential (A):**\n        The vector potential `A(r, t)` is given by:\n        `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q v / (d - d⋅v/c)]`\n\n*   **3. Matching with the given options:**\n    Let's manipulate the denominators of the derived expressions to match the format in the options.\n    The common denominator is `d - d⋅v/c`. We can rewrite this by factoring out `1/c`:\n    `d - d⋅v/c = (cd - d⋅v) / c`\n\n    Now substitute this back into the expressions for `V` and `A`:\n\n    *   For `V`:\n        `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / ((cd - d⋅v)/c)] = (1 / 4πε₀) * [qc / (cd - d⋅v)]`\n        `V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d⋅v))`\n\n    *   For `A`:\n        `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q v / ((cd - d⋅v)/c)] = (μ₀ / 4π) * [qc v / (cd - d⋅v)]`\n        `A(r,t) = μ₀ qc v / (4π (dc - d⋅v))`\n\n*   **4. Comparing with the choices:**\n    *   **A) V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d⋅v)),  A(r,t) = μ₀ qc v / (4π (dc - d⋅v))**\n        This exactly matches our derived expressions.\n\n    *   **B) V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc + d⋅v)),  A(r,t) = μ₀ qc v / (4π (dc + d⋅v))**\n        The sign in the denominator is positive, which is incorrect. The minus sign is crucial and arises from the derivative of the retardation condition. A plus sign would correspond to an unphysical advanced potential.\n\n    *   **C) V(r,t) = q / (4πε₀ r), A(r,t) = (v/c²) V(r,t)**\n        The expression for `V` is the static Coulomb potential, which does not account for retardation or the motion of the charge. It is only valid for a stationary charge (`v=0`). Therefore, this is incorrect for a general moving charge.\n\n    *   **D) V(r,t) = q / (4πε₀ r),  A(r,t) = (v²/c²) V(r,t)**\n        The expression for `V` is incorrect for the same reason as in C. The relation for `A` is also dimensionally incorrect (`A` should have units of V·s/m, but `(v²/c²)V` has units of V).\n\n*   **5. Conclusion:**\n    The correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge (the Liénard-Wiechert potentials) are given in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
