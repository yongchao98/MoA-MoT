    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of product 3 and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n**Step 1: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid.**\n*   **Reaction:** This is the electrophilic nitration of toluene. Toluene (C₆H₅CH₃) has a methyl group (-CH₃), which is an electron-donating group and an ortho-, para-director.\n*   **Products:** The reaction yields a mixture of ortho-nitrotoluene and para-nitrotoluene. Due to steric hindrance, the para isomer is the major product. We will assume the reaction proceeds with the major product.\n*   **Product 1:** para-nitrotoluene (4-nitrotoluene).\n    *   Structure: A benzene ring with a -CH₃ group and a -NO₂ group at opposite (para) positions.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is treated with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄.**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1 (p-nitrotoluene).\n*   **Reagents:** Manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). These reagents constitute an oxidizing agent.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction is the oxidation of the benzylic methyl group. While strong oxidants like KMnO₄ would oxidize the -CH₃ group all the way to a carboxylic acid (-COOH), MnO₂ is often used as a milder, more selective oxidizing agent, capable of oxidizing a benzylic methyl group to an aldehyde (-CHO) without over-oxidation, especially when compared to permanganate. This is a crucial interpretation point. Let's assume the milder oxidation occurs.\n*   **Product 2:** para-nitrobenzaldehyde (4-nitrobenzaldehyde).\n    *   Structure: A benzene ring with a -CHO group and a -NO₂ group at para positions.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide.**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (p-nitrobenzaldehyde) and acetone ((CH₃)₂C=O).\n*   **Reagents:** Aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH), a base.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a base-catalyzed crossed aldol condensation, specifically a Claisen-Schmidt condensation, because p-nitrobenzaldehyde has no α-hydrogens.\n    1.  The base (OH⁻) removes an acidic α-proton from acetone to form an enolate ion (⁻CH₂COCH₃).\n    2.  The nucleophilic enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of p-nitrobenzaldehyde.\n    3.  This forms an aldol addition intermediate: 4-O₂N-C₆H₄-CH(OH)-CH₂COCH₃.\n    4.  This intermediate readily undergoes dehydration (elimination of a water molecule) because the resulting C=C double bond is in conjugation with both the aromatic ring and the ketone carbonyl group, which leads to a very stable product.\n*   **Product 3:** (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one. The E-isomer (trans) is favored over the Z-isomer (cis) due to lower steric hindrance.\n    *   Structure: O₂N-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)CH₃. The p-nitrophenyl group and the acetyl group are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n\n**Symmetry Analysis of Product 3**\nNow, let's determine the molecular symmetry group of (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n\n1.  **Planarity:** The molecule has an extended system of conjugated π-bonds (aromatic ring, C=C double bond, C=O double bond). This forces the main skeleton of the molecule to be planar.\n\n2.  **Symmetry Elements:** We check for the presence of symmetry elements in this planar molecule.\n    *   **Identity (E):** All molecules have this.\n    *   **Center of Inversion (i):** No. For example, inverting the -NO₂ group through the center of the molecule does not land on another -NO₂ group.\n    *   **Rotation Axes (Cₙ):** No. There are no axes of rotation (other than the trivial C₁). Rotating the molecule by 180° (C₂) or any other angle will not result in an identical orientation because the two ends of the molecule are different (a p-nitrophenyl group vs. an acetyl group).\n    *   **Mirror Plane (σ):** Yes. The plane in which the molecule lies is a mirror plane (often denoted σₕ if the principal axis were perpendicular to it, but here it's simply σ). It reflects the top half of each atom onto its bottom half. There are no other mirror planes (e.g., perpendicular to the molecular plane).\n\n3.  **Point Group:** A molecule that possesses only the identity element (E) and a single mirror plane (σ) belongs to the **Cₛ** point group.\n\nThe other options are incorrect:\n*   **D₂h** and **C₂h** are high-symmetry groups that require a center of inversion, which Product 3 lacks.\n*   **C₃** requires a three-fold axis of rotation, which is clearly absent.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of Product 3 is Cₛ.\n\n<<<B>>>"
