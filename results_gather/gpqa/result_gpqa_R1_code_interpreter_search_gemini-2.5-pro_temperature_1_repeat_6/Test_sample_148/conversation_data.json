    "*   **Analyze the problem:** We have a synthetic peptide with unusual analytical data.\n    1.  **1H NMR:** A single alpha-proton appears as two separate peaks with similar chemical shifts and equal integrals (totaling 1H). This means the proton exists in two distinct chemical environments. Spin-spin coupling is ruled out.\n    2.  **LC-MS:** At elevated temperature, the sample separates into two distinct peaks in the liquid chromatography (LC) trace. The peaks have equal intensities. The mass spectrometry (MS) data for both peaks is identical and matches the expected mass of the product.\n\n*   **Evaluate the options based on the evidence:**\n\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent and on a standard (achiral) LC column, enantiomers are indistinguishable. They would produce a single set of NMR peaks and a single peak in the LC. This contradicts both the NMR and LC-MS data.\n\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images. They have different physical and chemical properties.\n        *   **NMR:** Because they are chemically distinct, diastereomers give different NMR spectra. A proton in one diastereomer would have a different chemical shift from the same proton in the other diastereomer. This would explain the two peaks for the alpha-proton. The equal integrals suggest the two diastereomers are present in a roughly 1:1 ratio.\n        *   **LC-MS:** Because they have different physical properties, diastereomers can often be separated by standard (achiral) chromatography. This would explain the two peaks in the LC trace. Since they are isomers, they have the same molecular formula and therefore the same mass, which is consistent with both LC peaks having the same mass spectrum.\n        *   **Source in peptides:** A very common source of diastereomerism in peptides is restricted rotation around the amide (C-N) bond. This creates stable *cis* and *trans* conformers. These conformers are diastereomers (specifically, rotamers or atropisomers) and can be observed as separate species by NMR and LC, especially if the rotation is slow on the experimental timescale. The fact that the LC was run at an \"elevated temperature\" suggests the experimenters might be trying to study or resolve this interconversion. This explanation is fully consistent with all observations.\n\n    *   **C) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This would create a new molecule with a different chemical structure and a significantly higher molecular weight. The mass spectrum would not match the expected product. This contradicts the MS data.\n\n    *   **D) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor would be a different molecule with a different molecular weight. The mass spectrum of the contaminant peak would be different from the product peak. This contradicts the MS data, which shows both peaks have the same mass.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of two separable isomers with the same mass is the hallmark of diastereomers. In the context of a peptide, this is most likely due to *cis/trans* isomerization around an amide bond.\n\n<<<B>>>"
