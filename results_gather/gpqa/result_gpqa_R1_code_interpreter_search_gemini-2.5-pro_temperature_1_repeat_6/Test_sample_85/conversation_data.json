    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe product in both reactions, after cyclization, is a substituted tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered lactone (a delta-lactone). The structure is named 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, with the stereochemistry at the C4 position specified as either (R) or (S).\n\n*   **Structure:** A six-membered ring containing an oxygen atom (O1), a carbonyl group at C2, and an ethyl group at the C4 chiral center.\n*   **Formation:** Such a lactone is formed from a 5-hydroxyalkanoic acid. In this specific case, the open-chain precursor that cyclizes to form the lactone is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    HOOC(C1)-CH₂(C2)-CH(Et)(C3)-CH₂(C4)-CH₂OH(C5)\n    The hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the carboxylic acid at C1 to form a six-membered ring.\n*   **Chiral Center:** The chiral center in the starting dicarboxylic acid derivative is at C3. After the reaction and cyclization, this C3 becomes the C4 of the lactone. We must track the stereochemistry from C3 of the reactant to C4 of the product.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Materials and Reagents**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options provided are enantiomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule is a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid, where one carboxylic acid group is free (-COOH) and the other is an isobutyl ester (-COOiBu).\n    Structure: HOOC-CH₂(C2)-CH(Et)(C3)-CH₂(C4)-C(=O)O-iBu\n*   **Reagent for Reaction 1 (A -> Product):** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride). LiBH₄ is a selective reducing agent that reduces esters and ketones but does *not* typically reduce carboxylic acids under these conditions.\n*   **Reagent for Reaction 2 (B -> Product):** BH₃ (Borane). BH₃ is a selective reducing agent that rapidly reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols but reduces esters much more slowly.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction 1 (Starting material A with LiBH₄)**\n\n1.  **Selective Reduction:** LiBH₄ will reduce the ester group (-COOiBu) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), leaving the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) untouched.\n    A (HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu) + LiBH₄ → HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH\n2.  **Cyclization:** The resulting molecule, 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid, cyclizes upon acidic workup (H⁺) to form the lactone product.\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** We need to determine if the configuration at the chiral center is retained or inverted. Let's assign Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities to the groups attached to the chiral center (C3 in the starting material, C4 in the product).\n    *   **Priorities in Starting Material (A):** The chiral center C3 is attached to -H, -CH₂CH₃ (ethyl), -CH₂COOH, and -CH₂COOiBu.\n        - Comparing -CH₂COOH and -CH₂COOiBu: The -COOiBu group has higher priority because the oxygen is attached to a carbon (of the isobutyl group), while in -COOH, the corresponding oxygen is attached to a hydrogen.\n        - Priority order: (1) -CH₂COOiBu > (2) -CH₂COOH > (3) -CH₂CH₃ > (4) -H.\n    *   **Priorities in Product (Lactone):** The chiral center C4 is attached to -H, -CH₂CH₃ (ethyl), -CH₂-C(=O)O- (part of the ring towards C2), and -CH₂CH₂O- (part of the ring towards O1).\n        - Priority order: (1) -CH₂-C(=O)O- > (2) -CH₂CH₂O- > (3) -CH₂CH₃ > (4) -H.\n    *   **Mapping the Transformation:**\n        - The initial group 1 (-CH₂COOiBu) is reduced and becomes the -CH₂CH₂O- part of the ring (product group 2).\n        - The initial group 2 (-CH₂COOH) becomes the -CH₂-C(=O)O- part of the ring (product group 1).\n    *   **Conclusion on Stereochemistry:** The priorities of the top two groups are swapped during the reaction sequence. A swap in priorities of two groups leads to an **inversion** of the stereochemical descriptor (R becomes S, and S becomes R).\n4.  **Determining A:** The product of Reaction 1 is **(R)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Since the reaction causes an inversion, the starting material A must have the **(S)** configuration.\n    Therefore, **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction 2 (Starting material B with BH₃)**\n\n1.  **Selective Reduction:** BH₃ will reduce the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), leaving the ester group (-COOiBu) untouched.\n    B (HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu) + BH₃ → HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu\n2.  **Cyclization:** The resulting hydroxy-ester undergoes intramolecular transesterification upon acidic workup (H⁺), where the -OH group attacks the ester carbonyl, eliminating isobutanol (iBuOH) to form the lactone.\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** Let's analyze the priority changes again.\n    *   **Priorities in Starting Material (B):** Same as for A.\n        - (1) -CH₂COOiBu > (2) -CH₂COOH > (3) -CH₂CH₃ > (4) -H.\n    *   **Priorities in Product (Lactone):** Same as before.\n        - (1) -CH₂-C(=O)O- > (2) -CH₂CH₂O- > (3) -CH₂CH₃ > (4) -H.\n    *   **Mapping the Transformation:**\n        - The initial group 1 (-CH₂COOiBu) is attacked during cyclization and becomes the -CH₂-C(=O)O- part of the ring (product group 1).\n        - The initial group 2 (-CH₂COOH) is reduced and becomes the -CH₂CH₂O- part of the ring (product group 2).\n    *   **Conclusion on Stereochemistry:** The priority order of the groups is preserved (group 1 remains group 1, group 2 remains group 2). Therefore, the reaction proceeds with **retention** of configuration (R remains R, and S remains S).\n4.  **Determining B:** The product of Reaction 2 is **(S)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Since the reaction proceeds with retention, the starting material B must also have the **(S)** configuration.\n    Therefore, **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nBoth starting materials, A and B, must be the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n*   **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n*   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
