    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the initial state and the measurement outcome state.**\n    *   The initial state of the two-electron system is given in the coupled basis as `|Ψ_initial> = |l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>`.\n        *   `l_1 = 1` and `l_2 = 1` since the electrons are in p-orbitals.\n        *   `l = 2` is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number.\n        *   `m = -1` is the quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum, `L_z`. The eigenvalue of `L_z` is `mħ = -1ħ`.\n    *   The measurement is of the individual z-components of angular momentum, `L_{1z}` and `L_{2z}`.\n    *   The desired outcome is that the eigenvalue of `L_{1z}` is `-ħ` and the eigenvalue of `L_{2z}` is `-ħ`.\n        *   The eigenvalue of `L_{iz}` is `m_i ħ`.\n        *   So, the desired outcome corresponds to the quantum numbers `m_1 = -1` and `m_2 = -1`.\n    *   This measurement outcome corresponds to the state in the uncoupled basis: `|Ψ_final> = |l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2> = |1, -1; 1, -1>`.\n\n2.  **Understand the relationship between the coupled and uncoupled bases.**\n    The coupled state `|l, m>` can be expressed as a linear combination of the uncoupled states `|m_1, m_2>`:\n    `|l, m> = Σ_{m_1, m_2} C_{m_1, m_2} |m_1, m_2>`\n    The coefficients `C_{m_1, m_2}` are known as the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, often written as `<l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m>`.\n    The probability of measuring the outcome `(m_1, m_2)` when the system is in the state `|l, m>` is given by the square of the magnitude of the corresponding coefficient:\n    `P(m_1, m_2) = |<l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m>|^2`\n\n3.  **Apply the selection rule for angular momentum coupling.**\n    A fundamental rule for the coupling of angular momenta is the conservation of the z-component. The total z-component quantum number `m` must be the sum of the individual z-component quantum numbers `m_1` and `m_2`.\n    `m = m_1 + m_2`\n    If this condition is not met, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient `<l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m>` is zero.\n\n4.  **Check the selection rule for the given problem.**\n    *   From the initial state `|1, 1, 2, -1>`, we have `m = -1`.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, we have `m_1 = -1` and `m_2 = -1`.\n    *   Let's calculate the sum: `m_1 + m_2 = -1 + (-1) = -2`.\n    *   Comparing the total `m` from the initial state with the sum for the final state: `m = -1` while `m_1 + m_2 = -2`.\n    *   Since `m ≠ m_1 + m_2`, the selection rule is violated.\n\n5.  **Determine the probability.**\n    Because the selection rule `m = m_1 + m_2` is not satisfied, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for this transition is zero:\n    `<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1> = 0`\n    The joint probability is the square of this coefficient:\n    `P(m_1=-1, m_2=-1) = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>|^2 = 0^2 = 0`.\n\n**Alternative Explanation using Conservation of `L_z`:**\n\n*   The initial state `|1, 1, 2, -1>` is an eigenstate of the total z-component angular momentum operator `L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}` with eigenvalue `-ħ`. Any measurement of `L_z` on this state must yield `-ħ`.\n*   The final state corresponding to the measurement `|1, -1; 1, -1>` is also an eigenstate of `L_z`. Let's find its eigenvalue:\n    `L_z |1, -1; 1, -1> = (L_{1z} + L_{2z}) |1, -1; 1, -1>`\n    `= (L_{1z}|1, -1>)|1, -1> + |1, -1>(L_{2z}|1, -1>)`\n    `= (-ħ|1, -1>)|1, -1> + |1, -1>(-ħ|1, -1>)`\n    `= -2ħ |1, -1; 1, -1>`\n    The eigenvalue of `L_z` for the final state is `-2ħ`.\n*   A measurement on a system in an eigenstate of an operator `A` with eigenvalue `a` cannot result in a state that has a different eigenvalue `b` for the same operator `A`. Since the initial state has an `L_z` eigenvalue of `-ħ`, it is impossible to find it in a state that has an `L_z` eigenvalue of `-2ħ`. Therefore, the probability of this outcome is zero.\n\n<<<A>>>"
