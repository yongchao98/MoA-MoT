    "Answering this question requires applying the principles of the quantum rotation-vibration model for a diatomic molecule. Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Model and Energy Levels\n\nThe problem specifies the non-rigid rotor model, where the total energy of the molecule is the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies. The energy levels are defined by two quantum numbers:\n*   `v`: the vibrational quantum number (v = 0, 1, 2, ...)\n*   `J`: the rotational quantum number (J = 0, 1, 2, ...)\n\nThe total energy `E(v, J)` of a state is given by:\n`E(v, J) = E_vib + E_rot = ħω(v + 1/2) + B*J(J + 1)`\n\nwhere:\n*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n*   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration.\n*   `B` is the rotational constant, defined as `B = ħ² / (2I)`.\n*   `I` is the moment of inertia, defined as `I = μR²`.\n*   `μ` is the reduced mass of the molecule.\n\n### 2. Identifying the Transition\n\n*   **Initial State:** The molecule starts in its \"fundamental state\" (ground state), which is the state with the lowest possible energy. This corresponds to the lowest possible values for both quantum numbers: `v = 0` and `J = 0`.\n    `E_initial = E(0, 0) = ħω(0 + 1/2) + B*0*(0 + 1) = (1/2)ħω`\n\n*   **Final State:** The molecule absorbs a photon and moves to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy\". We must consider the selection rules for photon absorption in a diatomic molecule:\n    *   `Δv = +1` (for a fundamental vibrational transition).\n    *   `ΔJ = ±1`.\n\n    Since the initial state has `J = 0`, the change in `J` must be `ΔJ = +1`, meaning the final state must have `J = 1`.\n    The question provides the vibrational frequency `ω`, strongly implying that the transition involves a change in the vibrational state. A pure rotational transition (`Δv = 0, ΔJ = +1`) would have a much lower energy and would not utilize the given `ω`. Therefore, the most logical transition to consider is the lowest-energy rovibrational transition from the ground state.\n\n    This transition is from `(v=0, J=0)` to `(v=1, J=1)`.\n\n*   **Energy of the Final State:**\n    `E_final = E(1, 1) = ħω(1 + 1/2) + B*1*(1 + 1) = (3/2)ħω + 2B`\n\n### 3. Calculating the Photon's Energy and Momentum\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon, `E_photon`, must be equal to the change in the molecule's energy, `ΔE`.\n\n`ΔE = E_final - E_initial = [(3/2)ħω + 2B] - [(1/2)ħω] = ħω + 2B`\n\nThe momentum of a photon (`p`) is related to its energy by the formula `E_photon = pc`, where `c` is the speed of light. Therefore:\n\n`p = ΔE / c = (ħω + 2B) / c`\n\n### 4. Numerical Calculation\n\nNow, we will calculate the values of `μ`, `I`, `B`, `ΔE`, and finally `p`, using the provided data.\n\n*   `Mx` = 20 amu\n*   `My` = 2 amu\n*   `R` = 2 Å = 2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n*   `ω` = 4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s\n\nWe will use a Python script to perform the calculation accurately.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define physical constants in SI units\nh_bar = 1.054571817e-34  # Reduced Planck constant (J*s)\nc = 2.99792458e8         # Speed of light (m/s)\namu_to_kg = 1.660539e-27   # Atomic mass unit to kg conversion\n\n# Given parameters for the molecule\nMx_amu = 20.0\nMy_amu = 2.0\nR_m = 2.0e-10  # Bond length in meters\nw_rad_s = 4.0e14 # Angular frequency in rad/s\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the reduced mass (μ) in kg\nmu_amu = (Mx_amu * My_amu) / (Mx_amu + My_amu)\nmu_kg = mu_amu * amu_to_kg\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the moment of inertia (I)\nI = mu_kg * R_m**2\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the rotational constant (B) in Joules\nB = h_bar**2 / (2 * I)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the two components of the transition energy\nE_vib_part = h_bar * w_rad_s  # Energy from the vibrational jump (ħω)\nE_rot_part = 2 * B            # Energy from the rotational jump (2B)\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the total energy of the absorbed photon (ΔE)\nDelta_E = E_vib_part + E_rot_part\n\n# Step 6: Calculate the photon's momentum (p)\np = Delta_E / c\n\nprint(f\"{p=}\")\n```\n<execute_code>\np=1.4095493026131464e-28\n</execute_code>\nThe calculation yields a momentum `p ≈ 1.41 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s`.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe calculated momentum `p ≈ 1.41 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s` is in excellent agreement with option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The reasoning and calculation performed in the previous step are correct.\n\n1.  **Identify Initial and Final States:**\n    *   The molecule starts in the ground state (fundamental state), which corresponds to the lowest vibrational and rotational quantum numbers: `v=0`, `J=0`.\n    *   The next state with the lowest possible energy that can be reached by absorbing a photon is governed by the selection rules `Δv=+1` and `ΔJ=+1` (since the initial `J` is 0, `ΔJ` cannot be -1).\n    *   Therefore, the final state is `v=1`, `J=1`.\n\n2.  **Calculate Energy Change:**\n    *   The energy of a state `(v, J)` is `E(v, J) = ħω(v + 1/2) + B*J(J + 1)`.\n    *   Energy of initial state: `E(0, 0) = (1/2)ħω`.\n    *   Energy of final state: `E(1, 1) = (3/2)ħω + B*1*(1+1) = (3/2)ħω + 2B`.\n    *   The energy of the absorbed photon is `ΔE = E(1, 1) - E(0, 0) = (ħω + 2B)`.\n\n3.  **Calculate Photon Momentum:**\n    *   The momentum of a photon is related to its energy by `p = ΔE / c`.\n    *   So, `p = (ħω + 2B) / c`.\n\n4.  **Numerical Calculation:**\n    *   The Python code correctly calculated all the intermediate values (reduced mass `μ`, moment of inertia `I`, rotational constant `B`) and then computed the final momentum `p`.\n    *   The result from the code execution is `p = 1.410... x 10⁻²⁸ N·s`.\n\n5.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   A) p = 1.9 * 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n    *   B) p = 1.1 * 10⁻²⁷ N·s\n    *   C) p = 2.3 * 10⁻²⁷ N·s\n    *   D) p = 1.4 * 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n\nThe calculated value of approximately `1.41 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s` matches option D most closely.\n\n<<<D>>>"
