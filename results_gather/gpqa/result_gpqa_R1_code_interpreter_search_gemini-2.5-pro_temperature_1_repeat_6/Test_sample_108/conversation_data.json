    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the non-permitted partial wave.\n\n### 1. Define the Initial State and Conservation Laws\n\n*   **Initial State (NN_i):** The system starts as two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state.\n    *   The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the quantum numbers.\n    *   `2S_i+1 = 1` => `S_i = 0` (total spin).\n    *   `L = S` => `L_i = 0` (orbital angular momentum).\n    *   `J = 0` => `J_i = 0` (total angular momentum).\n    *   The parity of the initial state is `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **Decay Process:** `NN_i -> NN_f + X`\n    *   The emitted particle `X` has intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`.\n    *   The orbital angular momentum of `X` relative to `NN_f` is denoted `L_X`. (s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3).\n\n*   **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J):**\n    *   The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state: `J_i = J_f`.\n    *   The final total angular momentum `J_f` is the vector sum of the `NN_f` system's total angular momentum (`J_NN`) and the orbital angular momentum of particle `X` (`L_X`): `J_f = J_NN + L_X`.\n    *   Since `J_i = 0`, we must have `J_f = 0`. For the vector sum to be zero, the magnitudes must be equal: `J_NN = L_X`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Parity (P):**\n    *   The total parity of the initial state must equal the total parity of the final state: `P_i = P_f`.\n    *   `P_i = +1`.\n    *   The final parity is the product of the parities of its components: `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X) * P(orbital)`.\n    *   `P(NN_f) = (-1)^L_NN`.\n    *   `P(X) = -1` (given).\n    *   `P(orbital) = (-1)^L_X`.\n    *   So, `P_f = (-1)^L_NN * (-1) * (-1)^L_X = -(-1)^(L_NN + L_X)`.\n    *   For parity to be conserved, `+1 = -(-1)^(L_NN + L_X)`, which means `(-1)^(L_NN + L_X) = -1`.\n    *   This implies that the sum `L_NN + L_X` must be an odd number.\n\n*   **Pauli Principle for the Final NN State (NN_f):**\n    *   The problem states that for the final `NN_f` state, `T(NN_f) = 0`.\n    *   It also provides the condition from the Pauli exclusion principle: `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   Substituting `T(NN_f) = 0`, we get `0 = S_NN + L_NN + 1 (mod 2)`.\n    *   This equation holds if and only if `S_NN + L_NN` is an odd number.\n\n### 2. Summary of Conditions for a Permitted Transition\n\nA transition is permitted only if all three of the following conditions are met:\n1.  **J-Conservation:** `J_NN = L_X`\n2.  **P-Conservation:** `L_NN + L_X` must be odd.\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** For `T_NN = 0`, `S_NN + L_NN` must be odd.\n\n### 3. Analysis of the Options\n\nLet's check each option against these three conditions.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   `NN_f` state (`7D1`): `2S_NN+1=7` -> `S_NN=3`. `L_NN=2` (D-state). `J_NN=1`.\n*   This state is impossible for a two-nucleon system. Nucleons are spin-1/2 particles, so their total spin can only be S=0 or S=1. S=3 is not possible. Therefore, this transition is not permitted.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   `NN_f` state (`3S1`): `S_NN=1`, `L_NN=0`, `J_NN=1`.\n*   Particle `X` (`p`): `L_X=1`.\n*   1. J-Cons: `J_NN = L_X`? `1 = 1`. (✓)\n*   2. P-Cons: `L_NN + L_X` odd? `0 + 1 = 1`. (✓)\n*   3. Pauli: `S_NN + L_NN` odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. (✓)\n*   All conditions are met. This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   `NN_f` state (`3P0`): `S_NN=1`, `L_NN=1`, `J_NN=0`.\n*   Particle `X` (`s`): `L_X=0`.\n*   1. J-Cons: `J_NN = L_X`? `0 = 0`. (✓)\n*   2. P-Cons: `L_NN + L_X` odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. (✓)\n*   3. Pauli: `S_NN + L_NN` odd? `1 + 1 = 2`. (**✗**)\n*   The Pauli principle condition is violated. This transition is **not permitted**.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   `NN_f` state (`3D3`): `S_NN=1`, `L_NN=2`, `J_NN=3`.\n*   Particle `X` (`f`): `L_X=3`.\n*   1. J-Cons: `J_NN = L_X`? `3 = 3`. (✓)\n*   2. P-Cons: `L_NN + L_X` odd? `2 + 3 = 5`. (✓)\n*   3. Pauli: `S_NN + L_NN` odd? `1 + 2 = 3`. (✓)\n*   All conditions are met. This transition is **permitted**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth options A and C describe non-permitted transitions. However, the reason for A (`S=3`) is that the final state is fundamentally impossible to construct with two nucleons. This is likely a typo in the question. The reason for C is a violation of the specific Pauli statistics rule that the question explicitly asks to be used. The state `3P0` itself is a valid state for two nucleons, but not if it has isospin `T=0`. The transition is forbidden because the final `(T=0, S=1, L=1)` state violates the Pauli principle. Given the explicit instruction in the problem, this is the intended violation to be found.\n\n<<<C>>>"
