    "*   **Analysis of the problem:** The user is trying to express a recombinant protein in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The protein should consist of an N-terminal influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag followed by the GADD45G protein. The experiment fails, and the protein is not expressed. The user provides the DNA sequence of the construct's coding strand. The task is to identify the reason for the failure from the given options.\n\n*   **Step 1: Analyze the provided DNA sequence.**\n    The sequence is the plus strand (coding strand), which will have the same sequence as the mRNA, but with Thymine (T) instead of Uracil (U). Translation starts at the first ATG codon and proceeds in triplets (codons).\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the key parts of the sequence.**\n    1.  **Start Codon:** The sequence begins with `ATG`, which is the standard start codon for Methionine.\n    2.  **HA Tag:** The HA tag sequence is YPYDVPDYA. Let's see if the DNA sequence corresponds to this.\n        *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n        *   `CCA` -> Proline (P)\n        *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n        *   `GAT` -> Aspartic acid (D)\n        *   `GTT` -> Valine (V)\n        *   `CCA` -> Proline (P)\n        *   `GAT` -> Aspartic acid (D)\n        *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n        *   `GCC` -> Alanine (A)\n        The translated sequence `YPYDVPDYA` is correct for the HA tag. So, there is no missense mutation in the tag. This rules out option B.\n\n*   **Step 3: Translate the sequence codon by codon from the start.**\n    Let's read the DNA sequence in codons from the beginning:\n    `ATG` (Start - Met)\n    `TAC` (Tyr) }\n    `CCA` (Pro) }\n    `TAC` (Tyr) }\n    `GAT` (Asp) } HA Tag\n    `GTT` (Val) }\n    `CCA` (Pro) }\n    `GAT` (Asp) }\n    `TAC` (Tyr) }\n    `GCC` (Ala) }\n    `AAA` (Lys)\n    `TGA` (Stop Codon)\n\n*   **Step 4: Identify the critical error.**\n    The codon `TGA` is one of the three standard stop codons (along with TAA and TAG). When the ribosome encounters this codon in the mRNA (as UGA), it terminates translation. This premature stop codon is located immediately after the sequence for the HA tag and a single lysine codon. Therefore, the ribosome will produce only a very short, non-functional peptide (Met-HA-Lys) and will not translate the rest of the sequence, which is supposed to be the GADD45G protein. This perfectly explains the observed failure to express the full-length protein.\n\n*   **Step 5: Evaluate the given options based on the finding.**\n    *   A) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse: The stop codon found is TGA (UGA in mRNA), not UAA. Furthermore, stop codons are recognized by release factors, not tRNAs. This option is incorrect.\n    *   B) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation: As determined in Step 2, the amino acid sequence for the HA tag is correct. This option is incorrect.\n    *   **C) The ribosome terminated the translation early:** This is exactly what the presence of the premature `TGA` stop codon would cause. This option is correct.\n    *   D) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain: While a linker can be beneficial, its absence does not guarantee proteolysis. More importantly, the protein is not being synthesized in the first place due to the stop codon, so proteolysis of the full-length protein cannot be the primary issue. This option is incorrect.\n\n<<<C>>>"
