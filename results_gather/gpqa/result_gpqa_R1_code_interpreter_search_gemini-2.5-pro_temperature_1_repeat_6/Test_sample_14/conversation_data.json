They have limited observing time and want to observe the one that has the highest probability of transiting. Both of these planets have already been detected via the RV method, allowing us to know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Although both planets share the same masses, the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2. Interestingly, they both have circular orbits. Furthermore, we know the masses and radii of the host stars of these two planets. The star hosting Planet_1 has a mass that is twice that of the host star of Planet_2. As the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved, both host stars have the same radii.

    "```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the transit probabilities (Prob_1 / Prob_2)\n# The formula derived is (4.5)^(1/3)\nratio = 4.5**(1/3)\nprint(f\"The ratio of Prob_1 to Prob_2 is: {ratio}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\nThe ratio of Prob_1 to Prob_2 is: 1.6509640014529813\n</execute_result>\nThe reasoning process to solve the problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to compare the transit probabilities of two exoplanets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, to decide which one is a better candidate for observation.\n\n2.  **Recall the Transit Probability Formula:** The geometric probability of a planet transiting its star is given by the ratio of the star's radius (`R_s`) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (`a`). For a circular orbit, this is:\n    `Prob = R_s / a`\n\n3.  **Use Kepler's Third Law:** The semi-major axis `a` is not directly given. However, it can be related to the orbital period (`P`) and the host star's mass (`M_s`) using Kepler's Third Law. For a planet with mass `M_p` much smaller than its star's mass (`M_p << M_s`), the law simplifies to:\n    `P² ∝ a³ / M_s`\n    Solving for `a`, we get:\n    `a³ ∝ M_s * P²`\n    `a ∝ (M_s * P²)^(1/3)`\n\n4.  **Derive the Proportionality for Transit Probability:** Substitute the expression for `a` from Step 3 into the probability formula from Step 2:\n    `Prob ∝ R_s / (M_s * P²)^(1/3)`\n    `Prob ∝ R_s * M_s^(-1/3) * P^(-2/3)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ratio of Probabilities:** We need to find the ratio of the probability of Planet_1 transiting (`Prob_1`) to the probability of Planet_2 transiting (`Prob_2`):\n    `Ratio = Prob_1 / Prob_2 = [R_s1 * M_s1^(-1/3) * P_1^(-2/3)] / [R_s2 * M_s2^(-1/3) * P_2^(-2/3)]`\n    This can be rearranged as:\n    `Ratio = (R_s1 / R_s2) * (M_s1 / M_s2)^(-1/3) * (P_1 / P_2)^(-2/3)`\n    `Ratio = (R_s1 / R_s2) * (M_s2 / M_s1)^(1/3) * (P_2 / P_1)^(2/3)`\n\n6.  **Substitute the Given Values:** Now, we plug in the relationships provided in the question:\n    *   The stars have the same radii: `R_s1 = R_s2` → `R_s1 / R_s2 = 1`\n    *   Star 1 is twice as massive as Star 2: `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2` → `M_s2 / M_s1 = 1/2`\n    *   Planet 1's period is three times shorter than Planet 2's: `P_1 = P_2 / 3` → `P_2 / P_1 = 3`\n\n    Substituting these into the ratio equation:\n    `Ratio = (1) * (1/2)^(1/3) * (3)^(2/3)`\n    `Ratio = (3² / 2)^(1/3)`\n    `Ratio = (9 / 2)^(1/3)`\n    `Ratio = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n\n7.  **Compute the Numerical Value:** The calculation `(4.5)^(1/3)` was performed and yielded approximately `1.65`.\n\n8.  **Interpret the Result:**\n    *   The ratio `Prob_1 / Prob_2` is `~1.65`.\n    *   Since the ratio is greater than 1, `Prob_1` is greater than `Prob_2`.\n    *   This means Planet_1 has a higher probability of transiting.\n    *   Specifically, Planet_1's transit probability is about 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2.\n    *   This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The geometric probability of a planet transiting its star is given by the ratio of the stellar radius to the planet's orbital semi-major axis, `Prob = R_s / a`.\n\nFrom Kepler's Third Law, we know that the square of the orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (`a`) and inversely proportional to the mass of the host star (`M_s`).\n`P² ∝ a³ / M_s`\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for the semi-major axis, `a`:\n`a³ ∝ P² * M_s`\n`a ∝ (P² * M_s)^(1/3)`\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for `a` back into the probability formula:\n`Prob ∝ R_s / (P² * M_s)^(1/3)`\n`Prob ∝ R_s * P^(-2/3) * M_s^(-1/3)`\n\nTo compare the probabilities of Planet_1 and Planet_2, we can set up a ratio:\n`Prob_1 / Prob_2 = [R_s1 * P_1^(-2/3) * M_s1^(-1/3)] / [R_s2 * P_2^(-2/3) * M_s2^(-1/3)]`\n\nWe can regroup the terms:\n`Prob_1 / Prob_2 = (R_s1 / R_s2) * (P_1 / P_2)^(-2/3) * (M_s1 / M_s2)^(-1/3)`\nThis is equivalent to:\n`Prob_1 / Prob_2 = (R_s1 / R_s2) * (P_2 / P_1)^(2/3) * (M_s2 / M_s1)^(1/3)`\n\nNow, let's plug in the information given in the problem:\n1.  Both host stars have the same radii: `R_s1 = R_s2`, so `R_s1 / R_s2 = 1`.\n2.  The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2: `P_1 = P_2 / 3`, so `P_2 / P_1 = 3`.\n3.  The star hosting Planet_1 has a mass twice that of the host star of Planet_2: `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2`, so `M_s2 / M_s1 = 1/2`.\n\nSubstituting these values into the ratio equation:\n`Prob_1 / Prob_2 = (1) * (3)^(2/3) * (1/2)^(1/3)`\n`Prob_1 / Prob_2 = (3²)^(1/3) * (1/2)^(1/3)`\n`Prob_1 / Prob_2 = (9)^(1/3) * (1/2)^(1/3)`\n`Prob_1 / Prob_2 = (9 * 1/2)^(1/3)`\n`Prob_1 / Prob_2 = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n\nThe calculated value is `(4.5)^(1/3) ≈ 1.65`.\n\nSince the ratio `Prob_1 / Prob_2` is approximately 1.65, this means the probability of Planet_1 transiting is about 1.65 times higher than the probability of Planet_2 transiting. Therefore, Planet_1 is the preferred target for observation.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
