    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:** The problem involves the concept of cosmological redshift. As the universe expands, the wavelength of light emitted from distant objects gets stretched. The amount of stretching is quantified by the redshift, 'z'. The formula that relates the observed wavelength (λ_observed) to the emitted or rest wavelength (λ_rest) is:\n    λ_observed = λ_rest * (1 + z)\n\n2.  **Identify the Key Information:**\n    *   The spectral line is the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) line of neutral hydrogen.\n    *   Its rest wavelength (λ_rest) is approximately 1216 Å (Angstroms). Note: 1 Å = 0.1 nm. So, 1216 Å = 121.6 nm. This is in the far-ultraviolet (UV) part of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n    *   The detection instrument is a ground-based optical telescope.\n\n3.  **Identify the Constraint:** The primary constraint for a ground-based telescope is the Earth's atmosphere. The atmosphere is opaque to most UV radiation, primarily due to the ozone layer. It only becomes transparent to light at wavelengths longer than a certain \"atmospheric cutoff\". This cutoff is not a sharp line but generally occurs in the near-UV, around 3200 Å to 3600 Å (320-360 nm), depending on the observatory's altitude and atmospheric conditions. For a photon to be detected by a ground-based telescope, its observed wavelength must be longer than this cutoff.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Problem:** We need to find the *lower limit* on the redshift (z) that would stretch the Lyα line's wavelength (1216 Å) just enough to pass through the atmosphere. This means we need to find the 'z' that corresponds to the observed wavelength being equal to the atmospheric cutoff wavelength.\n    *   Let's set up the equation: λ_cutoff = λ_rest * (1 + z_min)\n    *   We can rearrange this to solve for the minimum redshift, z_min:\n        z_min = (λ_cutoff / λ_rest) - 1\n\n5.  **Estimate the Cutoff and Calculate:** The exact atmospheric cutoff wavelength isn't provided, but it's a known physical constraint. A standard, representative value for the beginning of the atmospheric window is around 3500-3600 Å. Let's use the provided multiple-choice answers to see which one corresponds to a reasonable cutoff wavelength.\n\n    We can test the redshift given in option D, z = 1.9.\n    *   λ_observed = 1216 Å * (1 + 1.9)\n    *   λ_observed = 1216 Å * 2.9\n    *   λ_observed = 3526.4 Å\n\n    This value of ~3526 Å (or ~353 nm) is a very plausible value for the atmospheric cutoff wavelength. Let's check the other options:\n    *   A) z = 2.4 -> λ_observed = 1216 * 3.4 = 4134.4 Å. This is well within the observable range, so z=2.4 is possible, but it may not be the *lower limit*.\n    *   B) z = 3 -> λ_observed = 1216 * 4.0 = 4864 Å. Also observable, but clearly not the lower limit.\n    *   C) z = 1.2 -> λ_observed = 1216 * 2.2 = 2675.2 Å. This is deep in the UV and would be completely blocked by the atmosphere.\n\n    Since a redshift of 1.9 shifts the line to a wavelength that is just at the edge of atmospheric transparency, it represents the most realistic *lower limit* among the choices. Any redshift lower than this would likely be undetectable from the ground.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation using Python:** We can use a python script to confirm the calculation that links the redshift of 1.9 to a reasonable atmospheric cutoff wavelength.\n\n```python\n# Rest wavelength of Lyman-alpha line in Angstroms\nlambda_rest = 1216\n\n# Proposed redshift from option D\nz = 1.9\n\n# Calculate the observed wavelength using the redshift formula:\n# lambda_observed = lambda_rest * (1 + z)\nlambda_observed = lambda_rest * (1 + z)\n\nprint(f\"A redshift of z={z} shifts the Lyman-alpha line to an observed wavelength of {lambda_observed:.1f} Angstroms.\")\nprint(\"This wavelength is in the near-UV, just at the edge of the atmospheric window (~3500 Angstroms), making it a plausible lower limit for detection from the ground.\")\n\n```\nA redshift of z=1.9 shifts the Lyman-alpha line to an observed wavelength of 3526.4 Angstroms.\nThis wavelength is in the near-UV, just at the edge of the atmospheric window (~3500 Angstroms), making it a plausible lower limit for detection from the ground.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem requires us to find the minimum redshift (z) needed for the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) line of hydrogen to be detectable by a ground-based optical telescope.\n\n1.  **Identify the rest wavelength:** The Lyα line has a rest wavelength (λ_rest) of approximately 1216 Å. This is in the far-ultraviolet (UV) part of the spectrum.\n\n2.  **Identify the observational constraint:** Ground-based telescopes are limited by the Earth's atmosphere, which absorbs most radiation with wavelengths shorter than about 3500-3600 Å (the atmospheric cutoff). For the Lyα line to be detected, its wavelength must be redshifted to a value greater than this cutoff.\n\n3.  **Apply the redshift formula:** The relationship between the observed wavelength (λ_observed) and the rest wavelength (λ_rest) is given by:\n    λ_observed = λ_rest * (1 + z)\n\n4.  **Set up the condition for the lower limit:** To find the *lower limit* on the redshift, we need to find the 'z' that shifts the 1216 Å line to the minimum observable wavelength, which is the atmospheric cutoff (~3500 Å).\n    λ_observed ≈ 3500 Å\n\n5.  **Test the given options:** We can now calculate the observed wavelength for each of the proposed redshifts:\n\n    *   **A) z = 2.4:**\n        λ_observed = 1216 Å * (1 + 2.4) = 1216 Å * 3.4 = 4134.4 Å. This is observable, but perhaps not the lower limit.\n\n    *   **B) z = 3:**\n        λ_observed = 1216 Å * (1 + 3) = 1216 Å * 4.0 = 4864 Å. This is also observable.\n\n    *   **C) z = 1.2:**\n        λ_observed = 1216 Å * (1 + 1.2) = 1216 Å * 2.2 = 2675.2 Å. This wavelength is still in the UV and would be blocked by the atmosphere.\n\n    *   **D) z = 1.9:**\n        λ_observed = 1216 Å * (1 + 1.9) = 1216 Å * 2.9 = 3526.4 Å. This value is just above the atmospheric cutoff of ~3500 Å.\n\n**Conclusion:** A redshift of z = 1.9 shifts the Lyα line to a wavelength that is just at the edge of what can be detected from the ground. Any redshift lower than this would be undetectable. Therefore, z = 1.9 is the best estimate for the lower limit among the given choices.\n\n<<<D>>>"
