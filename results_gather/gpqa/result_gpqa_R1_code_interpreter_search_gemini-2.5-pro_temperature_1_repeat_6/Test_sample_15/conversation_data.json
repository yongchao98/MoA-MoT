    "A compound is optically active if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This is typically due to the presence of one or more chiral centers and the absence of any internal elements of symmetry (like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion). Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`. The molecule contains a double bond. All atoms connected to the double bond (Cl, H, C of CH3, C of CH2CH3) lie in the same plane. This plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the entire molecule. Molecules with a plane of symmetry are achiral.\n    *   **Result: Optically inactive.**\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name includes stereochemical descriptors (R, S, E). The \"(3aR,7aS)\" part indicates that there are chiral centers at positions 3a and 7a, and a specific spatial arrangement is defined. A compound for which a specific enantiomer (like R or S) is named is, by definition, chiral and optically active (unless it's a meso compound, which is not the case for this complex structure).\n    *   **Result: Optically active.**\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two chiral centers at C2 and C3. The descriptors are (2R, 3S). Let's examine its structure. This specific combination of R and S configurations results in a molecule with a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 bond. Such a compound, which has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to internal symmetry, is called a meso compound. Meso compounds are optically inactive.\n    *   **Result: Optically inactive.**\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the compound above. The stereochemistry is (2R, 3R). This molecule does not possess a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is chiral, and its mirror image is the (2S, 3S) enantiomer. As a chiral molecule, it is optically active.\n    *   **Result: Optically active.**\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond and a hydroxyl group. The carbon atom C1, bonded to the -OH group, is a chiral center. It is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, -CH=CH- (part of the ring), and -CH2-CH2- (the other part of the ring). The name specifies the (R) enantiomer. A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral.\n    *   **Result: Optically active.**\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: The 's' notation, in this context, usually implies a 'cis' relationship between the substituents. So, this is the all-cis isomer, with all three hydroxyl groups on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. If you consider the more stable chair conformation where all three -OH groups are equatorial, the molecule has three planes of symmetry. Each plane passes through one C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Result: Optically inactive.**\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-(cyclopentyl ring)`. We need to check for any chiral centers.\n    *   Carbonyl carbon: bonded to three things (O, cyclopentyl, -CH2-). Not chiral.\n    *   -CH2- group: bonded to two identical H atoms. Not chiral.\n    *   -CH(CH3)2 group: The central carbon is bonded to H and two identical -CH3 groups. Not chiral.\n    *   Cyclopentyl ring: All carbons are -CH2- groups (symmetrically substituted). No chiral centers.\n    Since the molecule has no chiral centers and no other elements of chirality (like axial or planar chirality), it is achiral.\n    *   **Result: Optically inactive.**\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe optically active compounds are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<A>>>"
