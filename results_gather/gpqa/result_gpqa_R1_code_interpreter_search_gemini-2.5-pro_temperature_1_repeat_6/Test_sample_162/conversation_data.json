    "This problem requires a two-part calculation: first, the stoichiometric calculation for the volume of acid needed to dissolve the precipitate, and second, an equilibrium calculation to determine the pH of the resulting solution.\n\n**Part 1: Calculating the minimum volume of acid**\n\n1.  **Write the chemical equation for the dissolution:**\n    Iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)3, is a basic salt that dissolves in acid. The reaction with a strong monobasic acid (like HCl, which provides H+ ions) is a neutralization reaction:\n    Fe(OH)3(s) + 3H+(aq) -> Fe3+(aq) + 3H2O(l)\n\n2.  **Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3:**\n    *   Mass of Fe(OH)3 = 0.1 g\n    *   Molar mass of Fe(OH)3 = M(Fe) + 3 * (M(O) + M(H))\n        Using molar masses: Fe ≈ 55.845 g/mol, O ≈ 16.00 g/mol, H ≈ 1.01 g/mol.\n        Molar mass of Fe(OH)3 ≈ 55.845 + 3 * (16.00 + 1.01) = 106.875 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Fe(OH)3 = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.875 g/mol ≈ 0.00093567 mol.\n\n3.  **Calculate the moles of H+ required:**\n    From the stoichiometry of the reaction, 1 mole of Fe(OH)3 reacts with 3 moles of H+.\n    *   Moles of H+ = 3 * Moles of Fe(OH)3 = 3 * 0.00093567 mol ≈ 0.002807 mol.\n\n4.  **Calculate the volume of the 0.1 M acid:**\n    The problem asks for the *minimum* volume, which means we add just enough acid to react completely with the Fe(OH)3.\n    *   Concentration of acid (C) = 0.1 M = 0.1 mol/L.\n    *   Volume (V) = Moles / Concentration = 0.002807 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02807 L.\n    *   Convert the volume to cm³: V = 0.02807 L * 1000 cm³/L = 28.07 cm³.\n\nThis calculated volume (28.07 cm³) is very close to the 28.05 cm³ given in option B. The minor difference is due to the rounding of molar masses used.\n\n**Part 2: Calculating the pH of the resulting solution**\n\n1.  **Identify the species determining the pH:**\n    After the Fe(OH)3 is dissolved, the solution contains Fe3+ ions, the anion from the strong acid (which is a spectator ion), and water. The total volume is 100 cm³ (0.1 L). The Fe3+ ion is a small, highly charged metal ion that hydrolyzes in water, producing H+ ions and making the solution acidic.\n\n2.  **Write the hydrolysis equation:**\n    The hydrated iron(III) ion acts as a weak acid:\n    [Fe(H2O)6]3+(aq) + H2O(l) <=> [Fe(H2O)5(OH)]2+(aq) + H3O+(aq)\n    For simplicity: Fe3+(aq) + H2O(l) <=> Fe(OH)2+(aq) + H+(aq)\n    The acid dissociation constant (Ka) for this reaction at 25°C is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻³.\n\n3.  **Calculate the initial concentration of Fe3+:**\n    *   Moles of Fe3+ = Moles of Fe(OH)3 ≈ 0.0009357 mol.\n    *   Total volume = 100 cm³ = 0.1 L.\n    *   Initial [Fe3+] = Moles / Volume = 0.0009357 mol / 0.1 L = 0.009357 M.\n\n4.  **Set up an ICE table and solve for [H+]**:\n    Let x be the change in concentration.\n| Reaction | Fe3+(aq) | Fe(OH)2+(aq) | H+(aq) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **I**nitial | 0.009357 | 0 | 0 |\n| **C**hange | -x | +x | +x |\n| **E**quilibrium| 0.009357 - x| x | x |\n\n    Ka = [Fe(OH)2+][H+] / [Fe3+]\n    6.3 x 10⁻³ = (x)(x) / (0.009357 - x)\n    x² = 6.3 x 10⁻³ * (0.009357 - x)\n    x² + (6.3 x 10⁻³)x - 5.895 x 10⁻⁵ = 0\n\n    Solving this quadratic equation for x (where x = [H+]) gives:\n    x ≈ 0.00515 M.\n\n5.  **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   pH = -log10([H+]) = -log10(0.00515) ≈ 2.29.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Our calculated volume of acid is **28.07 cm³**, which matches option B (28.05 cm³) almost perfectly.\n*   Our calculated pH is **2.29**. This does not match the pH in option B (2.04).\n\nThe discrepancy in pH is likely due to an error in the problem's provided options. However, the stoichiometric calculation for the volume is straightforward and less prone to variations from different data sources (like Ka values). Given the excellent match for the volume, option B is the most plausible intended answer.\n\nLet's run a final check with the provided values.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Part 1: Volume Calculation\nmass_FeOH3 = 0.1  # g\nmolar_mass_FeOH3 = 55.845 + 3 * (15.999 + 1.008)  # g/mol\nacid_conc = 0.1  # M or mol/L\n\nmoles_FeOH3 = mass_FeOH3 / molar_mass_FeOH3\nmoles_H_needed = 3 * moles_FeOH3\nvolume_acid_L = moles_H_needed / acid_conc\nvolume_acid_cm3 = volume_acid_L * 1000\n\n# Part 2: pH Calculation\ntotal_volume_L = 100 / 1000  # L\ninitial_conc_Fe3 = moles_FeOH3 / total_volume_L\nKa_Fe3 = 6.3e-3\n\n# Solve quadratic equation: x^2 + Ka*x - Ka*C = 0\n# x = [-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a\na = 1\nb = Ka_Fe3\nc = -Ka_Fe3 * initial_conc_Fe3\n\nx_H_ion = (-b + math.sqrt(b**2 - 4*a*c)) / (2*a)\npH = -math.log10(x_H_ion)\n\nprint(f\"Calculated Volume (cm3): {volume_acid_cm3:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"Calculated pH: {pH:.2f}\")\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem involves two main steps:\n1.  A stoichiometric calculation to find the volume of acid required to dissolve the iron(III) hydroxide.\n2.  An equilibrium calculation to find the pH of the resulting solution, which will be acidic due to the hydrolysis of the Fe³⁺ ion.\n\n**Part 1: Stoichiometric Calculation for the Volume of Acid**\n\nFirst, we write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction between iron(III) hydroxide, a base, and a strong monobasic acid (represented by H⁺):\n\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nThis equation shows that 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ reacts with 3 moles of H⁺ ions.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of moles of Fe(OH)₃ we need to dissolve.\n*   Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g\n*   Molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ = (Molar mass of Fe) + 3 × (Molar mass of O + Molar mass of H)\n    = 55.845 g/mol + 3 × (15.999 g/mol + 1.008 g/mol) = 106.869 g/mol\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.869 g/mol = 0.0009357 mol\n\nUsing the stoichiometry from the balanced equation, we find the moles of H⁺ required:\n*   Moles of H⁺ = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 × 0.0009357 mol = 0.002807 mol\n\nFinally, we calculate the volume of the 0.1 M acid needed to provide this amount of H⁺. The problem asks for the *minimum* volume, which corresponds to this exact stoichiometric amount.\n*   Concentration of acid = 0.1 M = 0.1 mol/L\n*   Volume = Moles / Concentration = 0.002807 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02807 L\n*   To convert the volume to cm³, we multiply by 1000:\n    Volume = 0.02807 L × 1000 cm³/L = 28.07 cm³\n\nThis calculated volume (28.07 cm³) is extremely close to the value of 28.05 cm³ given in option B.\n\n**Part 2: Equilibrium Calculation for the pH**\n\nAfter the Fe(OH)₃ dissolves, the solution contains Fe³⁺ ions in a total volume of 100 cm³ (0.1 L). The Fe³⁺ ion is a small, highly charged metal ion that hydrolyzes in water, acting as a weak acid and lowering the pH.\n\nThe hydrolysis reaction is:\nFe³⁺(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ Fe(OH)²⁺(aq) + H⁺(aq)\n\nThe acid dissociation constant (Ka) for this reaction at 25°C is approximately Ka = 6.3 × 10⁻³.\n\nFirst, we calculate the initial concentration of Fe³⁺ in the solution:\n*   [Fe³⁺]initial = Moles of Fe³⁺ / Total Volume = 0.0009357 mol / 0.1 L = 0.009357 M\n\nNow, we use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to find the equilibrium concentration of H⁺. Let 'x' be the concentration of H⁺ produced at equilibrium.\n\n|                | Fe³⁺(aq)     | Fe(OH)²⁺(aq) | H⁺(aq) |\n| :------------- | :----------- | :----------- | :----- |\n| **Initial**    | 0.009357 M   | 0            | 0      |\n| **Change**     | -x           | +x           | +x     |\n| **Equilibrium**| 0.009357 - x | x            | x      |\n\nNow, we use the Ka expression:\nKa = [Fe(OH)²⁺][H⁺] / [Fe³⁺]\n6.3 × 10⁻³ = (x)(x) / (0.009357 - x)\n\nThis rearranges to the quadratic equation:\nx² + (6.3 × 10⁻³)x - (5.895 × 10⁻⁵) = 0\n\nSolving this equation for x (which represents [H⁺]) gives:\nx = [H⁺] ≈ 0.00515 M\n\nFinally, we calculate the pH:\npH = -log₁₀([H⁺]) = -log₁₀(0.00515) ≈ 2.29\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Our calculated volume is **28.07 cm³**, which matches the volume in option B (28.05 cm³) very well.\n*   Our calculated pH is **2.29**, which differs from the pH in option B (2.04).\n\nThe discrepancy in pH is likely due to an error in the pH value provided in the question's options. However, the stoichiometric calculation for the volume is straightforward and robust. Given the excellent match for the volume, option B is the most plausible choice.\n\n<<<B>>>"
