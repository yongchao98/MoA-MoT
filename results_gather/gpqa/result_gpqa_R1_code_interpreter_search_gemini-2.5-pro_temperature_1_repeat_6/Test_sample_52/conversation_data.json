    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Structure:** The problem states the compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This means we have a benzene ring (C6H6) where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by two substituent groups. The core of the molecule is therefore a C6H4 group.\n\n2.  **Interpret the 1H NMR Data for the Aromatic Ring:** The 1H NMR spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\". In a di-substituted benzene ring, having only two signals for the four aromatic protons is a strong indication of a symmetrical substitution pattern. Specifically, this points to **1,4- (para) substitution**. In a para-substituted ring, the four protons are chemically equivalent in two sets of two, leading to two signals (typically two doublets). So, we have a C6H4 core.\n\n3.  **Identify the First Substituent from NMR Data:** The spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\". This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)** attached to the ring.\n    *   Let's label the protons: `Ring-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3`.\n    *   The signal for proton H(b) is split by the adjacent vinyl proton H(a) into a **doublet**, and it's also split by the three protons of the -CH3 group into a **quartet**. This results in a **doublet of quartets**.\n    *   The signal for proton H(a) is split only by the adjacent vinyl proton H(b), resulting in a **doublet**.\n    *   This perfectly matches the description. This propenyl group has the formula **-C3H5**. It also accounts for one of the two -CH3 signals mentioned.\n\n4.  **Identify the Second Substituent from FTIR and NMR Data:**\n    *   The FTIR spectrum shows an **ester group (-COO-)**.\n    *   The 1H NMR spectrum shows a second **-CH3 signal** and, crucially, **no signals corresponding to -CH2 groups**.\n    *   We need to form a substituent that contains an ester group and a methyl group, but no methylene (-CH2-) groups. There are two possibilities for this substituent, which is attached to the C6H4 ring:\n        *   A methyl ester group: **-COOCH3**. This fragment contains the ester, a -CH3 group, and no -CH2 groups.\n        *   An acetoxy group: **-OCOCH3**. This fragment also contains the ester, a -CH3 group, and no -CH2 groups.\n    *   Both of these possible groups have the same chemical formula: **-C2H3O2**.\n\n5.  **Assemble the Molecular Formula:** Now we can sum the atoms from all the identified parts of the molecule to find the total chemical formula.\n    *   **From the para-substituted ring:** C6H4\n    *   **From the propenyl group:** C3H5\n    *   **From the ester-containing group:** C2H3O2\n\n    Let's add them up:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 0 + 0 + 2 = **2**\n\n    The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:** The calculated formula, C11H12O2, matches option A.\n\nLet's perform a final check using the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for C11H12O2:\n*   DoU = C + 1 - H/2 = 11 + 1 - 12/2 = 12 - 6 = 6.\nOur proposed structure contains:\n*   1 benzene ring (4 degrees of unsaturation)\n*   1 C=C double bond in the propenyl group (1 degree of unsaturation)\n*   1 C=O double bond in the ester group (1 degree of unsaturation)\n*   Total DoU = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\nThe calculated DoU matches the structure, confirming our analysis.\n\n<<<A>>>"
