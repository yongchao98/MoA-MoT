    "This problem can be solved using the method of images. The electric field outside the grounded conducting sphere due to the induced charges is identical to the field that would be produced by an \"image charge\" placed at a specific location inside the sphere. The combination of the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must make the potential on the spherical surface `r=R` equal to zero.\n\n### 1. Finding the Image Charge and its Position\n\nLet the center of the sphere be the origin. The charge `q` is placed at a distance `d` from the center along an axis (let's say the x-axis), so its position is `x=d`.\nThe image charge, let's call it `q'`, is placed at a position `b` along the same axis. We need to find the values of `q'` and `b` such that the potential on the surface of the sphere (at radius `R`) is zero.\n\nThe potential `V` at any point on the surface of the sphere is the sum of the potentials from the charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.\nLet a point P on the surface of the sphere be at a distance `r_1` from `q` and `r_2` from `q'`.\nThe potential at P is `V(P) = k*q/r_1 + k*q'/r_2 = 0`.\n\nThrough geometric analysis, it can be shown that this condition is satisfied for all points on the sphere if the image charge `q'` has a magnitude and position given by:\n*   **Position of image charge:** `b = R^2 / d`\n*   **Magnitude of image charge:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n\nThe image charge `q'` is located inside the sphere (since `d > R`, it follows that `b < R`), and it has the opposite sign to `q`.\n\n### 2. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to the position `d` in the presence of the grounded sphere. The force on the charge `q` at any position `x` (where `x>R`) is due to the induced charges on the sphere. By the method of images, this force is equal to the force exerted by the image charge `q'` on `q`.\n\nAn alternative, and simpler, method is to calculate the interaction energy of the system. The potential energy `U` of a configuration of charges is given by `U = (1/2) Σ q_i V_i`, where `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` due to all *other* charges in the system.\n\nOur system consists of the point charge `q` and the induced surface charge `σ` on the sphere.\n`U = (1/2) * [ q * V_induced_at_q + ∫(σ * V_sphere) dS ]`\n\n*   `V_sphere` is the potential on the surface of the sphere. Since the sphere is grounded, `V_sphere = 0`. Thus, the integral term is zero.\n*   `V_induced_at_q` is the potential at the location of charge `q` (at distance `d`) created by the induced charges on the sphere.\n\nThe potential `V_induced_at_q` is equivalent to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of `q`.\n\n1.  **Calculate the potential at `d` due to the image charge `q'`.**\n    *   The image charge `q' = -qR/d` is at `b = R^2/d`.\n    *   The charge `q` is at `d`.\n    *   The distance between `q` and `q'` is `distance = d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`.\n    *   The potential at `d` due to `q'` is:\n        `V_induced_at_q = k * q' / (distance)`\n        `V_induced_at_q = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n        `V_induced_at_q = - k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n2.  **Calculate the total potential energy `U`.**\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced_at_q`\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * [ -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n    *   `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThis expression represents the net potential energy of the system. The negative sign indicates that the force between the charge and the grounded sphere is attractive.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\nB) `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * d / (d^2 + R^2)`\nC) `U = - kq^2 * d / (d^2 - R^2)`\nD) `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * R^2 / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nOur derived formula matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
