    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(OCH₃)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule has one stereocenter at carbon C5, and its configuration is specified as (S). It is a chiral molecule.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols. The acidic workup protonates the resulting alkoxide.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone at C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group (-OH). This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** The starting material is chiral ((S) at C5). The reduction of the carbonyl at C3 can occur from two different faces, leading to two possible configurations at the new stereocenter (R or S).\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:** These two products have the same connectivity but differ in the configuration at one (but not all) of their stereocenters. Therefore, they are **diastereomers**. Since the starting material is chiral, the transition states leading to the two products are diastereomeric, meaning the two products will likely be formed in unequal amounts (diastereoselective reaction), but both will be present in the product mixture.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone).\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral and has no stereocenters.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to alcohols. The acidic workup provides the protons.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketones at C2 and C4 are reduced to hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   Product structure: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n*   **Products and Stereochemistry:** The reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. The maximum number of stereoisomers is 2ⁿ = 2² = 4. Let's analyze the possibilities:\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S): These two are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, so they are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since they are formed from an achiral starting material using an achiral reagent, they will be produced in a 1:1 ratio, forming a racemic mixture.\n    *   (2R, 4S): This stereoisomer possesses an internal plane of symmetry (when drawn in the correct conformation). A molecule with stereocenters that is achiral overall is called a **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration describes the same meso compound.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomers are formed: one meso compound and a racemic pair of enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC (an achiral technique) separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   It **can** separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers because they have different physical properties.\n    *   It **cannot** separate enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They will elute together as a single peak.\n*   **Applying to the mixture:**\n    1.  **Products from Reaction I:** We have two diastereomers, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Since they are diastereomers, they have different physical properties and will be separated by normal-phase HPLC. This will result in **2 peaks**.\n    2.  **Products from Reaction II:** We have a meso compound and a pair of enantiomers. The meso compound ((2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) is a diastereomer of the enantiomers ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol). Therefore, the meso compound will be separated from the enantiomeric pair. The two enantiomers will co-elute as a single peak. This will result in **2 peaks**.\n    3.  **Overall:** The products of Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) are structurally distinct from the products of Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) and will have different retention times. There is no risk of accidental co-elution between the products of the two reactions.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 peaks (from Reaction I) + 2 peaks (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. This allows for the separation of enantiomers, in addition to diastereomers and constitutional isomers. The chiral stationary phase interacts differently with each stereoisomer, leading to different retention times.\n*   **Applying to the mixture:**\n    *   The mixture contains a total of five unique stereoisomers:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        3.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n        4.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        5.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   A chiral column is designed to resolve all such stereoisomers. Each of these five compounds will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase and will therefore be separated.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** Each of the 5 stereoisomers will produce a distinct peak. Total = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 5: Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nB) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC\nC) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nD) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\n\nThe calculated result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
