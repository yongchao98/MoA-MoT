    "This is a classic particle physics problem involving a two-body decay from rest. We will use the principles of conservation of energy and momentum to solve it.\n\n**1. Understand the decay process:**\nThe reaction is a positive pion ($\\pi^+$) decaying into a positive muon ($\\mu^+$) and a muon neutrino ($\\nu_\\mu$).\n$\\pi^+ \\rightarrow \\mu^+ + \\nu_\\mu$\n\n**2. List the given information:**\n*   Initial particle $\\pi^+$ is stationary.\n*   Rest mass energy of $\\pi^+$, $m_{\\pi}c^2 = 139.6 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   Rest mass energy of $\\mu^+$, $m_{\\mu}c^2 = 105.7 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   Neutrinos are treated as massless, so the rest mass energy of $\\nu_\\mu$, $m_{\\nu}c^2 = 0$.\n\n**3. Apply Conservation Laws:**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    Since the initial pion is at rest, its momentum is zero. By conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero.\n    $\\vec{p}_{\\pi} = \\vec{p}_{\\mu} + \\vec{p}_{\\nu} = 0$\n    This implies that the muon and the neutrino must travel in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n    $|\\vec{p}_{\\mu}| = |\\vec{p}_{\\nu}| = p$\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:**\n    The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n    $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    Since the pion is at rest, its total energy is just its rest mass energy.\n    $E_{initial} = m_{\\pi}c^2$\n    The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n    $E_{final} = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$\n    So, $m_{\\pi}c^2 = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$\n\n**4. Use the Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\nThe total energy $E$ of a particle is related to its momentum $p$ and rest mass $m$ by the equation:\n$E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2$\n\n*   For the muon ($\\mu^+$):\n    $E_{\\mu}^2 = (p c)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n*   For the massless neutrino ($\\nu_\\mu$):\n    $E_{\\nu}^2 = (p c)^2 + (0)^2 \\implies E_{\\nu} = pc$\n\n**5. Solve for the Energies:**\nWe can now solve the system of equations.\nFrom energy conservation, we have $E_{\\mu} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - E_{\\nu}$.\nSubstitute $pc = E_{\\nu}$ into the muon's energy equation:\n$E_{\\mu}^2 = E_{\\nu}^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\nNow substitute the expression for $E_{\\mu}$:\n$(m_{\\pi}c^2 - E_{\\nu})^2 = E_{\\nu}^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\nExpand the left side:\n$(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)E_{\\nu} + E_{\\nu}^2 = E_{\\nu}^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\nThe $E_{\\nu}^2$ terms cancel out. Rearrange to solve for $E_{\\nu}$:\n$2(m_{\\pi}c^2)E_{\\nu} = (m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n$E_{\\nu} = \\frac{(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}{2m_{\\pi}c^2}$\n\nSince the neutrino is massless, its kinetic energy is equal to its total energy: $KE_{\\nu} = E_{\\nu}$.\n\nNow we can find the total energy of the muon, $E_{\\mu}$:\n$E_{\\mu} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - E_{\\nu}$\n$E_{\\mu} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - \\frac{(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}{2m_{\\pi}c^2}$\n$E_{\\mu} = \\frac{2(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - ((m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2)}{2m_{\\pi}c^2}$\n$E_{\\mu} = \\frac{(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}{2m_{\\pi}c^2}$\n\nThe kinetic energy of the muon is its total energy minus its rest mass energy:\n$KE_{\\mu} = E_{\\mu} - m_{\\mu}c^2$\n\n**6. Calculation:**\nLet's use a Python script to perform the calculations accurately.\n```python\n# Given rest mass energies in MeV\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7\n\n# Calculate the total energy of the muon (E_mu)\nE_mu = (m_pi_c2**2 + m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# Calculate the kinetic energy of the muon (KE_mu)\nKE_mu = E_mu - m_mu_c2\n\n# Calculate the total energy of the neutrino (E_nu)\n# From conservation of energy: E_nu = m_pi_c2 - E_mu\nE_nu = m_pi_c2 - E_mu\n\n# For a massless neutrino, its kinetic energy is its total energy\nKE_nu = E_nu\n\n# Print the results rounded to two decimal places\nprint(f\"KE of muon (mu+): {KE_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"KE of neutrino (nu): {KE_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\n<execute_output>\nKE of muon (mu+): 4.12 MeV\nKE of neutrino (nu): 29.78 MeV\n</execute_output>\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV (rounding 29.78) for the neutrino.\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\nA) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nB) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nC) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\nD) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
