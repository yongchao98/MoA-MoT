    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z.**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in a hydrocarbon CₓHᵧ is given by (y × Ar(H)) / (x × Ar(C) + y × Ar(H)), where Ar are the atomic weights.\n    *   Let's use approximate atomic weights for simplicity: Ar(H) ≈ 1 and Ar(C) ≈ 12.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%, which is very close to 1/7 (1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857).\n    *   So, we have the equation: y / (12x + y) = 1/7.\n    *   Rearranging this gives: 7y = 12x + y, which simplifies to 6y = 12x, or y = 2x.\n    *   This means the empirical formula of Z is CH₂, and the general formula is CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a saturated hydrocarbon. A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ that is saturated must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   We are also told that Z is widely used as a solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent that fits this description is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This is a very strong candidate for Z.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y.**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n    *   One of the components of Y is Z, which we've identified as cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). Let's call the other component B. So, Y = {Cyclohexane, B}.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means the hydrogenation of B must also yield cyclohexane.\n    *   This implies that B must also have a six-carbon skeleton.\n    *   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water. Cyclohexane is saturated and does not react. For B not to react with bromine water, it must either be saturated or aromatic (aromatic compounds like benzene do not react with bromine water without a catalyst).\n    *   Since B can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane, it cannot be saturated. Therefore, B must be an aromatic compound.\n    *   The aromatic compound with a six-carbon skeleton that hydrogenates to cyclohexane is **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n    *   So, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)** and **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction from Mixture X to Mixture Y.**\n    *   Mixture X, an equimolar mixture of two liquids (let's call them C and D), is heated with platinum to form mixture Y.\n    *   The reaction is described as a disproportionation. In this context, it's a hydrogen transfer reaction where one species is hydrogenated and another is dehydrogenated.\n    *   The reaction is: C + D → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆).\n    *   Since X is equimolar and Y is equimolar, the stoichiometry is 1:1 → 1:1.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This confirms that both C and D must have a six-carbon skeleton, just like benzene and cyclohexane.\n    *   Let the formula for C be C₆Hₓ and for D be C₆Hᵧ.\n    *   The reaction is: C₆Hₓ + C₆Hᵧ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆.\n    *   By the law of conservation of mass, the number of hydrogen atoms must be equal on both sides of the equation.\n    *   Therefore, x + y = 12 + 6 = 18.\n\n4.  **Determine the Final Answer.**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This corresponds to the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of C (C₆Hₓ) and one molecule of D (C₆Hᵧ).\n    *   This sum is x + y.\n    *   From our analysis in step 3, we found that x + y = 18.\n\n5.  **Consistency Check.**\n    *   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, meaning components C and D must contain C=C double bonds (i.e., they are unsaturated). This is consistent with x < 12 and y < 12.\n    *   The problem states there are no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   A possible identity for mixture X could be cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n    *   In this case, x = 10 and y = 8. The sum x + y = 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   Cyclohexene has one double bond. 1,4-cyclohexadiene has two non-conjugated double bonds. Both would decolorize bromine water.\n    *   The reaction C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆ is a plausible hydrogen transfer, where cyclohexene is hydrogenated and 1,4-cyclohexadiene is dehydrogenated.\n    *   This confirms that our deduced value is consistent with the existence of such molecules.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<A>>>"
