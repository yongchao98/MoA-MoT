    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula**\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU indicates the total number of rings and pi bonds in the molecule.\n    *   The formula is DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 1 ring and 3 double bonds, totaling 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional pi bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is the characteristic signature of a primary amine (-NH₂). One band corresponds to the symmetric N-H stretch, and the other to the asymmetric N-H stretch.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl region. The frequency is typical for an ester C=O group. A standard alkyl ester is around 1735-1750 cm⁻¹, but when the ester is conjugated with an aromatic ring, the frequency is lowered, making 1720 cm⁻¹ a very plausible value. This is too high for a typical amide (~1650 cm⁻¹).\n\n*   **IR Summary:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH₂) and a conjugated ester group (-COO-R).\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   This combination of a triplet (t) for 3 protons and a quartet (q) for 2 protons is the classic pattern for an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   The methyl group (-CH₃) at 1.20 ppm is split into a triplet by its two neighbors on the CH₂ group.\n    *   The methylene group (-CH₂) at 4.5 ppm is split into a quartet by its three neighbors on the CH₃ group. Its downfield chemical shift (~4.5 ppm) indicates it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, which in this context is the oxygen of the ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   This is a broad singlet (bs) that integrates to two protons. The broadness and chemical shift are characteristic of the two protons of the primary amine (-NH₂) identified from the IR spectrum. These protons are often broad due to exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8 ppm).\n    *   The pattern of two doublets (d), each integrating to 2 protons, is the classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   The doublet at 8.0 ppm is significantly downfield, indicating these protons are adjacent (ortho) to a strong electron-withdrawing group (the ester, -COOEt).\n    *   The doublet at 7.0 ppm is further upfield, indicating these protons are adjacent (ortho) to an electron-donating group (the amine, -NH₂).\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure and Evaluate Options**\n\nBased on the analysis, we have the following structural fragments:\n*   An ethyl group attached to an ester oxygen: -COOCH₂CH₃\n*   A primary amine group: -NH₂\n*   A 1,4-(para) disubstituted benzene ring.\n\nPutting these pieces together, the only possible structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's verify this against the given options:\n\n*   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer, but the ethyl group is part of a propionate (CH₃CH₂COO-). The -CH₂- group would be next to the C=O, not the oxygen, and its signal would be around 2.3 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. **Incorrect.**\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** The structure is H₂N-C₆H₄-COOCH₂CH₃. This perfectly matches all the IR and NMR data. The formula C₉H₁₁NO₂ is also correct. **Correct.**\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This has a meta-substitution pattern, which would not give two doublets in the NMR. Also, it's an amide, which is inconsistent with the IR C=O stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹. **Incorrect.**\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide (-NH-), which would show only one N-H peak in the IR and integrate to 1H in the NMR. It would also have a signal for the formyl proton (H-C=O) around 8-9 ppm. **Incorrect.**\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly points to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>"
