    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (M_total_1) to the total mass of system_2 (M_total_2).\n\n2.  **Recall the Relevant Physics:** For a double-lined spectroscopic binary system, the total mass (M_total = m1 + m2) is related to the orbital period (P) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities (K1 and K2) by the following formula:\n    M_total = (P / (2 * π * G)) * ( (K1 + K2)^3 / sin^3(i) )\n    where:\n    *   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n    *   `i` is the inclination of the orbital plane to the line of sight.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Formula:** From this formula, we can see the proportionality relationship:\n    M_total ∝ P * (K1 + K2)^3 / sin^3(i)\n\n4.  **Use Given Information:**\n    *   The problem states that both systems exhibit eclipses. This is a crucial piece of information. An eclipse can only happen if the orbital inclination `i` is very close to 90 degrees.\n    *   When `i` ≈ 90°, sin(i) ≈ 1, and therefore sin^3(i) ≈ 1.\n    *   Since we are comparing two eclipsing systems, we can assume sin^3(i) is the same (and equal to 1) for both and it will cancel out in the ratio.\n    *   Therefore, the proportionality simplifies to:\n        M_total ∝ P * (K1 + K2)^3\n\n5.  **Gather Data for Each System:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Period (P1) = 2 years\n        *   Velocity amplitudes (K1a, K1b) = 10 km/s, 5 km/s\n        *   Sum of amplitudes (K_sum1) = 10 + 5 = 15 km/s\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Period (P2) = 1 year\n        *   Velocity amplitudes (K2a, K2b) = 15 km/s, 10 km/s\n        *   Sum of amplitudes (K_sum2) = 15 + 10 = 25 km/s\n\n6.  **Set up the Ratio:** We want to find the ratio M_total_1 / M_total_2. Using the proportionality:\n    Ratio = (P1 * (K_sum1)^3) / (P2 * (K_sum2)^3)\n\n7.  **Calculate the Ratio:** Substitute the values into the equation. Note that as long as the units are consistent (years for period, km/s for velocity), they will cancel out.\n    Ratio = (2 * (15)^3) / (1 * (25)^3)\n    Ratio = 2 * (15 / 25)^3\n    Ratio = 2 * (3 / 5)^3\n    Ratio = 2 * (27 / 125)\n    Ratio = 54 / 125\n\n8.  **Compute the Final Value:** To compare with the options, convert the fraction to a decimal.\n    Ratio = 54 / 125 = 0.432\n\nThis calculation can be confirmed using a simple Python script.\n```python\n# Data for System 1\nP1 = 2  # years\nK1_sum = 10 + 5  # km/s\n\n# Data for System 2\nP2 = 1  # year\nK2_sum = 15 + 10  # km/s\n\n# The total mass is proportional to P * (K_sum)^3\n# We calculate the ratio of the masses\n# (Proportionality constant cancels out)\nratio = (P1 * (K1_sum)**3) / (P2 * (K2_sum)**3)\n\nprint(ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.432\n</execute_result>\n\n9.  **Conclusion:** The calculated ratio is 0.432. Comparing this to the given options:\n    A) ~ 0.4\n    B) ~ 0.6\n    C) ~ 0.7\n    D) ~ 1.2\nThe value 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem asks for the ratio of the total mass of system_1 to the total mass of system_2.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics**\n\nFor a double-lined spectroscopic binary star system, the total mass of the system (M_total = m1 + m2) can be determined using the orbital period (P) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocity curves of the two stars (K1 and K2). The formula is:\n\nM_total = M1 + M2 = (P / (2 * π * G)) * ( (K1 + K2)^3 / sin^3(i) )\n\nwhere:\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n*   `i` is the inclination of the orbital plane with respect to our line of sight.\n\n**2. Simplify the Formula for this Problem**\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the mass of system_1 (M_total_1) to the mass of system_2 (M_total_2):\n\nRatio = M_total_1 / M_total_2\n\nWhen we create this ratio, the constant term (1 / (2 * π * G)) will cancel out. The formula simplifies to a proportionality:\n\nM_total ∝ P * (K1 + K2)^3 / sin^3(i)\n\nA crucial piece of information is that both systems are \"eclipsing\". An eclipse can only occur if we are viewing the system edge-on, which means the inclination `i` is very close to 90°. For i = 90°, sin(i) = 1, and therefore sin^3(i) = 1. Since both systems are eclipsing, we can assume sin^3(i) ≈ 1 for both, and this term cancels out in the ratio.\n\nSo, the proportionality simplifies further to:\n\nM_total ∝ P * (K1 + K2)^3\n\n**3. Gather the Data**\n\n*   **System 1:**\n    *   Period (P1) = 2 years\n    *   Sum of velocity amplitudes (K_sum_1) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n*   **System 2:**\n    *   Period (P2) = 1 year\n    *   Sum of velocity amplitudes (K_sum_2) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\n**4. Calculate the Ratio**\n\nUsing the proportionality from step 2:\n\nRatio = M_total_1 / M_total_2 = [P1 * (K_sum_1)^3] / [P2 * (K_sum_2)^3]\n\nNow, substitute the values:\n\nRatio = [2 * (15)^3] / [1 * (25)^3]\nRatio = 2 * (15 / 25)^3\nRatio = 2 * (3 / 5)^3\nRatio = 2 * (27 / 125)\nRatio = 54 / 125\nRatio = 0.432\n\n**5. Compare with Options**\n\nThe calculated ratio is 0.432. This value is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
