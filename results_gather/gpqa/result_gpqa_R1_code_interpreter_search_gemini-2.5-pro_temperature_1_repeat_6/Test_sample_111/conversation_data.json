    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Normalize the State Vector\nThe given quantum state is `|α⟩ ∝ (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩`.\nLet's write this as `|α⟩ = N * [(1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩]`, where N is the normalization constant.\nThe normalization condition is `⟨α|α⟩ = 1`.\n\nThe bra corresponding to `|α⟩` is `⟨α| = N* * [(1-i)⟨up| + (2+i)⟨down|]`.\n\nThe inner product is:\n`⟨α|α⟩ = |N|² * [(1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i)]`\nUsing the property `(a+bi)(a-bi) = a² + b²`:\n`⟨α|α⟩ = |N|² * [(1² + 1²) + (2² + 1²)]`\n`⟨α|α⟩ = |N|² * [(1 + 1) + (4 + 1)]`\n`⟨α|α⟩ = |N|² * (2 + 5) = 7|N|²`\n\nFor `⟨α|α⟩ = 1`, we must have `7|N|² = 1`, which gives `|N| = 1/√7`. We can choose the real, positive value `N = 1/√7`.\n\nSo, the normalized state is:\n`|α⟩ = (1/√7) * [(1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩]`\n\nIn the standard basis where `|up⟩ = [1, 0]ᵀ` and `|down⟩ = [0, 1]ᵀ`, the state vector is:\n`α = (1/√7) * [1+i, 2-i]ᵀ`\n\n### 2. Define the Operator A\nThe operator A is given by its matrix elements `Aij = hbar/2` if `i ≠ j`, and `Aij = 0` otherwise. For a 2x2 matrix, this means:\n`A₁₁ = 0`\n`A₂₂ = 0`\n`A₁₂ = hbar/2`\n`A₂₁ = hbar/2`\n\nSo the matrix representation of the operator A is:\n`A = [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]] = (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\nThis is `(hbar/2)` times the Pauli X matrix, `σₓ`.\n\n### 3. Find the Eigenvalues and Eigenstates of A\nTo find the possible outcomes of a measurement, we need to find the eigenvalues of the operator A. The characteristic equation is `det(A - λI) = 0`.\n\n`det([[ -λ, hbar/2 ], [ hbar/2, -λ ]]) = 0`\n`(-λ)(-λ) - (hbar/2)(hbar/2) = 0`\n`λ² - (hbar/2)² = 0`\n`λ² = (hbar/2)²`\n\nThe eigenvalues are `λ₁ = +hbar/2` and `λ₂ = -hbar/2`.\n\nNow, we find the corresponding normalized eigenstates:\n*   For `λ₁ = +hbar/2`:\n    `(A - λ₁I)v₁ = 0` => `[[-hbar/2, hbar/2], [hbar/2, -hbar/2]] [x, y]ᵀ = 0`\n    This gives the equation `-x + y = 0`, or `x = y`.\n    The unnormalized eigenvector is `[1, 1]ᵀ`. Normalizing it gives:\n    `|v₁⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 1]ᵀ = (1/√2) * (|up⟩ + |down⟩)`\n\n*   For `λ₂ = -hbar/2`:\n    `(A - λ₂I)v₂ = 0` => `[[hbar/2, hbar/2], [hbar/2, hbar/2]] [x, y]ᵀ = 0`\n    This gives the equation `x + y = 0`, or `x = -y`.\n    The unnormalized eigenvector is `[1, -1]ᵀ`. Normalizing it gives:\n    `|v₂⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, -1]ᵀ = (1/√2) * (|up⟩ - |down⟩)`\n\n### 4. Calculate the Probabilities\nThe probability of measuring a specific eigenvalue `λᵢ` is given by `P(λᵢ) = |⟨vᵢ|α⟩|²`.\n\n*   **Probability of measuring `λ₁ = +hbar/2`:**\n    `⟨v₁|α⟩ = [(1/√2)(⟨up| + ⟨down|)] * [(1/√7)((1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩)]`\n    `⟨v₁|α⟩ = (1/√14) * [(1+i)⟨up|up⟩ + (2-i)⟨up|down⟩ + (1+i)⟨down|up⟩ + (2-i)⟨down|down⟩]`\n    Since `⟨up|up⟩ = 1`, `⟨down|down⟩ = 1`, and `⟨up|down⟩ = ⟨down|up⟩ = 0`:\n    `⟨v₁|α⟩ = (1/√14) * [(1+i) + (2-i)] = 3/√14`\n    The probability is `P₁ = |3/√14|² = 9/14 ≈ 0.643`.\n\n*   **Probability of measuring `λ₂ = -hbar/2`:**\n    `⟨v₂|α⟩ = [(1/√2)(⟨up| - ⟨down|)] * [(1/√7)((1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩)]`\n    `⟨v₂|α⟩ = (1/√14) * [(1+i) - (2-i)] = (1/√14) * (-1 + 2i)`\n    The probability is `P₂ = |(-1 + 2i)/√14|² = ((-1)² + 2²)/14 = (1+4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.357`.\n\nThe probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.\n(Check: `P₁ + P₂ = 9/14 + 5/14 = 14/14 = 1`).\n\n### 5. Find the Average Value\nThe average (or expectation) value of the operator A is given by `⟨A⟩ = Σ Pᵢλᵢ`.\n`⟨A⟩ = P₁λ₁ + P₂λ₂`\n`⟨A⟩ = (9/14)(+hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2)`\n`⟨A⟩ = (hbar/2) * (9/14 - 5/14)`\n`⟨A⟩ = (hbar/2) * (4/14)`\n`⟨A⟩ = (hbar/2) * (2/7)`\n`⟨A⟩ = hbar/7`\n\n### Conclusion\nThe probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of A are **0.64** (for eigenvalue +hbar/2) and **0.36** (for eigenvalue -hbar/2), and the average value of the operator is **hbar/7**. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
