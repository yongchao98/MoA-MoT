    "This problem requires us to calculate the equilibrium concentration of free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) from the dissociation of a calcium-EDTA complex ($CaY^{2-}$).\n\n1.  **Reaction Setup**: We start with a 0.02 M solution of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. This complex will partially dissociate to reach equilibrium. The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n    $CaY^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n    (Note: For simplicity, we write EDTA⁴⁻ as Y⁴⁻).\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Constant**: We are given the formation constant ($K_f$ or $K_{Ca-EDTA}$), which describes the formation of the complex:\n    $Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons CaY^{2-}$\n    $K_f = \\frac{[CaY^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n3.  **ICE Table**: We can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table for the dissociation reaction to find the equilibrium concentrations. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n\n| Species         | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n|-----------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n| $CaY^{2-}$      | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| $Ca^{2+}$       | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| $Y^{4-}$        | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n4.  **Equilibrium Expression**: Now, we plug the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n    $K_f = \\frac{0.02 - x}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n5.  **Simplification and Calculation**: The formation constant ($K_f$) is very large, which means the dissociation is very small. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be negligible compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can make the approximation:\n    $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\n    The equation simplifies to:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n    Now, we solve for x, which represents the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ ions:\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 0.4 \\times 10^{-12} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7} M$\n\n    The concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. This matches option C.\n\nTo confirm the calculation without the approximation, we can use a small python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the constants\nK_f = 5e10  # Formation constant\nC = 0.02    # Initial concentration of the complex\n\n# Solve the simplified equation: x = sqrt(C / K_f)\nx_simplified = math.sqrt(C / K_f)\nprint(f\"Simplified calculation for x: {x_simplified:.2e}\")\n\n# For the exact solution, we solve the quadratic equation: K_f*x^2 + x - C = 0\n# a*x^2 + b*x + c = 0\na = K_f\nb = 1\nc = -C\n\n# Using the quadratic formula: x = (-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a)\n# We take the positive root as concentration cannot be negative.\ndiscriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c\nx_exact = (-b + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2 * a)\nprint(f\"Exact calculation for x: {x_exact:.2e}\")\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The user has provided the output of the Python code.\n\n1.  **Code Execution Analysis**:\n    *   The Python script was designed to solve for 'x', which represents the equilibrium concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ ions.\n    *   It first calculated the value using the simplified approximation: `x = sqrt(C / K_f)`. The output `Simplified calculation for x: 6.32e-07` confirms the manual calculation done in the initial reasoning.\n    *   It then solved the full quadratic equation `K_f*x^2 + x - C = 0` to get a more precise answer. The output `Exact calculation for x: 6.32e-07` shows that the value is identical to the simplified one, at least to three significant figures.\n    *   This confirms that the approximation `0.02 - x ≈ 0.02` was valid because 'x' is indeed much smaller than 0.02.\n\n2.  **Conclusion**:\n    *   The concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is calculated to be $6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n    *   This value corresponds to option C, which is $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n3.  **Final Answer Formulation**: The reasoning is sound, and the calculation has been verified. I am ready to provide the final answer. The problem asks for the concentration of free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) in a 0.02 M solution of Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n1.  **Understand the Chemistry**: We are given a solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, denoted as $CaY^{2-}$ (where Y represents the EDTA ligand). This complex is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA ($Y^{4-}$). The equilibrium is described by the dissociation of the complex:\n    $CaY^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Relate to the Formation Constant ($K_f$)**: The problem provides the formation constant ($K_{Ca-EDTA}$ or $K_f$), which is for the reverse reaction (the formation of the complex):\n    $Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons CaY^{2-}$\n    The expression for the formation constant is:\n    $K_f = \\frac{[CaY^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE Table**: To find the equilibrium concentrations, we can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table for the dissociation reaction. Let 'x' be the concentration of $CaY^{2-}$ that dissociates.\n\n| Species         | Initial Concentration (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium Concentration (M) |\n|-----------------|---------------------------|------------|-------------------------------|\n| $CaY^{2-}$      | 0.02                      | -x         | 0.02 - x                      |\n| $Ca^{2+}$       | 0                         | +x         | x                             |\n| $Y^{4-}$        | 0                         | +x         | x                             |\n\n    *   The initial concentration of the complex is given as 0.02 M.\n    *   Initially, there are no free $Ca^{2+}$ or $Y^{4-}$ ions.\n    *   As the complex dissociates, the concentration of reactants decreases by 'x' and the products increase by 'x'.\n\n4.  **Substitute into the Equilibrium Expression**: Now we substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n    $K_f = \\frac{0.02 - x}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n5.  **Simplify and Solve**: The formation constant ($K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10}$) is very large. This indicates that the equilibrium lies far to the right for the formation reaction, meaning the complex is very stable and dissociates very little. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can make the following approximation:\n    $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\n    The equation now becomes much simpler:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n    Now, we can solve for 'x', which represents the equilibrium concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$:\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 0.4 \\times 10^{-12}$\n    $x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} = 2 \\times 10^{-6.5}$\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n6.  **Conclusion**: The concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. This matches option C. The calculation was also confirmed using a python script which gave the same result, validating the approximation made.\n\n<<<C>>>"
