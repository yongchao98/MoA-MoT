    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y and Substance A2.**\n    The problem states that substance A2 is a binary fluoride of element Y with a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula for A2 be YF_n, where M_Y is the atomic mass of Y, M_F is the atomic mass of fluorine (~19.00 g/mol), and n is the number of fluorine atoms.\n\n    The formula for mass percentage is:\n    ɷF = (n * M_F) / (M_Y + n * M_F)\n\n    We can rearrange this to solve for M_Y:\n    0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M_Y + n * 19.00)\n    0.3196 * (M_Y + 19.00n) = 19.00n\n    0.3196 * M_Y + 6.0724n = 19.00n\n    0.3196 * M_Y = 12.9276n\n    M_Y = (12.9276 / 0.3196) * n\n    M_Y ≈ 40.45 * n\n\n    Now we can test integer values for n (which represents the oxidation state of Y in A2) to find a plausible atomic mass for Y.\n    *   n=1: M_Y ≈ 40.45 g/mol (similar to Ca, K)\n    *   n=2: M_Y ≈ 80.9 g/mol (similar to Br, Se, Kr)\n    *   n=3: M_Y ≈ 121.35 g/mol (similar to Sb, Te, I)\n    *   n=4: M_Y ≈ 161.8 g/mol (similar to Dy, Tb)\n    *   n=5: M_Y ≈ 202.25 g/mol (similar to Pb, Hg)\n\n2.  **Evaluate Candidate Elements.**\n    We need to find an element that matches one of these M_Y values and also fits the other chemical descriptions:\n    *   Forms five binary fluorides.\n    *   Has a fluoride (A1) that is a strong oxidizing agent (oxidizes xenon) and decomposes at room temperature (293 K). A1 decomposes to A2 and F2, so A1 has a higher oxidation state than A2.\n\n    Let's test the best candidates from the calculation:\n    *   **Krypton (Kr):** For n=2, M_Y ≈ 80.9 g/mol. Kr has M=83.8 g/mol. Let's check if A2=KrF2. The theoretical %F in KrF2 is (2*19)/ (83.8 + 38) = 31.2%. This is reasonably close. However, Kr only forms one well-characterized fluoride (KrF2), not five. This contradicts a key point.\n    *   **Antimony (Sb):** For n=3, M_Y ≈ 121.35 g/mol. The atomic mass of Sb is 121.76 g/mol. This is an excellent match. Let's check the %F in A2 = SbF3.\n        M(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\n        ɷF = (3 * 19.00) / 178.76 = 57 / 178.76 = 0.3188 or 31.88%.\n        This value (31.88%) is extremely close to the given value of 31.96%. This makes Sb the most likely candidate for Y.\n\n3.  **Verify Antimony (Sb) with Other Clues.**\n    Let's assume Y = Sb and A2 = SbF3.\n    *   **A1 decomposes to A2 (SbF3) and F2.** This implies A1 is a higher fluoride, which would be SbF5. The reaction is SbF5 -> SbF3 + F2.\n    *   **A1 oxidizes xenon.** SbF5 is a very strong Lewis acid and fluorinating agent, known to react with and oxidize xenon (e.g., Xe + 2SbF5 → [XeF][Sb2F11]). This fits.\n    *   **A3 is obtained by fluorination of Y.** Sb + F2 → SbF5. This reaction produces A3, which can also react with xenon. So A3 is also SbF5.\n    *   **Contradictions:** The problem states there are five binary fluorides of Y, but only SbF3 and SbF5 are common. It also states A1 is bright-red and decomposes at 293 K. SbF5 is a colorless liquid that is stable at 293K. These points seem to be flaws in the problem statement, but the numerical match for SbF3 is too strong to ignore.\n\n4.  **Identify Substance A4.**\n    The problem asks for the molecular weight range of A4. Based on our deductions, Y is Sb, and its known fluorides are A2=SbF3 and A1=A3=SbF5. A4 must be one of the binary fluorides of antimony. So, A4 is likely either SbF3 or SbF5.\n\n    Let's analyze the final reaction: \"By adding Y (Sb) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n    *   **If A4 = SbF5:** The reaction is Sb + SbF5 → A5. This is a plausible comproportionation reaction where Sb(0) reduces Sb(V).\n    *   **If A4 = SbF3:** The reaction is Sb + SbF3 → A5. This reaction is not chemically plausible under normal conditions, as you cannot reduce Sb(III) with Sb(0) metal.\n\n    This chemical reasoning suggests A4 should be SbF5. Let's calculate its molecular weight:\n    M(SbF5) = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = 216.76 g/mol.\n    This value (216.76) does not fall into any of the given ranges. It is close to range C (220-240), but not within it.\n\n    Let's consider the alternative, A4 = SbF3. Its molecular weight is:\n    M(SbF3) = 178.76 g/mol.\n    This value falls perfectly within range D (160-180).\n\n5.  **Conclusion.**\n    We have a conflict:\n    *   Chemical reasoning points to A4 = SbF5, but its MW doesn't match any option.\n    *   A perfect numerical match exists for A4 = SbF3 with option D, but the associated chemical reaction seems illogical as written.\n\n    In chemistry problems of this nature, a precise numerical fit is often the intended clue, and descriptive parts can sometimes be flawed or simplified. The identification of Y as Sb via the %F in SbF3 is very solid. The fact that the molecular weight of this very same compound, SbF3 (178.76 g/mol), fits perfectly into one of the answer ranges (160-180) is highly unlikely to be a coincidence. Therefore, it is most probable that A4 is intended to be SbF3, despite the problematic description of the final reaction.\n\n    The substance A4 is SbF3, and its molecular weight is 178.76 g/mol, which is in the range of 160-180.\n\n<<<D>>>"
