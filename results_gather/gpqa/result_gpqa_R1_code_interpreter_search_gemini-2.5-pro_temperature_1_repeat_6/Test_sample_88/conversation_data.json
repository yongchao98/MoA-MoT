    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the reaction sequence and identify the products.**\n\nThe overall reaction sequence is:\n1.  **1,3-dibromoadamantane** is treated with excess KOH at 240°C to form **Product 1**.\n2.  **Product 1** is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide [Al(O-iPr)₃] to form **Product 2**.\n3.  **Product 2** is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS) to form **Product 3**.\n\nOur goal is to determine the structure of Product 3 and find the coupling pattern of its most deshielded proton.\n\n**Analysis of Product 1:**\n*   Starting material: 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C₁₀H₁₄Br₂).\n*   Reagent: KOH, a strong base.\n*   Conditions: High temperature, suggesting rearrangements or eliminations that might otherwise be difficult.\n*   Spectroscopic data for Product 1:\n    *   IR: 1720 cm⁻¹. This is characteristic of a ketone (C=O) group.\n    *   ¹H NMR: 14 protons in total, which matches the number of protons in the starting material. This implies the adamantane cage is likely intact and the reaction is a substitution of the two Br atoms.\n*   From the IR and the proton count (implying a formula of C₁₀H₁₄O), Product 1 is a saturated tricyclic ketone.\n*   The provided ¹H NMR data (with a signal at 4.79 ppm) is highly unusual for a simple saturated ketone like adamantan-2-one. This data might be a \"red herring\" or belong to a very unusual rearranged structure. A common and plausible product from reactions on the adamantane skeleton under harsh conditions is **adamantan-2-one**. Let's hypothesize that Product 1 is adamantan-2-one and proceed, as this allows for a chemically logical sequence.\n\n**Analysis of the conversion of Product 1 to Product 2:**\n*   Reagent: Aluminum isopropoxide [Al(O-iPr)₃]. This reagent is famously used for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which converts ketones to alcohols.\n*   The subsequent reaction is ozonolysis, which cleaves C=C double bonds. This is a critical clue: **Product 2 must be an alkene**.\n*   How can a ketone (Product 1) be converted to an alkene (Product 2) using Al(O-iPr)₃? This can happen in a two-step sequence in the same pot:\n    1.  MPV reduction of the ketone to a secondary alcohol.\n    2.  Dehydration (elimination of water) of the alcohol to form an alkene, catalyzed by the Lewis acidic aluminum species at high temperature.\n*   Let's apply this to our hypothesized Product 1 (adamantan-2-one):\n    *   **Step 2a (Reduction):** Adamantan-2-one is reduced to adamantan-2-ol.\n    *   **Step 2b (Dehydration/Rearrangement):** Dehydration of adamantan-2-ol cannot directly form a double bond in the adamantane cage due to Bredt's rule (a double bond cannot be formed at a bridgehead). Instead, the reaction proceeds through a carbocation intermediate (at C2) which undergoes a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement. The adamantyl cation is known to rearrange to the more stable protoadamantyl cation. Loss of a proton from this rearranged cation leads to the formation of **protoadamantene**.\n*   Therefore, a very plausible structure for **Product 2** is **protoadamantene** (tricyclo[4.3.1.0³,⁸]dec-4-ene). Its formula is C₁₀H₁₄, which corresponds to an alkene with a tricyclic core (DoU = 3 rings + 1 C=C = 4).\n\n**Analysis of the conversion of Product 2 to Product 3:**\n*   Reagent: O₃ followed by DMS (reductive ozonolysis). This reaction cleaves the C=C double bond and replaces it with two carbonyl groups (aldehydes or ketones).\n*   **Product 2** is protoadamantene. The double bond is between C4 and C5. Let's analyze the groups attached to these carbons to predict the ozonolysis product.\n    *   In the protoadamantane skeleton, C4 is bonded to a hydrogen and to C3 (which is a -CH- group).\n    *   C5 is bonded to a hydrogen and to C6 (which is a -CH₂- group).\n*   Ozonolysis cleaves the C4=C5 bond, opening a ring and creating two aldehyde groups. The product, **Product 3**, will be a **bicyclo[4.3.1]decane-4,5-dicarbaldehyde**.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded proton in Product 3.**\n\n*   The most deshielded non-exchangeable protons in Product 3 are the two aldehyde protons (-CHO), which typically appear at δ 9-10 ppm.\n*   The coupling pattern (splitting) of a proton signal is determined by the number of adjacent protons according to the n+1 rule.\n*   Let's analyze the two different aldehyde protons in Product 3:\n    1.  **Aldehyde proton from C4:** The alpha-carbon to this aldehyde group is the original C3 of the protoadamantane skeleton. C3 is a methine (-CH-) group, meaning it has one proton. Therefore, this aldehyde proton will be split by one adjacent proton, resulting in a **doublet**.\n    2.  **Aldehyde proton from C5:** The alpha-carbon to this aldehyde group is the original C6 of the protoadamantane skeleton. C6 is a methylene (-CH₂-) group, meaning it has two protons. Therefore, this aldehyde proton will be split by two adjacent, equivalent protons, resulting in a **triplet** (n+1 = 2+1 = 3).\n*   So, the ¹H NMR spectrum of Product 3 will show two aldehyde signals, a doublet and a triplet.\n*   The question asks for \"the\" coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom. One of the two aldehyde protons will be the most deshielded. Looking at the answer choices:\n    A) doublet of triplets\n    B) triplet\n    C) pentet\n    D) triplet of triplets\n*   Of the patterns we predicted (doublet and triplet), only \"triplet\" is listed as an option. This is a common feature in multiple-choice questions where a product has multiple characteristic signals, and only one is provided as a correct option.\n\nTherefore, the coupling pattern is a triplet.\n\n<<<B>>>"
