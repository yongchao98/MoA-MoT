    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's identify the substituents and their positions on the benzene ring:\n*   Position 1: -OEt (ethoxy group)\n*   Position 2: -tBu (tert-butyl group)\n*   Position 3: -NO2 (nitro group)\n\nThe relationships between the groups are:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are **ortho** to each other.\n*   -NO2 and -tBu are **ortho** to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are **meta** to each other.\n\nThis is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring. Such substitution patterns are often challenging to synthesize and may require special strategies like using blocking groups.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), existing substituents direct new groups to specific positions:\n*   **-OEt (alkoxy)**: Strongly activating, ortho-, para-directing.\n*   **-tBu (alkyl)**: Weakly activating, ortho-, para-directing.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro)**: Strongly deactivating, meta-directing.\n*   **-NH2 (amino)**: Strongly activating, ortho-, para-directing. (Often protected or protonated in reactions).\n*   **-NH3+ (anilinium)**: Strongly deactivating, meta-directing.\n*   **-OH (hydroxyl)**: Strongly activating, ortho-, para-directing.\n*   **-SO3H (sulfonic acid)**: Strongly deactivating, meta-directing. Can be added and removed (blocking group).\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences (Options A-D)**\n\nLet's analyze each option step-by-step.\n\n**Option A:**\ni) Benzene -> Nitrobenzene\nii) Nitrobenzene -> Aniline\niii) Aniline + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. This reaction fails on rings with strongly activating groups like -NH2 because the amine acts as a Lewis base and coordinates with the AlCl3 catalyst, deactivating the ring. This makes Option A incorrect.\n\n**Option D:**\ni) Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene\nii) tert-Butylbenzene -> o/p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene (let's assume we isolate the ortho isomer, 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene).\niii) 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene + SO3/H2SO4 (Sulfonation)\niv) Product from (iii) + NaNO2/HCl (Diazotization): This step is impossible. Diazotization requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2 group), which is not present. This makes Option D incorrect.\n\n**Option C:**\nThis option uses a sulfonation/desulfonation strategy, which is often used for controlling substituent positions.\ni) Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene\nii) tert-Butylbenzene -> 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (Sulfonation blocks the para position, which is sterically favored).\niii) 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid -> 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid (Nitration is directed to the ortho position of the t-Bu group because the para position is blocked and both -tBu (o,p) and -SO3H (m) direct to this position). This is an excellent start.\niv) Reduction (Fe/HCl) -> 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\nv) Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) -> Forms a diazonium salt.\nvi) Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4): This step is chemically incorrect. One does not nitrate a diazonium salt in this manner.\nIf we ignore step (vi) and proceed to (vii) Hydrolysis (H3O+) and then (viii) Desulfonation (dilute H2SO4), the sequence would be: Diazonium salt -> 2-hydroxy-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid -> 3-tert-butylphenol. This is the wrong isomer to build the final product (it has a meta relationship between OH and tBu, not ortho). Thus, Option C is incorrect as written.\n\n**Option B:**\nLet's analyze this sequence carefully.\ni) **Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene**: A standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\nii) **tert-Butylbenzene --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> o-tert-butylnitrobenzene**: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene gives mainly the para-isomer due to sterics, but the ortho-isomer is also formed. The synthesis requires us to proceed with this minor product.\niii) **o-tert-butylnitrobenzene --(Fe/HCl)--> o-tert-butylaniline**: A standard reduction of a nitro group to an amine. The product is 2-tert-butylaniline.\niv) **o-tert-butylaniline --(HNO3/H2SO4)--> 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**: This is the most complex step. Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline would give a mixture of isomers. Under the strongly acidic conditions (H2SO4), the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a meta-director. The -tBu group is an o,p-director. Both groups direct incoming electrophiles to positions 3 and 5. The 5-nitro isomer is typically the major product. However, the desired 3-nitro isomer is formed as a minor product. The synthesis requires us to proceed with this isomer.\nv) **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline --(NaNO2/HCl)--> Diazonium salt**: Standard diazotization.\nvi) **Diazonium salt --(H3O+, H2O/Heat)--> 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**: Standard conversion of a diazonium salt to a phenol.\nvii) **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol --(NaOH/EtBr)--> 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**: This is a standard Williamson ether synthesis to convert the phenol to an ethoxy group. This step yields the final target molecule.\n\nSteps (viii) and (ix) (sulfonation and desulfonation of the final product) are nonsensical and appear to be extraneous or misplaced. However, the core sequence from (i) to (vii) is a chemically valid pathway to the desired product, even if it involves two steps (ii and iv) that would require separation of a minor isomer, contradicting the \"high-yield\" claim in the question.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\n*   Options A, C, and D contain chemically impossible steps or lead to the wrong isomer.\n*   Option B describes a sequence of reactions (i-vii) that correctly produces the target molecule. The main issues are the low yields in two steps and the two superfluous steps at the end.\n\nAmong the given choices, Option B is the only one that presents a chemically plausible (though inefficient) route to the final product. It is the \"best\" answer in a flawed set of options.\n\n<<<B>>>"
