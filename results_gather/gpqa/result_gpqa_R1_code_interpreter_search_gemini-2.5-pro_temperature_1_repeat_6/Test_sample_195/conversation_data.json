    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the maximum speed of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator.\n\n1.  **Define the Total Relativistic Energy**\n    The total energy ($E_{total}$) of a relativistic particle in a potential field is the sum of its relativistic energy ($E_{particle}$) and its potential energy ($U(x)$).\n    The particle's relativistic energy is given by $E_{particle} = \\gamma mc^2$, where $m$ is the rest mass, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n    The potential energy for a harmonic oscillator obeying Hooke's law ($F=-kx$) is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n    Therefore, the total energy of the system is:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n2.  **Apply the Principle of Conservation of Energy**\n    The total energy of the isolated system is constant throughout the oscillation. We can evaluate the total energy at two specific points in the motion: at maximum amplitude and at the equilibrium position (where speed is maximum).\n\n3.  **Calculate Total Energy at Maximum Amplitude**\n    At the point of maximum amplitude, the position is $x = A$. The particle momentarily stops to change direction, so its velocity is $v = 0$.\n    When $v=0$, the Lorentz factor $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n    The total energy at this point is:\n    $E_{total} = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n4.  **Calculate Total Energy at Maximum Speed**\n    The maximum speed ($v = v_{max}$) occurs when the particle passes through the equilibrium position, where the net force is zero. This happens at $x = 0$.\n    At $x=0$, the potential energy is $U(0) = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$.\n    The Lorentz factor corresponding to the maximum speed is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n    The total energy at this point is:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + 0 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n5.  **Equate the Energies and Solve for $v_{max}$**\n    Since energy is conserved, the total energy at maximum amplitude is equal to the total energy at maximum speed:\n    $\\gamma_{max}mc^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n    First, let's solve for $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2}{mc^2} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    Now, we use the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$ to find $v_{max}$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n    Square both sides:\n    $\\gamma_{max}^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}$\n    Rearrange to solve for $v_{max}$:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}$\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}$\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}}$\n\n    Finally, substitute the expression for $\\gamma_{max}$ we found earlier:\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n    This result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
