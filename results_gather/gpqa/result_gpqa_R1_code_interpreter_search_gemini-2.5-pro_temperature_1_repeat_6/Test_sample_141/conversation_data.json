    "An arbitrary density matrix $\\rho$ for a single qubit can be written in the Bloch representation as:\n$\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n\nwhere:\n*   $I$ is the 2x2 identity matrix: $I = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n*   $\\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)$ is the Bloch vector, which gives the geometrical position in the Bloch sphere.\n*   $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$ is the vector of Pauli matrices:\n    $\\sigma_x = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, $\\sigma_y = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, $\\sigma_z = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nThe components of the Bloch vector can be calculated using the formula $r_k = \\text{Tr}(\\sigma_k \\rho)$.\n\nFirst, let's write the given density matrix $\\rho$ in its matrix form. The basis states are:\n$|0\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $|1\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nThe outer products are:\n$|0\\rangle\\langle0| = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$|1\\rangle\\langle1| = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\rho$:\n$\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}\\left( |0\\rangle\\langle0| + |1\\rangle\\langle1| \\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{2}I$\n\nThis state is known as the maximally mixed state.\n\nNow, we can find the Bloch vector $\\vec{r}$ by comparing our $\\rho$ with the general form $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$.\n$\\frac{1}{2}I = \\frac{1}{2}(I + r_x\\sigma_x + r_y\\sigma_y + r_z\\sigma_z)$\n\nThis equality holds if and only if:\n$r_x\\sigma_x + r_y\\sigma_y + r_z\\sigma_z = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nSince the Pauli matrices are linearly independent, the only way for this linear combination to be the zero matrix is if all the coefficients are zero.\nTherefore, $r_x = 0$, $r_y = 0$, and $r_z = 0$.\n\nThe geometrical position is given by the vector $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$. This point is the center of the Bloch sphere.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) r=(0,0,1)\nB) r=(1,1,0)\nC) r=(1,1,1)\nD) r=(0,0,0)\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
