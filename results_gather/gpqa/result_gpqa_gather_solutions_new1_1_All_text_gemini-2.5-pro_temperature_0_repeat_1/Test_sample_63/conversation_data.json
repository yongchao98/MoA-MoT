The script hypothesized the salts to be Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃), which decompose as follows:\n    *   NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n    *   2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O (or per mole: NH₄NO₃ → N₂ + 0.5O₂ + 2H₂O)\n\n3.  **Constraint Application & Verification:** The script tested this hypothesis against the problem's constraints.\n    *   Since only Ammonium Nitrate produces O₂, the 0.025 mol of O₂ must have come from the decomposition of **0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃**.\n    *   Because the mixture is equimolar, there must also be **0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂**.\n    *   This hypothesis correctly predicts the amounts of the other products:\n        *   Total N₂ = 0.05 mol (from NH₄NO₂) + 0.05 mol (from NH₄NO₃) = **0.10 mol** (Matches experiment).\n        *   Total H₂O = 0.05*2 mol (from NH₄NO₂) + 0.05*2 mol (from NH₄NO₃) = **0.20 mol** (Matches experiment).\n    *   Finally, the total mass is verified: 0.05 mol * 64.04 g/mol (NH₄NO₂) + 0.05 mol * 80.04 g/mol (NH₄NO₃) = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = **7.20 g** (Matches experiment).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe salts A and B are Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃). The total number of atoms is calculated by summing the atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n*   Atoms in NH₄NO₂ = 1 + 4 + 1 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n*   Atoms in NH₄NO₃ = 1 + 4 + 1 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n*   Total atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the answer based on the provided chemical problem.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Gaseous Products**\n\nThe problem states that a mixture of gases is formed and passed through a series of tubes. Let's analyze the weight changes in these tubes to identify the products and their quantities.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   Mass of H₂O absorbed = 3.60 g.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases like CO₂.\n    *   The weight did not change, indicating that no CO₂ was produced in the reaction.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The increase in weight is due to the mass of oxygen.\n    *   Mass of O₂ reacted = 0.80 g.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After passing through the tubes, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n\n### **2. Identifying the Salts and Their Decomposition**\n\nThe initial substance is an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B, which decompose completely into gases upon heating. The products contain hydrogen, oxygen, and the element(s) in Gas C. The presence of hydrogen suggests the salts contain the ammonium cation (NH₄⁺), as it is a common cation in salts that decompose into gaseous products.\n\nLet's assume the salts are ammonium salts. The decomposition reactions for common ammonium salts containing nitrogen and oxygen are:\n1.  **Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** This salt is unstable and decomposes to form nitrogen gas and water.\n    *   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n2.  **Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** Its decomposition can vary with temperature.\n    *   At temperatures around 200°C, the primary reaction produces nitrous oxide and water: NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g).\n    *   At higher temperatures or in the presence of catalysts, another reaction can occur: 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g).\n\nThe production of O₂ (0.025 mol) in the experiment indicates that the second decomposition pathway for ammonium nitrate is occurring. The remaining gas, C, is therefore nitrogen (N₂).\n\n### **3. Stoichiometric Calculation**\n\nLet's assume the equimolar mixture consists of **x** moles of salt A and **x** moles of salt B.\n\nFrom the amount of O₂ produced, we can determine the moles of ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) that decomposed.\n*   Based on the reaction `2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O`, the molar ratio of NH₄NO₃ to O₂ is 2:1.\n*   Moles of NH₄NO₃ = 2 × Moles of O₂ = 2 × 0.025 mol = 0.05 mol.\n\nSince the mixture is equimolar, if one salt is NH₄NO₃ with x = 0.05 mol, then the other salt must also be present in the amount of x = 0.05 mol. Let's verify this by checking the other products.\n\n*   **Products from 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃:**\n    *   Moles of N₂ = 0.05 mol (from the 2:2 or 1:1 ratio with NH₄NO₃).\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 2 × 0.05 mol = 0.1 mol (from the 2:4 or 1:2 ratio with NH₄NO₃).\n\nNow, let's determine the products from the decomposition of 0.05 mol of the second salt, Salt A.\n*   **Total Moles of H₂O:** 0.2 mol.\n    *   H₂O from Salt A = Total H₂O - H₂O from NH₄NO₃ = 0.2 mol - 0.1 mol = 0.1 mol.\n*   **Total Moles of N₂ (Gas C):** 0.1 mol.\n    *   N₂ from Salt A = Total N₂ - N₂ from NH₄NO₃ = 0.1 mol - 0.05 mol = 0.05 mol.\n\nSo, the decomposition of 0.05 mol of Salt A produces 0.05 mol of N₂ and 0.1 mol of H₂O. This corresponds to a reaction stoichiometry of `1A → 1N₂ + 2H₂O`. This is the exact decomposition reaction for ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\nTherefore, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A:** Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂)\n*   **Salt B:** Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)\n\n### **4. Verification of Total Mass**\n\nLet's check if the total mass of 0.05 mol of each salt matches the given 7.20 g.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14.01 + 4(1.01) + 14.01 + 2(16.00) = 64.06 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14.01 + 4(1.01) + 14.01 + 3(16.00) = 80.06 g/mol.\n*   Total Mass = (0.05 mol × 64.06 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 80.06 g/mol) = 3.203 g + 4.003 g = 7.206 g.\nThis value is in excellent agreement with the given mass of 7.20 g.\n\n### **5. Calculating the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nFinally, we calculate the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is the sum of the atoms in each formula unit:\n*   Total Atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\n### Analysis of the Chemical Reaction\n\nBased on the experimental data, the decomposition of the salt mixture yields three products: water (H₂O), oxygen (O₂), and an inert gas, which is determined to be nitrogen (N₂).\n\n1.  **Water (H₂O):** The first tube, containing anhydrous magnesium perchlorate (Mg(ClO₄)₂), is a drying agent that absorbs water. The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.2 mol.\n\n2.  **Acidic Gases:** The second tube, with a calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)₂) solution, shows no change in weight. This indicates that no acidic gases, such as CO₂ or SO₂, were formed during the decomposition.\n\n3.  **Oxygen (O₂):** The third tube, containing red-hot copper, increased in mass by 0.80 g. This is due to the reaction of copper with oxygen to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass increase is solely from the oxygen.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n4.  **Inert Gas (N₂):** The remaining 2.24 liters of gas C, measured at standard temperature and pressure (STP), did not react with any of the previous substances. This volume corresponds to 0.1 mol of gas (2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol). The presence of nitrogen and hydrogen in the initial salts strongly suggests this gas is nitrogen (N₂).\n    *   Moles of N₂ = 0.1 mol.\n\n### Identification of Salts A and B\n\nThe products (H₂O, N₂, O₂) indicate that the original salts must contain hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen. Given they are salts, a logical conclusion is that they are ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing oxyanions. The two most common such salts are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nLet's examine their decomposition reactions:\n*   **Ammonium Nitrite:** Decomposes to form nitrogen gas and water.\n    *   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Ammonium Nitrate:** Its decomposition is more complex and depends on temperature. At around 200°C, it can decompose to produce nitrous oxide (N₂O) and water. However, at slightly higher temperatures or under specific conditions, it can decompose explosively to form nitrogen, oxygen, and water.\n    *   2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\nThis second decomposition pathway for ammonium nitrate produces all three observed gases. Therefore, it is highly probable that the equimolar mixture consists of ammonium nitrite (Salt A) and ammonium nitrate (Salt B).\n\n### Stoichiometric Verification\n\nLet 'n' be the number of moles for each salt in the equimolar mixture.\n\n*   From **n** moles of NH₄NO₂:\n    *   Produces **n** moles of N₂ and **2n** moles of H₂O.\n*   From **n** moles of NH₄NO₃ (using the 2:2:1:4 ratio):\n    *   Produces **n** moles of N₂, **n/2** moles of O₂, and **2n** moles of H₂O.\n\nTotal moles of products:\n*   Total H₂O = 2n + 2n = 4n\n*   Total N₂ = n + n = 2n\n*   Total O₂ = n/2\n\nUsing the experimental data:\n*   From H₂O: 4n = 0.2 mol ⇒ **n = 0.05 mol**\n*   From N₂: 2n = 2 * 0.05 = 0.1 mol (Matches the 0.1 mol of Gas C)\n*   From O₂: n/2 = 0.05 / 2 = 0.025 mol (Matches the 0.025 mol of O₂)\n\nThe calculations are consistent, confirming that the mixture contained 0.05 moles of ammonium nitrite and 0.05 moles of ammonium nitrate.\n\n### Calculation of Total Atoms\n\nNow, we determine the total number of atoms in one molecule of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite - NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2 atoms\n    *   **Total atoms in A = 8**\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate - NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3 atoms\n    *   **Total atoms in B = 9**\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is the sum of the atoms in each formula unit:\nTotal Atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThe analysis based on the products and their quantities logically led to identifying the salts as ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃). The google search confirms the decomposition reactions that were hypothesized.\n\n*   **Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) decomposition:** The primary products are nitrogen gas (N₂) and water (H₂O). The reaction is: NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g).\n*   **Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) decomposition:** The decomposition of ammonium nitrate is more complex and depends on the temperature. At temperatures between 185-200°C, it primarily decomposes into nitrous oxide (N₂O) and water. However, at higher temperatures or under certain conditions, it can undergo explosive decomposition to produce nitrogen (N₂), oxygen (O₂), and water (H₂O). The balanced equation for this reaction is: 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g).\n\nGiven that the products found in the experiment are N₂, O₂, and H₂O, it is clear that this second, more complete decomposition of ammonium nitrate occurred.\n\nThe step-by-step calculation was as follows:\n\n1.  **Determine moles of products:**\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g → 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol = 0.2 mol H₂O.\n    *   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g → 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol O₂.\n    *   Volume of Gas C (N₂) = 2.24 L at STP → 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol N₂.\n\n2.  **Set up reaction equations with an unknown molar amount 'n' for each salt:**\n    *   Salt A (NH₄NO₂): n NH₄NO₂ → n N₂ + 2n H₂O\n    *   Salt B (NH₄NO₃): n NH₄NO₃ → n N₂ + 0.5n O₂ + 2n H₂O (This is based on the 2:2:1:4 ratio from the balanced equation).\n\n3.  **Sum the products and equate to the experimental values:**\n    *   Total H₂O = 2n + 2n = 4n = 0.2 mol → n = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Total O₂ = 0.5n = 0.025 mol → n = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Total N₂ = n + n = 2n = 0.1 mol → n = 0.05 mol.\n    *   The value of n = 0.05 mol is consistent for all products.\n\n4.  **Verify the initial mass:**\n    *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.04 g/mol.\n    *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.04 g/mol.\n    *   Total mass = 0.05 mol * (64.04 g/mol + 80.04 g/mol) = 0.05 * 144.08 g = 7.204 g. This matches the given weight of 7.20 g.\n\n5.  **Calculate the total number of atoms:**\n    *   Salt A (NH₄NO₂): 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms.\n    *   Salt B (NH₄NO₃): 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms.\n    *   Total atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThe result is consistent and confirmed by the literature.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the experimental data to identify the products of decomposition.**\nThe problem states that a mixture of salts A and B was heated, decomposing completely into a mixture of gases. This gaseous mixture was then passed through a series of tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The weight of the tube increased by 3.60 g, which is the mass of the water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂. The problem states that the weight of this tube did not change. This is a crucial piece of information, indicating that no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition. This rules out salts containing anions like carbonate (CO₃²⁻).\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Red-hot copper is a reducing agent that reacts with oxidizing gases. In this context, it reacts with oxygen (O₂). The weight of the tube increased by 0.80 g, which corresponds to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 liters of a gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, one mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas did not react with the drying agent, the alkaline solution, or the hot copper. Given that the products include H₂O and O₂, the original salts likely contained H, O, and N. Therefore, Gas C is most likely nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the elemental composition of the original salt mixture.**\nFrom the products, we can calculate the total moles of each element present in the original 7.20 g mixture.\n*   Moles of Hydrogen (H) atoms = 2 × moles of H₂O = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   Moles of Nitrogen (N) atoms = 2 × moles of N₂ = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   Moles of Oxygen (O) atoms = (1 × moles of H₂O) + (2 × moles of O₂) = (1 × 0.20 mol) + (2 × 0.025 mol) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n\nThe molar ratio of the elements in the mixture is H : N : O = 0.40 : 0.20 : 0.25. To convert this to a simple integer ratio, we can multiply all values by 20:\nH : N : O = 8 : 4 : 5.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the individual salts A and B.**\nWe know the mixture is equimolar, meaning it contains an equal number of moles of salt A and salt B. The combined empirical formula for one unit of A plus one unit of B is H₈N₄O₅. Since the salts are composed of H, N, and O, they are likely ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing oxyanions.\nLet's test common salts:\n*   Ammonium nitrite: NH₄NO₂ (Formula: N₂H₄O₂)\n*   Ammonium nitrate: NH₄NO₃ (Formula: N₂H₄O₃)\n\nLet's sum the formulas of these two salts:\n(N₂H₄O₂) + (N₂H₄O₃) = N₄H₈O₅.\nThis perfectly matches the elemental ratio we derived. Therefore, salts A and B are ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the identification with stoichiometry and mass.**\nThe mixture is equimolar. Let 'n' be the number of moles of each salt.\nThe decomposition reactions that produce the observed products (N₂, O₂, H₂O) are:\n*   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)  (or per mole: NH₄NO₃ → N₂ + 0.5O₂ + 2H₂O)\n\nLet's calculate the expected moles of products from 'n' moles of each salt:\n*   Total H₂O = n(from NH₄NO₂) × 2 + n(from NH₄NO₃) × 2 = 4n\n*   Total N₂ = n(from NH₄NO₂) × 1 + n(from NH₄NO₃) × 1 = 2n\n*   Total O₂ = n(from NH₄NO₃) × 0.5 = 0.5n\n\nUsing our experimental values:\n*   From H₂O: 4n = 0.20 mol ⇒ n = 0.05 mol\n*   From N₂: 2n = 0.10 mol ⇒ n = 0.05 mol\n*   From O₂: 0.5n = 0.025 mol ⇒ n = 0.05 mol\nAll calculations yield n = 0.05 mol, confirming our hypothesis.\n\nFinally, let's check the total mass:\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.0 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.0 g/mol.\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol × 64.0 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 80.0 g/mol) = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass given in the problem.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total number of atoms.**\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B, which means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n*   Salt A (NH₄NO₂): 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = 8 atoms.\n*   Salt B (NH₄NO₃): 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = 9 atoms.\n*   Total number of atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe initial analysis appears to be correct. The search results confirm the decomposition products and reactions that were hypothesized.\n\n*   **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) Decomposition:** The thermal decomposition of ammonium nitrite produces nitrogen gas (N₂) and water (H₂O). The reaction is: NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O.\n*   **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃) Decomposition:** The decomposition of ammonium nitrate is more complex and depends on the temperature. At temperatures around 200-250°C, the primary products are nitrous oxide (N₂O) and water (H₂O). However, at higher temperatures or under certain conditions, it can decompose to produce nitrogen (N₂), oxygen (O₂), and water (H₂O). The problem specifies that O₂ was produced and passed over hot copper, and a final inert gas (deduced as N₂) remained. This indicates that the decomposition path producing O₂ and N₂ occurred: 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O.\n\nThe step-by-step chemical analysis based on the products formed is sound.\n\n1.  **Water (H₂O):** The mass increase of 3.60 g in the tube with anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂ corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n2.  **Oxygen (O₂):** The mass increase of 0.80 g in the tube with red-hot copper is due to the formation of CuO from O₂.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n3.  **Gas C (N₂):** The remaining 2.24 liters of gas at STP is the inert component.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol. This gas is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n4.  **Salts Identification:** The products (N₂, O₂, H₂O) strongly suggest the decomposition of ammonium salts containing nitrogen and oxygen. The two salts that fit this description and the stoichiometry are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\n5.  **Stoichiometric Verification:**\n    *   Let 'n' be the number of moles for each salt (equimolar mixture).\n    *   Reaction A: 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O\n    *   Reaction B: NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n    *   From 'n' moles of NH₄NO₃: (n/2) moles of O₂, n moles of N₂, and 2n moles of H₂O are produced.\n    *   From 'n' moles of NH₄NO₂: n moles of N₂ and 2n moles of H₂O are produced.\n    *   Total moles of O₂ = n/2 = 0.025 mol → n = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Total moles of N₂ = n + n = 2n = 0.1 mol → n = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Total moles of H₂O = 2n + 2n = 4n = 0.2 mol → n = 0.05 mol.\n    *   The calculated moles (n=0.05) are consistent for all products.\n\n6.  **Mass Verification:**\n    *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.04 g/mol.\n    *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.04 g/mol.\n    *   Total mass = 0.05 mol * (80.04 g/mol + 64.04 g/mol) = 0.05 * 144.08 = 7.204 g. This matches the initial mass of the mixture.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   Salt A is NH₄NO₃, which has 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 3(O) = 9 atoms.\n    *   Salt B is NH₄NO₂, which has 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 2(O) = 8 atoms.\n    *   The total number of atoms in both salts is 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nThe result is consistent and verified.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThe user wants me to solve a chemistry problem. I have already performed the reasoning and generated a Python script to verify the calculations. The script's output confirms my manual reasoning.\n\n**Summary of Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Identify Products and Moles:**\n    *   The mass increase of 3.60 g in the Mg(ClO₄)₂ tube corresponds to 3.60 g of H₂O. Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n    *   The mass increase of 0.80 g in the hot copper tube corresponds to 0.80 g of O₂. Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n    *   The remaining 2.24 L of gas at STP is an inert gas, identified as N₂. Moles of N₂ = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   The absence of mass change in the Ca(OH)₂ tube means no acidic gases (like CO₂, SO₂) were produced.\n\n2.  **Verify with Mass Conservation:**\n    *   Total mass of products = mass(H₂O) + mass(O₂) + mass(N₂)\n    *   Total mass = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + (0.10 mol * 28.0 g/mol) = 3.60 + 0.80 + 2.80 = 7.20 g.\n    *   This matches the initial mass of the mixture, confirming the products and their quantities are correct.\n\n3.  **Determine Elemental Composition of the Mixture:**\n    *   Moles of H = 2 * moles(H₂O) = 2 * 0.20 = 0.40 mol.\n    *   Moles of N = 2 * moles(N₂) = 2 * 0.10 = 0.20 mol.\n    *   Moles of O = 1 * moles(H₂O) + 2 * moles(O₂) = 0.20 + 2 * 0.025 = 0.25 mol.\n    *   The molar ratio of elements in the entire mixture is N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25. Multiplying by 20 gives an integer ratio of 4 : 8 : 5.\n\n4.  **Deduce Salt Formulas:**\n    *   The mixture is equimolar, so it contains 'n' moles of salt A and 'n' moles of salt B.\n    *   The combined formula for one unit of A and one unit of B is N₄H₈O₅.\n    *   The elements (N, H, O) suggest ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions.\n    *   Two ammonium ions (NH₄⁺), one for each salt, account for N₂H₈.\n    *   The remaining atoms for the two anions are (N₄H₈O₅) - (N₂H₈) = N₂O₅.\n    *   The two anions that sum to N₂O₅ are nitrite (NO₂⁻) and nitrate (NO₃⁻).\n    *   Therefore, the salts are A = NH₄NO₂ (Ammonium nitrite) and B = NH₄NO₃ (Ammonium nitrate).\n\n5.  **Calculate Total Atoms:**\n    *   Atoms in one formula unit of salt A (NH₄NO₂): 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 2(O) = 8 atoms.\n    *   Atoms in one formula unit of salt B (NH₄NO₃): 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 3(O) = 9 atoms.\n    *   Total number of atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThe code output confirms these calculations, showing a total of 17 atoms.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\n*   **Plan:**\n    1.

Identify the chemical nature of the gases produced and verify the composition by checking the mass balance.\n    3.  Deduce the identities of the two equimolar salts, A and B, that would decompose to form this specific mixture of gases.\n    4.  Count the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of salts A and B.\n\n*   **Action:** Calculate the moles of water (H₂O) absorbed, the moles of oxygen atoms that reacted with copper, and the moles of the final gas C.\n\n```python\n# Molar mass of H2O = 18.015 g/mol\n# Molar mass of O = 15.999 g/mol\n# Molar volume of a gas at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP) = 22.4 L/mol\n\n# Given data from the problem\nmass_increase_tube1 = 3.60  # g, corresponds to mass of H2O\nmass_increase_tube3 = 0.80    # g, corresponds to mass of O in CuO\nvolume_gas_C = 2.24  # L at STP\n\n# Calculate moles of each component\nmoles_H2O = mass_increase_tube1 / 18.015\nmoles_O_atoms = mass_increase_tube3 / 15.999\nmoles_gas_C = volume_gas_C / 22.4\n\nprint(f\"Moles of H2O = {moles_H2O:.4f} mol\")\nprint(f\"Moles of O atoms = {moles_O_atoms:.4f} mol\")\nprint(f\"Moles of gas C = {moles_gas_C:.4f} mol\")\n```\n\n*   **Result:**\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 0.1998 mol (approx. 0.20 mol)\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.0500 mol\n    *   Moles of gas C = 0.1000 mol\n\n*   **Plan Refinement:**\n    1.  The products are ~0.20 mol H₂O, an oxidizing gas that supplied 0.05 mol of O atoms, and 0.10 mol of an inert gas C. The inert gas C is likely N₂.\n    2.  The oxidizing gas reacted with hot copper (`Cu + [O] -> CuO`). A common nitrogen-based oxidizing gas from decomposition is N₂O. The reaction `N₂O + Cu -> N₂ + CuO` shows that 1 mole of N₂O provides 1 mole of O atoms. Therefore, the amount of N₂O must have been 0.05 mol.\n    3.  This reaction also produces 0.05 mol of N₂. The final gas C (0.10 mol N₂) is the sum of this produced N₂ and any N₂ present in the initial gas mixture. Therefore, initial N₂ = 0.10 mol (total) - 0.05 mol (from N₂O) = 0.05 mol.\n    4.  The initial gas mixture was: 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.05 mol N₂O, and 0.05 mol N₂. Let's verify this by checking if the total mass equals the starting 7.20 g.\n\n*   **Action:** Calculate the total mass of the deduced gas mixture (0.20 mol H₂O, 0.05 mol N₂O, 0.05 mol N₂).\n\n```python\n# Moles of each gas component (using rounded values for clarity)\nmoles_H2O = 0.20\nmoles_N2O = 0.05\nmoles_N2 = 0.05\n\n# Molar masses (g/mol)\nM_H2O = 18.015\nM_N2O = 44.013  # 2*14.007 + 15.999\nM_N2 = 28.014   # 2*14.007\n\n# Calculate the mass of each component and the total mass\nmass_H2O = moles_H2O * M_H2O\nmass_N2O = moles_N2O * M_N2O\nmass_N2 = moles_N2 * M_N2\ntotal_mass = mass_H2O + mass_N2O + mass_N2\n\nprint(f\"Calculated total mass = {total_mass:.2f} g\")\nprint(f\"Initial mass of salts = 7.20 g\")\n```\n\n*   **Result:**\n    *   Calculated total mass = 7.20 g\n    *   Initial mass of salts = 7.20 g\n    *   The mass balance is correct, confirming the identity and amounts of the gaseous products.\n\n*   **Plan Refinement:**\n    1.  We need to find two equimolar salts that decompose to yield 0.05 mol N₂, 0.05 mol N₂O, and 0.20 mol H₂O.\n    2.  The decomposition of ammonium nitrate (`NH₄NO₃ -> N₂O + 2H₂O`) and ammonium nitrite (`NH₄NO₂ -> N₂ + 2H₂O`) fit these products.\n    3.  If we have an equimolar mixture of `n` moles each, the products are `n` mol N₂O, `n` mol N₂, and `4n` mol H₂O. The molar ratio is 1:1:4.\n    4.  Our experimental results (0.05 mol N₂O : 0.05 mol N₂ : 0.20 mol H₂O) perfectly match the 1:1:4 ratio, with `n = 0.05` mol.\n    5.  Thus, the salts are NH₄NO₃ and NH₄NO₂. The final step is to count the atoms in their formulas.\n\n*   **Action:** Count the total number of atoms in the formulas NH₄NO₃ and NH₄NO₂.\n\n```python\n# Salt A is Ammonium Nitrate: NH4NO3\n# Number of atoms in NH4NO3 = 2 N + 4 H + 3 O\natoms_A = 2 + 4 + 3\n\n# Salt B is Ammonium Nitrite: NH4NO2\n# Number of atoms in NH4NO2 = 2 N + 4 H + 2 O\natoms_B = 2 + 4 + 2\n\n# Total number of atoms in both salt formulas\ntotal_atoms = atoms_A + atoms_B\n\nprint(f\"Atoms in NH4NO3 = {atoms_A}\")\nprint(f\"Atoms in NH4NO2 = {atoms_B}\")\nprint(f\"Total atoms = {total_atoms}\")\n```\n\n*   **Result:**\n    *   Atoms in NH₄NO₃ = 9\n    *   Atoms in NH₄NO₂ = 8\n    *   Total atoms = 17\n\n*   **Final Answer:** The logical deduction confirmed that the salts are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂). The total number of atoms in their respective formulas is 9 and 8, giving a sum of 17.\n\n<<<A>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: Moles of H2O = 0.1998 mol\nMoles of O atoms = 0.0500 mol\nMoles of gas C = 0.1000 mol\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the answer:\n\n**1. Analyze the Gas Separation Process**\n\n*   The mixture of gases from the decomposition is passed through a series of tubes to identify its components.\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a powerful drying agent that absorbs water. The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of the water (H₂O) produced.\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which reacts with acidic gases like CO₂ to form a precipitate (calcium carbonate), which would increase the tube's weight. Since the weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition.\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form black copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass increase of 0.80 g corresponds to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n*   **Gas C:** The remaining gas, measuring 2.24 liters at standard temperature and pressure (STP), is inert to the previous reagents. This volume corresponds to a specific number of moles.\n\n**2. Calculate the Moles of Each Gaseous Product**\n\n*   **Water (H₂O):**\n    *   Mass = 3.60 g\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol\n\n*   **Oxygen (O₂):**\n    *   Mass = 0.80 g\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol\n\n*   **Gas C:**\n    *   Volume = 2.24 L at STP\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol\n    *   Given that the original salts are nitrogen-based (a common feature of salts that decompose into gases), Gas C is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**3. Identify the Salts Based on Decomposition Products**\n\nWe need to find two nitrogen-containing salts that, when decomposed in an equimolar ratio, produce 0.2 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.1 mol N₂. Let's consider common ammonium salts.\n\n*   **Salt A: Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂)**\n    *   The thermal decomposition of ammonium nitrite produces nitrogen gas and water.\n    *   Reaction: NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n\n*   **Salt B: Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**\n    *   The decomposition of ammonium nitrate is complex and depends on temperature. At around 200°C, it typically produces N₂O and H₂O. However, a different decomposition pathway can occur, especially under certain conditions, that yields nitrogen, oxygen, and water.\n    *   Reaction: 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O\n\n**4. Verify the Molar Ratios and Mass**\n\nLet's assume the mixture contains 'x' moles of Salt A (NH₄NO₂) and 'x' moles of Salt B (NH₄NO₃). Based on the stoichiometry of their decomposition reactions:\n\n*   From **x mol of NH₄NO₂**: Produces **x mol of N₂** and **2x mol of H₂O**.\n*   From **x mol of NH₄NO₃**: Produces **x mol of N₂**, **(x/2) mol of O₂**, and **2x mol of H₂O**.\n\nNow, let's sum the total moles of each product:\n*   **Total N₂:** x + x = 2x\n*   **Total H₂O:** 2x + 2x = 4x\n*   **Total O₂:** x/2\n\nFrom our initial calculations, we know:\n*   Total N₂ = 0.1 mol\n*   Total H₂O = 0.2 mol\n*   Total O₂ = 0.025 mol\n\nLet's solve for 'x' using the products:\n*   2x = 0.1 mol  =>  x = 0.05 mol\n*   4x = 4 * 0.05 = 0.2 mol (This matches the H₂O produced)\n*   x/2 = 0.05 / 2 = 0.025 mol (This matches the O₂ produced)\n\nThe value x = 0.05 mol is consistent for all products. This confirms we have 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\n\nLet's check if the total mass matches the given 7.20 g.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.04 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.04 g/mol\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol * 64.04 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 80.04 g/mol)\n*   Total mass = 3.202 g + 4.002 g = 7.204 g\nThis matches the initial weight of the mixture.\n\n**5.

Analyze the products of the decomposition:**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a powerful drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂.

Identify the initial salts based on the products:**\n\nThe gaseous products are H₂O, O₂, and N₂. The original salts must contain the elements Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O). Common salts containing these elements are ammonium salts of nitrogen-based acids. Let's consider ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\n*   **Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** This salt decomposes to form nitrogen gas and water.\n    *   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** At high temperatures (the problem states 200°C), one of its decomposition pathways produces nitrogen, oxygen, and water.\n    *   2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\nThis set of reactions produces N₂, O₂, and H₂O, matching the experimental results.\n\n**3.

Verify the initial mass:**\n\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.04 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.05 g/mol\n*   Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 0.05 mol * 64.04 g/mol = 3.202 g\n*   Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 0.05 mol * 80.05 g/mol = 4.0025 g\n*   Total Mass = 3.202 g + 4.0025 g = 7.2045 g.

Analyze the Gaseous Products\n\nThe initial mixture of salts, weighing 7.20 g, was heated and decomposed completely into a mixture of gases. These gases were passed through a series of tubes, allowing us to identify and quantify them.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a powerful drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The weight of this tube increased by 3.60 g, which corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which reacts with acidic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂). Since the weight of this tube did not change, no CO₂ was produced during the decomposition. This indicates the absence of carbon in the original salts.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The weight increase of 0.80 g is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After passing through the three tubes, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas (at standard temperature and pressure) remained.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n\nThe total mass of the gaseous products (Water + Oxygen + Gas C) must equal the initial mass of the salts (7.20 g).\n*   Mass of Gas C = 7.20 g - 3.60 g (H₂O) - 0.80 g (O₂) = 2.80 g.\n*   Molar mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.1 mol = 28 g/mol.\n\nA gas with a molar mass of 28 g/mol that is unreactive under these conditions is nitrogen (N₂). Therefore, the decomposition products are H₂O, O₂, and N₂.\n\n### 2. Identify the Salts A and B\n\nThe elements present in the products are Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O). This means the original salts A and B must be composed of these elements. Given they are salts, a likely cation is ammonium (NH₄⁺), and the anions would be nitrogen-oxygen anions (oxyanions). The two most common such salts are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nLet's test the hypothesis that the equimolar mixture consists of Salt A = Ammonium Nitrite and Salt B = Ammonium Nitrate.\n\nThe thermal decomposition reactions are:\n*   **Ammonium Nitrite:** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Ammonium Nitrate:** 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\nLet 'n' be the number of moles for each salt in the equimolar mixture.\n\nFrom the decomposition of 'n' moles of each salt:\n*   **Total Moles of N₂:** n (from NH₄NO₂) + n (from NH₄NO₃) = 2n\n*   **Total Moles of H₂O:** 2n (from NH₄NO₂) + 2n (from NH₄NO₃) = 4n\n*   **Total Moles of O₂:** 0.5n (from NH₄NO₃)\n\nUsing the moles calculated from the experimental data:\n*   From O₂: 0.5n = 0.025 mol  => **n = 0.05 mol**\n*   Checking with N₂: 2n = 2 * 0.05 = 0.1 mol. This matches the experimental result.\n*   Checking with H₂O: 4n = 4 * 0.05 = 0.2 mol. This also matches the experimental result.\n\nThe value of n = 0.05 mol is consistent across all products, confirming that the salts are indeed ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms\n\nNow, we determine the number of atoms in one molecule of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite - NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   1 Nitrogen (N) + 4 Hydrogen (H) + 1 Nitrogen (N) + 2 Oxygen (O) = **8 atoms**\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate - NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   1 Nitrogen (N) + 4 Hydrogen (H) + 1 Nitrogen (N) + 3 Oxygen (O) = **9 atoms**\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is the sum of the atoms in each formula unit.\n*   Total Atoms = Atoms in Salt A + Atoms in Salt B = 8 + 9 = 17\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe analysis and code from the previous step have successfully identified the two salts and verified that they meet all the constraints of the problem.\n\n*   **Salt A:** Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂)\n    *   Number of atoms = 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n*   **Salt B:** Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)\n    *   Number of atoms = 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n*   **Total Atoms:** The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.\n    *   Total = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nProposer: The problem requires us to identify two salts, A and B, based on their decomposition products. The first step is to analyze the information from the three tubes and the remaining gas to determine the chemical composition and molar quantities of the gaseous products.\n\nSkeptic: This approach seems logical. However, we must be careful with our assumptions. The identity of gas C is not explicitly given, and the decomposition reactions of the initial salts can be complex and temperature-dependent. We need to ensure our deductions are consistent across all given data points (mass changes, gas volume, etc.).\n\nProposer: I will start by calculating the moles of the substances absorbed or reacted in each tube and the moles of the final gas C. This is a direct calculation from the data provided and involves no assumptions yet.\n\nProposer:\nBased on the search results and chemical principles, I can now determine the products of the reaction.\n\n1.  **Tube №1 (Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube absorbs water. The mass increase is 3.60 g.\n    *   The molar mass of water (H₂O) is approximately 18.015 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.015 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol.\n\n2.  **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂):** The weight did not change, which means no acidic gases like CO₂ were produced.\n\n3.  **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** This tube's weight increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of CuO. This mass increase corresponds to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 0.80 g.\n    *   The gas passing through would be molecular oxygen (O₂). The molar mass of an oxygen atom is ~16.00 g/mol, so the molar mass of O₂ is ~32.00 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n4.  **Gas C:** This is the remaining gas. Its volume is 2.24 L at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   The molar volume of any ideal gas at STP is 22.4 L/mol.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\nNow, I will determine the identity of Gas C by calculating its molar mass. The total initial mass was 7.20 g. By conservation of mass, this must equal the total mass of the products.\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of Gas C = Total Mass - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(O₂) = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n*   Molar Mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n\nA gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol that is inert in this series of reactions is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n\nSo, the decomposition produced:\n*   0.20 mol H₂O\n*   0.025 mol O₂\n*   0.10 mol N₂\n\nMy next step is to determine the empirical formula of the initial salt mixture from these products and then deduce the formulas of salts A and B.\n\nSkeptic:\nYour analysis of the products seems sound. The identification of Gas C as N₂ is well-supported. The crucial step is now identifying the two initial salts. You have the total elemental composition of the mixture (N, H, O), but you need to partition it into two distinct, equimolar salts that are chemically plausible. The decomposition reactions you will need to assume must also be plausible for the given conditions.\n\nProposer:\nI will now determine the total moles of each element (N, H, O) in the original mixture. From there, I will deduce the formulas of the two equimolar salts, A and B.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** From 0.20 mol H₂O -> 0.20 * 2 = 0.40 mol H.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** From 0.10 mol N₂ -> 0.10 * 2 = 0.20 mol N.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** From 0.20 mol H₂O + 0.025 mol O₂ -> (0.20 * 1) + (0.025 * 2) = 0.25 mol O.\n\nThe initial mixture contains 0.40 mol H, 0.20 mol N, and 0.25 mol O. Since salts A and B are in an equimolar mixture, let's say we have 'n' moles of A and 'n' moles of B. The total moles of N are 0.20, so 2n * (average N atoms per salt) = 0.20.\n\nLet's consider the simplest case where the total moles of salts are 0.10 mol (0.05 mol A + 0.05 mol B).\nThis would mean the total formula of the mixture (A+B) contains:\n*   N: 0.20 mol / 0.05 = 4\n*   H: 0.40 mol / 0.05 = 8\n*   O: 0.25 mol / 0.05 = 5\nSo, the combined formula is N₄H₈O₅.\n\nWe need to split N₄H₈O₅ into two plausible salts. Common salts containing these elements are ammonium salts. The NH₄⁺ ion accounts for NH₄.\n*   If we have two ammonium salts, we use 2 * NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈.\n*   The remaining atoms for the two anions are N₂O₅.\n*   The two most common oxyanions of nitrogen are nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻).\n*   NO₃⁻ + NO₂⁻ = N₂O₅.\n\nThis fits perfectly. So, the salts are:\n*   **Salt A:** NH₄NO₃ (Ammonium nitrate)\n*   **Salt B:** NH₄NO₂ (Ammonium nitrite)\n\nLet's check the decomposition reactions:\n*   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\nThe molar ratio of products from these reactions (N₂ : O₂ : H₂O) is (1+1) : (1/2) : (2+2) for every 1 mole of B and 1 mole of A (in the 2NH4NO3 form), which simplifies to 4 : 1 : 8.\nOur experimental molar ratio is N₂ : O₂ : H₂O = 0.10 : 0.025 : 0.20, which also simplifies to 4 : 1 : 8. The hypothesis is consistent.\n\nThe final step is to calculate the total number of atoms in the formulas of salts A and B.\n*   Salt A (NH₄NO₃): 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 3 O = 9 atoms.\n*   Salt B (NH₄NO₂): 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 2 O = 8 atoms.\n*   Total atoms = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nSkeptic:\nThe logic is consistent and all data points are accounted for. The assumed decomposition of ammonium nitrate to N₂, O₂, and H₂O is non-standard at 200°C, but within the context of a stoichiometry problem where the products are clearly defined by the analytical tests, this is a required inference. The conclusion seems solid.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the gaseous products and calculate their molar quantities.**\n\nThe problem describes a series of analytical steps to identify the gases produced from the decomposition of the salt mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, used to detect acidic gases like CO₂. The weight did not change, indicating **no acidic gases** were formed. This rules out salts containing carbonate or other anions that would produce acidic gases.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = **0.025 mol**.\n\n*   **Gas C (remaining gas):** After the other gases were removed, 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n*   **Identify Gas C:** We can use the law of conservation of mass. The initial mass (7.20 g) must equal the total mass of the products.\n    *   Mass of products = Mass(H₂O) + Mass(O₂) + Mass(Gas C)\n    *   7.20 g = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + Mass(Gas C)\n    *   Mass(Gas C) = 7.20 g - 4.40 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Molar Mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n    *   A gas that is inert in this context and has a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**Step 2: Deduce the identity of the salts A and B.**\n\nThe products are H₂O, O₂, and N₂. This means the original salts must contain the elements H, O, and N. Since they are salts, a logical hypothesis is that they are ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing oxyanions. The two most common are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nLet's test this hypothesis. The mixture is equimolar, so let's assume it contains 'n' moles of each salt. We need to find the decomposition reactions that produce the observed gases.\n\n*   **Ammonium Nitrite:** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Ammonium Nitrate:** The decomposition of NH₄NO₃ is temperature-dependent. While at lower temperatures it produces N₂O, the presence of O₂ and N₂ as products points to a different reaction pathway: 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g).\n\n**Step 3: Verify the stoichiometry.**\n\nLet's calculate the total moles of each product from a mixture of 'n' moles of NH₄NO₂ and 'n' moles of NH₄NO₃.\n\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₂: produces `n` moles of N₂ and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₃ (using the 2:2:1:4 ratio, which is 1:1:0.5:2 per mole): produces `n` moles of N₂, `0.5n` moles of O₂, and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n\nTotal moles of products:\n*   Total N₂ = `n` + `n` = `2n`\n*   Total H₂O = `2n` + `2n` = `4n`\n*   Total O₂ = `0.5n`\n\nNow, we use our experimental values to solve for 'n':\n*   From O₂: `0.5n` = 0.025 mol  => **n = 0.05 mol**\n*   Check with N₂: `2n` = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol. (This matches the experimental value).\n*   Check with H₂O: `4n` = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol. (This also matches the experimental value).\n\nThe value n = 0.05 mol is consistent for all products, confirming our hypothesis. The mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B, which means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (e.g., NH₄NO₂):** 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 2 O = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Salt B (e.g., NH₄NO₃):** 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 3 O = **9 atoms**.\n\nTotal number of atoms = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"

Analysis of the Gaseous Products**\n\nThe problem states that a mixture of gases is formed and passed through a series of tubes. Let's analyze the weight changes in these tubes to identify the products and their quantities.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   Mass of H₂O absorbed = 3.60 g.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases like CO₂.\n    *   The weight did not change, indicating that no CO₂ was produced in the reaction.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The increase in weight is due to the mass of oxygen.\n    *   Mass of O₂ reacted = 0.80 g.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After passing through the tubes, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n\n### **2. Identifying the Salts and Their Decomposition**\n\nThe initial substance is an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B, which decompose completely into gases upon heating. The products contain hydrogen, oxygen, and the element(s) in Gas C. The presence of hydrogen suggests the salts contain the ammonium cation (NH₄⁺), as it is a common cation in salts that decompose into gaseous products.\n\nLet's assume the salts are ammonium salts. The decomposition reactions for common ammonium salts containing nitrogen and oxygen are:\n1.  **Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** This salt is unstable and decomposes to form nitrogen gas and water.\n    *   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n2.  **Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** Its decomposition can vary with temperature.\n    *   At temperatures around 200°C, the primary reaction produces nitrous oxide and water: NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g).\n    *   At higher temperatures or in the presence of catalysts, another reaction can occur: 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g).\n\nThe production of O₂ (0.025 mol) in the experiment indicates that the second decomposition pathway for ammonium nitrate is occurring. The remaining gas, C, is therefore nitrogen (N₂).\n\n### **3. Stoichiometric Calculation**\n\nLet's assume the equimolar mixture consists of **x** moles of salt A and **x** moles of salt B.\n\nFrom the amount of O₂ produced, we can determine the moles of ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) that decomposed.\n*   Based on the reaction `2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O`, the molar ratio of NH₄NO₃ to O₂ is 2:1.\n*   Moles of NH₄NO₃ = 2 × Moles of O₂ = 2 × 0.025 mol = 0.05 mol.\n\nSince the mixture is equimolar, if one salt is NH₄NO₃ with x = 0.05 mol, then the other salt must also be present in the amount of x = 0.05 mol. Let's verify this by checking the other products.\n\n*   **Products from 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃:**\n    *   Moles of N₂ = 0.05 mol (from the 2:2 or 1:1 ratio with NH₄NO₃).\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 2 × 0.05 mol = 0.1 mol (from the 2:4 or 1:2 ratio with NH₄NO₃).\n\nNow, let's determine the products from the decomposition of 0.05 mol of the second salt, Salt A.\n*   **Total Moles of H₂O:** 0.2 mol.\n    *   H₂O from Salt A = Total H₂O - H₂O from NH₄NO₃ = 0.2 mol - 0.1 mol = 0.1 mol.\n*   **Total Moles of N₂ (Gas C):** 0.1 mol.\n    *   N₂ from Salt A = Total N₂ - N₂ from NH₄NO₃ = 0.1 mol - 0.05 mol = 0.05 mol.\n\nSo, the decomposition of 0.05 mol of Salt A produces 0.05 mol of N₂ and 0.1 mol of H₂O. This corresponds to a reaction stoichiometry of `1A → 1N₂ + 2H₂O`. This is the exact decomposition reaction for ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\nTherefore, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A:** Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂)\n*   **Salt B:** Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)\n\n### **4. Verification of Total Mass**\n\nLet's check if the total mass of 0.05 mol of each salt matches the given 7.20 g.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14.01 + 4(1.01) + 14.01 + 2(16.00) = 64.06 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14.01 + 4(1.01) + 14.01 + 3(16.00) = 80.06 g/mol.\n*   Total Mass = (0.05 mol × 64.06 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 80.06 g/mol) = 3.203 g + 4.003 g = 7.206 g.\nThis value is in excellent agreement with the given mass of 7.20 g.\n\n### **5. Calculating the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nFinally, we calculate the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is the sum of the atoms in each formula unit:\n*   Total Atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\n### Analysis of the Chemical Reaction\n\nBased on the experimental data, the decomposition of the salt mixture yields three products: water (H₂O), oxygen (O₂), and an inert gas, which is determined to be nitrogen (N₂).\n\n1.  **Water (H₂O):** The first tube, containing anhydrous magnesium perchlorate (Mg(ClO₄)₂), is a drying agent that absorbs water. The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.2 mol.\n\n2.  **Acidic Gases:** The second tube, with a calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)₂) solution, shows no change in weight. This indicates that no acidic gases, such as CO₂ or SO₂, were formed during the decomposition.\n\n3.  **Oxygen (O₂):** The third tube, containing red-hot copper, increased in mass by 0.80 g. This is due to the reaction of copper with oxygen to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass increase is solely from the oxygen.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n4.  **Inert Gas (N₂):** The remaining 2.24 liters of gas C, measured at standard temperature and pressure (STP), did not react with any of the previous substances. This volume corresponds to 0.1 mol of gas (2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol). The presence of nitrogen and hydrogen in the initial salts strongly suggests this gas is nitrogen (N₂).\n    *   Moles of N₂ = 0.1 mol.\n\n### Identification of Salts A and B\n\nThe products (H₂O, N₂, O₂) indicate that the original salts must contain hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen. Given they are salts, a logical conclusion is that they are ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing oxyanions. The two most common such salts are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nLet's examine their decomposition reactions:\n*   **Ammonium Nitrite:** Decomposes to form nitrogen gas and water.\n    *   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Ammonium Nitrate:** Its decomposition is more complex and depends on temperature. At around 200°C, it can decompose to produce nitrous oxide (N₂O) and water. However, at slightly higher temperatures or under specific conditions, it can decompose explosively to form nitrogen, oxygen, and water.\n    *   2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\nThis second decomposition pathway for ammonium nitrate produces all three observed gases. Therefore, it is highly probable that the equimolar mixture consists of ammonium nitrite (Salt A) and ammonium nitrate (Salt B).\n\n### Stoichiometric Verification\n\nLet 'n' be the number of moles for each salt in the equimolar mixture.\n\n*   From **n** moles of NH₄NO₂:\n    *   Produces **n** moles of N₂ and **2n** moles of H₂O.\n*   From **n** moles of NH₄NO₃ (using the 2:2:1:4 ratio):\n    *   Produces **n** moles of N₂, **n/2** moles of O₂, and **2n** moles of H₂O.\n\nTotal moles of products:\n*   Total H₂O = 2n + 2n = 4n\n*   Total N₂ = n + n = 2n\n*   Total O₂ = n/2\n\nUsing the experimental data:\n*   From H₂O: 4n = 0.2 mol ⇒ **n = 0.05 mol**\n*   From N₂: 2n = 2 * 0.05 = 0.1 mol (Matches the 0.1 mol of Gas C)\n*   From O₂: n/2 = 0.05 / 2 = 0.025 mol (Matches the 0.025 mol of O₂)\n\nThe calculations are consistent, confirming that the mixture contained 0.05 moles of ammonium nitrite and 0.05 moles of ammonium nitrate.\n\n### Calculation of Total Atoms\n\nNow, we determine the total number of atoms in one molecule of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite - NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2 atoms\n    *   **Total atoms in A = 8**\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate - NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3 atoms\n    *   **Total atoms in B = 9**\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is the sum of the atoms in each formula unit:\nTotal Atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThe analysis based on the products and their quantities logically led to identifying the salts as ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃). The google search confirms the decomposition reactions that were hypothesized.\n\n*   **Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) decomposition:** The primary products are nitrogen gas (N₂) and water (H₂O). The reaction is: NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g).\n*   **Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) decomposition:** The decomposition of ammonium nitrate is more complex and depends on the temperature. At temperatures between 185-200°C, it primarily decomposes into nitrous oxide (N₂O) and water. However, at higher temperatures or under certain conditions, it can undergo explosive decomposition to produce nitrogen (N₂), oxygen (O₂), and water (H₂O). The balanced equation for this reaction is: 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g).\n\nGiven that the products found in the experiment are N₂, O₂, and H₂O, it is clear that this second, more complete decomposition of ammonium nitrate occurred.\n\nThe step-by-step calculation was as follows:\n\n1.  **Determine moles of products:**\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g → 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol = 0.2 mol H₂O.\n    *   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g → 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol O₂.\n    *   Volume of Gas C (N₂) = 2.24 L at STP → 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol N₂.\n\n2.  **Set up reaction equations with an unknown molar amount 'n' for each salt:**\n    *   Salt A (NH₄NO₂): n NH₄NO₂ → n N₂ + 2n H₂O\n    *   Salt B (NH₄NO₃): n NH₄NO₃ → n N₂ + 0.5n O₂ + 2n H₂O (This is based on the 2:2:1:4 ratio from the balanced equation).\n\n3.  **Sum the products and equate to the experimental values:**\n    *   Total H₂O = 2n + 2n = 4n = 0.2 mol → n = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Total O₂ = 0.5n = 0.025 mol → n = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Total N₂ = n + n = 2n = 0.1 mol → n = 0.05 mol.\n    *   The value of n = 0.05 mol is consistent for all products.\n\n4.  **Verify the initial mass:**\n    *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.04 g/mol.\n    *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.04 g/mol.\n    *   Total mass = 0.05 mol * (64.04 g/mol + 80.04 g/mol) = 0.05 * 144.08 g = 7.204 g. This matches the given weight of 7.20 g.\n\n5.  **Calculate the total number of atoms:**\n    *   Salt A (NH₄NO₂): 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms.\n    *   Salt B (NH₄NO₃): 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms.\n    *   Total atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThe result is consistent and confirmed by the literature.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the experimental data to identify the products of decomposition.**\nThe problem states that a mixture of salts A and B was heated, decomposing completely into a mixture of gases. This gaseous mixture was then passed through a series of tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The weight of the tube increased by 3.60 g, which is the mass of the water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂. The problem states that the weight of this tube did not change. This is a crucial piece of information, indicating that no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition. This rules out salts containing anions like carbonate (CO₃²⁻).\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Red-hot copper is a reducing agent that reacts with oxidizing gases. In this context, it reacts with oxygen (O₂). The weight of the tube increased by 0.80 g, which corresponds to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 liters of a gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, one mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas did not react with the drying agent, the alkaline solution, or the hot copper. Given that the products include H₂O and O₂, the original salts likely contained H, O, and N. Therefore, Gas C is most likely nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the elemental composition of the original salt mixture.**\nFrom the products, we can calculate the total moles of each element present in the original 7.20 g mixture.\n*   Moles of Hydrogen (H) atoms = 2 × moles of H₂O = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   Moles of Nitrogen (N) atoms = 2 × moles of N₂ = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   Moles of Oxygen (O) atoms = (1 × moles of H₂O) + (2 × moles of O₂) = (1 × 0.20 mol) + (2 × 0.025 mol) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n\nThe molar ratio of the elements in the mixture is H : N : O = 0.40 : 0.20 : 0.25. To convert this to a simple integer ratio, we can multiply all values by 20:\nH : N : O = 8 : 4 : 5.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the individual salts A and B.**\nWe know the mixture is equimolar, meaning it contains an equal number of moles of salt A and salt B. The combined empirical formula for one unit of A plus one unit of B is H₈N₄O₅. Since the salts are composed of H, N, and O, they are likely ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing oxyanions.\nLet's test common salts:\n*   Ammonium nitrite: NH₄NO₂ (Formula: N₂H₄O₂)\n*   Ammonium nitrate: NH₄NO₃ (Formula: N₂H₄O₃)\n\nLet's sum the formulas of these two salts:\n(N₂H₄O₂) + (N₂H₄O₃) = N₄H₈O₅.\nThis perfectly matches the elemental ratio we derived. Therefore, salts A and B are ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the identification with stoichiometry and mass.**\nThe mixture is equimolar. Let 'n' be the number of moles of each salt.\nThe decomposition reactions that produce the observed products (N₂, O₂, H₂O) are:\n*   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)  (or per mole: NH₄NO₃ → N₂ + 0.5O₂ + 2H₂O)\n\nLet's calculate the expected moles of products from 'n' moles of each salt:\n*   Total H₂O = n(from NH₄NO₂) × 2 + n(from NH₄NO₃) × 2 = 4n\n*   Total N₂ = n(from NH₄NO₂) × 1 + n(from NH₄NO₃) × 1 = 2n\n*   Total O₂ = n(from NH₄NO₃) × 0.5 = 0.5n\n\nUsing our experimental values:\n*   From H₂O: 4n = 0.20 mol ⇒ n = 0.05 mol\n*   From N₂: 2n = 0.10 mol ⇒ n = 0.05 mol\n*   From O₂: 0.5n = 0.025 mol ⇒ n = 0.05 mol\nAll calculations yield n = 0.05 mol, confirming our hypothesis.\n\nFinally, let's check the total mass:\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.0 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.0 g/mol.\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol × 64.0 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 80.0 g/mol) = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass given in the problem.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total number of atoms.**\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B, which means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n*   Salt A (NH₄NO₂): 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = 8 atoms.\n*   Salt B (NH₄NO₃): 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = 9 atoms.\n*   Total number of atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe initial analysis appears to be correct. The search results confirm the decomposition products and reactions that were hypothesized.\n\n*   **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) Decomposition:** The thermal decomposition of ammonium nitrite produces nitrogen gas (N₂) and water (H₂O). The reaction is: NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O.\n*   **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃) Decomposition:** The decomposition of ammonium nitrate is more complex and depends on the temperature. At temperatures around 200-250°C, the primary products are nitrous oxide (N₂O) and water (H₂O). However, at higher temperatures or under certain conditions, it can decompose to produce nitrogen (N₂), oxygen (O₂), and water (H₂O). The problem specifies that O₂ was produced and passed over hot copper, and a final inert gas (deduced as N₂) remained. This indicates that the decomposition path producing O₂ and N₂ occurred: 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O.\n\nThe step-by-step chemical analysis based on the products formed is sound.\n\n1.  **Water (H₂O):** The mass increase of 3.60 g in the tube with anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂ corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n2.  **Oxygen (O₂):** The mass increase of 0.80 g in the tube with red-hot copper is due to the formation of CuO from O₂.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n3.  **Gas C (N₂):** The remaining 2.24 liters of gas at STP is the inert component.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol. This gas is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n4.  **Salts Identification:** The products (N₂, O₂, H₂O) strongly suggest the decomposition of ammonium salts containing nitrogen and oxygen. The two salts that fit this description and the stoichiometry are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\n5.  **Stoichiometric Verification:**\n    *   Let 'n' be the number of moles for each salt (equimolar mixture).\n    *   Reaction A: 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O\n    *   Reaction B: NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n    *   From 'n' moles of NH₄NO₃: (n/2) moles of O₂, n moles of N₂, and 2n moles of H₂O are produced.\n    *   From 'n' moles of NH₄NO₂: n moles of N₂ and 2n moles of H₂O are produced.\n    *   Total moles of O₂ = n/2 = 0.025 mol → n = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Total moles of N₂ = n + n = 2n = 0.1 mol → n = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Total moles of H₂O = 2n + 2n = 4n = 0.2 mol → n = 0.05 mol.\n    *   The calculated moles (n=0.05) are consistent for all products.\n\n6.  **Mass Verification:**\n    *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.04 g/mol.\n    *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.04 g/mol.\n    *   Total mass = 0.05 mol * (80.04 g/mol + 64.04 g/mol) = 0.05 * 144.08 = 7.204 g. This matches the initial mass of the mixture.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   Salt A is NH₄NO₃, which has 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 3(O) = 9 atoms.\n    *   Salt B is NH₄NO₂, which has 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 2(O) = 8 atoms.\n    *   The total number of atoms in both salts is 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nThe result is consistent and verified.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThe user wants me to solve a chemistry problem. I have already performed the reasoning and generated a Python script to verify the calculations. The script's output confirms my manual reasoning.\n\n**Summary of Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Identify Products and Moles:**\n    *   The mass increase of 3.60 g in the Mg(ClO₄)₂ tube corresponds to 3.60 g of H₂O. Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n    *   The mass increase of 0.80 g in the hot copper tube corresponds to 0.80 g of O₂. Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n    *   The remaining 2.24 L of gas at STP is an inert gas, identified as N₂. Moles of N₂ = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   The absence of mass change in the Ca(OH)₂ tube means no acidic gases (like CO₂, SO₂) were produced.\n\n2.  **Verify with Mass Conservation:**\n    *   Total mass of products = mass(H₂O) + mass(O₂) + mass(N₂)\n    *   Total mass = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + (0.10 mol * 28.0 g/mol) = 3.60 + 0.80 + 2.80 = 7.20 g.\n    *   This matches the initial mass of the mixture, confirming the products and their quantities are correct.\n\n3.  **Determine Elemental Composition of the Mixture:**\n    *   Moles of H = 2 * moles(H₂O) = 2 * 0.20 = 0.40 mol.\n    *   Moles of N = 2 * moles(N₂) = 2 * 0.10 = 0.20 mol.\n    *   Moles of O = 1 * moles(H₂O) + 2 * moles(O₂) = 0.20 + 2 * 0.025 = 0.25 mol.\n    *   The molar ratio of elements in the entire mixture is N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25. Multiplying by 20 gives an integer ratio of 4 : 8 : 5.\n\n4.  **Deduce Salt Formulas:**\n    *   The mixture is equimolar, so it contains 'n' moles of salt A and 'n' moles of salt B.\n    *   The combined formula for one unit of A and one unit of B is N₄H₈O₅.\n    *   The elements (N, H, O) suggest ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions.\n    *   Two ammonium ions (NH₄⁺), one for each salt, account for N₂H₈.\n    *   The remaining atoms for the two anions are (N₄H₈O₅) - (N₂H₈) = N₂O₅.\n    *   The two anions that sum to N₂O₅ are nitrite (NO₂⁻) and nitrate (NO₃⁻).\n    *   Therefore, the salts are A = NH₄NO₂ (Ammonium nitrite) and B = NH₄NO₃ (Ammonium nitrate).\n\n5.  **Calculate Total Atoms:**\n    *   Atoms in one formula unit of salt A (NH₄NO₂): 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 2(O) = 8 atoms.\n    *   Atoms in one formula unit of salt B (NH₄NO₃): 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 3(O) = 9 atoms.\n    *   Total number of atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThe code output confirms these calculations, showing a total of 17 atoms.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\n*   **Plan:**\n    1.

Identify the chemical nature of the gases produced and verify the composition by checking the mass balance.\n    3.  Deduce the identities of the two equimolar salts, A and B, that would decompose to form this specific mixture of gases.\n    4.  Count the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of salts A and B.\n\n*   **Action:** Calculate the moles of water (H₂O) absorbed, the moles of oxygen atoms that reacted with copper, and the moles of the final gas C.\n\n```python\n# Molar mass of H2O = 18.015 g/mol\n# Molar mass of O = 15.999 g/mol\n# Molar volume of a gas at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP) = 22.4 L/mol\n\n# Given data from the problem\nmass_increase_tube1 = 3.60  # g, corresponds to mass of H2O\nmass_increase_tube3 = 0.80    # g, corresponds to mass of O in CuO\nvolume_gas_C = 2.24  # L at STP\n\n# Calculate moles of each component\nmoles_H2O = mass_increase_tube1 / 18.015\nmoles_O_atoms = mass_increase_tube3 / 15.999\nmoles_gas_C = volume_gas_C / 22.4\n\nprint(f\"Moles of H2O = {moles_H2O:.4f} mol\")\nprint(f\"Moles of O atoms = {moles_O_atoms:.4f} mol\")\nprint(f\"Moles of gas C = {moles_gas_C:.4f} mol\")\n```\n\n*   **Result:**\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 0.1998 mol (approx. 0.20 mol)\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.0500 mol\n    *   Moles of gas C = 0.1000 mol\n\n*   **Plan Refinement:**\n    1.  The products are ~0.20 mol H₂O, an oxidizing gas that supplied 0.05 mol of O atoms, and 0.10 mol of an inert gas C. The inert gas C is likely N₂.\n    2.  The oxidizing gas reacted with hot copper (`Cu + [O] -> CuO`). A common nitrogen-based oxidizing gas from decomposition is N₂O. The reaction `N₂O + Cu -> N₂ + CuO` shows that 1 mole of N₂O provides 1 mole of O atoms. Therefore, the amount of N₂O must have been 0.05 mol.\n    3.  This reaction also produces 0.05 mol of N₂. The final gas C (0.10 mol N₂) is the sum of this produced N₂ and any N₂ present in the initial gas mixture. Therefore, initial N₂ = 0.10 mol (total) - 0.05 mol (from N₂O) = 0.05 mol.\n    4.  The initial gas mixture was: 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.05 mol N₂O, and 0.05 mol N₂. Let's verify this by checking if the total mass equals the starting 7.20 g.\n\n*   **Action:** Calculate the total mass of the deduced gas mixture (0.20 mol H₂O, 0.05 mol N₂O, 0.05 mol N₂).\n\n```python\n# Moles of each gas component (using rounded values for clarity)\nmoles_H2O = 0.20\nmoles_N2O = 0.05\nmoles_N2 = 0.05\n\n# Molar masses (g/mol)\nM_H2O = 18.015\nM_N2O = 44.013  # 2*14.007 + 15.999\nM_N2 = 28.014   # 2*14.007\n\n# Calculate the mass of each component and the total mass\nmass_H2O = moles_H2O * M_H2O\nmass_N2O = moles_N2O * M_N2O\nmass_N2 = moles_N2 * M_N2\ntotal_mass = mass_H2O + mass_N2O + mass_N2\n\nprint(f\"Calculated total mass = {total_mass:.2f} g\")\nprint(f\"Initial mass of salts = 7.20 g\")\n```\n\n*   **Result:**\n    *   Calculated total mass = 7.20 g\n    *   Initial mass of salts = 7.20 g\n    *   The mass balance is correct, confirming the identity and amounts of the gaseous products.\n\n*   **Plan Refinement:**\n    1.  We need to find two equimolar salts that decompose to yield 0.05 mol N₂, 0.05 mol N₂O, and 0.20 mol H₂O.\n    2.  The decomposition of ammonium nitrate (`NH₄NO₃ -> N₂O + 2H₂O`) and ammonium nitrite (`NH₄NO₂ -> N₂ + 2H₂O`) fit these products.\n    3.  If we have an equimolar mixture of `n` moles each, the products are `n` mol N₂O, `n` mol N₂, and `4n` mol H₂O. The molar ratio is 1:1:4.\n    4.  Our experimental results (0.05 mol N₂O : 0.05 mol N₂ : 0.20 mol H₂O) perfectly match the 1:1:4 ratio, with `n = 0.05` mol.\n    5.  Thus, the salts are NH₄NO₃ and NH₄NO₂. The final step is to count the atoms in their formulas.\n\n*   **Action:** Count the total number of atoms in the formulas NH₄NO₃ and NH₄NO₂.\n\n```python\n# Salt A is Ammonium Nitrate: NH4NO3\n# Number of atoms in NH4NO3 = 2 N + 4 H + 3 O\natoms_A = 2 + 4 + 3\n\n# Salt B is Ammonium Nitrite: NH4NO2\n# Number of atoms in NH4NO2 = 2 N + 4 H + 2 O\natoms_B = 2 + 4 + 2\n\n# Total number of atoms in both salt formulas\ntotal_atoms = atoms_A + atoms_B\n\nprint(f\"Atoms in NH4NO3 = {atoms_A}\")\nprint(f\"Atoms in NH4NO2 = {atoms_B}\")\nprint(f\"Total atoms = {total_atoms}\")\n```\n\n*   **Result:**\n    *   Atoms in NH₄NO₃ = 9\n    *   Atoms in NH₄NO₂ = 8\n    *   Total atoms = 17\n\n*   **Final Answer:** The logical deduction confirmed that the salts are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).

Analyze the Gas Separation Process**\n\n*   The mixture of gases from the decomposition is passed through a series of tubes to identify its components.\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a powerful drying agent that absorbs water. The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of the water (H₂O) produced.\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which reacts with acidic gases like CO₂ to form a precipitate (calcium carbonate), which would increase the tube's weight. Since the weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition.\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form black copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass increase of 0.80 g corresponds to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n*   **Gas C:** The remaining gas, measuring 2.24 liters at standard temperature and pressure (STP), is inert to the previous reagents. This volume corresponds to a specific number of moles.\n\n**2. Calculate the Moles of Each Gaseous Product**\n\n*   **Water (H₂O):**\n    *   Mass = 3.60 g\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol\n\n*   **Oxygen (O₂):**\n    *   Mass = 0.80 g\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol\n\n*   **Gas C:**\n    *   Volume = 2.24 L at STP\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol\n    *   Given that the original salts are nitrogen-based (a common feature of salts that decompose into gases), Gas C is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**3. Identify the Salts Based on Decomposition Products**\n\nWe need to find two nitrogen-containing salts that, when decomposed in an equimolar ratio, produce 0.2 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.1 mol N₂. Let's consider common ammonium salts.\n\n*   **Salt A: Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂)**\n    *   The thermal decomposition of ammonium nitrite produces nitrogen gas and water.\n    *   Reaction: NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n\n*   **Salt B: Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**\n    *   The decomposition of ammonium nitrate is complex and depends on temperature. At around 200°C, it typically produces N₂O and H₂O. However, a different decomposition pathway can occur, especially under certain conditions, that yields nitrogen, oxygen, and water.\n    *   Reaction: 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O\n\n**4. Verify the Molar Ratios and Mass**\n\nLet's assume the mixture contains 'x' moles of Salt A (NH₄NO₂) and 'x' moles of Salt B (NH₄NO₃). Based on the stoichiometry of their decomposition reactions:\n\n*   From **x mol of NH₄NO₂**: Produces **x mol of N₂** and **2x mol of H₂O**.\n*   From **x mol of NH₄NO₃**: Produces **x mol of N₂**, **(x/2) mol of O₂**, and **2x mol of H₂O**.\n\nNow, let's sum the total moles of each product:\n*   **Total N₂:** x + x = 2x\n*   **Total H₂O:** 2x + 2x = 4x\n*   **Total O₂:** x/2\n\nFrom our initial calculations, we know:\n*   Total N₂ = 0.1 mol\n*   Total H₂O = 0.2 mol\n*   Total O₂ = 0.025 mol\n\nLet's solve for 'x' using the products:\n*   2x = 0.1 mol  =>  x = 0.05 mol\n*   4x = 4 * 0.05 = 0.2 mol (This matches the H₂O produced)\n*   x/2 = 0.05 / 2 = 0.025 mol (This matches the O₂ produced)\n\nThe value x = 0.05 mol is consistent for all products. This confirms we have 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\n\nLet's check if the total mass matches the given 7.20 g.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.04 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.04 g/mol\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol * 64.04 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 80.04 g/mol)\n*   Total mass = 3.202 g + 4.002 g = 7.204 g\nThis matches the initial weight of the mixture.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to count the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of the two salts, A and B.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite - NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen (N) atoms\n    *   4 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n    *   2 Oxygen (O) atoms\n    *   Total: 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate - NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen (N) atoms\n    *   4 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n    *   3 Oxygen (O) atoms\n    *   Total: 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms\n\n*   **Total atoms in both salts = 8 + 9 = 17 atoms**\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the answer:\n\n**1. Analyze the products of the decomposition:**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a powerful drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed.\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The weight increase of 0.80 g is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = Mass / Atomic Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Since oxygen gas is diatomic (O₂), the moles of O₂ gas are 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas (at standard temperature and pressure - STP) remained.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n    *   This inert gas, in the context of decomposing nitrogen-containing salts, is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Identify the initial salts based on the products:**\n\nThe gaseous products are H₂O, O₂, and N₂. The original salts must contain the elements Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O). Common salts containing these elements are ammonium salts of nitrogen-based acids. Let's consider ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\n*   **Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** This salt decomposes to form nitrogen gas and water.\n    *   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Decomposition of Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** At high temperatures (the problem states 200°C), one of its decomposition pathways produces nitrogen, oxygen, and water.\n    *   2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\nThis set of reactions produces N₂, O₂, and H₂O, matching the experimental results.\n\n**3. Use stoichiometry to verify the salt identities:**\n\nLet's assume the initial equimolar mixture contained `x` moles of salt A (NH₄NO₂) and `x` moles of salt B (NH₄NO₃).\n\n*   **From `x` moles of NH₄NO₂:**\n    *   Produces `x` moles of N₂ and `2x` moles of H₂O.\n*   **From `x` moles of NH₄NO₃:**\n    *   Produces `x` moles of N₂ (from the 2:2 ratio), `0.5x` moles of O₂ (from the 2:1 ratio), and `2x` moles of H₂O (from the 2:4 ratio).\n\n**Total moles of products:**\n*   Total N₂ = `x` + `x` = `2x`\n*   Total H₂O = `2x` + `2x` = `4x`\n*   Total O₂ = `0.5x`\n\n**Now, let's use the moles calculated from the experimental data:**\n*   From O₂: `0.5x` = 0.025 mol  => `x` = 0.05 mol\n*   From H₂O: `4x` = 0.2 mol => `x` = 0.05 mol\n*   From N₂: `2x` = 0.1 mol => `x` = 0.05 mol\n\nThe value of `x` = 0.05 mol is consistent for all products, confirming that the mixture was 0.05 moles of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 moles of NH₄NO₃.\n\n**4. Verify the initial mass:**\n\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.04 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.05 g/mol\n*   Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 0.05 mol * 64.04 g/mol = 3.202 g\n*   Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 0.05 mol * 80.05 g/mol = 4.0025 g\n*   Total Mass = 3.202 g + 4.0025 g = 7.2045 g. This matches the given initial mass of 7.20 g.\n\n**5. Calculate the total number of atoms:**\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 2 Oxygen atoms. Total = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 3 Oxygen atoms. Total = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n**Total number of atoms in both salts = 8 + 9 = 17.**\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the total number of atoms in salts A and B.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Gaseous Products\n\nThe initial mixture of salts, weighing 7.20 g, was heated and decomposed completely into a mixture of gases. These gases were passed through a series of tubes, allowing us to identify and quantify them.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a powerful drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The weight of this tube increased by 3.60 g, which corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which reacts with acidic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂). Since the weight of this tube did not change, no CO₂ was produced during the decomposition. This indicates the absence of carbon in the original salts.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The weight increase of 0.80 g is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After passing through the three tubes, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas (at standard temperature and pressure) remained.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n\nThe total mass of the gaseous products (Water + Oxygen + Gas C) must equal the initial mass of the salts (7.20 g).\n*   Mass of Gas C = 7.20 g - 3.60 g (H₂O) - 0.80 g (O₂) = 2.80 g.\n*   Molar mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.1 mol = 28 g/mol.\n\nA gas with a molar mass of 28 g/mol that is unreactive under these conditions is nitrogen (N₂). Therefore, the decomposition products are H₂O, O₂, and N₂.\n\n### 2. Identify the Salts A and B\n\nThe elements present in the products are Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O). This means the original salts A and B must be composed of these elements. Given they are salts, a likely cation is ammonium (NH₄⁺), and the anions would be nitrogen-oxygen anions (oxyanions). The two most common such salts are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nLet's test the hypothesis that the equimolar mixture consists of Salt A = Ammonium Nitrite and Salt B = Ammonium Nitrate.\n\nThe thermal decomposition reactions are:\n*   **Ammonium Nitrite:** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Ammonium Nitrate:** 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\nLet 'n' be the number of moles for each salt in the equimolar mixture.\n\nFrom the decomposition of 'n' moles of each salt:\n*   **Total Moles of N₂:** n (from NH₄NO₂) + n (from NH₄NO₃) = 2n\n*   **Total Moles of H₂O:** 2n (from NH₄NO₂) + 2n (from NH₄NO₃) = 4n\n*   **Total Moles of O₂:** 0.5n (from NH₄NO₃)\n\nUsing the moles calculated from the experimental data:\n*   From O₂: 0.5n = 0.025 mol  => **n = 0.05 mol**\n*   Checking with N₂: 2n = 2 * 0.05 = 0.1 mol. This matches the experimental result.\n*   Checking with H₂O: 4n = 4 * 0.05 = 0.2 mol. This also matches the experimental result.\n\nThe value of n = 0.05 mol is consistent across all products, confirming that the salts are indeed ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms\n\nNow, we determine the number of atoms in one molecule of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite - NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   1 Nitrogen (N) + 4 Hydrogen (H) + 1 Nitrogen (N) + 2 Oxygen (O) = **8 atoms**\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate - NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   1 Nitrogen (N) + 4 Hydrogen (H) + 1 Nitrogen (N) + 3 Oxygen (O) = **9 atoms**\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is the sum of the atoms in each formula unit.\n*   Total Atoms = Atoms in Salt A + Atoms in Salt B = 8 + 9 = 17\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe analysis and code from the previous step have successfully identified the two salts and verified that they meet all the constraints of the problem.\n\n*   **Salt A:** Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂)\n    *   Number of atoms = 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n*   **Salt B:** Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)\n    *   Number of atoms = 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n*   **Total Atoms:** The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.\n    *   Total = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nProposer: The problem requires us to identify two salts, A and B, based on their decomposition products. The first step is to analyze the information from the three tubes and the remaining gas to determine the chemical composition and molar quantities of the gaseous products.\n\nSkeptic: This approach seems logical. However, we must be careful with our assumptions. The identity of gas C is not explicitly given, and the decomposition reactions of the initial salts can be complex and temperature-dependent. We need to ensure our deductions are consistent across all given data points (mass changes, gas volume, etc.).\n\nProposer: I will start by calculating the moles of the substances absorbed or reacted in each tube and the moles of the final gas C. This is a direct calculation from the data provided and involves no assumptions yet.\n\nProposer:\nBased on the search results and chemical principles, I can now determine the products of the reaction.\n\n1.  **Tube №1 (Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube absorbs water. The mass increase is 3.60 g.\n    *   The molar mass of water (H₂O) is approximately 18.015 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.015 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol.\n\n2.  **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂):** The weight did not change, which means no acidic gases like CO₂ were produced.\n\n3.  **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** This tube's weight increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of CuO. This mass increase corresponds to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 0.80 g.\n    *   The gas passing through would be molecular oxygen (O₂). The molar mass of an oxygen atom is ~16.00 g/mol, so the molar mass of O₂ is ~32.00 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n4.  **Gas C:** This is the remaining gas. Its volume is 2.24 L at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   The molar volume of any ideal gas at STP is 22.4 L/mol.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\nNow, I will determine the identity of Gas C by calculating its molar mass. The total initial mass was 7.20 g. By conservation of mass, this must equal the total mass of the products.\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of Gas C = Total Mass - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(O₂) = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n*   Molar Mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n\nA gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol that is inert in this series of reactions is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n\nSo, the decomposition produced:\n*   0.20 mol H₂O\n*   0.025 mol O₂\n*   0.10 mol N₂\n\nMy next step is to determine the empirical formula of the initial salt mixture from these products and then deduce the formulas of salts A and B.\n\nSkeptic:\nYour analysis of the products seems sound. The identification of Gas C as N₂ is well-supported. The crucial step is now identifying the two initial salts. You have the total elemental composition of the mixture (N, H, O), but you need to partition it into two distinct, equimolar salts that are chemically plausible. The decomposition reactions you will need to assume must also be plausible for the given conditions.\n\nProposer:\nI will now determine the total moles of each element (N, H, O) in the original mixture. From there, I will deduce the formulas of the two equimolar salts, A and B.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** From 0.20 mol H₂O -> 0.20 * 2 = 0.40 mol H.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** From 0.10 mol N₂ -> 0.10 * 2 = 0.20 mol N.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** From 0.20 mol H₂O + 0.025 mol O₂ -> (0.20 * 1) + (0.025 * 2) = 0.25 mol O.\n\nThe initial mixture contains 0.40 mol H, 0.20 mol N, and 0.25 mol O. Since salts A and B are in an equimolar mixture, let's say we have 'n' moles of A and 'n' moles of B. The total moles of N are 0.20, so 2n * (average N atoms per salt) = 0.20.\n\nLet's consider the simplest case where the total moles of salts are 0.10 mol (0.05 mol A + 0.05 mol B).\nThis would mean the total formula of the mixture (A+B) contains:\n*   N: 0.20 mol / 0.05 = 4\n*   H: 0.40 mol / 0.05 = 8\n*   O: 0.25 mol / 0.05 = 5\nSo, the combined formula is N₄H₈O₅.\n\nWe need to split N₄H₈O₅ into two plausible salts. Common salts containing these elements are ammonium salts. The NH₄⁺ ion accounts for NH₄.\n*   If we have two ammonium salts, we use 2 * NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈.\n*   The remaining atoms for the two anions are N₂O₅.\n*   The two most common oxyanions of nitrogen are nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻).\n*   NO₃⁻ + NO₂⁻ = N₂O₅.\n\nThis fits perfectly. So, the salts are:\n*   **Salt A:** NH₄NO₃ (Ammonium nitrate)\n*   **Salt B:** NH₄NO₂ (Ammonium nitrite)\n\nLet's check the decomposition reactions:\n*   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\nThe molar ratio of products from these reactions (N₂ : O₂ : H₂O) is (1+1) : (1/2) : (2+2) for every 1 mole of B and 1 mole of A (in the 2NH4NO3 form), which simplifies to 4 : 1 : 8.\nOur experimental molar ratio is N₂ : O₂ : H₂O = 0.10 : 0.025 : 0.20, which also simplifies to 4 : 1 : 8. The hypothesis is consistent.\n\nThe final step is to calculate the total number of atoms in the formulas of salts A and B.\n*   Salt A (NH₄NO₃): 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 3 O = 9 atoms.\n*   Salt B (NH₄NO₂): 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 2 O = 8 atoms.\n*   Total atoms = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nSkeptic:\nThe logic is consistent and all data points are accounted for. The assumed decomposition of ammonium nitrate to N₂, O₂, and H₂O is non-standard at 200°C, but within the context of a stoichiometry problem where the products are clearly defined by the analytical tests, this is a required inference. The conclusion seems solid.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
