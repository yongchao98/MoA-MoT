To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR and 1H NMR. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. A strong absorption peak is also observed at 1700 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum, none of which are correspond to vinyl-hydrogens. One of the signals in the 1H NMR is a doublet of triplets of quartets whilst a different signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Identify the compound as either, CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH, CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH, CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH, or CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH\n\nA) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH\nB) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH\nC) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH\nD) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound from the given choices, based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n**1. Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is the classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n*   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion:** The FTIR data confirms the compound has a carboxylic acid functional group. Since all four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, this data is confirmatory but does not help distinguish between the isomers. The deciding information must come from the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n**2. Analyze the ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe key to identifying the correct structure lies in the two highly specific and complex splitting patterns described. The multiplicity of a signal is determined by the number of adjacent, equivalent protons (`n`) according to the `n+1` rule.\n\n*   **\"No vinyl-hydrogens\"**: This confirms the molecule is saturated (contains no C=C double bonds), which is consistent with all four options.\n*   **Signal 1: \"Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)\"**: This means a single proton is being coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   **d**oublet: Coupled to **1** neighboring proton (a -CH- group).\n    *   **t**riplet: Coupled to **2** neighboring protons (a -CH₂- group).\n    *   **q**uartet: Coupled to **3** neighboring protons (a -CH₃ group).\n    *   Therefore, we must find a structure containing a proton with a set of neighbors: **{1H, 2H, 3H}**.\n*   **Signal 2: \"Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)\"**: This means a *different* single proton in the molecule is also coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   **d**oublet: Coupled to **1** neighboring proton (a -CH- group).\n    *   **t**riplet: Coupled to **2** neighboring protons (a -CH₂- group).\n    *   another **t**riplet: Coupled to another, non-equivalent group of **2** neighboring protons (a second -CH₂- group).\n    *   Therefore, we must find a structure containing a different proton with a set of neighbors: **{1H, 2H, 2H}**.\n\nThe correct structure must contain protons that satisfy **both** of these conditions simultaneously.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Candidate Structure**\n\nWe will now analyze each option to see if its structure can produce both of the required NMR signals.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    The proton at C3 is adjacent to a -CH group (H at C2), a -CH₂- group (at C4), and a -CH₃ group (on C3). This gives a **dtq** signal. However, there is no proton in this molecule that is adjacent to one -CH group and two different -CH₂- groups. It cannot produce a `dtt` signal.\n    *   **Result: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    The proton at C3 is adjacent to a -CH group (H at C2), a -CH₂- group (at C4), and the -CH₂- of its ethyl substituent. This gives a **dtt** signal. However, no proton in this molecule is adjacent to a -CH, a -CH₂, *and* a -CH₃ group. It cannot produce a `dtq` signal.\n    *   **Result: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    The proton at C3 is adjacent to a -CH group (H at C4), a -CH₂- group (at C2), and a -CH₃ group (on C3). This gives a **dtq** signal. However, this molecule only has one -CH₂- group, making it impossible to produce a `dtt` signal which requires two different -CH₂- neighbors for a single proton.\n    *   **Result: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    Let's analyze the two methine (-CH-) protons in this structure: `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(Et)-CH(4)(Et)-CH₃(5)`.\n    *   **Proton at C4:** This proton is adjacent to:\n        1.  The proton at C3 (**1H**, gives a **doublet**).\n        2.  The protons of the ethyl group's -CH₂- on C4 (**2H**, gives a **triplet**).\n        3.  The protons of the methyl group at C5 (**3H**, gives a **quartet**).\n        The resulting signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This perfectly matches one of the observed signals.\n    *   **Proton at C3:** This proton is adjacent to:\n        1.  The proton at C4 (**1H**, gives a **doublet**).\n        2.  The protons of the -CH₂- group at C2 (**2H**, gives a **triplet**).\n        3.  The protons of the ethyl group's -CH₂- on C3 (**2H**, gives another **triplet**).\n        The resulting signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This perfectly matches the second observed signal.\n    *   **Result: Correct.** This is the only structure that has protons matching both complex NMR splitting patterns.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound based on the provided spectroscopic data and candidate answers.\n\n### **1. Deconstruction of the Spectroscopic Data**\n\nThe first step is to interpret the meaning of each piece of spectroscopic evidence.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a definitive signal for the O-H stretch of a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is a key identifier.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is a characteristic signal for the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. This confirms the functional group present in all four options but does not help distinguish between them.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This confirms the molecule is saturated (lacks C=C double bonds), which is consistent with all four candidate structures.\n    *   **Signal 1: A \"doublet of triplets of quartets\" (dtq).** This highly specific splitting pattern reveals the neighboring proton environment of one specific proton in the molecule. For a signal to be a `dtq`, the corresponding proton must be coupled to three different, non-equivalent groups of protons:\n        *   One neighboring proton (-CH-), causing the **doublet**.\n        *   Two neighboring protons (-CH₂-), causing the **triplet**.\n        *   Three neighboring protons (-CH₃), causing the **quartet**.\n        We are looking for a proton whose neighbors consist of the set {1H, 2H, 3H}.\n    *   **Signal 2: A \"doublet of triplets of triplets\" (dtt).** This indicates that a *different* proton in the molecule is also coupled to three different sets of neighbors:\n        *   One neighboring proton (-CH-), causing the **doublet**.\n        *   Two neighboring protons (-CH₂-), causing a **triplet**.\n        *   Another, chemically non-equivalent group of two protons (-CH₂-), causing a second **triplet**.\n        We are looking for a second, distinct proton whose neighbors consist of the set {1H, 2H, 2H}.\n\nThe core task is to find the one structure from the options that contains protons matching **both** of these environments.\n\n### **2. Systematic Evaluation of Each Candidate Structure**\n\nWe will now analyze the structure of each option to see if it can produce both the `dtq` and `dtt` signals.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    *   The proton at C3 is adjacent to a -CH- group (at C2), a -CH₂- group (at C4), and a -CH₃- group (on C3). This environment ({1H, 2H, 3H}) would give a `dtq` signal.\n    *   However, no proton in this molecule is adjacent to one -CH- group and two different -CH₂- groups. Therefore, it **cannot** produce a `dtt` signal. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n    *   The proton at C3 is adjacent to a -CH- group (at C2), a -CH₂- group (at C4), and the -CH₂- of its ethyl substituent. This environment ({1H, 2H, 2H}) would give a `dtt` signal.\n    *   However, no proton in this molecule is adjacent to a -CH- group, a -CH₂- group, and a -CH₃- group simultaneously. Therefore, it **cannot** produce a `dtq` signal. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    *   The proton at C3 is adjacent to a -CH- group (at C4), a -CH₂- group (at C2), and a -CH₃- group (on C3). This environment ({1H, 2H, 3H}) would give a `dtq` signal.\n    *   However, this molecule only contains one -CH₂- group, making it impossible for any proton to be coupled to two different -CH₂- groups. Therefore, it **cannot** produce a `dtt` signal. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\n    Let's analyze the two methine protons in this structure: `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(Et)-CH(4)(Et)-CH₃(5)`\n    *   **Proton at C4:** This proton is adjacent to three different groups:\n        1.  The proton at C3 (1H) → causes a **doublet**.\n        2.  The protons of the terminal methyl group at C5 (3H) → causes a **quartet**.\n        3.  The protons of the methylene (-CH₂-) part of its ethyl substituent (2H) → causes a **triplet**.\n        This proton's signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This perfectly matches the first required signal.\n    *   **Proton at C3:** This proton is adjacent to three different groups:\n        1.  The proton at C4 (1H) → causes a **doublet**.\n        2.  The protons of the methylene group at C2 (2H) → causes a **triplet**.\n        3.  The protons of the methylene (-CH₂-) part of its ethyl substituent (2H) → causes another **triplet**.\n        This proton's signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This perfectly matches the second required signal.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe structure of **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**, which corresponds to the formula `CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH`, is the only candidate that possesses the exact structural features required to produce both a `dtq` signal and a `dtt` signal in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound by synthesizing the provided reasoning from other agents.\n\n**1.

The ¹H NMR data, specifically the complex splitting patterns, are the key to the solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n**1. Analyze the FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is the classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, which is also characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion:** The FTIR data confirms that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) contain a carboxylic acid functional group, so this data is consistent with all of them but does not help to differentiate between them.\n\n**2. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nThe crucial information for identifying the correct isomer lies in the complex splitting patterns described. According to the n+1 rule, a proton's signal is split by its neighboring protons.\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This confirms the molecule is saturated (contains no C=C double bonds), which is true for all four options.\n*   **Signal 1: A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This indicates a single proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One adjacent proton (a -CH- group), which causes the **doublet (d)** splitting.\n    *   Two adjacent protons (a -CH₂- group), which cause the **triplet (t)** splitting.\n    *   Three adjacent protons (a -CH₃ group), which cause the **quartet (q)** splitting.\n    *   Therefore, we must find a proton in the structure with a neighboring environment of **{1H, 2H, 3H}**.\n*   **Signal 2: A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This indicates that a *different* single proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One adjacent proton (a -CH- group), which causes the **doublet (d)** splitting.\n    *   Two adjacent protons (a -CH₂- group), which cause the first **triplet (t)** splitting.\n    *   A second, non-equivalent group of two adjacent protons (another -CH₂- group), which causes the second **triplet (t)** splitting.\n    *   Therefore, we must find a different proton with a neighboring environment of **{1H, 2H, 2H}**.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Candidate Structure**\n\nWe will now systematically analyze each of the four proposed structures to see if it contains protons that match **both** the `dtq` and `dtt` environments.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    The proton at C3 is adjacent to H at C2 (1H), the CH₂ at C4 (2H), and its own CH₃ group (3H). This creates a {1H, 2H, 3H} environment, which would give a `dtq` signal. However, no proton in this molecule is adjacent to one CH group and two different CH₂ groups, so it cannot produce a `dtt` signal. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n    The proton at C3 is adjacent to H at C2 (1H), the CH₂ at C4 (2H), and the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H). This creates a {1H, 2H, 2H} environment, which would give a `dtt` signal. However, no proton in the molecule has the {1H, 2H, 3H} neighborhood required for a `dtq` signal. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    The proton at C3 is adjacent to H at C4 (1H), the CH₂ at C2 (2H), and its own CH₃ group (3H). This would give a `dtq` signal. However, this molecule only contains one CH₂ group, so it is impossible for any proton to have two different CH₂ neighbors to produce a `dtt` signal. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\n    Let's analyze the two central methine (-CH-) protons in this structure, numbering the main chain from the COOH group: `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(Et)-CH(4)(Et)-CH₃(5)`\n\n    *   **Proton at C4:** This proton has three different neighboring groups:\n        1.  The proton at C3 (1H) → creates a **doublet**.\n        2.  The CH₂ group of its ethyl substituent (2H) → creates a **triplet**.\n        3.  The CH₃ group at C5 (3H) → creates a **quartet**.\n        The combined signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This perfectly matches the first required signal.\n\n    *   **Proton at C3:** This proton also has three different neighboring groups:\n        1.  The proton at C4 (1H) → creates a **doublet**.\n        2.  The CH₂ group at C2 (2H) → creates a **triplet**.\n        3.  The CH₂ group of its ethyl substituent (2H) → creates another **triplet**.\n        The combined signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This perfectly matches the second required signal.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe structure of **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**, which corresponds to the formula in option D, is the only candidate that contains protons matching both the \"doublet of triplets of quartets\" and \"doublet of triplets of triplets\" descriptions from the ¹H NMR data.

The significant broadening is a key indicator.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, which is also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion:** The FTIR data confirms that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. Since all four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, this data is consistent with all of them but does not help to distinguish between the isomers. The deciding information must come from the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nThe crucial information lies in the complex splitting patterns, which describe the number of protons on adjacent carbons.

This creates a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This perfectly matches the second signal.\n    *Verdict: Correct.* This is the only structure that can produce both of the described complex ¹H NMR signals.\n\n**Final Decision**\nThe analysis of the provided agent answers reveals a strong consensus in the chemical reasoning: the structure of 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid is the only one that fits the NMR data. While some agents may have listed an incorrect final letter due to scrambled options, their correct analytical steps overwhelmingly support this conclusion.

All four chemical structures provided are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data confirms the functional group class but is insufficient to distinguish between the isomers.\n\n### **Step 2: Interpretation of ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe crucial information for identifying the correct isomer lies in the complex proton splitting patterns.\n*   **\"No vinyl-hydrogens\"**: This confirms the molecule is saturated (lacks C=C double bonds), which is consistent with all four structures.\n*   **\"A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)\"**: This means a single proton's signal is being split by three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   **d**oublet: coupled to **1** neighboring proton (a `-CH-` group).\n    *   **t**riplet: coupled to **2** neighboring protons (a `-CH₂-` group).\n    *   **q**uartet: coupled to **3** neighboring protons (a `-CH₃` group).\n    *   We need to find a methine proton with the neighboring environment: {1H, 2H, 3H}.\n*   **\"A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)\"**: This means a *different* single proton is being split by three other sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   **d**oublet: coupled to **1** neighboring proton (a `-CH-` group).\n    *   **t**riplet: coupled to **2** neighboring protons (a `-CH₂-` group).\n    *   **t**riplet: coupled to another, non-equivalent group of **2** neighboring protons (a second `-CH₂-` group).\n    *   We need to find a different methine proton with the neighboring environment: {1H, 2H, 2H}.\n\n**Conclusion:** The correct structure must contain protons that generate **both** a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluation of Candidate Structures**\n\nLet's systematically analyze each option as listed in the question.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   The proton at C3 is adjacent to a `-CH-` group (at C2), a `-CH₂-` group (at C4), and a `-CH₃` group (on C3).

As correctly pointed out by some agents, the IUPAC name for this structure is **3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**.\n    *   **Proton at C4:** This proton is adjacent to three groups of protons:\n        1.  The `-CH-` group at C3 (**1H**, gives a **doublet**).\n        2.  The `-CH₂-` group of the ethyl substituent on C4 (**2H**, gives a **triplet**).\n        3.  The `-CH₃` group at C5 (**3H**, gives a **quartet**).\n        *   This creates a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)** signal, matching the first NMR signal.\n    *   **Proton at C3:** This proton is adjacent to three different groups of protons:\n        1.

Therefore, it is the only structure consistent with all of the provided evidence.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis problem requires a detailed analysis of spectroscopic data to distinguish between four isomers. Here is a systematic breakdown of the reasoning process, drawing upon the consensus points from the provided answers.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Data\nThe initial information comes from the Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum.\n*   **A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹**: This is a classic and definitive signal for the O-H stretching vibration of a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH). The significant broadness is a key characteristic.\n*   **A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹**: This corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, with a frequency typical for a saturated carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion**: The FTIR data unambiguously identify the unknown compound as a carboxylic acid. All four provided options are carboxylic acids, so this confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the isomers. The deciding information must come from the NMR data.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Data\nThe proton nuclear magnetic resonance (¹H NMR) data provides information about the local electronic environment and neighboring protons for each unique proton in the molecule. This is the key to differentiating the isomers.\n*   **\"No vinyl-hydrogens\"**: This confirms the molecule is saturated (contains no C=C double bonds), which is consistent with all four structural options.\n*   **Signal 1: A \"doublet of triplets of quartets\" (dtq)**: This complex splitting pattern means a single proton is coupled to three different, non-equivalent sets of neighboring protons. Using the `n+1` rule:\n    *   The **doublet (d)** results from coupling to **one** adjacent proton (-CH-).\n    *   The **triplet (t)** results from coupling to **two** adjacent protons (-CH₂-).\n    *   The **quartet (q)** results from coupling to **three** adjacent protons (-CH₃).\n    *   Therefore, we must find a methine (-CH-) proton that is directly bonded to another CH group, a CH₂ group, and a CH₃ group.\n*   **Signal 2: A \"doublet of triplets of triplets\" (dtt)**: This indicates that a *different* proton in the molecule is also coupled to three different sets of neighbors:\n    *   The **doublet (d)** results from coupling to **one** adjacent proton (-CH-).\n    *   The first **triplet (t)** results from coupling to **two** adjacent protons (-CH₂-).\n    *   The second **triplet (t)** results from coupling to another, non-equivalent group of **two** protons (a second -CH₂- group).\n    *   Therefore, we must find a methine (-CH-) proton that is directly bonded to another CH group and two different CH₂ groups.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Each Candidate Structure\nThe goal is to find the single structure that contains protons matching **both** the `dtq` and `dtt` environments.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   The proton at C3 is adjacent to a -CH- group (at C2), a -CH₂- group (at C4), and a -CH₃- group (on C3). This environment **would produce a dtq signal**.\n    *   However, no proton in this molecule is adjacent to a -CH- group and two different -CH₂- groups. It **cannot produce a dtt signal**. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   The proton at C3 is adjacent to a -CH- group (at C2), a -CH₂- group (at C4), and the -CH₂- of its ethyl substituent. This environment **would produce a dtt signal**.\n    *   However, no proton is adjacent to a -CH-, a -CH₂-, and a -CH₃- group simultaneously. It **cannot produce a dtq signal**. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   The proton at C3 is adjacent to a -CH- group (at C4), a -CH₂- group (at C2), and a -CH₃- group (on C3). This environment **would produce a dtq signal**.\n    *   However, the molecule only has one -CH₂- group, making it impossible for any proton to be coupled to two different -CH₂- groups. It **cannot produce a dtt signal**. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid)**\n    *   First, we determine the correct structure from the condensed formula: `CH₃ - CH(Et) - CH(Et) - CH₂ - COOH`. The longest chain containing the COOH group is a hexanoic acid chain, giving the IUPAC name 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid. Let's analyze its key methine protons.\n    `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(Et)-CH(4)(Me)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`\n    *   **Proton at C4**: This proton is adjacent to:\n        1.  The proton at C3 (1H) → a **doublet**.\n        2.  The methylene group at C5 (2H) → a **triplet**.\n        3.  The methyl group attached at C4 (3H) → a **quartet**.\n        *   This creates a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)** signal, perfectly matching the first requirement.\n    *   **Proton at C3**: This proton is adjacent to:\n        1.  The proton at C4 (1H) → a **doublet**.\n        2.  The methylene group at C2 (2H) → a **triplet**.\n        3.  The methylene group of the ethyl substituent on C3 (2H) → a second **triplet**.\n        *   This creates a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)** signal, perfectly matching the second requirement.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe structure corresponding to the formula `CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH` is the only candidate that possesses the exact proton environments necessary to produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal in the ¹H NMR spectrum.

Analysis of FTIR Data**\n*   **Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ and strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** These two signals are classic hallmarks of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) functional group. The broad peak is the O-H stretch, and the strong peak is the C=O stretch.\n*   **Conclusion:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid.

All four options are carboxylic acids, so this data confirms the functional group class but does not differentiate between the isomers.\n\n**2. Analyze the ¹H NMR Data:**\n\nThe crucial information lies in the complex splitting patterns, which describe the number and type of protons on adjacent carbons. According to the n+1 rule, a proton's signal is split into n+1 peaks by 'n' equivalent neighboring protons.\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This confirms the molecule is saturated (has no C=C double bonds), which is consistent with all four options.\n*   **Signal 1: A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This highly specific pattern means a single proton is being coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   Coupling to **one** adjacent proton (-CH-), causing the **d**oublet.\n    *   Coupling to **two** adjacent, equivalent protons (-CH₂-), causing the **t**riplet.\n    *   Coupling to **three** adjacent, equivalent protons (-CH₃-), causing the **q**uartet.\n    In summary, we need to find a proton with a set of neighbors containing {1H, 2H, 3H}.\n\n*   **Signal 2: A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This indicates a different proton is also coupled to three different sets of neighbors:\n    *   Coupling to **one** adjacent proton (-CH-), causing the **d**oublet.\n    *   Coupling to **two** adjacent, equivalent protons (-CH₂-), causing a **t**riplet.\n    *   Coupling to another, chemically non-equivalent set of two protons (-CH₂-), causing a second **t**riplet.\n    In summary, we need to find a proton with a set of neighbors containing {1H, 2H, 2H}.\n\nThe goal is to find the **one structure** that contains protons responsible for **both** of these signals.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Candidate Structure:**\n\nWe will now systematically analyze each structure to see which one fits the NMR data.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    The methine proton at C3 is adjacent to a methine proton (H at C2), a methylene group (at C4), and a methyl group. Its neighbors are {1H, 2H, 3H}, which would produce a `dtq` signal. However, no proton in this molecule is adjacent to one methine proton and two different methylene groups. It **cannot** produce a `dtt` signal. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n    The methine proton at C3 is adjacent to a methine proton (H at C2), a methylene group (at C4), and the methylene group of its ethyl substituent. Its neighbors are {1H, 2H, 2H}, which would produce a `dtt` signal. However, no proton in this molecule has the {1H, 2H, 3H} set of neighbors required for a `dtq` signal. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    The methine proton at C3 is adjacent to a methine proton (H at C4), a methylene group (at C2), and a methyl group. Its neighbors are {1H, 2H, 3H}, which would produce a `dtq` signal. However, like option A, it lacks the environment to produce a `dtt` signal as there is only one CH₂ group. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\n    Let's analyze the two central methine (-CH-) protons in this structure, numbering the chain from the acid: `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(Et)-CH(4)(Et)-CH₃(5)`\n    *   **Proton at C4:** This proton's neighbors are the H at C3 (1H), the CH₃ at C5 (3H), and the CH₂ of its ethyl substituent (2H). Its neighboring environment is **{1H, 2H, 3H}**. This will produce a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This perfectly matches the first required signal.\n    *   **Proton at C3:** This proton's neighbors are the H at C4 (1H), the CH₂ at C2 (2H), and the CH₂ of its ethyl substituent (2H). Its neighboring environment is **{1H, 2H, 2H}**. This will produce a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This perfectly matches the second required signal.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis is the only structure that possesses two distinct proton environments that match both the `dtq` and `dtt` splitting patterns described in the ¹H NMR data. Therefore, it is the correct identification for the unknown compound.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThis is a spectroscopy problem requiring a systematic analysis of the provided data to distinguish between four isomers. Here is a breakdown of the reasoning process.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Data\n*   **Broad Absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is the classic signature of an O-H bond stretch in a hydrogen-bonded system, which is characteristic of carboxylic acids.\n*   **Strong Absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is a definitive peak for a C=O (carbonyl) bond stretch, with the frequency being typical for a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion:** The FTIR data confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). Since all four candidate structures (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, this information confirms the compound class but does not differentiate between the isomers. The definitive answer must come from the ¹H NMR data.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Data\nThe key to solving the problem lies in understanding the complex splitting patterns, which describe the proton's local environment. This is governed by the n+1 rule, where a signal is split into n+1 peaks by 'n' equivalent neighboring protons.\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This confirms the molecule is saturated (has no C=C double bonds), which is consistent with all four options.\n*   **Signal 1: A \"doublet of triplets of quartets\" (dtq):** This highly specific pattern means a single proton is being split by three different, non-equivalent groups of neighboring protons:\n    *   One adjacent proton (-CH-) causes the **doublet (d)**.\n    *   Two adjacent protons (-CH₂-) cause the **triplet (t)**.\n    *   Three adjacent protons (-CH₃) cause the **quartet (q)**.\n    Therefore, we need to find a methine proton (-CH-) in the structure that is simultaneously adjacent to a -CH group, a -CH₂- group, and a -CH₃ group.\n*   **Signal 2: A \"doublet of triplets of triplets\" (dtt):** This indicates that a *different* proton in the molecule is also split by three non-equivalent groups of neighbors:\n    *   One adjacent proton (-CH-) causes the **doublet (d)**.\n    *   Two adjacent protons (-CH₂-) cause one **triplet (t)**.\n    *   A second, different group of two adjacent protons (another -CH₂-) causes the second **triplet (t)**.\n    Therefore, we must find a second methine proton (-CH-) that is simultaneously adjacent to a -CH group and two different -CH₂- groups.\n\nThe task is to find the **single structure** that contains protons that can generate **both** of these unique signals.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Each Candidate Structure Systematically\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    The proton at C3 is adjacent to the proton at C2 (1H), the -CH₂- group at C4 (2H), and its own methyl substituent (3H). This environment `{1H, 2H, 3H}` would produce a `dqt` (or `dtq`) signal. However, this molecule lacks a proton adjacent to one -CH- and two different -CH₂- groups. Thus, it cannot produce a `dtt` signal. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n    The proton at C3 is adjacent to the proton at C2 (1H), the -CH₂- group at C4 (2H), and the -CH₂- of its ethyl substituent (2H). This environment `{1H, 2H, 2H}` would produce a `dtt` signal. However, there is no proton in the molecule that has neighbors of `{1H, 2H, 3H}`. Thus, it cannot produce a `dtq` signal. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    The proton at C3 is adjacent to the proton at C4 (1H), the -CH₂- group at C2 (2H), and its own methyl substituent (3H). This environment `{1H, 2H, 3H}` would produce a `dqt` (or `dtq`) signal. However, like option A, it lacks the necessary environment to produce a `dtt` signal. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\n    Let's draw this structure and analyze the two key methine protons.\n    `HOOC(1) - CH₂(2) - CH(3)(Et) - CH(4)(Et) - CH₃(5)`\n    *   **Proton at C4:** It is adjacent to three different groups: the proton at C3 (1H), the methyl group at C5 (3H), and the methylene group of its ethyl substituent (2H). Its set of neighbors is `{1H, 2H, 3H}`. This environment will produce a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**, perfectly matching Signal 1.\n    *   **Proton at C3:** It is adjacent to three different groups: the proton at C4 (1H), the methylene group at C2 (2H), and the methylene group of its ethyl substituent (2H). Its set of neighbors is `{1H, 2H, 2H}`. This environment will produce a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**, perfectly matching Signal 2.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe structure of **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**, which corresponds to the formula `CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH`, is the only candidate that contains two different protons whose environments perfectly match the requirements to produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal in the ¹H NMR spectrum.

For a signal to be a `dtq`, the corresponding proton must be coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   **d**oublet: Coupled to **1** neighboring proton (a -CH- group).\n        *   **t**riplet: Coupled to **2** neighboring protons (a -CH₂- group).\n        *   **q**uartet: Coupled to **3** neighboring protons (a -CH₃ group).\n        *   **Requirement #1:** We must find a structure containing a proton with a set of neighbors: `{1H, 2H, 3H}`.\n    *   **Signal 2: A \"doublet of triplets of triplets\" (dtt).** This indicates a *different* proton in the molecule is also coupled to three different sets of neighbors:\n        *   **d**oublet: Coupled to **1** neighboring proton (a -CH- group).\n        *   **t**riplet: Coupled to **2** neighboring protons (a -CH₂- group).\n        *   another **t**riplet: Coupled to another, non-equivalent group of **2** protons (a second -CH₂- group).\n        *   **Requirement #2:** We must find a second, distinct proton with a set of neighbors: `{1H, 2H, 2H}`.\n\n### **2.

This fulfills **Requirement #1 (dtq)**.\n    *   However, this molecule only has one `-CH₂-` group in total, making it impossible for any proton to be coupled to two different `-CH₂-` groups. It fails **Requirement #2 (dtt)**.\n    *   **Conclusion: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   Let's analyze the two methine (-CH-) protons in this structure, numbering the chain from the COOH group: `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(Et)-CH(4)(Et)-CH₃(5)`\n    *   **Proton at C4**: This proton's signal is split by its neighbors: the proton at C3 (1H, causing a **doublet**), the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H, causing a **triplet**), and the CH₃ group at C5 (3H, causing a **quartet**). This `{1H, 2H, 3H}` environment creates the **dtq** signal. **Requirement #1 is met.**\n    *   **Proton at C3**: This proton's signal is split by its neighbors: the proton at C4 (1H, causing a **doublet**), the CH₂ group at C2 (2H, causing a **triplet**), and the CH₂ of its own ethyl group (2H, causing another **triplet**).

Analyze the FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is the classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, which is also characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion:** The FTIR data confirms that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid.

Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nThe crucial information for identifying the correct isomer lies in the complex splitting patterns described.

Evaluate Each Candidate Structure**\n\nWe will now systematically analyze each of the four proposed structures to see if it contains protons that match **both** the `dtq` and `dtt` environments.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    The proton at C3 is adjacent to H at C2 (1H), the CH₂ at C4 (2H), and its own CH₃ group (3H). This creates a {1H, 2H, 3H} environment, which would give a `dtq` signal. However, no proton in this molecule is adjacent to one CH group and two different CH₂ groups, so it cannot produce a `dtt` signal. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n    The proton at C3 is adjacent to H at C2 (1H), the CH₂ at C4 (2H), and the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H). This creates a {1H, 2H, 2H} environment, which would give a `dtt` signal. However, no proton in the molecule has the {1H, 2H, 3H} neighborhood required for a `dtq` signal. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    The proton at C3 is adjacent to H at C4 (1H), the CH₂ at C2 (2H), and its own CH₃ group (3H). This would give a `dtq` signal. However, this molecule only contains one CH₂ group, so it is impossible for any proton to have two different CH₂ neighbors to produce a `dtt` signal. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\n    Let's analyze the two central methine (-CH-) protons in this structure, numbering the main chain from the COOH group: `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(Et)-CH(4)(Et)-CH₃(5)`\n\n    *   **Proton at C4:** This proton has three different neighboring groups:\n        1.  The proton at C3 (1H) → creates a **doublet**.\n        2.  The CH₂ group of its ethyl substituent (2H) → creates a **triplet**.\n        3.  The CH₃ group at C5 (3H) → creates a **quartet**.\n        The combined signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This perfectly matches the first required signal.\n\n    *   **Proton at C3:** This proton also has three different neighboring groups:\n        1.  The proton at C4 (1H) → creates a **doublet**.\n        2.  The CH₂ group at C2 (2H) → creates a **triplet**.\n        3.  The CH₂ group of its ethyl substituent (2H) → creates another **triplet**.\n        The combined signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This perfectly matches the second required signal.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe structure of **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**, which corresponds to the formula in option D, is the only candidate that contains protons matching both the \"doublet of triplets of quartets\" and \"doublet of triplets of triplets\" descriptions from the ¹H NMR data.

The significant broadening is a key indicator.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, which is also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion:** The FTIR data confirms that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. Since all four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, this data is consistent with all of them but does not help to distinguish between the isomers. The deciding information must come from the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nThe crucial information lies in the complex splitting patterns, which describe the number of protons on adjacent carbons. This is governed by the n+1 rule.\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This confirms that the molecule is saturated (contains no C=C double bonds), which is true for all four options.\n*   **Signal 1: \"doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)\"**: This means a single proton is being split by three different groups of neighboring protons:\n    *   Coupling to **one** adjacent proton (a `-CH-` group) results in a **d**oublet.\n    *   Coupling to **two** adjacent protons (a `-CH₂-` group) results in a **t**riplet.\n    *   Coupling to **three** adjacent protons (a `-CH₃` group) results in a **q**uartet.\n    *   Therefore, we must find a proton in the structure with a neighbor set of `{1H, 2H, 3H}`.\n*   **Signal 2: \"doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)\"**: This means a different proton in the molecule is split by three different groups of neighbors:\n    *   Coupling to **one** adjacent proton (a `-CH-` group) results in a **d**oublet.\n    *   Coupling to **two** adjacent protons (a `-CH₂-` group) results in a **t**riplet.\n    *   Coupling to a second, non-equivalent group of **two** adjacent protons (another `-CH₂-` group) results in another **t**riplet.\n    *   Therefore, we must find another proton in the structure with a neighbor set of `{1H, 2H, 2H}`.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate Each Candidate Structure**\n\nThe final step is to find the *single* structure that contains protons matching **both** of these complex splitting environments.

It is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\n    Let's analyze the two central methine (-CH-) protons in this structure: `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(Et)-CH(4)(Et)-CH₃(5)`.\n    *   **Proton at C4**: Its signal is split by its neighbors: the proton at C3 (1H, **doublet**), the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H, **triplet**), and the CH₃ group at C5 (3H, **quartet**). This gives the required **`dtq`** signal.\n    *   **Proton at C3**: Its signal is split by its neighbors: the proton at C4 (1H, **doublet**), the CH₂ group at C2 (2H, **triplet**), and the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H, another **triplet**). This gives the required **`dtt`** signal.\n\nThis is the only structure that possesses two different protons whose environments perfectly match the requirements to produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the provided information and candidate responses.\n\n**1.

Here is a systematic breakdown of the reasoning process, drawing upon the consensus points from the provided answers.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Data\nThe initial information comes from the Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum.\n*   **A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹**: This is a classic and definitive signal for the O-H stretching vibration of a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH). The significant broadness is a key characteristic.\n*   **A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹**: This corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, with a frequency typical for a saturated carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion**: The FTIR data unambiguously identify the unknown compound as a carboxylic acid. All four provided options are carboxylic acids, so this confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the isomers. The deciding information must come from the NMR data.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Data\nThe proton nuclear magnetic resonance (¹H NMR) data provides information about the local electronic environment and neighboring protons for each unique proton in the molecule. This is the key to differentiating the isomers.\n*   **\"No vinyl-hydrogens\"**: This confirms the molecule is saturated (contains no C=C double bonds), which is consistent with all four structural options.\n*   **Signal 1: A \"doublet of triplets of quartets\" (dtq)**: This complex splitting pattern means a single proton is coupled to three different, non-equivalent sets of neighboring protons.

The longest chain containing the COOH group is a hexanoic acid chain, giving the IUPAC name 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid. Let's analyze its key methine protons.\n    `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(Et)-CH(4)(Me)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`\n    *   **Proton at C4**: This proton is adjacent to:\n        1.  The proton at C3 (1H) → a **doublet**.\n        2.  The methylene group at C5 (2H) → a **triplet**.\n        3.  The methyl group attached at C4 (3H) → a **quartet**.\n        *   This creates a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)** signal, perfectly matching the first requirement.\n    *   **Proton at C3**: This proton is adjacent to:\n        1.

Here is a breakdown of the reasoning process.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Data\n*   **Broad Absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is the classic signature of an O-H bond stretch in a hydrogen-bonded system, which is characteristic of carboxylic acids.\n*   **Strong Absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is a definitive peak for a C=O (carbonyl) bond stretch, with the frequency being typical for a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion:** The FTIR data confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). Since all four candidate structures (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, this information confirms the compound class but does not differentiate between the isomers. The definitive answer must come from the ¹H NMR data.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Data\nThe key to solving the problem lies in understanding the complex splitting patterns, which describe the proton's local environment. This is governed by the n+1 rule, where a signal is split into n+1 peaks by 'n' equivalent neighboring protons.\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This confirms the molecule is saturated (has no C=C double bonds), which is consistent with all four options.\n*   **Signal 1: A \"doublet of triplets of quartets\" (dtq):** This highly specific pattern means a single proton is being split by three different, non-equivalent groups of neighboring protons:\n    *   One adjacent proton (-CH-) causes the **doublet (d)**.\n    *   Two adjacent protons (-CH₂-) cause the **triplet (t)**.\n    *   Three adjacent protons (-CH₃) cause the **quartet (q)**.\n    Therefore, we need to find a methine proton (-CH-) in the structure that is simultaneously adjacent to a -CH group, a -CH₂- group, and a -CH₃ group.\n*   **Signal 2: A \"doublet of triplets of triplets\" (dtt):** This indicates that a *different* proton in the molecule is also split by three non-equivalent groups of neighbors:\n    *   One adjacent proton (-CH-) causes the **doublet (d)**.\n    *   Two adjacent protons (-CH₂-) cause one **triplet (t)**.\n    *   A second, different group of two adjacent protons (another -CH₂-) causes the second **triplet (t)**.\n    Therefore, we must find a second methine proton (-CH-) that is simultaneously adjacent to a -CH group and two different -CH₂- groups.\n\nThe task is to find the **single structure** that contains protons that can generate **both** of these unique signals.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Each Candidate Structure Systematically\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    The proton at C3 is adjacent to the proton at C2 (1H), the -CH₂- group at C4 (2H), and its own methyl substituent (3H). This environment `{1H, 2H, 3H}` would produce a `dqt` (or `dtq`) signal. However, this molecule lacks a proton adjacent to one -CH- and two different -CH₂- groups. Thus, it cannot produce a `dtt` signal. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n    The proton at C3 is adjacent to the proton at C2 (1H), the -CH₂- group at C4 (2H), and the -CH₂- of its ethyl substituent (2H). This environment `{1H, 2H, 2H}` would produce a `dtt` signal. However, there is no proton in the molecule that has neighbors of `{1H, 2H, 3H}`. Thus, it cannot produce a `dtq` signal. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    The proton at C3 is adjacent to the proton at C4 (1H), the -CH₂- group at C2 (2H), and its own methyl substituent (3H). This environment `{1H, 2H, 3H}` would produce a `dqt` (or `dtq`) signal. However, like option A, it lacks the necessary environment to produce a `dtt` signal. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\n    Let's draw this structure and analyze the two key methine protons.\n    `HOOC(1) - CH₂(2) - CH(3)(Et) - CH(4)(Et) - CH₃(5)`\n    *   **Proton at C4:** It is adjacent to three different groups: the proton at C3 (1H), the methyl group at C5 (3H), and the methylene group of its ethyl substituent (2H). Its set of neighbors is `{1H, 2H, 3H}`. This environment will produce a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**, perfectly matching Signal 1.\n    *   **Proton at C3:** It is adjacent to three different groups: the proton at C4 (1H), the methylene group at C2 (2H), and the methylene group of its ethyl substituent (2H). Its set of neighbors is `{1H, 2H, 2H}`. This environment will produce a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**, perfectly matching Signal 2.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe structure of **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**, which corresponds to the formula `CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH`, is the only candidate that contains two different protons whose environments perfectly match the requirements to produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal in the ¹H NMR spectrum.

The deciding evidence must come from the NMR data.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe ¹H NMR data provides the crucial details needed to identify the correct molecular structure.\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This confirms that the molecule is saturated (contains no C=C double bonds), which is true for all four options.\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This complex splitting pattern indicates a single proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons. Using the `n+1` rule:\n    *   **d**oublet = coupling to **1** neighboring proton (a -CH- group).\n    *   **t**riplet = coupling to **2** neighboring protons (a -CH₂- group).\n    *   **q**uartet = coupling to **3** neighboring protons (a -CH₃ group).\n    We must find a structure with a proton whose neighbors consist of a `{1H, 2H, 3H}` set.\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This indicates that a *different* proton in the molecule is coupled to another unique set of three neighboring proton groups:\n    *   **d**oublet = coupling to **1** neighboring proton (a -CH- group).\n    *   **t**riplet = coupling to **2** neighboring protons (a -CH₂- group).\n    *   another **t**riplet = coupling to a second, non-equivalent group of **2** protons (another -CH₂- group).\n    We must find a structure with another proton whose neighbors consist of a `{1H, 2H, 2H}` set.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate Each Candidate Structure**\n\nThe final step is to systematically evaluate each structure to see which is the *only one* that meets both NMR criteria.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    The proton at C3 has the required `{1H, 2H, 3H}` neighbors to produce a `dtq` signal. However, no proton in the molecule has the `{1H, 2H, 2H}` neighbors needed for a `dtt` signal. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n    The proton at C3 has the required `{1H, 2H, 2H}` neighbors to produce a `dtt` signal. However, no proton has the `{1H, 2H, 3H}` neighbors needed for a `dtq` signal. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    The proton at C3 has `{1H, 2H, 3H}` neighbors, which would give a `dtq` signal. However, this molecule only contains one -CH₂- group, making it impossible to form a `dtt` signal, which requires two distinct -CH₂- neighbors for a single proton. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\n    Let's analyze the two central methine (-CH-) protons in this structure, numbering the main chain from the carboxyl end: `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(Et)-CH(4)(Et)-CH₃(5)`\n    *   **Proton at C4:** This proton is adjacent to the proton at C3 (1H, giving a **doublet**), the CH₂ group of its ethyl substituent (2H, giving a **triplet**), and the CH₃ group at C5 (3H, giving a **quartet**). This proton's signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This perfectly matches the first required signal.\n    *   **Proton at C3:** This proton is adjacent to the proton at C4 (1H, giving a **doublet**), the CH₂ group at C2 (2H, giving a **triplet**), and the CH₂ group of its own ethyl substituent (2H, giving another **triplet**). This proton's signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This perfectly matches the second required signal.\n\nThis structure is the only one that contains protons which satisfy both of the complex splitting patterns described.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
