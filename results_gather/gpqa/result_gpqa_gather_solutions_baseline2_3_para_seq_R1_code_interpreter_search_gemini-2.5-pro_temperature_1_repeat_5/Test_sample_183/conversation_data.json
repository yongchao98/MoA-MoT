The requirement for a \"high-yield\" synthesis means that any route relying on the separation of a minor isomer is likely incorrect, and that the sequence of reactions must be highly regioselective.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Each Option for Chemical Feasibility\nWe must eliminate any option that contains a chemically impossible step or uses a fundamentally flawed strategy.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    This sequence involves forming nitrobenzene (i), then aniline (ii), and then attempting a Friedel-Crafts alkylation (iii). The Friedel-Crafts reaction fails on the deactivated aniline ring because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) complexes with the basic amino group. **This option is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    This option has a fatal flaw in its ordering. Step (iv) is a diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`), which requires an amino (-NH2) group. However, the substrate after step (iii) (a sulfonated nitro compound) does not have an amino group. A reaction cannot be performed on a functional group that does not exist. **This option is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    This option begins with a classic blocking group strategy.\n    1.  Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene\n    2.  Sulfonation -> 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (blocking the para position).\n    3.  Nitration -> This gives 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.\n    *   **Crucial Flaw:** In this key intermediate, the tert-butyl and nitro groups are *meta* (1,3 relationship) to each other. The target molecule requires them to be *ortho* (1,2 relationship). Therefore, this entire strategy, while high-yield, produces the wrong isomer. Furthermore, later in the sequence (step vi), it attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt, which is nonsensical. **This option is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    This is the only remaining option. Let's trace its chemical pathway.\n    1.  **i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` on benzene → tert-butylbenzene.** (Standard reaction).\n    2.  **ii) `HNO3/H2SO4` on tert-butylbenzene.** This gives a mixture of ortho- and para-nitrated products. The para isomer is major. To reach the target, one must proceed with the **minor ortho isomer** (`1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene`). This step contradicts the \"high-yield\" requirement but is chemically possible.\n    3.  **iii) `Fe/HCl` on 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene → 2-tert-butylaniline.** (Standard reduction).\n    4.  **iv) `HNO3/H2SO4` on 2-tert-butylaniline.** This is the key step. In strong acid, the aniline is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+). The -NH3+ group (at C1) is a meta-director. The -tBu group (at C2) is an o,p-director. The directing effects are cooperative, both pushing the incoming nitro group to position C3, yielding **3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline**. This creates the required 1,2,3-pattern.\n    5.  **v) `NaNO2/HCl` →** Diazotization of the amino group.\n    6.  **vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat` →** Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to form the phenol (`2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol`).\n    7.  **vii) `NaOH/EtBr` →** Williamson ether synthesis gives the target molecule, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. The final two steps listed (viii, ix) are superfluous distractors.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOptions B, C, and D are invalid because they contain chemically impossible reaction steps or are based on strategies that definitively lead to the wrong isomers. Option A describes the only sequence that is chemically capable of producing the correct target molecule. Its primary weakness is the non-selective nitration in step (ii), which violates the \"high-yield\" criterion. However, given that it is the only chemically logical and coherent pathway among the choices, it must be the intended answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\n### Step-by-step Analysis of the Synthesis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Target Molecule**:\n    The target is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    *   **Substituents**: Ethoxy (-OEt), tert-Butyl (-tBu), Nitro (-NO2).\n    *   **Substitution Pattern**: The groups are at positions C1, C2, and C3 respectively. This is a vicinal or 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern.\n    *   **Directing Effects**: -OEt and -tBu are ortho,para-directors. -NO2 is a meta-director. The protonated amine (-NH3+), a likely intermediate, is a meta-director.\n    *   **Challenge**: The \"high-yield\" synthesis of a sterically crowded 1,2,3-isomer is non-trivial and requires precise control over the reaction sequence. A simple sequential addition of groups is unlikely to work due to competing directing effects.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Core Synthetic Strategies**:\n    There are two main strategies to consider for forming the required relationship between the substituents.\n\n    *   **Strategy 1: Using the major isomer from the first nitration (The \"Typo\" Hypothesis)**.\n        1.  Alkylation: Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene.\n        2.  Nitration: This reaction is high-yield, but the major product is **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene** due to the steric hindrance of the tert-butyl group.\n        3.  Following a high-yield sequence from this intermediate (`reduction -> second nitration -> diazotization -> hydrolysis -> etherification`) produces **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**. This is a 1,2,4-isomer, not the requested 1,2,3-isomer. This strategy, while high-yield, leads to the wrong product.\n\n    *   **Strategy 2: A pathway to the correct isomer (The \"Low-Yield Step\" Hypothesis)**.\n        This is the only pathway discussed that can produce the correctly named molecule.\n        1.  **`i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` on benzene -> `tert-butylbenzene`**: A standard Friedel-Crafts reaction.\n        2.  **`ii) HNO3/H2SO4` on tert-butylbenzene -> `1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene`**: This is the key step. While the para isomer is major, the *ortho* isomer is also formed. To make the target product, we must proceed with this **minor isomer**. This step violates the \"high-yield\" criterion, but it is chemically necessary.\n        3.  **`iii) Fe/HCl` -> `2-tert-butylaniline`**: Standard reduction of the nitro group to an amine.\n        4.  **`iv) HNO3/H2SO4` -> `3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline`**: This is a crucial regiochemical step. Under the strong acid of nitrating mixture, the amine at C1 is protonated to an anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group at C2 is an *ortho,para*-director. Both the -NH3+ and -tBu groups direct the incoming nitro group to position C3. Because the directors are cooperative, this step is plausible and sets up the required 1,2,3 pattern.\n        5.  **`v) NaNO2/HCl`**: Diazotization of the amine.\n        6.  **`vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat`**: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to form a phenol (`3-nitro-2-tert-butylphenol`).\n        7.  **`vii) NaOH/EtBr`**: Williamson ether synthesis to convert the phenol into the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n3.  **Conclusion and Final Decision**:\n    *   Strategies that start with a blocking group (sulfonation) or proceed through the major para-nitro isomer lead definitively to the wrong final product isomers.\n    *   Strategy 2 is the only pathway that produces the correctly named molecule. Its primary flaw is the low yield of the ortho-nitration step (step ii). However, the subsequent steps are chemically sound.\n    *   In multiple-choice chemistry questions of this nature, a pathway that is chemically possible but violates a condition like \"high-yield\" is often considered more correct than a pathway that is high-yield but leads to a completely different molecule. The question is testing the knowledge of the transformations required to build the target structure.\n    *   The sequence of reagents outlined in Strategy 2 is contained within **Option A** as presented by most candidate answers (the final steps `viii` and `ix` are superfluous distractors). This makes it the only plausible, albeit imperfect, choice.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nAnswering this question requires a multi-faceted analysis of organic synthesis principles, focusing on regiochemistry, reaction feasibility, and the \"high-yield\" constraint.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruction of the Target Molecule\nThe target is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** It is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring. This vicinal (adjacent) pattern is often synthetically challenging.\n*   **Substituents and their Relationships:**\n    *   C1: Ethoxy (-OEt), a strong activator and *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   C2: tert-Butyl (-tBu), a bulky activator and *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   C3: Nitro (-NO2), a strong deactivator and *meta*-director.\n*   **Key Insight:** The most difficult part of the synthesis is establishing the *ortho* relationship between the bulky tert-butyl group and the nitro group in high yield.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluation of Potential Synthetic Strategies\nWe will analyze the three main strategies discussed across the candidate answers.\n\n1.  **Direct Nitration Strategy (Flawed):**\n    *   Path: `tert-Butylbenzene → (Nitration) → ...`\n    *   Analysis: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene produces primarily the *para* isomer due to the large steric hindrance of the tert-butyl group. The desired *ortho* isomer is a minor product. Any synthesis relying on this initial step cannot be \"high-yield\" and is therefore incorrect according to the problem's constraints.\n\n2.  **Blocking Group Strategy (Leads to the Wrong Isomer):**\n    *   Path: `tert-Butylbenzene → (Sulfonation) → 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid → (Nitration) ...`\n    *   Analysis: This is a powerful high-yield strategy. Sulfonation blocks the *para* position. Subsequent nitration is directed by both the tBu group (directs *ortho*) and the -SO3H group (directs *meta*) to the same positions. This yields `4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`.\n    *   **Crucial Flaw:** While this creates an *ortho* relationship between the tBu and NO2 groups as required, this pathway cannot be easily completed to yield the final product. More importantly, many simpler blocking group strategies that might be envisioned lead to an intermediate where the tBu and NO2 groups are *meta* to each other, which is incorrect.\n\n3.  **The Advanced \"Toolkit\" Strategy (Correct but Complex):**\n    *   A genuinely high-yield synthesis of this specific molecule requires a more complex route. The key is to recognize the full set of reactions required to control the placement of all three groups.\n    *   **Plausible High-Yield Path:**\n        1.  Alkylation (`tBuCl/AlCl3`)\n        2.  Sulfonation (blocking group) (`SO3/H2SO4`)\n        3.  First Nitration (`HNO3/H2SO4`) to install the first NO2 group.\n        4.  Second Nitration (`HNO3/H2SO4`) to install a second NO2 group.\n        5.  Selective Reduction (`Fe/HCl`) of one NO2 group to an amine.\n        6.  Desulfonation (unblocking) (`dilute H2SO4`)\n        7.  Conversion of the amine to the final ethoxy group via diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`), hydrolysis (`H3O+/Heat`), and etherification (`NaOH/EtBr`).\n    *   **Insight:** This sophisticated path is the only one that is both high-yield and leads to the correct product. The problem then becomes: which option provides the necessary \"toolkit\" of reagents to perform this synthesis?\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of the Options as Reagent Toolkits\n\nWe must check which option provides all the necessary reagents for the correct advanced synthesis, regardless of the jumbled order in which they are presented.\n\n*   **Required Reagents:** `tBuCl/AlCl3`, `SO3/H2SO4`, `dilute H2SO4`, `Fe/HCl`, `NaNO2/HCl`, `H3O+/Heat`, `NaOH/EtBr`, and crucially, **two separate nitration steps (`HNO3/H2SO4`)**.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Given Options:**\n    *   Option A: Contains only one `HNO3/H2SO4` step. It lacks the reagents for the correct pathway.\n    *   Option B: Contains only one `HNO3/H2SO4` step and nonsensical ordering.\n    *   **Option C**: Its reagent list is: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4`. This is the **only option** that provides two distinct `HNO3/H2SO4` reagents, along with all other required components for the valid, high-yield synthesis.\n    *   Option D: Contains only one `HNO3/H2SO4` step.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nWhile the sequence listed in Option C is chemically illogical, it is the only option that contains the complete set of reagents necessary for the only plausible high-yield synthesis of the target molecule. In complex synthesis problems of this type, the answer often lies in identifying the necessary \"toolkit\" rather than a perfectly ordered list.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\n**Analysis of the Task**\n\nThe goal is to determine the single best reaction sequence for the \"high-yield\" synthesis of **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene** from benzene. This involves a careful analysis of the target molecule's structure and a step-by-step evaluation of the chemical feasibility and regiochemistry of each proposed pathway.\n\n**1. Deconstruction of the Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent substituents (a vicinal, or 1,2,3-pattern).\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt), a strong *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu), a bulky *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2), a strong *meta*-director.\n*   **Synthetic Challenge:** The 1,2,3-substitution pattern is sterically crowded and electronically difficult to achieve directly. The \"high-yield\" requirement suggests that any path relying on the separation of a minor isomer is unlikely to be correct, and that regioselectivity at each step is critical.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Evaluation of Proposed Synthetic Strategies**\n\nWe will evaluate the main strategies present in the candidate options:\n\n*   **Strategy Based on Friedel-Crafts on Aniline (Option C):** This route attempts to nitrate benzene, reduce it to aniline, and then perform a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. This strategy fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, deactivating the ring and making the alkylation step fail or have extremely low yield. Therefore, this is not a valid high-yield pathway.\n\n*   **Strategy Based on Flawed Sequencing (Options B, D):** These options contain chemically impossible steps in their sequences. For example, they propose using `NaNO2/HCl` (a reagent for diazotization of an amine) on a molecule that has no amino group, or attempting to nitrate a highly unstable diazonium salt intermediate. These sequences are chemically nonsensical.\n\n*   **Strategy Based on a \"High-Yield\" Pathway to the Wrong Isomer:** A common high-yield approach is to alkylate benzene to tert-butylbenzene, then nitrate it. The major product is `1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene`. Further functionalization of this major isomer is high-yield but leads to a **1,2,4-substituted product**, not the required 1,2,3-isomer. While this is a sound synthesis, it does not produce the target molecule. This suggests the possibility of a typo in the question's target molecule name, but we must first evaluate if any option can produce the stated target.\n\n*   **Strategy Based on the correct Functional Group Conversions (Option A):** This option is the only one remaining after eliminating the others based on fundamental chemical errors. Let's trace its path carefully:\n    1.  **i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` on benzene → tert-butylbenzene.** (Standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation).\n    2.  **ii) `HNO3/H2SO4` on tert-butylbenzene →** This nitration step produces a mixture. To obtain the desired product, one must proceed with the **minor isomer**, `1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene`. While this step is not \"high-yield,\" it is a necessary step in the only plausible pathway.\n    3.  **iii) `Fe/HCl` on 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene → `2-tert-butylaniline`**. (Standard nitro reduction).\n    4.  **iv) `HNO3/H2SO4` on 2-tert-butylaniline →** This is the key step to set the 1,2,3 pattern. Under strong acidic conditions, the amine at C1 is protonated to `-NH3+`, a *meta*-director. This directs the incoming nitro group to position C3, creating `3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline`.\n    5.  **v) `NaNO2/HCl` on 3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline →** Diazotization of the amino group.\n    6.  **vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat` on the diazonium salt → `3-nitro-2-tert-butylphenol`**. (Standard hydrolysis of a diazonium salt).\n    7.  **vii) `NaOH/EtBr` on 3-nitro-2-tert-butylphenol → `2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene`**. (Standard Williamson ether synthesis). The final product is correct.\n    8.  **viii) & ix)** The final two steps are superfluous and serve as distractors.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Options B, C, and D are invalid because they contain chemically impossible reaction steps or follow a fundamentally flawed strategy.\n*   Option A describes a sequence of chemically correct transformations that successfully produces the target molecule. Its primary weakness is the low yield of the ortho-nitration in step (ii), which contradicts the \"high-yield\" specification in the question.\n*   However, in the context of a multiple-choice question, a pathway that is chemically possible (even if one step has low yield) is superior to pathways that are chemically impossible or definitively lead to the wrong product. Therefore, by elimination, Option A represents the only viable synthesis among the choices.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the best possible answer.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Target Molecule**\n\nThe first step is to carefully examine the target molecule: **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n*   **Structure:** It is a benzene ring with three adjacent (vicinal) substituents.\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt), a strong *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu), a bulky *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2), a strong *meta*-director.\n*   **Key Challenge:** The question specifies a **\"high-yield\"** synthesis. This is a critical constraint. Creating a 1,2,3-trisubstituted ring, especially one as crowded as this, in high yield is very difficult. Standard electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) often produces a mixture of isomers, which would violate the \"high-yield\" condition.\n\n**2. Evaluate Potential Synthetic Strategies**\n\nBased on the reagents provided in the options, there are two main strategic approaches to consider for establishing the key relationships between the groups.\n\n*   **Strategy 1: The \"Blocking Group\" Approach**\n    *   This is a common, powerful strategy for high-yield synthesis. It involves adding the tert-butyl group, blocking the sterically-favored *para* position with a sulfonic acid group (`-SO3H`), and then performing nitration.\n    *   **The Flaw:** As several analyses correctly point out, this sequence (alkylation -> para-sulfonation -> nitration) results in an intermediate where the tert-butyl and nitro groups are *meta* to each other. The target molecule requires them to be *ortho*. Therefore, this otherwise excellent high-yield strategy leads to the wrong isomer and cannot be the correct answer.\n\n*   **Strategy 2: The Sequential Substitution Approach**\n    This approach involves a sequence of additions and functional group modifications. There are two versions of this strategy depending on the first nitration step.\n    *   **Path A (Following the Major Product - Truly High Yield):**\n        1.  Alkylation: Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene.\n        2.  Nitration: Gives the major product, **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene** (high yield).\n        3.  Reduction -> 4-tert-butylaniline.\n        4.  Nitration -> 2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline (high-yield, directors are cooperative).\n        5.  This path leads cleanly and in high yield to a **1,2,4-isomer**, specifically `1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene`. This does not match the named target molecule. This suggests a potential typo in the question itself.\n\n    *   **Path B (Following the Minor Product - Not High Yield):**\n        1.  Alkylation: Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene.\n        2.  Nitration: Isolate the minor product, **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**. This step is inherently **low-yield**.\n        3.  Reduction -> 2-tert-butylaniline.\n        4.  Nitration: This is the key regiochemical step. Under strong acid, the amine is protonated to -NH3+, a *meta*-director. The t-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position C3, creating the necessary **3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline**.\n        5.  Subsequent steps (diazotization, hydrolysis, etherification) convert this intermediate into the final target molecule.\n\n**3. Final Decision Logic**\n\nWe are faced with a choice between:\n*   An incorrect strategy (Blocking Group).\n*   A valid, high-yield strategy that produces the wrong molecule, suggesting a typo in the question (Path A).\n*   A chemically plausible strategy that produces the correct molecule but violates the \"high-yield\" constraint at a key step (Path B).\n\nIn a multiple-choice chemistry problem, a pathway that is chemically possible, even if one step is inefficient, is preferable to a pathway that is chemically impossible or definitively leads to the wrong product. Path B is the only sequence of reactions discussed that can logically result in the formation of **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. The sequences in the options that match this series of transformations are the most likely intended answer, despite the \"high-yield\" language being flawed.\n\nThe sequence of reactions in Path B is: `Alkylation -> Nitration -> Reduction -> Nitration -> Diazotization/Hydrolysis -> Etherification`. Option A from the candidates describes exactly these transformations in steps (i) through (vii). The final steps (viii, ix) are superfluous distractors. Therefore, this sequence represents the only viable route among the choices to the named product.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nAn analysis of the provided answers reveals a complex organic synthesis problem with several potential pitfalls and likely a flaw in the question's premise. To determine the best answer, we must break down the synthesis logically.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule\n*   **Name:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Structure:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted (vicinal) benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents and their Directing Effects:**\n    *   C1: Ethoxy (-OEt) - a strong activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   C2: tert-Butyl (-tBu) - a weakly activating, *ortho, para*-director that is very bulky.\n    *   C3: Nitro (-NO2) - a strong deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **Key Challenge:** The \"high-yield\" requirement is critical. Synthesizing a sterically crowded 1,2,3-isomer is difficult, and any path relying on the separation of a minor product would not be considered \"high-yield\".\n\n### 2. Evaluation of Proposed Synthetic Strategies\n\nThere are three main strategies that emerge from analyzing the candidate answers:\n\n*   **Strategy 1: Using a Sulfonic Acid Blocking Group.** This is a common and powerful technique for controlling regiochemistry. The path would be: Alkylation (tBu) -> Sulfonation (to block the para position) -> Nitration.\n    *   **Flaw:** As correctly identified by several analyses, this strategy leads to an intermediate where the tert-butyl and nitro groups are *meta* to each other (e.g., 2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid). The target molecule requires these groups to be *ortho*. Therefore, this entire strategy, while high-yield, leads to the wrong isomer and cannot be correct.\n\n*   **Strategy 2: The \"Typo\" Hypothesis (High-Yield Path).** This assumes the target molecule was intended to be the more easily synthesized 1,2,4-isomer.\n    1.  **i) Friedel-Crafts Alkylation** to make tert-butylbenzene.\n    2.  **ii) Nitration:** The major, high-yield product is **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene** due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group.\n    3.  **iii) Reduction:** of the nitro group to an amine.\n    4.  **iv) Second Nitration:** Nitration of 4-tert-butylaniline is highly regioselective, giving 2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline.\n    5.  **v, vi, vii) Conversion:** The amino group is converted to the final ethoxy group via diazotization, hydrolysis to a phenol, and Williamson ether synthesis.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a sound, high-yield synthesis for **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**. If the question contains a typo in the target's name, this is the intended chemical pathway. This sequence of reaction types is described by option A.\n\n*   **Strategy 3: The \"Minor Isomer\" Path (Correct Product).** This strategy aims to produce the exact molecule named in the question.\n    1.  **i) Friedel-Crafts Alkylation** to make tert-butylbenzene.\n    2.  **ii) Nitration:** This step produces a mixture. To proceed, one must isolate the **minor ortho isomer**, 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene. **This step is not high-yield**, contradicting the question's premise.\n    3.  **iii) Reduction:** of the nitro group to give 2-tert-butylaniline.\n    4.  **iv) Second Nitration:** This is a key regiochemical step. The amino group at C1 is protonated to the meta-directing anilinium ion (-NH3+), and the t-butyl group at C2 is an o,p-director. The directing effects are cooperative, both pointing to C3. This makes the formation of the required **3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline** plausible.\n    5.  **v, vi, vii) Conversion:** The amino group is transformed into the final ethoxy group as in Strategy 2.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This pathway successfully produces the target molecule. Its major flaw is the low-yield first nitration step. This sequence of reaction types is also perfectly described by option A.\n\n### 3. Final Decision\n\n*   Options B, C, and D are demonstrably flawed, as they contain chemically impossible or nonsensical steps (e.g., Friedel-Crafts on aniline, diazotizing a molecule without an amine).\n*   Option A describes a sequence of reactions that is chemically logical. The superfluous steps at the end (viii, ix) are distractors.\n*   The sequence in Option A can be interpreted in two ways: as a high-yield synthesis of the wrong molecule (Strategy 2), or a lower-yield synthesis of the correct molecule (Strategy 3).\n*   In a multiple-choice context where only one answer can be the best, a sequence that is chemically viable but imperfect (due to a low-yield step) is far superior to sequences that are chemically impossible. Since the path described in Option A is the only one that can lead to the named product, it must be the intended answer, despite the \"high-yield\" claim being questionable.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the best answer.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Challenge\n\n*   **Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Structure:** It is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring. The three substituents (-OEt, -tBu, -NO2) are all adjacent to one another.\n*   **Key Relationships:**\n    *   The tert-butyl (-tBu) group is *ortho* to both the ethoxy (-OEt) and nitro (-NO2) groups.\n    *   The ethoxy (-OEt) group and the nitro (-NO2) group are *meta* to each other.\n*   **Challenge:** The question demands a **\"high-yield\"** synthesis. This is a crucial constraint. Creating a crowded 1,2,3-isomer with high yield is difficult because standard reactions often produce mixtures of isomers. We must find a pathway where each step is highly efficient and regioselective (i.e., it produces one desired isomer in a much greater amount than others).\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate the Plausibility of the Starting Sequences\n\nAll four options provided are permutations of the same nine reaction steps. The key difference is the *order* of the initial steps, which defines the entire synthetic strategy. Let's analyze the opening strategy of each option.\n\n*   **Option D:** Starts with `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`.\n    *   This sequence attempts to perform a Friedel-Crafts alkylation (step iii) on aniline (the product of steps i and ii). This reaction fails or gives very low yields because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, deactivating the aromatic ring. This is not a viable high-yield strategy. **Therefore, Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B and C:** Both start with `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4`.\n    *   This sequence involves the direct nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The -tBu group is an *ortho, para*-director, but because it is very bulky, substitution at the *para* position is heavily favored over the more sterically hindered *ortho* position.\n    *   To get to the target molecule, one would need to isolate the minor *ortho*-nitro product and carry it forward. A synthesis that relies on isolating a minor product at a key early step cannot be considered \"high-yield\". **Therefore, Options B and C begin with a flawed strategy.**\n\n*   **Option A:** Starts with `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4`.\n    *   This is a classic and powerful **blocking group strategy**.\n    1.  **Alkylation:** Benzene is converted to tert-butylbenzene.\n    2.  **Sulfonation:** The sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) is installed. It preferentially adds to the *para* position, which is sterically accessible and electronically activated by the -tBu group. This step effectively \"blocks\" the most reactive site, yielding 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n    3.  **Nitration:** Now, the ring is nitrated. Let's analyze the directing effects on the intermediate (numbering with -SO3H at C1, -tBu at C4):\n        *   The -tBu group (at C4) directs incoming groups to its *ortho* positions (C3 and C5).\n        *   The -SO3H group (at C1) directs incoming groups to its *meta* positions (C3 and C5).\n        *   The directing effects are **cooperative**, forcing the nitro group to add to position C3 (or C5) with very high selectivity. This gives 3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n    *   This initial three-step sequence is highly regioselective and produces the critical intermediate, where the -tBu and -NO2 groups are *ortho* to each other, in high yield. This is the only opening strategy presented that satisfies the \"high-yield\" requirement for creating the necessary substitution pattern.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\nWhile the later steps in Option A are not listed in a fully logical order, its initial strategic sequence (Alkylation → Blocking with Sulfonation → Controlled Nitration) is the only one among the choices that is chemically sound for a **high-yield** synthesis of an intermediate with the required ortho-tert-butyl-nitro relationship. The other options either begin with a fundamentally flawed chemical step (D) or a non-selective, low-yield step (B and C). In a complex synthesis problem, the choice of the correct initial strategy is paramount. Option A is the only one that demonstrates the correct high-yield approach from the beginning.\n\nThe complete, high-yield synthesis is very complex, requiring two nitrations and selective functional group transformations, but it is plausible. Option A is the only one that contains the necessary reagents for such a path and, most importantly, begins with the correct regiochemical control steps.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\nThe first step is to carefully deconstruct the target molecule to understand the synthetic challenges.\n*   **Name:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent (vicinal) substituents.\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt), a strong activator and *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   Position 2: Tert-butyl group (-tBu), a bulky activator and *ortho, para*-director that strongly favors para-substitution.\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2), a strong deactivator and *meta*-director.\n*   **Key Challenge:** The question asks for a \"high-yield\" synthesis. The 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern is sterically crowded and electronically complex, making a high-yield synthesis non-trivial. The conflicting directing effects of the substituents must be carefully managed.\n\n### 2. Evaluate the Proposed Synthetic Pathways in the Options\n\nLet's evaluate the primary strategy of each option to check for chemical feasibility and whether it can produce the target in high yield.\n\n*   **Option A: The Blocking Group Strategy**\n    *   **Sequence:** i) Alkylation (tBu), ii) Sulfonation (-SO3H), iii) Nitration (-NO2) ...\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a classic and powerful strategy to control regiochemistry. Step (i) produces tert-butylbenzene. Step (ii) places a sulfonic acid group at the para position (the most favored site), yielding 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. In step (iii), nitration occurs. The -tBu group directs ortho, and the -SO3H group directs meta; both direct the incoming -NO2 group to position 2. This gives 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** In this key intermediate, the t-butyl and nitro groups are *meta* to each other. The target molecule requires them to be *ortho*. Therefore, this strategy, while high-yield, leads to the wrong isomer and cannot produce the target molecule. **Option A is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D: Friedel-Crafts on a Deactivated Ring**\n    *   **Sequence:** i) Nitration (-NO2), ii) Reduction to Aniline (-NH2), iii) Alkylation (tBu) ...\n    *   **Analysis:** This pathway starts by creating aniline. Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. This reaction fails or gives extremely poor yields because the basic amino group of aniline reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), forming a complex that strongly deactivates the benzene ring. This is not a viable high-yield reaction. **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B: Scrambled / Nonsensical Steps**\n    *   **Sequence:** The order of reactions is chemically illogical. It lists two nitration steps (ii and vi in some interpretations) and includes diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`) without having first formed a primary amine in a plausible sequence. As written, it is not a valid synthetic route. **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C: The Direct Sequential Substitution Strategy**\n    *   **Sequence:** i) Alkylation (tBu), ii) Nitration, iii) Reduction, iv) Second Nitration ...\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the only remaining option. Let's trace the pathway step-by-step:\n        1.  **i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` on benzene -> tert-butylbenzene.** (Standard reaction).\n        2.  **ii) `HNO3/H2SO4` on tert-butylbenzene.** This step gives a mixture of ortho- and para-nitrated products. The para-isomer is the major product (~70-80%), while the required ortho-isomer is the minor product (~15-20%). To reach the final target, we *must* proceed with the minor **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**. This step conflicts with the \"high-yield\" requirement, but it is the only chemically possible route to the target among the choices.\n        3.  **iii) `Fe/HCl` on 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene -> 2-tert-butylaniline.** (Standard reduction).\n        4.  **iv) `HNO3/H2SO4` on 2-tert-butylaniline.** This is the crucial step that sets the 1,2,3 pattern. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a *meta*-director. The t-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director. In this specific case, both groups direct the incoming nitro group to position C3, allowing for the formation of **3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline**.\n        5.  **v -> vii) Conversion of the amino group.** The remaining steps are a standard sequence: `v) Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl)` -> `vi) Hydrolysis (H3O+/Heat)` to form the phenol -> `vii) Williamson Ether Synthesis (NaOH/EtBr)` to form the final ethoxy group. This sequence successfully yields the target molecule, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile Option C involves a step (the initial ortho-nitration) that is not high-yield, it is the only sequence presented that is not invalidated by a fundamental chemical flaw. The other options either lead definitively to the wrong isomer (A), rely on a reaction that fails (D), or are chemically nonsensical as written (B). Therefore, in the context of choosing the best possible answer, the sequence that actually produces the target molecule, even if imperfectly, is the correct choice.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\n### Analysis of the Synthetic Problem\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Target Molecule**\n*   **Name:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent (vicinal) substituents.\n    *   C1: -OEt (ethoxy group), a strong activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   C2: -tBu (tert-butyl group), a bulky activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   C3: -NO2 (nitro group), a strong deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **Key Challenge:** The question specifies a **\"high-yield\"** synthesis of this sterically crowded 1,2,3-isomer. This is a significant challenge due to competing directing effects and steric hindrance.\n\n### 2. Evaluate the Plausible Synthetic Strategies\n\nBased on the candidate answers and chemical principles, three main strategies are proposed.\n\n**Strategy A: The \"Blocking Group\" Approach**\n1.  Start with Friedel-Crafts alkylation to get tert-butylbenzene.\n2.  Use sulfonation (`SO3/H2SO4`) to block the sterically favored *para* position. This gives 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n3.  Perform nitration. Both the -tBu and -SO3H groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same position, yielding **3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   **Fatal Flaw:** While this establishes the necessary *ortho* relationship between the tert-butyl and nitro groups, the sulfonic acid group (the precursor to the final ethoxy group) is in the wrong position. This intermediate has a 1,3,4 substitution pattern, which cannot be converted into the target 1,2,3 pattern. Thus, this high-yield strategy leads to the wrong isomer.\n\n**Strategy B: The \"High-Yield Isomer\" Approach**\n1.  Start with Friedel-Crafts alkylation to get tert-butylbenzene.\n2.  Perform nitration. The major product (formed in high yield) is the *para* isomer, **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene**.\n3.  A series of high-yield steps (reduction of -NO2, second nitration *ortho* to the resulting amino group, and converting the amino group to ethoxy) will cleanly produce **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**.\n*   **Fatal Flaw:** This is a sound, high-yield synthesis, but it produces a 1,2,4-isomer, not the named 1,2,3-isomer. This path is only correct if the question contains a typo in the target molecule's name.\n\n**Strategy C: The \"Correct Product via Low-Yield Step\" Approach**\nThis is the only proposed strategy that can lead to the correctly named target molecule.\n1.  **Alkylation:** Benzene → **tert-butylbenzene**.\n2.  **Nitration:** Perform nitration of tert-butylbenzene. Isolate the **minor ortho-isomer**, `1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene`. *This step is inherently NOT high-yield, which contradicts the question's premise*.\n3.  **Reduction:** Reduce the nitro group to an amine (`Fe/HCl`) to get **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n4.  **Second Nitration:** This is the key regiochemical step. Under the strong acidic conditions of nitration (`HNO3/H2SO4`), the amino group is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+). The -NH3+ group (at C1) is a *meta*-director. The -tBu group (at C2) is an *ortho, para*-director. The directing effects of both groups cooperate, guiding the incoming nitro group to position **C3**. This gives the required `3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline`.\n5.  **Functional Group Conversion:** The amino group is converted to the final ethoxy group via a standard sequence: diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`), hydrolysis to a phenol (`H3O+/Heat`), and Williamson ether synthesis (`NaOH/EtBr`).\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Strategies A and B are fundamentally flawed because they lead to the wrong final isomers, despite being high-yield.\n*   Strategy C is the only chemically plausible route to the specified target molecule. Its major weakness is the low-yield ortho-nitration step at the beginning. However, in the context of a flawed multiple-choice question, a pathway that is chemically possible (even if imperfect) is the correct answer over pathways that are chemically impossible or lead to the wrong product.\n*   Most candidate answers that correctly analyze the problem arrive at this conclusion, identifying Strategy C as the only viable option. The consensus of reasoning points to the sequence: **Alkylation → Nitration → Reduction → Second Nitration → Diazotization/Hydrolysis → Etherification.**\n*   While the letter designations (A, B, C, D) are assigned inconsistently in the provided candidate responses, the chemical reasoning points overwhelmingly to one specific pathway. The sequence presented in **Option A** of the provided answers (steps i through vii, ignoring the nonsensical final steps) matches the plausible, if imperfect, synthesis of the target molecule via a second nitration of an aniline derivative.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct sequence of reactions for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Target Molecule\nFirst, we must understand the structure of the final product and the synthetic challenges it presents.\n*   **Name:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent (vicinal) substituents:\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt), a strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu), a weakly activating, *ortho, para*-director. It is sterically bulky.\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2), a strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **Key Challenge:** The question demands a **\"high-yield\"** synthesis. The 1,2,3-substitution pattern is often difficult to achieve in high yield due to competing electronic effects and steric hindrance.\n\n### 2. Evaluate Each Option for Chemical Feasibility\n\nWe will now analyze each proposed reaction sequence to determine its validity.\n\n*   **Option B: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`**\n    This sequence is chemically impossible as written. Step (iv), diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`), requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2) as the starting material. The intermediate formed after step (iii) does not have an amine group. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C: `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`**\n    This sequence begins by forming aniline (`i` and `ii`). Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. This reaction fails or proceeds with very low yield because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, deactivating the ring towards further electrophilic substitution. This is not a viable high-yield pathway.\n\n*   **Option D: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`**\n    This sequence employs a common blocking group strategy. Let's trace the regiochemistry:\n    1.  `i) & ii)`: tert-Butylbenzene is sulfonated, blocking the sterically favored *para* position to yield `4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`.\n    2.  `iii) HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration occurs. The t-butyl group (at C4) directs ortho, and the sulfonic acid group (at C1) directs meta. Both direct the incoming nitro group to position 2, forming `2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`.\n    3.  **Crucial Flaw:** In this key intermediate, the t-butyl group and the nitro group are **meta** to each other. The target molecule requires them to be **ortho**. Therefore, this entire strategy, while high-yield, leads to the wrong isomer and cannot be correct.\n\n*   **Option A: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`**\n    By elimination, this is the only remaining possibility. Let's trace its chemical pathway:\n    1.  **Step i:** `Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` → **tert-Butylbenzene**. (Standard Friedel-Crafts)\n    2.  **Step ii:** `tert-Butylbenzene + HNO3/H2SO4`. This nitration produces a mixture of ortho and para isomers. To synthesize the target molecule, we must proceed with the minor **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene** (ortho) product. This step is a weakness regarding the \"high-yield\" claim, but let's continue as it's the only path to the correct skeletal structure.\n    3.  **Step iii:** `... + Fe/HCl`. The nitro group is reduced to an amine, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Standard reduction)\n    4.  **Step iv:** `2-tert-butylaniline + HNO3/H2SO4`. This is the key step to install the third group. Under strong acid, the aniline becomes the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a *meta*-director. The -NH3+ at C1 directs the new nitro group to C3. The t-butyl group at C2 also directs to an adjacent vacant position (C3). The directing effects are thus cooperative, leading to the formation of **3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline** and setting up the required 1,2,3-pattern.\n    5.  **Steps v-vii:** This is a standard sequence to convert a primary aromatic amine to an ethoxy group:\n        *   `v) NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization to a diazonium salt.\n        *   `vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat`: Hydrolysis to a phenol (`2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol`).\n        *   `vii) NaOH/EtBr`: Williamson ether synthesis to yield the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    6.  **Steps viii & ix:** These are superfluous steps at the end of the sequence, likely added as distractors.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile Option A's claim to be \"high-yield\" is questionable due to the initial ortho/para separation required in step (ii), it is the only option that presents a chemically coherent and logical sequence of reactions that successfully produces the correctly named target molecule. The other options are invalidated by either chemically impossible reactions or by employing a strategy that definitively leads to the wrong isomer. Therefore, in the context of choosing the best answer from the given list, Option A is the only viable choice.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\n### Analysis of the Synthetic Problem\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Target Molecule:**\n    *   **Name:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n    *   **Structure:** This is a benzene ring with three adjacent (vicinal) substituents:\n        *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt), an activating *ortho, para*-director.\n        *   Position 2: Tert-butyl group (-tBu), a bulky activating *ortho, para*-director.\n        *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2), a deactivating *meta*-director.\n    *   **Key Challenge:** The question specifies a \"high-yield\" synthesis. Creating a crowded 1,2,3-substituted ring in high yield is very difficult. The steric hindrance is significant, and the electronic directing effects of the groups must be carefully controlled. The key part of the synthesis is establishing the *ortho* relationship between the bulky tert-butyl group and the nitro group.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Each Option for Chemical Viability and Yield:**\n\n    *   **Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...**\n        *   This sequence attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation (step iii) on aniline (formed in steps i and ii). This reaction works very poorly or fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) complexes with the basic amino group of aniline, deactivating the ring towards electrophilic substitution. This is not a viable high-yield route. **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n    *   **Option B: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n        *   This sequence employs a blocking group strategy. Step (ii) adds a sulfonic acid group (`-SO3H`) to the *para* position of tert-butylbenzene, blocking it. In step (iii), nitration occurs. The existing `-tBu` group (at C4) is an *ortho*-director, and the `-SO3H` group (at C1) is a *meta*-director. They both direct the incoming `-NO2` group to position 2.\n        *   The resulting intermediate is `4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`. In this molecule, the tert-butyl and nitro groups are *meta* to each other. The target molecule requires them to be *ortho*. This strategy, while high-yield, leads to the wrong isomer. **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n    *   **Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...**\n        *   This sequence is written in a chemically nonsensical order. Step (iv) uses `NaNO2/HCl`, the reagent for diazotization, which requires a primary amine (`-NH2`). The molecule produced after step (iii) has no amine group, so this reaction is impossible. **Option A is incorrect.**\n\n    *   **Option C: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...**\n        *   This is the only remaining possibility. Let's trace the reaction path:\n        1.  **Step (i):** Alkylation of benzene gives `tert-butylbenzene`.\n        2.  **Step (ii):** Nitration of `tert-butylbenzene`. This step is crucial. Due to the bulkiness of the t-butyl group, nitration heavily favors the *para* product. The desired *ortho* product is a minor isomer. This step explicitly violates the \"high-yield\" condition. However, let's assume we proceed with this minor isomer to see if the rest of the synthesis is plausible.\n        3.  **Step (iii):** Reduction of `1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene` gives `2-tert-butylaniline`.\n        4.  **Step (iv):** Nitration of `2-tert-butylaniline`. Under strong acid, the amine becomes `-NH3+` (at C1), which is a *meta*-director. The `-tBu` at C2 is an *o,p*-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position C3, creating `3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline`. This successfully establishes the 1,2,3-pattern.\n        5.  **Steps (v), (vi), (vii):** This is the standard sequence to convert the primary amine (`-NH2`) at C1 into an ethoxy group (`-OEt`) via a diazonium salt and phenol intermediate.\n        *   **Conclusion on Option C:** This sequence is chemically sound and leads to the correct final product. Its only major flaw is that step (ii) is not high-yield. However, since Options A, B, and D are incorrect due to impossible reactions or leading to the wrong product entirely, Option C remains the only plausible choice.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nIn a multiple-choice setting with potentially flawed questions, we must choose the *best* answer. Options A, B, and D are fundamentally incorrect because they are either chemically impossible or lead definitively to the wrong structural isomer. Option C describes a valid, albeit not perfectly high-yield, chemical pathway to the correct target molecule. By elimination, it is the best available answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nTo determine the correct reaction sequence, we must first understand the structure of the target molecule and the chemical challenge it presents.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Name:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Structure:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring. The substituents are an ethoxy group (-OEt) at C1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at C2, and a nitro group (-NO2) at C3.\n*   **Challenge:** The vicinal (adjacent) 1,2,3-substitution pattern is sterically crowded. The question specifies a **\"high-yield\"** synthesis, which means we must avoid pathways that produce significant amounts of unwanted isomers or that rely on low-yield reactions. Standard electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) often fails to produce such specific isomers in high yield.\n\n**2. Evaluate Potential Synthetic Strategies**\n\nLet's evaluate the main strategies that emerge from the reagents provided in the options.\n\n*   **Strategy A: Direct nitration of tert-butylbenzene (The \"ortho-isomer path\")**\n    1.  Start with tert-butylbenzene.\n    2.  Nitrate it directly. This yields mostly the *para*-nitro isomer, with the required *ortho*-nitro isomer as a minor product (~15-20%).\n    3.  Proceeding with this minor product violates the \"high-yield\" constraint from the very beginning. While this pathway *can* chemically lead to the final product through a sequence of steps (reduction, second nitration, diazotization, hydrolysis, etherification), it is not a high-yield synthesis.\n\n*   **Strategy B: Using a sulfonic acid blocking group (The \"meta-isomer path\")**\n    1.  Start with tert-butylbenzene.\n    2.  Block the favored *para* position with sulfonation (`SO3/H2SO4`).\n    3.  Nitrate the ring. Both the -tBu and -SO3H groups direct the new -NO2 group to the position that is *meta* to the t-butyl group.\n    4.  This is a high-yield strategy, but it produces an intermediate where the t-butyl and nitro groups are *meta* to each other. The target molecule requires them to be *ortho*. Therefore, this strategy leads to the wrong final product.\n\n*   **Strategy C: A complex, truly high-yield pathway**\n    There is an advanced, multi-step synthesis that can plausibly produce the target in high yield. This would be the intended answer for a difficult \"high-yield\" question.\n    1.  **Alkylation:** Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene\n    2.  **Blocking:** tert-Butylbenzene -> 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid\n    3.  **First Nitration:** This forces the nitro group *ortho* to the t-butyl group, giving 2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n    4.  **Second Nitration:** All existing groups synergistically direct a second nitro group to position 6, giving 2,6-dinitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n    5.  **Selective Reduction:** The less hindered nitro group at C6 is reduced to an amine (`-NH2`).\n    6.  **Deblocking:** The sulfonic acid group is removed with dilute acid. This yields `3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline`.\n    7.  **Functional Group Conversion:** The `-NH2` group is converted to `-OEt` via diazotization, hydrolysis to a phenol, and Williamson ether synthesis.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options as \"Reagent Toolkits\"**\n\nThe reaction steps in the options are listed in a nonsensical order. This is a common distraction in complex synthesis problems. The real task is to see which option provides the necessary set of reagents (the \"toolkit\") to perform a viable synthesis.\n\nLet's check the reagent list needed for the correct, high-yield Strategy C:\n*   `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` (for alkylation)\n*   `SO3/H2SO4` (for blocking)\n*   `dilute H2SO4` (for deblocking)\n*   `HNO3/H2SO4` (needed **twice** for the two nitrations)\n*   `Fe/HCl` (for reduction)\n*   `NaNO2/HCl` (for diazotization)\n*   `H3O+, H2O/Heat` (for hydrolysis)\n*   `NaOH/EtBr` (for etherification)\n\nNow let's examine the reagents provided in each option from the prompt:\n*   **Option A:** Contains: `HNO3/H2SO4` (x2), `Fe/HCl`, `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`, `NaNO2/HCl`, `SO3/H2SO4`, `dilute H2SO4`, `H3O+, H2O/Heat`, `NaOH/EtBr`. **This option contains the complete and correct toolkit.**\n*   **Option B:** Appears to be missing the second `HNO3/H2SO4` reagent.\n*   **Option C:** Appears to be missing the second `HNO3/H2SO4` reagent.\n*   **Option D:** Is missing the crucial sulfonation/desulfonation reagents (`SO3/H2SO4` and `dilute H2SO4`).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAlthough the reaction sequence listed in Option A is out of order, it is the only option that provides the complete set of reagents required to carry out the complex, but chemically sound and high-yield, synthesis of the target molecule. The other options are missing essential reagents for any viable high-yield route.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThis problem asks for the optimal high-yield synthetic sequence to produce a specific trisubstituted benzene derivative. To solve this, we must perform a detailed analysis of the target molecule, the reagents provided, and the chemical logic of each proposed pathway.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule\n*   **Name:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent substituents (a 1,2,3- or vicinal pattern).\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt), a strong *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   Position 2: Tert-butyl group (-tBu), a bulky *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2), a strong *meta*-director.\n*   **Key Challenge:** The \"high-yield\" constraint is critical. Creating a crowded 1,2,3-isomer in high yield is synthetically difficult. Direct substitution sequences often result in mixtures of isomers, violating this constraint.\n\n### 2. Evaluation of the Proposed Synthetic Routes\n\nLet's evaluate the primary strategies presented in the candidate answers by tracing the major products at each step, which is essential for a \"high-yield\" synthesis.\n\n*   **Strategy starting with Nitration (Option D in prompt):** The sequence begins `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`. Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) complexes with the basic amine group, deactivating the ring. This is not a viable route.\n\n*   **Strategy using a \"Blocking Group\" (Starting steps of Option A in prompt):** The sequence `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...` is a standard blocking group strategy.\n    1.  **Alkylation:** Benzene → tert-Butylbenzene.\n    2.  **Sulfonation:** → 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (the sulfonic acid group blocks the favored para position).\n    3.  **Nitration:** The nitration product is `2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`.\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** In this key intermediate, the t-butyl and nitro groups are *meta* to each other. The target molecule requires them to be *ortho*. Therefore, this otherwise excellent high-yield strategy produces the wrong isomeric backbone and cannot lead to the final product.\n\n*   **The \"Double Nitration\" Strategy (Path detailed by Agent 9, using the reagents in Option C):** This advanced pathway is plausible on paper but extremely complex and relies on selective reductions that may not be high-yield in practice. More importantly, it is not described by any of the listed sequences in their correct order.\n\n### 3. The Most Plausible Route and the \"Typo Hypothesis\"\n\nLet's analyze the sequence presented in **Option A** as interpreted by several agents (and matching Option B/C in the prompt itself), as it represents the most sound chemical logic.\n*   **Sequence:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr`.\n\nLet's trace this path assuming \"high-yield\" means we always use the major product of each reaction:\n1.  **i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`:** → **tert-Butylbenzene**. (High-yield)\n2.  **ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`:** Nitration heavily favors the para position due to sterics. → **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene**. (High-yield major product)\n3.  **iii) `Fe/HCl`:** Reduction of the nitro group. → **4-tert-butylaniline**. (High-yield)\n4.  **iv) `HNO3/H2SO4`:** Second nitration. On the anilinium ion, both the meta-directing `-NH3+` at C1 and the ortho,para-directing `-tBu` at C4 are cooperative, strongly directing the incoming nitro group to the C2 position. → **4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline**. (High-yield and regioselective)\n5.  **v) `NaNO2/HCl`:** Diazotization of the amine. → **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenediazonium salt**. (Standard, efficient)\n6.  **vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`:** Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol. → **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol**. (Standard, efficient)\n7.  **vii) `NaOH/EtBr`:** Williamson ether synthesis. → **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**. (Standard, efficient)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis analysis reveals a critical point: The sequence detailed in **Option A** represents a chemically sound, multi-step, high-yield synthesis. However, it produces **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**, a 1,2,4-isomer, not the named 1,2,3-isomer.\n\nAll other proposed sequences are fatally flawed; they either contain chemically impossible steps or use a valid strategy that definitively leads to the wrong isomeric backbone. The only remaining logical conclusion is that the question contains a typo in the name of the target molecule. The sequence in Option A is the only one that represents a coherent, high-yield synthesis and is almost certainly the intended answer. The extra steps (viii, ix) listed are superfluous distractors.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the best choice among the provided options.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Target Molecule**\n\nThe goal is to perform a high-yield synthesis of **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Substituents:** Ethoxy (-OEt) at C1, tert-Butyl (-tBu) at C2, Nitro (-NO2) at C3.\n*   **Pattern:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted (vicinal) arrangement on the benzene ring.\n*   **Key Structural Features & Challenges:**\n    *   The t-butyl and nitro groups are *ortho* to each other.\n    *   The ethoxy and nitro groups are *meta* to each other.\n    *   This arrangement is sterically crowded.\n    *   The requirement for a \"high-yield\" synthesis is a critical constraint. Pathways that rely on separating a minor isomer from a major one are not considered high-yield.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Options based on their Core Strategy and Chemical Plausibility**\n\nLet's examine the chemical logic of each reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Option D:**\n    *   Starts with nitration (`i) HNO3/H2SO4`), then reduction to aniline (`ii) Fe/HCl`).\n    *   Step `iii)` attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation (`tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`) on aniline. This reaction fails or gives very poor yields because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) complexes with the basic amino group, strongly deactivating the ring.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This pathway is not viable for a high-yield synthesis. Option D is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:**\n    *   Starts with `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` and then `ii) SO3/H2SO4`. This is the start of a \"blocking group\" strategy.\n    *   This correctly forms 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid, blocking the para position.\n    *   Step `iii) HNO3/H2SO4` performs nitration. On this intermediate, both the t-butyl group and the sulfonic acid group direct the incoming nitro group to the same position, yielding **2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    *   **Critical Flaw:** In this intermediate, the t-butyl group and the nitro group are *meta* (1,3 relationship) to each other. The target molecule requires them to be *ortho* (1,2 relationship). This entire strategy, while high-yield, leads to the wrong isomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option B is incorrect as it cannot produce the target molecule.\n\n*   **Option C:**\n    *   The reaction sequence as written is chemically nonsensical.\n    *   Step `iv) NaNO2/HCl` is for diazotization, which requires an amino group (-NH2). The intermediates from the first three steps do not have an amino group. An amino group is not formed until much later (`viii) Fe/HCl`).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The sequence in Option C is impossible. It is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option A:**\n    *   Let's trace the sequence step-by-step:\n        1.  **i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` on Benzene:** Forms **tert-butylbenzene**. (Correct).\n        2.  **ii) `HNO3/H2SO4` on tert-butylbenzene:** This is a standard nitration. Due to the bulkiness of the t-butyl group, this step produces mainly the para isomer (~80%) and only a small amount of the desired ortho isomer (~15%). *This step is a weak point for the \"high-yield\" claim, but it is chemically possible to proceed by isolating the minor ortho product.*\n        3.  **iii) `Fe/HCl` on 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene:** Reduces the nitro group to an amine, forming **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Correct).\n        4.  **iv) `HNO3/H2SO4` on 2-tert-butylaniline:** This is the key regiochemical step. Under the strong acidic conditions of nitration, the amino group is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+). The -NH3+ group at C1 is a *meta*-director, guiding the incoming nitro group to C3. The -tBu group at C2 is an *o,p*-director, which also directs to C3. The directing effects are **cooperative**, favoring the formation of **3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline** and thus establishing the required 1,2,3 pattern. (Correct and regioselective).\n        5.  **v) `NaNO2/HCl`:** Converts the amino group to a diazonium salt. (Correct).\n        6.  **vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`:** Hydrolyzes the diazonium salt to a phenol. (Correct).\n        7.  **vii) `NaOH/EtBr`:** Converts the phenol to an ethoxy group via Williamson ether synthesis. (Correct).\n        8.  **viii) and ix):** These are superfluous steps at the end and can be ignored.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nWhile the initial nitration step (ii) in Option A is not high-yield for the required ortho-isomer, it is the only pathway presented that is chemically plausible and leads to the correct target molecule. The other options are fundamentally flawed because they either rely on failed reactions (Option D), lead definitively to the wrong isomer (Option B), or contain an impossible sequence of reactions (Option C).\n\nIn a multiple-choice context, the most likely answer is the one that presents a chemically possible route to the target, even if one step has a known yield issue. The question may be flawed in its \"high-yield\" assertion, but Option A is the only viable synthetic pathway among the choices.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the points from the provided candidate answers to arrive at the most logical conclusion.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule and the Core Problem\n\n*   **Target Molecule**: 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Structure**: This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring. The key challenge is that the substituents are all adjacent (vicinal), which is a sterically crowded and synthetically difficult pattern to achieve.\n*   **Key Constraint**: The question requires a **\"high-yield\"** synthesis. This means each step should be efficient and highly regioselective, avoiding the need to separate a minor product from a mixture of isomers.\n\n### 2. Evaluate the Plausibility of the Main Synthetic Strategies\n\nThere are three primary strategies presented across the candidate answers. Let's critically evaluate each one.\n\n*   **Strategy 1: The High-Yield Path to an Isomer.**\n    *   **Sequence:** Alkylation -> para-Nitration -> Reduction -> ortho-Nitration -> Diazotization/Hydrolysis -> Etherification.\n    *   **Analysis:** This pathway (analyzed by Agents 1, 8, 10) is chemically sound, and each step is high-yield because it utilizes the major product of each reaction (e.g., para-nitration of tert-butylbenzene).\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This route definitively produces **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**, which is a 1,2,4-isomer, not the required 1,2,3-isomer. This strategy is only correct if there is a typo in the question's target molecule name.\n\n*   **Strategy 2: The Blocking Group Path.**\n    *   **Sequence:** Alkylation -> para-Sulfonation (blocking) -> ortho-Nitration...\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a classic, powerful, and high-yield strategy for controlling substitution (analyzed by Agents 2, 4, 11, 12, 14).\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** After the initial steps, the key intermediate is `4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`. In this molecule, the tert-butyl and nitro groups are **meta** to each other. The target molecule requires them to be **ortho**. Therefore, this high-yield strategy cannot lead to the correct product.\n\n*   **Strategy 3: The Low-Yield Path to the Correct Product.**\n    *   **Sequence:** Alkylation -> ortho-Nitration -> Reduction -> Nitration -> Diazotization/Hydrolysis -> Etherification.\n    *   **Analysis:** This pathway (analyzed brilliantly by Agents 3, 6, 13, and 14) is the only one that can chemically lead to the correct 1,2,3-isomer.\n        1.  **Alkylation:** Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene.\n        2.  **Nitration:** This produces a mixture of ortho- and para-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. To proceed, one must isolate the **minor ortho-isomer**. This step violates the \"high-yield\" constraint but is chemically necessary.\n        3.  **Reduction:** `Fe/HCl` converts the nitro group to an amino group, forming 2-tert-butylaniline.\n        4.  **Second Nitration:** This is the key step. On 2-tert-butylaniline, the amine group protonates in acid to `-NH3+` (a meta-director) and the tert-butyl group is an ortho,para-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position C3, establishing the correct 1,2,3-pattern.\n        5.  **Conversion:** The amino group is converted to the final ethoxy group via diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`), hydrolysis (`H3O+/Heat`), and Williamson ether synthesis (`NaOH/EtBr`).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is the only sequence that leads to the named product. Its only flaw is the violation of the \"high-yield\" constraint in step 2.\n\n### 3. Final Decision\n\nWe must choose the best option among flawed alternatives.\n*   Strategies 1 and 2 are incorrect because they definitively lead to the wrong product isomer, regardless of yield.\n*   Strategy 3 leads to the correct product but has one low-yield step.\n\nIn a chemical synthesis problem, a pathway that is chemically *possible* (even if inefficient) is superior to a pathway that is chemically *impossible* or leads to the wrong destination entirely. The other proposed options contain steps that are nonsensical (e.g., diazotizing without an amine), based on failed reactions (e.g., Friedel-Crafts on an aniline), or lead to the wrong isomer.\n\nTherefore, the sequence outlined in **Strategy 3** is the only logical choice. Option **A** presents the correct sequence of reaction types for this strategy.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Target Molecule and Constraints:**\n    *   **Target:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n    *   **Structure:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring. The substituents are adjacent (vicinal), which presents a steric challenge.\n        *   C1: -OEt (Ethoxy group), a strong activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n        *   C2: -tBu (tert-Butyl group), a bulky activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n        *   C3: -NO2 (Nitro group), a strong deactivating, *meta*-director.\n    *   **Constraint:** The synthesis must be **\"high-yield.\"** This is a critical piece of information, as it implies that each reaction step should be efficient and highly regioselective (producing predominantly one isomer).\n\n2.  **Evaluate Each Option for Chemical Feasibility:**\n\n    Let's analyze each sequence from the prompt step-by-step to see if it's a valid and efficient pathway.\n\n    *   **Option A) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...**\n        This sequence begins by forming nitrobenzene, which is then reduced to aniline. Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction is known to fail or give extremely low yields because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring toward electrophilic attack. This is not a viable high-yield pathway. **Therefore, Option A is incorrect.**\n\n    *   **Option B) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...**\n        The notation in this option is confusing, and the reaction order is chemically nonsensical. Step (iv) lists `NaNO2/HCl`, the reagent for diazotization, which requires a primary amine (-NH2) as the starting material. The product after step (iii), a sulfonated and nitrated tert-butylbenzene, does not contain an amino group. The reaction is impossible as written. **Therefore, Option B is incorrect.**\n\n    *   **Option C) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ...**\n        This option employs a blocking group strategy. It starts by making tert-butylbenzene, then blocks the most favorable *para* position with sulfonation. The subsequent nitration yields `4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`. In this key intermediate, the tert-butyl and nitro groups are *meta* (in a 1,3 relationship) to each other. The target molecule requires these two groups to be *ortho* (in a 1,2 relationship). This strategy, while high-yield, leads to the wrong final isomer. **Therefore, Option C is incorrect.**\n\n    *   **Option D) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...**\n        This is the only remaining option. Let's trace its chemical logic:\n        1.  **Step (i):** Alkylation of benzene gives `tert-butylbenzene`. (Correct).\n        2.  **Step (ii):** Nitration of `tert-butylbenzene`. This is a critical step. Due to the bulkiness of the t-butyl group, nitration heavily favors the *para* product. The desired *ortho* product, `1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene`, is a minor isomer. This step violates the \"high-yield\" condition. However, it is the only path among the options that can create the necessary *ortho* relationship between the t-butyl and a nitro group.\n        3.  **Step (iii):** Reduction of the nitro group gives `2-tert-butylaniline`. (Correct).\n        4.  **Step (iv):** A second nitration. This is the key regiochemical step. In strong acid, the amine is protonated to `-NH3+`, which is a *meta*-director. Both the `-NH3+` at C1 and the `-tBu` group at C2 cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position C3, creating the required 1,2,3-pattern in `3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline`. (Chemically sound and regioselective).\n        5.  **Steps (v) to (vii):** This is a standard and efficient sequence to convert the primary amine into an ethoxy group: diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`), hydrolysis to a phenol (`H3O+/Heat`), and Williamson ether synthesis (`NaOH/EtBr`). This successfully yields the target molecule.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile Option D contains a step (ii) that is not high-yield for the required starting isomer, it is the only sequence that is chemically sound and leads to the correctly named target molecule. Options A, B, and C are incorrect due to fundamental flaws: failed reactions, impossible reaction sequences, or synthesis of the wrong isomer. In the context of a multiple-choice question where one answer must be the best, the chemically possible (though imperfect) pathway is the correct choice over those that are chemically impossible.\n\n<<<D>>>"

The requirement for a \"high-yield\" synthesis means that any route relying on the separation of a minor isomer is likely incorrect, and that the sequence of reactions must be highly regioselective.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Each Option for Chemical Feasibility\nWe must eliminate any option that contains a chemically impossible step or uses a fundamentally flawed strategy.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    This sequence involves forming nitrobenzene (i), then aniline (ii), and then attempting a Friedel-Crafts alkylation (iii). The Friedel-Crafts reaction fails on the deactivated aniline ring because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) complexes with the basic amino group. **This option is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    This option has a fatal flaw in its ordering. Step (iv) is a diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`), which requires an amino (-NH2) group. However, the substrate after step (iii) (a sulfonated nitro compound) does not have an amino group. A reaction cannot be performed on a functional group that does not exist. **This option is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    This option begins with a classic blocking group strategy.\n    1.  Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene\n    2.  Sulfonation -> 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (blocking the para position).\n    3.  Nitration -> This gives 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.\n    *   **Crucial Flaw:** In this key intermediate, the tert-butyl and nitro groups are *meta* (1,3 relationship) to each other. The target molecule requires them to be *ortho* (1,2 relationship). Therefore, this entire strategy, while high-yield, produces the wrong isomer. Furthermore, later in the sequence (step vi), it attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt, which is nonsensical. **This option is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    This is the only remaining option. Let's trace its chemical pathway.\n    1.  **i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` on benzene → tert-butylbenzene.** (Standard reaction).\n    2.  **ii) `HNO3/H2SO4` on tert-butylbenzene.** This gives a mixture of ortho- and para-nitrated products. The para isomer is major. To reach the target, one must proceed with the **minor ortho isomer** (`1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene`). This step contradicts the \"high-yield\" requirement but is chemically possible.\n    3.  **iii) `Fe/HCl` on 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene → 2-tert-butylaniline.** (Standard reduction).\n    4.  **iv) `HNO3/H2SO4` on 2-tert-butylaniline.** This is the key step. In strong acid, the aniline is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+). The -NH3+ group (at C1) is a meta-director. The -tBu group (at C2) is an o,p-director. The directing effects are cooperative, both pushing the incoming nitro group to position C3, yielding **3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline**. This creates the required 1,2,3-pattern.\n    5.  **v) `NaNO2/HCl` →** Diazotization of the amino group.\n    6.  **vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat` →** Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to form the phenol (`2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol`).\n    7.  **vii) `NaOH/EtBr` →** Williamson ether synthesis gives the target molecule, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. The final two steps listed (viii, ix) are superfluous distractors.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOptions B, C, and D are invalid because they contain chemically impossible reaction steps or are based on strategies that definitively lead to the wrong isomers. Option A describes the only sequence that is chemically capable of producing the correct target molecule. Its primary weakness is the non-selective nitration in step (ii), which violates the \"high-yield\" criterion. However, given that it is the only chemically logical and coherent pathway among the choices, it must be the intended answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\n### Step-by-step Analysis of the Synthesis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Target Molecule**:\n    The target is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    *   **Substituents**: Ethoxy (-OEt), tert-Butyl (-tBu), Nitro (-NO2).\n    *   **Substitution Pattern**: The groups are at positions C1, C2, and C3 respectively. This is a vicinal or 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern.\n    *   **Directing Effects**: -OEt and -tBu are ortho,para-directors. -NO2 is a meta-director. The protonated amine (-NH3+), a likely intermediate, is a meta-director.\n    *   **Challenge**: The \"high-yield\" synthesis of a sterically crowded 1,2,3-isomer is non-trivial and requires precise control over the reaction sequence. A simple sequential addition of groups is unlikely to work due to competing directing effects.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Core Synthetic Strategies**:\n    There are two main strategies to consider for forming the required relationship between the substituents.\n\n    *   **Strategy 1: Using the major isomer from the first nitration (The \"Typo\" Hypothesis)**.\n        1.  Alkylation: Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene.\n        2.  Nitration: This reaction is high-yield, but the major product is **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene** due to the steric hindrance of the tert-butyl group.\n        3.  Following a high-yield sequence from this intermediate (`reduction -> second nitration -> diazotization -> hydrolysis -> etherification`) produces **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**. This is a 1,2,4-isomer, not the requested 1,2,3-isomer. This strategy, while high-yield, leads to the wrong product.\n\n    *   **Strategy 2: A pathway to the correct isomer (The \"Low-Yield Step\" Hypothesis)**.\n        This is the only pathway discussed that can produce the correctly named molecule.\n        1.  **`i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` on benzene -> `tert-butylbenzene`**: A standard Friedel-Crafts reaction.\n        2.  **`ii) HNO3/H2SO4` on tert-butylbenzene -> `1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene`**: This is the key step. While the para isomer is major, the *ortho* isomer is also formed. To make the target product, we must proceed with this **minor isomer**. This step violates the \"high-yield\" criterion, but it is chemically necessary.\n        3.  **`iii) Fe/HCl` -> `2-tert-butylaniline`**: Standard reduction of the nitro group to an amine.\n        4.  **`iv) HNO3/H2SO4` -> `3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline`**: This is a crucial regiochemical step. Under the strong acid of nitrating mixture, the amine at C1 is protonated to an anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group at C2 is an *ortho,para*-director. Both the -NH3+ and -tBu groups direct the incoming nitro group to position C3. Because the directors are cooperative, this step is plausible and sets up the required 1,2,3 pattern.\n        5.  **`v) NaNO2/HCl`**: Diazotization of the amine.\n        6.  **`vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat`**: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to form a phenol (`3-nitro-2-tert-butylphenol`).\n        7.  **`vii) NaOH/EtBr`**: Williamson ether synthesis to convert the phenol into the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n3.  **Conclusion and Final Decision**:\n    *   Strategies that start with a blocking group (sulfonation) or proceed through the major para-nitro isomer lead definitively to the wrong final product isomers.\n    *   Strategy 2 is the only pathway that produces the correctly named molecule. Its primary flaw is the low yield of the ortho-nitration step (step ii). However, the subsequent steps are chemically sound.\n    *   In multiple-choice chemistry questions of this nature, a pathway that is chemically possible but violates a condition like \"high-yield\" is often considered more correct than a pathway that is high-yield but leads to a completely different molecule. The question is testing the knowledge of the transformations required to build the target structure.\n    *   The sequence of reagents outlined in Strategy 2 is contained within **Option A** as presented by most candidate answers (the final steps `viii` and `ix` are superfluous distractors). This makes it the only plausible, albeit imperfect, choice.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nAnswering this question requires a multi-faceted analysis of organic synthesis principles, focusing on regiochemistry, reaction feasibility, and the \"high-yield\" constraint.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruction of the Target Molecule\nThe target is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** It is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring. This vicinal (adjacent) pattern is often synthetically challenging.\n*   **Substituents and their Relationships:**\n    *   C1: Ethoxy (-OEt), a strong activator and *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   C2: tert-Butyl (-tBu), a bulky activator and *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   C3: Nitro (-NO2), a strong deactivator and *meta*-director.\n*   **Key Insight:** The most difficult part of the synthesis is establishing the *ortho* relationship between the bulky tert-butyl group and the nitro group in high yield.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluation of Potential Synthetic Strategies\nWe will analyze the three main strategies discussed across the candidate answers.\n\n1.  **Direct Nitration Strategy (Flawed):**\n    *   Path: `tert-Butylbenzene → (Nitration) → ...`\n    *   Analysis: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene produces primarily the *para* isomer due to the large steric hindrance of the tert-butyl group. The desired *ortho* isomer is a minor product. Any synthesis relying on this initial step cannot be \"high-yield\" and is therefore incorrect according to the problem's constraints.\n\n2.  **Blocking Group Strategy (Leads to the Wrong Isomer):**\n    *   Path: `tert-Butylbenzene → (Sulfonation) → 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid → (Nitration) ...`\n    *   Analysis: This is a powerful high-yield strategy. Sulfonation blocks the *para* position. Subsequent nitration is directed by both the tBu group (directs *ortho*) and the -SO3H group (directs *meta*) to the same positions. This yields `4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`.\n    *   **Crucial Flaw:** While this creates an *ortho* relationship between the tBu and NO2 groups as required, this pathway cannot be easily completed to yield the final product. More importantly, many simpler blocking group strategies that might be envisioned lead to an intermediate where the tBu and NO2 groups are *meta* to each other, which is incorrect.\n\n3.  **The Advanced \"Toolkit\" Strategy (Correct but Complex):**\n    *   A genuinely high-yield synthesis of this specific molecule requires a more complex route. The key is to recognize the full set of reactions required to control the placement of all three groups.\n    *   **Plausible High-Yield Path:**\n        1.  Alkylation (`tBuCl/AlCl3`)\n        2.  Sulfonation (blocking group) (`SO3/H2SO4`)\n        3.  First Nitration (`HNO3/H2SO4`) to install the first NO2 group.\n        4.  Second Nitration (`HNO3/H2SO4`) to install a second NO2 group.\n        5.  Selective Reduction (`Fe/HCl`) of one NO2 group to an amine.\n        6.  Desulfonation (unblocking) (`dilute H2SO4`)\n        7.  Conversion of the amine to the final ethoxy group via diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`), hydrolysis (`H3O+/Heat`), and etherification (`NaOH/EtBr`).\n    *   **Insight:** This sophisticated path is the only one that is both high-yield and leads to the correct product. The problem then becomes: which option provides the necessary \"toolkit\" of reagents to perform this synthesis?\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of the Options as Reagent Toolkits\n\nWe must check which option provides all the necessary reagents for the correct advanced synthesis, regardless of the jumbled order in which they are presented.\n\n*   **Required Reagents:** `tBuCl/AlCl3`, `SO3/H2SO4`, `dilute H2SO4`, `Fe/HCl`, `NaNO2/HCl`, `H3O+/Heat`, `NaOH/EtBr`, and crucially, **two separate nitration steps (`HNO3/H2SO4`)**.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Given Options:**\n    *   Option A: Contains only one `HNO3/H2SO4` step. It lacks the reagents for the correct pathway.\n    *   Option B: Contains only one `HNO3/H2SO4` step and nonsensical ordering.\n    *   **Option C**: Its reagent list is: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4`. This is the **only option** that provides two distinct `HNO3/H2SO4` reagents, along with all other required components for the valid, high-yield synthesis.\n    *   Option D: Contains only one `HNO3/H2SO4` step.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nWhile the sequence listed in Option C is chemically illogical, it is the only option that contains the complete set of reagents necessary for the only plausible high-yield synthesis of the target molecule. In complex synthesis problems of this type, the answer often lies in identifying the necessary \"toolkit\" rather than a perfectly ordered list.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\n**Analysis of the Task**\n\nThe goal is to determine the single best reaction sequence for the \"high-yield\" synthesis of **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene** from benzene. This involves a careful analysis of the target molecule's structure and a step-by-step evaluation of the chemical feasibility and regiochemistry of each proposed pathway.\n\n**1. Deconstruction of the Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent substituents (a vicinal, or 1,2,3-pattern).\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt), a strong *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu), a bulky *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2), a strong *meta*-director.\n*   **Synthetic Challenge:** The 1,2,3-substitution pattern is sterically crowded and electronically difficult to achieve directly. The \"high-yield\" requirement suggests that any path relying on the separation of a minor isomer is unlikely to be correct, and that regioselectivity at each step is critical.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Evaluation of Proposed Synthetic Strategies**\n\nWe will evaluate the main strategies present in the candidate options:\n\n*   **Strategy Based on Friedel-Crafts on Aniline (Option C):** This route attempts to nitrate benzene, reduce it to aniline, and then perform a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. This strategy fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, deactivating the ring and making the alkylation step fail or have extremely low yield. Therefore, this is not a valid high-yield pathway.\n\n*   **Strategy Based on Flawed Sequencing (Options B, D):** These options contain chemically impossible steps in their sequences. For example, they propose using `NaNO2/HCl` (a reagent for diazotization of an amine) on a molecule that has no amino group, or attempting to nitrate a highly unstable diazonium salt intermediate. These sequences are chemically nonsensical.\n\n*   **Strategy Based on a \"High-Yield\" Pathway to the Wrong Isomer:** A common high-yield approach is to alkylate benzene to tert-butylbenzene, then nitrate it. The major product is `1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene`. Further functionalization of this major isomer is high-yield but leads to a **1,2,4-substituted product**, not the required 1,2,3-isomer. While this is a sound synthesis, it does not produce the target molecule. This suggests the possibility of a typo in the question's target molecule name, but we must first evaluate if any option can produce the stated target.\n\n*   **Strategy Based on the correct Functional Group Conversions (Option A):** This option is the only one remaining after eliminating the others based on fundamental chemical errors. Let's trace its path carefully:\n    1.  **i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` on benzene → tert-butylbenzene.** (Standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation).\n    2.  **ii) `HNO3/H2SO4` on tert-butylbenzene →** This nitration step produces a mixture. To obtain the desired product, one must proceed with the **minor isomer**, `1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene`. While this step is not \"high-yield,\" it is a necessary step in the only plausible pathway.\n    3.  **iii) `Fe/HCl` on 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene → `2-tert-butylaniline`**. (Standard nitro reduction).\n    4.  **iv) `HNO3/H2SO4` on 2-tert-butylaniline →** This is the key step to set the 1,2,3 pattern. Under strong acidic conditions, the amine at C1 is protonated to `-NH3+`, a *meta*-director. This directs the incoming nitro group to position C3, creating `3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline`.\n    5.  **v) `NaNO2/HCl` on 3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline →** Diazotization of the amino group.\n    6.  **vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat` on the diazonium salt → `3-nitro-2-tert-butylphenol`**. (Standard hydrolysis of a diazonium salt).\n    7.  **vii) `NaOH/EtBr` on 3-nitro-2-tert-butylphenol → `2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene`**. (Standard Williamson ether synthesis). The final product is correct.\n    8.  **viii) & ix)** The final two steps are superfluous and serve as distractors.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Options B, C, and D are invalid because they contain chemically impossible reaction steps or follow a fundamentally flawed strategy.\n*   Option A describes a sequence of chemically correct transformations that successfully produces the target molecule. Its primary weakness is the low yield of the ortho-nitration in step (ii), which contradicts the \"high-yield\" specification in the question.\n*   However, in the context of a multiple-choice question, a pathway that is chemically possible (even if one step has low yield) is superior to pathways that are chemically impossible or definitively lead to the wrong product. Therefore, by elimination, Option A represents the only viable synthesis among the choices.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the best possible answer.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Target Molecule**\n\nThe first step is to carefully examine the target molecule: **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n*   **Structure:** It is a benzene ring with three adjacent (vicinal) substituents.\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt), a strong *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu), a bulky *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2), a strong *meta*-director.\n*   **Key Challenge:** The question specifies a **\"high-yield\"** synthesis. This is a critical constraint. Creating a 1,2,3-trisubstituted ring, especially one as crowded as this, in high yield is very difficult. Standard electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) often produces a mixture of isomers, which would violate the \"high-yield\" condition.\n\n**2. Evaluate Potential Synthetic Strategies**\n\nBased on the reagents provided in the options, there are two main strategic approaches to consider for establishing the key relationships between the groups.\n\n*   **Strategy 1: The \"Blocking Group\" Approach**\n    *   This is a common, powerful strategy for high-yield synthesis. It involves adding the tert-butyl group, blocking the sterically-favored *para* position with a sulfonic acid group (`-SO3H`), and then performing nitration.\n    *   **The Flaw:** As several analyses correctly point out, this sequence (alkylation -> para-sulfonation -> nitration) results in an intermediate where the tert-butyl and nitro groups are *meta* to each other. The target molecule requires them to be *ortho*. Therefore, this otherwise excellent high-yield strategy leads to the wrong isomer and cannot be the correct answer.\n\n*   **Strategy 2: The Sequential Substitution Approach**\n    This approach involves a sequence of additions and functional group modifications. There are two versions of this strategy depending on the first nitration step.\n    *   **Path A (Following the Major Product - Truly High Yield):**\n        1.  Alkylation: Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene.\n        2.  Nitration: Gives the major product, **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene** (high yield).\n        3.  Reduction -> 4-tert-butylaniline.\n        4.  Nitration -> 2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline (high-yield, directors are cooperative).\n        5.  This path leads cleanly and in high yield to a **1,2,4-isomer**, specifically `1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene`. This does not match the named target molecule. This suggests a potential typo in the question itself.\n\n    *   **Path B (Following the Minor Product - Not High Yield):**\n        1.  Alkylation: Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene.\n        2.  Nitration: Isolate the minor product, **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**. This step is inherently **low-yield**.\n        3.  Reduction -> 2-tert-butylaniline.\n        4.  Nitration: This is the key regiochemical step. Under strong acid, the amine is protonated to -NH3+, a *meta*-director. The t-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position C3, creating the necessary **3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline**.\n        5.  Subsequent steps (diazotization, hydrolysis, etherification) convert this intermediate into the final target molecule.\n\n**3. Final Decision Logic**\n\nWe are faced with a choice between:\n*   An incorrect strategy (Blocking Group).\n*   A valid, high-yield strategy that produces the wrong molecule, suggesting a typo in the question (Path A).\n*   A chemically plausible strategy that produces the correct molecule but violates the \"high-yield\" constraint at a key step (Path B).\n\nIn a multiple-choice chemistry problem, a pathway that is chemically possible, even if one step is inefficient, is preferable to a pathway that is chemically impossible or definitively leads to the wrong product. Path B is the only sequence of reactions discussed that can logically result in the formation of **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. The sequences in the options that match this series of transformations are the most likely intended answer, despite the \"high-yield\" language being flawed.\n\nThe sequence of reactions in Path B is: `Alkylation -> Nitration -> Reduction -> Nitration -> Diazotization/Hydrolysis -> Etherification`. Option A from the candidates describes exactly these transformations in steps (i) through (vii). The final steps (viii, ix) are superfluous distractors. Therefore, this sequence represents the only viable route among the choices to the named product.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nAn analysis of the provided answers reveals a complex organic synthesis problem with several potential pitfalls and likely a flaw in the question's premise. To determine the best answer, we must break down the synthesis logically.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule\n*   **Name:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Structure:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted (vicinal) benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents and their Directing Effects:**\n    *   C1: Ethoxy (-OEt) - a strong activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   C2: tert-Butyl (-tBu) - a weakly activating, *ortho, para*-director that is very bulky.\n    *   C3: Nitro (-NO2) - a strong deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **Key Challenge:** The \"high-yield\" requirement is critical. Synthesizing a sterically crowded 1,2,3-isomer is difficult, and any path relying on the separation of a minor product would not be considered \"high-yield\".\n\n### 2. Evaluation of Proposed Synthetic Strategies\n\nThere are three main strategies that emerge from analyzing the candidate answers:\n\n*   **Strategy 1: Using a Sulfonic Acid Blocking Group.** This is a common and powerful technique for controlling regiochemistry. The path would be: Alkylation (tBu) -> Sulfonation (to block the para position) -> Nitration.\n    *   **Flaw:** As correctly identified by several analyses, this strategy leads to an intermediate where the tert-butyl and nitro groups are *meta* to each other (e.g., 2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid). The target molecule requires these groups to be *ortho*. Therefore, this entire strategy, while high-yield, leads to the wrong isomer and cannot be correct.\n\n*   **Strategy 2: The \"Typo\" Hypothesis (High-Yield Path).** This assumes the target molecule was intended to be the more easily synthesized 1,2,4-isomer.\n    1.  **i) Friedel-Crafts Alkylation** to make tert-butylbenzene.\n    2.  **ii) Nitration:** The major, high-yield product is **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene** due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group.\n    3.  **iii) Reduction:** of the nitro group to an amine.\n    4.  **iv) Second Nitration:** Nitration of 4-tert-butylaniline is highly regioselective, giving 2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline.\n    5.  **v, vi, vii) Conversion:** The amino group is converted to the final ethoxy group via diazotization, hydrolysis to a phenol, and Williamson ether synthesis.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a sound, high-yield synthesis for **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**. If the question contains a typo in the target's name, this is the intended chemical pathway. This sequence of reaction types is described by option A.\n\n*   **Strategy 3: The \"Minor Isomer\" Path (Correct Product).** This strategy aims to produce the exact molecule named in the question.\n    1.  **i) Friedel-Crafts Alkylation** to make tert-butylbenzene.\n    2.  **ii) Nitration:** This step produces a mixture. To proceed, one must isolate the **minor ortho isomer**, 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene. **This step is not high-yield**, contradicting the question's premise.\n    3.  **iii) Reduction:** of the nitro group to give 2-tert-butylaniline.\n    4.  **iv) Second Nitration:** This is a key regiochemical step. The amino group at C1 is protonated to the meta-directing anilinium ion (-NH3+), and the t-butyl group at C2 is an o,p-director. The directing effects are cooperative, both pointing to C3. This makes the formation of the required **3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline** plausible.\n    5.  **v, vi, vii) Conversion:** The amino group is transformed into the final ethoxy group as in Strategy 2.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This pathway successfully produces the target molecule. Its major flaw is the low-yield first nitration step. This sequence of reaction types is also perfectly described by option A.\n\n### 3. Final Decision\n\n*   Options B, C, and D are demonstrably flawed, as they contain chemically impossible or nonsensical steps (e.g., Friedel-Crafts on aniline, diazotizing a molecule without an amine).\n*   Option A describes a sequence of reactions that is chemically logical. The superfluous steps at the end (viii, ix) are distractors.\n*   The sequence in Option A can be interpreted in two ways: as a high-yield synthesis of the wrong molecule (Strategy 2), or a lower-yield synthesis of the correct molecule (Strategy 3).\n*   In a multiple-choice context where only one answer can be the best, a sequence that is chemically viable but imperfect (due to a low-yield step) is far superior to sequences that are chemically impossible. Since the path described in Option A is the only one that can lead to the named product, it must be the intended answer, despite the \"high-yield\" claim being questionable.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the best answer.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Challenge\n\n*   **Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Structure:** It is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring. The three substituents (-OEt, -tBu, -NO2) are all adjacent to one another.\n*   **Key Relationships:**\n    *   The tert-butyl (-tBu) group is *ortho* to both the ethoxy (-OEt) and nitro (-NO2) groups.\n    *   The ethoxy (-OEt) group and the nitro (-NO2) group are *meta* to each other.\n*   **Challenge:** The question demands a **\"high-yield\"** synthesis. This is a crucial constraint. Creating a crowded 1,2,3-isomer with high yield is difficult because standard reactions often produce mixtures of isomers. We must find a pathway where each step is highly efficient and regioselective (i.e., it produces one desired isomer in a much greater amount than others).\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate the Plausibility of the Starting Sequences\n\nAll four options provided are permutations of the same nine reaction steps. The key difference is the *order* of the initial steps, which defines the entire synthetic strategy. Let's analyze the opening strategy of each option.\n\n*   **Option D:** Starts with `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`.\n    *   This sequence attempts to perform a Friedel-Crafts alkylation (step iii) on aniline (the product of steps i and ii). This reaction fails or gives very low yields because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, deactivating the aromatic ring. This is not a viable high-yield strategy. **Therefore, Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B and C:** Both start with `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4`.\n    *   This sequence involves the direct nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The -tBu group is an *ortho, para*-director, but because it is very bulky, substitution at the *para* position is heavily favored over the more sterically hindered *ortho* position.\n    *   To get to the target molecule, one would need to isolate the minor *ortho*-nitro product and carry it forward. A synthesis that relies on isolating a minor product at a key early step cannot be considered \"high-yield\". **Therefore, Options B and C begin with a flawed strategy.**\n\n*   **Option A:** Starts with `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4`.\n    *   This is a classic and powerful **blocking group strategy**.\n    1.  **Alkylation:** Benzene is converted to tert-butylbenzene.\n    2.  **Sulfonation:** The sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) is installed. It preferentially adds to the *para* position, which is sterically accessible and electronically activated by the -tBu group. This step effectively \"blocks\" the most reactive site, yielding 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n    3.  **Nitration:** Now, the ring is nitrated. Let's analyze the directing effects on the intermediate (numbering with -SO3H at C1, -tBu at C4):\n        *   The -tBu group (at C4) directs incoming groups to its *ortho* positions (C3 and C5).\n        *   The -SO3H group (at C1) directs incoming groups to its *meta* positions (C3 and C5).\n        *   The directing effects are **cooperative**, forcing the nitro group to add to position C3 (or C5) with very high selectivity. This gives 3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n    *   This initial three-step sequence is highly regioselective and produces the critical intermediate, where the -tBu and -NO2 groups are *ortho* to each other, in high yield. This is the only opening strategy presented that satisfies the \"high-yield\" requirement for creating the necessary substitution pattern.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\nWhile the later steps in Option A are not listed in a fully logical order, its initial strategic sequence (Alkylation → Blocking with Sulfonation → Controlled Nitration) is the only one among the choices that is chemically sound for a **high-yield** synthesis of an intermediate with the required ortho-tert-butyl-nitro relationship. The other options either begin with a fundamentally flawed chemical step (D) or a non-selective, low-yield step (B and C). In a complex synthesis problem, the choice of the correct initial strategy is paramount. Option A is the only one that demonstrates the correct high-yield approach from the beginning.\n\nThe complete, high-yield synthesis is very complex, requiring two nitrations and selective functional group transformations, but it is plausible. Option A is the only one that contains the necessary reagents for such a path and, most importantly, begins with the correct regiochemical control steps.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\nThe first step is to carefully deconstruct the target molecule to understand the synthetic challenges.\n*   **Name:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent (vicinal) substituents.\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt), a strong activator and *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   Position 2: Tert-butyl group (-tBu), a bulky activator and *ortho, para*-director that strongly favors para-substitution.\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2), a strong deactivator and *meta*-director.\n*   **Key Challenge:** The question asks for a \"high-yield\" synthesis. The 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern is sterically crowded and electronically complex, making a high-yield synthesis non-trivial. The conflicting directing effects of the substituents must be carefully managed.\n\n### 2. Evaluate the Proposed Synthetic Pathways in the Options\n\nLet's evaluate the primary strategy of each option to check for chemical feasibility and whether it can produce the target in high yield.\n\n*   **Option A: The Blocking Group Strategy**\n    *   **Sequence:** i) Alkylation (tBu), ii) Sulfonation (-SO3H), iii) Nitration (-NO2) ...\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a classic and powerful strategy to control regiochemistry. Step (i) produces tert-butylbenzene. Step (ii) places a sulfonic acid group at the para position (the most favored site), yielding 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. In step (iii), nitration occurs. The -tBu group directs ortho, and the -SO3H group directs meta; both direct the incoming -NO2 group to position 2. This gives 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** In this key intermediate, the t-butyl and nitro groups are *meta* to each other. The target molecule requires them to be *ortho*. Therefore, this strategy, while high-yield, leads to the wrong isomer and cannot produce the target molecule. **Option A is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D: Friedel-Crafts on a Deactivated Ring**\n    *   **Sequence:** i) Nitration (-NO2), ii) Reduction to Aniline (-NH2), iii) Alkylation (tBu) ...\n    *   **Analysis:** This pathway starts by creating aniline. Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. This reaction fails or gives extremely poor yields because the basic amino group of aniline reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), forming a complex that strongly deactivates the benzene ring. This is not a viable high-yield reaction. **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B: Scrambled / Nonsensical Steps**\n    *   **Sequence:** The order of reactions is chemically illogical. It lists two nitration steps (ii and vi in some interpretations) and includes diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`) without having first formed a primary amine in a plausible sequence. As written, it is not a valid synthetic route. **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C: The Direct Sequential Substitution Strategy**\n    *   **Sequence:** i) Alkylation (tBu), ii) Nitration, iii) Reduction, iv) Second Nitration ...\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the only remaining option. Let's trace the pathway step-by-step:\n        1.  **i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` on benzene -> tert-butylbenzene.** (Standard reaction).\n        2.  **ii) `HNO3/H2SO4` on tert-butylbenzene.** This step gives a mixture of ortho- and para-nitrated products. The para-isomer is the major product (~70-80%), while the required ortho-isomer is the minor product (~15-20%). To reach the final target, we *must* proceed with the minor **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**. This step conflicts with the \"high-yield\" requirement, but it is the only chemically possible route to the target among the choices.\n        3.  **iii) `Fe/HCl` on 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene -> 2-tert-butylaniline.** (Standard reduction).\n        4.  **iv) `HNO3/H2SO4` on 2-tert-butylaniline.** This is the crucial step that sets the 1,2,3 pattern. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a *meta*-director. The t-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director. In this specific case, both groups direct the incoming nitro group to position C3, allowing for the formation of **3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline**.\n        5.  **v -> vii) Conversion of the amino group.** The remaining steps are a standard sequence: `v) Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl)` -> `vi) Hydrolysis (H3O+/Heat)` to form the phenol -> `vii) Williamson Ether Synthesis (NaOH/EtBr)` to form the final ethoxy group. This sequence successfully yields the target molecule, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile Option C involves a step (the initial ortho-nitration) that is not high-yield, it is the only sequence presented that is not invalidated by a fundamental chemical flaw. The other options either lead definitively to the wrong isomer (A), rely on a reaction that fails (D), or are chemically nonsensical as written (B). Therefore, in the context of choosing the best possible answer, the sequence that actually produces the target molecule, even if imperfectly, is the correct choice.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\n### Analysis of the Synthetic Problem\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Target Molecule**\n*   **Name:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent (vicinal) substituents.\n    *   C1: -OEt (ethoxy group), a strong activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   C2: -tBu (tert-butyl group), a bulky activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   C3: -NO2 (nitro group), a strong deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **Key Challenge:** The question specifies a **\"high-yield\"** synthesis of this sterically crowded 1,2,3-isomer. This is a significant challenge due to competing directing effects and steric hindrance.\n\n### 2. Evaluate the Plausible Synthetic Strategies\n\nBased on the candidate answers and chemical principles, three main strategies are proposed.\n\n**Strategy A: The \"Blocking Group\" Approach**\n1.  Start with Friedel-Crafts alkylation to get tert-butylbenzene.\n2.  Use sulfonation (`SO3/H2SO4`) to block the sterically favored *para* position. This gives 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n3.  Perform nitration. Both the -tBu and -SO3H groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same position, yielding **3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   **Fatal Flaw:** While this establishes the necessary *ortho* relationship between the tert-butyl and nitro groups, the sulfonic acid group (the precursor to the final ethoxy group) is in the wrong position. This intermediate has a 1,3,4 substitution pattern, which cannot be converted into the target 1,2,3 pattern. Thus, this high-yield strategy leads to the wrong isomer.\n\n**Strategy B: The \"High-Yield Isomer\" Approach**\n1.  Start with Friedel-Crafts alkylation to get tert-butylbenzene.\n2.  Perform nitration. The major product (formed in high yield) is the *para* isomer, **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene**.\n3.  A series of high-yield steps (reduction of -NO2, second nitration *ortho* to the resulting amino group, and converting the amino group to ethoxy) will cleanly produce **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**.\n*   **Fatal Flaw:** This is a sound, high-yield synthesis, but it produces a 1,2,4-isomer, not the named 1,2,3-isomer. This path is only correct if the question contains a typo in the target molecule's name.\n\n**Strategy C: The \"Correct Product via Low-Yield Step\" Approach**\nThis is the only proposed strategy that can lead to the correctly named target molecule.\n1.  **Alkylation:** Benzene → **tert-butylbenzene**.\n2.  **Nitration:** Perform nitration of tert-butylbenzene. Isolate the **minor ortho-isomer**, `1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene`. *This step is inherently NOT high-yield, which contradicts the question's premise*.\n3.  **Reduction:** Reduce the nitro group to an amine (`Fe/HCl`) to get **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n4.  **Second Nitration:** This is the key regiochemical step. Under the strong acidic conditions of nitration (`HNO3/H2SO4`), the amino group is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+). The -NH3+ group (at C1) is a *meta*-director. The -tBu group (at C2) is an *ortho, para*-director. The directing effects of both groups cooperate, guiding the incoming nitro group to position **C3**. This gives the required `3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline`.\n5.  **Functional Group Conversion:** The amino group is converted to the final ethoxy group via a standard sequence: diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`), hydrolysis to a phenol (`H3O+/Heat`), and Williamson ether synthesis (`NaOH/EtBr`).\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Strategies A and B are fundamentally flawed because they lead to the wrong final isomers, despite being high-yield.\n*   Strategy C is the only chemically plausible route to the specified target molecule. Its major weakness is the low-yield ortho-nitration step at the beginning. However, in the context of a flawed multiple-choice question, a pathway that is chemically possible (even if imperfect) is the correct answer over pathways that are chemically impossible or lead to the wrong product.\n*   Most candidate answers that correctly analyze the problem arrive at this conclusion, identifying Strategy C as the only viable option. The consensus of reasoning points to the sequence: **Alkylation → Nitration → Reduction → Second Nitration → Diazotization/Hydrolysis → Etherification.**\n*   While the letter designations (A, B, C, D) are assigned inconsistently in the provided candidate responses, the chemical reasoning points overwhelmingly to one specific pathway. The sequence presented in **Option A** of the provided answers (steps i through vii, ignoring the nonsensical final steps) matches the plausible, if imperfect, synthesis of the target molecule via a second nitration of an aniline derivative.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct sequence of reactions for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Target Molecule\nFirst, we must understand the structure of the final product and the synthetic challenges it presents.\n*   **Name:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent (vicinal) substituents:\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt), a strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu), a weakly activating, *ortho, para*-director. It is sterically bulky.\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2), a strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **Key Challenge:** The question demands a **\"high-yield\"** synthesis. The 1,2,3-substitution pattern is often difficult to achieve in high yield due to competing electronic effects and steric hindrance.\n\n### 2. Evaluate Each Option for Chemical Feasibility\n\nWe will now analyze each proposed reaction sequence to determine its validity.\n\n*   **Option B: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`**\n    This sequence is chemically impossible as written. Step (iv), diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`), requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2) as the starting material. The intermediate formed after step (iii) does not have an amine group. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C: `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`**\n    This sequence begins by forming aniline (`i` and `ii`). Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. This reaction fails or proceeds with very low yield because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, deactivating the ring towards further electrophilic substitution. This is not a viable high-yield pathway.\n\n*   **Option D: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`**\n    This sequence employs a common blocking group strategy. Let's trace the regiochemistry:\n    1.  `i) & ii)`: tert-Butylbenzene is sulfonated, blocking the sterically favored *para* position to yield `4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`.\n    2.  `iii) HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration occurs. The t-butyl group (at C4) directs ortho, and the sulfonic acid group (at C1) directs meta. Both direct the incoming nitro group to position 2, forming `2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`.\n    3.  **Crucial Flaw:** In this key intermediate, the t-butyl group and the nitro group are **meta** to each other. The target molecule requires them to be **ortho**. Therefore, this entire strategy, while high-yield, leads to the wrong isomer and cannot be correct.\n\n*   **Option A: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`**\n    By elimination, this is the only remaining possibility. Let's trace its chemical pathway:\n    1.  **Step i:** `Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` → **tert-Butylbenzene**. (Standard Friedel-Crafts)\n    2.  **Step ii:** `tert-Butylbenzene + HNO3/H2SO4`. This nitration produces a mixture of ortho and para isomers. To synthesize the target molecule, we must proceed with the minor **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene** (ortho) product. This step is a weakness regarding the \"high-yield\" claim, but let's continue as it's the only path to the correct skeletal structure.\n    3.  **Step iii:** `... + Fe/HCl`. The nitro group is reduced to an amine, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Standard reduction)\n    4.  **Step iv:** `2-tert-butylaniline + HNO3/H2SO4`. This is the key step to install the third group. Under strong acid, the aniline becomes the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a *meta*-director. The -NH3+ at C1 directs the new nitro group to C3. The t-butyl group at C2 also directs to an adjacent vacant position (C3). The directing effects are thus cooperative, leading to the formation of **3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline** and setting up the required 1,2,3-pattern.\n    5.  **Steps v-vii:** This is a standard sequence to convert a primary aromatic amine to an ethoxy group:\n        *   `v) NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization to a diazonium salt.\n        *   `vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat`: Hydrolysis to a phenol (`2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol`).\n        *   `vii) NaOH/EtBr`: Williamson ether synthesis to yield the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    6.  **Steps viii & ix:** These are superfluous steps at the end of the sequence, likely added as distractors.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile Option A's claim to be \"high-yield\" is questionable due to the initial ortho/para separation required in step (ii), it is the only option that presents a chemically coherent and logical sequence of reactions that successfully produces the correctly named target molecule. The other options are invalidated by either chemically impossible reactions or by employing a strategy that definitively leads to the wrong isomer. Therefore, in the context of choosing the best answer from the given list, Option A is the only viable choice.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\n### Analysis of the Synthetic Problem\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Target Molecule:**\n    *   **Name:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n    *   **Structure:** This is a benzene ring with three adjacent (vicinal) substituents:\n        *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt), an activating *ortho, para*-director.\n        *   Position 2: Tert-butyl group (-tBu), a bulky activating *ortho, para*-director.\n        *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2), a deactivating *meta*-director.\n    *   **Key Challenge:** The question specifies a \"high-yield\" synthesis. Creating a crowded 1,2,3-substituted ring in high yield is very difficult. The steric hindrance is significant, and the electronic directing effects of the groups must be carefully controlled. The key part of the synthesis is establishing the *ortho* relationship between the bulky tert-butyl group and the nitro group.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Each Option for Chemical Viability and Yield:**\n\n    *   **Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...**\n        *   This sequence attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation (step iii) on aniline (formed in steps i and ii). This reaction works very poorly or fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) complexes with the basic amino group of aniline, deactivating the ring towards electrophilic substitution. This is not a viable high-yield route. **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n    *   **Option B: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n        *   This sequence employs a blocking group strategy. Step (ii) adds a sulfonic acid group (`-SO3H`) to the *para* position of tert-butylbenzene, blocking it. In step (iii), nitration occurs. The existing `-tBu` group (at C4) is an *ortho*-director, and the `-SO3H` group (at C1) is a *meta*-director. They both direct the incoming `-NO2` group to position 2.\n        *   The resulting intermediate is `4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`. In this molecule, the tert-butyl and nitro groups are *meta* to each other. The target molecule requires them to be *ortho*. This strategy, while high-yield, leads to the wrong isomer. **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n    *   **Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...**\n        *   This sequence is written in a chemically nonsensical order. Step (iv) uses `NaNO2/HCl`, the reagent for diazotization, which requires a primary amine (`-NH2`). The molecule produced after step (iii) has no amine group, so this reaction is impossible. **Option A is incorrect.**\n\n    *   **Option C: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...**\n        *   This is the only remaining possibility. Let's trace the reaction path:\n        1.  **Step (i):** Alkylation of benzene gives `tert-butylbenzene`.\n        2.  **Step (ii):** Nitration of `tert-butylbenzene`. This step is crucial. Due to the bulkiness of the t-butyl group, nitration heavily favors the *para* product. The desired *ortho* product is a minor isomer. This step explicitly violates the \"high-yield\" condition. However, let's assume we proceed with this minor isomer to see if the rest of the synthesis is plausible.\n        3.  **Step (iii):** Reduction of `1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene` gives `2-tert-butylaniline`.\n        4.  **Step (iv):** Nitration of `2-tert-butylaniline`. Under strong acid, the amine becomes `-NH3+` (at C1), which is a *meta*-director. The `-tBu` at C2 is an *o,p*-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position C3, creating `3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline`. This successfully establishes the 1,2,3-pattern.\n        5.  **Steps (v), (vi), (vii):** This is the standard sequence to convert the primary amine (`-NH2`) at C1 into an ethoxy group (`-OEt`) via a diazonium salt and phenol intermediate.\n        *   **Conclusion on Option C:** This sequence is chemically sound and leads to the correct final product. Its only major flaw is that step (ii) is not high-yield. However, since Options A, B, and D are incorrect due to impossible reactions or leading to the wrong product entirely, Option C remains the only plausible choice.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nIn a multiple-choice setting with potentially flawed questions, we must choose the *best* answer. Options A, B, and D are fundamentally incorrect because they are either chemically impossible or lead definitively to the wrong structural isomer. Option C describes a valid, albeit not perfectly high-yield, chemical pathway to the correct target molecule. By elimination, it is the best available answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nTo determine the correct reaction sequence, we must first understand the structure of the target molecule and the chemical challenge it presents.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Name:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Structure:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring. The substituents are an ethoxy group (-OEt) at C1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at C2, and a nitro group (-NO2) at C3.\n*   **Challenge:** The vicinal (adjacent) 1,2,3-substitution pattern is sterically crowded. The question specifies a **\"high-yield\"** synthesis, which means we must avoid pathways that produce significant amounts of unwanted isomers or that rely on low-yield reactions. Standard electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) often fails to produce such specific isomers in high yield.\n\n**2. Evaluate Potential Synthetic Strategies**\n\nLet's evaluate the main strategies that emerge from the reagents provided in the options.\n\n*   **Strategy A: Direct nitration of tert-butylbenzene (The \"ortho-isomer path\")**\n    1.  Start with tert-butylbenzene.\n    2.  Nitrate it directly. This yields mostly the *para*-nitro isomer, with the required *ortho*-nitro isomer as a minor product (~15-20%).\n    3.  Proceeding with this minor product violates the \"high-yield\" constraint from the very beginning. While this pathway *can* chemically lead to the final product through a sequence of steps (reduction, second nitration, diazotization, hydrolysis, etherification), it is not a high-yield synthesis.\n\n*   **Strategy B: Using a sulfonic acid blocking group (The \"meta-isomer path\")**\n    1.  Start with tert-butylbenzene.\n    2.  Block the favored *para* position with sulfonation (`SO3/H2SO4`).\n    3.  Nitrate the ring. Both the -tBu and -SO3H groups direct the new -NO2 group to the position that is *meta* to the t-butyl group.\n    4.  This is a high-yield strategy, but it produces an intermediate where the t-butyl and nitro groups are *meta* to each other. The target molecule requires them to be *ortho*. Therefore, this strategy leads to the wrong final product.\n\n*   **Strategy C: A complex, truly high-yield pathway**\n    There is an advanced, multi-step synthesis that can plausibly produce the target in high yield. This would be the intended answer for a difficult \"high-yield\" question.\n    1.  **Alkylation:** Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene\n    2.  **Blocking:** tert-Butylbenzene -> 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid\n    3.  **First Nitration:** This forces the nitro group *ortho* to the t-butyl group, giving 2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n    4.  **Second Nitration:** All existing groups synergistically direct a second nitro group to position 6, giving 2,6-dinitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n    5.  **Selective Reduction:** The less hindered nitro group at C6 is reduced to an amine (`-NH2`).\n    6.  **Deblocking:** The sulfonic acid group is removed with dilute acid. This yields `3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline`.\n    7.  **Functional Group Conversion:** The `-NH2` group is converted to `-OEt` via diazotization, hydrolysis to a phenol, and Williamson ether synthesis.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options as \"Reagent Toolkits\"**\n\nThe reaction steps in the options are listed in a nonsensical order. This is a common distraction in complex synthesis problems. The real task is to see which option provides the necessary set of reagents (the \"toolkit\") to perform a viable synthesis.\n\nLet's check the reagent list needed for the correct, high-yield Strategy C:\n*   `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` (for alkylation)\n*   `SO3/H2SO4` (for blocking)\n*   `dilute H2SO4` (for deblocking)\n*   `HNO3/H2SO4` (needed **twice** for the two nitrations)\n*   `Fe/HCl` (for reduction)\n*   `NaNO2/HCl` (for diazotization)\n*   `H3O+, H2O/Heat` (for hydrolysis)\n*   `NaOH/EtBr` (for etherification)\n\nNow let's examine the reagents provided in each option from the prompt:\n*   **Option A:** Contains: `HNO3/H2SO4` (x2), `Fe/HCl`, `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`, `NaNO2/HCl`, `SO3/H2SO4`, `dilute H2SO4`, `H3O+, H2O/Heat`, `NaOH/EtBr`. **This option contains the complete and correct toolkit.**\n*   **Option B:** Appears to be missing the second `HNO3/H2SO4` reagent.\n*   **Option C:** Appears to be missing the second `HNO3/H2SO4` reagent.\n*   **Option D:** Is missing the crucial sulfonation/desulfonation reagents (`SO3/H2SO4` and `dilute H2SO4`).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAlthough the reaction sequence listed in Option A is out of order, it is the only option that provides the complete set of reagents required to carry out the complex, but chemically sound and high-yield, synthesis of the target molecule. The other options are missing essential reagents for any viable high-yield route.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThis problem asks for the optimal high-yield synthetic sequence to produce a specific trisubstituted benzene derivative. To solve this, we must perform a detailed analysis of the target molecule, the reagents provided, and the chemical logic of each proposed pathway.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule\n*   **Name:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent substituents (a 1,2,3- or vicinal pattern).\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt), a strong *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   Position 2: Tert-butyl group (-tBu), a bulky *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2), a strong *meta*-director.\n*   **Key Challenge:** The \"high-yield\" constraint is critical. Creating a crowded 1,2,3-isomer in high yield is synthetically difficult. Direct substitution sequences often result in mixtures of isomers, violating this constraint.\n\n### 2. Evaluation of the Proposed Synthetic Routes\n\nLet's evaluate the primary strategies presented in the candidate answers by tracing the major products at each step, which is essential for a \"high-yield\" synthesis.\n\n*   **Strategy starting with Nitration (Option D in prompt):** The sequence begins `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`. Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) complexes with the basic amine group, deactivating the ring. This is not a viable route.\n\n*   **Strategy using a \"Blocking Group\" (Starting steps of Option A in prompt):** The sequence `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...` is a standard blocking group strategy.\n    1.  **Alkylation:** Benzene → tert-Butylbenzene.\n    2.  **Sulfonation:** → 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (the sulfonic acid group blocks the favored para position).\n    3.  **Nitration:** The nitration product is `2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid`.\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** In this key intermediate, the t-butyl and nitro groups are *meta* to each other. The target molecule requires them to be *ortho*. Therefore, this otherwise excellent high-yield strategy produces the wrong isomeric backbone and cannot lead to the final product.\n\n*   **The \"Double Nitration\" Strategy (Path detailed by Agent 9, using the reagents in Option C):** This advanced pathway is plausible on paper but extremely complex and relies on selective reductions that may not be high-yield in practice. More importantly, it is not described by any of the listed sequences in their correct order.\n\n### 3. The Most Plausible Route and the \"Typo Hypothesis\"\n\nLet's analyze the sequence presented in **Option A** as interpreted by several agents (and matching Option B/C in the prompt itself), as it represents the most sound chemical logic.\n*   **Sequence:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr`.\n\nLet's trace this path assuming \"high-yield\" means we always use the major product of each reaction:\n1.  **i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`:** → **tert-Butylbenzene**. (High-yield)\n2.  **ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`:** Nitration heavily favors the para position due to sterics. → **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene**. (High-yield major product)\n3.  **iii) `Fe/HCl`:** Reduction of the nitro group. → **4-tert-butylaniline**. (High-yield)\n4.  **iv) `HNO3/H2SO4`:** Second nitration. On the anilinium ion, both the meta-directing `-NH3+` at C1 and the ortho,para-directing `-tBu` at C4 are cooperative, strongly directing the incoming nitro group to the C2 position. → **4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline**. (High-yield and regioselective)\n5.  **v) `NaNO2/HCl`:** Diazotization of the amine. → **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenediazonium salt**. (Standard, efficient)\n6.  **vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`:** Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol. → **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol**. (Standard, efficient)\n7.  **vii) `NaOH/EtBr`:** Williamson ether synthesis. → **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**. (Standard, efficient)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis analysis reveals a critical point: The sequence detailed in **Option A** represents a chemically sound, multi-step, high-yield synthesis. However, it produces **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**, a 1,2,4-isomer, not the named 1,2,3-isomer.\n\nAll other proposed sequences are fatally flawed; they either contain chemically impossible steps or use a valid strategy that definitively leads to the wrong isomeric backbone. The only remaining logical conclusion is that the question contains a typo in the name of the target molecule. The sequence in Option A is the only one that represents a coherent, high-yield synthesis and is almost certainly the intended answer. The extra steps (viii, ix) listed are superfluous distractors.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the best choice among the provided options.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Target Molecule**\n\nThe goal is to perform a high-yield synthesis of **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Substituents:** Ethoxy (-OEt) at C1, tert-Butyl (-tBu) at C2, Nitro (-NO2) at C3.\n*   **Pattern:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted (vicinal) arrangement on the benzene ring.\n*   **Key Structural Features & Challenges:**\n    *   The t-butyl and nitro groups are *ortho* to each other.\n    *   The ethoxy and nitro groups are *meta* to each other.\n    *   This arrangement is sterically crowded.\n    *   The requirement for a \"high-yield\" synthesis is a critical constraint. Pathways that rely on separating a minor isomer from a major one are not considered high-yield.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Options based on their Core Strategy and Chemical Plausibility**\n\nLet's examine the chemical logic of each reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Option D:**\n    *   Starts with nitration (`i) HNO3/H2SO4`), then reduction to aniline (`ii) Fe/HCl`).\n    *   Step `iii)` attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation (`tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`) on aniline. This reaction fails or gives very poor yields because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) complexes with the basic amino group, strongly deactivating the ring.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This pathway is not viable for a high-yield synthesis. Option D is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:**\n    *   Starts with `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` and then `ii) SO3/H2SO4`. This is the start of a \"blocking group\" strategy.\n    *   This correctly forms 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid, blocking the para position.\n    *   Step `iii) HNO3/H2SO4` performs nitration. On this intermediate, both the t-butyl group and the sulfonic acid group direct the incoming nitro group to the same position, yielding **2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    *   **Critical Flaw:** In this intermediate, the t-butyl group and the nitro group are *meta* (1,3 relationship) to each other. The target molecule requires them to be *ortho* (1,2 relationship). This entire strategy, while high-yield, leads to the wrong isomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option B is incorrect as it cannot produce the target molecule.\n\n*   **Option C:**\n    *   The reaction sequence as written is chemically nonsensical.\n    *   Step `iv) NaNO2/HCl` is for diazotization, which requires an amino group (-NH2). The intermediates from the first three steps do not have an amino group. An amino group is not formed until much later (`viii) Fe/HCl`).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The sequence in Option C is impossible. It is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option A:**\n    *   Let's trace the sequence step-by-step:\n        1.  **i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` on Benzene:** Forms **tert-butylbenzene**. (Correct).\n        2.  **ii) `HNO3/H2SO4` on tert-butylbenzene:** This is a standard nitration. Due to the bulkiness of the t-butyl group, this step produces mainly the para isomer (~80%) and only a small amount of the desired ortho isomer (~15%). *This step is a weak point for the \"high-yield\" claim, but it is chemically possible to proceed by isolating the minor ortho product.*\n        3.  **iii) `Fe/HCl` on 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene:** Reduces the nitro group to an amine, forming **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Correct).\n        4.  **iv) `HNO3/H2SO4` on 2-tert-butylaniline:** This is the key regiochemical step. Under the strong acidic conditions of nitration, the amino group is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+). The -NH3+ group at C1 is a *meta*-director, guiding the incoming nitro group to C3. The -tBu group at C2 is an *o,p*-director, which also directs to C3. The directing effects are **cooperative**, favoring the formation of **3-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline** and thus establishing the required 1,2,3 pattern. (Correct and regioselective).\n        5.  **v) `NaNO2/HCl`:** Converts the amino group to a diazonium salt. (Correct).\n        6.  **vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`:** Hydrolyzes the diazonium salt to a phenol. (Correct).\n        7.  **vii) `NaOH/EtBr`:** Converts the phenol to an ethoxy group via Williamson ether synthesis. (Correct).\n        8.  **viii) and ix):** These are superfluous steps at the end and can be ignored.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nWhile the initial nitration step (ii) in Option A is not high-yield for the required ortho-isomer, it is the only pathway presented that is chemically plausible and leads to the correct target molecule. The other options are fundamentally flawed because they either rely on failed reactions (Option D), lead definitively to the wrong isomer (Option B), or contain an impossible sequence of reactions (Option C).\n\nIn a multiple-choice context, the most likely answer is the one that presents a chemically possible route to the target, even if one step has a known yield issue. The question may be flawed in its \"high-yield\" assertion, but Option A is the only viable synthetic pathway among the choices.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the points from the provided candidate answers to arrive at the most logical conclusion.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule and the Core Problem\n\n*   **Target Molecule**: 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Structure**: This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring. The key challenge is that the substituents are all adjacent (vicinal), which is a sterically crowded and synthetically difficult pattern to achieve.\n*   **Key Constraint**: The question requires a **\"high-yield\"** synthesis. This means each step should be efficient and highly regioselective, avoiding the need to separate a minor product from a mixture of isomers.\n\n### 2. Evaluate the Plausibility of the Main Synthetic Strategies\n\nThere are three primary strategies presented across the candidate answers. Let's critically evaluate each one.\n\n*   **Strategy 1: The High-Yield Path to an Isomer.**\n    *   **Sequence:** Alkylation -> para-Nitration -> Reduction -> ortho-Nitration -> Diazotization/Hydrolysis -> Etherification.\n    *   **Analysis:** This pathway (analyzed by Agents 1, 8, 10) is chemically sound, and each step is high-yield because it utilizes the major product of each reaction (e.g., para-nitration of tert-butylbenzene).\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This route definitively produces **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**, which is a 1,2,4-isomer, not the required 1,2,3-isomer. This strategy is only correct if there is a typo in the question's target molecule name.\n\n*   **Strategy 2: The Blocking Group Path.**\n    *   **Sequence:** Alkylation -> para-Sulfonation (blocking) -> ortho-Nitration...\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a classic, powerful, and high-yield strategy for controlling substitution (analyzed by Agents 2, 4, 11, 12, 14).\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** After the initial steps, the key intermediate is `4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`. In this molecule, the tert-butyl and nitro groups are **meta** to each other. The target molecule requires them to be **ortho**. Therefore, this high-yield strategy cannot lead to the correct product.\n\n*   **Strategy 3: The Low-Yield Path to the Correct Product.**\n    *   **Sequence:** Alkylation -> ortho-Nitration -> Reduction -> Nitration -> Diazotization/Hydrolysis -> Etherification.\n    *   **Analysis:** This pathway (analyzed brilliantly by Agents 3, 6, 13, and 14) is the only one that can chemically lead to the correct 1,2,3-isomer.\n        1.  **Alkylation:** Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene.\n        2.  **Nitration:** This produces a mixture of ortho- and para-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. To proceed, one must isolate the **minor ortho-isomer**. This step violates the \"high-yield\" constraint but is chemically necessary.\n        3.  **Reduction:** `Fe/HCl` converts the nitro group to an amino group, forming 2-tert-butylaniline.\n        4.  **Second Nitration:** This is the key step. On 2-tert-butylaniline, the amine group protonates in acid to `-NH3+` (a meta-director) and the tert-butyl group is an ortho,para-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position C3, establishing the correct 1,2,3-pattern.\n        5.  **Conversion:** The amino group is converted to the final ethoxy group via diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`), hydrolysis (`H3O+/Heat`), and Williamson ether synthesis (`NaOH/EtBr`).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is the only sequence that leads to the named product. Its only flaw is the violation of the \"high-yield\" constraint in step 2.\n\n### 3. Final Decision\n\nWe must choose the best option among flawed alternatives.\n*   Strategies 1 and 2 are incorrect because they definitively lead to the wrong product isomer, regardless of yield.\n*   Strategy 3 leads to the correct product but has one low-yield step.\n\nIn a chemical synthesis problem, a pathway that is chemically *possible* (even if inefficient) is superior to a pathway that is chemically *impossible* or leads to the wrong destination entirely. The other proposed options contain steps that are nonsensical (e.g., diazotizing without an amine), based on failed reactions (e.g., Friedel-Crafts on an aniline), or lead to the wrong isomer.\n\nTherefore, the sequence outlined in **Strategy 3** is the only logical choice. Option **A** presents the correct sequence of reaction types for this strategy.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
