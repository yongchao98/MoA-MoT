    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Initial State:**\n    The particle is a spin-1/2 particle, and its magnetic moment `μ = γS` is aligned with a magnetic field `B` in the +Z direction. The Hamiltonian for this initial situation is `H_initial = -μ ⋅ B = -γS_z B`. Since the moment is aligned with the field, the particle is in the lowest energy state, which is an eigenstate of the `S_z` operator. For a spin-1/2 particle, this is the \"spin-up\" state with respect to the Z-axis. We denote this state as `|+z>`. So, the state of the system at time t=0 is `|ψ(t=0)> = |+z>`. In the standard basis where `S_z` is diagonal, this state is represented by the vector `[1, 0]^T`.\n\n2.  **New Hamiltonian:**\n    At t=0, the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction with the same magnitude `B`. The new Hamiltonian for `t > 0` is `H = -μ ⋅ B = -γ(S_x B_x + S_y B_y + S_z B_z)`. Since the new field is `B` in the +Y direction, this becomes `H = -γB S_y`.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution of the State:**\n    The state of the particle will evolve according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation governed by the new Hamiltonian `H`. The solution is given by:\n    `|ψ(t)> = U(t)|ψ(0)> = exp(-iHt/ħ)|ψ(0)>`\n    Substituting the expression for `H`:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i(-γB S_y)t/ħ)|+z> = exp(iγBtS_y/ħ)|+z>`\n    Let's define the Larmor frequency `ω = γB`. The equation becomes:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(iωtS_y/ħ)|+z>`\n    For a spin-1/2 particle, the spin operator `S_y` can be written in terms of the Pauli Y-matrix `σ_y`: `S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y`.\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(iωt(ħ/2)σ_y/ħ)|+z> = exp(i(ωt/2)σ_y)|+z>`\n\n    We can expand the exponential operator using the property `(σ_y)^2 = I` (where I is the identity matrix):\n    `exp(iθσ_y) = I cos(θ) + iσ_y sin(θ)`\n    Here, `θ = ωt/2`. The matrix for `σ_y` in the `S_z` basis is `[[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n    So the time evolution operator `U(t)` is:\n    `U(t) = [[cos(ωt/2), 0], [0, cos(ωt/2)]] + i sin(ωt/2) [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n    `U(t) = [[cos(ωt/2), sin(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2), cos(ωt/2)]]`\n\n    Now, we apply this operator to the initial state `|+z> = [1, 0]^T`:\n    `|ψ(t)> = [[cos(ωt/2), sin(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2), cos(ωt/2)]] [1, 0]^T = [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)]^T`\n    In bra-ket notation: `|ψ(t)> = cos(ωt/2)|+z> - sin(ωt/2)|-z>`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value of the Z-Component of the Magnetic Moment:**\n    We need to find the average (expectation value) of `μ_z`, which is `<μ_z(t)>`.\n    `<μ_z(t)> = <ψ(t)|μ_z|ψ(t)> = <ψ(t)|γS_z|ψ(t)> = γ<S_z(t)>`\n    Let's calculate `<S_z(t)>`:\n    `<S_z(t)> = <ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)>`\n    We know that `S_z|+z> = +(ħ/2)|+z>` and `S_z|-z> = -(ħ/2)|-z>`.\n    `S_z|ψ(t)> = S_z(cos(ωt/2)|+z> - sin(ωt/2)|-z>)`\n    `= cos(ωt/2)(ħ/2)|+z> - sin(ωt/2)(-ħ/2)|-z>`\n    `= (ħ/2)[cos(ωt/2)|+z> + sin(ωt/2)|-z>]`\n    Now we take the inner product with `<ψ(t)| = cos(ωt/2)<+z| - sin(ωt/2)<-z|`:\n    `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2)(cos(ωt/2)<+z| - sin(ωt/2)<-z|)(cos(ωt/2)|+z> + sin(ωt/2)|-z>)`\n    Using the orthogonality of the states (`<+z|+z>=1`, `<+z|-z>=0`, etc.), we get:\n    `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2)[cos²(ωt/2) - sin²(ωt/2)]`\n    Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`:\n    `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2)cos(ωt)`\n\n5.  **Determine the Oscillation Frequency:**\n    The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n    `<μ_z(t)> = γ<S_z(t)> = γ(ħ/2)cos(ωt)`\n    Substituting back `ω = γB`:\n    `<μ_z(t)> = (γħ/2)cos((γB)t)`\n    This expression describes a sinusoidal oscillation. The term inside the cosine function is `(Angular Frequency) * time`. Therefore, the angular frequency of oscillation is `Ω = γB`.\n\nThe options provided are in the format of angular frequency.\n\n**Alternative approach (Classical/Semi-classical picture):**\nThe magnetic field `B` exerts a torque `τ` on the magnetic moment `μ`: `τ = μ x B`.\nThe torque causes a change in the angular momentum `S`: `dS/dt = τ`.\nCombining these, we get the equation of motion for the spin vector: `dS/dt = γS x B`.\nThis equation describes the precession of the spin vector `S` around the magnetic field vector `B`. The frequency of this precession is the Larmor frequency, `ω_L = γB`.\nInitially, the spin is along the +Z axis. The new field is along the +Y axis. The spin vector will start precessing in the X-Z plane around the Y-axis. The Z-component of the spin vector, `<S_z>`, will oscillate between `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2` with the Larmor frequency. The frequency of this oscillation is `ω = γB`.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
