    "This problem asks for the scalar and vector potentials for a moving point charge, which are known as the Liénard–Wiechert potentials.\n\n1.  **Starting Point: Retarded Potentials**\n\nThe general solutions for the scalar potential V and vector potential **A** for time-dependent charge and current distributions are the retarded potentials:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3\\vec{r}'$\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3\\vec{r}'$\n\nwhere:\n*   $\\vec{r}$ is the observation point (field point).\n*   $\\vec{r}'$ is the source point.\n*   $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)$ is the charge density at the source point at the retarded time $t_r$.\n*   $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)$ is the current density at the source point at the retarded time $t_r$.\n*   The retarded time $t_r$ is defined by $t_r = t - \\dfrac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}$, which is the time at which the signal (electromagnetic field) had to be emitted from $\\vec{r}'$ to reach $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$.\n\n2.  **Applying to a Moving Point Charge**\n\nFor a point charge q, the charge and current densities are given by:\n*   $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n*   $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q\\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\nwhere $\\vec{s}(t')$ is the position of the charge at time $t'$, and $\\vec{v}(t') = d\\vec{s}/dt'$ is its velocity.\n\nSubstituting these into the potential integrals seems straightforward, but there is a complication: the delta function contains the time $t'$, but the integrand needs to be evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$. The relation $t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|/c$ makes the integration non-trivial.\n\nA standard result from electrodynamics shows that when evaluating the integral over the delta function, one must account for the change in volume due to the retardation effect. The integral evaluates to:\n\n$\\int \\dfrac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3\\vec{r}' = \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nwhere:\n*   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the vector from the charge's position at the retarded time $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$.\n*   $d = |\\vec{d}|$.\n*   $\\hat{d} = \\vec{d}/d$ is the unit vector in the direction of $\\vec{d}$.\n*   $\\vec{v}$ is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$.\n*   The entire expression in the square brackets is evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n3.  **Deriving the Potentials**\n\nUsing this result, we can write down the potentials.\n\n**Scalar Potential (V):**\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - d(\\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nSince $\\hat{d} = \\vec{d}/d$, we have $d\\hat{d} = \\vec{d}$. So, the denominator becomes:\n\n$d - \\dfrac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\nTherefore, the scalar potential is:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}/c}$\n\nTo match the format of the options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by c:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{c(d - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}/c)} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})}$\n\n**Vector Potential (A):**\n\nSimilarly, the integral for the vector potential gives:\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d(1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}/c}$\n\nAgain, to match the options, multiply the numerator and denominator by c:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{c(d - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}/c)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})}$\n\n4.  **Comparing with the Options**\n\nLet's check our derived expressions against the given choices:\n*   Derived V: $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})}$\n*   Derived A: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})}$\n\nThese expressions perfectly match the ones given in option C.\n\n*   **Option A** is incorrect as it uses the static potential form.\n*   **Option B** is incorrect due to the plus sign in the denominator. The Doppler-like effect described by the denominator depends on the component of velocity along the line of sight; a charge moving away should result in a weaker potential, and a charge moving toward should result in a stronger potential. The minus sign `(dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})` correctly captures this.\n*   **Option D** is incorrect as it uses the static potential form for V.\n\nTherefore, the correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are given in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
