    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the uncertainty in the measurement of the observable $P_z$, which is denoted by $\\Delta P_z$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Uncertainty:** The uncertainty of an operator $A$ in a given state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is defined by the standard deviation:\n    $(\\Delta A)^2 = \\langle A^2 \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle^2$\n    Therefore, for our operator $P_z$, the formula is:\n    $(\\Delta P_z)^2 = \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2$\n    where $\\langle P_z \\rangle$ is the expectation value of $P_z$ and $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$ is the expectation value of $P_z^2$.\n\n3.  **Define the Given Matrices and State Vector:**\n    The matrix for the operator $P_z$ is given as:\n    $P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    The state of the system is given by the column vector (ket state):\n    $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    The corresponding bra state (the conjugate transpose of the ket) is:\n    $\\langle\\psi| = (|\\psi\\rangle)^\\dagger = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value $\\langle P_z \\rangle$:**\n    The expectation value is calculated as $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|P_z|\\psi\\rangle$.\n    First, let's calculate the action of $P_z$ on the state $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n    $P_z |\\psi\\rangle = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\cdot (-1/2) + 0 + 0 \\\\ 0 + 0 + 0 \\\\ 0 + 0 + (-1) \\cdot (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    Now, multiply by the bra state $\\langle\\psi|$ from the left:\n    $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle\\psi| (P_z|\\psi\\rangle) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n    $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\hbar \\left[ (-1/2)(-1/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(1/2) \\right]$\n    $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\hbar \\left[ 1/4 + 0 - 1/4 \\right] = 0$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Expectation Value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$:**\n    First, we need the matrix for the operator $P_z^2$.\n    $P_z^2 = P_z \\cdot P_z = \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n    $P_z^2 = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1\\cdot1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0\\cdot0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & (-1)\\cdot(-1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    Now we calculate the expectation value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|P_z^2|\\psi\\rangle$:\n    $P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle\\psi| (P_z^2|\\psi\\rangle) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n    $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\left[ (-1/2)(-1/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(-1/2) \\right]$\n    $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\left[ 1/4 + 0 + 1/4 \\right] = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$:**\n    Now substitute the calculated expectation values back into the uncertainty formula:\n    $(\\Delta P_z)^2 = \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - (0)^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$\n    $\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\nThe uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$ is $\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nI will use Python to confirm the calculations.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define constants and state vector\n# We can set hbar = 1 for the calculation and add it back at the end.\nhbar = 1\npsi = np.array([[-1/2], [1/np.sqrt(2)], [-1/2]])\npsi_dagger = psi.conj().T\n\n# Define the operator P_z\nPz = hbar * np.array([\n    [1, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, -1]\n])\n\n# Calculate the expectation value of P_z\nexp_Pz = (psi_dagger @ Pz @ psi)[0, 0]\n\n# Calculate the operator P_z^2\nPz_squared = Pz @ Pz\n\n# Calculate the expectation value of P_z^2\nexp_Pz_squared = (psi_dagger @ Pz_squared @ psi)[0, 0]\n\n# Calculate the variance (uncertainty squared)\nvariance_Pz = exp_Pz_squared - (exp_Pz)**2\n\n# Calculate the uncertainty (standard deviation)\nuncertainty_Pz = np.sqrt(variance_Pz)\n\n# The result is in units of hbar.
