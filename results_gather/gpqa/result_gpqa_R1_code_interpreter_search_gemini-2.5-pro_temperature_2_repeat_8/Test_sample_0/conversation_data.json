    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Principle:** The problem relates to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time. This principle states that for a quantum state, the uncertainty in its energy ($\\Delta E$) and its lifetime ($\\Delta t$) are inversely related. A shorter lifetime leads to a larger uncertainty or \"spread\" in its energy level. The mathematical relationship is:\n    \n    $\\Delta E \\cdot \\Delta t \\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$\n    \n    where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant. For calculation purposes, we can use the approximation:\n    \n    $\\Delta E \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Delta t}$\n    \n    Here, $\\Delta t$ is the lifetime of the state ($\\tau$), and $\\Delta E$ is the natural linewidth or energy width of the state.\n\n2.  **Define the Resolution Condition:** To \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the difference between their energies ($|E_1 - E_2|$) must be larger than their combined energy widths. A common criterion for clear resolution is that the energy separation must be greater than the sum of their individual energy widths ($\\Delta E_1 + \\Delta E_2$).\n    \n    So, the condition is: $|E_1 - E_2| > \\Delta E_1 + \\Delta E_2$\n\n3.  **Identify Given Values:**\n    *   Lifetime of state 1, $\\tau_1 = 10^{-9}$ s.\n    *   Lifetime of state 2, $\\tau_2 = 10^{-8}$ s.\n\n4.  **Find the Necessary Constant:** We need the value of the reduced Planck constant ($\\hbar$) in units of electron-volt-seconds (eV·s) to get the energy in eV.\n    *   $\\hbar \\approx 6.582 \\times 10^{-16}$ eV·s.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Energy Width for Each State:**\n    *   For state 1:\n        $\\Delta E_1 \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{\\tau_1} = \\frac{6.582 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ eV·s}}{10^{-9} \\text{ s}} = 6.582 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV\n    *   For state 2:\n        $\\Delta E_2 \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{\\tau_2} = \\frac{6.582 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ eV·s}}{10^{-8} \\text{ s}} = 6.582 \\times 10^{-8}$ eV\n\n6.  **Calculate the Minimum Required Energy Separation:**\n    *   The minimum energy separation required for resolution is the sum of the individual widths:\n        $\\Delta E_{required} \\approx \\Delta E_1 + \\Delta E_2$\n        $\\Delta E_{required} \\approx (6.582 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ eV}) + (6.582 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ eV})$\n        $\\Delta E_{required} \\approx (6.582 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ eV}) + (0.6582 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ eV})$\n        $\\Delta E_{required} \\approx 7.24 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV\n\n7.  **Compare with the Given Options:** We need to find the option that is greater than the calculated required separation of approximately $7.24 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV.\n    *   A) $10^{-11}$ eV (much smaller)\n    *   B) $10^{-4}$ eV (much larger)\n    *   C) $10^{-8}$ eV (smaller)\n    *   D) $10^{-9}$ eV (much smaller)\n\n    Only option B, $10^{-4}$ eV, is greater than the minimum required energy difference.\n\nTo verify the calculation, we can use a Python script.\n\n```python\n# Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nhbar_eVs = 6.582119569e-16\n\n# Lifetimes in seconds\ntau1 = 1e-9\ntau2 = 1e-8\n\n# Calculate the approximate energy width (linewidth) for each state\n# delta_E is approximately hbar / tau\ndelta_E1 = hbar_eVs / tau1\ndelta_E2 = hbar_eVs / tau2\n\n# For the energy levels to be resolvable, their energy difference must be\n# greater than the sum of their individual widths.\nrequired_energy_difference = delta_E1 + delta_E2\n\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 1: {delta_E1:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 2: {delta_E2:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Required energy difference for resolution (sum of widths): {required_energy_difference:.3e} eV\")\n\n# Check which option is larger than the required difference\noptions = {\n    \"A\": 1e-11,\n    \"B\": 1e-4,\n    \"C\": 1e-8,\n    \"D\": 1e-9\n}\n\nprint(\"\\nComparing options to the required difference:\")\nfor option, value in options.items():\n    if value > required_energy_difference:\n        print(f\"Option {option} ({value:.1e} eV) is a possible energy difference because it is > {required_energy_difference:.3e} eV.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Option {option} ({value:.1e} eV) is NOT a possible energy difference because it is <= {required_energy_difference:.3e} eV.\")\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This question is about the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle as it relates to energy and time.\n\n**1. The Uncertainty Principle**\n\nThe principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle can be known simultaneously. For energy ($E$) and time ($t$), this relationship is:\n\n$\\Delta E \\cdot \\Delta t \\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$\n\nwhere:\n*   $\\Delta E$ is the uncertainty in energy.\n*   $\\Delta t$ is the uncertainty in time (in this case, the lifetime of the quantum state, $\\tau$).\n*   $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, approximately $6.582 \\times 10^{-16}$ eV·s.\n\nFor a state with a finite lifetime $\\tau$, its energy is not perfectly sharp but has a \"width\" or uncertainty $\\Delta E$. We can approximate this energy width as:\n\n$\\Delta E \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{\\tau}$\n\n**2. The Condition for Resolution**\n\nTo be able to \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the difference in their energies, $|E_1 - E_2|$, must be greater than the sum of their individual energy widths, $\\Delta E_1 + \\Delta E_2$.\n\nCondition: $|E_1 - E_2| > \\Delta E_1 + \\Delta E_2$\n\n**3. Calculation**\n\n*   **Given lifetimes:**\n    *   $\\tau_1 = 10^{-9}$ s\n    *   $\\tau_2 = 10^{-8}$ s\n\n*   **Calculate the energy width for each state:**\n    *   $\\Delta E_1 \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{\\tau_1} = \\frac{6.582 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ eV·s}}{10^{-9} \\text{ s}} = 6.582 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV\n    *   $\\Delta E_2 \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{\\tau_2} = \\frac{6.582 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ eV·s}}{10^{-8} \\text{ s}} = 6.582 \\times 10^{-8}$ eV\n\n*   **Calculate the minimum required energy difference for resolution:**\n    *   Sum of widths = $\\Delta E_1 + \\Delta E_2$\n    *   Sum of widths $\\approx (6.582 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ eV}) + (6.582 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ eV})$\n    *   Sum of widths $\\approx (6.582 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ eV}) + (0.6582 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ eV}) \\approx 7.24 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe energy difference between the two states must be greater than approximately $7.24 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV. Let's compare this with the given options:\n\n*   A) $10^{-11}$ eV (Not greater than $7.24 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV)\n*   B) $10^{-4}$ eV (Greater than $7.24 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV)\n*   C) $10^{-8}$ eV (Not greater than $7.24 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV)\n*   D) $10^{-9}$ eV (Not greater than $7.24 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV)\n\nOnly option B provides an energy difference large enough to clearly resolve the two states.\n\n<<<B>>>"
