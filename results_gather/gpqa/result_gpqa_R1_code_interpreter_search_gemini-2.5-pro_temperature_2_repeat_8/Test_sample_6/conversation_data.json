    "This problem requires us to find the threshold energy for a high-energy gamma-ray ($\\gamma$) to produce an electron-positron ($e^+e^-$) pair upon collision with a Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photon ($\\gamma_{CMB}$). The reaction is:\n$\\gamma + \\gamma_{CMB} \\rightarrow e^{+} + e^{-}$\n\nTo solve this, we will use the principles of special relativity, specifically the conservation of four-momentum.\n\n1.  **Four-Momentum Conservation:**\n    Let the four-momenta of the particles be:\n    *   $p_{\\gamma}$: for the high-energy gamma-ray, with energy $E_{\\gamma}$ and momentum $|\\vec{p}_{\\gamma}| = E_{\\gamma}/c$.\n    *   $p_{CMB}$: for the CMB photon, with energy $E_{CMB}$ and momentum $|\\vec{p}_{CMB}| = E_{CMB}/c$.\n    *   $p_{e^+}$: for the positron.\n    *   $p_{e^-}$: for the electron.\n\n    The conservation of four-momentum states:\n    $p_{\\gamma} + p_{CMB} = p_{e^+} + p_{e^-}$\n\n2.  **Invariant Mass:**\n    The square of the four-momentum of a particle is a Lorentz invariant quantity, equal to $(mc^2)^2$. We can square both sides of the conservation equation to work with invariants:\n    $(p_{\\gamma} + p_{CMB})^2 = (p_{e^+} + p_{e^-})^2$\n\n    Let's expand the left side:\n    $(p_{\\gamma} + p_{CMB})^2 = p_{\\gamma}^2 + p_{CMB}^2 + 2 p_{\\gamma} \\cdot p_{CMB}$\n    Since photons are massless, their four-momentum squared is zero ($p_{\\gamma}^2 = 0$ and $p_{CMB}^2 = 0$).\n    So, the left side simplifies to $2 p_{\\gamma} \\cdot p_{CMB}$.\n\n    The dot product of the two photon four-momenta is:\n    $p_{\\gamma} \\cdot p_{CMB} = E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB} - \\vec{p}_{\\gamma} \\cdot \\vec{p}_{CMB} = E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB} - |\\vec{p}_{\\gamma}||\\vec{p}_{CMB}|\\cos\\theta$\n    where $\\theta$ is the angle between the directions of the two photons. Since $|\\vec{p}| = E/c$ for photons, this becomes:\n    $p_{\\gamma} \\cdot p_{CMB} = E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n\n    So, the left side of our invariant equation is $2 E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}(1 - \\cos\\theta)$.\n\n3.  **Threshold Condition:**\n    The threshold energy is the minimum energy required for the reaction to occur. At this minimum energy, the electron and positron are created with no kinetic energy in their center-of-mass frame; they are essentially created at rest.\n    The total energy in the center-of-mass frame is the sum of the rest energies of the electron and positron, which is $m_e c^2 + m_e c^2 = 2m_e c^2$. The total momentum is zero.\n    The square of the total four-momentum of the $e^+e^-$ system, which is a Lorentz invariant, is therefore $(2m_e c^2)^2 = 4(m_e c^2)^2$.\n\n4.  **Deriving the Threshold Energy:**\n    Equating the invariant quantities from both sides:\n    $2 E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}(1 - \\cos\\theta) = 4(m_e c^2)^2$\n    $E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{2(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}(1 - \\cos\\theta)}$\n\n    To find the minimum or threshold energy for $E_{\\gamma}$, the denominator must be maximized. This occurs when the collision is head-on, meaning the photons travel towards each other. In this case, the angle $\\theta = \\pi$ radians (or 180Â°), and $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$.\n    The term $(1 - \\cos\\theta)$ becomes $(1 - (-1)) = 2$.\n\n    Substituting this into the equation gives the threshold energy, $E_{\\gamma, th}$:\n    $E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{2(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}(2)} = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$\n\n5.  **Calculation:**\n    Now we plug in the given and known values:\n    *   Average CMB photon energy, $E_{CMB} = 10^{-3}$ eV.\n    *   Electron rest mass energy, $m_e c^2 \\approx 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6$ eV.\n\n    $E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n    $E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n    $E_{\\gamma, th} = 0.261121 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV} = 2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}$\n\n    The options are in GeV ($1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$). Let's convert our result:\n    $E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}} = 2.61121 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThis value is approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5$ GeV. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 2.6 * 1e5 GeV\nB) 9.5 * 1e4 GeV\nC) 3.9 * 1e5 GeV\nD) 1.8 * 1e5 GeV\n\nOur calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
