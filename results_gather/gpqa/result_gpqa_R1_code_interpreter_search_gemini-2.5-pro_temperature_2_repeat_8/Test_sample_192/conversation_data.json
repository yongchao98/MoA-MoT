    "The user wants to find the relationship between the number of stars per unit distance and the distance `r`.\n\n1.  **Analyze the given information:**\n    The number of stars, let's call it `N`, is a function of parallax, `plx`.\n    The given relationship is `N ∝ 1/plx^5`. This means `N = k₁ * (1/plx^5)` for some constant `k₁`.\n    Note that `N` here represents the cumulative number of stars with parallax *greater than or equal to* `plx`. A larger parallax means a closer star, so this is the number of stars out to a certain distance.\n\n2.  **Relate parallax and distance:**\n    Parallax (`plx`) and distance (`r`) are inversely related.\n    The relationship is `plx = 1/r`.\n\n3.  **Express the number of stars as a function of distance:**\n    Substitute `plx = 1/r` into the given relationship for `N`.\n    `N ∝ 1 / (1/r)^5`\n    `N ∝ 1 / (1/r^5)`\n    `N ∝ r^5`\n    So, the total number of stars (`N`) out to a distance `r` is proportional to `r^5`. Let's write this as `N(r) = k₂ * r^5`, where `k₂` is another constant of proportionality.\n\n4.  **Find the number of stars per unit range of distance:**\n    The question asks how the number of stars \"change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)\". This is asking for the number density of stars with respect to distance, which is the derivative of the cumulative number `N(r)` with respect to `r`, i.e., `dN/dr`.\n    We need to differentiate `N(r)` with respect to `r`.\n    `N(r) = k₂ * r^5`\n    `dN/dr = d/dr (k₂ * r^5)`\n    Using the power rule for differentiation `d/dx(x^n) = n*x^(n-1)`:\n    `dN/dr = k₂ * 5 * r^(5-1)`\n    `dN/dr = 5k₂ * r^4`\n\n5.  **Determine the proportionality:**\n    From the result `dN/dr = 5k₂ * r^4`, we can see that the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to `r^4`.\n    `dN/dr ∝ r^4`\n\n6.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    A) ~ r^3\n    B) ~ r^2\n    C) ~ r^5\n    D) ~ r^4\n\n    The calculated relationship `~ r^4` matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
