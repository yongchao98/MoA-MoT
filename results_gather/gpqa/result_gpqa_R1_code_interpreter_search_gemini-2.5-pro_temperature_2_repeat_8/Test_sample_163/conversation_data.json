    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the total mass of system_1 to the total mass of system_2. The total mass of a system is the sum of the masses of its two stars (`M_total = M₁ + M₂`).\n\n2.  **Identify Given Information:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Orbital Period (`P₁`) = 2 years\n        *   Velocity Amplitude of Star 1 (`K₁a`) = 10 km/s\n        *   Velocity Amplitude of Star 2 (`K₁b`) = 5 km/s\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Orbital Period (`P₂`) = 1 year\n        *   Velocity Amplitude of Star 1 (`K₂a`) = 15 km/s\n        *   Velocity Amplitude of Star 2 (`K₂b`) = 10 km/s\n\n3.  **Select the Appropriate Physical Law:** For a double-lined spectroscopic binary system (where we can measure the radial velocities of both stars), the total mass (`M_total`) can be determined from the orbital period (`P`) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities (`K₁` and `K₂`). The formula is derived from Kepler's Third Law:\n    `M₁ + M₂ = (P / (2 * π * G * sin³(i))) * (K₁ + K₂)³`\n    Where:\n    *   `M₁ + M₂` is the total mass of the system.\n    *   `P` is the orbital period.\n    *   `K₁` and `K₂` are the radial velocity semi-amplitudes.\n    *   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n    *   `i` is the inclination of the orbital plane to the line of sight.\n\n4.  **Apply the Eclipsing Binary Assumption:** The problem states that both systems are eclipsing. This is crucial because it means the inclination angle `i` must be close to 90 degrees. When `i ≈ 90°`, `sin(i) ≈ 1`, and therefore `sin³(i) ≈ 1`. We can assume this value is the same for both systems, and any constant terms like `2 * π * G * sin³(i)` will cancel out when we take the ratio of the masses.\n\n5.  **Formulate the Ratio:**\n    Let `M_total₁` be the total mass of system_1 and `M_total₂` be the total mass of system_2. The ratio of their masses is:\n    `(M_total₁ / M_total₂) = [P₁ * (K₁a + K₁b)³] / [P₂ * (K₂a + K₂b)³]`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Sum of Velocities for Each System:**\n    *   For system_1: `K_sum₁ = K₁a + K₁b = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s`\n    *   For system_2: `K_sum₂ = K₂a + K₂b = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s`\n\n7.  **Substitute the Values and Compute the Ratio:**\n    *   `P₁ = 2` years\n    *   `P₂ = 1` year\n    *   `K_sum₁ = 15` km/s\n    *   `K_sum₂ = 25` km/s\n\n    `Ratio = (2 * (15)³) / (1 * (25)³)`\n    `Ratio = (2 * 15 * 15 * 15) / (25 * 25 * 25)`\n    `Ratio = (2 * 3375) / (15625)`\n    `Ratio = 6750 / 15625`\n\n    To simplify the fraction:\n    `Ratio = (54 * 125) / (125 * 125) = 54 / 125`\n    `Ratio = 0.432`\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated ratio is 0.432. This value is closest to 0.4.\n\nI will use a Python script to verify the calculation.\n```python\n# Parameters for System 1\nP1 = 2.0  # years\nK1a = 10.0  # km/s\nK1b = 5.0  # km/s\n\n# Parameters for System 2\nP2 = 1.0  # year\nK2a = 15.0  # km/s\nK2b = 10.0  # km/s\n\n# Calculate the sum of velocity amplitudes for each system\nK_sum_1 = K1a + K1b\nK_sum_2 = K2a + K2b\n\n# The total mass is proportional to P * (K_sum)^3.\n# We calculate the ratio of these proportional terms.\nmass_prop_1 = P1 * (K_sum_1)**3\nmass_prop_2 = P2 * (K_sum_2)**3\n\n# Calculate the final ratio\nratio = mass_prop_1 / mass_prop_2\n\nprint(ratio)\n```\n\nThe calculation is confirmed to be 0.432. This value is approximately 0.4.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The total mass of a spectroscopic binary system can be determined using Kepler's Third Law, adapted for radial velocities. For a double-lined spectroscopic binary, where the velocities of both stars are observed, the sum of the masses (M₁ + M₂) is given by the mass function:\n\nM₁ + M₂ = [P / (2πG * sin³(i))] * (K₁ + K₂)³\n\nWhere:\n*   `P` is the orbital period.\n*   `K₁` and `K₂` are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities of the two stars.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n*   `i` is the inclination of the orbital plane with respect to the line of sight.\n\nThe problem states that both binary systems are eclipsing. This is a critical piece of information because eclipses only occur when the orbital plane is viewed nearly edge-on, meaning the inclination angle `i` is very close to 90°. When `i` ≈ 90°, `sin(i)` ≈ 1, and therefore `sin³(i)` ≈ 1.\n\nWe can set up a ratio of the mass of system 1 (M_sys1) to the mass of system 2 (M_sys2). By doing this, the constant term `1 / (2πG)` cancels out, and since `sin³(i)` is approximately 1 for both systems, it also cancels out.\n\nThe ratio of the masses becomes:\n\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = [P₁ * (K₁ₐ + K₁b)³] / [P₂ * (K₂ₐ + K₂b)³]\n\nNow, let's plug in the given values:\n\n**For system_1:**\n*   P₁ = 2 years\n*   K₁ₐ = 10 km/s\n*   K₁b = 5 km/s\n*   Sum of velocities (K_sum1) = 10 + 5 = 15 km/s\n\n**For system_2:**\n*   P₂ = 1 year\n*   K₂ₐ = 15 km/s\n*   K₂b = 10 km/s\n*   Sum of velocities (K_sum2) = 15 + 10 = 25 km/s\n\nSubstitute these into the ratio equation:\n\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = (2 * 3375) / 15625\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = 6750 / 15625\nM_sys1 / M_sys2 = 0.432\n\nThis value, 0.432, is closest to the option 0.4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
