    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Premise\nThe question describes a hypothetical scenario where the pp-III branch of the Sun's proton-proton chain reaction suddenly stops. All other reactions, including the pp-I, pp-II, and CNO cycle, continue as normal. We are asked for the ratio of neutrino fluxes in two specific energy bands, as measured on Earth. Since the travel time for neutrinos from the Sun is about 8.5 minutes, a stoppage 8.5 minutes ago means the effects are just being observed now.\n\n### 2. Identify Neutrino Sources by Energy\nFirst, we need to identify which solar reactions produce neutrinos in the two specified energy bands. The primary sources of solar neutrinos and their energy characteristics are:\n*   **pp neutrinos:** From `p + p → ²H + e⁺ + νe`. Continuous spectrum with a maximum energy (E_max) of 420 keV.\n*   **pep neutrinos:** From `p + e⁻ + p → ²H + νe`. A sharp, monoenergetic line at 1.44 MeV (1440 keV).\n*   **⁷Be neutrinos:** From `⁷Be + e⁻ → ⁷Li + νe`. This reaction is part of the pp-II branch. It produces two monoenergetic lines: one at 861 keV (which accounts for ~90% of the ⁷Be neutrinos) and a weaker one at 384 keV (~10%).\n*   **⁸B neutrinos:** From `⁸B → ⁸Be + e⁺ + νe`. This reaction **is the pp-III branch**. It produces a continuous spectrum of high-energy neutrinos, up to E_max ≈ 15 MeV.\n*   **CNO neutrinos:** From decays of ¹³N, ¹⁵O, and ¹⁷F in the CNO cycle. These produce continuous spectra with E_max up to about 1.74 MeV.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Effect of Stopping the pp-III Branch\nThe problem states that the pp-III branch stops. This means the reaction `⁸B → ⁸Be + e⁺ + νe` ceases, and therefore the flux of **⁸B neutrinos goes to zero**. All other neutrino sources remain active. Crucially, the production of ⁷Be (which is the input for both pp-II and pp-III) and its decay via the pp-II branch continue, so the production of **⁷Be neutrinos is unaffected**.\n\n### 4. Determine the Flux in Each Energy Band Under the New Scenario\n\n*   **Band 1: 700 keV - 800 keV**\n    *   pp neutrinos are below this range.\n    *   pep neutrinos are above this range.\n    *   ⁷Be neutrino lines are at 384 keV and 861 keV, neither of which is in this band.\n    *   ⁸B neutrinos would normally contribute here, but their flux is now zero.\n    *   Therefore, the only remaining source of neutrinos in this band is from the **CNO cycle**.\n\n*   **Band 2: 800 keV - 900 keV**\n    *   This band contains the very prominent, sharp, monoenergetic **⁷Be neutrino line at 861 keV**.\n    *   ⁸B neutrinos would normally contribute, but their flux is zero.\n    *   This band also receives some flux from the continuous spectrum of **CNO cycle neutrinos**.\n    *   Therefore, the flux in this band comes from the **⁷Be line + CNO cycle neutrinos**.\n\n### 5. Compare the Magnitudes of the Fluxes\nNow we need to compare the flux in Band 1 to the flux in Band 2. Let's look up the standard predicted fluxes for the relevant sources:\n\n*   **Total Flux from the main ⁷Be line (at 861 keV):** ~4.5 x 10⁹ neutrinos / (cm²·s)\n*   **Total Flux from all CNO sources combined:** ~5 x 10⁸ neutrinos / (cm²·s)\n\nLet's calculate the fluxes for our scenario:\n\n*   **Flux (Band 1) = Flux_CNO(700-800 keV)**\n    *   This is the flux from CNO sources within a 100 keV wide window. The total CNO flux is ~5 x 10⁸, which is spread over an energy range of ~1.7 MeV. The flux in this specific narrow band will be only a small fraction of the total CNO flux. A rough estimate might be around 10% of the total, so ~5 x 10⁷.\n\n*   **Flux (Band 2) = Flux_⁷Be(861 keV) + Flux_CNO(800-900 keV)**\n    *   The flux is completely dominated by the ⁷Be line. All of its ~4.5 x 10⁹ flux falls within this band.\n    *   The contribution from CNO neutrinos in this band will be similar in magnitude to the CNO contribution in Band 1 (i.e., on the order of ~10⁷).\n    *   So, Flux (Band 2) ≈ 4.5 x 10⁹ + (a small CNO contribution) ≈ **4.5 x 10⁹**.\n\n### 6. Calculate the Ratio\nRatio = Flux (Band 1) / Flux (Band 2)\nRatio ≈ (Flux from CNO in a 100 keV band) / (Flux from ⁷Be line)\nRatio ≈ (a fraction of 5 x 10⁸) / (4.5 x 10⁹)\n\nLet's compare the orders of magnitude:\n*   Numerator is on the order of ~10⁷.\n*   Denominator is on the order of ~10⁹.\n\nRatio ≈ 10⁷ / (4.5 x 10⁹) ≈ 1 / 450 ≈ 0.0022\n\nEven if we take the entire CNO flux for the numerator (a gross overestimate) and compare it to the denominator:\nRatio_max ≈ (5 x 10⁸) / (4.5 x 10⁹) ≈ 0.11\n\nSince the numerator is only a small fraction of the total CNO flux, the actual ratio must be significantly smaller than 0.11.\n\n### 7. Conclusion\nThe calculated ratio is on the order of 10⁻². Looking at the provided options:\nA) 0.01 (10⁻²)\nB) 0.1 (10⁻¹)\nC) 1.\nD) 10.\n\nThe value of 0.01 is the only one that matches our calculation. The dominant physical effect is the presence of the extremely strong ⁷Be neutrino line in Band 2, which is absent in Band 1, making the flux in Band 1 about two orders of magnitude smaller.\n\n<<<A>>>"
