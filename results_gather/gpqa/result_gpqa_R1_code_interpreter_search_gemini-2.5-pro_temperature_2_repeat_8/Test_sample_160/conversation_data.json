    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n### **1. Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   **Mean Free Path (λ):** This is the average distance a particle travels between successive collisions. The fundamental formula for mean free path is λ = 1 / (n * σ), where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the target particles (number of particles per unit volume).\n    *   `σ` is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective \"target area\" a particle presents for a collision.\n\n*   **λ1 (Molecule-Molecule Collisions):** This is the mean free path of the residual gas molecules colliding with *each other*.\n    *   **Particle:** A gas molecule.\n    *   **Target:** Other gas molecules.\n    *   **Number Density (`n`):** The density of gas molecules in the chamber.\n    *   **Collision Cross-Section (`σ1`):** The effective area for two gas molecules to collide. Because both molecules have a significant size, this cross-section is relatively large. From kinetic theory, for identical spheres of diameter `d`, this is `σ1 = πd²`.\n    *   The full formula from kinetic theory for a gas of identical particles is `λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ1)`. The `√2` factor accounts for the relative motion of all molecules (they are all moving targets).\n\n*   **λ2 (Electron-Molecule Collisions):** This is the mean free path of an electron from the beam scattering off the residual gas molecules.\n    *   **Particle:** An electron.\n    *   **Target:** Gas molecules.\n    *   **Number Density (`n`):** The density of gas molecules, which is the **same** as in the first case, since the vacuum state itself has not changed.\n    *   **Collision Cross-Section (`σ2`):** The effective area a gas molecule presents for a collision with an electron.\n    *   The formula is `λ2 = 1 / (n * σ2)`. The `√2` factor is not used here because the electrons are moving at extremely high speeds (accelerated by 1000 kV) compared to the thermal motion of the gas molecules. The gas molecules can be considered effectively stationary targets.\n\n### **2. Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ1 vs. σ2)**\n\nThe crucial difference lies in the collision cross-section.\n\n*   **For `σ1` (molecule-molecule):** Imagine two billiard balls of diameter `d` colliding. For a collision to occur, the center of one must come within a distance `d` of the center of the other. This gives an effective target area of `πd²`.\n*   **For `σ2` (electron-molecule):** Now imagine a point-like particle (the electron) colliding with a billiard ball of diameter `d`. The electron has a negligible physical radius compared to the molecule. For a collision to occur, the electron must hit the physical area of the molecule, which is `πr²` or `π(d/2)² = (1/4)πd²`.\n\nTherefore, based on this simple geometric (hard-sphere) model:\n`σ1 = πd²`\n`σ2 = (1/4)πd²`\nThis means `σ1 = 4 * σ2`, or `σ2 = σ1 / 4`.\n\nThe cross-section for an electron hitting a molecule (`σ2`) is significantly smaller than the cross-section for two molecules hitting each other (`σ1`).\n\n### **3. Calculate the Ratio of Mean Free Paths (λ2 / λ1)**\n\nNow, let's substitute the formulas and the relationship between the cross-sections:\n\n*   `λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ1)`\n*   `λ2 = 1 / (n * σ2)`\n\nThe ratio is:\n`λ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ2)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ1)]`\n`λ2 / λ1 = (√2 * n * σ1) / (n * σ2)`\n`λ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ1 / σ2)`\n\nNow, using our finding that `σ1 ≈ 4 * σ2`:\n`λ2 / λ1 ≈ √2 * 4`\n`λ2 / λ1 ≈ 1.414 * 4 = 5.656`\n\nSo, `λ2 ≈ 5.66 * λ1`.\n\n### **4. Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the mean free path for an electron in the gas (`λ2`) is significantly larger than the mean free path for the gas molecules themselves (`λ1`), by a factor of approximately 5.66.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA) `λ2 >= 1.22 * λ1`: Our result `λ2 ≈ 5.66 * λ1` fits this condition.\nB) `λ1 < λ2 < 1.22 * λ1`: Our result does not fit this condition.\nC) `λ2 < λ1`: This is the opposite of what we found.\nD) `λ2 = λ1`: This contradicts the fundamental physics.\n\nThe only plausible conclusion is that `λ2` is substantially larger than `λ1`. Option A correctly captures this relationship.\n\n<<<A>>>"
