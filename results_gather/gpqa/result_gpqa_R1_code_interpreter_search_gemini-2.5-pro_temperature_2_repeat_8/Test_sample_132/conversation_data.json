    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-).\n\n**1. Identify the chemical species in the solution.**\n*   KH2PO4 is a salt that dissociates completely in water to form K+ and dihydrogen phosphate ions (H2PO4-).\n*   Na2HPO4●2H2O is a hydrated salt that dissolves in water to form 2 Na+, hydrogen phosphate ions (HPO4^2-), and water molecules.\n*   Therefore, the initial solution contains H2PO4- and HPO4^2- ions.\n\n**2. Calculate the initial molar concentrations of H2PO4- and HPO4^2-.**\n*   Volume of the solution = 200.00 cm3 = 0.20000 L.\n*   Molar mass of KH2PO4 = 136.09 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O = 177.99 g/mol.\n\nWe can now calculate the moles of each substance and their concentrations.\n\n*   **Moles of KH2PO4 (and thus H2PO4-)**:\n    *   `moles = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007348 moles`\n    *   **[H2PO4-]** = `moles / volume = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L ≈ 0.03674 M`\n\n*   **Moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O (and thus HPO4^2-)**:\n    *   `moles = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005618 moles`\n    *   **[HPO4^2-]** = `moles / volume = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L ≈ 0.02809 M`\n\n**3. Recognize the buffer system and determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H+].**\n*   The solution contains a weak acid (H2PO4-) and its conjugate base (HPO4^2-). This constitutes a buffer solution. The relevant equilibrium is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid:\n    *   H2PO4-  ⇌  H+ + HPO4^2-\n*   The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka2 = 6.2x10^-8.\n*   We can use the Ka2 expression to find the [H+] in the buffer:\n    *   `Ka2 = ([H+] * [HPO4^2-]) / [H2PO4-]`\n*   Rearranging to solve for [H+]:\n    *   `[H+] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-])`\n    *   `[H+] = (6.2x10^-8) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M) ≈ 8.11x10^-8 M`\n\n**4. Calculate the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-).**\n*   The orthophosphate ion is formed from the third dissociation of phosphoric acid, where HPO4^2- acts as the acid:\n    *   HPO4^2-  ⇌  H+ + PO4^3-\n*   The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka3 = 1.8x10^-12.\n*   The equilibrium expression is:\n    *   `Ka3 = ([H+] * [PO4^3-]) / [HPO4^2-]`\n*   We can rearrange this equation to solve for the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, [PO4^3-]. We will use the [H+] and [HPO4^2-] concentrations that we have already determined. The dissociation of HPO4^2- into PO4^3- is very small (due to the tiny Ka3), so we can use its initial concentration.\n    *   `[PO4^3-] = Ka3 * ([HPO4^2-] / [H+])`\n    *   `[PO4^3-] = (1.8x10^-12) * (0.02809 M / 8.11x10^-8 M)`\n    *   `[PO4^3-] ≈ 6.24x10^-7 M`\n\nTo ensure precision, we can perform the full calculation with a script.\n```python\n# Molar masses (g/mol)\nmw_kh2po4 = 136.09\nmw_na2hpo4_2h2o = 177.99\n\n# Masses (g)\nmass_kh2po4 = 1.00\nmass_na2hpo4_2h2o = 1.00\n\n# Volume (L)\nvolume_L = 200.00 / 1000\n\n# Ka values\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Moles\nmoles_h2po4 = mass_kh2po4 / mw_kh2po4\nmoles_hpo4 = mass_na2hpo4_2h2o / mw_na2hpo4_2h2o\n\n# Concentrations (M)\nconc_h2po4 = moles_h2po4 / volume_L\nconc_hpo4 = moles_hpo4 / volume_L\n\n# Calculate [H+] from the buffer equilibrium (Ka2)\n# Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4-] => [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-]/[HPO4^2-]\nconc_H_plus = Ka2 * (conc_h2po4 / conc_hpo4)\n\n# Calculate [PO4^3-] from the third dissociation (Ka3)\n# Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-] => [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]/[H+]\nconc_po4_3_minus = Ka3 * (conc_hpo4 / conc_H_plus)\n\nprint(f\"{conc_po4_3_minus:.2e}\")\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "**Detailed Step-by-Step Derivation:**\n\n1.  **Calculate Initial Molarities:**\n    *   First, we determine the number of moles for each salt.\n        *   Moles of KH₂PO₄ = `mass / molar mass` = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 moles\n        *   Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O = `mass / molar mass` = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 moles\n    *   Next, we calculate the molar concentration of the ions in the 200.00 mL (0.20000 L) solution. Since both salts dissociate completely:\n        *   Initial [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M\n        *   Initial [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M\n\n2.  **Determine the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H⁺]:**\n    *   The solution contains a weak acid (H₂PO₄⁻) and its conjugate base (HPO₄²⁻), which forms a buffer solution. The equilibrium governing this buffer is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid:\n        H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n    *   The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Kₐ₂ = 6.2x10⁻⁸. We can rearrange the expression for Kₐ₂ to solve for [H⁺]:\n        Kₐ₂ = `([H⁺][HPO₄²⁻]) / [H₂PO₄⁻]`\n        [H⁺] = Kₐ₂ * `([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])`\n    *   Plugging in the concentrations:\n        [H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n        [H⁺] ≈ 8.11x10⁻⁸ M\n\n3.  **Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion [PO₄³⁻] Concentration:**\n    *   The orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is formed from the third dissociation step, where hydrogen phosphate (HPO₄²⁻) acts as the acid:\n        HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n    *   The equilibrium constant for this is Kₐ₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹². We can rearrange the expression for Kₐ₃ to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\n        Kₐ₃ = `([H⁺][PO₄³⁻]) / [HPO₄²⁻]`\n        [PO₄³⁻] = Kₐ₃ * `([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])`\n    *   Because Kₐ₃ is extremely small, the concentration of HPO₄²⁻ does not change significantly. We can use its initial concentration and the [H⁺] calculated in the previous step.\n        [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11x10⁻⁸ M)\n        [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.24x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe calculated concentration matches the value from the code execution.\n\n<<<D>>>"
