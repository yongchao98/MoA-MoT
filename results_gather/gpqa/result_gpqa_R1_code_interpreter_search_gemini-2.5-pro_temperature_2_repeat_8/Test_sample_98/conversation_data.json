    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### 1. Analysis of FTIR Data\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded environment. The broadness is a hallmark of the O-H group in a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. Its position is consistent with the carbonyl group of a carboxylic acid (typically 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n### 2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data\n\nThe key to identifying the correct structure lies in analyzing the complex splitting patterns (multiplicities) described. We need a single molecule that exhibits *both* of the following signals:\n\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** A proton responsible for this signal must be coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1) to cause the doublet splitting (n+1 = 2).\n    *   Two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2) to cause the triplet splitting (n+1 = 3).\n    *   Three equivalent neighboring protons (n=3) to cause the quartet splitting (n+1 = 4).\n    *   In summary, this proton must be adjacent to a methine (-CH), a methylene (-CH₂), and a methyl (-CH₃) group.\n\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** A proton responsible for this signal must be coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1) to cause the doublet splitting (n+1 = 2).\n    *   Two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2) to cause the first triplet splitting (n+1 = 3).\n    *   Another set of two equivalent, but non-identical, neighboring protons (n=2) to cause the second triplet splitting (n+1 = 3).\n    *   In summary, this proton must be adjacent to a methine (-CH) and two different methylene (-CH₂) groups.\n\n### 3. Evaluating Each Candidate Structure\n\nLet's find the IUPAC names and analyze the expected splitting for the protons on the main chain of each molecule.\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n```\n      CH₃(g) CH₃(f)\n       |      |\nCH₃(e)-CH₂(d)-CH(c)--CH(b)--COOH(a)\n```\n*   **Proton H(c):** This proton is adjacent to:\n    *   Proton H(b) (a 1H group) → creates a doublet (d).\n    *   The CH₂(d) group (a 2H group) → creates a triplet (t).\n    *   The CH₃(f) group (a 3H group) → creates a quartet (q).\n*   Thus, proton H(c) gives a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This perfectly matches the first signal.\n*   However, let's look for a proton that could give a `dtt`. For a `dtt`, a proton needs to be adjacent to one -CH and two different -CH₂ groups. This molecule only contains one -CH₂ group in total (the `d` protons). Therefore, **molecule A cannot produce a `dtt` signal**.\n\n**B) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n```\n      CH₃   CH₃\n       |     |\nCH₃ -- CH -- CH -- CH₂ -- COOH\n  (5)  (4)   (3)   (2)    (1)\n```\n*   **Proton H(3):** Is adjacent to CH₂(2) (a 2H group, giving a triplet), H(4) (a 1H group, giving a doublet), and its own CH₃ group (a 3H group, giving a quartet). This results in a **triplet of doublets of quartets (tdq)**. This does not match the required `dtq` or `dtt`.\n\n**C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n```\n          Et(c)\n           |\nCH₃-CH₂ --CH(b)--CH(a)--COOH\n      (e)   |      |\n            Et(d)  Et(g)\n```\n(where Et = -CH₂CH₃)\n*   **Proton H(b):** This proton is on C3 of the pentanoic acid chain and is adjacent to:\n    *   Proton H(a) at C2 (a 1H group) → creates a doublet (d).\n    *   The CH₂ group of the main chain at C4 (let's call it CH₂(e)) → creates a triplet (t).\n    *   The CH₂ group of the ethyl substituent on its own carbon (let's call it CH₂(d)) → creates another triplet (t).\n*   Thus, proton H(b) gives a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This perfectly matches the second signal.\n*   Now, let's look for a proton that could give a `dtq`. For a `dtq`, a proton must be adjacent to a -CH, a -CH₂, and a -CH₃. There are no protons in this molecule with that specific set of three different types of neighbours. For example, the protons on the methylene groups of the ethyl side chains (e.g., in `d` or `g`) are next to a methine (-CH) and a methyl (-CH₃). Because the molecule is chiral, these methylene protons are diastereotopic and will also split each other (geminal coupling). This leads to `ddq` (doublet of doublets of quartets) signals, not `dtq` signals. Therefore, **molecule C cannot produce a `dtq` signal under normal circumstances.**\n\n**D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\n*   This structure's key protons give signals like **triplet of doublets of triplets (tdt)** and **quartet of doublets of triplets (qdt)**. Neither of these match the required signals.\n\n### 4. Final Conclusion\n\nThere is a contradiction in the problem statement. No single molecule from the list can unambiguously produce *both* a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal based on standard splitting rules.\n*   Molecule **A** perfectly explains the **`dtq`** signal.\n*   Molecule **C** perfectly explains the **`dtt`** signal.\n\nHowever, in a multiple-choice context, we must select the best possible fit. Let's reconsider molecule **C**. It unequivocally produces the `dtt` signal. It also produces other complex signals, such as multiple `ddq`s (doublet of doublets of quartets) from the diastereotopic methylene protons. It is conceivable, though a stretch, that one of these `ddq` signals could be mistaken for or reported as a `dtq`, perhaps due to poor resolution or accidental equivalence of coupling constants. Molecule A, on the other hand, has no structural feature that could possibly lead to a `dtt` signal. Therefore, Molecule C is the more plausible candidate as it explains one complex signal perfectly and possesses other complex signals that are structurally related to the second required signal.\n\nThe presence of the very specific **`dtt`** signal is strong evidence pointing towards the structure of **2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
