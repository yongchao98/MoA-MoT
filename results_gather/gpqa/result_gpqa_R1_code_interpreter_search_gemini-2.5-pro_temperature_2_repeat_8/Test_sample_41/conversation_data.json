    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance.**\n    The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet orbiting a star is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from the star and the energy it radiates as thermal radiation. The formula is:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n    where:\n    *   $T_{star}$ is the star's temperature.\n    *   $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (the orbital distance for a circular orbit).\n    *   `A` is the planet's Bond albedo.\n\n    Since all three planets orbit the same star, $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are constant for all of them. The problem states that the albedo `A` is also the same for all three planets. Therefore, the formula simplifies to:\n    $T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n    This means that the square of the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the orbital distance:\n    $T_{eq}^2 \\propto \\frac{1}{a}$\n    From this, we can write a ratio for any two planets, `i` and `j`, in the system:\n    $\\frac{a_j}{a_i} = \\left( \\frac{T_{eq,i}}{T_{eq,j}} \\right)^2$\n\n2.  **Calculate the ratio of orbital distances ($a_3/a_1$).**\n    We are given the temperature ratios:\n    *   $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2} = 1.4$\n    *   $T_{eq2} / T_{eq3} = 2.3$\n\n    First, let's find the ratio of the orbital distances for Planet 2 to Planet 1 ($a_2/a_1$):\n    $a_2/a_1 = (T_{eq1} / T_{eq2})^2 = 1.4^2 = 1.96$\n\n    Next, let's find the ratio for Planet 3 to Planet 2 ($a_3/a_2$):\n    $a_3/a_2 = (T_{eq2} / T_{eq3})^2 = 2.3^2 = 5.29$\n\n    To find the overall ratio of the orbital distance of Planet 3 to Planet 1 ($a_3/a_1$), we multiply the individual ratios:\n    $a_3/a_1 = (a_3/a_2) \\times (a_2/a_1) = 5.29 \\times 1.96 = 10.3684$\n\n3.  **Relate Orbital Distance to Orbital Period using Kepler's Third Law.**\n    Kepler's Third Law states that the square of a planet's orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (`a`):\n    $P^2 \\propto a^3$\n    This implies that the period is proportional to the semi-major axis to the power of 3/2:\n    $P \\propto a^{3/2}$\n\n    *Note: The information about the planet masses and the TTV discovery method is extra information. For this type of problem, it is assumed that the mass of the planets is negligible compared to the mass of the star, so the simplified form of Kepler's law is sufficient.*\n\n4.  **Calculate the ratio of the orbital periods ($P_3/P_1$).**\n    Using the relationship from Kepler's Law, we can find the ratio of the periods for Planet 3 and Planet 1:\n    $\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \\left( \\frac{a_3}{a_1} \\right)^{3/2}$\n\n    Now, we substitute the value we found for $a_3/a_1$:\n    $\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.3684)^{3/2} = (10.3684)^{1.5}$\n\nTo compute the final value, a calculator or a simple script can be used.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Given temperature ratios\nT1_div_T2 = 1.4\nT2_div_T3 = 2.3\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes a3/a1\n# a2/a1 = (T1/T2)^2\n# a3/a2 = (T2/T3)^2\n# a3/a1 = (a3/a2) * (a2/a1)\na3_div_a1 = (T2_div_T3**2) * (T1_div_T2**2)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the ratio of the orbital periods P3/P1 using Kepler's Third Law\n# P3/P1 = (a3/a1)^(3/2)\nP3_div_P1 = a3_div_a1**1.5\n\nprint(f\"{P3_div_P1:.1f}\")\n```\n\n33.4\n\nThe final calculation shows that the orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33.4 times larger than that of Planet1.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Relate Equilibrium Temperature to Orbital Distance**: The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is related to its orbital distance (`a`) from its star. The formula for equilibrium temperature is:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n    where $T_{star}$ is the star's temperature, $R_{star}$ is the star's radius, and `A` is the planet's albedo. Since all three planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, the terms $T_{star}$, $R_{star}$, and `A` are constant. Therefore, the relationship simplifies to:\n    $T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n    This means the square of the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the orbital distance:\n    $a \\propto \\frac{1}{T_{eq}^2}$\n    So, for any two planets `i` and `j` in the system, the ratio of their orbital distances is:\n    $\\frac{a_j}{a_i} = \\left( \\frac{T_{eq,i}}{T_{eq,j}} \\right)^2$\n\n2.  **Calculate the Ratio of Orbital Distances**: We are given the temperature ratios:\n    *   $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = 1.4$\n    *   $\\frac{T_{eq2}}{T_{eq3}} = 2.3$\n\n    First, we find the ratio of the orbital distances for Planet 2 to Planet 1 ($a_2/a_1$):\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left( \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} \\right)^2 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96$\n\n    Next, we find the ratio for Planet 3 to Planet 2 ($a_3/a_2$):\n    $\\frac{a_3}{a_2} = \\left( \\frac{T_{eq2}}{T_{eq3}} \\right)^2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29$\n\n    To find the overall ratio of the orbital distance of Planet 3 to Planet 1 ($a_3/a_1$), we can multiply the individual ratios:\n    $\\frac{a_3}{a_1} = \\frac{a_3}{a_2} \\times \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = 5.29 \\times 1.96 = 10.3684$\n\n3.  **Use Kepler's Third Law to find the Period Ratio**: Kepler's Third Law states that the square of a planet's orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (`a`).\n    $P^2 \\propto a^3$\n    (Note: The given mass ratios and the fact that the system was discovered via the TTV method are extraneous details, as we assume the planets' masses are negligible compared to the star's mass, a common simplification in such problems).\n\n    From Kepler's law, we can establish a ratio of the periods:\n    $\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \\left( \\frac{a_3}{a_1} \\right)^{3/2}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Answer**: Now, we substitute the value of the orbital distance ratio we calculated:\n    $\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.3684)^{3/2} \\approx 33.4$\n\nThe code execution confirmed this calculation. The orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 by a factor of approximately 33.4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
