    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the electric field at point P.\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial state and charge placement:** We start with an uncharged spherical conductor. A positive charge $+q$ is then placed inside a spherical cavity within the conductor. The conductor itself is isolated.\n\n2.  **Electrostatic Induction:** The presence of the positive charge $+q$ inside the cavity will cause the free charges (electrons) within the conductor to redistribute themselves.\n    *   To cancel the electric field produced by $+q$ inside the conducting material (a key property of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium), a total charge of $-q$ will be induced on the inner surface of the cavity.\n    *   The conductor was initially electrically neutral (charge = 0). Since a charge of $-q$ has moved to the inner surface, a charge of $+q$ must be left on the outer surface of the conductor to maintain overall charge neutrality for the conductor itself.\n\n3.  **Charge Distribution:**\n    *   **Inner Surface:** The induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the cavity will not be uniformly distributed. It will be denser on the parts of the wall closer to the location of the charge $+q$.\n    *   **Outer Surface:** The charge $+q$ on the outer surface is shielded from the electric field of the charges inside the cavity (+q and the induced -q). This is a fundamental property of conductors known as electrostatic shielding. Because the outer surface is a perfect sphere and it is shielded from the asymmetric configuration inside, the charge $+q$ will distribute itself uniformly over the outer surface.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Electric Field at Point P:** The electric field at any external point P is the vector sum of the fields produced by all charges in the system:\n    *   The original charge $+q$ inside the cavity.\n    *   The induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the cavity.\n    *   The induced charge $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n5.  **Applying the Shielding Principle:** The combination of the charge $+q$ inside the cavity and the induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface produces zero electric field everywhere outside the cavity. This is because the conductor rearranges the charge on the inner wall to perfectly cancel the field from the internal charge $+q$ within the bulk of the conductor and thus everywhere outside of it.\n\n6.  **Contribution from the Outer Surface:** Therefore, the only charge distribution that contributes to the electric field at the external point P is the uniform charge $+q$ on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n7.  **Applying the Shell Theorem (or Gauss's Law):** According to the shell theorem, for any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell, the electric field is identical to that of a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   Total charge on the outer surface = $+q$.\n    *   Center of the outer sphere = Center of the conductor (let's call it O).\n    *   Distance from the center O to the point P = $L$.\n\n8.  **Final Calculation:** The magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{Total charge on outer surface}}{(\\text{distance from center})^2}$\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n**Conclusion:** The various other distances and angles provided in the problem (like $r, s, l, \\theta$) are irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor due to the principle of electrostatic shielding. The external field only depends on the total charge that moves to the outer surface and the distance from the center of the conductor.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
