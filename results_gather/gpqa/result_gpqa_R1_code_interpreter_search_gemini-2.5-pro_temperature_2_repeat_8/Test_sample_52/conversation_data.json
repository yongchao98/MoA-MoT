    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Information Provided\n\n*   **Structure:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This typically refers to a benzene ring with two substituents, so we have a C6H4 core.\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** An absorption peak indicates an ester group (-COO-). This tells us the molecule contains at least two oxygen atoms.\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum:** The spectrum provides crucial details about the hydrogen environments in the molecule.\n    *   **Six signals total:** This indicates six chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4) has four aromatic protons. Having only two signals suggests a high degree of symmetry, which is characteristic of a **1,4-disubstitution (para)** pattern. In this pattern, there are two sets of two equivalent protons, leading to two signals (typically two doublets).\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (alkene protons):**\n        *   One signal is a **doublet (d)**.\n        *   The other is a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n        *   This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**. The vinyl proton adjacent to the other vinyl proton is split into a doublet. The other vinyl proton is split by both the adjacent vinyl proton (into a doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (into a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. This identifies one of the substituents as `-CH=CH-CH3`.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:**\n        *   One methyl signal comes from the propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`) identified above.\n        *   The second methyl signal must be part of the ester group. Common ester functionalities involving a methyl group are a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate (`-OCOCH3`). Both possibilities provide a second, distinct methyl signal.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a key constraint, ruling out structures containing ethyl, propyl, or allyl (`-CH2-CH=CH2`) groups.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (also known as double bond equivalents) can be calculated from the structural features:\n*   Benzene ring: Contains 1 ring and 3 double bonds = 4 DBE\n*   Ester group (-COO-): Contains one C=O double bond = 1 DBE\n*   Vinyl group (-CH=CH-): Contains one C=C double bond = 1 DBE\n\n**Total DBE from structure = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6**\n\nNow, let's calculate the DBE for each of the given chemical formulas using the formula: DBE = C + 1 - (H/2).\n*   A) C11H14O2: DBE = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 12 - 7 = 5\n*   B) C12H14O2: DBE = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 13 - 7 = 6\n*   C) C11H12O2: DBE = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6\n*   D) C12H12O2: DBE = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 13 - 6 = 7\n\nComparing the DBE values, we can immediately rule out options A and D, as their DBEs (5 and 7, respectively) do not match the required DBE of 6. This leaves C11H12O2 and C12H14O2 as possibilities.\n\n### 3. Assemble the Molecule and Determine the Formula\n\nWe can now build the molecule from the fragments identified from the spectroscopic data and sum the atoms to find the correct formula.\n\n*   **Fragment 1: Aromatic Ring**\n    *   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring has the formula **C6H4**.\n*   **Fragment 2: Vinyl Substituent**\n    *   The propenyl group that fits the NMR data is `-CH=CH-CH3`. As a substituent, it has the formula **-C3H5**. (1 vinyl H + 1 vinyl H + 3 methyl H = 5 H).\n*   **Fragment 3: Ester Substituent**\n    *   This substituent must contain the ester functionality (`-COO-`) and the second methyl group.\n    *   Option 1: Methyl ester group, `-COOCH3`. This has the formula **-C2H3O2**.\n    *   Option 2: Acetate group attached via oxygen, `-OCOCH3`. This also has the formula **-C2H3O2**.\n    *   Both these fragments are consistent with the \"no -CH2-\" rule.\n\nNow, let's combine the atoms from these fragments:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from -C3H5) + 2 (from -C2H3O2) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from -C3H5) + 3 (from -C2H3O2) = **12**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from the ester group) = **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\nThis formula is fully consistent with all the provided data: it corresponds to a plausible structure (e.g., methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate), matches the detailed NMR signals, contains an ester group, is di-substituted, has no -CH2- groups, and has the correct degree of unsaturation (DBE = 6).\n\nThe other possibility, C12H14O2, can be ruled out because it is impossible to construct a molecule with this formula that satisfies all the specific NMR constraints (particularly the fragments identified and the absence of -CH2- groups).\n\n### 4. Final Conclusion\n\nThe spectroscopic evidence strongly and uniquely points to the molecular formula C11H12O2."
