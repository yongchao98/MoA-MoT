    "The problem asks for the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X, given its production energy ($E_X$), mass ($m_X$), and decay width ($\\Gamma_X$).\n\nHere is the reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the goal:** The objective is to calculate the mean decay distance, $L$, of the particle X in the laboratory frame.\n\n2.  **Recall the relevant physics principles:**\n    *   A particle moving at a relativistic speed $v$ has a lifetime in the lab frame, $\\tau$, which is dilated with respect to its proper lifetime, $\\tau_0$. The relation is $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The proper lifetime $\\tau_0$ of a resonance is inversely related to its decay width $\\Gamma$ by the uncertainty principle: $\\tau_0 = \\hbar / \\Gamma$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n    *   The mean distance traveled by the particle before it decays is the product of its speed and its mean lifetime in the lab frame: $L = v \\tau$.\n\n3.  **Formulate the equation:**\n    *   Combining the principles above, the mean decay distance is $L = v \\tau = v (\\gamma \\tau_0) = \\gamma v \\tau_0$.\n    *   We can write this as $L = (\\gamma \\beta) c \\tau_0$, where $\\beta = v/c$.\n    *   Substitute $\\tau_0 = \\hbar/\\Gamma_X$: $L = (\\gamma \\beta) c \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X} = (\\gamma \\beta) \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$.\n    *   To calculate $\\gamma \\beta$, we can use the relativistic energy-momentum relations. The total energy is $E_X = \\gamma m_X c^2$, and the momentum is $p = \\gamma m_X v = \\gamma m_X \\beta c$.\n    *   From the momentum relation, we can write $pc = (\\gamma \\beta) m_X c^2$, which gives $\\gamma \\beta = \\frac{pc}{m_X c^2}$.\n    *   Substituting this into the equation for $L$: $L = \\frac{pc}{m_X c^2} \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$.\n    *   The relativistic momentum can be found from the energy-momentum relation: $E_X^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_X c^2)^2$. Therefore, $pc = \\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}$.\n    *   The final formula for the mean decay distance is:\n        $L = \\frac{\\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}}{m_X c^2} \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$.\n\n4.  **List the given values and constants:**\n    *   Production energy: $E_X = 8 \\, \\text{GeV} = 8000 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n    *   Mass (in energy units): $m_X c^2 = 1.2 \\, \\text{GeV} = 1200 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n    *   Decay width: $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n    *   A useful physical constant is the product of the reduced Planck constant and the speed of light: $\\hbar c \\approx 197.327 \\, \\text{MeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}$, where $1 \\, \\text{fm} = 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}$.\n\n5.  **Perform the calculation:**\n    *   First, calculate the momentum term, $pc$:\n        $pc = \\sqrt{(8000 \\, \\text{MeV})^2 - (1200 \\, \\text{MeV})^2}$\n        $pc = \\sqrt{64,000,000 - 1,440,000} \\, \\text{MeV}$\n        $pc = \\sqrt{62,560,000} \\, \\text{MeV} \\approx 7909.488 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n    *   Now, substitute all the values into the formula for $L$:\n        $L = \\frac{7909.488 \\, \\text{MeV}}{1200 \\, \\text{MeV}} \\times \\frac{197.327 \\, \\text{MeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}}{320 \\, \\text{MeV}}$\n        $L \\approx 6.59124 \\times 0.616647 \\, \\text{fm}$\n        $L \\approx 4.06554 \\, \\text{fm}$\n    *   Finally, convert the result from femtometers (fm) to meters (m):\n        $L \\approx 4.06554 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}$.\n\nTo ensure precision, let's use a Python script to perform the calculation.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given values in MeV\nE_X = 8000.0  # Production energy\nm_X_c2 = 1200.0 # Mass\nGamma_X = 320.0 # Width\n\n# Physical constant in MeV*fm\nhbar_c = 197.3269804\n\n# Calculate the momentum in MeV/c\npc = np.sqrt(E_X**2 - m_X_c2**2)\n\n# Calculate the mean decay distance in femtometers (fm)\n# L = (pc / m_X_c2) * (hbar_c / Gamma_X)\nL_fm = (pc / m_X_c2) * (hbar_c / Gamma_X)\n\n# Convert fm to m (1 fm = 10^-15 m)\nL_m = L_fm * 1e-15\n\n# Print the result in scientific notation\nprint(f'{L_m:.4e}')\n```\n<execute_result>\n4.0655e-15\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated value is $4.0655 \\times 10^{-15}$ m.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to find the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X.\n\n1.  **Understand the Quantities:**\n    *   Production Energy ($E_X$): The total energy of the particle in the laboratory frame. Given as $E_X = 8 \\, \\text{GeV} = 8000 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n    *   Mass ($m_X$): The rest mass of the particle. The rest mass energy is given as $m_X c^2 = 1.2 \\, \\text{GeV} = 1200 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n    *   Decay Width ($\\Gamma_X$): This is related to the instability of the particle. It determines the particle's proper lifetime. Given as $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n\n2.  **Relate Decay Width to Proper Lifetime:**\n    The proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) of a particle (its lifetime in its own rest frame) is related to its decay width ($\\Gamma_X$) through the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The relationship is:\n    $\\tau_0 = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\n    where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n3.  **Account for Relativistic Effects (Time Dilation):**\n    The particle is moving at a relativistic speed in the laboratory frame. Due to time dilation, its lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau$) will be longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$). The relation is:\n    $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$\n    where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, defined as $\\gamma = \\frac{E_X}{m_X c^2}$.\n\n    Let's calculate the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{8000 \\, \\text{MeV}}{1200 \\, \\text{MeV}} = \\frac{80}{12} = \\frac{20}{3} \\approx 6.667$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Distance:**\n    The mean decay distance ($L$) is the distance the particle travels in the lab frame during its lab-frame lifetime ($\\tau$). This is given by:\n    $L = v \\tau$\n    where $v$ is the particle's velocity.\n\n    We can express this more conveniently. We know that $v = \\beta c$, where $\\beta = v/c$. So, $L = \\beta c \\tau = \\beta c (\\gamma \\tau_0)$.\n    Substituting $\\tau_0 = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$, we get:\n    $L = (\\gamma \\beta) c \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X} = (\\gamma \\beta) \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\n    We need to find the term $\\gamma\\beta$. We can find it from the relativistic momentum.\n    The total energy is $E_X = \\gamma m_X c^2$.\n    The momentum is $p = \\gamma m_X v = \\gamma m_X (\\beta c) = (\\gamma \\beta) m_X c$.\n    From the relativistic energy-momentum relation, $E_X^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_X c^2)^2$, we can find the momentum energy $pc$:\n    $(pc)^2 = E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2$\n    $pc = \\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}$\n\n    Now we can find $\\gamma\\beta$:\n    $p = (\\gamma\\beta) m_X c \\implies pc = (\\gamma\\beta) m_X c^2$\n    So, $\\gamma\\beta = \\frac{pc}{m_X c^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}}{m_X c^2}$\n\n    Plugging this back into the formula for $L$:\n    $L = \\frac{\\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}}{m_X c^2} \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\n5.  **Perform the Numerical Calculation:**\n    *   **Given values:**\n        *   $E_X = 8000 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n        *   $m_X c^2 = 1200 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n        *   $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n    *   **Constant:**\n        *   The product $\\hbar c$ is a useful constant in particle physics: $\\hbar c \\approx 197.327 \\, \\text{MeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}$ (where 1 fm = $10^{-15}$ m).\n\n    *   **Calculate the momentum term:**\n        $\\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(8000)^2 - (1200)^2} \\, \\text{MeV} = \\sqrt{64,000,000 - 1,440,000} \\, \\text{MeV}$\n        $= \\sqrt{62,560,000} \\, \\text{MeV} \\approx 7909.49 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\n    *   **Calculate L in femtometers (fm):**\n        $L = \\left( \\frac{7909.49 \\, \\text{MeV}}{1200 \\, \\text{MeV}} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{197.327 \\, \\text{MeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}}{320 \\, \\text{MeV}} \\right)$\n        $L \\approx (6.5912) \\times (0.6166 \\, \\text{fm})$\n        $L \\approx 4.0655 \\, \\text{fm}$\n\n    *   **Convert to meters:**\n        Since $1 \\, \\text{fm} = 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}$, the mean decay distance is:\n        $L \\approx 4.0655 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}$\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m\nB) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m\nC) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m\nD) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
