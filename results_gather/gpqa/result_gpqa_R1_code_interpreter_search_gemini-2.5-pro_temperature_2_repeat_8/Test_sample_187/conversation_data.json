    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the interplanar distance for the (111) plane of a rhombohedral crystal.\n\n### 1. Identify Given Information\n- Crystal System: Rhombohedral\n- Lattice parameters: The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. For a rhombohedral crystal, the lattice constants are equal ($a=b=c$). We'll assume the interatomic distance corresponds to the lattice constant, so $a = 10$ Å.\n- Interaxial angles: $\\alpha = \\beta = \\gamma = 30^\\circ$\n- Miller indices of the plane: $(hkl) = (111)$\n\n### 2. Select the Appropriate Formula\nThe formula for the interplanar distance, $d_{hkl}$, in a rhombohedral crystal system is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{d^2} = \\frac{(h^2+k^2+l^2)\\sin^2\\alpha + 2(hk+kl+lh)(\\cos^2\\alpha-\\cos\\alpha)}{a^2(1 - 3\\cos^2\\alpha + 2\\cos^3\\alpha)} $$\n\n### 3. Calculate Necessary Components\nFirst, let's calculate the terms based on the given values:\n- $a = 10$ Å\n- $h=1, k=1, l=1$\n- $\\alpha = 30^\\circ$\n\nFrom these, we can compute:\n- $a^2 = 10^2 = 100$\n- $h^2+k^2+l^2 = 1^2+1^2+1^2 = 3$\n- $hk+kl+lh = (1)(1)+(1)(1)+(1)(1) = 3$\n- $\\alpha = 30^\\circ$\n- $\\sin(30^\\circ) = 1/2$\n- $\\cos(30^\\circ) = \\sqrt{3}/2$\n- $\\sin^2(30^\\circ) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4$\n- $\\cos^2(30^\\circ) = (\\sqrt{3}/2)^2 = 3/4$\n- $\\cos^3(30^\\circ) = (\\sqrt{3}/2)^3 = 3\\sqrt{3}/8$\n\n### 4. Substitute Values into the Formula\nNow, we substitute these calculated components back into the formula for $1/d^2$.\n\nLet's compute the numerator of the formula:\nNumerator = $(h^2+k^2+l^2)\\sin^2\\alpha + 2(hk+kl+lh)(\\cos^2\\alpha-\\cos\\alpha)$\nNumerator = $3 \\cdot (1/4) + 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot (3/4 - \\sqrt{3}/2)$\nNumerator = $3/4 + 6(3/4 - \\sqrt{3}/2)$\nNumerator = $3/4 + 18/4 - 3\\sqrt{3}$\nNumerator = $21/4 - 3\\sqrt{3}$\n\nNext, let's compute the denominator of the formula:\nDenominator = $a^2(1 - 3\\cos^2\\alpha + 2\\cos^3\\alpha)$\nDenominator = $100 \\cdot (1 - 3(3/4) + 2(3\\sqrt{3}/8))$\nDenominator = $100 \\cdot (1 - 9/4 + 6\\sqrt{3}/8)$\nDenominator = $100 \\cdot (1 - 9/4 + 3\\sqrt{3}/4)$\nDenominator = $100 \\cdot (\\frac{4 - 9 + 3\\sqrt{3}}{4})$\nDenominator = $100 \\cdot (\\frac{3\\sqrt{3} - 5}{4})$\nDenominator = $25(3\\sqrt{3} - 5)$\n\nNow combine them to find $1/d^2$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{d^2} = \\frac{21/4 - 3\\sqrt{3}}{25(3\\sqrt{3} - 5)} = \\frac{21 - 12\\sqrt{3}}{100(3\\sqrt{3} - 5)} $$\n\n### 5. Numerical Calculation\nTo get the final value, we'll use numerical approximations or a calculator. We can also perform this calculation using a Python script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given parameters\na = 10  # Angstrom\nalpha_deg = 30\nh, k, l = 1, 1, 1\n\n# Convert angle to radians for use in math functions\nalpha_rad = math.radians(alpha_deg)\n\n# Calculate trigonometric values\ncos_a = math.cos(alpha_rad)\nsin_a = math.sin(alpha_rad)\n\n# Numerator of the 1/d^2 formula\nnumerator = (h**2 + k**2 + l**2) * sin_a**2 + 2 * (h*k + k*l + l*h) * (cos_a**2 - cos_a)\n\n# Denominator of the 1/d^2 formula\ndenominator = a**2 * (1 - 3*cos_a**2 + 2*cos_a**3)\n\n# Calculate 1/d^2\ninv_d_squared = numerator / denominator\n\n# Calculate d\nd = 1 / math.sqrt(inv_d_squared)\n\nprint(f\"{d:.2f}\")\n```\n```output\n9.54\n```\nThe calculation yields approximately 9.54 Å.\n\n### 6. Conclusion\nThe calculated interplanar distance for the (111) plane is 9.54 Å. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
