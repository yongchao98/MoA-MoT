    "Answering this question requires combining the formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature with Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion.\n\n**1. Equilibrium Temperature:**\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\n`T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))`\nWhere:\n*   `T_star` is the star's temperature.\n*   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n*   `A` is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 (T_eq4) and Planet_2 (T_eq2).\n`Ratio = T_eq4 / T_eq2`\n\nLet's write out the ratio:\n`Ratio = [T_star * (1 - A_4)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_4))] / [T_star * (1 - A_2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))]`\n\nAccording to the problem statement:\n*   The planets orbit the same star, so `T_star` and `R_star` are the same for both and will cancel out.\n*   The planets have the same albedo, so `A_4 = A_2`, and the `(1 - A)^(1/4)` terms will also cancel out.\n\nAfter simplification, the equation becomes:\n`Ratio = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_4)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))`\n`Ratio = sqrt( (1 / a_4) / (1 / a_2) )`\n`Ratio = sqrt(a_2 / a_4)`\n\nThis shows the ratio of the temperatures is inversely proportional to the square root of the ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n**2. Kepler's Third Law:**\nKepler's Third Law states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (`a`):\n`P² ∝ a³` or `a ∝ P^(2/3)`\n\nWe can use this relationship to find the ratio `a_2 / a_4`:\n`a_2 / a_4 = (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3)`\n\n**3. Combining the Equations:**\nNow, substitute the expression for `a_2 / a_4` back into the temperature ratio equation:\n`Ratio = sqrt( (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3) )`\n`Ratio = (P_2 / P_4)^((2/3) * (1/2))`\n`Ratio = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)`\n\n**4. Calculation:**\nThe problem gives the ratio of the orbital periods as `1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5`.\nFrom this, we have:\n*   `P_2` corresponds to the value `2`.\n*   `P_4` corresponds to the value `3.5`.\n\nThe ratio `P_2 / P_4 = 2 / 3.5`.\n\nNow, we calculate the final temperature ratio:\n`Ratio = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)`\n\nLet's compute the numerical value.\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio of the orbital periods\np_ratio = 2 / 3.5\n\n# Calculate the cube root of the period ratio to find the temperature ratio\ntemp_ratio = p_ratio**(1/3)\n\nprint(temp_ratio)\n```\n```output\n0.8299240406857858\n```\nThe calculated ratio is approximately `0.83`.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures (`T_eq`) between two planets (Planet_4 and Planet_2) orbiting the same star with the same albedo is given by:\n\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_4)`\n\nwhere `a` is the semi-major axis of the orbit.\n\nAccording to Kepler's Third Law, the square of the orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (`a³`):\n\n`P² ∝ a³  => a ∝ P^(2/3)`\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the semi-major axes can be expressed in terms of the ratio of the orbital periods:\n\n`a_2 / a_4 = (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3)`\n\nSubstituting this back into the temperature ratio equation:\n\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 = sqrt((P_2 / P_4)^(2/3)) = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)`\n\nGiven the orbital period ratios are `1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5`, we have:\n*   `P_2` is proportional to `2`.\n*   `P_4` is proportional to `3.5`.\n\nThe ratio `P_2 / P_4` is `2 / 3.5`.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is:\n\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)`\n\nThe code output confirms the calculation:\n`(2 / 3.5)^(1/3) ≈ 0.8298`\n\nThis value, when rounded to two decimal places, is `0.83`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
