    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Core Chemical Process**\n\nTo dissolve iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, which is a sparingly soluble base, we need to add a strong acid. The acid neutralizes the hydroxide ions, shifting the solubility equilibrium to the right until all the solid is dissolved.\n\nThe overall reaction is:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nThe problem asks for two things: the minimum volume of acid required and the pH of the resulting solution. In a multiple-choice question, the correct answer pair must be chemically consistent.\n\n**2. Stoichiometric Requirement**\n\nFirst, let's calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ we need to dissolve and the absolute minimum amount of acid required just to neutralize it, without leaving any excess acid.\n\n*   Molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.845 (Fe) + 3 × (15.999 (O) + 1.008 (H)) = 106.866 g/mol\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 0.00093575 mol\n\nFrom the stoichiometry of the reaction (Fe(OH)₃ + **3**H⁺), we need 3 moles of H⁺ for every 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n\n*   Moles of H⁺ required for neutralization = 3 × 0.00093575 mol ≈ 0.0028073 mol\n\nThe acid is 0.1 M, meaning 0.1 moles of H⁺ per liter.\n\n*   Volume of acid for neutralization = moles / molarity = 0.0028073 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.028073 L\n*   Volume in cm³ = 0.028073 L × 1000 cm³/L ≈ 28.07 cm³\n\nThis is the volume of acid needed just to complete the reaction. To have an acidic final pH (all options have pH < 7), we must add *more* acid than this amount. Any option with a volume less than or equal to 28.07 cm³ must be incorrect.\n\n*   A) 30.09 cm³ (> 28.07) - Possible\n*   B) 20.40 cm³ (< 28.07) - Impossible\n*   C) 28.05 cm³ (< 28.07) - Impossible\n*   D) 32.14 cm³ (> 28.07) - Possible\n\nThis analysis eliminates options B and C.\n\n**3. Test Remaining Options for Consistency (Mole Balance)**\n\nThe total amount of H⁺ added from the acid is used for two purposes:\n1.  Neutralizing the Fe(OH)₃ (`n_reacted`).\n2.  Establishing the final H⁺ concentration in the 100 cm³ solution (`n_final`).\n\nThis can be expressed as a mole balance equation:\n**`Total moles H⁺ added` = `Moles H⁺ reacted` + `Moles H⁺ remaining in final solution`**\n\nWe can write this as:\n**`(V_acid × M_acid)` = `(3 × n_Fe(OH)₃)` + `([H⁺]_final × V_total)`**\n\nLet's test the remaining options (A and D) to see which one satisfies this equation. The values we already know are:\n*   `3 × n_Fe(OH)₃` = 0.0028073 mol\n*   `V_total` = 100 cm³ = 0.1 L\n*   `M_acid` = 0.1 M\n\n**Test Option A: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n*   `V_acid` = 30.09 cm³ = 0.03009 L\n*   `[H⁺]_final` = 10⁻pH = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M ≈ 0.002042 M\n*   **LHS of equation:** `V_acid × M_acid` = 0.03009 L × 0.1 M = **0.003009 mol**\n*   **RHS of equation:** `(0.0028073 mol)` + `(0.002042 M × 0.1 L)` = 0.0028073 + 0.0002042 = **0.0030115 mol**\n\nThe values for the Left Hand Side (0.003009) and Right Hand Side (0.003012) are virtually identical. The tiny difference (<0.1%) is due to rounding in the problem's values. This option is internally consistent.\n\n**Test Option D: pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³**\n*   `V_acid` = 32.14 cm³ = 0.03214 L\n*   `[H⁺]_final` = 10⁻pH = 10⁻³.16 M ≈ 0.000692 M\n*   **LHS of equation:** `V_acid × M_acid` = 0.03214 L × 0.1 M = **0.003214 mol**\n*   **RHS of equation:** `(0.0028073 mol)` + `(0.000692 M × 0.1 L)` = 0.0028073 + 0.0000692 = **0.0028765 mol**\n\nThe values for LHS (0.003214) and RHS (0.002877) are significantly different. This option is not consistent.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly Option A provides a pair of pH and volume values that are consistent with the fundamental principles of stoichiometry and mole balance for this chemical system.\n\nYou can also use Python to quickly check the consistency for Option A.\n```python\n# Moles of H+ added based on the volume given in option A\nvolume_acid_L = 30.09 / 1000\nacid_molarity = 0.1\nmoles_H_added = volume_acid_L * acid_molarity\n\n# Moles of H+ needed based on reaction stoichiometry and the pH given in option A\nmolar_mass_feoh3 = 106.866\nmoles_feoh3 = 0.1 / molar_mass_feoh3\nmoles_H_reacted = 3 * moles_feoh3\n\nfinal_ph = 2.69\nfinal_H_conc = 10**(-final_ph)\ntotal_volume_L = 0.1\nmoles_H_final = final_H_conc * total_volume_L\n\ntotal_moles_H_needed = moles_H_reacted + moles_H_final\n\nprint(f\"Moles of H+ added (from volume): {moles_H_added:.6f}\")\nprint(f\"Total H+ needed (from pH & reaction): {total_moles_H_needed:.6f}\")\n# The two values are almost identical, confirming the consistency.\n```\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "To solve this problem, we need to perform two main calculations and check for their consistency:\n1.  **Stoichiometric Calculation:** Determine the amount of acid required to react with the given mass of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃.\n2.  **Mole Balance:** For a given answer choice, verify that the total amount of acid added equals the amount used in the reaction plus the amount left over to create the final pH.\n\n**Step 1: Stoichiometry of the Reaction**\n\nFirst, let's write down the chemical reaction. Iron(III) hydroxide is a solid base that dissolves by reacting with a strong acid (H⁺).\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nNext, we calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ to be dissolved.\n*   The molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ is: 55.845 (Fe) + 3 × (15.999 (O) + 1.008 (H)) ≈ 106.866 g/mol.\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 0.00093575 moles.\n\nFrom the balanced chemical equation, we see that 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ requires 3 moles of H⁺ to react completely.\n*   Moles of H⁺ required for reaction = 3 × 0.00093575 mol ≈ 0.0028073 moles.\n\nThe acid concentration is 0.1 M (0.1 mol/L). We can now find the *minimum* volume of acid needed just to dissolve the Fe(OH)₃, leaving no excess acid.\n*   Minimum Volume = Moles / Molarity = 0.0028073 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.028073 L\n*   Minimum Volume in cm³ = 0.028073 L × 1000 cm³/L ≈ **28.07 cm³**.\n\nThis is the volume of acid needed just for the reaction. Since all the options have an acidic pH (pH < 7), it means there must be an excess of acid added. Therefore, the volume of acid added must be **greater than 28.07 cm³**.\n\nLet's examine the options based on this finding:\n*   A) 30.09 cm³ (Possible)\n*   B) 20.40 cm³ (Impossible, not enough acid to dissolve the solid)\n*   C) 28.05 cm³ (Impossible, not enough acid to dissolve the solid)\n*   D) 32.14 cm³ (Possible)\n\nThis analysis eliminates options B and C.\n\n**Step 2: Mole Balance to Verify the Correct Option**\n\nNow we test the remaining options (A and D) for internal consistency. The total moles of H⁺ added from the acid must account for both the reaction and the remaining H⁺ in the final solution.\n\n**Total Moles H⁺ Added = Moles H⁺ Reacted + Moles H⁺ Remaining**\n`(Volume of Acid × Molarity of Acid) = (0.0028073) + (Final [H⁺] × Total Volume)`\n\nLet's test Option A: **pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n*   **Total Moles H⁺ Added:**\n    Volume = 30.09 cm³ = 0.03009 L\n    Moles added = 0.03009 L × 0.1 M = **0.003009 moles**.\n\n*   **Moles H⁺ Reacted + Moles H⁺ Remaining:**\n    Moles reacted = 0.0028073 moles.\n    Final [H⁺] = 10⁻ᵖᴴ = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M ≈ 0.002042 M.\n    Total final volume = 100 cm³ = 0.1 L.\n    Moles remaining = 0.002042 M × 0.1 L = 0.0002042 moles.\n    Sum = 0.0028073 + 0.0002042 = **0.0030115 moles**.\n\nThe \"moles added\" (0.003009) and the \"moles accounted for\" (0.0030115) are virtually identical. The small difference (<0.1%) is due to rounding in the problem's given values. This option is consistent.\n\nLet's test Option D for completeness: **pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³**\n*   **Total Moles H⁺ Added:**\n    Volume = 32.14 cm³ = 0.03214 L\n    Moles added = 0.03214 L × 0.1 M = **0.003214 moles**.\n\n*   **Moles H⁺ Reacted + Moles H⁺ Remaining:**\n    Moles reacted = 0.0028073 moles.\n    Final [H⁺] = 10⁻³.16 M ≈ 0.000692 M.\n    Total final volume = 0.1 L.\n    Moles remaining = 0.000692 M × 0.1 L = 0.0000692 moles.\n    Sum = 0.0028073 + 0.0000692 = **0.0028765 moles**.\n\nHere, the \"moles added\" (0.003214) does not match the \"moles accounted for\" (0.0028765). Thus, this option is incorrect.\n\nBased on the consistent stoichiometric and mole balance calculations, Option A is the only correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
