    "An optically active compound must be chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This typically means the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure is `CH3-CH2-C(CH3)=CHCl`. A molecule with a double bond is planar in the vicinity of the double bond. This entire molecule is essentially planar and therefore possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself). Molecules with a plane of symmetry are achiral and thus optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: This is a complex molecule, but the name provides the crucial information. The designations `(3aR,7aS)` specify the absolute configuration at two chiral centers. When a compound's name includes `(R)` or `(S)` designations, it refers to a specific enantiomer of a chiral molecule (unless it's a special case like a *meso* compound with pseudoasymmetric centers). This complex bicyclic structure is not symmetric, so it is not a *meso* compound. A specific enantiomer is, by definition, optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two chiral centers, C2 and C3. However, the molecule is symmetric, meaning the group on C2 (`-CH(CH3)COOH`) is the same as the group on C3 (`-CH(CH3)COOH`). We need to check if the `(2R,3S)` stereoisomer has an element of symmetry. Due to the opposite configurations at the two chiral centers in a symmetric molecule, this is a *meso* compound. A *meso* compound has a center of inversion or a plane of symmetry and is achiral, despite having chiral centers. Therefore, it is optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the compound above. The configurations at the two chiral centers are the same `(R,R)`. This stereoisomer lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule. Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` compound. Since the name specifies a single enantiomer, it is optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond and a hydroxyl group. Let's identify any chiral centers. Carbon C1, which bears the -OH group, is bonded to four different groups: 1) -OH, 2) -H, 3) the `-CH2-CH=` part of the ring, and 4) the `-CH2-CH2-CH=` part of the ring. Since the two paths around the ring from C1 are different, C1 is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral. The name `(R)-...` specifies a single enantiomer, which is optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This name refers to the stereoisomer where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all-cis). This molecule is highly symmetric. In its stable chair conformation (with all three OH groups in equatorial positions), it possesses a threefold axis of rotation (C3) and three planes of symmetry. Each plane of symmetry passes through one C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group. The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `(Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`. We need to search for chiral centers (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n    *   The carbon in the `-CH(CH3)2` group is bonded to a hydrogen, two identical methyl groups, and the rest of the molecule. It is not a chiral center.\n    *   None of the CH2 carbons are chiral.\n    *   In the cyclopentyl ring, the carbon attached to the carbonyl group is bonded to the `C=O` group and two identical `-CH2-` groups within the ring (the path `-CH2-CH2-` is the same in both directions). So, no carbon in the ring is a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers and no other elements of chirality. It is achiral and optically inactive.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds:\n-   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione** (Yes)\n-   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid** (Yes)\n-   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol** (Yes)\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds in the list.\n\n<<<D>>>"
