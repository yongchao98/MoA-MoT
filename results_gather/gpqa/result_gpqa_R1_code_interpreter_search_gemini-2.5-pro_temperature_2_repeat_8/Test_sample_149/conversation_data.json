    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting compound from its molecular formula and NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for DoU is `C - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 + 1`.\n    DoU = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    A DoU of 4 usually indicates a benzene ring. The remaining DoU of 1 suggests a double bond or another ring. The presence of an oxygen atom and a very downfield proton signal points towards a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern, a triplet (t), means it's coupled to an adjacent CH₂ group (according to the n+1 rule, 2 neighboring protons -> 2+1=3 peaks). This establishes a **-CH₂-CHO** fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the CH₂ group. Its chemical shift is consistent with a methylene group positioned between a benzene ring and an electron-withdrawing group like an aldehyde. The splitting, a doublet (d), confirms it is coupled to a single proton (the aldehyde proton, n+1 rule, 1 neighboring proton -> 1+1=2 peaks). This further confirms the **-CH₂-CHO** fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, both doublets and integrating to 2 protons each, are a classic pattern for a **para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring**. The chemical shifts are relatively upfield, suggesting the presence of a strong electron-donating group on the ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet corresponds to two exchangeable protons. Given the presence of nitrogen in the formula, this is an **amino group (-NH₂) **. An -NH₂ group is a strong electron-donating group, which explains the upfield position of the aromatic signals.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring with an -NH₂ group and a -CH₂-CHO group as substituents. The complete structure of the starting compound is **2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde**.\n\n     ![Starting Material: 2-(4-aminophenyl) acetaldehyde](https://i.imgur.com/kS9Q7x1.png)\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\nThe starting material, 2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **1. NaNO₂ + HCl (at 0-5 °C):** This set of reagents is used for the **diazotization** of a primary aromatic amine. The amino group (-NH₂) is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻).\n    The product after this step is 2-(4-diazoniumphenyl)acetaldehyde chloride.\n\n*   **2. H₂O:** The addition of water to the diazonium salt, often with gentle heating, leads to the hydrolysis of the diazonium group. The -N₂⁺ group is an excellent leaving group (it leaves as N₂ gas), and it is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group from the water.\n    The product after this step is **2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde**.\n\n     ![Intermediate: 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetaldehyde](https://i.imgur.com/gKj60lK.png)\n\n*   **3. aq. KOH, Heat:** This step involves treating the intermediate with a strong base (KOH) and heat. The intermediate, 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde, has an aldehyde group and acidic protons on the carbon alpha to the aldehyde (the α-carbon). These are the perfect conditions for an **Aldol Condensation**.\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) from KOH acts as a base and removes an acidic α-proton from one molecule to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate then attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde. This forms an aldol adduct, **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (which corresponds to option A).\n    *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The word \"Heat\" is crucial. It indicates that the reaction does not stop at the aldol adduct. The adduct readily dehydrates (loses a molecule of water) to form a more stable, conjugated system. The elimination involves the -OH group on the β-carbon (C3) and the acidic proton on the α-carbon (C2). This results in the formation of a double bond between the α and β carbons (a C=C double bond conjugated with the C=O bond of the aldehyde).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the final product.**\n\nThe dehydration of the aldol adduct (3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal) yields an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\nThe final structure is:\n`HO-C₆H₄-CH₂-CH=C(C₆H₄-OH)-CHO`\nLet's name this compound using IUPAC nomenclature:\n*   The principal functional group is the aldehyde (-CHO), so the suffix is \"-al\".\n*   The longest carbon chain containing the aldehyde and the double bond has four carbons, so it's a \"butenal\".\n*   The double bond is between C2 and C3, so it's a \"but-2-enal\".\n*   There are two 4-hydroxyphenyl substituents, one at position C2 and one at position C4.\n*   Thus, the final product name is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\nThis name and structure match option B.\n\n ![Final Product: 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl) but-2-enal](https://i.imgur.com/UEx8T1R.png)\n\n<<<B>>>"
