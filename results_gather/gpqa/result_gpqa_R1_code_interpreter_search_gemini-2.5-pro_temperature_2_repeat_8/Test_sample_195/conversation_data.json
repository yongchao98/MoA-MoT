    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Principle of Conservation of Energy:**\n    The core principle to solve this problem is the conservation of energy. In a relativistic system with a potential, the total conserved energy ($E_{conserved}$) is the sum of the relativistic energy of the particle ($E = \\gamma mc^2$) and its potential energy ($U(x)$). The term $E = \\gamma mc^2$ includes both the rest energy ($mc^2$) and the kinetic energy ($(\\gamma-1)mc^2$).\n    So, the conserved quantity is:\n    $E_{conserved} = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x)$\n    where:\n    *   $m$ is the rest mass of the particle.\n    *   $c$ is the speed of light.\n    *   $v$ is the speed of the particle.\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   $U(x)$ is the potential energy.\n\n2.  **Potential Energy of a Harmonic Oscillator:**\n    For a force given by Hooke's Law, $F = -kx$, the potential energy is:\n    $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n    So, our conservation of energy equation becomes:\n    $E_{conserved} = \\gamma mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n3.  **Evaluate Energy at Maximum Amplitude:**\n    The problem states that the maximum amplitude is $A$. At this point ($x=A$), the mass momentarily stops to reverse its direction. Therefore, its velocity is zero ($v=0$).\n    When $v=0$, the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n    The total energy at this point is:\n    $E_{conserved} = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n4.  **Evaluate Energy at the Equilibrium Position:**\n    The maximum speed ($v_{max}$) occurs when the mass passes through the equilibrium position ($x=0$). At this point, all the potential energy has been converted into kinetic energy.\n    At $x=0$, the potential energy is $U(0) = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$.\n    The speed is $v = v_{max}$, so the Lorentz factor is at its maximum value, $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n    The total energy at this point is:\n    $E_{conserved} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + 0 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n5.  **Equate the Energies and Solve for v_max:**\n    Since the total energy is conserved, the energy at the maximum amplitude must equal the energy at the equilibrium position.\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n    Now, we solve for $\\gamma_{max}$. Divide the entire equation by $mc^2$:\n    $1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\gamma_{max}$\n\n    Next, we substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$ to find $v_{max}$:\n    $1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n    To solve for $v_{max}$, let's first isolate the square root term by taking the reciprocal of both sides:\n    $\\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}}$\n\n    Now, square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n    $\\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2} = 1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$\n\n    Rearrange the equation to solve for $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n    Finally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n    $v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    This result matches option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>"
