    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the final product.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactant**\n\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down its structure to understand its components and calculate its initial IHD.\n\n*   **Cyclohex-3-ene**: This is a six-membered carbon ring containing one carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Carboxylic acid**: This is a -COOH group attached to the ring. It contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n*   **Formyl**: This is a -CHO group (an aldehyde) attached to the ring. It also contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n*   **Vinyl**: This is a -CH=CH2 group attached to the ring. It contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, can be calculated by summing up the contributions from rings and pi bonds in the molecule.\n*   One ring contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   Each double bond (C=C or C=O) contributes 1 to the IHD.\n\nFor the reactant:\n*   1 from the cyclohexane ring.\n*   1 from the C=C double bond within the ring (`-3-ene`).\n*   1 from the C=C double bond in the vinyl group.\n*   1 from the C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group.\n*   1 from the C=O double bond in the formyl group.\n\nTotal IHD of the reactant = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n\nLet's also determine its molecular formula.\n*   Ring carbons: 6\n*   Carboxylic acid carbon: 1\n*   Formyl group carbon: 1\n*   Vinyl group carbons: 2\n*   Total Carbons (C) = 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10.\nSo, the final product will also have 10 carbon atoms, as this reaction does not change the carbon skeleton.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\nThe reagent used is **red phosphorus (Red P) and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI)**. This combination is one of the most powerful reducing agents in organic chemistry. Its key function is to reduce almost all oxygen-containing functional groups and multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated hydrocarbon parts.\n\nThe following transformations will occur:\n*   **Reduction of double bonds**: All C=C double bonds will be saturated to C-C single bonds.\n    *   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring.\n    *   The `vinyl` group (-CH=CH2) becomes an `ethyl` group (-CH2-CH3).\n*   **Reduction of oxygen-containing groups**:\n    *   The `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) is reduced completely to a `methyl` group (-CH3).\n    *   The `formyl` group (-CHO) is reduced completely to a `methyl` group (-CH3).\n\n**3. Determine the Structure and IHD of the Product**\n\nThe reaction converts the initial molecule into a saturated hydrocarbon, while preserving the original carbon skeleton.\n\n*   The carbon skeleton is a six-membered ring with several side chains. After the reaction, this becomes a `cyclohexane` ring.\n*   All the functional groups and double bonds are reduced away, leaving only the saturated cyclohexane ring and saturated alkyl side chains (two methyl groups and one ethyl group).\n\nThe final product is a **substituted cyclohexane**. Structurally, it consists of a single ring and only single bonds. There are no double or triple bonds left.\n\nThe IHD of a molecule is calculated as:\nIHD = (number of rings) + (number of double bonds) + (2 Ã— number of triple bonds)\n\nFor the final product:\n*   Number of rings = 1 (the cyclohexane ring)\n*   Number of double bonds = 0\n*   Number of triple bonds = 0\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the product is:\nIHD = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1.\n\n**Alternative calculation using the molecular formula:**\n*   The product has 10 carbon atoms (C10).\n*   Since the product is a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon (a cycloalkane), its general formula is CnH2n.\n*   For n=10, the molecular formula of the product is C10H20.\n*   The IHD formula is IHD = C - H/2 + 1 (for a hydrocarbon).\n*   IHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1 = 10 - 10 + 1 = 1.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The index of hydrogen deficiency of the final product is 1.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) 3\nB) 1\nC) 0\nD) 5\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
