    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Determine the molecular formula and structure of the compound.**\n\nThe given compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\nLet's analyze the structure piece by piece to count the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms.\n*   **(CH3)2C=**: This group contains one central carbon and two methyl (CH3) groups. Total atoms: 3 Carbons, 6 Hydrogens.\n*   **=CH-**: This group has 1 Carbon and 1 Hydrogen.\n*   **-CH2-**: This group has 1 Carbon and 2 Hydrogens.\n*   **-CH(CH3)-**: This group has one carbon in the main chain with one hydrogen, and one methyl (CH3) branch. Total atoms: 2 Carbons, 4 Hydrogens.\n*   **-CH2-**: This group has 1 Carbon and 2 Hydrogens.\n*   **-CH=**: This group has 1 Carbon and 1 Hydrogen.\n*   **=C(CH3)2**: This group has one central carbon and two methyl groups. Total atoms: 3 Carbons, 6 Hydrogens.\n\nSumming up the atoms:\n*   Number of Carbon atoms (C) = 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12\n*   Number of Hydrogen atoms (H) = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22\n\nSo, the molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n**2. Count the number of each type of bond in the molecule.**\n\nTo count the bonds, let's visualize the connectivity:\nMe₂C=CH-CH₂-CH(Me)-CH₂-CH=CMe₂ (where Me = CH₃)\n\n*   **C-H bonds**: We sum the hydrogens from the molecular formula: 22 C-H bonds.\n*   **C=C bonds**: There are two double bonds indicated in the formula: (CH₃)₂C**=**CH... and ...CH**=**C(CH₃)₂. So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C bonds**: We can determine the number of C-C single bonds. For any acyclic molecule, the total number of bonds between carbon atoms (single, double, triple) is N_C - 1, where N_C is the number of carbon atoms.\n    *   Total carbon-carbon bonds = 12 - 1 = 11.\n    *   We know there are 2 C=C bonds.\n    *   Therefore, the number of C-C single bonds = 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n    Alternatively, we can count them directly from the structure:\n    *   Two C-CH₃ bonds in the initial (CH₃)₂C group.\n    *   One C-C bond between the first C=C group and the adjacent CH₂. (=CH-CH₂-).\n    *   One C-C bond between -CH₂- and -CH(CH₃)-.\n    *   One C-C bond within the -CH(CH₃)- group (to the methyl branch).\n    *   One C-C bond between -CH(CH₃)- and the next -CH₂-.\n    *   One C-C bond between -CH₂- and the final C=C group. (-CH₂-CH=).\n    *   Two C-CH₃ bonds in the final =C(CH₃)₂ group.\n    *   Total C-C bonds = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 9.\n\n**Summary of bonds:**\n*   C-H bonds: 22\n*   C-C bonds: 9\n*   C=C bonds: 2\n\n**3. Calculate the enthalpy of atomization of the compound (ΔHa, product).**\n\nThe enthalpy of atomization of the compound is the sum of the bond energies of all the bonds in one mole of the substance.\nΔH_a(C₁₂H₂₂) = (No. of C-H bonds × BE_C-H) + (No. of C-C bonds × BE_C-C) + (No. of C=C bonds × BE_C=C)\nUsing the given bond energies:\n*   BE(C-H) = 400 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C-C) = 200 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C=C) = 300 kJ/mol\n\nΔH_a(C₁₂H₂₂) = (22 × 400) + (9 × 200) + (2 × 300)\nΔH_a(C₁₂H₂₂) = 8800 + 1800 + 600\nΔH_a(C₁₂H₂₂) = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**4. Calculate the enthalpy of atomization of the reactants (ΔHa, reactants).**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°) is for the reaction:\n12C(s, graphite) + 11H₂(g) → C₁₂H₂₂(g)\n\nThe enthalpy of atomization of reactants involves converting 12 moles of solid carbon and 11 moles of hydrogen gas into gaseous atoms.\n*   12C(s) → 12C(g):  ΔH = 12 × ΔH_a(C)\n*   11H₂(g) → 22H(g):  ΔH = 11 × BE(H-H)\n\nUsing the given data:\n*   Enthalpy of atomization of carbon, ΔH_a(C) = 1000 kJ/mol\n*   Bond energy of H-H, BE(H-H) = 100 kJ/mol\n\nΔH_a(reactants) = (12 × 1000) + (11 × 100)\nΔH_a(reactants) = 12000 + 1100\nΔH_a(reactants) = **13100 kJ**\n\n**5. Calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°).**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy required to form the atoms from the elements in their standard state and the energy released when these atoms form the compound.\nΔHf° = ΔH_a(reactants) - ΔH_a(product)\nΔHf° = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol\nΔHf° = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**6. Compare the result with the given options.**\n\nThe calculated molar enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. Let's examine the options:\nA) 67.4 kJ/mol\nB) 11200 kJ/mol  (This is the enthalpy of atomization of the compound)\nC) 11.44 kJ/g\nD) 1900 kJ/g\n\nOur calculated value is 1900 kJ/mol. Option D has the correct number but incorrect units (kJ/g). Let's convert our answer to kJ/g to check against option C.\n\nFirst, calculate the molar mass of C₁₂H₂₂.\nMolar Mass = (12 × Atomic Mass of C) + (22 × Atomic Mass of H)\nMolar Mass ≈ (12 × 12) + (22 × 1) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n\nNow, convert the enthalpy of formation to kJ/g:\nΔHf° (kJ/g) = ΔHf° (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\nΔHf° (kJ/g) = 1900 kJ/mol / 166 g/mol ≈ **11.4457 kJ/g**\n\nThis value matches option C.\n\n```python\n# Script to verify calculations\n# Given data\nenthalpy_atomization_C = 1000  # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_HH = 100          # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_CC = 200          # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_C_dbl_C = 300     # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_CH = 400          # kJ/mol\n\n# Molecule: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2\n# Formula: C12H22\nnum_C = 12\nnum_H = 22\n\n# Bond counts\nnum_CH_bonds = 22\nnum_CC_bonds = 9\nnum_C_dbl_C_bonds = 2\n\n# Enthalpy of atomization of the compound (product)\nenthalpy_atomization_product = (num_CH_bonds * bond_energy_CH) + \\\n                               (num_CC_bonds * bond_energy_CC) + \\\n                               (num_C_dbl_C_bonds * bond_energy_C_dbl_C)\n\n# Enthalpy of atomization of elements (reactants)\n# Reaction: 12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) -> C12H22(g)\nnum_H2_moles = num_H / 2\nenthalpy_atomization_reactants = (num_C * enthalpy_atomization_C) + (num_H2_moles * bond_energy_HH)\n\n# Enthalpy of formation in kJ/mol\nenthalpy_of_formation_kj_mol = enthalpy_atomization_reactants - enthalpy_atomization_product\n\n# Molar mass of C12H22 (using integer masses as per typical problem conventions)\nmolar_mass = 12 * 12 + 22 * 1\n\n# Enthalpy of formation in kJ/g\nenthalpy_of_formation_kj_g = enthalpy_of_formation_kj_mol / molar_mass\n\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of formation (kJ/mol): {enthalpy_of_formation_kj_mol}\")\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of formation (kJ/g): {enthalpy_of_formation_kj_g}\")\n```\n>>>\nEnthalpy of formation (kJ/mol): 1900.0\nEnthalpy of formation (kJ/g): 11.44578313253012\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "An enthalpy of formation calculation involves a Hess's Law cycle using atomization energies. The overall process can be thought of in two main steps:\n1.  Breaking the reactants (elements in their standard state) into individual gaseous atoms.\n2.  Forming the product molecule from these gaseous atoms.\n\nThe enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) is the net energy change of this process.\nΔHf = (Enthalpy of atomization of reactants) - (Enthalpy of atomization of product)\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the molecule to find its formula and bond structure.**\nThe molecule is (CH₃)₂C=CH-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH=C(CH₃)₂.\nLet's count the atoms:\n*   Carbons (C): 2 (from (CH₃)₂) + 1 + 1 + 2 (from CH(CH₃)) + 1 + 1 + 2 (from (CH₃)₂) = 12 carbons.\n*   Hydrogens (H): 6 (from (CH₃)₂) + 1 + 2 + 4 (from CH(CH₃)) + 2 + 1 + 6 (from (CH₃)₂) = 22 hydrogens.\n*   The molecular formula is **C₁₂H₂₂**.\n\nNow, let's count the number of each type of bond:\n*   **C-H bonds**: The formula C₁₂H₂₂ tells us there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n*   **C=C bonds**: There are two double bonds indicated: (CH₃)₂**C=C**H- and -**C=C**(CH₃)₂. This gives **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C bonds**: For any acyclic molecule, the total number of carbon-carbon bonds is (Number of C atoms) - 1. Here, it is 12 - 1 = 11. Since 2 of these are double bonds, the number of single bonds is 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the enthalpy of atomization for the product (the molecule C₁₂H₂₂).**\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the molecule. It's the sum of all bond energies.\nΔHₐ(product) = (No. C-C bonds × BE_C-C) + (No. C=C bonds × BE_C=C) + (No. C-H bonds × BE_C-H)\nΔHₐ(product) = (9 × 200 kJ/mol) + (2 × 300 kJ/mol) + (22 × 400 kJ/mol)\nΔHₐ(product) = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the enthalpy of atomization for the reactants.**\nThe formation reaction is: 12C(graphite) + 11H₂(g) → C₁₂H₂₂(g)\nWe need to turn 12 moles of solid carbon and 11 moles of hydrogen gas into gaseous atoms.\nΔHₐ(reactants) = (12 × ΔHₐ(C)) + (11 × BE_H-H)\nΔHₐ(reactants) = (12 × 1000 kJ/mol) + (11 × 100 kJ/mol)\nΔHₐ(reactants) = 12000 + 1100 = **13100 kJ/mol**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔHf).**\nΔHf = ΔHₐ(reactants) - ΔHₐ(product)\nΔHf = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**Step 5: Check the units of the options.**\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. Options are given in kJ/mol and kJ/g. Let's convert our answer to kJ/g to see if it matches any option.\n*   Calculate the molar mass of C₁₂H₂₂:\n    Molar Mass = (12 × 12.01 g/mol) + (22 × 1.008 g/mol) ≈ 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol\n*   Convert ΔHf to kJ/g:\n    ΔHf (kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.44 kJ/g**\n\nThis value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
