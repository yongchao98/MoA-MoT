    "Detailed analysis of each statement:\n\nA) **Programmed ribosomal frameshifting creates two polyproteins near to 5` end of the genome by moving back by 1 nucleotide with the help of slippery nucleotides, and pseudoknot. The SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed ribosomal frameshifting.**\n*   **Analysis:** This statement accurately describes the -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF) mechanism in coronaviruses. This process occurs at the junction of ORF1a and ORF1b, located at the 5' end of the genome, to produce polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab. The mechanism involves a \"slippery sequence\" (U UUA AAC) and a downstream RNA pseudoknot. Studies comparing the frameshift-stimulating elements of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have found they are highly conserved and adopt nearly identical three-dimensional structures.\n*   **Verdict:** This statement is correct.\n\nB) **SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a has the ability to trigger caspase-8 activation/cleavage, without affecting the expression levels of Bcl-2. Caspase-8 activation is recognized as a characteristic feature of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway via death receptors, while Bcl-2 plays a crucial role in initiating the mitochondrial pathway. This suggests that the mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces apoptosis is via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.**\n*   **Analysis:** This statement correctly identifies the role of ORF3a in inducing apoptosis. Research has shown that ORF3a expression leads to the activation of caspase-8, a key initiator of the extrinsic (death receptor-mediated) apoptosis pathway. Concurrently, ORF3a does not significantly alter the levels of Bcl-2, an anti-apoptotic protein central to the intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway. This specificity points towards the extrinsic pathway as the primary mechanism for ORF3a-induced apoptosis.\n*   **Verdict:** This statement is correct.\n\nC) **The rate of frameshifting in vitro is linearly correlated with the number of conformations that a pseudoknot can adopt. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Programmed -1 Frameshift Signals show two conformations when under tension, similar to other pseudoknots that induce comparable frameshifting rates.**\n*   **Analysis:** This statement makes a claim about the correlation between frameshifting rate and the number of pseudoknot conformations. However, research, including studies using single-molecule force spectroscopy, indicates that a high frameshifting efficiency in coronaviruses is associated with the pseudoknot's ability to resist unfolding and maintain a *single*, stable conformation under tension. Pseudoknots from other viruses (like MMTV) that show multiple unfolding pathways or conformations under tension typically exhibit lower frameshifting efficiencies. The statement that the rate is \"linearly correlated with the number of conformations\" is incorrect; a stable, single conformation is key for high efficiency.\n*   **Verdict:** This statement is incorrect.\n\nD) **SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 could bind to nsp10 making an active exonuclease complex that prevents the breakdown of dsRNA.**\n*   **Analysis:** This statement correctly describes the viral proofreading mechanism. The non-structural protein nsp14 contains a 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease (ExoN) domain at its N-terminus. This domain requires another non-structural protein, nsp10, as a cofactor. Together, they form an active heterodimer (nsp14-nsp10). This complex performs proofreading by removing mismatched nucleotides during RNA synthesis, thus ensuring the fidelity of the viral genome. A key function is to protect the nascent RNA strand, preventing the activation of host dsRNA sensors which would otherwise trigger an immune response and degrade the viral RNA.\n*   **Verdict:** This statement is correct.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nStatement C is the only one that contains factually incorrect information regarding the biophysics of the frameshifting pseudoknot.\n\n<<<C>>>"
