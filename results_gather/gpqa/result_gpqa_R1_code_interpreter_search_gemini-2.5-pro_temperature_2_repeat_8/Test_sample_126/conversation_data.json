    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactant:**\n    The starting molecule is 5-butylnona-2,6-diene.\n    *   \"nona\" indicates a 9-carbon main chain.\n    *   \"2,6-diene\" indicates double bonds starting at carbon 2 and carbon 6. The double bonds are between C2-C3 and C6-C7.\n    *   \"5-butyl\" indicates a butyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃) is attached to carbon 5.\n\n    Let's draw the structure:\n    ```\n        CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃\n        |\n    ¹CH₃-²CH=³CH-⁴CH₂-⁵CH-⁶CH=⁷CH-⁸CH₂-⁹CH₃\n    ```\n    The molecular formula is C₁₃H₂₄.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction Type:**\n    The reactant is a diene, and the reaction condition is heating. This strongly suggests a pericyclic reaction. Let's examine the structure of the diene system. The double bonds are at positions 2 and 6. Let's count the atoms between and including the double bonds: C2=C3-C4-C5-C6=C7. This is a hexa-1,5-diene-type system (i.e., the two double bonds are separated by two single bonds). Heating a hexa-1,5-diene derivative typically induces a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement, known as the Cope rearrangement.\n\n3.  **Apply the Cope Rearrangement Mechanism:**\n    The Cope rearrangement involves a cyclic transition state where a sigma bond breaks and a new sigma bond forms, while the two pi bonds shift their positions.\n    Let's identify the bonds that change:\n    *   The sigma bond between the two allylic carbons breaks. The two double bonds are C2=C3 and C6=C7. The carbons allylic to these are C4 and C5, respectively. So, the **C4-C5 sigma bond breaks**.\n    *   A new sigma bond forms between the two terminal carbons of the 1,5-diene system. These are **C2 and C7**.\n    *   The pi bond at C2=C3 moves to **C3=C4**.\n    *   The pi bond at C6=C7 moves to **C5=C6**.\n\n4.  **Determine the Structure of the Product:**\n    Let's trace the connectivity of the atoms in the product molecule.\n    *   The original C4-C5 bond is broken, so the 9-carbon chain is cleaved into two pieces at that point, which are then reconnected via a new C2-C7 bond.\n    *   Let's consider the fragments and how they are reconnected. The new C2-C7 bond will be the central part of the new molecule.\n    *   On one side of this bond is the original C2 atom, which is attached to its original substituent (a methyl group, C1) and the rest of its allylic system, which has now rearranged to -C3(H)=C4(H₂). This fragment is a vinyl group (-CH=CH₂).\n    *   On the other side of the new C2-C7 bond is the original C7 atom, which is attached to its original substituent (an ethyl group, C8-C9) and the rest of its allylic system, which has rearranged to -C6(H)=C5(H)-(Butyl group).\n\n    Let's assemble the final structure based on these connections:\n    ```\n         H₂C=CH-        -CH=CH-CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃\n               |          /\n             -CH-  --  -CH-\n              |          |\n             CH₃        CH₂CH₃\n    ```\n    Let's draw this structure out linearly to make it easier to name:\n    `CH₂=CH-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₂CH₃)-CH=CH-CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃`\n\n5.  **Name the Product using IUPAC Nomenclature:**\n    To name this molecule, we need to find the longest continuous carbon chain that contains the maximum number of double bonds.\n    *   The longest chain starts from the leftmost CH₂= group and goes to the end of the butyl group. Let's count the carbons: 2 (from vinyl) + 1 (C with methyl) + 1 (C with ethyl) + 6 (from the rest of the chain including butyl). Total chain length = 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 10 carbons. So, the parent alkane is decane.\n    *   Since it has two double bonds, it is a **decadiene**.\n    *   We need to number the chain to give the double bonds the lowest possible locants. Numbering from the left end (the CH₂= group) gives the double bonds positions 1 and 5. Numbering from the right would give 5 and 9. So, we number from the left.\n        `¹CH₂=²CH-³CH(CH₃)-⁴CH(CH₂CH₃)-⁵CH=⁶CH-⁷CH₂-⁸CH₂-⁹CH₂-¹⁰CH₃`\n    *   The double bonds are at C1 and C5, so it is a **deca-1,5-diene**.\n    *   Now, identify and locate the substituents on this main chain.\n        *   There is a **methyl group** (-CH₃) on carbon **3**.\n        *   There is an **ethyl group** (-CH₂CH₃) on carbon **4**.\n    *   Assemble the full name, listing the substituents alphabetically: **4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene**.\n\n6.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    *   A) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene\n    *   B) 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene\n    *   C) 5-ethylundeca-2,6-diene\n    *   D) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene\n\n    Our derived name, **4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene**, matches option B perfectly.\n\nFinal check: The rearrangement is an isomerization. Let's check the molecular formula of the product. Deca (10C) + methyl (1C) + ethyl (2C) = 13 carbons. For a non-cyclic diene, the formula is CnH2n-2, so C₁₃H₂(₁₃)₋₂ = C₁₃H₂₄. This matches the reactant's formula, confirming it's a valid rearrangement product.\n\n<<<B>>>"
