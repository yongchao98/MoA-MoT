    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the given information about the compound:**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means it is a benzene ring (C6) with two substituents.\n    *   **Molecular Formula Hint:** It contains 8 carbon atoms in total. Since the benzene ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents must collectively contain 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):**\n        *   A carbonyl group (C=O) is present.\n        *   An aromatic-halogen bond is present. This is most reliably interpreted as a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly bonded to one of the carbons of the aromatic ring.\n\n2.  **Propose a molecular structure:**\n    *   Let the benzene ring be represented as C6H4 (since it's di-substituted).\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X), which contains 0 carbon atoms.\n    *   The other substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group.\n    *   Possible C2 groups containing a carbonyl are:\n        *   `-COCH3` (acetyl group). This would form a halo-acetophenone.\n        *   `-CH2CHO` (formylmethyl group). This would form a halo-phenylacetaldehyde.\n        *   `-CH2COOH` (carboxymethyl group). This would form a halo-phenylacetic acid.\n        *   `-COOCH3` (methyl ester group). This would form a methyl halo-benzoate.\n\n3.  **Predict the 1H NMR spectra for the most likely structures and compare with the given options.** The options B and D both show a pattern of two doublets (2H each) in the 7-8 ppm region. This is a classic signature for a **para (1,4) disubstituted** benzene ring, where the symmetry results in two sets of equivalent protons. We will therefore focus on para-substituted isomers.\n\n    *   **Candidate 1: para-haloacetophenone** (Structure: X-C6H4-COCH3)\n        *   **Total Protons:** The formula is C8H7XO. There should be 4 aromatic protons + 3 methyl protons = 7 protons.\n        *   **Expected 1H NMR:**\n            *   Two doublets in the aromatic region (e.g., ~7.4-8.0 ppm) for the 4 aromatic protons.\n            *   A singlet for the methyl group (-CH3). Since this methyl group is attached to a carbonyl, it is deshielded and should appear around **2.5-2.7 ppm**.\n        *   **Comparison with Option D:** `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)`.\n            *   This option matches the pattern (two doublets, one singlet) and the proton count (4+3=7).\n            *   However, the chemical shift of the singlet (2.3 ppm) is too low for an acetyl group's methyl protons (~2.6 ppm). This shift is more typical for a methyl group directly attached to the aromatic ring (a tolyl group). This makes Option D a poor match for this structure.\n\n    *   **Candidate 2: para-halophenylacetaldehyde** (Structure: X-C6H4-CH2CHO)\n        *   **Total Protons:** The formula is C8H7XO. There should be 4 aromatic protons + 2 methylene protons + 1 aldehyde proton = 7 protons.\n        *   **Expected 1H NMR:**\n            *   A signal for the aldehyde proton (-CHO). This is highly deshielded and should appear as a singlet or a triplet around **9-10 ppm**.\n            *   Two doublets for the 4 aromatic protons (~7.2-7.8 ppm).\n            *   A signal for the methylene protons (-CH2-). This group is adjacent to both an aromatic ring and a carbonyl, so it should appear around **3.6-3.8 ppm**. It would typically be a doublet due to coupling with the aldehyde proton.\n        *   **Comparison with Option B:** `9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)`.\n            *   **Proton Count:** 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 7 protons. This is incorrect, the sum is 7 protons. Let's recheck the option in the prompt. B) `9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)`. Ah, I see the integration error in my initial calculation, it should be 1+2+2+2 = 7H. Wait, let me recount the structure's protons: Ar(4H), CH2(2H), CHO(1H), total = 7H. The option integrations are 1H + 2H + 2H + 2H = 7H. OK, the proton count matches. Let's re-read the option. B) `1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)`. Wait, it's a `2H` singlet, that's incorrect for a CH2. It must be `3.7 (2H, s)`. Let me assume it is a typo in my reasoning, not the option. I will re-examine the option itself: B) `1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)`. Okay, a `2H singlet`. This makes sense for a `-CH2-` group with no adjacent protons.\n            *   The aldehyde proton signal at `9.9 ppm` is a perfect match.\n            *   The methylene proton signal at `3.7 ppm` is a perfect match.\n            *   The para-substituted aromatic pattern (two doublets) is present.\n            *   The structure `p-halophenylacetaldehyde` fits all the initial requirements (8C, di-substituted, C=O, Ar-X bond) and the chemical shifts in Option B are highly characteristic of it.\n            *   The only slight discrepancy is the multiplicity. We would expect coupling between the -CH2- and -CHO protons (a doublet and a triplet). However, it is common for this coupling to be absent or very small, resulting in two singlets, especially in idealized problems or under certain experimental conditions (e.g., exchange with trace acid/water).\n\n4.  **Evaluate other options:**\n    *   **A) & C):** These options lack signals in the typical aromatic region (7-8 ppm), which is inconsistent with having an aromatic ring. Therefore, they are incorrect.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Option D is a poor fit because the key methyl chemical shift is significantly different from the expected value for the only plausible structure.\n    *   Option B provides data where the chemical shifts of the characteristic aldehyde and methylene protons are an excellent match for the `para-halophenylacetaldehyde` structure. This structure, in turn, perfectly fits all the conditions described in the problem. The discrepancy in multiplicity is a plausible simplification.\n\nTherefore, Option B represents the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n<<<B>>>"
