    "This problem requires us to calculate the fraction of a specific cobalt complex, [Co(SCN)2], relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution. This fraction is known as the distribution coefficient, α2.\n\n**1. Identify the species and equilibria:**\n\nThe cobalt(II) ion (Co²⁺) reacts with thiocyanate ions (SCN⁻) to form a series of complexes. The reactions and their overall stability constants (βn) are:\n\n*   Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺  ; β₁ = [[Co(SCN)]⁺] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]) = 9\n*   Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂] ; β₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) = 40\n*   Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ ; β₃ = [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³) = 63\n*   Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻; β₄ = [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴) = 16\n\n**2. Define the total cobalt concentration:**\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of the free Co²⁺ ion and all its complexes:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\n**3. Express complex concentrations in terms of [Co²⁺]:**\n\nUsing the stability constant expressions from step 1, we can write the concentration of each complex in terms of the free Co²⁺ concentration and the free ligand concentration [SCN⁻]:\n*   [[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n*   [[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n*   [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n*   [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\n**4.

Plug in the given values and calculate:**\n\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M (Since the ligand concentration is in large excess compared to the metal ion concentration, c(Co) = 0.01 M, we can approximate the free ligand concentration as the total ligand concentration).\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nNow, let's calculate the terms in the denominator first, which we'll call D:\nD = 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.1²) + (63 * 0.1³) + (16 * 0.1⁴)\nD = 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.01) + (63 * 0.001) + (16 * 0.0001)\nD = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016\nD = 2.3646\n\nThe numerator is:\nNumerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n\nNow, calculate α₂:\nα₂ = Numerator / D = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo find the percentage, multiply by 100:\nPercentage = 0.16916 * 100 = 16.916%\n\nThis value is closest to 16.9%.\n\n```python\n# Given values\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nscn_conc = 0.1  # [SCN-] in M\n\n# The distribution coefficient alpha_n for a complex ML_n is given by:\n# alpha_n = (beta_n * [L]^n) / (1 + beta_1*[L]^1 + beta_2*[L]^2 + ... + beta_N*[L]^N)\n# We are looking for the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, [Co(SCN)2], which corresponds to n=2.\n\n# Calculate the denominator (the sum of all terms in the distribution function)\ndenominator = (1 +\n             beta1 * (scn_conc**1) +\n             beta2 * (scn_conc**2) +\n             beta3 * (scn_conc**3) +\n             beta4 * (scn_conc**4))\n\n# Calculate the numerator for the n=2 species\nnumerator_n2 = beta2 * (scn_conc**2)\n\n# Calculate the fraction (alpha_2)\nalpha_2 = numerator_n2 / denominator\n\n# Convert to percentage\npercentage = alpha_2 * 100\n\nprint(f\"{percentage:.1f}%\")\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], among all cobalt-containing species in the solution. This percentage is equivalent to the distribution coefficient (α₂) of this complex, multiplied by 100.\n\n**1. Understand the System**\n\nIn the solution, cobalt(II) ions (Co²⁺) react with thiocyanate ions (SCN⁻) to form a series of complexes. The total concentration of cobalt, denoted as c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of the free, uncomplexed Co²⁺ ion and all its thiocyanato complexes:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)]⁺ + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ + [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻\n\n**2. Use Stability Constants**\n\nThe formation of each complex is described by an overall stability constant (βₙ):\n*   [Co(SCN)]⁺ = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n*   [Co(SCN)₂] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n*   [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n*   [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\nWe can substitute these into the expression for the total cobalt concentration:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\nFactoring out [Co²⁺]:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**3. Formulate the Distribution Coefficient (α₂)**\n\nThe fraction of the dithiocyanato complex, α₂, is the ratio of its concentration to the total cobalt concentration:\nα₂ = [Co(SCN)₂] / c(Co)\n\nSubstitute the expressions for [Co(SCN)₂] and c(Co):\nα₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))\n\nThe [Co²⁺] term cancels out, leaving:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**4. Calculation**\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nCalculate the terms:\n*   Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n*   Denominator term 1: 1\n*   Denominator term 2: β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9\n*   Denominator term 3: β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4\n*   Denominator term 4: β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 0.063\n*   Denominator term 5: β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016\n\nSum of the denominator:\nDenominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nCalculate α₂:\nα₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n**5. Final Answer**\n\nTo get the percentage, multiply α₂ by 100:\nPercentage = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
