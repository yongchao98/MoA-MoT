    "Here's my thinking process to solve this problem.\n\n### 1. Understand the Goal\nThe main goal is to determine the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1 ($P_2/P_1$).\n\n### 2. Deconstruct the Provided Information\n-   **System 1 & 2:** Two star-planet systems.\n-   **Stars:** Identical masses ($M_{s1} = M_{s2}$). They are Sun-like.\n-   **Planets:** Similar masses ($m_{p1} \\approx m_{p2}$). They are Neptune-like. Given this is a physics problem with a single numerical answer, it's a standard assumption that \"similar\" implies we should treat them as equal ($m_{p1} = m_{p2}$).\n-   **Orbits:** Both are circular. This simplifies the orbital equations, as eccentricity is zero.\n-   **Detection Method:** Radial Velocity (RV) method. This method measures the Doppler shift of the star's light as it's tugged by the orbiting planet.\n-   **Data Point 1:** The maximum wavelength shift for star #1 is $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstrom (mÅ).\n-   **Data Point 2:** The maximum wavelength shift for star #2 is $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ mÅ.\n\n### 3. Relate Observational Data to Physical Quantities\nThe RV method is based on the Doppler effect. The formula for the non-relativistic Doppler shift is:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_{los}}{c} $$\nwhere:\n-   $\\Delta\\lambda$ is the observed wavelength shift.\n-   $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n-   $v_{los}$ is the line-of-sight velocity of the star.\n-   $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nThe problem gives the *periodic shift of up to...*, which represents the maximum wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$). This corresponds to the maximum line-of-sight velocity of the star, known as the radial velocity semi-amplitude, K.\n\nSo, we have:\n$ K_1 \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5 $ mÅ\n$ K_2 \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7 $ mÅ\n\nThe ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is:\n$$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5} $$\n\n### 4. Link Physical Quantities (K and P)\nNow I need the formula that connects the RV semi-amplitude (K) to the orbital period (P) and other system parameters. For a circular orbit, the formula is:\n$$ K = \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{ (M_s + m_p)^{2/3} } \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{P} \\right)^{1/3} $$\nwhere:\n-   $m_p$ is the planet's mass.\n-   $M_s$ is the star's mass.\n-   $i$ is the inclination of the orbit to the line of sight.\n-   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n-   $P$ is the orbital period.\n\nThe problem does not provide information about the orbital inclination ($i$). A standard assumption in such cases is that the systems are either viewed under the same inclination ($i_1 = i_2$) or that they are viewed edge-on ($\\sin i = 1$) for maximum signal. In either case, the $\\sin i$ term is the same for both systems and will cancel out in a ratio.\n\n### 5. Formulate the Ratio and Solve\nLet's write down the expression for K for each system:\n$ K_1 = \\frac{m_{p1} \\sin i_1}{ (M_{s1} + m_{p1})^{2/3} } \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{P_1} \\right)^{1/3} $\n$ K_2 = \\frac{m_{p2} \\sin i_2}{ (M_{s2} + m_{p2})^{2/3} } \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{P_2} \\right)^{1/3} $\n\nNow, let's use the given information to simplify the ratio $K_2/K_1$:\n-   $M_{s1} = M_{s2}$\n-   $m_{p1} = m_{p2}$ (our assumption)\n-   $\\sin i_1 = \\sin i_2$ (our assumption)\n-   $2\\pi G$ is a constant.\n\nMost terms cancel out:\n$$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{ \\left( 1/P_2 \\right)^{1/3} }{ \\left( 1/P_1 \\right)^{1/3} } = \\left( \\frac{P_1}{P_2} \\right)^{1/3} $$\n\nWe are looking for $P_2/P_1$. Let's rearrange the equation:\n$$ \\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \\left( \\frac{K_2}{K_1} \\right)^3 $$\n$$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left( \\frac{K_1}{K_2} \\right)^3 $$\n\n### 6. Substitute Values and Calculate\nWe already found the ratio of the semi-amplitudes:\n$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{7}{5} $, which means $ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{5}{7} $.\n\nNow, substitute this into our equation for the period ratio:\n$$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left( \\frac{5}{7} \\right)^3 = \\frac{5^3}{7^3} = \\frac{125}{343} $$\n\nTo compare with the given options, I'll calculate the decimal value of this fraction.\n\n```python\nprint((5/7)**3)\n```\n```output\n0.3644312674251108\n```\n\nThe calculated value is approximately 0.364. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understanding the Physics of the Radial Velocity (RV) Method**\n\nThe problem uses the Radial Velocity (RV) method to detect exoplanets. This method relies on the Doppler effect. An orbiting planet pulls on its host star, causing the star to \"wobble\". As the star moves towards and away from us, the light from the star is blueshifted and redshifted, respectively. This is observed as a periodic shift in the star's spectral lines.\n\nThe magnitude of the wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's velocity along our line of sight ($v_r$).\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c} $$\nwhere $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nThe maximum wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$) corresponds to the maximum line-of-sight velocity of the star. This maximum velocity is called the RV semi-amplitude, denoted as $K$.\nTherefore, we can establish a direct proportionality between the measured wavelength shift and the RV semi-amplitude:\n$$ K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max} $$\n\n### **2. Relating Observational Data to Physical Parameters**\n\nWe are given the maximum periodic wavelength shifts for the two systems:\n-   Planet #1: $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstrom (mÅ)\n-   Planet #2: $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstrom (mÅ)\n\nFrom this, we can find the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes ($K_1$ and $K_2$):\n$$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5} $$\n\n### **3. The Formula for RV Semi-amplitude**\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude ($K$) of the host star is given by the formula:\n$$ K = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{P} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{(M_s + m_p)^{2/3}} $$\nwhere:\n-   $P$ is the orbital period of the planet.\n-   $m_p$ is the mass of the planet.\n-   $M_s$ is the mass of the star.\n-   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n-   $i$ is the inclination of the orbit relative to our line of sight (i=90° for an edge-on orbit).\n\n### **4. Setting up the Ratio to Solve for the Periods**\n\nWe can write the equation for each of the two systems:\n-   System 1: $ K_1 = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{P_1} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_{p1} \\sin i_1}{(M_{s1} + m_{p1})^{2/3}} $\n-   System 2: $ K_2 = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{P_2} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_{p2} \\sin i_2}{(M_{s2} + m_{p2})^{2/3}} $\n\nNow, we form a ratio of $K_2$ to $K_1$:\n$$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{ \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{P_2} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_{p2} \\sin i_2}{(M_{s2} + m_{p2})^{2/3}} }{ \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{P_1} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_{p1} \\sin i_1}{(M_{s1} + m_{p1})^{2/3}} } $$\n\nWe use the information from the problem to simplify this ratio:\n-   The stars have the same mass: $M_{s1} = M_{s2}$.\n-   The planets have similar masses: we assume $m_{p1} = m_{p2}$.\n-   The term $2\\pi G$ is a constant and cancels out.\n-   The problem does not specify the inclination angle $i$. It's a standard assumption in these types of problems that the systems are being compared under similar conditions, meaning $i_1 = i_2$. Therefore, the $\\sin i$ term also cancels out.\n\nAfter cancelling the identical terms, the expression simplifies significantly:\n$$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{ \\left( 1/P_2 \\right)^{1/3} }{ \\left( 1/P_1 \\right)^{1/3} } = \\left( \\frac{P_1}{P_2} \\right)^{1/3} $$\n\n### **5. Calculating the Final Answer**\n\nThe question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to planet #1, which is $P_2 / P_1$. Let's rearrange our simplified equation to solve for this ratio.\n\nFirst, cube both sides:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{K_2}{K_1} \\right)^3 = \\frac{P_1}{P_2} $$\n\nThen, take the reciprocal of both sides:\n$$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left( \\frac{K_1}{K_2} \\right)^3 $$\n\nWe already established that $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{7}{5}$, so $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{5}{7}$. Substituting this value into our final equation:\n$$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left( \\frac{5}{7} \\right)^3 = \\frac{125}{343} $$\n\nCalculating the decimal value:\n$$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\approx 0.3644 $$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36. Comparing this result with the given options:\nA) ~ 0.85\nB) ~ 1.96\nC) ~ 1.40\nD) ~ 0.36\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
