    "*   **Step 1: Elucidate the structure of Compound X from the given spectral data.**\n\n    *   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   A very broad absorption from **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid dimer.\n        *   A strong, sharp peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** is indicative of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n        *   Peaks at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** are characteristic of C=C stretching in an aromatic ring.\n        *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet in this region (10-13 ppm) is a definitive signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This confirms the IR analysis.\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic fingerprint for a **para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring**. The protons at 8.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, causing them to be deshielded. The protons at 7.2 ppm are ortho to the other substituent, which must be an alkyl group (electron-donating).\n        *   **Analysis of the Alkyl Substituent (0.9 to 2.9 ppm):** Let's piece together the structure of the second substituent on the ring.\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This gives us a CH₃-CH₂... fragment.\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-). This gives us a ...CH(CH₃)... fragment.\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons corresponds to the -CH₂- group from our first fragment. It is a multiplet because it is coupled to both the methyl group (3H) and the methine group (1H).\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton corresponds to the methine group (-CH-). This proton is attached to the aromatic ring, the -CH₃ group (1.4 ppm), and the -CH₂- group (1.7 ppm), hence the complex multiplet signal.\n        *   **Assembling the alkyl group:** Connecting the fragments [CH₃-CH₂-] and [-CH(CH₃)-] via the CH₂ and CH groups gives the structure: CH₃-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-. This is a **sec-butyl** group.\n        *   **Conclusion from NMR:** The alkyl substituent is a sec-butyl group.\n\n    *   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the information, Compound X is a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group and a sec-butyl group in para positions. The structure is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches option (D).\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the product of the reaction.**\n\n    *   **Reagents:** Compound X is treated with **red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI)**.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This combination of reagents is a powerful reducing agent used for the complete reduction of carbonyl-containing functional groups, especially carboxylic acids and ketones, down to the corresponding alkane (methylene or methyl group).\n    *   **Transformation:** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) on the aromatic ring will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃). The aromatic ring and the sec-butyl group are stable under these conditions and will not be affected.\n        *   Reactant: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n        *   Product: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\n\n*   **Step 3: Match the product to the given options.**\n\n    *   The final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n    *   Let's check the options:\n        *   A) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene\n        *   B) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\n        *   C) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid\n        *   D) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (This is the starting material, Compound X)\n\n    *   The calculated product matches option (B).\n\n<<<B>>>"
