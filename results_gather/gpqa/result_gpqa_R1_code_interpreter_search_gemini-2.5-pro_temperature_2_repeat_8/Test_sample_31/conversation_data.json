    "To determine the total energy of the nucleus, we will use the principles of special relativity.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Nucleus and its Composition:**\n    *   The problem specifies the nucleus as Lithium (Li). From the periodic table, Lithium has an atomic number (Z) of 3, which means it has 3 protons.\n    *   The problem also states it has 3 neutrons (N).\n    *   The total number of nucleons (protons + neutrons) is A = Z + N = 3 + 3 = 6. The nucleus is therefore an isotope of Lithium, specifically Lithium-6 ($^{6}$Li).\n\n2.  **State the Relativistic Energy Formula:**\n    The total energy (E) of a particle moving at a relativistic speed is given by the equation:\n    E = γ * m₀c²\n    where:\n    *   `m₀` is the rest mass of the particle.\n    *   `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is calculated as `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    *   The speed of the nucleus is given as `v = 0.96c`.\n    *   The ratio `v/c` is 0.96.\n    *   We can now calculate γ:\n        γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.96²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / √0.0784 = 1 / 0.28\n        γ ≈ 3.5714\n\n4.  **Calculate the Rest Mass Energy (m₀c²):**\n    In physics problems of this type, the rest mass of a nucleus can be calculated in two ways:\n    a) Using the precise, experimentally determined mass of the nucleus, which accounts for the binding energy holding the nucleons together.\n    b) By summing the individual rest masses of its constituent protons and neutrons. This method ignores binding energy and is a common simplification.\n\n    Let's calculate the rest mass energy using method (b), as it often aligns with the intended solution in educational contexts. We'll use a Python script for a precise calculation.\n    *   Rest Mass Energy of a Proton ≈ 938.272 MeV\n    *   Rest Mass Energy of a Neutron ≈ 939.565 MeV\n\n    `m₀c²` for $^{6}$Li ≈ 3 × (proton mass-energy) + 3 × (neutron mass-energy)\n    `m₀c²` ≈ 3 × (938.272 MeV + 939.565 MeV) = 3 × 1877.837 MeV = 5633.511 MeV\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Energy (E):**\n    Now, we combine the Lorentz factor and the calculated rest mass energy.\n    E = γ * m₀c²\n    E ≈ 3.5714 * 5633.511 MeV ≈ 20119.7 MeV\n\n6.  **Convert to GeV and Select the Answer:**\n    *   Since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV, we convert our result:\n        E ≈ 20119.7 MeV / 1000 = 20.1197 GeV.\n    *   Comparing this value to the options provided:\n        A) 18.475 GeV\n        B) 20.132 GeV\n        C) 21.419 GeV\n        D) 23.069 GeV\n    *   Our calculated value of **20.120 GeV** is extremely close to option B, **20.132 GeV**. The minor discrepancy is likely due to the precise values of proton and neutron masses used by the source of the question.\n\nTo verify this with high-precision constants, we can use the following Python code.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Use standard high-precision values for particle masses in MeV/c^2\nmass_proton_MeV = 938.27208816\nmass_neutron_MeV = 939.56542052\n\n# Given problem values\nnum_protons = 3\nnum_neutrons = 3\nv_over_c = 0.96\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the rest mass energy (m0 * c^2) by summing constituent masses\n# This method ignores nuclear binding energy.\nm0_c2_sum_MeV = (num_protons * mass_proton_MeV) + (num_neutrons * mass_neutron_MeV)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v_over_c**2)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the total energy in MeV\nE_total_MeV_sum = gamma * m0_c2_sum_MeV\n\n# Step 4: Convert the total energy to GeV and print\nE_total_GeV_sum = E_total_MeV_sum / 1000\n\nprint(f\"{E_total_GeV_sum:.4f}\")\n```",
    "### Final Answer Formulation\n\nThe step-by-step reasoning has led to a consistent result. Here's a summary of the logical flow to arrive at the final answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Particle:** The nucleus is specified as Lithium (Li) with 3 protons and 3 neutrons, which identifies it as Lithium-6 ($^{6}$Li).\n\n2.  **Select the Physical Law:** The speed is relativistic (`v = 0.96c`), so the total energy must be calculated using the formula from special relativity:\n    *   `E_total = γ * m₀c²`\n    *   where the Lorentz factor `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    *   `v/c = 0.96`\n    *   `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.96²) = 1 / √(0.0784) = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.571428`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Rest Mass Energy (m₀c²):** The prompt does not provide the precise measured mass of the $^{6}$Li nucleus. A standard method for such problems is to calculate the rest mass energy by summing the rest masses of the constituent particles (3 protons and 3 neutrons). This approach ignores the nuclear binding energy.\n    *   Rest mass energy of a proton ≈ `938.272 MeV`\n    *   Rest mass energy of a neutron ≈ `939.565 MeV`\n    *   `m₀c²` of $^{6}$Li (constituents) = 3 × (`m_p c²` + `m_n c²`) = 3 × (938.272 + 939.565) MeV = `5633.511 MeV`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Energy:**\n    *   `E_total = γ * m₀c²`\n    *   `E_total ≈ 3.571428 * 5633.511 MeV ≈ 20119.7 MeV`\n\n6.  **Convert to Final Units and Compare:** The answers are in GeV.\n    *   `E_total ≈ 20119.7 MeV / 1000 = 20.1197 GeV`\n    *   This result was confirmed by the Python script execution (`20.1197`).\n    *   Comparing our calculated value to the given options:\n        *   A) 18.475 GeV\n        *   B) 20.132 GeV\n        *   C) 21.419 GeV\n        *   D) 23.069 GeV\n    *   The value `20.1197 GeV` is exceptionally close to option B, `20.132 GeV`. The small difference (about 0.06%) is easily explained by slight variations in the physical constants used.\n\nTherefore, B is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
