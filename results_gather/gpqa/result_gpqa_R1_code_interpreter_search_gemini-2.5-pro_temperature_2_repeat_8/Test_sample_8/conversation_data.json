    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry.\n\nA molecule belongs to the **C3h point group** if it possesses the following key symmetry elements:\n1.  A **C3 principal axis of rotation**: The molecule is indistinguishable after a rotation of 120 degrees around this axis.\n2.  A **horizontal mirror plane (σh)**: The molecule is indistinguishable after reflection through a plane that is perpendicular to the C3 principal axis.\nThe presence of these two elements implies the existence of an S3 improper rotation axis as well.\n\nLet's analyze each molecule:\n\n**A) triisopropyl borate, B(OCH(CH3)2)3**\n*   The central part of the molecule consists of a boron atom bonded to three oxygen atoms (BO3). This core is trigonal planar, and a C3 axis passes through the boron atom, perpendicular to the BO3 plane.\n*   However, each oxygen is attached to a bulky isopropyl group [-CH(CH3)2]. Due to steric hindrance (crowding) between these bulky groups, they will arrange themselves to be as far apart as possible. This is achieved by twisting out of the BO3 plane in a \"propeller-like\" fashion.\n*   This propeller conformation preserves the C3 axis but destroys the horizontal mirror plane (σh). Therefore, the most stable conformation of triisopropyl borate has **C3 symmetry**, not C3h. While a C3h conformation is theoretically possible, it would be very high in energy and is not the molecule's representative structure.\n\n**B) quinuclidine (1-Azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane)**\n*   This is a rigid, cage-like molecule.\n*   A C3 axis passes through the nitrogen (N) atom and the opposing bridgehead carbon-hydrogen (C-H) group.\n*   However, the molecule does not have a mirror plane perpendicular to this C3 axis. Reflecting through such a plane would require swapping the N atom with the CH group, which is not a symmetry operation as they are different.\n*   Instead, quinuclidine has three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis.\n*   A molecule with one C3 axis and three σv planes belongs to the **C3v point group**. So, this is not the correct answer.\n\n**C) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n*   This is the chemical name for **mellitic trianhydride (C12O9)**. The structure consists of a central benzene ring with three five-membered anhydride rings fused to its alternating sides (i.e., fused to the C1-C2, C3-C4, and C5-C6 bonds).\n*   The molecule is a large, conjugated system, which strongly favors a planar geometry.\n*   There is a C3 axis of rotation passing through the center of the benzene ring, perpendicular to the molecular plane. Rotating by 120° leaves the molecule unchanged.\n*   Because the molecule is planar, the plane of the molecule itself acts as a mirror plane. This plane is perpendicular to the C3 axis, so it is a **σh plane**.\n*   The molecule has both a C3 axis and a σh plane. It lacks other symmetry elements (like C2 axes perpendicular to C3 or vertical mirror planes) that would place it in a higher symmetry group (like D3h).\n*   Therefore, this molecule belongs to the **C3h point group**.\n\n**D) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n*   This molecule is analogous to C, but it's built on a larger triphenylene core instead of a benzene core. Triphenylene is a planar molecule made of four fused benzene rings.\n*   The three anhydride rings are fused to the outer \"bay regions\" of the triphenylene system.\n*   Like molecule C, if this molecule were planar, it would have C3h symmetry for the same reasons (a C3 axis and a σh plane).\n*   However, fusing groups onto the bay regions of large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons creates significant steric strain (in this case, between the anhydride groups and hydrogen atoms on adjacent rings). This strain is well-known to force the molecule to twist out of planarity, adopting a helical or propeller shape to relieve the crowding.\n*   This twisting would destroy the σh mirror plane. The molecule would likely retain its C3 axis, resulting in the **C3 point group**, similar to triisopropyl borate.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, molecule C (mellitic trianhydride) is the only one among the choices that is expected to have a stable structure belonging to the C3h point group.\n\n<<<C>>>"
