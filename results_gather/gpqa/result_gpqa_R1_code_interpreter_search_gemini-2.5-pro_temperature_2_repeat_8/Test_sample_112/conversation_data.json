    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Analysis of FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad peak in the 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ region is a hallmark of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the region for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When seen in conjunction with the broad O-H peak, it strongly supports the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the compound is unsaturated.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n### **2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the spectrum provides definitive proof of a C=C double bond, confirming the conclusion from the FTIR spectrum.\n\n**Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The compound contains a C=C double bond.\n\n### **3. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment. The mass of a carboxyl group (-COOH) is calculated as:\n    *   Mass of Carbon (C) = 12 amu\n    *   Mass of two Oxygens (O x 2) = 16 x 2 = 32 amu\n    *   Mass of Hydrogen (H) = 1 amu\n    *   **Total Mass = 12 + 32 + 1 = 45 amu**\n    *   The observation of a fragment at m/z = 45 is extremely strong evidence that the compound is a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from Mass Spectrometry:** The compound contains a -COOH group.\n\n### **4. Synthesis and Evaluation of Molecular Formulas**\n\nBased on the combined evidence, the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n\n*   **Identify the necessary atoms:**\n    *   A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options **A) C6H10O** and **C) C6H12O**, which only contain one oxygen atom.\n    *   We are left with **B) C6H12O2** and **D) C6H10O2**.\n\n*   **Use the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) to differentiate:**\n    *   The degree of unsaturation tells us the total number of rings and pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule.\n    *   The formula for DBE is: `DBE = C - (H/2) + 1` (for a formula containing only C, H, and O).\n    *   From our spectral analysis, we know the molecule contains at least **two** sources of unsaturation: one from the carbonyl (C=O) in the carboxylic acid and one from the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). Therefore, the correct formula must have a **DBE of at least 2**.\n\n*   **Calculate DBE for the remaining options:**\n    *   **B) C6H12O2:** DBE = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = **1**. This DBE value only accounts for the C=O in the carboxylic acid, implying the carbon chain is saturated. This contradicts the FTIR and NMR evidence for a C=C bond.\n    *   **D) C6H10O2:** DBE = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = **2**. This DBE value perfectly matches our findings: one degree of unsaturation for the C=O bond and a second for the C=C bond.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe formula C6H10O2 is the only one that fits all the spectral data: a six-carbon molecule containing a carboxylic acid group (2 oxygens, 1 DBE) and a C=C double bond (1 DBE), for a total of 2 degrees of unsaturation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
