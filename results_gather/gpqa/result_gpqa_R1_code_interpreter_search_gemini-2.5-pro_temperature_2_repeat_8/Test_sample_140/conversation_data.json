    "This problem involves a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction of an aryl halide (1-bromobenzene-2-d) with a very strong base (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia. This specific set of reactants points to an elimination-addition mechanism proceeding through a benzyne intermediate.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Reactants Analysis:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene molecule with a bromine atom at position 1 and its isotope, deuterium (d), at position 2. The positions ortho (adjacent) to the bromine are C2 and C6. C2 has a deuterium atom, and C6 has a hydrogen atom.\n    *   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is an extremely strong base, with the amide anion (:NH2-) being the active species. It is strong enough to deprotonate a benzene ring.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism: Elimination-Addition (Benzyne Mechanism)**\n\n    *   **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediate(s))**\n        The amide anion (NH2-) acts as a base and removes a proton from a position ortho to the leaving group (the bromine atom). In our starting material, there are two distinct ortho positions:\n        *   **Position C6:** Has a hydrogen atom (H).\n        *   **Position C2:** Has a deuterium atom (D).\n\n        The C-H bond is weaker and is broken more easily than the C-D bond (this is known as the primary kinetic isotope effect). Therefore, abstraction of the proton from C6 is faster than the abstraction of the deuteron from C2. However, since the question asks for all *possible* products, we must consider both elimination pathways.\n\n        *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton from C6. The resulting carbanion at C6 then expels the bromide ion from C1 to form a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom remains at C2. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n            ```\n            (Starting Material) --(H+ removal from C6)--> (Intermediate Carbanion) --(-Br-)--> 3-Deuterobenzyne\n            ```\n\n        *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. The resulting carbanion at C2 expels the bromide ion from C1 to form a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule. The resulting intermediate is the normal, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n            ```\n            (Starting Material) --(D+ removal from C2)--> (Intermediate Carbanion) --(-Br-)--> Benzyne\n            ```\n        So, two different benzyne intermediates are formed.\n\n    *   **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on Benzyne Intermediate(s))**\n        The amide anion (NH2-), which also acts as a nucleophile, attacks one of the two carbon atoms of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent, ammonia (NH3).\n\n        *   **Reaction of 3-Deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n            The triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium is at C2. The nucleophile NH2- can attack either C1 or C6. These two attacks are not equivalent and lead to different products.\n            1.  **Attack at C1:** The amino group (-NH2) attaches to C1, and a carbanion forms at C6. Protonation of C6 by NH3 gives a product where the -NH2 group is at C1 and the D is at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n            2.  **Attack at C6:** The amino group attaches to C6, and a carbanion forms at C1. Protonation of C1 by NH3 gives a product where the -NH2 group is at C6 and the D is at C2. If we renumber the ring to give the -NH2 group position 1, the deuterium atom is at position 3. This is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n            Thus, the 3-deuterobenzyne intermediate yields two distinct products.\n\n        *   **Reaction of Benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n            This is the standard, non-deuterated benzyne with a triple bond between C1 and C2. Attack by NH2- can occur at C1 or C2. Since the intermediate is symmetrical, both attacks lead to the same carbanion, which upon protonation yields a single product: **aniline** (with no deuterium).\n\n3.  **Summary of Possible Products:**\n    By considering all possible pathways, we have identified three unique organic products:\n    1.  2-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n    2.  3-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n    3.  Aniline (from Pathway B)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<B>>>"
