    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**1. Analyze the Problem Statement**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** The two compounds in the mixture share the molecular formula C10H14.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** The compounds are present in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two singlets with an integral ratio of 1:1.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three singlets with an integral ratio of 2:1:1.\n\n**2. Evaluate Each Potential Compound**\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four given options. We need to analyze their structures for chemical equivalence of protons, which is determined by symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H4(C2H5)2 = C6H4(C4H10) = C10H14. (Correct formula).\n    *   **Symmetry:** High symmetry (D2h).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are all chemically equivalent. This would produce **one singlet** (4H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. However, within an ethyl group, the -CH2- and -CH3 protons are different and they split each other. We would expect a quartet (-CH2-) and a triplet (-CH3-), not singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is incorrect because the problem states the aliphatic signals are *all singlets*. We can eliminate any answer choice containing it (Option D).\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Correct formula).\n    *   **Symmetry:** High symmetry (D2h). The molecule has two perpendicular mirror planes.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent. This produces **one singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. This produces **one singlet** integrating to 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Correct formula).\n    *   **Symmetry:** It has a mirror plane that bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are chemically equivalent. This produces **one singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent (a pair). The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent (a second pair). This produces **two singlets**, each integrating to 6H (a 1:1 ratio between them).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Correct formula).\n    *   **Symmetry:** Experimental data shows this molecule does not behave as if it's perfectly symmetrical on the NMR timescale, likely due to steric hindrance preventing free rotation of the methyl groups.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C4 and C6) are in different chemical environments. This produces **two distinct singlets**, each integrating to 1H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups fall into three distinct environments, producing **three singlets** with integrations of 6H, 3H, and 3H (a 2:1:1 ratio).\n    *   **Conclusion:** A single molecule of this compound would produce two aromatic signals. The problem states the *mixture* produces two aromatic signals. If this compound were part of the mixture, it would likely result in more than two aromatic signals in total, or a ratio other than 1:1. Therefore, it's unlikely to be in the mixture.\n\n**3. Test the Options by Combining the Spectra**\n\nBased on the analysis above, we are looking for a combination of two compounds that each contribute *one* aromatic singlet. This rules out 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, and thus options A, B, and D. Option C is the only remaining possibility. Let's confirm it's correct.\n\n**Test Option C: A 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.**\n\n*   **Aromatic Signals:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one singlet for 2H.\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene provides one singlet for 2H.\n    *   Since they are different molecules, their singlets will have slightly different chemical shifts. The result is **two singlets**.\n    *   Because the mixture is 1:1 and both signals represent 2H, their integral ratio will be **1:1**.\n    *   This perfectly matches the problem description.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Signals:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides **one singlet** for 12H.\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene provides **two singlets**, each for 6H.\n    *   The combined spectrum will therefore have a total of **three singlets**.\n    *   The integrals of these three singlets will be 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   The ratio of these integrals is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   This also perfectly matches the problem description.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only pair that perfectly reproduces the described 1H NMR spectrum for a 1:1 mixture.\n\n<<<C>>>"
