    "*   **Understanding the Concepts**\n    1.  **Uniform Distribution:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. This means the number of stars per unit volume is constant throughout space. Let's call this constant density `ρ`.\n    2.  **Parallax (plx):** Parallax is an angle that is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) of a star. The relationship is `d = 1/plx`. For simplicity, we can ignore the constants that depend on the units used (like parsecs and arcseconds) as we are interested in the proportionality.\n    3.  **The Goal:** We need to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. This can be written as `dN/d(plx)`, where `N` is the number of stars.\n\n*   **Step-by-Step Derivation**\n    1.  **Number of stars in a volume:** Let's consider a thin spherical shell of space at a distance `d` from Earth with a small thickness `dd`.\n    2.  The volume of this shell (`dV`) is approximately its surface area multiplied by its thickness:\n        `dV = (Area of sphere) * (thickness) = 4 * π * d² * dd`\n    3.  The number of stars (`dN`) in this thin shell is the density (`ρ`) multiplied by the volume of the shell (`dV`):\n        `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4 * π * d² * dd`\n    4.  **Express in terms of parallax:** Now we need to switch from the variable `d` to `plx`. We use the relationship `d = 1/plx`.\n    5.  We also need to find the relationship between the small thickness `dd` and a small range of parallax `d(plx)`. We can do this by taking the derivative of `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `d(d)/d(plx) = d/d(plx) (1/plx) = -1/plx²`\n        This gives us `dd = (-1/plx²) * d(plx)`. The negative sign just means that as distance (`d`) increases, parallax (`plx`) decreases. Since we are interested in the number of stars in a given range (a magnitude), we can ignore the negative sign.\n        `dd = (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n    6.  **Substitute back into the equation for dN:** Now we substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` in terms of `plx` back into our equation for `dN`:\n        `dN = ρ * 4 * π * d² * dd`\n        `dN = ρ * 4 * π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n        `dN = ρ * 4 * π * (1/plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n    7.  **Find the number per unit parallax:** The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is `dN/d(plx)`. We can find this by dividing our equation by `d(plx)`:\n        `dN / d(plx) = ρ * 4 * π * (1/plx⁴)`\n    8.  **Conclusion:** Since `ρ`, `4`, and `π` are all constants, we can see the relationship:\n        `dN / d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThe number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
