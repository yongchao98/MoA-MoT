    "This problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and its effect on particle decay.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics of Particle Decay**\n\nThe number of particles, N, that survive after a time 't' from an initial population N₀ is given by the exponential decay law:\nN(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / T)\n\nWhere:\n*   N₀ is the initial number of particles.\n*   N is the number of particles remaining after time t.\n*   T is the mean lifetime of the particle **in the laboratory frame**.\n\n**2. Incorporate Time Dilation**\n\nThe lifetime of a moving particle is dilated (lengthened) in the laboratory's frame of reference compared to its lifetime in its own rest frame (its proper lifetime, τ). This relationship is governed by the Lorentz factor, γ:\nT = γ * τ\n\nSubstituting this into the decay equation gives:\nN(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / (γ * τ))\n\n**3. Define the Time of Flight**\n\nThe particles are created at the center of the detector and must travel a distance R (the radius of the detector) to be detected. Since they are ultra-relativistic, their speed 'v' is approximately the speed of light 'c'. The time of flight 't' in the laboratory frame is:\nt ≈ R / c\n\n**4. Combine the Equations**\n\nNow, we can substitute the time of flight into our decay equation to find the fraction of particles (N/N₀) that reach the detector wall:\nN/N₀ = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ))\n\nLet's group the constants together. The detector radius R, the speed of light c, and the particle's proper lifetime τ are all constants. Let's define a single constant `k = R / (c * τ)`. The equation simplifies to:\nN/N₀ = exp(-k / γ)\n\n**5. Use the Given Information to Solve**\n\nWe are given two conditions:\n\n*   **Condition 1:** When the Lorentz factor (γ₁) is 20, one-third (1/3) of the particles reach the detector.\n    1/3 = exp(-k / 20)\n\n*   **Condition 2:** We need to find the new Lorentz factor (γ₂) for which two-thirds (2/3) of the particles reach the detector.\n    2/3 = exp(-k / γ₂)\n\n**Step 1: Find the constant 'k' from Condition 1.**\nTake the natural logarithm of both sides of the equation for Condition 1:\nln(1/3) = -k / 20\n-ln(3) = -k / 20\nk = 20 * ln(3)\n\n**Step 2: Use 'k' to find γ₂ from Condition 2.**\nTake the natural logarithm of both sides of the equation for Condition 2:\nln(2/3) = -k / γ₂\nγ₂ = -k / ln(2/3)\n\nNow substitute the expression for k we found in Step 1:\nγ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / ln(2/3)\nγ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / (ln(2) - ln(3))\nγ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / (ln(3) - ln(2))\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the numerical value.**\nTo get a precise value for γ₂, we can use a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Using the derived formula: gamma_2 = (20 * ln(3)) / (ln(3) - ln(2))\ngamma_2 = (20 * math.log(3)) / (math.log(3) - math.log(2))\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\n```output\n54.19420074122822\n```\nThe calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 54\nB) 40\nC) 28\nD) 68\n\nThe value 54.2 is closest to 54.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n1.  **Particle Decay Law:** The fraction of particles (`N/N₀`) that survive after a time `t` is given by the exponential decay formula:\n    `N/N₀ = exp(-t / T)`\n    where `T` is the mean lifetime of the particle in the reference frame where the time `t` is measured (the lab frame).\n\n2.  **Time Dilation:** From the theory of special relativity, the lifetime of a particle moving at a relativistic speed is dilated (appears longer) in the lab frame (`T`) compared to its lifetime in its own rest frame (the proper lifetime, `τ`). This relationship is defined by the Lorentz factor (`γ`):\n    `T = γ * τ`\n\n3.  **Combining the Equations:** Substituting the time-dilated lifetime into the decay law, we get:\n    `N/N₀ = exp(-t / (γ * τ))`\n\n4.  **Time of Flight:** The particles travel from the center of the spherical detector to the inner wall, a distance equal to the radius `R`. Since they are moving at ultra-relativistic velocities, their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. The time of flight `t` in the lab frame is:\n    `t ≈ R / c`\n\n5.  **Complete Formula:** Now we can substitute the time of flight into our combined decay equation:\n    `N/N₀ = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ))`\n    We can simplify this by grouping the constant terms. Let the constant `k = (R / (c * τ))`. This term depends on the detector size and the intrinsic properties of the particle, which do not change between the two scenarios. The formula becomes:\n    `N/N₀ = exp(-k / γ)`\n\n6.  **Using the Given Scenarios:** We have two scenarios from the problem statement:\n    *   **Scenario 1:** When `γ₁ = 20`, one-third of the particles survive (`N/N₀ = 1/3`).\n        `1/3 = exp(-k / 20)`\n    *   **Scenario 2:** We want to find the Lorentz factor `γ₂` for which two-thirds of the particles survive (`N/N₀ = 2/3`).\n        `2/3 = exp(-k / γ₂)`\n\n7.  **Solving for γ₂:**\n    First, let's solve for the constant `k` using the information from Scenario 1. We take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = -k / 20`\n    `-ln(3) = -k / 20`\n    `k = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n    Next, we use this expression for `k` in the equation for Scenario 2. Again, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(2/3) = -k / γ₂`\n    `γ₂ = -k / ln(2/3)`\n\n    Now, substitute the value of `k` we found:\n    `γ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / ln(2/3)`\n    Using the logarithm property `ln(a/b) = ln(a) - ln(b)`, this becomes:\n    `γ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / (ln(2) - ln(3))`\n    `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n\n8.  **Calculation:**\n    Using the values `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(2) ≈ 0.6931`:\n    `γ₂ = (20 * 1.0986) / (1.0986 - 0.6931)`\n    `γ₂ = 21.972 / 0.4055`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\nThe calculated value of `γ₂` is approximately 54.2. Looking at the options provided, the closest value is 54.\n\n<<<A>>>"
