    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the reaction and the question.**\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a series of substituted benzene rings. The question asks to arrange these substances in order of increasing yield of the para-monobromo derivative. The weight fraction of a product is directly proportional to its molar yield percentage, as all monobromo-isomers (ortho, meta, para) of a given substance have the same molar mass. Therefore, we need to rank the substances by increasing molar percentage of the para-isomer.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the substituents.**\nWe need to classify each substituent based on its directing effect in electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n*   **Ortho-, para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the ortho and para positions. These will produce a significant amount of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) -CH3 (Toluene)\n    *   5) -C2H5 (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) -Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They produce very little para-isomer.\n    *   4) -NO2 (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) -COOH (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) -COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate)\n\nThis classification immediately tells us that substances 4, 6, and 2 will have the lowest para-isomer yields, while substances 1, 5, and 3 will have the highest yields.\n\n**Step 3: Rank the meta-directing substances.**\nThe substances 4 (-NO2), 6 (-COOH), and 2 (-COOC2H5) are all deactivating, meta-directing groups. The yield of the minor para-isomer is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is a stronger meta-director, meaning it will produce an even smaller percentage of the ortho and para products.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength is:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n(Nitro is one of the strongest deactivators, followed by carboxylic acid, and then the ester, which is slightly less deactivating than the acid).\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of the deactivating strength:\n-NO2 < -COOH < -COOC2H5\nThis corresponds to the substance numbers:\n**4 < 6 < 2**\n\n**Step 4: Rank the ortho-, para-directing substances.**\nThe substances 1 (-CH3), 5 (-C2H5), and 3 (-Cl) are all ortho-, para-directors. We need to compare the percentage of para-isomer formed for each. This depends on a balance of electronic and steric effects.\n\n*   **-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** Halogens, while being deactivating overall, are known to give a very high yield of the para-isomer in electrophilic substitutions. This is due to a combination of their small size not providing much steric hindrance and electronic factors that favor para substitution. For bromination, chlorobenzene yields approximately 88% para-isomer, which is the highest among this group.\n*   **-CH3 (Toluene) vs. -C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The primary factor that determines the ratio of para to ortho product is steric hindrance. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased bulk provides more steric hindrance at the adjacent ortho positions, making it harder for the electrophile (Br+) to attack there. Consequently, attack at the unhindered para position is more favored for ethylbenzene than for toluene. This means ethylbenzene will have a higher para/ortho ratio and thus a higher overall percentage of the para-isomer compared to toluene.\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para-yield is: Toluene < Ethylbenzene.\n\nCombining these findings, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for the ortho-, para-directors is:\nToluene (-CH3) < Ethylbenzene (-C2H5) < Chlorobenzene (-Cl)\nThis corresponds to the substance numbers:\n**1 < 5 < 3**\n\n**Step 5: Combine the rankings.**\nNow, we combine the two groups. The meta-directors have lower para-yields than the ortho-, para-directors.\nCombined Order = (Rank of meta-directors) < (Rank of ortho-, para-directors)\nCombined Order = (4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe final complete order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
