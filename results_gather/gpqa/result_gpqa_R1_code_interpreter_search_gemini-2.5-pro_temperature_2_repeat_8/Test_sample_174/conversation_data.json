    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the source of radiation:** The problem describes an \"oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis)\". Any localized oscillating charge distribution will radiate electromagnetic waves. The radiation can be described by a multipole expansion. The dominant term in this expansion is typically the electric dipole radiation, followed by magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole radiation, and so on.\n\n2.  **Choose the appropriate physical model:**\n    *   **Electric Dipole Model:** This is the lowest-order and usually dominant form of radiation. It arises when there is an oscillating net electric dipole moment. An oscillation of charge along the z-axis within the spheroid creates such a dipole moment (`p(t) = p_0 \\hat{z} cos(ωt)`). This is the most common and fundamental type of radiation from a compact source.\n    *   **Electric Quadrupole Model:** This would be the dominant radiation mechanism if the oscillating dipole moment is zero by symmetry. This could happen, for example, if the spheroid itself deforms (e.g., oscillates between being prolate and oblate) in a way that the center of charge doesn't move.\n\n    Without any information that the dipole moment is zero, we should assume the most general case where it is not zero. In this scenario, the electric dipole radiation will be the dominant term. So, we will model the source as an oscillating electric dipole along the z-axis.\n\n3.  **Analyze the angular dependence of power (Electric Dipole Model):**\n    The time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle `(dP/dΩ)` for an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis is given by:\n    `dP/dΩ = C * sin^2(θ)`\n    where `C` is a constant that depends on the dipole moment amplitude, frequency, and fundamental constants, and `θ` is the angle with respect to the z-axis.\n\n4.  **Find the maximum power and the fraction at 30°:**\n    *   The radiated power `dP/dΩ` is maximum when `sin^2(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin^2(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (the equatorial plane).\n    *   The problem states that this maximum power is `A`. So, `A = C * sin^2(90°) = C * 1 = C`.\n    *   Therefore, the power distribution can be written as `dP/dΩ = A * sin^2(θ)`.\n    *   We need to find the power radiated at `θ = 30°`.\n        `(dP/dΩ)_30° = A * sin^2(30°)`\n    *   Since `sin(30°) = 1/2`, we have `sin^2(30°) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4`.\n    *   So, `(dP/dΩ)_30° = A * (1/4) = A/4`.\n    *   The fraction of the maximum power `A` radiated at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n\n5.  **Analyze the wavelength dependence of power (Electric Dipole Model):**\n    *   The radiated power `dP/dΩ` (and thus the maximum power `A`) for an electric dipole is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency `ω`.\n        `A ∝ ω^4`\n    *   The relationship between angular frequency `ω` and wavelength `λ` is `ω = 2πf = 2π(c/λ)`, where `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   Substituting this into the proportionality, we get:\n        `A ∝ (1/λ)^4 = λ^(-4)`\n    *   So, a possible form for the wavelength dependence of the function `f(λ, θ)` is **λ⁻⁴**.\n\n6.  **Combine the results:**\n    *   The fraction of maximum power at `θ = 30°` is 1/4.\n    *   A possible form of the wavelength dependence is `λ⁻⁴`.\n    *   This corresponds to option D.\n\n(For completeness, note that if we had assumed a pure electric quadrupole model, the power distribution would be `dP/dΩ ∝ sin^2(θ)cos^2(θ)`, the fraction would be 3/4, and the wavelength dependence would be `λ⁻⁶`, corresponding to option A. However, the dipole model is the more standard and general assumption.)\n\nFinal Answer Determination:\n-   Fraction at 30°: **1/4**\n-   Wavelength dependence: **λ⁻⁴**\n\nThese two results match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
