    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon, and the mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula: `(mass of H) / (total mass of molecule)`.\n*   Let's consider the general formula for saturated hydrocarbons.\n    *   For an alkane, CnH2n+2: Mass % H = `(2n + 2) * 1 / (12n + 2n + 2)` = `(2n + 2) / (14n + 2)`. Setting this to 0.1428 (or 1/7) does not yield an integer solution for n.\n    *   For a cycloalkane, CnH2n: Mass % H = `(2n) * 1 / (12n + 2n)` = `2n / 14n` = `2/14` = `1/7`.\n*   1/7 is approximately 0.142857, which matches the given 14.28%. Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane with the general formula CnH2n.\n*   The problem states that Z is widely used as a solvent. Common cycloalkane solvents are cyclopentane (C5H10) and cyclohexane (C6H12).\n*   The entire reaction chemistry described points towards a six-carbon ring system (as will be shown below), making **cyclohexane (C6H12)** the most logical identity for Z.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the components of mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, C and D.\n*   Y does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic. Benzene (aromatic) and saturated cycloalkanes do not react with bromine water under these conditions.\n*   Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n*   Z (cyclohexane) is itself a constituent of mixture Y. Let's say **D = Z = cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n*   The other component, C, must also be hydrogenated to Z (cyclohexane).\n*   The reaction that forms Y from X is a disproportionation over heated platinum. For a C6-ring system, this type of reaction typically involves dehydrogenation to form the stable aromatic compound, benzene, and hydrogenation of other molecules.\n*   Let's propose that the other component C is **benzene (C6H6)**.\n*   Let's check if Y = {benzene, cyclohexane} fits the criteria:\n    *   **Equimolar mixture of two liquids:** Benzene and cyclohexane are liquids and can form an equimolar mixture. Correct.\n    *   **Does not decolorize bromine water:** Correct.\n    *   **Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z:** Hydrogenation of benzene gives cyclohexane. Hydrogenation of cyclohexane gives cyclohexane. So, the mixture hydrogenates to give only cyclohexane (Z). Correct.\n    *   **Z is a constituent of Y:** Correct, cyclohexane is in the mixture.\n*   So, we conclude that **Y is an equimolar mixture of benzene (C6H6) and cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the components of mixture X**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B.\n*   X decolorizes bromine water, so A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds).\n*   The reaction X → Y is a disproportionation that produces an equimolar mixture of benzene and cyclohexane.\n    `A + B → C6H6 + C6H12`\n    (starting with 1 mole of A and 1 mole of B gives 1 mole of benzene and 1 mole of cyclohexane).\n*   By conservation of atoms, the total formula of A + B must be `C12H18`.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means both A and B must have a six-carbon skeleton that can be hydrogenated to a cyclohexane ring. Therefore, A and B are C6 compounds.\n*   Since A and B are C6 compounds and their combined formula is C12H18, they must have formulas C6Hx and C6Hy, where `x + y = 18`.\n*   A and B are unsaturated C6-ring compounds (isomers of cyclohexene or cyclohexadiene).\n    *   Cyclohexane (saturated) is C6H12.\n    *   Cyclohexene (one C=C bond) is C6H10.\n    *   Cyclohexadiene (two C=C bonds) is C6H8.\n*   We need to find two of these formulas whose hydrogen counts sum to 18. The only possible combination is 10 and 8.\n    *   Thus, one component of X is **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and the other is **cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n*   This combination makes sense in the disproportionation reaction:\n    `C6H8 (cyclohexadiene) → C6H6 (benzene) + 2H` (oxidation)\n    `C6H10 (cyclohexene) + 2H → C6H12 (cyclohexane)` (reduction)\n    This is a balanced hydrogen transfer between the two components of mixture X.\n*   Finally, the problem states that there are **no conjugated multiple bonds** in the compounds of mixture X.\n    *   Cyclohexene has only one double bond, so no conjugation.\n    *   For cyclohexadiene (C6H8), there are two isomers: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated).\n    *   Therefore, the specific diene must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene**.\n*   So, **X is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total number of hydrogen atoms**\n\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each liquid.\n*   Liquid 1: Cyclohexene (C6H10) has **10 hydrogen atoms**.\n*   Liquid 2: 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) has **8 hydrogen atoms**.\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = **18**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
