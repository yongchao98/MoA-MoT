    "The user wants to find the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$ for a muon, along a direction $\\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$.\n\n**1. Identify the Quantum Mechanical Operators**\n\nThe components of the operator $\\vec{P}$ are given as:\n*   $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x$\n*   $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y$\n*   $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z$\nwhere $\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$ are the Pauli matrices. This operator $\\vec{P}$ is the spin angular momentum operator, usually denoted by $\\vec{S}$. A muon is a spin-1/2 particle.\n\n**2. Define the Direction Vector**\n\nThe direction vector $\\vec{n}$ is a unit vector that lies in the x-z plane. We can parameterize this vector using a single angle, $\\theta$, which represents the angle the vector makes with the positive z-axis. In Cartesian coordinates, this vector is:\n$\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$\n\n**3. Construct the Operator in the Direction $\\vec{n}$**\n\nThe operator for the component of $\\vec{P}$ along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is given by the dot product $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$.\n$P_n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n$P_n = (\\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\sigma_x)(\\sin\\theta) + (\\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\sigma_y)(0) + (\\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\sigma_z)(\\cos\\theta)$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}(\\sigma_x \\sin\\theta + \\sigma_z \\cos\\theta)$\n\nNow, we write this out in matrix form:\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\right)$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**4. Set up the Eigenvalue Equation**\n\nWe need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ that satisfies the eigenvalue equation $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$ for the given eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$.\n\n$\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nWe can cancel the factor $\\hbar/2$ from both sides:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThis matrix equation yields a system of two linear equations:\n1) $a\\cos\\theta + b\\sin\\theta = a$\n2) $a\\sin\\theta - b\\cos\\theta = b$\n\n**5. Solve for the Eigenvector Components**\n\nLet's solve the first equation for the ratio of $b$ to $a$:\n$b\\sin\\theta = a - a\\cos\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n\nNow, we use the half-angle trigonometric identities:\n$\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$\n$1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$\n\nSubstituting these into our equation:\n$b(2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)) = a(2\\sin^2(\\theta/2))$\n\nAssuming $\\sin(\\theta/2) \\neq 0$ (i.e., $\\vec{n}$ is not pointing along the -z axis), we can divide both sides by $2\\sin(\\theta/2)$:\n$b\\cos(\\theta/2) = a\\sin(\\theta/2)$\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n\nThis means the eigenvector is of the form:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = C \\begin{pmatrix} a_0 \\\\ b_0 \\end{pmatrix} = C \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$ for some normalization constant $C$. To get rid of the fraction, we can choose the unnormalized components to be $a_0 = \\cos(\\theta/2)$ and $b_0 = \\sin(\\theta/2)$.\nSo, the unnormalized eigenvector is $|\\psi\\rangle_{un} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n**6. Normalize the Eigenvector**\n\nThe squared norm of the eigenvector must be 1: $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = 1$.\n$|\\cos(\\theta/2)|^2 + |\\sin(\\theta/2)|^2 = \\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 1$\n\nThe vector is already normalized. Therefore, the normalized eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$ is:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe elements of this eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n\n**7. Compare with the Options**\n\n*   A) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2))$ - Incorrect.\n*   B) $(\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta))$ - Incorrect.\n*   C) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar)$ - Incorrect.\n*   D) $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2))$ - Correct.\n\n<<<D>>>"
