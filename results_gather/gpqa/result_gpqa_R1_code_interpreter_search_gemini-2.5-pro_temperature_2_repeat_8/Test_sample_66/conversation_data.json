    "An analysis of the quantum mechanical principles governing the addition of angular momentum is required to solve this problem.\n\n1.  **Identify the System and States:**\n    *   The system consists of two electrons, each in a p-orbital.\n    *   For a p-orbital, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is `l = 1`. So, for electron 1, `l₁ = 1`, and for electron 2, `l₂ = 1`.\n    *   The z-component of angular momentum for each electron, `m₁` and `m₂`, can take integer values from `-l` to `+l`. Thus, `m₁` and `m₂` can each be -1, 0, or 1.\n    *   The eigenvalues of the `Lz` operator are `mħ`.\n\n2.  **Define the Coupled State:**\n    *   The two-electron system is in a coupled state described by the ket `|l₁, l₂, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>`.\n    *   In this state, the total orbital angular momentum quantum number is `l = 2`.\n    *   The quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum is `m = -1`. The eigenvalue of the total `Lz` operator (`Lz = L₁z + L₂z`) is `mħ = -1ħ`.\n\n3.  **Define the Measurement:**\n    *   A measurement of the individual orbital angular momentum components, `L₁z` and `L₂z`, is performed.\n    *   The question asks for the joint probability of getting the eigenvalue `-ħ` for `L₁z` AND the eigenvalue `-ħ` for `L₂z`.\n    *   An eigenvalue of `-ħ` for `L₁z` corresponds to the electron being in a state with `m₁ = -1`.\n    *   An eigenvalue of `-ħ` for `L₂z` corresponds to the electron being in a state with `m₂ = -1`.\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for the probability of finding the system in the uncoupled state `|l₁, m₁; l₂, m₂> = |1, -1; 1, -1>`.\n\n4.  **Apply the Conservation Rule:**\n    *   A fundamental principle of angular momentum addition is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components.\n    *   This is expressed by the quantum number relation: `m = m₁ + m₂`.\n    *   In the given initial coupled state, the total `m` is `-1`.\n    *   The measurement outcome we are interested in has `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1`. For this outcome, the sum is `m₁ + m₂ = -1 + (-1) = -2`.\n    *   Since the initial state has `m = -1` and the potential final state would require `m = -2`, there is a contradiction. The total z-component of angular momentum must be conserved during the measurement process.\n    *   This means that it is physically impossible for a system in the state `|l=2, m=-1>` to be found in a state where `m₁+m₂ = -2`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Probability:**\n    *   In quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring a system, initially in state `|Ψ>`, to be in a final state `|Φ>`, is given by the square of the magnitude of the inner product: `P = |<Φ|Ψ>|²`.\n    *   Here, the initial state is `|Ψ> = |l=2, m=-1>` and the final state is `|Φ> = |m₁=-1, m₂=-1>`.\n    *   The probability is `P = |<m₁=-1, m₂=-1 | l=2, m=-1>|²`.\n    *   The coupled state `|l, m>` is a linear combination of the uncoupled states `|m₁, m₂>`:\n        `|l, m> = Σ(m₁, m₂) C(m₁, m₂) |m₁, m₂>`, where the coefficients `C` are called Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n    *   A crucial property of these coefficients is that they are zero unless `m = m₁ + m₂`.\n    *   Since we need the coefficient for the `|m₁=-1, m₂=-1>` component, and `-1 ≠ -1 + (-1)`, this coefficient must be zero.\n    *   Therefore, the state `|l=2, m=-1>` has no component along the state `|m₁=-1, m₂=-1>`. The inner product `<m₁=-1, m₂=-1 | l=2, m=-1>` is zero.\n    *   The probability is `0² = 0`.\n\nWe can confirm this with a simple Python code that computes the relevant Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.\n```python\nimport sympy.physics.wigner as wigner\n\n# Define the quantum numbers for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient\n# for the state |l, m> expanded in the |l1,m1; l2,m2> basis.\n# Coefficient: <l1, m1; l2, m2 | l, m>\nl1 = 1\nl2 = 1\nl = 2\nm1 = -1\nm2 = -1\nm = -1\n\n# Calculate the coefficient using sympy's clebsch_gordan function.\n# The function returns 0 if the selection rule m = m1 + m2 is not met.\ncg_coefficient = wigner.clebsch_gordan(l1, l2, l, m1, m2, m)\n\n# The probability is the square of the absolute value of the coefficient.\nprobability = abs(cg_coefficient)**2\n\nprint(f\"The probability is: {probability}\")\n```\nExecution of the code yields the output:\n```\nThe probability is: 0\n```\nThis confirms that the probability is zero.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem asks for the joint probability of measuring specific z-components of angular momentum for two electrons that are initially in a coupled angular momentum state.\n\n**1. Initial State Analysis:**\n*   The system consists of two electrons, each in a p-orbital. This means their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are `l₁ = 1` and `l₂ = 1`.\n*   The initial state of the two-electron system is the coupled state `|l, m> = |2, -1>`.\n*   In this state, the total angular momentum quantum number is `l = 2`, and the quantum number for the z-component of the total angular momentum is `m = -1`.\n\n**2. Measurement Outcome Analysis:**\n*   The measurement is of the individual z-components of orbital angular momentum, `L₁z` and `L₂z`.\n*   We want to find the probability of getting the eigenvalue `-ħ` for `L₁z` and `-ħ` for `L₂z`.\n*   The eigenvalue `-ħ` for `L₁z` corresponds to the quantum number `m₁ = -1`.\n*   The eigenvalue `-ħ` for `L₂z` corresponds to the quantum number `m₂ = -1`.\n*   Therefore, we are looking for the probability of the system being found in the uncoupled state described by `|m₁, m₂> = |-1, -1>`.\n\n**3. Applying Conservation of Angular Momentum:**\nA fundamental principle in the addition of angular momentum is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. This is expressed by the selection rule for the magnetic quantum numbers:\n`m = m₁ + m₂`\n\nLet's check if this rule is satisfied:\n*   From the initial state `|2, -1>`, we have `m = -1`.\n*   For the desired measurement outcome `|-1, -1>`, we have `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1`.\n*   The sum for the final state is `m₁ + m₂ = -1 + (-1) = -2`.\n\nComparing the values, we find that the initial `m = -1` is not equal to the sum required by the final state, `m₁ + m₂ = -2`.\n\n**4. Conclusion on Probability:**\nThe probability of a system in an initial state `|Ψ_initial>` being measured in a final state `|Ψ_final>` is given by the square of the magnitude of their inner product, `P = |<Ψ_final | Ψ_initial>|²`. In the language of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, the initial state `|l, m>` is a linear combination of the uncoupled states `|m₁, m₂>`. A specific uncoupled state `|m₁, m₂>` can only be part of this combination if `m = m₁ + m₂`.\n\nSince this condition is violated (`-1 ≠ -2`), the uncoupled state `|-1, -1>` is not a component of the coupled state `|2, -1>`. The projection of the initial state onto the final state is zero. Therefore, the probability of observing this outcome is exactly zero.\n\nThe executed Python code confirmed this by calculating the relevant Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, which is zero, leading to a probability of zero.\n\nThe correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
