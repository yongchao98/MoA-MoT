    "The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is an extension of the Standard Model (SM) that includes higher-dimensional operators suppressed by a new physics scale, Λ. These operators represent the low-energy effects of unknown physics at high energies. The construction of the SMEFT Lagrangian follows a set of fundamental principles. Let's analyze each of the proposed symmetries:\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry**: The Standard Model is a relativistic quantum field theory, and Lorentz invariance is a cornerstone of this framework. It dictates that the laws of physics are the same for all observers in inertial frames. SMEFT is constructed as a Lorentz-invariant theory, meaning that every operator added to the Lagrangian must be a Lorentz scalar. Violating Lorentz symmetry would require a radical departure from the principles of local quantum field theory.\n\n2.  **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry is a broader symmetry group that includes Lorentz transformations (boosts and rotations) as well as spacetime translations. As with Lorentz symmetry, it is a fundamental symmetry of spacetime on which the Standard Model and SMEFT are built. All terms in the Lagrangian must be invariant under Poincaré transformations.\n\n3.  **CP Symmetry**: CP symmetry is the combination of Charge Conjugation (C) and Parity (P) transformations. While most of the Standard Model interactions conserve CP, it is known to be violated by the weak interaction, specifically in the Yukawa sector leading to the CKM matrix for quarks. Since the SM itself violates CP, its effective field theory extension (SMEFT) is not required to preserve it. In fact, SMEFT provides a framework for parameterizing additional sources of CP violation from new physics, which could manifest in phenomena like electric dipole moments. Therefore, SMEFT operators are not required to respect CP symmetry.\n\n4.  **CPT Symmetry**: The CPT theorem is a fundamental result in quantum field theory. It states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be invariant under the combined action of C, P, and Time Reversal (T) transformations. Since SMEFT is constructed to be a local and Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory, all of its operators must respect CPT symmetry.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the fundamental principles of constructing SMEFT:\n-   Lorentz symmetry (1) must be respected.\n-   Poincaré symmetry (2) must be respected.\n-   CP symmetry (3) is not a required symmetry; it can be (and is) violated.\n-   CPT symmetry (4) must be respected due to the CPT theorem.\n\nTherefore, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz, Poincaré, and CPT. This corresponds to options 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
