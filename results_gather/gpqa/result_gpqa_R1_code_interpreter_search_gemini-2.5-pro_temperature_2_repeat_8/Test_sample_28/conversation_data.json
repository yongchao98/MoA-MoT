    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The primary objective is to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. The question states that a single gene is responsible for this compound's synthesis. Therefore, the most effective strategy is to create a \"loss-of-function\" or \"knockout\" mutation in this gene, which will prevent the production of a functional enzyme or protein.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Types of Mutations:** We need to consider which type of mutation is most likely to completely destroy the function of a protein.\n    *   **Silent Mutation:** Changes the DNA sequence but not the amino acid sequence. It has no effect on the protein.\n    *   **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid for another. The effect is variable; it might have no effect, or it could inactivate the protein if the change occurs at a critical site (like an active site). It's not a guaranteed knockout.\n    *   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes a codon for an amino acid into a STOP codon (in DNA: TAA, TAG, TGA). This causes translation to terminate prematurely, resulting in a truncated, and almost always non-functional, protein. This is a very effective way to knock out a gene, especially if the mutation occurs early in the gene.\n    *   **Frameshift Mutation:** Caused by an insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides that is not a multiple of three. This shifts the \"reading frame\" of the codons, scrambling the entire amino acid sequence downstream of the mutation. This almost always leads to a completely non-functional protein and often introduces a premature stop codon. This is also a very effective knockout method.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Intact Gene and Mutants:** The gene starts with the sequence `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT...`.\n    *   The `ATG` is the START codon (Methionine).\n    *   The next codon is `TTT` (Phenylalanine).\n    *   The third codon is `CTC` (Leucine).\n    So, the protein begins: Met-Phe-Leu...\n\n    Now let's examine the codon changes in each mutant at that third position.\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:** The sequence `ATG TTC TAC...` contains the codon `TAC` in the third position. `CTC` (Leucine) has been mutated to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It might not be sufficient to eliminate the protein's function.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:** The sequence `ATG TTC TAA...` contains the codon `TAA` in the third position. `CTC` (Leucine) has been mutated to `TAA`. **TAA is a STOP codon.** This is a **nonsense mutation**. The protein translation will stop after just two amino acids (Met-Phe). The resulting tiny peptide will be completely non-functional. This is a definitive knockout mutation.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:** A comparison of the full string lengths shows this mutant is 3 base pairs longer than the intact gene. This likely represents an in-frame insertion of a single amino acid. While this can affect protein function, it's generally less disruptive than a nonsense or frameshift mutation, as the rest of the protein sequence remains correct.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:** A comparison of the full string lengths shows this mutant is 1 base pair shorter than the intact gene. This indicates a deletion of a single nucleotide, which would cause a **frameshift mutation**. This is also a very effective way to knock out a gene.\n\n4.  **Compare the Best Candidates (Mutant 2 vs. Mutant 4):** Both a nonsense mutation (Mutant 2) and a frameshift mutation (Mutant 4) are highly likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. However, the sequence provided for Mutant 2 unambiguously shows a classic nonsense mutation (`CTC` -> `TAA`) that introduces a stop codon at a very early position (the 3rd codon). This is a clear and certain mechanism for knocking out the gene. The sequence for Mutant 4 is more complex and less clearly represents a single, simple deletion event. Given the clarity and catastrophic effect on the protein, the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most probable and definitive answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
