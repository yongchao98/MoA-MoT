    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Define the Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its host star and the energy it radiates back into space. The formula is:\n$T_{eq} = T_* \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1-A)^{1/4}$\nwhere:\n*   $T_*$ is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   $R_*$ is the radius of the star.\n*   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   $A$ is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 ($T_{eq,1}$) and Planet 2 ($T_{eq,2}$).\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_* \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1-A_1)^{1/4}}{T_* \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1-A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star, $T_*$ and $R_*$ are the same for both and cancel out. The problem also states that both planets have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). Therefore, the terms $(1-A_1)^{1/4}$ and $(1-A_2)^{1/4}$ also cancel out. The formula simplifies to:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_2} \\right)^{1/2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}$\n\nTo find the temperature ratio, we first need to determine the ratio of the semi-major axes of the planets' orbits.\n\n**2. Relate Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity Data**\n\nThe problem provides information about the Doppler shift ($\\Delta \\lambda$) caused by each planet, which is a result of the radial velocity (RV) method. The maximum Doppler shift ($\\Delta \\lambda_{max}$) is related to the star's maximum radial velocity, also known as the RV semi-amplitude ($K$), by:\n$K = c \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_{max}}{\\lambda_0}$\nwhere $c$ is the speed of light and $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude ($K$) is related to the planet's mass ($M_p$), the star's mass ($M_*$), and the semi-major axis ($a$) by the following formula. (We assume the orbital inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ because the planets are detected by the transit method, so $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$):\n$K = \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$\nwhere $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for $a$:\n$\\sqrt{a} = \\frac{M_p \\sqrt{G}}{K \\sqrt{M_*}} \\implies a = \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_* K^2}$\n\nNow we can find the ratio $a_2/a_1$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_2^2 / (M_* K_2^2)}{G M_1^2 / (M_* K_1^2)} = \\frac{M_2^2}{M_1^2} \\cdot \\frac{K_1^2}{K_2^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_2}{M_1}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\nThe ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes ($K_1/K_2$) can be found directly from the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{c \\cdot \\Delta \\lambda_1 / \\lambda_0}{c \\cdot \\Delta \\lambda_2 / \\lambda_0} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_1}{\\Delta \\lambda_2}$\n\nSubstituting this back into the equation for $a_2/a_1$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_2}{M_1}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_1}{\\Delta \\lambda_2}\\right)^2$\n\n**3. Calculate the Temperature Ratio**\n\nNow we substitute the expression for $a_2/a_1$ into our simplified temperature ratio equation from Step 1:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_2}{M_1}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_1}{\\Delta \\lambda_2}\\right)^2} = \\frac{M_2}{M_1} \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_1}{\\Delta \\lambda_2}$\n\n**4. Substitute the Given Values**\n\nWe are given:\n*   Mass of Planet 1 ($M_1$) = 7 $M_{earth}$\n*   Mass of Planet 2 ($M_2$) = 5 $M_{earth}$\n*   Doppler shift from Planet 1 ($\\Delta \\lambda_1$) = 0.03 Å\n*   Doppler shift from Planet 2 ($\\Delta \\lambda_2$) = 0.04 Å\n\nPlug these values into the final equation:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nTo get the final numerical value, we perform the division.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\n# Planet 1 mass ratio\nM1_mass = 7\n# Planet 2 mass ratio\nM2_mass = 5\n# Planet 1 doppler shift\ndelta_lambda1 = 0.03\n# Planet 2 doppler shift\ndelta_lambda2 = 0.04\n\n# Calculate the ratio of masses (M2/M1)\nmass_ratio = M2_mass / M1_mass\n\n# Calculate the ratio of doppler shifts (delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2)\ndoppler_ratio = delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures is the product of these two ratios\ntemperature_ratio = mass_ratio * doppler_ratio\n\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```",
    "The calculation shows the ratio is approximately 0.536.\n\nLet's check the options:\nA) ~ 0.53\nB) ~ 1.30\nC) ~ 0.98\nD) ~ 1.05\n\nOur calculated value of 0.5357... is very close to 0.53. The other parameters given in the problem (star's mass, star's radius, star's temperature, planet radii, and the specific wavelength of the [OI] line) are not needed for this specific calculation, as they cancel out. The key relationships are between equilibrium temperature and orbital distance, and between orbital distance and the planet's mass and its induced radial velocity shift.\n\nThe derivation is as follows:\n$T_{eq} \\propto (1/a)^{1/2}$\n$K \\propto M_p / \\sqrt{a}$\n$K \\propto \\Delta \\lambda$\n\nFrom the second relation, $\\sqrt{a} \\propto M_p/K$.\nSubstitute this into the first relation:\n$T_{eq} \\propto 1/\\sqrt{a} \\propto K/M_p$.\nSubstitute the third relation into this:\n$T_{eq} \\propto \\Delta \\lambda / M_p$.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_1 / M_{p,1}}{\\Delta \\lambda_2 / M_{p,2}} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_1}{\\Delta \\lambda_2} \\times \\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}}$\n\nUsing the given values:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{0.03 \\text{ Å}}{0.04 \\text{ Å}} \\times \\frac{5 M_{\\oplus}}{7 M_{\\oplus}} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times \\frac{5}{7} = \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis matches the calculation from the code. The closest answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
