    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of peaks in each chromatogram.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral ketone with one stereocenter at C5, which has the (S) configuration.\n    The structure is: CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.\n    The chiral center is C5: -CH(OCH3)-.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces a ketone to an alcohol.\n*   **Reaction:** The carbonyl group at C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group (-OH). The carbon at C3 is a prochiral center because it is planar (sp2 hybridized) and has three different groups attached. The hydride ion (H-) from LAH can attack this carbonyl carbon from two different faces (top or bottom). This attack creates a new chiral center at C3.\n*   **Products:** The original chiral center at C5 is unaffected by the reaction. The new chiral center at C3 can have either an (R) or (S) configuration. This leads to the formation of two products:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:** These two products have the same molecular formula and connectivity but are not mirror images of each other (one center is the same, the other is opposite). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**. Since the starting material is a single enantiomer and the reagent (LAH) is achiral, a mixture of these two diastereomers will be formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral diketone.\n    The structure is: CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4) followed by an acidic workup. NaBH4 is a reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols. \"Excess\" means both ketone groups will be reduced.\n*   **Reaction:** The two carbonyl groups at C2 and C4 are both reduced to hydroxyl groups, creating two new chiral centers. The product is pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Products:** With two new chiral centers (C2 and C4), up to 2^2 = 4 stereoisomers are possible: (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    Let's analyze their relationships:\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the starting material and reagent are achiral, they will be produced in equal amounts (a racemic mixture).\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has chiral centers, but because the molecule is symmetric (the substituents on C2 are the same as on C4), there is an internal plane of symmetry. This makes the molecule achiral overall. This is a **meso compound**. (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) describe the same meso compound.\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:** The enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) are diastereomers of the meso compound. In total, Reaction II produces **three distinct stereoisomers**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the combined product mixture with normal-phase HPLC**\n\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   It **can** separate constitutional isomers (molecules with different connectivity), which the products from Reaction I and Reaction II are.\n*   It **can** separate diastereomers, as they have different physical properties.\n*   It **cannot** separate enantiomers, as they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Enantiomers will co-elute and appear as a single peak.\n\nLet's count the number of expected peaks for the combined mixture:\n1.  **(3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol** (from Reaction I)\n2.  **(3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol** (from Reaction I)\n    These are diastereomers, so they will be separated into **two peaks**.\n3.  The racemic mixture of **(2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** (from Reaction II). As enantiomers, they will not be separated and will give **one peak**.\n4.  The **meso-(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** (from Reaction II).\n    The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. Therefore, it will be separated from them, giving another **one peak**.\n\nAssuming no accidental co-elution between the products of Reaction I and Reaction II (which is reasonable as they are constitutional isomers with different formulas and functional groups), the total number of peaks will be the sum of the peaks from each group of isomers.\nTotal peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 2 (from Rxn I) + 1 (for the enantiomeric pair from Rxn II) + 1 (for the meso from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the combined product mixture with chiral HPLC**\n\nA chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase. This allows it to distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   It can separate all compounds that normal-phase HPLC can (constitutional isomers, diastereomers).\n*   Crucially, it **can also separate enantiomers**.\n\nLet's count the peaks based on the total number of unique stereoisomers produced:\n*   **From Reaction I:**\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    These are two distinct compounds and will give **two peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:**\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    These are enantiomers and will be separated by the chiral column into **two peaks**.\n    5.  meso-(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    This is a distinct stereoisomer (a diastereomer of the others) and will give its own **one peak**.\n\nThe total number of unique stereoisomers in the mixture is 5. A chiral HPLC, under ideal conditions, can separate all of them.\nTotal peaks in chiral HPLC = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from the enantiomers of Rxn II) + 1 (from the meso of Rxn II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts:\n*   **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n*   **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
