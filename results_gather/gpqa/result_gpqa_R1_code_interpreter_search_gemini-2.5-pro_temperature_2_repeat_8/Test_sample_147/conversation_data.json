    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y and Compound A2.**\n    The problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (YF_n) with a fluorine weight percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. We can establish a relationship between the molar mass of Y (M_Y) and the number of fluorine atoms (n).\n    The molar mass of fluorine (F) is approximately 18.9984 g/mol.\n    The formula for weight percentage is:\n    ɷF = (n * M_F) / (M_Y + n * M_F)\n    0.3196 = (n * 18.9984) / (M_Y + n * 18.9984)\n    By rearranging the formula, we can solve for M_Y:\n    M_Y = (n * 18.9984 / 0.3196) - (n * 18.9984)\n    M_Y = (59.444 * n) - (18.9984 * n)\n    M_Y ≈ 40.446 * n\n\n    We need to find an element Y and an integer n (a plausible oxidation state) that satisfy this relationship. Let's test integer values for n:\n    *   n=1: M_Y ≈ 40.45 g/mol (Close to K, Ca)\n    *   n=2: M_Y ≈ 80.9 g/mol (Close to Br)\n    *   n=3: M_Y ≈ 121.3 g/mol (Very close to Antimony, Sb, with M = 121.76 g/mol)\n    *   n=4: M_Y ≈ 161.8 g/mol (Close to Dy)\n    *   n=5: M_Y ≈ 202.2 g/mol (Between Au and Tl/Pb)\n    *   n=6: M_Y ≈ 242.7 g/mol (Close to Pu, Am)\n\n    Let's verify the fluorine percentage for the most likely candidate, Antimony (Sb) with n=3.\n    A2 would be SbF3.\n    ɷF(SbF3) = (3 * 18.9984) / (121.760 + 3 * 18.9984) * 100%\n    ɷF(SbF3) = 56.9952 / 178.7552 * 100% = 31.88%\n    This value is extremely close to the given 31.96%, with a relative difference of only 0.25%. This is the best fit among all plausible elements. So we can confidently identify **Y = Sb** and **A2 = SbF3**.\n\n2.  **Identify Compounds A1 and A3.**\n    *   A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (room temperature) into A2 (SbF3) and fluorine (F2). The reaction is `A1 -> SbF3 + F2`. For this reaction to be balanced, A1 must have a higher fluorine-to-antimony ratio than SbF3. The most common and stable higher fluoride of antimony is SbF5. So, the reaction would be `SbF5 -> SbF3 + F2`. This makes **A1 = SbF5**.\n    *   There are some inconsistencies: SbF5 is a colorless liquid, not a bright-red solid, and its decomposition to SbF3 requires high temperatures (~400 °C), not 293 K. These are likely inaccuracies in the problem statement, which is common in complex chemistry puzzles.\n    *   A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. SbF5 is a very strong oxidizing agent and Lewis acid, known to react with xenon (e.g., `XeF2 + 2SbF5 -> [XeF][Sb2F11]`). This property strongly supports A1 being SbF5.\n    *   A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y (Sb) and also interacts with xenon. This also points to the strongest oxidizing agent, so **A3 = SbF5**.\n\n3.  **Identify Compounds A4 and A5.**\n    *   The problem states: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n    *   Here, Y = Sb. So the reaction is `Sb + A4 -> A5` with `n(Sb) : n(A4) = 1:1`.\n    *   A4 is a binary fluoride of antimony. The two main candidates are SbF3 and SbF5.\n    *   This type of reaction, involving an element and its compound to form a compound of intermediate oxidation state, is a comproportionation. Let's analyze the possibilities.\n        *   If A4 = SbF5, the reaction would be `2Sb + 3SbF5 -> 5SbF3`. This is a known reaction, but the molar ratio of reactants is `Sb : SbF5 = 2:3`, which is not the 1:1 ratio given in the problem.\n        *   If A4 = SbF3, the reaction is `Sb + SbF3 -> A5` with a 1:1 molar ratio. This fits the stoichiometry perfectly. A5 would be a subfluoride like `Sb2F3` or more simply represented as `SbF`.\n    *   Let's check other properties. \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\". If **A4 = SbF3**, it is a colorless (or white) solid and is soluble in solvents like HF, so a colorless solution is plausible.\n    *   The final clue is that A5 decomposes in water into two substances. A subfluoride like SbF (antimony in +1 oxidation state) would be unstable in water and would disproportionate into elemental antimony (Sb, oxidation state 0) and an antimony(III) compound (e.g., Sb2O3 or SbF3). This fits the description.\n    *   Therefore, the most consistent identification is **A4 = SbF3**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4.**\n    We have identified A4 as antimony trifluoride (SbF3). Let's calculate its molecular weight.\n    M_Y = M_Sb = 121.76 g/mol\n    M_F = 18.998 g/mol\n    MW(A4) = MW(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 * 18.998 ≈ 121.76 + 57.00 = **178.76 g/mol**.\n\n5.  **Determine the Correct Range.**\n    The calculated molecular weight is 178.76 g/mol. We check which of the given ranges contains this value.\n    A) 220-240\n    B) 140-160\n    C) 160-180\n    D) 110-130\n    The value 178.76 falls within the range of 160-180.\n\n<<<C>>>"
