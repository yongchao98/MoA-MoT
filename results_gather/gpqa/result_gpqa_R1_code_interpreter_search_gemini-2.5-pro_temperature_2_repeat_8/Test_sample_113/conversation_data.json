    "*   **Analysis of Reaction 1:**\n    *   The first reaction is the conversion of butan-2-one to 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile using sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n    *   This is a classic example of cyanohydrin formation.\n    *   The mechanism involves the nucleophilic attack of the cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN on the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n    *   This attack forms an alkoxide intermediate: CH₃CH₂-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₃.\n    *   To form the final product, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, this alkoxide intermediate must be protonated to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   This requires a source of protons (H⁺), which is typically provided by an acid. Therefore, reagent A must be an acid. In aqueous solutions, this is represented as the hydronium ion, H₃O⁺.\n\n*   **Analysis of Reaction 2:**\n    *   The second reaction is the conversion of 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.\n    *   This reaction involves the transformation of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   This process is known as nitrile hydrolysis.\n    *   Nitrile hydrolysis can be carried out under either acidic or basic conditions. The reaction shows H₂O is present, and we need to choose a catalyst (reagent B).\n    *   Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis is a common and effective method. It requires a strong acid, such as hydrochloric acid (HCl) or sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄), along with water and often heat. The strong acid protonates the nitrile, making the carbon atom more susceptible to nucleophilic attack by water.\n    *   Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is a weak acid and is generally not strong enough to effectively catalyze the complete hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid.\n    *   Therefore, reagent B must be a strong acid, and HCl is a suitable choice.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   Reagent A for the cyanohydrin formation is an acid source, H₃O⁺.\n    *   Reagent B for the nitrile hydrolysis is a strong acid, HCl.\n    *   Matching these findings with the given options, we find that option B fits both requirements.\n\n<<<B>>>"
