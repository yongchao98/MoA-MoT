    "*   **Analysis of Part A: Tautomerism**\n\n    1.  **Tautomerism** is a type of constitutional isomerism where two isomers, called tautomers, are in equilibrium and are readily interconvertible. A common form is keto-enol tautomerism, which involves the migration of a proton from an α-carbon (carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group) to the carbonyl oxygen, along with a shift of a double bond. This process requires the presence of at least one hydrogen atom on an sp³-hybridized α-carbon.\n        Keto form: `H-C(sp³)-C=O`\n        Enol form: `C=C-OH`\n\n    2.  **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone)**: Its structure consists of a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two carbonyl groups. The carbons alpha to the carbonyl groups are part of carbon-carbon double bonds within the ring. Therefore, all alpha-carbons are sp²-hybridized, not sp³-hybridized. Since there are no sp³-hybridized alpha-carbons with hydrogen atoms, benzoquinone cannot undergo the standard keto-enol tautomerization.\n\n    3.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: Its structure is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are sp³-hybridized (-CH₂-) and are alpha to two carbonyl groups each. These alpha-hydrogens are acidic and can easily move to a carbonyl oxygen. This tautomerization leads to the formation of 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol).\n        *   Keto form: Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione (C₆H₆O₃)\n        *   Enol form: 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (C₆H₆O₃)\n        The molecular formulas are identical. The enol form is aromatic and highly stable, so the equilibrium strongly favors this form. Thus, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione exhibits tautomerism.\n\n    4.  **Conclusion for A**: The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\n    1.  **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable. A common feature of chiral molecules is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n    2.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The chemical formula is `CH₃-CH(OH)-C(=O)OCH₃`. Let's examine the central carbon atom (carbon-2). It is bonded to:\n        *   a methyl group (-CH₃)\n        *   a hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        *   a hydrogen atom (-H)\n        *   a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n        Since all four groups are different, carbon-2 is a chiral center. Therefore, the molecule is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism (it has two enantiomers).\n\n    3.  **Dimethyl fumarate**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is `CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃`, where the `-COOCH₃` groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C bond. Any molecule with a center of inversion is achiral. Since it is achiral, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n    4.  **Conclusion for B**: The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Answer Combination**\n\n    *   The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   The compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n    *   This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
