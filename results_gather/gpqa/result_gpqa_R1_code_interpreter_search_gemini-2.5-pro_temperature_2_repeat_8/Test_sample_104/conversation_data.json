    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Source of Variability:** The problem describes a star with rotational modulation causing changes in brightness. This is because one hemisphere is uniformly bright (at the star's effective temperature), while the other hemisphere is covered in cooler, dark spots. As the star rotates, we see different amounts of the spotted surface, leading to a periodic change in the total light we receive.\n    *   **Maximum Brightness (F_max):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is facing the observer. The entire visible disk has the star's effective temperature, T_eff.\n    *   **Minimum Brightness (F_min):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere is facing the observer. This disk is a mix of the hotter stellar surface and the cooler spots.\n\n2.  **Quantify the Flux using the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The flux (energy emitted per unit area per unit time) of a blackbody is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature (F ∝ T⁴).\n    *   Let T_star = 6000 K be the star's effective temperature.\n    *   Let T_spot = T_star - 1000 K = 5000 K be the temperature of the spots.\n    *   Let f = 0.20 be the filling factor of the spots on the spotted hemisphere.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Relative Fluxes:** We can calculate the flux for the two extreme viewing angles. Let's consider the projected disk of the star facing us.\n    *   **F_max:** The flux is proportional to T_star⁴. So, F_max ∝ T_star⁴.\n    *   **F_min:** When the spotted hemisphere faces us, a fraction `f` of the visible disk's area is at T_spot, and the remaining fraction `(1-f)` is at T_star. The total flux is the sum from both components.\n        F_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_star⁴ + f * T_spot⁴.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Amplitude of the Stellar Variability:** The amplitude of the signal is the relative change in flux, which is the difference between the maximum and minimum flux, divided by the maximum flux.\n    *   Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max\n    *   Amplitude = [T_star⁴ - ((1 - f) * T_star⁴ + f * T_spot⁴)] / T_star⁴\n    *   Amplitude = [T_star⁴ - T_star⁴ + f * T_star⁴ - f * T_spot⁴] / T_star⁴\n    *   Amplitude = [f * (T_star⁴ - T_spot⁴)] / T_star⁴\n    *   Amplitude = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_star)⁴]\n\n5.  **Model the Exoplanet Transit:** An exoplanet passing in front of its star blocks a portion of the star's light. The resulting drop in brightness (the transit depth, which is the amplitude of the exoplanet signal) is approximately the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.\n    *   Transit Depth = (Area_planet) / (Area_star)\n    *   Transit Depth = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²)\n    *   Transit Depth = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\n6.  **Equate the Amplitudes and Solve:** We want the exoplanet to produce the same amplitude signal as the spotted star.\n    *   (R_pl / R_star)² = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_star)⁴]\n    *   R_pl / R_star = sqrt( f * [1 - (T_spot / T_star)⁴] )\n\n7.  **Compute the Final Value:** Now, we plug in the numbers.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the given parameters\nf = 0.20  # Filling factor of the spots\nT_star = 6000.0  # Effective temperature of the star in K\nT_spot = 5000.0  # Temperature of the spots in K\n\n# Calculate the amplitude of the signal due to stellar spots\n# Amplitude = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_star)⁴]\nspot_amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)**4)\n\n# The amplitude of an exoplanet transit signal is (R_pl / R_star)²\n# We set the amplitudes equal to each other\n# (R_pl / R_star)² = spot_amplitude\n# Therefore, R_pl / R_star = sqrt(spot_amplitude)\nRpl_over_Rstar = math.sqrt(spot_amplitude)\n\nprint(Rpl_over_Rstar)\n```\n\nThe code calculates the value of R_pl / R_star.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The code execution confirms the result of the calculation.\n\n1.  **Stellar Variability Amplitude Calculation:**\n    *   `T_spot / T_star` = 5000 / 6000 = 5/6\n    *   `(T_spot / T_star)⁴` = (5/6)⁴ ≈ 0.48225\n    *   `1 - (T_spot / T_star)⁴` ≈ 1 - 0.48225 = 0.51775\n    *   Amplitude_spots = `f * [1 - (T_spot / T_star)⁴]` = 0.20 * 0.51775 = 0.10355\n\n2.  **Exoplanet Transit Depth:**\n    *   The transit depth is equal to the spot amplitude: Depth = 0.10355\n    *   Depth = `(R_pl / R_star)²`\n    *   `R_pl / R_star` = sqrt(Depth) = sqrt(0.10355)\n\n3.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   `R_pl / R_star` ≈ 0.32179\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) ~0.39\nB) ~0.11\nC) ~0.32\nD) ~0.07\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.32 matches option C. To determine the radius of the hypothetical exoplanet relative to the star's radius, we need to first calculate the brightness variation caused by the star spots and then equate that to the dimming caused by an exoplanet transit.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1.  **Model the Star's Flux:**\n    The flux (brightness) of a star is proportional to the fourth power of its effective temperature (Stefan-Boltzmann law: `F = σT⁴`, where `F` is flux per unit area and `σ` is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant). The total luminosity is the flux integrated over the star's visible disk.\n\n2.  **Calculate Flux at Maximum Brightness:**\n    Maximum brightness (F_max) occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is facing the observer. The entire visible disk has a uniform temperature `T_star`.\n    *   `F_max` is proportional to `T_star⁴`.\n\n3.  **Calculate Flux at Minimum Brightness:**\n    Minimum brightness (F_min) occurs when the hemisphere covered in spots is facing the observer.\n    *   The filling factor of the spots is `f = 0.20` (or 20%).\n    *   The fraction of the surface at the star's temperature (`T_star`) is `1 - f`.\n    *   The fraction of the surface at the spot temperature (`T_spot`) is `f`.\n    *   The temperature of the spots is `T_spot = T_star - 1000K = 6000K - 1000K = 5000K`.\n    *   The total flux from this spotted hemisphere is a weighted average of the flux from the unspotted parts and the spotted parts.\n    *   `F_min` is proportional to `(1 - f) * T_star⁴ + f * T_spot⁴`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Amplitude of Stellar Variability:**\n    The photometric amplitude is the relative change in flux: `Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max`.\n    *   `Amplitude = (T_star⁴ - [(1 - f) * T_star⁴ + f * T_spot⁴]) / T_star⁴`\n    *   `Amplitude = (T_star⁴ - T_star⁴ + f * T_star⁴ - f * T_spot⁴) / T_star⁴`\n    *   `Amplitude = (f * T_star⁴ - f * T_spot⁴) / T_star⁴`\n    *   `Amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot⁴ / T_star⁴))`\n    *   `Amplitude = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_star)⁴]`\n\n5.  **Model the Exoplanet Transit:**\n    An exoplanet transiting its star blocks an amount of light proportional to the ratio of the planet's projected area to the star's projected area. This dimming, or transit depth, is the amplitude of the signal.\n    *   `Transit Depth = (Area_planet) / (Area_star)`\n    *   `Transit Depth = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²`\n\n6.  **Equate Amplitudes and Solve for R_pl / R_star:**\n    We are looking for an exoplanet that produces the same amplitude signal as the spotted star.\n    *   `(R_pl / R_star)² = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_star)⁴]`\n    *   `R_pl / R_star = sqrt(f * [1 - (T_spot / T_star)⁴])`\n\nNow we will use a Python script to perform the calculation with the given values.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the given parameters\nf = 0.20          # Filling factor of spots\nT_star = 6000.0   # Effective temperature of the star (K)\ndelta_T = 1000.0  # Temperature difference (K)\nT_spot = T_star - delta_T # Temperature of the spots (K)\n\n# Calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation due to spots\n# Amplitude = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_star)⁴]\nspot_amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)**4)\n\n# The transit depth (amplitude) for an exoplanet is (R_pl / R_star)²\n# We set the two amplitudes to be equal\n# (R_pl / R_star)² = spot_amplitude\n# So, R_pl / R_star = sqrt(spot_amplitude)\n\nRpl_over_Rstar = math.sqrt(spot_amplitude)\n\nprint(f\"{Rpl_over_Rstar=}\")\n\n```\n<<<C>>>",
