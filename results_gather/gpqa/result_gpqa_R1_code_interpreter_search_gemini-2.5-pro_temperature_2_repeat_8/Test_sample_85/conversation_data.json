    "This problem requires a detailed analysis of two different reduction reactions leading to stereoisomeric products. We need to determine the stereochemistry of the starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material and Products**\n\n*   **Starting Material Structure:** The options suggest the starting material is a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid. The full name is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This means it's a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid).\n    The structure is: HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(=O)(5)-O-isobutyl.\n    *   It has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at one end and an isobutyl ester group (-COO-isobutyl) at the other.\n    *   It has a single chiral center at carbon C3, which is bonded to an ethyl group. This chiral center can have an (R) or (S) configuration.\n\n*   **Product Structure:** The product in both reactions is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a δ-lactone (a 6-membered cyclic ester).\n    *   The reaction involves the reduction of one of the carbonyl functional groups to an alcohol, followed by an intramolecular esterification (lactonization) that forms the 6-membered ring.\n    *   The stereocenter in the product is at C4, which corresponds to the C3 of the starting material. The reaction yields either the (R) or (S) enantiomer of the lactone.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reagents and Reaction Pathways**\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-lactone\n    *   **Reagent Selectivity:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Pathway:**\n        1.  The ester group (-COO-isobutyl) at C5 is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n        2.  The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at C1 remains unchanged.\n        3.  The intermediate formed is (3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid). Its stereochemistry at C3 is the same as in starting material A.\n        4.  Under acidic workup (H⁺), the hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the carboxylic acid carbonyl at C1, forming the 6-membered lactone and eliminating a molecule of water.\n\n*   **Reaction 2:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-lactone\n    *   **Reagent Selectivity:** BH₃ (borane) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n    *   **Pathway:**\n        1.  The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at C1 is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n        2.  The ester group (-COO-isobutyl) at C5 remains unchanged.\n        3.  The intermediate is (isobutyl 4-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoate). Its stereochemistry at C3 is the same as in starting material B.\n        4.  Under acidic workup (H⁺), the newly formed hydroxyl group (from C1) attacks the ester carbonyl at C5, forming the same 6-membered lactone via transesterification, eliminating a molecule of isobutanol.\n\n**3. Analyze the Stereochemistry**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in understanding how the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules assign the (R)/(S) designation and how this assignment changes (or doesn't) during each reaction.\n\n*   **CIP Priorities in Starting Material (SM):**\n    The groups attached to the chiral center C3 are:\n    1.  `-CH₂-COO-isobutyl` (ester side)\n    2.  `-CH₂-COOH` (acid side)\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl)\n    4.  `-H`\n    Comparing the two main chains, the ester chain has higher priority than the acid chain because at the first point of difference (the oxygen atom), it's bonded to a carbon (of isobutyl) rather than a hydrogen.\n    Priority order: `-CH₂-COOR` (P1) > `-CH₂-COOH` (P2) > `-Et` (P3) > `-H` (P4).\n\n*   **CIP Priorities in Product (Lactone):**\n    The groups attached to the chiral center C4 are:\n    1.  `-CH₂-C(=O)O-` (carbonyl side of the lactone ring)\n    2.  `-CH₂-CH₂O-` (oxygen side of the lactone ring)\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl)\n    4.  `-H`\n    Comparing the two ring fragments, the one containing the carbonyl group (`-C(=O)`) has higher priority than the one with the single-bonded oxygen (`-CH₂O-`).\n    Priority order: `-CH₂-C(=O)O-` (P1') > `-CH₂-CH₂O-` (P2') > `-Et` (P3') > `-H` (P4').\n\n*   **Connecting SM to Product:**\n\n    *   **Reaction 1 (LiBH₄):**\n        *   The high-priority ester group in A (`-CH₂COOR`, P1) is reduced to an alcohol and becomes the low-priority oxygen side of the lactone (`-CH₂CH₂O-`, P2').\n        *   The low-priority acid group in A (`-CH₂COOH`, P2) forms the high-priority carbonyl side of the lactone (`-CH₂C(=O)O-`, P1').\n        *   The priorities of the top two groups are **swapped** (P1 → P2', P2 → P1'). Swapping the priorities of two groups on a chiral center inverts the R/S designation.\n        *   Therefore, to obtain an **(R)-lactone**, the starting material A must have the **(S) configuration**.\n        *   (S)-A → (R)-Lactone.\n\n    *   **Reaction 2 (BH₃):**\n        *   The high-priority ester group in B (`-CH₂COOR`, P1) forms the high-priority carbonyl side of the lactone (`-CH₂C(=O)O-`, P1').\n        *   The low-priority acid group in B (`-CH₂COOH`, P2) is reduced and forms the low-priority oxygen side of the lactone (`-CH₂CH₂O-`, P2').\n        *   The priority order of the groups is **preserved** (P1 → P1', P2 → P2'). Therefore, the R/S designation remains the same.\n        *   To obtain an **(S)-lactone**, the starting material B must also have the **(S) configuration**.\n        *   (S)-B → (S)-Lactone.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBoth starting materials, A and B, must be the same compound with the (S) configuration.\n*   A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
