    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the product of the reaction:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Starting Material\n\nThe starting material is **(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane**.\n\n*   **Parent Structure:** `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` is an epoxide ring fused to a cyclohexane ring. The oxygen atom is atom #7. The epoxide is formed across the C1-C6 bond. For the fusion to be stable, the two C-O bonds must be *cis* to each other.\n*   **Substituents:** There are methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The absolute configurations are given as (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S). We will use these configurations to track the stereochemistry through the reaction.\n\nLet's visualize the structure. We'll represent the cyclohexane ring as a planar hexagon with wedges (up, beta) and dashes (down, alpha) to denote stereochemistry. A detailed analysis shows that to satisfy the given R/S assignments, the epoxide oxygen must be alpha (down, dashed). The substituents are then arranged as follows:\n*   Epoxide Oxygen: **alpha** (down)\n*   C1-Methyl: **beta** (up)\n*   C6-Hydrogen: **beta** (up)\n*   C3-Methyl and C4-Methyl: The given configurations dictate their specific alpha/beta orientation. We don't need to determine their exact orientation, but simply track that C3 is (R) and C4 is (R).\n\n### 2. Analyze the Reagent and Reaction Mechanism\n\n*   **Reagent:** `Me2CuLi` (lithium dimethylcuprate) is a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of the methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Reaction of an organocuprate with an epoxide. The problem states two key rules for this reaction:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile (Me⁻) attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring. This is an SN2-type reaction.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The attack causes an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon that is attacked.\n\n### 3. Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)\n\nThe epoxide ring consists of carbons C1 and C6. We need to compare their steric hindrance.\n*   **C1:** This carbon is bonded to C2, C6, the epoxide oxygen, and a **methyl group**. It is a **quaternary** carbon center.\n*   **C6:** This carbon is bonded to C1, C5, the epoxide oxygen, and a **hydrogen atom**. It is a **tertiary** carbon center.\n\nThe quaternary carbon C1 is significantly more sterically hindered than the tertiary carbon C6. Therefore, the methyl nucleophile will attack **C6**.\n\n### 4. Determine the Product's Structure and Stereochemistry\n\n1.  **Ring Opening:** The Me⁻ attacks C6, and the C6-O bond breaks. This opens the epoxide ring, and after an aqueous workup, the oxygen at C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   The OH group will be on C1. Its stereochemistry is the same as the original epoxide oxygen, which was **alpha** (down).\n    *   A new methyl group is added to C6.\n\n2.  **Stereochemistry of the Attack:** The attack on C6 is a backside (SN2) attack.\n    *   The C6-O bond is alpha (down).\n    *   Therefore, the incoming Me⁻ must attack from the opposite, **beta** (up), face.\n    *   This attack causes an inversion of configuration at C6. The starting configuration was (6S), so the new configuration at this carbon will be **(R)**.\n\n3.  **Stereochemistry of Other Centers:** The stereocenters that are not part of the reaction (C1, C3, and C4) remain unchanged.\n    *   C1 retains its **(R)** configuration.\n    *   C3 retains its **(R)** configuration.\n    *   C4 retains its **(R)** configuration.\n\n### 5. Name the Final Product\n\n1.  **Numbering the Product:** The product is a substituted cyclohexanol. According to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated as C1. In this reaction, the OH group is on the original C1, so `New C1 = Old C1`. We then number the ring to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible set of locants.\n    *   The methyl groups are at positions: Old C1, Old C6, Old C3, Old C4.\n    *   If we number counter-clockwise from New C1 (i.e., New C2 = Old C6), the locants are: **1, 2, 5, 4**. Rearranging: 1,2,4,5.\n    *   If we number clockwise from New C1 (i.e., New C2 = Old C2), the locants are: **1, 6, 3, 4**. Rearranging: 1,3,4,6.\n    *   Comparing the locant sets `(1,2,4,5)` and `(1,3,4,6)`, the first set is lower. So, the correct numbering is counter-clockwise.\n    *   The product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options A and C.\n\n2.  **Assigning Stereochemistry to the Product:** We now map the stereocenters from the reactant to the product using the new numbering.\n    *   **New C1** (from Old C1): Configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n    *   **New C2** (from Old C6): Configuration is inverted from (S) to **(R)**.\n    *   **New C4** (from Old C4): Configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n    *   **New C5** (from Old C3): Configuration is retained as **(R)**. (Note: Although renumbering can sometimes change the R/S descriptor even if the center is untouched, in this specific case, the priority of neighboring groups does not change, so R remains R).\n\n3.  **Final Product Name:** Putting it all together, the product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
