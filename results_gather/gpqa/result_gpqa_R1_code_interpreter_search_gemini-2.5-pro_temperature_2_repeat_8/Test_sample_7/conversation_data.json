As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the phenotypes of the single mutants:**\n*   **Wild-type (WT):** 100% resistance (our baseline).\n*   **g1 mutant:** 75% resistance. This means the G1 gene product contributes to 25% of the total resistance (100% - 75%).\n*   **g2 mutant:** 0% resistance. This means the G2 gene product is absolutely essential for any resistance. Its loss is catastrophic.\n*   **g3 mutant:** 50% resistance. This means the G3 gene product contributes to 50% of the total resistance (100% - 50%).\n\n**2. Analyze the phenotypes of the double mutants to determine gene interactions (epistasis):**\n*   **Epistasis** is a genetic interaction where one gene masks the phenotypic effect of another gene. In a simple epistatic interaction, the phenotype of the double mutant will be identical to the phenotype of one of the single mutants (the epistatic gene).\n\n*   **g1g2 double mutant:** This mutant has 0% resistance. This is the same phenotype as the g2 single mutant (0% resistance). This means the effect of the g2 mutation completely masks the effect of the g1 mutation. Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G1**. This suggests G2 acts upstream of G1, or is an essential component in the same pathway that G1 contributes to.\n\n*   **g2g3 double mutant:** This mutant has 0% resistance. This is also the same phenotype as the g2 single mutant (0% resistance). This means the effect of the g2 mutation also masks the effect of the g3 mutation. Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G3**. This suggests G2 acts upstream of G3.\n\n*   **g1g3 double mutant:** This mutant has 10% resistance. This phenotype is not the same as the g1 mutant (75%) or the g3 mutant (50%). Therefore, there is no simple epistatic relationship between G1 and G3 in the classical sense. Their effects are synergistic (the combined effect is greater than the sum of the parts), as an additive loss would have resulted in 100% - 25% - 50% = 25% resistance, but the actual resistance is much lower at 10%.\n\n**3. Identify the likely transcription factor:**\n*   The problem states that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream of others.\n*   Since G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, and its knockout results in a complete loss of function, it is the most logical candidate for an upstream transcription factor that regulates the expression of G1 and G3. A possible pathway is: **G2 → (G1, G3) → Resistance**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the given options based on the analysis:**\n\n*   **A) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   \"G1 is a transcription factor\": Unlikely. Our analysis points to G2 being the upstream TF.\n    *   \"G2 and G3 show pleiotropy\": We cannot determine this from the given data (pleiotropy is one gene affecting multiple traits; we only measured one trait).\n    *   **\"G2 is epistatic towards G1\": This is CORRECT.** As shown in step 2, the g1g2 phenotype (0%) is the same as the g2 phenotype (0%).\n\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   \"G2 is a transcription factor\": This is plausible.\n    *   \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\": This is INCORRECT. Redundancy means one gene can compensate for the other. Here, knocking out either g1 or g3 causes a significant drop in resistance, so they are not redundant.\n    *   \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\": This is INCORRECT. The g1g3 phenotype (10%) is not the same as the g1 phenotype (75%).\n\n*   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   \"G2 is a transcription factor\": This is plausible.\n    *   \"G1 and G3 has the same promoter\": We cannot determine this from the data.\n    *   \"G3 is epistatic towards G1\": This is INCORRECT. The g1g3 phenotype (10%) is not the same as the g3 phenotype (50%).\n\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   \"G2 is a transcription factor\": This is plausible.\n    *   \"G1 and G3 show pleiotropy\": We cannot determine this from the data.\n    *   \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\": This is INCORRECT.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOptions B, C, and D contain statements about gene interactions (\"gene redundancy\", \"G1 epistatic towards G3\", \"G3 epistatic towards G1\") that are directly contradicted by the experimental data. Option A is the only choice that makes a correct statement about epistasis based on the data: **\"G2 is epistatic towards G1\"**. Although the other two claims in option A are questionable, it is the only option that is not demonstrably false in its analysis of gene interaction. Therefore, it is the best possible answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
