    "*   **1. Understanding the System**\n    *   We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Since they are spin-1/2 particles, they are fermions and must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n    *   The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. The single-particle energy levels for this system are given by the formula:\n        `E_n = n^2 * (pi^2 * \\hbar^2) / (2mL^2)`\n        where n = 1, 2, 3, ... is the principal quantum number.\n    *   The problem defines a base energy unit `E = (pi^2 * \\hbar^2) / (2mL^2)`. So, the single-particle energy levels can be simplified to:\n        `E_n = n^2 * E`\n    *   The Pauli Exclusion Principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. A quantum state here is defined by both its energy level (n) and its spin projection (ms = +1/2 for spin up or -1/2 for spin down). This means that each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n*   **2. Calculating the Ground State Energy (E_ground)**\n    *   To find the ground state, we fill the energy levels from the lowest energy up, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle, until all four particles are placed.\n    *   **Level n=1:** We place two particles in this level (one spin up, one spin down).\n        *   Energy contributed: `1^2*E + 1^2*E = 2E`.\n    *   **Level n=2:** We place the remaining two particles in this level (one spin up, one spin down).\n        *   Energy contributed: `2^2*E + 2^2*E = 4E + 4E = 8E`.\n    *   **Total Ground State Energy:** Summing the energies of all four particles.\n        *   `E_ground = (2 * 1^2*E) + (2 * 2^2*E) = 2E + 8E = 10E`.\n\n*   **3. Calculating the First Excited State Energy (E_1st_excited)**\n    *   The first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible total energy above the ground state. We achieve this by moving one particle from the highest occupied energy level in the ground state to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n    *   Ground state configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=2.\n    *   To create the lowest energy excitation, we move one particle from the `n=2` level to the `n=3` level.\n    *   The new configuration is: 2 particles in `n=1`, 1 particle in `n=2`, and 1 particle in `n=3`.\n    *   **Total First Excited State Energy:**\n        *   `E_1st_excited = (2 * 1^2*E) + (1 * 2^2*E) + (1 * 3^2*E)`\n        *   `E_1st_excited = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`.\n\n*   **4. Calculating the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd_excited)**\n    *   The second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest total energy. We need to consider all possible single-particle excitations from the ground state and find the one with the second-lowest energy increase.\n    *   **Ground state configuration:** {2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=2}. Energy = 10E.\n    *   **Possible next states (excitations):**\n        *   **Excitation A:** Move one particle from `n=2` to `n=3`. This gives {2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3}.\n            *   Energy = `2*(1E) + 1*(4E) + 1*(9E) = 15E`. This is the first excited state.\n        *   **Excitation B:** Move one particle from `n=1` to `n=3`. This gives {1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3}.\n            *   Energy = `1*(1E) + 2*(4E) + 1*(9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E`.\n        *   **Excitation C:** Move both particles from `n=2` to `n=3`. This gives {2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3}.\n            *   Energy = `2*(1E) + 2*(9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E`.\n        *   **Excitation D:** Move one particle from `n=2` to `n=4`. This gives {2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4}.\n            *   Energy = `2*(1E) + 1*(4E) + 1*(16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E`.\n    *   Comparing the energies of the possible excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E,...), the lowest is 15E (the first excited state) and the next lowest is 18E.\n    *   Therefore, the **Total Second Excited State Energy** is `18E`.\n\n*   **5. Conclusion**\n    *   Ground State Energy = 10E\n    *   First Excited State Energy = 15E\n    *   Second Excited State Energy = 18E\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
