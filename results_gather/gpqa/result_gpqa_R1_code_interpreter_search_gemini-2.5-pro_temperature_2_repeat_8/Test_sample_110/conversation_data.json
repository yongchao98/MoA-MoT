    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the two reactions.\n\n### **Reaction 1 Analysis**\n\n**Reaction:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK as a base.\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction:** This is a classic Michael addition reaction. It involves the addition of a nucleophile (an enolate in this case) to an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound (a Michael acceptor).\n\n2.  **Identify the nucleophile:** The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), is a strong, sterically hindered base. It will deprotonate the starting ketone at an α-carbon (a carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group) to form an enolate ion.\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   Let's identify the α-carbons: C2 and C6.\n    *   **C2** is bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group, so it is a quaternary carbon with no α-protons.\n    *   **C6** is bonded to a methyl group and one hydrogen atom.\n    *   Since only C6 has a proton, the deprotonation must occur at C6. This forms a single regioisomeric enolate where the double bond is between C1 and C6. The C6 atom will be the nucleophilic center.\n\n3.  **Identify the Michael acceptor (electrophile):** The electrophile is ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH−COOEt). In a Michael addition, the nucleophile attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated system (the CH₂ group in this case).\n\n4.  **Determine the product structure:** The nucleophilic C6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between these two atoms.\n    *   The ketone ring remains.\n    *   The original substituents stay in place: an ethyl and a methyl group on C2, and a methyl group on C6.\n    *   A new group, derived from ethyl acrylate, is added to C6. After protonation during workup, this group is -CH₂-CH₂-COOEt.\n    *   So, the product has a cyclohexanone ring where C6 is now a quaternary center, bonded to the C5 of the ring, the C1 of the ring (carbonyl carbon), a methyl group, and the new -CH₂CH₂COOEt group.\n\n5.  **Name the product (Product A):** According to IUPAC nomenclature, the ester functional group has higher priority than the ketone. Therefore, the molecule is named as a derivative of ethyl propanoate.\n    *   The main chain is `ethyl ...propanoate`: `EtO-C(=O)-CH₂(α)-CH₂(β)-`. The cyclohexanone part is a substituent on the β-carbon. Let's renumber this part for naming.\n    *   The propanoate chain is attached to the cyclohexyl ring. The cyclohexyl ring is the substituent. The point of attachment on the ring is assigned C1 for the substituent name. In our product, this is C6 of the original ketone.\n    *   Let's establish the new numbering for the substituent name:\n        *   **C1 (new)** = C6 (old) → Point of attachment. It has a methyl group.\n        *   **C2 (new)** = C1 (old) → Has the carbonyl (oxo) group.\n        *   **C3 (new)** = C2 (old) → Has an ethyl and a methyl group.\n    *   Putting it together, the substituent name is (3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl).\n    *   The full product name is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n6.  **Compare with options:** This name for Product A matches the one given in options B and C. The name in options A and D places the oxo group at C4, which would result from an incorrect reaction pathway. Thus, we can eliminate options A and D.\n\n---\n\n### **Reaction 2 Analysis**\n\n**Reaction:** 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile with KOH and H₂O.\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction:** This is also a Michael addition.\n\n2.  **Identify the nucleophile:** The base KOH deprotonates 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂). The protons on the carbon α to the electron-withdrawing nitro group are acidic (pKa ≈ 10). The deprotonation occurs at C1, forming a nitronate anion, which acts as the nucleophile. The nucleophilic atom is C1 of the 1-nitropropane.\n\n3.  **Identify the Michael acceptor (electrophile):** The electrophile is (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃−CH=CH−CN). This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The nucleophile will attack the β-carbon (the CH attached to the methyl group).\n\n4.  **Determine the product structure:** The nucleophilic C1 of the nitronate attacks the β-carbon (C3) of but-2-enenitrile. A new C-C bond is formed.\n    *   The fragment from 1-nitropropane is `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-`.\n    *   The fragment from but-2-enenitrile, after addition and protonation by H₂O, is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   Combining these fragments gives the final product: `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n\n5.  **Name the product (Product B):** According to IUPAC nomenclature, the nitrile group (-CN) is the principal functional group.\n    *   We find the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon.\n        `CN(1) - CH₂(2) - CH(CH₃)(3) - CH(NO₂)(4) - CH₂(5) - CH₃(6)`\n    *   The longest chain has 6 carbons, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The full product name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n6.  **Compare with options:** This name for Product B matches the one given in options A and C. The name in options B and D, `2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile`, corresponds to a different structure that would not be formed from the given reactants.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A** is `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n*   **Product B** is `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`.\n\nMatching these two products with the given choices, we find that **Option C** is the only one that correctly identifies both major products.\n\n<<<C>>>"
