    "The user wants to find the concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], in a solution initially containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n1.  **Define the Chemical Equilibrium:**\n    The formation of the calcium-EDTA complex is an equilibrium reaction:\n    Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻\n\n    The problem provides the formation constant (also known as stability constant) for this reaction:\n    K_f = [[Ca(EDTA)]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\n    To find the free Ca²⁺ concentration, it's easier to consider the dissociation of the complex:\n    [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\n2.  **Set up an ICE Table:**\n    Let's set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to track the concentrations. Let 'x' be the concentration of [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻ that dissociates.\n\n| Species          | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n|------------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n| [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻     | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| Ca²⁺             | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| EDTA⁴⁻           | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n3.  **Use the Equilibrium Constant Expression:**\n    Now, substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n    K_f = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n    5 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / x²\n\n4.  **Solve for x:**\n    Because the formation constant K_f is very large (5 x 10¹⁰ >> 1), the equilibrium lies heavily on the side of the complex. This means that very little of the complex dissociates, so 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M.\n    We can make a simplifying approximation: 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.\n\n    The equation becomes:\n    5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\n    Now, we rearrange the equation to solve for x²:\n    x² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\n    x² ≈ (2 x 10⁻²) / (5 x 10¹⁰)\n    x² ≈ 0.4 x 10⁻¹²\n    x² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n\n    Now, we solve for x, which represents the equilibrium concentration of Ca²⁺:\n    x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\n    To make the exponent even for an easier square root calculation, we can write it as:\n    x = √(40 x 10⁻¹⁴)\n    x = (√40) x 10⁻⁷\n    Since √36 = 6 and √49 = 7, √40 is approximately 6.3.\n    x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n    So, the concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\n5.  **Check the Approximation:**\n    Our assumption was that x << 0.02.\n    Is 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ << 0.02? Yes, it is significantly smaller, so the approximation was valid.\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated concentration [Ca²⁺] ≈ 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M matches option B.\n\nWe can also perform the calculation without approximation for higher precision.\n```python\nimport cmath\n\n# Coefficients for the quadratic equation 5e10*x^2 + x - 0.02 = 0\na = 5e10\nb = 1\nc = -0.02\n\n# Calculate the discriminant\ndiscriminant = (b**2) - 4*a*c\n\n# Find the two roots\nroot1 = (-b - cmath.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)\nroot2 = (-b + cmath.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)\n\n# The concentration must be a positive real number\n# The first root will be negative, the second will be the positive physical solution.\n# We are interested in the magnitude of the positive root.\npositive_root = root2.real\n\nprint(f\"{positive_root:.2e}\")\n```\n[6.32e-07]\n\nThe precise calculation confirms that the concentration of calcium ions is 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is a breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Reaction and Equilibrium Constant:** The problem involves the equilibrium between the calcium-EDTA complex and its dissociated ions. While the formation constant (K_f) is given for the forward reaction (Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻), it's more intuitive to consider the dissociation reaction to find the free Ca²⁺ concentration.\n\n    Dissociation reaction: [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\n2.  **Initial, Change, Equilibrium (ICE) Table:** We can use an ICE table to determine the equilibrium concentrations. We start with 0.02 M of the complex and assume an unknown amount 'x' dissociates.\n\n    | Species          | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n    |------------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n    | [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻     | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| Ca²⁺             | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| EDTA⁴⁻           | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n3.  **Equilibrium Expression:** The formation constant, K_f, is given as:\n    K_f = [[Ca(EDTA)]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻])\n    K_f = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\n    Substitute the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table into the expression:\n    5 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n    5 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / x²\n\n4.  **Approximation and Calculation:** Since K_f is extremely large (5 x 10¹⁰), the equilibrium lies heavily to the left (favoring the complex). This means that a very small amount of the complex will dissociate, so 'x' will be much smaller than the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can make the simplifying assumption that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n\n    The equation becomes:\n    5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\n    Now, solve for x:\n    x² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\n    x² ≈ (2 x 10⁻²) / (5 x 10¹⁰)\n    x² ≈ 0.4 x 10⁻¹²\n    x² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n\n    x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\n    x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The concentration of Ca²⁺ ions at equilibrium is represented by 'x'.\n    [Ca²⁺] ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M. This value matches option B. The code execution also confirms this result precisely.\n\n<<<B>>>"
