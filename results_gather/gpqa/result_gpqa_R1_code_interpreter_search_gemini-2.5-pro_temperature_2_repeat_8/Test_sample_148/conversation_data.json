    "*   **Analyze the Observations:**\n    1.  **Â¹H NMR:** There are two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton. They have similar chemical shifts and their combined integral is correct (1H). Spin-spin coupling is ruled out. This indicates the presence of two different chemical environments for that specific proton.\n    2.  **LC-MS:** At elevated temperature, the sample separates into two distinct peaks in the liquid chromatography (LC) trace. These two peaks have equal intensity. Critically, the mass spectrometry (MS) data shows that both peaks correspond to compounds of the *exact same mass*, and this mass matches the expected product.\n\n*   **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n        *   Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images. They have different physical properties.\n        *   **NMR Compatibility:** Because they are chemically distinct, diastereoisomers will have different NMR spectra. Protons in different diastereomers will have different chemical shifts. A 1:1 mixture of two diastereoisomers would show two sets of peaks. It's plausible that the biggest difference would be for the protons closest to the stereocenter that differs between the two isomers (like an alpha-proton), which perfectly matches the observation. The equal integrals suggest a 1:1 mixture.\n        *   **LC-MS Compatibility:** Because they have different physical properties, diastereoisomers can be separated by standard (achiral) liquid chromatography. This would result in two distinct peaks, as observed. The equal LC peak intensities correspond to the equal NMR integrals, indicating a 1:1 mixture. Since they are isomers, they have the same molecular formula and therefore the same mass, which is consistent with the MS data. This option fits all observations perfectly. This is a common outcome in peptide synthesis if an amino acid racemizes during the coupling step. For instance, coupling a pure L-peptide chain to a D/L mixture of the next amino acid would yield two diastereomeric products (L-D and L-L) in roughly equal amounts.\n\n    *   **B) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:**\n        *   A precursor would be a different molecule, likely with a different molecular weight. The MS data shows both peaks have the *same mass* as the final product. This option is inconsistent with the mass spectrometry results.\n\n    *   **C) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:**\n        *   This is an ambiguous term describing a potential side reaction. A common side reaction during coupling is racemization of the activated amino acid. Racemization leads to the formation of a mixture of diastereoisomers. Therefore, this option describes a potential *cause* for the situation in option A. However, option A is a better and more direct description of the *state* of the mixture that is being observed by NMR and LC-MS. Option A describes *what* the mixture is, which directly explains the data.\n\n    *   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n        *   Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. They have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n        *   **NMR Incompatibility:** Standard NMR spectroscopy is an achiral technique and cannot distinguish between enantiomers. A mixture of enantiomers would show a single set of peaks, identical to that of a pure enantiomer. This contradicts the observation of two alpha-proton peaks.\n        *   **LC Incompatibility:** Standard LC (e.g., using a C18 column) is also an achiral separation technique and cannot separate enantiomers. A mixture would elute as a single peak. This contradicts the observation of two LC peaks.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The only explanation that fits all the experimental evidence (distinguishable by NMR, separable by standard LC, but having the same mass) is that the compound is a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\n<<<A>>>"
