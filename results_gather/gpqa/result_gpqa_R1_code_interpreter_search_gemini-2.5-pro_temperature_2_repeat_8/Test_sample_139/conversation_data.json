    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:**\n    *   **Clue 1: Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope.** This points towards elements like Hydrogen (Deuterium, D), Carbon (¹³C), etc.\n    *   **Clue 2: Reaction with liquid Y is violent, releasing gas W.** This suggests X is highly reactive, like an alkali metal hydride or a complex hydride. The reaction is likely with water or a similar protic solvent.\n    *   **Clue 3: Gas W has an equal number of neutrons and protons.** Let's analyze potential gases:\n        *   ¹H₂ (Hydrogen gas): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. No.\n        *   ⁴He (Helium): 2 protons, 2 neutrons. Yes. Unlikely product from a violent reaction of a complex substance.\n        *   **²D₂ (Deuterium gas): 2 protons (1+1), 2 neutrons (1+1). Yes.** This is a strong candidate since X contains a heavy isotope.\n        *   ¹⁴N₂ (Nitrogen gas): 14 protons, 14 neutrons. Yes. Plausible but less likely given other clues.\n        *   D₂O (Heavy water vapor): 10 protons (1+1+8), 10 neutrons (1+1+8). Yes.\n        The release of D₂ gas is a common outcome when a deuteride reacts with a source of deuterium ions.\n\n2.  **Identify X, Y, W, G, and B:**\n    *   **Organic Chemistry Clue (Clue 8 & 9):** \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" and \"X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\"\n        *   Keto acids (e.g., pyruvic acid, R-CO-COOH) have 3 oxygen atoms.\n        *   Common reagents for keto acids are reducing agents. The \"analog\" hint points to something like LiAlH₄ / LiAlD₄ or NaBH₄ / NaBD₄.\n        *   Strong reducing agents like Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄) reduce both the ketone and the carboxylic acid group. R-CO-COOH -> R-CH(OH)-CH₂(OH). The resulting product, a diol, has **2 oxygen atoms**. This fits the clue perfectly.\n        *   Milder agents like NaBH₄ would only reduce the ketone, leaving the carboxylic acid, resulting in a product with 3 oxygen atoms (R-CH(OH)-COOH). This doesn't fit.\n        *   Therefore, X's analog is LiAlH₄, making **Substance X = LiAlD₄ (Lithium Aluminium Deuteride)**.\n\n    *   **Revisiting the Violent Reaction (Clues 2-7):**\n        *   If X = LiAlD₄, what is Y? For the reaction to produce D₂ gas (W), the reacting liquid Y must be a source of deuterium ions. The most obvious choice is **heavy water, D₂O**.\n        *   The reaction is: `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O -> LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`\n        *   This reaction is indeed violent.\n        *   **Gas W:** The released gas is D₂. As established, D₂ has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This matches.\n        *   **Precipitate G:** In the products, LiOD is soluble, but **Al(OD)₃ (Aluminium deuteroxide)** is an insoluble, gelatinous precipitate. So, G = Al(OD)₃. This matches.\n        *   **Heating G to release B:** Heating a metal hydroxide (or deuteroxide) causes decomposition: `2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. The substance released is **B = D₂O**.\n        *   **Melting point of B:** The melting point of D₂O is 3.82 °C, which is **276.97 K**. This value is \"very close to 277 K\". This confirms all our identifications.\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements present, ordered by atomic number (which determines lightest/heaviest), are Hydrogen (H), Lithium (Li), and Aluminium (Al).\n    *   Lightest element: **Hydrogen (H)**.\n    *   Heaviest element: **Aluminium (Al)**.\n    *   The formula LiAlD₄ contains:\n        *   One atom of the heaviest element (Al).\n        *   Four atoms of the lightest element (H, present as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The instruction \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed\" means we need to add the masses of the one Al atom and all four D atoms.\n    *   We use the integer masses of the most common/relevant isotopes, as the options are integers:\n        *   Mass of an Aluminium (²⁷Al) atom ≈ 27 amu.\n        *   Mass of a Deuterium (²H) atom ≈ 2 amu.\n    *   Cumulative mass = (Mass of 1 Al atom) + (Mass of 4 D atoms)\n    *   Cumulative mass = 27 + (4 × 2) = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n```python\n# The reasoning process has identified Substance X as LiAlD4.\n# The lightest element is Hydrogen (present as Deuterium, D).\n# The heaviest element is Aluminium (Al).\n# The calculation requires summing the atomic masses of all atoms of these two elements in the formula.\n# We will use integer masses for the isotopes: Al-27 and D-2 (H-2).\n\n# Mass of one Aluminium atom\nmass_Al = 27\n\n# Mass of one Deuterium atom\nmass_D = 2\n\n# Number of Aluminium atoms in LiAlD4\nnum_Al = 1\n\n# Number of Deuterium atoms in LiAlD4\nnum_D = 4\n\n# Calculate the cumulative mass\ncumulative_mass = (num_Al * mass_Al) + (num_D * mass_D)\n\nprint(cumulative_mass)\n```\n<<<\n35\n>>>\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{35}$.",
    "The user wants me to identify a substance (X) and then perform a calculation based on its composition.\n\n**Step 1: Analyzing the Clues to Identify Substance X**\n\n*   **Clue:** X reacts with a certain keto acid (which has 3 oxygen atoms) to give a product with 2 oxygen atoms. X and its close analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry.\n*   **Reasoning:** This is a strong clue pointing to a reduction reaction. Common reducing agents in organic chemistry are LiAlH₄ (Lithium Aluminium Hydride) and NaBH₄ (Sodium Borohydride). LiAlH₄ is a powerful reducing agent that can reduce both a ketone (C=O) and a carboxylic acid (-COOH) to alcohols (-OH).\n    *   Reaction with LiAlH₄: R-CO-COOH + LiAlH₄ → R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH. The product is a diol, which contains **2 oxygen atoms**. This fits the clue.\n*   **Conclusion so far:** The \"close analog\" is LiAlH₄.\n\n*   **Clue:** Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements.\n*   **Reasoning:** Since the analog is LiAlH₄, the element with a common heavier isotope is Hydrogen (H). Its heavier stable isotope is Deuterium (D, or ²H).\n*   **Hypothesis:** Substance X is the deuterated version of LiAlH₄, which is **LiAlD₄ (Lithium Aluminium Deuteride)**.\n\n**Step 2: Verifying the Hypothesis with the Remaining Clues**\n\nLet's test if X = LiAlD₄ fits the other clues.\n\n*   **Clue:** X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.\n*   **Reasoning:** The violent reaction of LiAlD₄ would be with a protic solvent like water. To get specific products, let's consider heavy water (D₂O) as liquid Y.\n    *   Reaction: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) -> LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)`\n    *   The reaction is known to be violent.\n    *   The gas released is W = D₂ (Deuterium gas).\n    *   Let's check the proton/neutron count for a D₂ molecule:\n        *   Each Deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n        *   A D₂ molecule has **2 protons** and **2 neutrons**.\n    *   The number of protons and neutrons is the same. This perfectly matches the clue.\n\n*   **Clue:** A precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B is very close to 277 K.\n*   **Reasoning:**\n    *   From our reaction, the products are LiOD (soluble) and **Al(OD)₃** (Aluminium Deuteroxide, insoluble). So, the precipitate G is Al(OD)₃.\n    *   When G (Al(OD)₃) is heated, it decomposes: `2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`.\n    *   The substance released is B = D₂O (heavy water).\n    *   The melting point of D₂O is 3.82 °C. Let's convert this to Kelvin: 3.82 + 273.15 = 276.97 K.\n    *   276.97 K is indeed \"very close to 277 K\".\n\nAll clues consistently confirm that **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n**Step 3: Performing the Final Calculation**\n\n*   **Task:** Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n*   **Elements in LiAlD₄:** Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), Hydrogen (as Deuterium, D).\n*   **Identifying Lightest and Heaviest:**\n    *   Based on atomic number/position in the periodic table, Hydrogen (Z=1) is the lightest and Aluminium (Z=13) is the heaviest.\n*   **Summing Masses:** The instruction is to sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the formula unit.\n    *   There is **1 atom of Aluminium (Al)**. The mass of the most common isotope is **27**.\n    *   There are **4 atoms of Deuterium (D)**. The mass of a deuterium isotope is **2**.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Cumulative Mass = (Mass of 1 Al atom) + (Mass of 4 D atoms)\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 27 + (4 × 2)\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 27 + 8 = 35\n\nThe code confirms this calculation.\n```python\n# The identified substance X is Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD4).\n# The constituent elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (in the form of its isotope Deuterium, D).\n# The lightest element is Hydrogen (H).\n# The heaviest element is Aluminium (Al).\n# The question asks for the sum of the atomic masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements in the compound.\n# We will use integer masses for the common isotopes: Al-27 and D-2.\n\n# Mass of one Aluminium (Al) atom\nmass_of_heaviest_element = 27\n\n# Mass of one Deuterium (D) atom\nmass_of_lightest_element_isotope = 2\n\n# Number of Al atoms in LiAlD4\ncount_of_heaviest_element = 1\n\n# Number of D atoms in LiAlD4\ncount_of_lightest_element = 4\n\n# Calculate the total mass\ntotal_mass = (count_of_heaviest_element * mass_of_heaviest_element) + (count_of_lightest_element * mass_of_lightest_element_isotope)\n\nprint(total_mass)\n```\n<<<\nD\n>>>",
    "Based on the detailed step-by-step reasoning and the python code execution, the conclusion is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance X:** Through a series of logical deductions based on the chemical reactions described, Substance X is identified as Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The reaction with a keto acid to produce a compound with 2 oxygens points to its analog, LiAlH₄, being a powerful reducing agent.\n    *   The incorporation of a heavy isotope points to Deuterium replacing Hydrogen, making X = LiAlD₄.\n    *   The violent reaction with liquid Y (identified as heavy water, D₂O) releases gas W (identified as D₂), which has an equal number of protons (2) and neutrons (2).\n    *   The precipitate G is Al(OD)₃, which upon heating releases B (D₂O), whose melting point (276.97 K) is very close to 277 K.\n\n2.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (as Deuterium, D).\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen. The heaviest element is Aluminium.\n    *   The formula contains 1 atom of Aluminium and 4 atoms of Deuterium.\n    *   Using the integer atomic mass units for the relevant isotopes (²⁷Al and ²D):\n    *   Sum = (Mass of 1 Al atom) + (Mass of 4 D atoms)\n    *   Sum = 27 + (4 × 2) = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\nThe calculated value is 35, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
