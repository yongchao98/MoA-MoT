    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary objective is to calculate the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 ($L_1$) to that of Star_2 ($L_2$), which is the value of $L_1 / L_2$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Luminosity Formula:** For a star radiating as a perfect black body, its total luminosity (L) is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    $L = 4 \\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\n    where:\n    *   $R$ is the radius of the star.\n    *   $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   $T$ is the effective surface temperature of the star in its own rest frame.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:** Using the Stefan-Boltzmann formula for both stars, we can find their luminosity ratio:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4 \\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4 \\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4}$\n    The constants $4\\pi$ and $\\sigma$ cancel out, leaving:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (\\frac{R_1}{R_2})^2 (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4$\n\n4.  **Use the Given Information for Radii:** The problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2.\n    $\\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5$\n    Therefore, the radius term in our ratio is:\n    $(\\frac{R_1}{R_2})^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25$\n\n5.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio:**\n    *   The temperature (T) of a star is related to the peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{rest}$) of its emitted spectrum by Wien's Displacement Law:\n        $T = \\frac{b}{\\lambda_{rest}}$\n        where $b$ is Wien's displacement constant. This means $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{rest}$. Therefore, $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{rest,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,1}}$.\n    *   The problem states that \"the wavelengths at which the stars **appeared brightest**... are the same.\" This refers to the **observed** peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$), which is affected by the star's motion relative to the observer (Doppler effect). So, $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$.\n    *   The observed wavelength is related to the rest-frame wavelength by the Doppler shift formula. For speeds much less than the speed of light ($v \\ll c$), the approximation is $\\lambda_{obs} \\approx \\lambda_{rest}(1 + v_r/c)$, where $v_r$ is the radial velocity (positive for receding objects).\n    *   For Star_1, $v_{r1} = 0$, so $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{rest,1}$.\n    *   For Star_2, $v_{r2} = 700 \\text{ km/s} = 7 \\times 10^5 \\text{ m/s}$. We assume this positive velocity means the star is receding. Thus, $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{rest,2}(1 + v_{r2}/c)$.\n    *   Since $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$, we have:\n        $\\lambda_{rest,1} = \\lambda_{rest,2}(1 + v_{r2}/c)$\n    *   Now we can find the ratio of the rest-frame temperatures, which are needed for the luminosity calculation:\n        $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{rest,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,1}} = \\frac{\\lambda_{rest,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,2}(1 + v_{r2}/c)} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_{r2}/c}$\n\n6.  **Handle Irrelevant Information:** The problem provides the mass ratio and radial velocities.\n    *   **Mass:** The mass information ($M_1/M_2 = 1.5$) is a distractor. While a mass-luminosity relationship exists, the provided data on radii and peak wavelengths allows for a more direct calculation via the Stefan-Boltzmann law.\n    *   **Radial Velocity:** The radial velocity data is crucial, as shown above, for determining the correct temperature ratio by accounting for the Doppler shift on the observed peak wavelength.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Ratio:** Substitute the derived ratios for radius and temperature back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (\\frac{R_1}{R_2})^2 (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4 = (1.5)^2 \\times (\\frac{1}{1 + v_{r2}/c})^4$\n\n    Now, we plug in the numerical values:\n    *   $(1.5)^2 = 2.25$\n    *   $v_{r2} = 7 \\times 10^5$ m/s\n    *   $c$ (speed of light) $\\approx 2.998 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n\n    The calculation is best performed with a script to maintain precision.\n\n```python\n# Define the constants and given ratios\nR_ratio_sq = 1.5**2  # (R1/R2)^2\nv2 = 700000.0        # Radial velocity of Star_2 in m/s\nc = 299792458.0      # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# Calculate the temperature ratio term based on Doppler shift\n# T1/T2 = 1 / (1 + v2/c)\nT_ratio_fourth_power = (1.0 / (1.0 + v2 / c))**4\n\n# Calculate the final luminosity ratio\nLuminosity_ratio = R_ratio_sq * T_ratio_fourth_power\n\nprint(Luminosity_ratio)\n```\n\n2.2291244305908994\n\nThe calculated value is approximately 2.229. Rounding to two decimal places gives 2.23. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The user wants me to solve an astrophysics problem. Here's my plan to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Goal:** The main objective is to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star 1 to the luminosity of Star 2, i.e., $L_1 / L_2$.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Physics Principles:**\n    *   **Luminosity of a Black Body:** A star's luminosity (L) is governed by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$, where $R$ is the radius, $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the star's surface temperature in its own rest frame.\n    *   **Temperature and Wavelength:** The temperature (T) is related to the peak emission wavelength ($\\lambda_{rest}$) in the star's rest frame by Wien's Displacement Law: $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{rest}$.\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** The observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) is different from the rest-frame wavelength ($\\lambda_{rest}$) if the star is moving relative to the observer. For a non-relativistic velocity $v$, the formula is $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{rest}(1 + v_r/c)$, where $v_r$ is the radial velocity (positive for recession, negative for approach) and c is the speed of light.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:**\n    Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the two luminosities is:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4}$\n    Canceling the constants ($4\\pi$ and $\\sigma$), we get:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4$\n\n4.  **Incorporate the Given Data:**\n    *   **Radius Ratio:** The problem states $R_1 = 1.5 \\times R_2$, so $\\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5$.\n    *   **Wavelength Information:** \"the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest... are the same\". This means the *observed* peak wavelengths are equal: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$.\n    *   **Radial Velocities:** $v_1 = 0$ km/s and $v_2 = 700$ km/s. A positive velocity conventionally means the object is receding.\n    *   **Irrelevant Information:** The mass ratio ($M_1/M_2 = 1.5$) is a distractor and is not needed for this calculation method.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Temperature Ratio ($T_1/T_2$):**\n    *   The luminosity formula requires the rest-frame temperatures ($T_1$ and $T_2$).\n    *   From Wien's Law, the temperature ratio is the inverse of the rest-frame wavelength ratio: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{rest,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,1}}$.\n    *   We must find the rest-frame wavelengths using the Doppler effect formula and the fact that the observed wavelengths are equal.\n    *   For Star 1 ($v_1=0$): $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{rest,1} (1 + 0/c) = \\lambda_{rest,1}$.\n    *   For Star 2 ($v_2 = 700$ km/s): $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{rest,2} (1 + v_2/c)$.\n    *   Since $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$, we can state: $\\lambda_{rest,1} = \\lambda_{rest,2} (1 + v_2/c)$.\n    *   Now substitute this into the temperature ratio equation:\n        $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{rest,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,1}} = \\frac{\\lambda_{rest,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,2}(1 + v_2/c)} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n\n6.  **Combine Everything and Compute:**\n    *   Substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio formula:\n        $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}\\right)^4$\n    *   Now, I will use Python to perform the final numerical calculation for high precision.\n\n```python\n# Problem parameters\nradius_ratio = 1.5\nvelocity_star2 = 700 * 1000  # Convert km/s to m/s\nspeed_of_light = 299792458.0  # m/s\n\n# Calculate the square of the radius ratio\nradius_ratio_squared = radius_ratio**2\n\n# Calculate the v/c term\nv_over_c = velocity_star2 / speed_of_light\n\n# Calculate the temperature ratio to the fourth power\n# T1/T2 = 1 / (1 + v/c)\ntemp_ratio_to_the_fourth = (1.0 / (1.0 + v_over_c))**4\n\n# Calculate the final luminosity ratio\nluminosity_ratio = radius_ratio_squared * temp_ratio_to_the_fourth\n\nprint(luminosity_ratio)\n```",
    "The luminosity $L$ of a star radiating as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n$L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\nwhere $R$ is the star's radius, $T$ is its surface temperature, and $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\nThe ratio of the luminosities of Star 1 and Star 2 is:\n$\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = (\\frac{R_1}{R_2})^2 (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4$\n\nWe are given that the radius of Star 1 is 1.5 times the radius of Star 2:\n$\\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5$\nSo, the radius term is:\n$(\\frac{R_1}{R_2})^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25$\n\nNext, we need to find the temperature ratio, $\\frac{T_1}{T_2}$.
