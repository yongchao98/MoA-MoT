    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the allowed transitions based on selection rules.**\n    The problem describes a two-step decay from the |3,0,0⟩ state to the |1,0,0⟩ state via electric dipole transitions. The selection rules for electric dipole (E1) transitions are:\n    *   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, Δl, must be ±1. (Δl = l<sub>final</sub> - l<sub>initial</sub> = ±1)\n    *   The change in the magnetic quantum number, Δm, must be 0 or ±1. (Δm = m<sub>final</sub> - m<sub>initial</sub> = 0, ±1)\n    *   The principal quantum number, n, has no selection rule (Δn can be anything), but for a decay process (spontaneous emission), the energy must decrease, which means n must decrease in the non-relativistic hydrogen atom model where energy E<sub>n</sub> ∝ -1/n<sup>2</sup>.\n\n2.  **Determine the intermediate state.**\n    Let the intermediate state be denoted by |n', l', m'⟩. The process is:\n    |3,0,0⟩ → |n', l', m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n\n    *   **First transition:** |3, l=0, m=0⟩ → |n', l', m'⟩\n        *   Since l=0, for Δl=±1, we must have l'=1.\n        *   For decay, n' < 3.\n        *   The state must exist, so for l'=1, the lowest possible value of n' is 2.\n        *   If n'=1, l' cannot be 1.\n        *   Therefore, the intermediate state must have n'=2 and l'=1.\n        *   Applying the Δm rule: Δm = m' - m = m' - 0 = m'. So, m' can be 0, +1, or -1.\n        *   The possible intermediate states are: |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩.\n\n    *   **Second transition:** |2, l'=1, m'⟩ → |1, l=0, m=0⟩\n        *   Δl = 0 - 1 = -1. This is allowed.\n        *   Δm = 0 - m'. This must be 0, ±1. Since m' can be 0, ±1, this condition is satisfied for all three possible intermediate states.\n\n    This confirms that the decay can proceed through any of the three intermediate states: |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, or |2,1,-1⟩.\n\n3.  **Calculate the probabilities (Branching Ratios).**\n    We need to find the probability of a specific path, for example, the one given in option A: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩. The total probability of this cascade is the product of the branching ratio of the first step and the branching ratio of the second step.\n\n    *   **Probability of the second step:** The intermediate state is |2,1,m'⟩ (a 2p state). The only state with lower energy it can decay to via an electric dipole transition is the |1,0,0⟩ state (1s state). (Decay to |2,0,0⟩ is forbidden because Δl=-1 is required, but l is already 0, and decay to other n=2 states is not possible). Thus, the branching ratio for the decay |2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ is 1 (or 100%).\n\n    *   **Probability of the first step:** We need the branching ratio for the transition |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩. This is the rate of this specific transition divided by the sum of the rates of all possible transitions from |3,0,0⟩ to the n=2, l=1 level.\n        The initial state |3,0,0⟩ (3s state) is spherically symmetric. Due to this symmetry, there is no preferred direction for the emission of the photon.\n        *   A transition to m'=0 (Δm=0) corresponds to emitting a z-polarized photon.\n        *   A transition to m'=±1 (Δm=±1) corresponds to emitting a circularly polarized photon in the x-y plane.\n        Since the initial state has no preferred orientation in space, the probabilities of transitioning to each of the three magnetic sublevels (m' = -1, 0, +1) of the l'=1 state must be equal.\n\n        The total probability of decaying from |3,0,0⟩ to the |2,1, *⟩ level is 1 (considering only this decay channel). This total probability is distributed equally among the three possible final m' states.\n        P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩) = P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩) = P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩)\n        Since the sum of these probabilities is 1, each must be 1/3.\n\n    *   **Total Probability for the Route in option A:**\n        P_total = P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩) × P(|2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩)\n        P_total = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3\n\n4.  **Evaluate the options.**\n    *   A) Route |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and probability 1/3. This matches our calculation.\n    *   B) Route |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and probability 2/3. Incorrect probability.\n    *   C) Route |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and probability 1/4. Incorrect probability (should be 1/3).\n    *   D) Route |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and probability 1/4. Incorrect probability (should be 1/3).\n\nTherefore, option A provides a valid transition route with the correctly calculated probability.\n\n<<<A>>>"
