    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical Principle:** The problem describes the \"excitation\" of atoms in the photospheres of stars. The assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) is key. In LTE, the population of atoms in different energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann distribution.\n\n2.  **The Boltzmann Equation:** The Boltzmann equation relates the number of atoms (N) in two different energy states (let's call them `a` and `b`, where `b` is the higher energy level) to the temperature (T) of the system:\n    N_b / N_a = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-(E_b - E_a) / (k * T)]\n\n    Where:\n    *   `N_b / N_a` is the ratio of the number of atoms in state `b` to state `a`. This ratio represents the level of \"excitation\".\n    *   `g_b / g_a` is the ratio of the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the two states. This is a constant for the specific energy levels of the iron atom.\n    *   `E_b - E_a` is the energy difference between the two states, which we can denote as `ΔE`.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.3806 x 10^-23 J/K).\n    *   `T` is the absolute temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Apply to the Two Stars:** We can write the Boltzmann equation for each star.\n\n    *   For Star 1 (temperature T_1):\n        (N_b / N_a)_1 = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\n\n    *   For Star 2 (temperature T_2):\n        (N_b / N_a)_2 = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n4.  **Use the Information Given in the Problem:** The problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... when compared to the iron atoms in star_2\". This means the ratio of populations is twice as large for star_1 as it is for star_2.\n    (N_b / N_a)_1 = 2 * (N_b / N_a)_2\n\n5.  **Set up the Equation:** Substitute the Boltzmann expressions into the relationship from the previous step:\n    (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n6.  **Simplify the Equation:**\n    *   The term `(g_b / g_a)` appears on both sides, so it cancels out.\n        exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n    *   To solve for the temperatures, take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n        ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]) = ln(2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n\n    *   Using the properties of logarithms (ln(e^x) = x and ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)):\n        -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n        -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\n7.  **Isolate ln(2) and Rearrange:**\n    *   Move the temperature-dependent terms to one side:\n        ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2)\n\n    *   Factor out the common term `ΔE / k`:\n        (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)\n\n    *   Combine the fractions inside the parentheses by finding a common denominator (T_1 * T_2):\n        (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n\n8.  **Evaluate the Pre-factor (ΔE / k):** The problem provides a crucial piece of information: the energy difference `ΔE` is approximately 1.38 x 10^-23 J. The Boltzmann constant `k` is approximately 1.38 x 10^-23 J/K.\n    This choice of value for ΔE is intentional. Let's calculate the pre-factor:\n    (ΔE / k) = (1.38 x 10^-23 J) / (1.38 x 10^-23 J/K) = 1 K.\n\n    This means the dimensionless numerical equations in the options implicitly assume this pre-factor is equal to 1.\n\n9.  **Final Equation:** Substituting the value of `(ΔE / k) = 1` into our derived equation:\n    1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n    ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)\n\n10. **Conclusion:** This result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
