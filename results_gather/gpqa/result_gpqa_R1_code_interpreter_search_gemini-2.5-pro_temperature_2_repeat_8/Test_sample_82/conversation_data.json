    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculations.\n\n### **Part 1: Initial Dilution**\n\n1.  **Calculate initial moles of acetic acid (HAc):**\n    *   Moles = Concentration × Volume\n    *   Moles = 0.05 mol/L × 0.0200 L = 0.001 moles HAc\n\n2.  **Calculate the new concentration after dilution:**\n    *   The initial volume of HAc is 20.00 cm³ (0.0200 L).\n    *   We add 20.00 cm³ of water, so the new total volume is 40.00 cm³ (0.0400 L).\n    *   New Concentration = Moles / New Volume\n    *   New Concentration = 0.001 moles / 0.0400 L = 0.025 M\n\n### **Part 2: pH at 25% Titration**\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (Ac⁻), by the NaOH. This creates a buffer solution.\n\n1.  **Moles at 25% Titration:**\n    *   Moles of HAc remaining = 75% of initial moles = 0.75 × 0.001 = 0.00075 moles\n    *   Moles of Ac⁻ formed = 25% of initial moles = 0.25 × 0.001 = 0.00025 moles\n\n2.  **Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:**\n    *   pH = pKa + log ( [Conjugate Base] / [Weak Acid] )\n    *   pH = pKa + log ( [Ac⁻] / [HAc] )\n\n3.  **Calculate pKa:**\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) = 4.733\n\n4.  **Calculate pH:**\n    *   Since the base and acid are in the same volume, we can use the ratio of their moles.\n    *   pH = 4.733 + log (0.00025 / 0.00075)\n    *   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256\n    *   Rounding gives **pH ≈ 4.26**\n\n### **Part 3: pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form sodium acetate (NaAc). The solution contains only the salt of the weak acid. The acetate ion (Ac⁻) will hydrolyze in water, producing a basic solution.\n\n1.  **Reaction:** HAc + NaOH → NaAc + H₂O\n2.  **Determine volumes and concentrations:**\n    *   Volume of NaOH needed = Moles HAc / [NaOH] = 0.001 moles / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n    *   Total volume at equivalence point = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L\n    *   Concentration of acetate [Ac⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 moles / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M\n\n3.  **Hydrolysis of Acetate (Ac⁻):**\n    *   Ac⁻ + H₂O ⇌ HAc + OH⁻\n4.  **Calculate Kb for acetate:**\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) = 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰\n\n5.  **Calculate [OH⁻] from the hydrolysis equilibrium:**\n    *   Kb = [HAc][OH⁻] / [Ac⁻]\n    *   Let [OH⁻] = x. Then [HAc] = x, and [Ac⁻] = 0.02 - x.\n    *   Since Kb is very small, we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.\n    *   5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ = x² / 0.02\n    *   x² = (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02 = 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) = 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M\n\n6.  **Calculate pOH and pH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) = 5.48\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.48 = **8.52**\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# ---- Constants ----\nKa_HAc = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\ninitial_moles_HAc = 0.05 * 0.020 # mol\nconc_naoh = 0.1 # M\n\n# ---- Part 1: pH at 25% Titration ----\n# At 25% titration, a buffer is formed. pH can be calculated using Henderson-Hasselbalch.\npKa = -math.log10(Ka_HAc)\n# The ratio of [base]/[acid] is 0.25 / 0.75 = 1/3\nratio = 1/3\npH_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(ratio)\n\n# ---- Part 2: pH at Equivalence Point ----\n# At the equivalence point, all HAc is converted to its conjugate base, Acetate (Ac-).\n# Volume of NaOH added to reach equivalence point\nvol_naoh_added = initial_moles_HAc / conc_naoh # L\n\n# Total volume at equivalence point\ninitial_vol_acid = 0.040 # L (after dilution)\ntotal_volume_at_ep = initial_vol_acid + vol_naoh_added # L\n\n# Concentration of Acetate at equivalence point\nconc_Ac_at_ep = initial_moles_HAc / total_volume_at_ep # M\n\n# Acetate hydrolyzes water: Ac- + H2O <-> HAc + OH-\n# We need Kb for Acetate\nKb_Ac = Kw / Ka_HAc\n\n# Solve for [OH-] concentration (x) using the approximation: Kb = x^2 / [Ac-]\n# x = sqrt(Kb * [Ac-])\noh_conc = math.sqrt(Kb_Ac * conc_Ac_at_ep)\n\n# Calculate pOH and then pH\npOH_at_ep = -math.log10(oh_conc)\npH_at_ep = 14.0 - pOH_at_ep\n\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_at_ep:.2f}\")\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem asks for the pH at two different points during the titration of diluted acetic acid with NaOH: at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.\n\n### **Part 1: Initial State After Dilution**\n\nFirst, we determine the concentration of the acetic acid (HAc) solution after it's diluted.\n*   **Initial moles of HAc:** Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.05 M × 0.0200 L = 0.001 moles.\n*   **New volume after dilution:** 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³ = 0.0400 L.\n*   **New concentration of HAc:** Moles / New Volume = 0.001 moles / 0.0400 L = **0.025 M**.\n\n### **Part 2: pH at 25% Titration**\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻ or Ac⁻). This creates a buffer solution containing both the weak acid (HAc) and its conjugate base (Ac⁻).\n\nThe Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used to find the pH of a buffer:\npH = pKa + log ( [Conjugate Base] / [Weak Acid] )\n\n1.  **Calculate pKa:**\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) = 4.733\n\n2.  **Determine the ratio of conjugate base to weak acid:**\n    *   At 25% titration, 25% of HAc is converted to Ac⁻, and 75% of HAc remains.\n    *   Ratio = [Ac⁻] / [HAc] = 25% / 75% = 1/3\n\n3.  **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.733 - 0.477\n    *   **pH ≈ 4.26**\n\n### **Part 3: pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been completely neutralized by NaOH. The solution now contains only the salt, sodium acetate (NaAc), dissolved in water. The acetate ion (Ac⁻) is a weak base and will hydrolyze water, making the solution basic.\n\n1.  **Calculate the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point:**\n    *   Moles of NaOH = Moles of HAc = 0.001 moles.\n    *   Volume of NaOH = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 moles / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³.\n\n2.  **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L.\n\n3.  **Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion ([Ac⁻]):**\n    *   Moles of Ac⁻ formed = Initial moles of HAc = 0.001 moles.\n    *   [Ac⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 moles / 0.0500 L = **0.02 M**.\n\n4.  **Consider the hydrolysis of acetate:**\n    *   Reaction: Ac⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ HAc(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate.\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) = 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰\n\n5.  **Calculate the hydroxide ion concentration [OH⁻]:**\n    *   We set up an equilibrium expression: Kb = [HAc][OH⁻] / [Ac⁻]\n    *   5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    *   Since Kb is very small, we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.\n    *   x² = (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02 = 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) = 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M\n\n6.  **Calculate pOH and then pH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) = 5.48\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = **8.52**\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe pH at 25% titration is **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
