    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the gaseous products and their quantities.**\n\nThe problem states that a 7.20 g mixture of salts A and B is heated and decomposes entirely into a mixture of gases. These gases are then analyzed.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, no such gases were produced.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The mass increase of the tube, 0.80 g, is the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After the three tubes, 2.24 L of a gas C remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP). This gas is inert to the reagents used.\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Given the context of decomposing nitrogen-containing salts, this inert gas is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n\nSo, the decomposition products are: 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.10 mol N₂.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the elemental composition of the original mixture.**\n\nThe atoms in the products must have come from the original salts A and B. Let's calculate the total moles of each element.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All H is in H₂O. Moles of H = 2 × moles of H₂O = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** All N is in N₂. Moles of N = 2 × moles of N₂ = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is in both H₂O and O₂. Moles of O = (1 × moles of H₂O) + (2 × moles of O₂) = (1 × 0.20 mol) + (2 × 0.025 mol) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n\n**Step 3: Verify the conservation of mass.**\n\nLet's calculate the total mass of the elements found and see if it matches the initial mass of the mixture.\n*   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g\n*   Mass of N = 0.20 mol × 14.0 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g\n*   Total mass = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass perfectly, confirming our analysis of the products is correct.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the salts A and B.**\n\nThe problem states we have an **equimolar mixture** of A and B. Let's say we have 'n' moles of A and 'n' moles of B. The total elemental composition of the mixture (2n moles of salt) is 0.40 mol H, 0.20 mol N, and 0.25 mol O.\n\nThe ratio of elements in the combined formulas of (A + B) is:\nH : N : O = 0.40 : 0.20 : 0.25\nTo get integer ratios, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20), which gives H:N:O = 2 : 1 : 1.25. Multiplying by 4 to clear the decimal gives:\n**H : N : O = 8 : 4 : 5**\n\nThis means that one formula unit of salt A plus one formula unit of salt B must contain 8 Hydrogen atoms, 4 Nitrogen atoms, and 5 Oxygen atoms.\n\nThe fact that the salts decompose completely into gases at 200°C strongly suggests they are ammonium salts of nitrogen-based oxyanions. Let's test candidates:\n*   Ammonium nitrite: NH₄NO₂ (Formula: N₂H₄O₂)\n*   Ammonium nitrate: NH₄NO₃ (Formula: N₂H₄O₃)\n\nLet's check if the sum of their formulas matches our derived ratio:\n(N₂H₄O₂) + (N₂H₄O₃) = **N₄H₈O₅**\n\nThis perfectly matches the elemental ratio of N:H:O = 4:8:5. Therefore, salts A and B are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂)** and **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\nWe can also verify the number of moles.\n*   Mass of (NH₄NO₂ + NH₄NO₃) = M(N₂H₄O₂) + M(N₂H₄O₃) = 64.0 g/mol + 80.0 g/mol = 144.0 g/mol for the pair.\n*   Total mass of mixture = n × (M_A + M_B) = n × 144.0 g/mol = 7.20 g\n*   n = 7.20 / 144.0 = 0.05 mol.\n*   So the mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃. This is consistent with our product analysis.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n\nThe final question is for the total number of atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   N: 1 (in NH₄⁺) + 1 (in NO₂⁻) = 2 atoms\n    *   H: 4 atoms\n    *   O: 2 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 2 = **8 atoms**\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   N: 1 (in NH₄⁺) + 1 (in NO₃⁻) = 2 atoms\n    *   H: 4 atoms\n    *   O: 3 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 3 = **9 atoms**\n\n*   **Total number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B)**\n    *   Total = 8 + 9 = **17**\n\nThe total number of atoms in salts A and B is 17.\n\n<<<A>>>"
