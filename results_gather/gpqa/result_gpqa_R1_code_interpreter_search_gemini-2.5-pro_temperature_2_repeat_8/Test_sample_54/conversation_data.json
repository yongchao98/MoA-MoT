    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown organic compound from the given 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's break down the provided information:\n*   **Signal 1:** `7.0 ppm`, Integration: `1H`, Multiplicity: `d` (doublet), Coupling constant: `J = 16.0 Hz`. This signal represents one proton and is in the vinylic region (protons on a C=C double bond). The multiplicity indicates it's coupled to one neighboring proton. The large coupling constant is significant.\n*   **Signal 2:** `5.5 ppm`, Integration: `1H`, Multiplicity: `dq` (doublet of quartets). This is another vinylic proton. The complex multiplicity suggests it's coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons: one proton (giving the doublet) and a group of three protons (giving the quartet).\n*   **Signal 3:** `2.1 ppm`, Integration: `3H`, Multiplicity: `s` (singlet). This signal represents a methyl group (3H) with no adjacent protons. Its chemical shift is characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl (C=O), specifically an acetate group (CH₃-C(=O)O-).\n*   **Signal 4:** `1.6 ppm`, Integration: `3H`, Multiplicity: `d` (doublet). This represents another methyl group. The doublet multiplicity means it is coupled to one adjacent proton.\n\n**2. Determine the Molecular Formula and Basic Structure**\n\n*   **Total Protons:** Summing the integrations (1H + 1H + 3H + 3H) gives a total of 8 protons in the molecule.\n*   **Presence of Acetate Group:** The signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s) strongly indicates an acetate group (CH₃COO-). All four options are acetates, so this is consistent.\n*   **\"Propenyl\" vs. \"Butenyl\":**\n    *   **Propenyl acetate (C₃H₅-O-CO-CH₃):** The molecular formula is C₅H₈O₂. It has 5 protons from the propenyl group and 3 from the acetate group, totaling 8 protons. This matches the integration data.\n    *   **Butenyl acetate (C₄H₇-O-CO-CH₃):** The molecular formula is C₆H₁₀O₂. It has 7 protons from the butenyl group and 3 from the acetate group, totaling 10 protons. This does **not** match the integration data.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound must be a **propenyl acetate**. This eliminates options B (Trans-butenyl acetate) and D (Cis-butenyl acetate).\n\n**3. Distinguish between Cis and Trans Isomers**\n\nWe are left with two possibilities: Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate. The key to distinguishing them lies in the coupling constant (J-value) between the two vinylic protons (the ones on the C=C double bond).\n\n*   **General Rule for Vinylic Coupling:**\n    *   **Trans-coupling (J_trans):** Protons are on opposite sides of the double bond. The coupling constant is typically large, ranging from **12-18 Hz**.\n    *   **Cis-coupling (J_cis):** Protons are on the same side of the double bond. The coupling constant is smaller, ranging from **6-12 Hz**.\n\n*   **Applying the Rule:**\n    *   The data provides a signal at 7.0 ppm with a coupling constant **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n    *   This value falls squarely in the range for a **trans** configuration.\n\n**4. Assemble the Full Structure and Assign the Peaks**\n\nLet's draw Trans-propenyl acetate and see if all the data fits.\n\n**Structure of Trans-propenyl acetate:**\n```\n        H(b)      O-CO-CH₃(d)\n         \\         /\n          C = C\n         /     \\\n  H₃C(c)        H(a)\n```\n\n*   **Protons H(d):** The acetate methyl group. It has no adjacent protons.\n    *   Expected: 3H, singlet (s), ~2.1 ppm.\n    *   **Matches:** `2.1 ppm (3H, s)`.\n*   **Protons H(a) and H(b):** The vinylic protons on the double bond. They are coupled to each other.\n    *   H(a) is attached to the carbon bonded to the electron-withdrawing oxygen, so it will be the most downfield (highest ppm). It is coupled to one proton, H(b), so it will be a doublet.\n    *   Expected for H(a): 1H, doublet (d), downfield.\n    *   **Matches:** `7.0 ppm (1H, d)`. The coupling constant with H(b) is J = 16.0 Hz, confirming the trans geometry.\n    *   H(b) is coupled to H(a) (1 proton, creating a doublet) and the three H(c) protons (creating a quartet). Thus, H(b) will be a doublet of quartets (dq).\n    *   Expected for H(b): 1H, doublet of quartets (dq), between H(a) and H(c).\n    *   **Matches:** `5.5 ppm (1H, dq)`.\n*   **Protons H(c):** The methyl group on the double bond. It is coupled to one proton, H(b).\n    *   Expected: 3H, doublet (d), ~1.6-1.8 ppm.\n    *   **Matches:** `1.6 ppm (3H, d)`.\n\nThe provided 1H NMR data perfectly matches the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate in every aspect: chemical shift, integration, multiplicity, and coupling constant.\n\n<<<C>>>"
