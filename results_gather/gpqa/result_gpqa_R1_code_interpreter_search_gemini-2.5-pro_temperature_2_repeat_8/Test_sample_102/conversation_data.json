    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\nLet's break down its structure:\n*   It is a benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   The parent structure is acetophenone (a benzene ring with an acetyl group, -COCH3). Let's place this at position 1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) is at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) is at position 5.\n\nThe substitution pattern is 1, 3, 5. All substituents are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nTo plan the synthesis, we must consider how each group directs incoming electrophiles during Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS).\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** A deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** A deactivating group and an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** A strongly deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n\nA key reaction in these sequences is the **Friedel-Crafts acylation** (to add the -COCH3 group). A critical rule for this reaction is that it **fails on strongly deactivated rings**, particularly those substituted with a nitro group (-NO2). This implies that the acetyl group must be introduced *before* the nitro group.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options**\n\nLet's examine each option based on these principles.\n\n*   **Option A: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4**\n    *   The sequence begins with nitration (i), making nitrobenzene.\n    *   It then attempts acylation (vi) *after* bromination (v), on bromobenzene. This would produce mainly *para*-bromoacetophenone (4-bromoacetophenone), not the *meta* isomer needed.\n    *   The overall sequence is illogical and leads to the wrong isomer. Steps (i) to (iv) are a roundabout way of converting benzene to benzene, which makes no sense.\n\n*   **Option B: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n    *   The sequence starts with nitration to form nitrobenzene (i), then reduction to aniline (ii).\n    *   Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the amino group (-NH2) is a Lewis base that reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), deactivating the ring and inhibiting the reaction.\n    *   Therefore, this sequence is not viable.\n\n*   **Option D: i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) Fe/HCl ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n    *   This sequence starts by making bromobenzene (i), then p-bromonitrobenzene (ii).\n    *   Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on p-bromonitrobenzene. The presence of the strongly deactivating nitro group prevents this reaction from occurring.\n    *   Therefore, this sequence is not viable.\n\n*   **Option C: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n    *   Let's analyze the steps sequentially:\n        1.  **i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 on benzene:** This is Friedel-Crafts acylation, which forms **acetophenone**. The -COCH3 group is a meta-director. This is a good starting point.\n        2.  **ii) Br2/FeBr3 on acetophenone:** This is bromination. The meta-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to position 3, forming **3-bromoacetophenone**. This establishes the required 1,3-relationship between the acetyl and bromo groups.\n        3.  **iii) HNO3/H2SO4 on 3-bromoacetophenone:** This is nitration. We need to add the -NO2 group at position 5. Let's look at the directing effects in 3-bromoacetophenone:\n            *   The -COCH3 group (at 1) is a meta-director, directing the -NO2 group to position 5.\n            *   The -Br group (at 3) is an ortho, para-director, directing the -NO2 group to positions 2, 4, and 6 on the ring.\n            *   Although the directors are in conflict, it is known experimentally that nitration occurs preferentially at position 5, which is meta to both existing deactivating groups, likely because this position is sterically accessible and electronically least disfavored. This reaction gives the desired product, **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**, in high yield.\n    *   The first three steps of this sequence constitute a logical and high-yield synthesis of the target molecule. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) seem illogical and extraneous (e.g., reducing a nitro group that was just added, followed by another nitration). They are likely included in error in the problem statement.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy eliminating options A, B, and D based on fundamental chemical principles, we are left with C. The first three steps of sequence C provide a chemically sound and efficient route to the target product. Therefore, C is the best choice among the given options.\n\n<<<C>>>"
