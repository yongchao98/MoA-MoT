    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Express the Potential in Cartesian Coordinates**\n\nThe problem provides the potential in polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$:\n$V(r, \\theta) = \\frac{1}{2} k r^2 + \\frac{3}{2} k r^2 \\cos^2(\\theta)$\n\nTo simplify the problem, we convert the potential to Cartesian coordinates $(x, y)$. The transformation equations are:\n$x = r \\cos(\\theta)$\n$y = r \\sin(\\theta)$\n$r^2 = x^2 + y^2$\n\nSubstitute these into the potential expression:\n$V(x, y) = \\frac{1}{2} k (x^2 + y^2) + \\frac{3}{2} k (r \\cos(\\theta))^2$\n$V(x, y) = \\frac{1}{2} k (x^2 + y^2) + \\frac{3}{2} k x^2$\n\nNow, group the terms with $x^2$ and $y^2$:\n$V(x, y) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} k + \\frac{3}{2} k\\right) x^2 + \\frac{1}{2} k y^2$\n$V(x, y) = \\left(\\frac{4}{2} k\\right) x^2 + \\frac{1}{2} k y^2$\n$V(x, y) = 2 k x^2 + \\frac{1}{2} k y^2$\n\n**2. Identify the System as Two Independent Harmonic Oscillators**\n\nThe potential in Cartesian coordinates, $V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + \\frac{1}{2}ky^2$, is a sum of two independent potentials, one for the x-direction and one for the y-direction:\n$V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)$\nwhere:\n$V_x(x) = 2kx^2$\n$V_y(y) = \\frac{1}{2}ky^2$\n\nEach of these potentials corresponds to a one-dimensional simple harmonic oscillator. The general form for the potential energy of a simple harmonic oscillator is $V(z) = \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2z^2$. The Schrödinger equation for this 2D system is separable, meaning we can solve for the energy contributions from the x and y motions independently.\n\n**3. Determine the Angular Frequencies ($\\omega_x$ and $\\omega_y$)**\n\nWe compare the potential terms with the general form to find the angular frequencies for the x and y oscillations.\n\nFor the x-direction:\n$V_x(x) = 2kx^2 = \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega_x^2 x^2$\nSolving for $\\omega_x$:\n$4k = m\\omega_x^2 \\implies \\omega_x^2 = \\frac{4k}{m} \\implies \\omega_x = \\sqrt{\\frac{4k}{m}} = 2\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n\nFor the y-direction:\n$V_y(y) = \\frac{1}{2}ky^2 = \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega_y^2 y^2$\nSolving for $\\omega_y$:\n$k = m\\omega_y^2 \\implies \\omega_y^2 = \\frac{k}{m} \\implies \\omega_y = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n\n**4. Find the Total Energy Spectrum**\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator are given by the formula $E_n = (n + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n$ is a non-negative integer ($n = 0, 1, 2, ...$).\n\nSince our 2D system consists of two independent harmonic oscillators, the total energy $E$ is the sum of the energies from the x and y motions:\n$E = E_x + E_y = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega_x + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega_y$\n\nNow, substitute the frequencies $\\omega_x$ and $\\omega_y$ we found:\n$E = \\left(n_x + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\hbar \\left(2\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}\\right) + \\left(n_y + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\hbar \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}\\right)$\n\n**5. Simplify the Energy Expression**\n\nFactor out the common term $\\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$:\n$E = \\left[ 2\\left(n_x + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\left(n_y + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\right] \\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n\nDistribute the constants inside the brackets:\n$E = \\left[ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + \\frac{1}{2} \\right] \\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n\nCombine the constant terms:\n$E = \\left( 2n_x + n_y + \\frac{3}{2} \\right) \\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n\n**6. Compare with the Options**\n\nThe calculated energy spectrum is $E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) \\hbar\\sqrt{k/m}$. Comparing this with the given choices:\n\nA) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nB) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nC) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nD) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\n\nThe result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
