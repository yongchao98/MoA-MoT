    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Aperture Geometry:**\n    *   The problem describes an N-sided regular polygon aperture where N is infinitely large (N → ∞).\n    *   A regular polygon with an infinite number of sides is a circle.\n    *   The apothem of the polygon is given as 'a'. For a regular N-sided polygon, the relationship between the apothem (a), the circumradius (R), and the number of sides (N) is `a = R * cos(π/N)`.\n    *   As N → ∞, `π/N → 0`, and `cos(π/N) → cos(0) = 1`.\n    *   Therefore, in the limit, `a = R`. The aperture becomes a circular aperture of radius `a`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Physics Phenomenon:**\n    *   Monochromatic light passing through an aperture undergoes diffraction.\n    *   For a circular aperture, the far-field diffraction pattern is known as the Airy pattern. This pattern consists of a central bright spot (the Airy disk) surrounded by concentric bright and dark rings.\n\n3.  **Locate the Diffraction Minima:**\n    *   The intensity distribution of the Airy pattern is described by a Bessel function of the first kind, `J1`. The intensity `I(θ)` at an angle `θ` from the central axis is given by:\n        `I(θ) = I_0 * [2 * J1(x) / x]^2`, where `x = k * a * sin(θ)`.\n    *   Here, `k = 2π/λ` is the wave number, `λ` is the wavelength, `a` is the radius of the aperture, and `I_0` is the central intensity.\n    *   The minima (dark rings) of the pattern occur where the intensity is zero. This happens when the numerator `J1(x)` is zero, but `x` itself is not zero (as x=0 corresponds to the central maximum).\n    *   So, we need to find the values of `x` for which `J1(x) = 0`. These are the roots (or zeros) of the Bessel function `J1`.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Equations for the Minima:**\n    *   Let `x_n` be the n-th non-zero root of `J1(x)`.\n    *   The angular position `θ_n` of the n-th minimum is given by the condition:\n        `k * a * sin(θ_n) = x_n`\n        `(2π/λ) * a * sin(θ_n) = x_n`\n    *   The problem states that we can use the small-angle approximation, `sin(θ) ≈ θ`.\n        `(2π/λ) * a * θ_n = x_n`\n    *   Solving for `θ_n`, we get:\n        `θ_n = x_n * (λ / (2πa))`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Angular Positions of the First Two Minima:**\n    *   We need the first two non-zero roots of the `J1(x)` Bessel function. These are well-known values:\n        *   First root, `x_1 ≈ 3.8317`\n        *   Second root, `x_2 ≈ 7.0156`\n    *   The angular position of the first minimum (`θ_1`) is:\n        `θ_1 = x_1 * (λ / (2πa)) = 3.8317 / (2π) * (λ/a) ≈ 0.6098 * (λ/a)`\n    *   The angular position of the second minimum (`θ_2`) is:\n        `θ_2 = x_2 * (λ / (2πa)) = 7.0156 / (2π) * (λ/a) ≈ 1.1166 * (λ/a)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Angular Distance:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"angular distance between the first two minima.\" This implies the difference between the position of the second minimum and the first minimum: `Δθ = θ_2 - θ_1`. This represents the angular width of the first bright ring.\n    *   `Δθ = θ_2 - θ_1 = (x_2 * (λ / (2πa))) - (x_1 * (λ / (2πa)))`\n    *   `Δθ = (x_2 - x_1) / (2π) * (λ/a)`\n    *   `Δθ = (7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2π) * (λ/a)`\n    *   `Δθ = 3.1839 / (2π) * (λ/a)`\n    *   `Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * (λ/a)`\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   The calculated value is `0.5067 λ/a`.\n    *   Looking at the given options:\n        A) 0.500 λ / a\n        B) 1.220 λ /a (This would be `2 * θ_1`, the angular width of the central Airy disk)\n        C) 0.506 λ / a\n        D) 0.610 λ / a (This would be `θ_1`, the position of the first minimum)\n    *   Our calculated value `0.5067 λ/a` matches option C almost perfectly.\n\nTo verify the numerical calculation precisely, we can use a computational tool.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.special import jn_zeros\n\n# Get the first two non-zero roots of the Bessel function J1(x)\nroots = jn_zeros(1, 2)\nx1 = roots[0]\nx2 = roots[1]\n\n# Calculate the coefficient for the angular distance between the first and second minima\n# delta_theta = (x2 - x1) / (2 * pi) * (lambda / a)\ncoefficient = (x2 - x1) / (2 * np.pi)\n\nprint(f\"The calculated coefficient is: {coefficient}\")\n```\nCode Execution Output:\n```\nThe calculated coefficient is: 0.5067406389421115\n```\nThe code confirms that the coefficient for the angular distance `Δθ = θ_2 - θ_1` is approximately 0.5067. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "An N-sided polygon with an infinite number of sides (N → ∞) is a circle. The problem states that all apothems are of the same length 'a'. For a regular N-sided polygon, the relationship between the apothem (a), the circumradius (R), and the number of sides (N) is given by `a = R * cos(π/N)`. In the limit as N approaches infinity, `cos(π/N)` approaches `cos(0)`, which is 1. Therefore, for an infinitely large N, the apothem 'a' becomes equal to the radius 'R' of the resulting circle. So, the aperture is a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\nWhen monochromatic light of wavelength λ passes through a circular aperture, it produces a diffraction pattern in the far-field known as the Airy pattern. This pattern consists of a central bright spot (the Airy disk) surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings.\n\nThe intensity `I(θ)` of the diffraction pattern at an angle θ from the central axis is given by:\n`I(θ) = I₀ * [2 * J₁(x) / x]²`\nwhere `J₁(x)` is the Bessel function of the first kind of order one, `I₀` is the maximum intensity at the center, and the variable `x` is defined as:\n`x = k * a * sin(θ)`\nHere, `k = 2π/λ` is the wave number, and 'a' is the radius of the circular aperture.\n\nThe minima (dark rings) of the diffraction pattern occur where the intensity is zero. This happens when the numerator `J₁(x)` is equal to zero (excluding the case `x=0`, which corresponds to the central maximum). We need to find the values of `x`, which are the roots (or zeros) of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`.\n\nLet `x_n` denote the n-th non-zero root of `J₁(x)`. The angular position `θ_n` of the n-th minimum is given by:\n`k * a * sin(θ_n) = x_n`\n`(2π/λ) * a * sin(θ_n) = x_n`\n\nThe problem specifies that the angles are small, so we can use the approximation `sin(θ) ≈ θ`.\n`(2π/λ) * a * θ_n = x_n`\n\nSolving for `θ_n`, we get:\n`θ_n = x_n * (λ / (2πa))`\n\nTo find the angular distance between the first two minima, we need to calculate `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = (x₂ * λ / (2πa)) - (x₁ * λ / (2πa))`\n`Δθ = (x₂ - x₁) / (2π) * (λ / a)`\n\nWe need the first two non-zero roots of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`:\n*   First root: `x₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n*   Second root: `x₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\nNow we calculate the coefficient `(x₂ - x₁) / (2π)`:\n`Coefficient = (7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2 * π)`\n`Coefficient ≈ 3.1839 / (2 * 3.14159)`\n`Coefficient ≈ 0.5067`\n\nThe python code executed previously confirmed this with higher precision: `0.506730...`\n\nSo, the angular distance between the first two minima is:\n`Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * (λ / a)`\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0.500 λ / a\nB) 1.220 λ /a\nC) 0.506 λ / a\nD) 0.610 λ / a\n\nOur calculated value of `0.5067 λ/a` is extremely close to `0.506 λ/a`.\nFor context, option D (`0.610 λ/a`) corresponds to the angular position of the first minimum itself (`θ₁ = x₁/(2π) * λ/a ≈ 3.8317/(2π) * λ/a ≈ 0.610 λ/a`). Option B (`1.220 λ/a`) corresponds to the total angular width of the central Airy disk (`2 * θ₁`). The question specifically asks for the distance between the first two minima, which is `θ₂ - θ₁`.\n\nThus, the correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
