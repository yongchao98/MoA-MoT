    "Optical isomerism is a property of chiral compounds. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. We need to analyze each of the given compounds to determine if they are chiral.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:\n    *   This is a substituted biphenyl derivative. Certain substituted biphenyls can exhibit a form of chirality called **atropisomerism**. This occurs when the rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is sterically hindered by bulky substituents in the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6').\n    *   In this molecule, all four ortho positions are substituted with bulky groups: two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH3) at positions 2 and 2', and two nitro groups (-NO2) at positions 6 and 6'. This steric hindrance prevents free rotation around the biphenyl bond, locking the rings in a non-planar conformation.\n    *   For the molecule to be chiral, it must also lack a plane of symmetry. Each ring is substituted with two different groups (-COOCH3 and -NO2). Because of this asymmetric substitution and the locked conformation, the molecule as a whole lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion.\n    *   Therefore, it is a chiral molecule and exists as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers). It exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   This compound is an ester, also known as methyl lactate. Its structural formula is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   To check for chirality, we look for a chiral center, which is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bearing the -OH group). It is bonded to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since all four groups attached to this carbon are different, it is a chiral center. A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**:\n    *   The structure of benzophenone is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. It consists of a central carbonyl group bonded to two phenyl rings.\n    *   The central carbon is sp² hybridized and bonded to only three groups. There are no chiral centers in the molecule.\n    *   The molecule possesses a C₂ axis of symmetry and a plane of symmetry that bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. Any molecule that has a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   Since it is achiral, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**:\n    *   This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans* isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is *trans*-CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   This molecule is planar. It possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and a center of inversion located at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n    *   The presence of either a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion makes a molecule achiral.\n    *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nOnly compounds **1** (dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate) and **2** (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) are chiral and thus show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<D>>>"
