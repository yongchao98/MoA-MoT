    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning process to determine the correct statement:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Chemical Problem:** The goal is to produce polyethylene with regular branches using only ethylene as the monomer. This is a well-known process in polymer chemistry called tandem catalysis or in-situ comonomer generation. It works in two main steps that occur simultaneously in the same reactor:\n    *   **Step 1 (Oligomerization):** A first catalyst selectively oligomerizes ethylene into a specific short alpha-olefin. For example, it can trimerize three ethylene units into one molecule of 1-hexene (C6H12). This is the \"essential additional reaction step\" that creates the comonomer.\n    *   **Step 2 (Copolymerization):** A second catalyst copolymerizes ethylene with the newly formed 1-hexene. This incorporates the 1-hexene into the growing polymer chain as a regular C4 (butyl) branch. The resulting polymer is a type of linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE).\n\n2.  **Evaluate Each Statement:**\n\n    *   **A) Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.**\n        This type of tandem catalysis is a major innovation in the polymer industry. Companies like Univation Technologies, a joint venture of Dow and ExxonMobil based in the USA, have commercialized this technology (e.g., for their UNIPOL™ PE Process). It is used to produce LLDPE on a large, industrial scale. Therefore, this statement is **factually correct**.\n\n    *   **B) Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.**\n        The \"essential additional reaction step\" is the selective oligomerization (e.g., trimerization to 1-hexene). The catalysts for this reaction, particularly the highly successful chromium-based ones, require a cocatalyst or activator to function. The most common activators used are aluminum alkyls, specifically methylaluminoxane (MAO) or modified methylaluminoxane (MMAO). Since these essential activators are aluminum-based, the statement that aluminum-based activators \"do not work\" is **factually incorrect**.\n\n    *   **C) One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.**\n        Group VIa of the periodic table is now more commonly called Group 6. It contains Chromium (Cr), Molybdenum (Mo), and Tungsten (W). The breakthrough for selective ethylene oligomerization came from the development of specific chromium-based catalyst systems. These Cr catalysts are extremely effective at trimerizing ethylene to 1-hexene or tetramerizing it to 1-octene, which are the ideal comonomers for this process. Therefore, using a Group VIa metal catalyst is a cornerstone of this technology. This statement is **factually correct**.\n\n    *   **D) Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.**\n        Noble metals (like palladium, platinum, rhodium) are generally in Groups 8-11. While some late transition metal catalysts (like certain nickel or palladium systems) can polymerize or oligomerize ethylene, they are not known for the highly selective formation of a single alpha-olefin like 1-hexene, which is required to create *regular* branches. The catalysts known for this specific task are primarily based on chromium, titanium, or zirconium. So, the claim that noble metals \"can be used\" for this specific purpose is dubious, and they are not the industrially or academically recognized solution. This statement is at best misleading and likely **incorrect** in this specific context.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n    We have identified two factually correct statements: A and C. However, in multiple-choice questions of this nature, we must select the single best answer.\n    *   Statement A is a correct statement about the commercial status and geographical implementation of the technology.\n    *   Statement C is a correct statement about the fundamental chemistry and the specific type of catalyst that makes the technology possible.\n\n    The question is asked from the perspective of a scientist looking to perform a reaction. Statement C provides a crucial piece of chemical information about *how* to perform the reaction (\"use a Group VIa metal\"), which is directly relevant to the experimental design. Statement A provides commercial context. In a scientific question about a chemical transformation, the statement describing the core chemical principle (C) is the most relevant and appropriate answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
