These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions.

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning for each reaction:\n\n### Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, `CH2(COOCH3)2`. The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), deprotonates the highly acidic α-carbon between the two ester groups to form a resonance-stabilized enolate, `[-]CH(COOCH3)2`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH3`. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The β-carbon is the electrophilic site for conjugate addition.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism (Michael Addition):**\n    *   The dimethyl malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   This forms a new carbon-carbon bond between the α-carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The reaction mixture is then protonated (e.g., by the solvent EtOH or during acidic workup) to give the neutral adduct.\n\n3.  **Predict the Product Structure:**\n    *   The nucleophilic carbon from the malonate, `-CH(COOCH3)2`, adds to the β-carbon (`CH` attached to the p-tolyl group) of the acrylate.\n    *   The initial acrylate `p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH3` becomes `p-Tolyl-CH(Nu)-CH2-COOCH3`, where `Nu` is the malonate part.\n    *   The final structure is `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH3)2)-CH2-COOCH3`.\n\n4.  **Name the Product (A):**\n    *   Let's name this molecule systematically using IUPAC rules. We can consider it as a substituted propane tricarboxylate.\n    *   The main carbon chain can be identified as `(MeOOC)2C(1)-C(2)H(p-tolyl)-C(3)H2(COOMe)`.\n    *   This is a propane chain with ester groups at positions 1, 1, and 3, and a p-tolyl group at position 2.\n    *   The systematic name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)\n\n1.  **Identify the Donor and Acceptor (Stork Enamine Synthesis):**\n    *   **Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine derived from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are nitrogen analogs of enols and are nucleophilic at the β-carbon (the C2 of the cyclohexene ring).\n    *   **Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), `CH3-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon is the electrophilic site.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   This is a Stork enamine acylation, a variant of the Michael addition. The enamine's nucleophilic β-carbon attacks the acceptor's β-carbon.\n    *   This forms an initial adduct which is an iminium ion.\n    *   The addition of aqueous acid (`H3O+`) in the workup step hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group.\n\n3.  **Predict the Product Structure (B):**\n    *   The C-C bond forms between C2 of the cyclohexanone precursor and the β-carbon (`CH` with the methyl group) of the butenenitrile.\n    *   The starting cyclohexanone ring becomes alkylated at its α-position (C2).\n    *   The substituent added is `-[CH(CH3)-CH2-CN]`.\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexanone ring with a `-(CH(CH3)-CH2-CN)` group at C2.\n    *   Let's name the molecule. It can be named as a substituted butanenitrile. The main chain is `C(N)-C(2)H2-C(3)H(Substituent)-C(4)H3`. The substituent is a `(2-oxocyclohexyl)` group attached to C3 of the butanenitrile chain.\n    *   The systematic name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The alternative option, the enol form `3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`, is less stable than the keto form and would not be considered the major final product after an acidic workup.\n\n### Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction (Retrosynthesis):**\n    *   This is a Michael addition where we need to find the starting nucleophile (C).\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Acceptor (Electrophile):** but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), `CH2=CH-CO-CH3`.\n    *   **Reagents:** KOH in H2O, indicating a base-catalyzed reaction where the base generates the nucleophile by deprotonation.\n\n2.  **Identify the Bond Formed:**\n    *   The Michael addition adds a nucleophile to the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated system. For MVK, the β-carbon is the terminal `CH2`.\n    *   After addition and protonation, the `CH2=CH-CO-CH3` moiety becomes `Nu-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3`.\n    *   In the product, `2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`, the `(3-oxobutyl)` group is `-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3`.\n    *   This means the nucleophile `Nu-` that added to MVK is the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring, attached at its C2 position.\n\n3.  **Determine Reactant C:**\n    *   The hydrogen at C2 of `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` is located between two carbonyl groups, making it particularly acidic (pKa ≈ 11).\n    *   The base, KOH, can easily deprotonate this C-H bond to form a stable enolate ion.\n    *   This enolate ion is the nucleophile that attacks MVK.\n    *   Therefore, reactant **C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of all three reactions:\n*   **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**\n*   **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**\n*   **C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\nThis combination corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
