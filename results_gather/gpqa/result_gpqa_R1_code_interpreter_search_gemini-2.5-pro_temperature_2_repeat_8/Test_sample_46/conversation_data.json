    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n\n*   The molecular formula is C9H11NO2.\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation is calculated as:\n    DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   A DoU of 5 is highly suggestive of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional double bond (1 degree), which is likely a carbonyl group (C=O) given the presence of oxygen.\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** The presence of two distinct peaks in this region is a classic indicator of a primary amine (-NH2). These correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The frequency is in the typical range for an ester, especially one that is conjugated with an aromatic ring. It is generally too high for an amide C=O (which usually appears below 1700 cm⁻¹).\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is the signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring. The large difference in their chemical shifts indicates that one substituent is strongly electron-donating (shielding its ortho protons) and the other is strongly electron-withdrawing (deshielding its ortho protons).\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination of a triplet (3H) and a quartet (2H) is the unmistakable pattern of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The quartet at a high chemical shift (4.5 ppm) means the -CH2- group is attached to a very electronegative atom, almost certainly an oxygen. This confirms the presence of an ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet, integrating to 2 protons, confirms the presence of the primary amine (-NH2) group seen in the IR spectrum. The broadening is common for amine protons due to exchange and quadrupolar relaxation.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure:**\n\n*   From the DoU and NMR, we have a **para-substituted benzene ring**.\n*   One substituent is a **primary amine (-NH2)**.\n*   From the IR and NMR, we have an **ester C=O** and an **ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3)**. This combines to form an ethyl ester group, **-COOCH2CH3**.\n\nPutting these fragments together on a para-substituted benzene ring, the structure must be **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this structure against the data:\n*   **Structure:** H2N-C6H4-COOCH2CH3\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2 (Correct)\n*   **IR:** Has an -NH2 group and a conjugated ester C=O. (Correct)\n*   **¹H NMR:**\n    *   An ethoxy group gives a triplet at ~1.2 ppm and a quartet at ~4.5 ppm. (Correct)\n    *   A primary amine gives a broad 2H signal. (Correct, at 4.0 ppm)\n    *   A para-substituted ring with a donating group (-NH2) and a withdrawing group (-COOEt). The protons ortho to the donating -NH2 will be upfield (observed at 7.0 ppm). The protons ortho to the withdrawing -COOEt will be downfield (observed at 8.0 ppm). (Correct)\n\n**5. Evaluating other options:**\n\n*   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect substitution pattern (meta) and incorrect functional group (amide instead of ester).\n*   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect ester structure. The quartet for -C(=O)CH2- would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR (shows a primary amine) and the NMR (shows a -NH2, not a -NH-).\n\nThe only candidate that perfectly matches all the provided spectral data is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>"
