    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reactants:** (E)-oct-4-ene (a trans-alkene) is treated first with mCPBA and then with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This two-step sequence is a classic method for the *anti-dihydroxylation* of an alkene. The first step, epoxidation with mCPBA, is a *syn-addition*. The second step, acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide by water, is an *anti-addition* (an Sₙ2-type attack). The net result of adding two -OH groups across the double bond is *anti*.\n*   **Stereochemistry Rule:** For a symmetrically substituted alkene, the stereochemical outcome follows a well-known rule: **trans-alkene + anti-addition → meso compound**.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** (E)-oct-4-ene is a trans-alkene. Undergoing anti-dihydroxylation, it will yield a single product: the meso compound, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. A meso compound has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reactants:** (Z)-oct-4-ene (a cis-alkene) is treated with the same sequence of reagents.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is also an *anti-dihydroxylation*.\n*   **Stereochemistry Rule:** The rule for a cis-alkene is: **cis-alkene + anti-addition → racemic mixture of enantiomers**.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is a cis-alkene. Undergoing anti-dihydroxylation, it will yield a 1:1 mixture of two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 3: Characterize the Final Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products of both reactions. The final mixture contains three different molecules, which are all stereoisomers of octane-4,5-diol:\n1.  **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the meso compound, let's call it **M**).\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (one enantiomer, let's call it **R**).\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the other enantiomer, let's call it **S**).\n\nThe relationships between these isomers are:\n*   **R** and **S** are enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   **M** is a diastereomer of **R**.\n*   **M** is a diastereomer of **S**.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the Chromatogram for Standard (Achiral) HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle of Separation:** Standard HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity, size, boiling point). The stationary phase is achiral.\n*   **Separating Stereoisomers:**\n    *   **Enantiomers (R and S)** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they will interact with the achiral stationary phase in the exact same way and will have the same retention time. They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers (M vs. R, and M vs. S)** have different physical properties. Therefore, the meso compound **M** will interact with the stationary phase differently than the enantiomeric pair (**R**+**S**) and will have a different retention time.\n*   **Conclusion:** The achiral HPLC will show **two peaks**: one for the meso compound (**M**) and one for the co-eluting enantiomers (**R**+**S**).\n\n### **Step 5: Predict the Chromatogram for Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle of Separation:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. This creates a chiral environment that allows for the differentiation of enantiomers.\n*   **Separating Stereoisomers:**\n    *   The chiral stationary phase interacts with the two enantiomers (**R** and **S**) to form temporary diastereomeric complexes. Since these complexes have different energies and stabilities, the enantiomers will have different retention times and will be separated into two distinct peaks.\n    *   The meso compound (**M**) is a diastereomer of **R** and **S**. As diastereomers have different physical properties, **M** will also be separated from both **R** and **S**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The chiral HPLC will be able to resolve all three stereoisomers. It will show **three peaks**: one for compound **M**, one for compound **R**, and one for compound **S**.\n\n### **Final Summary**\n\n*   **Standard HPLC:** 2 peaks.\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 3 peaks.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
