    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the potential energy of the system.\n\n**1. Understand the Setup**\nWe have a system consisting of:\n*   A point charge `q`.\n*   A grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. \"Grounded\" means its electric potential is held at zero (V=0).\n*   The distance from the center of the sphere to the point charge is `d`, where `d > R`.\n\n**2. The Method of Images**\nTo solve this problem, we use the method of images. This powerful technique allows us to replace the complex problem of a charge and a conductor with a simpler problem involving only point charges.\n\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the electric field *outside* the sphere is identical to the field produced by:\n*   The original charge `q` at distance `d`.\n*   An \"image charge\" `q'` placed *inside* the sphere.\n\nThe properties of this image charge are chosen such that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero. These properties are:\n*   **Magnitude of the image charge:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Position of the image charge:** `b = R^2 / d` (measured from the center, on the same line as the original charge).\n\n**3. Calculating the Potential Energy**\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. The force acting on the charge `q` is the attractive force from the induced charges on the sphere's surface. According to the method of images, this force is exactly the same as the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\nThere are two common ways to calculate this energy.\n\n**Method 1: Integrating the Force**\nThe work `W` done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity (`x = ∞`) to the distance `d` is equal to the potential energy `U`. This work is the negative of the work done by the electric field.\n\n`U = W = - ∫[∞→d] F(x) ⋅ dx = ∫[d→∞] F(x) dx`\n\nHere, `F(x)` is the electrostatic force on the charge `q` when it is at a distance `x` from the center. This force is due to the image charge `q'(x) = -qR/x` located at `b(x) = R²/x`.\n\n*   The distance between `q` (at `x`) and `q'` (at `b`) is `x - b = x - R²/x`.\n*   The force is `F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (x - b(x))²`\n    `F(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R²/x)²`\n    `F(x) = -kq²R/x / ((x²-R²)/x)² = -kq²R/x * x²/(x²-R²)² = -kq²Rx / (x²-R²)²`\n\nNow, we integrate this force:\n`U = ∫[d→∞] (-kq²Rx / (x²-R²)²) dx`\n`U = -kq²R ∫[d→∞] (x / (x²-R²)²) dx`\n\nTo solve the integral, we use the substitution `u = x² - R²`, which gives `du = 2x dx`, or `x dx = du/2`.\nThe limits of integration change from `x=d` to `u = d²-R²` and `x→∞` to `u→∞`.\n\n`U = -kq²R ∫[d²-R²→∞] (1/u²) (du/2)`\n`U = -(kq²R/2) * [ -1/u ]_[d²-R²→∞]`\n`U = -(kq²R/2) * [ (lim u→∞ -1/u) - (-1/(d²-R²)) ]`\n`U = -(kq²R/2) * [ 0 + 1/(d²-R²) ]`\n`U = - (1/2) * kq²R / (d²-R²)`\n\n**Method 2: Using Potential Energy Formula (with a subtlety)**\nThe potential energy of the interaction is `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the final location of charge `q` created by all *other* charges (i.e., the induced charge on the sphere). The factor of 1/2 is crucial and arises because the induced charge itself is created by the presence of `q`, so we must average over the charging process.\n\n*   `V_induced` is the potential at distance `d` from the center, caused by the image charge `q'` at position `b`.\n*   The distance between the final position of `q` and the image charge `q'` is `d - b = d - R²/d = (d² - R²)/d`.\n*   `q' = -qR/d`.\n*   `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n    `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d² - R²)/d)`\n    `V_induced = -kqR / (d² - R²)`\n\nNow, calculate the energy:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n`U = (1/2) * q * [ -kqR / (d²-R²) ]`\n`U = - (1/2) * kq²R / (d²-R²)`\n\n**Conclusion**\nBoth methods yield the same result. The net potential energy of the system is `U = - (1/2) * kq²R / (d² - R²)`. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
