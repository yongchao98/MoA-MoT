    "*   **Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis**:\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotopes.\n    *   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with a relative intensity of 32%. The mass difference of 2 amu (158 - 156) and the intensity ratio of the M+2 peak to the M+ peak (32:100 or approximately 1:3) is a classic isotopic signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom (³⁵Cl ≈ 75%, ³⁷Cl ≈ 25%).\n    *   Therefore, the molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis**:\n    *   A very broad absorption band from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is hydrogen-bonded.\n    *   A strong, sharp absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. The position is consistent with a carbonyl in a conjugated carboxylic acid.\n    *   Together, these two peaks strongly indicate the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n\n*   **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis**:\n    *   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H)**: This very downfield chemical shift is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). It is a singlet as it does not couple with other protons and integrates to one proton.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H)**: These signals are in the aromatic region of the spectrum (typically 7-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The two protons on one side of the ring are equivalent, as are the two protons on the other side, leading to this simplified pattern. The downfield shifts indicate the ring is attached to electron-withdrawing groups (like -COOH and -Cl).\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options**:\n    *   Let's check the molecular formula and structure for each option against the spectral data. The data points towards a molecule with the formula C₇H₅ClO₂, which has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for ³⁵Cl).\n\n    *   **A) Phenyl chloroformate**: MW ≈ 172.5 g/mol. This does not match the mass spec data.\n    *   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid**:\n        *   **MW**: C₇H₅ClO₂ -> (7×12)+(5×1)+35+(2×16) = 156 g/mol. Matches MS.\n        *   **Functional Group**: It is a carboxylic acid. Matches IR and the 11.0 ppm NMR signal.\n        *   **Substitution Pattern**: It is a *para*-substituted benzene ring. This perfectly matches the ¹H NMR aromatic signals (two doublets, each for 2H). The electron-withdrawing COOH group would cause the adjacent ortho protons to shift downfield (likely the 8.02 ppm signal), while the protons ortho to the chlorine would be slightly less deshielded (the 7.72 ppm signal). This is a perfect match.\n    *   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid**:\n        *   **MW**: 156 g/mol. Matches MS.\n        *   **Functional Group**: Carboxylic acid. Matches IR.\n        *   **Substitution Pattern**: *Ortho*-substituted. This would result in four unique aromatic protons, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern (e.g., multiplets, doublets of doublets), not two simple doublets. Does not match NMR.\n    *   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde**:\n        *   **MW**: 156 g/mol. Matches MS.\n        *   **Functional Group**: Contains an aldehyde and a phenol, not a carboxylic acid. This is inconsistent with the very broad IR peak and the 11.0 ppm NMR signal which are definitive for a carboxylic acid. Also, it only has 3 aromatic protons, which contradicts the integration of the NMR signals (2H + 2H = 4H).\n\n*   **Conclusion**:\n    All spectral data points unambiguously to 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>"
