    "This problem requires us to determine the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Let's analyze the structure of the target molecule and work backward to deduce a plausible synthetic route, then compare it with the given options.\n\n**Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n\n*   **Benzene ring** as the scaffold.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   Ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3, or -OEt) at C1.\n    *   tert-Butyl group (-C(CH3)3, or -tBu) at C2.\n    *   Nitro group (-NO2) at C3.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The three substituents are on adjacent carbons (a 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern).\n*   **Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n    *   -OEt: Strongly activating, ortho,para-director.\n    *   -tBu: Activating, ortho,para-director (bulky).\n    *   -NO2: Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\nA key challenge in this synthesis is creating the 1,2,3-substitution pattern. Direct electrophilic substitution on a monosubstituted benzene typically gives ortho/para or meta products, not a mixture that leads easily to a 1,2,3 pattern. Often, this requires manipulating the directing effects of substituents, for example by converting an amino group to a diazonium salt, or using a temporary blocking group.\n\nLet's consider the most likely final step. Introducing the ethoxy group last via a Williamson ether synthesis is a common and effective strategy. This would involve reacting the corresponding phenol with an ethyl halide.\n\n*   **Proposed Final Step:** `2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol + NaOH/EtBr -> 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene`\n    This reaction is sound. NaOH deprotonates the phenol, and the resulting phenoxide acts as a nucleophile to displace the bromide from ethyl bromide.\n\n*   **Penultimate Intermediate:** `2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol`\n    How do we make this phenol? A common way to make a phenol is from an aniline via diazotization followed by hydrolysis.\n    `2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline --(NaNO2, HCl)--> diazonium salt --(H2O, heat)--> 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol`\n    This sequence is also a standard, reliable method.\n\n*   **Key Intermediate:** `2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline`\n    The main synthetic challenge is now reduced to preparing this substituted aniline. Let's think about how to introduce these groups (amino, tert-butyl, nitro) with the correct 1,2,3-relationship.\n    A logical approach would be to start with 2-(tert-butyl)aniline and then nitrate it.\n\n    1.  **Preparation of 2-(tert-butyl)aniline:**\n        *   Start with benzene. Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride gives tert-butylbenzene. `Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl3 -> tert-Butylbenzene`.\n        *   Nitrate tert-butylbenzene. The t-Bu group is o,p-directing, but because it is very bulky, the para product (1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene) is major. The ortho product (1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene) is the minor product. To proceed, we must separate this ortho isomer. `tert-Butylbenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 -> 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene` (ortho) + `1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene` (para).\n        *   Reduce the nitro group of the ortho isomer to an amine using a reagent like Fe/HCl. `1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl -> 2-(tert-butyl)aniline`.\n\n    2.  **Nitration of 2-(tert-butyl)aniline to get 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline:**\n        *   Direct nitration of anilines with HNO3/H2SO4 is complex. The strong acid protonates the amino group to form an anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a meta-director.\n        *   So, we are nitrating the `2-(tert-butyl)anilinium ion`. Let's analyze the directing effects:\n            *   The `-NH3+` group at C1 is a meta-director, directing incoming electrophiles (NO2+) to C3 and C5.\n            *   The `-tBu` group at C2 is an ortho,para-director *relative to its own position*. Ortho positions are C1 and C3. The para position is C5.\n            *   Both groups cooperate to direct the incoming nitro group to positions C3 and C5.\n            *   This would produce a mixture of `2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline` and `2-tert-butyl-5-nitroaniline`. While a mixture is expected, this route provides a plausible pathway to the required `2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline` intermediate.\n\n**Summary of Plausible Synthesis:**\n1.  Benzene + `t-BuCl/AlCl3` -> tert-Butylbenzene\n2.  tert-Butylbenzene + `HNO3/H2SO4` -> 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene (minor ortho-product)\n3.  1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene + `Fe/HCl` -> 2-(tert-butyl)aniline\n4.  2-(tert-butyl)aniline + `HNO3/H2SO4` -> 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline\n5.  2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline + `NaNO2/HCl` -> Diazonium salt\n6.  Diazonium salt + `H3O+/Heat` -> 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol\n7.  2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol + `NaOH/EtBr` -> 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n\nNow, let's compare this deduced sequence with the given options.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...` Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline, which fails because the Lewis acid AlCl3 reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring. So, A is incorrect.\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...` This sequence leads to an intermediate where the t-butyl group and the eventual nitro group are in a meta relationship, which is inconsistent with the ortho relationship in the final product. So, B is incorrect.\n*   **Option C:** This sequence lists reagents in a chemically nonsensical order (e.g., trying to diazotize a molecule with no amino group at step iv). So, C is incorrect.\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4`\n    The first seven steps of this option (`i` to `vii`) exactly match the plausible synthesis we deduced above. Steps `viii` and `ix` are superfluous reagents added at the end, likely as distractors, as the target molecule has already been formed in step `vii`.\n\nDespite the potential for low yields at steps (ii) and (iv), this sequence is the only chemically logical and viable pathway among the choices to afford the desired product.\n\n<<<D>>>"
