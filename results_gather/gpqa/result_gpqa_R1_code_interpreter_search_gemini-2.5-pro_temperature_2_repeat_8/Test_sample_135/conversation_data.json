    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The problem asks for the evaluation of a volume integral of the divergence of a vector field `f`, i.e., `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Vector Field:**\n    *   The vector field `f(r)` has a magnitude `f(r) = 1/r^2`.\n    *   It has a non-zero component only along the radial direction.\n    *   In spherical coordinates, this can be written as the vector `f = (1/r^2) * r̂`, where `r̂` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\n3.  **Choose the Method of Solution:**\n    Directly calculating the divergence of `f` and then integrating it over the volume can be complicated because the field `f` is singular at the origin (r=0), and the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` involves a Dirac delta function. A much more straightforward method is to use the **Divergence Theorem** (also known as Gauss's Theorem).\n\n4.  **State the Divergence Theorem:**\n    The Divergence Theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the flux of that field through the closed surface enclosing the volume:\n    `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n    Where:\n    *   `V` is the volume of the sphere of radius `R`.\n    *   `S` is the closed surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n    *   `dS` is the differential surface area vector on the sphere.\n\n5.  **Apply the Theorem to the Problem:**\n    We will evaluate the surface integral `∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`.\n\n    *   **The vector field `f` on the surface `S`:** On the surface of the sphere, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So, `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r̂`.\n    *   **The differential surface area vector `dS`:** For a sphere, the differential surface area element in spherical coordinates is `dS = R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ`. The direction of this surface element is normal to the surface, which is the radial direction. So, the vector `dS` is `dS = (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r̂`.\n    *   **The dot product `f ⋅ dS`:** Now we calculate the dot product of the field and the surface element:\n        `f ⋅ dS = [(1/R^2) * r̂] ⋅ [(R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r̂]`\n        Since `r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1`, the dot product simplifies:\n        `f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * (R^2) * sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n        `f ⋅ dS = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n        Notice that the `R^2` terms cancel out.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Surface Integral:**\n    Now we integrate `f ⋅ dS` over the entire surface of the sphere. In spherical coordinates, this means integrating over the polar angle `θ` from 0 to `π`, and over the azimuthal angle `φ` from 0 to `2π`.\n\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_(φ=0)^(2π) ∫_(θ=0)^π sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n    We can separate the integrals since they are independent:\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ( ∫_(φ=0)^(2π) dφ ) * ( ∫_(θ=0)^π sin(θ) dθ )`\n\n    *   **Evaluate the `φ` integral:**\n        `∫_(φ=0)^(2π) dφ = [φ]_0^(2π) = 2π - 0 = 2π`\n    *   **Evaluate the `θ` integral:**\n        `∫_(θ=0)^π sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\n    *   **Multiply the results:**\n        `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = (2π) * (2) = 4π`\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    According to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral we wanted to find is equal to the surface integral we just calculated.\n    `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`\n\n    This result is a constant value and matches one of the options.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{4\\pi}$.\n<<<D>>>"
