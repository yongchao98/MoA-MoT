Its position is typical for an aromatic carboxylic acid where the carbonyl is conjugated with the benzene ring.\n    *   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These peaks confirm the presence of C=C bond stretching within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** The data unequivocally shows that Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This very downfield, broad singlet is the classic signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH), confirming the IR analysis.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** This distinctive pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a tell-tale sign of a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The protons at 8.0 ppm are shifted downfield because they are adjacent (ortho) to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group.\n    *   **Alkyl Group Structure Analysis:** The remaining signals describe the second substituent. We can assemble its structure by analyzing the integration and splitting patterns:\n        *   `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)`: A triplet for 3H indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This suggests an ethyl fragment (`-CH₂CH₃`).\n        *   `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)`: A doublet for 3H indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-).\n        *   `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)`: This multiplet for 1H has a chemical shift characteristic of a benzylic proton (one attached to the ring). Its splitting pattern and position indicate it is a methine (-CH-) group.\n        *   `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)`: This multiplet for 2H corresponds to the methylene (-CH₂-) group of the ethyl fragment.\n    *   **Assembling the Alkyl Group:** The benzylic carbon is a methine (-CH-), which is attached to both a methyl group (the 1.4 ppm doublet) and an ethyl group (the 1.7 ppm and 0.9 ppm signals). The complete structure of the substituent is **-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃**, which is a **sec-butyl** group.\n*   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the evidence, the starting material is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This is option A in the provided list, but it is the reactant, not the final product.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Chemical Reaction and Predict the Final Product**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Compound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) is treated with **red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI)**.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This combination of reagents is a powerful reducing agent. It is well-known for the complete reduction of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). Other parts of the molecule, such as the stable aromatic ring and the saturated sec-butyl group, are not affected.\n*   **Transformation:** The carboxylic acid group of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is converted into a methyl group.\n*   **Final Product:** The resulting molecule has a sec-butyl group and a methyl group on the benzene ring in a para arrangement. The correct name is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n### **Step 3: Match the Final Product with the Provided Options**\n\nWe now compare the deduced final product with the multiple-choice options.\n\n*   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: This is the starting material, not the final product.\n*   B) **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**: This name and structure exactly match our predicted final product.\n*   C) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: This is an incorrect structure.\n*   D) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: This has the incorrect alkyl isomer. The starting material has a sec-butyl group, not an isobutyl group, and this reaction does not cause such rearrangements.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThe problem requires a two-step analysis: first, identifying the starting material (Compound X) from its spectroscopic data, and second, predicting the product of its reaction with red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n\n### **Step 1: Identification of the Starting Material (Compound X)**\n\nThe structure of Compound X is determined by a systematic analysis of its Infrared (IR) and Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) spectra.\n\n**Careful Points for Analysis:**\n\n*   **IR Spectrum:**\n    *   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This is the most definitive feature. An extremely broad signal in this region is the textbook signature of an O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid, where hydrogen bonding between molecules (dimerization) causes significant peak broadening.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong, sharp signal for a carbonyl (C=O) group. Its frequency is slightly lower than that of a saturated aliphatic carboxylic acid (~1760 cm⁻¹), which indicates the carbonyl group is conjugated with a double bond system, most likely the aromatic ring.\n    *   **1610 cm⁻¹ & 1450 cm⁻¹:** These signals confirm the presence of C=C bond stretching within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet this far downfield is uniquely characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). This confirms the conclusion from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** This is a critical pattern. Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, indicate a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The protons at 8.0 ppm are *ortho* to the highly electron-withdrawing -COOH group, causing their strong deshielding (downfield shift). The protons at 7.2 ppm are *ortho* to the other substituent.\n    *   **Alkyl Group Signals:** The remaining signals must be pieced together to identify the second substituent.\n        *   We must distinguish between isomers like sec-butyl and isobutyl. An **isobutyl** group `(-CH₂CH(CH₃)₂)` would show a doublet for 6 protons. A **sec-butyl** group `(-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃)` has a more complex pattern, matching the data.\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for a methyl group (`-CH₃`) confirms it is adjacent to a methylene group (`-CH₂-`). This is the end of an ethyl fragment.\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for a methyl group (`-CH₃`) confirms it is adjacent to a methine group (`-CH-`).\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for one proton with a chemical shift typical of a benzylic proton (a proton on the carbon atom directly bonded to the ring). This must be the methine (`-CH-`) proton.\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for two protons corresponding to the methylene group (`-CH₂-`).\n    *   **Assembling the structure:** The benzylic carbon is a methine (`-CH-`) which is attached to both a methyl group (from the 1.4 ppm signal) and an ethyl group (from the 1.7 ppm and 0.9 ppm signals). This assembled group is `-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)`, which is a **sec-butyl group**.\n\n*   **Final Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the spectral evidence, the starting material is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n### **Step 2: Prediction of the Final Product**\n\nThe second part involves a chemical reaction.\n\n**Careful Points for Analysis:**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Red Phosphorus (P) and Hydroiodic Acid (HI).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This combination is a classic and very powerful reducing agent. Its primary and well-known function in this context is the complete reduction of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) directly to a methyl group (-CH₃). This is known as the Clemmensen or Wolff-Kishner reduction for carbonyls, but P/HI is a potent alternative that works on carboxylic acids directly.\n*   **Selectivity:** The reaction is selective for the carboxyl group. The aromatic ring and the saturated sec-butyl side chain are stable under these conditions and will remain unchanged.\n\n*   **Transformation:**\n    *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n    *   The -COOH group is reduced to a -CH₃ group.\n    *   Final Product: **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**\n\n### **Step 3: Matching with Options**\n\nFinally, we compare the name of the predicted product with the given multiple-choice options.\n\n*   A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: Incorrect. The structure and functional groups are wrong.\n*   B) **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**: Correct. This name and structure perfectly match the final product derived from the reaction.\n*   C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: Incorrect. This is the *starting material* (Compound X), not the final product. It is a common distractor in multi-step problems.\n*   D) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: Incorrect. This has the wrong alkyl isomer. The NMR data unambiguously indicated a sec-butyl group, which does not rearrange in this reaction.\n\nTherefore, the final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of the Starting Material (Compound X)**\n\nThe first crucial step is to correctly identify the reactant, Compound X, from its spectroscopic data. All candidate answers unanimously and correctly perform this step.\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This extremely broad signal is a definitive signature for the O-H stretch of a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH). This is a primary identifier of the functional group.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong, sharp peak corresponds to the carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Its frequency is typical for a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These peaks confirm the presence of C=C stretching from an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** The data unequivocally establishes that Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This broad singlet far downfield is the classic signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid, confirming the IR analysis.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** This distinct pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the unmistakable signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring.\n    *   **Alkyl Group Analysis:** The remaining signals define the second substituent. By analyzing their chemical shifts, splitting patterns (coupling), and integration, we can assemble the structure:\n        *   `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)`: The chemical shift indicates this is a benzylic proton (directly attached to the ring). The multiplicity suggests it has multiple neighbors. This is the methine (-CH-) group.\n        *   `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)`: A doublet for 3 protons means a -CH₃ group is attached to the methine (-CH-) group.\n        *   `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)` and `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)`: These two signals describe an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) which must also be attached to the benzylic methine carbon.\n        *   **Assembling the group:** The substituent attached to the ring is `-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)`, which is a **sec-butyl** group.\n    *   **Conclusion on Compound X:** The starting material is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Reaction and Predict the Final Product**\n\nThe second step is to determine the outcome of the reaction with the given reagents. All candidate answers are also in complete agreement on this step.\n\n*   **Reagents:** Red Phosphorus (Red P) and Hydroiodic Acid (HI).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This combination is a classic and very powerful reducing agent. It is known to perform the complete reduction of a carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) directly to a methyl group (`-CH₃`).\n*   **Selectivity:** This reaction is selective. It will not affect the stable aromatic ring or the saturated sec-butyl side chain. No rearrangement of the alkyl group occurs.\n*   **Transformation:**\n    *   The starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\n    *   The `-COOH` functional group is converted to a `-CH₃` group.\n    *   The final product is therefore **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n### **Step 3: Match the Product with the Options**\n\nThe final step is to select the option that corresponds to the predicted final product.\n\n*   **Predicted Product:** 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\n\nComparing this to the provided list of options:\n*   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: This is the starting material, a common distractor.\n*   **B) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: This exactly matches the predicted final product.**\n*   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: This has the incorrect alkyl isomer. The NMR data clearly show a sec-butyl group, which is retained in the reaction.\n*   D) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: This structure is inconsistent with the data.\n\nThe unanimous chemical reasoning across all candidate answers correctly identifies 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene as the final product. The inconsistencies in the lettered choices among the candidates arose from variations in the option lists they were given, not from errors in their chemical analysis. Based on the options provided in this prompt, the correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThis is a multi-step organic chemistry problem that requires identifying a starting material from its spectra and then predicting the product of a subsequent reaction.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of the Starting Material (Compound X)**\n\nThe structure of the reactant, Compound X, is determined by a combined analysis of its Infrared (IR) and Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) spectra.\n\n*   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This is a highly characteristic, extremely broad absorption peak that is the hallmark of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong, sharp absorption for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Its frequency is consistent with a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These are standard peaks for carbon-carbon double bond stretching within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** The IR data unambiguously identifies Compound X as an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This broad singlet, located very far downfield, is the classic signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid. This confirms the conclusion from the IR analysis.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** This distinctive pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a definitive signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons adjacent (ortho) to the strongly electron-withdrawing -COOH group.\n    *   **Alkyl Group Analysis:** The remaining signals are used to determine the structure of the second substituent.\n        *   We can assemble the fragments: a `CH3` next to a `CH` (from the 1.4 ppm doublet), an ethyl group (`CH2CH3`) (from the 0.9 ppm triplet and 1.7 ppm multiplet), and a `CH` group directly attached to the ring (the benzylic proton at 2.9 ppm).\n        *   Connecting these pieces, the benzylic methine (-CH-) group is attached to both a methyl group and an ethyl group. This forms the structure `-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)`, which is a **sec-butyl** group.\n    *   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all evidence, the starting material is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Reaction and Predict the Final Product**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Compound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) is reacted with **red phosphorus and HI** (hydroiodic acid).\n*   **Reagents' Function:** This combination is a classic and powerful reducing agent system. It is specifically known for the complete reduction of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). The aromatic ring and the saturated sec-butyl group are stable under these conditions and will not react.\n*   **Transformation:** The carboxylic acid group on the starting material is converted into a methyl group.\n    *   **Starting Material:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n    *   **Final Product:** The product is a benzene ring substituted at positions 1 and 4 with a sec-butyl group and a methyl group, respectively. The name of this molecule is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n### **Step 3: Match the Final Product with the Provided Options**\n\nNow, we compare the deduced final product with the given multiple-choice options.\n\n*   **A) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene:** This perfectly matches the predicted final product.\n*   **B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene:** This is incorrect.

Its frequency is typical for a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with a benzene ring.\n    *   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These peaks represent C=C bond stretching within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** The IR data conclusively identifies Compound X as an **aromatic carboxylic acid**.\n\n*   **Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This broad singlet far downfield is a classic signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH), confirming the IR analysis.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets, each representing two protons, is a definitive signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The downfield shift of the 8.0 ppm signal indicates these protons are adjacent (ortho) to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group.\n    *   **Alkyl Group Analysis:** The remaining signals (`0.9` to `2.9` ppm) describe the second substituent on the ring.\n        *   The signal at `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)` is a methine (-CH-) group directly attached to the ring (benzylic position).\n        *   This methine is coupled to two other groups: a methyl group (`-CH₃`) which appears as a doublet at `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)`, and an ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`).\n        *   The ethyl group is identified by the triplet at `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)` (for the terminal `-CH₃`) and the multiplet at `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)` (for the `-CH₂-`).\n        *   Assembling these pieces, the substituent is `-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)`, which is a **sec-butyl** group.\n    *   **Conclusion on Compound X:** The starting material is a benzene ring substituted with a sec-butyl group and a carboxylic acid group at opposite (para) positions.

    "This is a multi-step organic chemistry problem that requires a careful, systematic analysis of spectroscopic data followed by the prediction of a chemical reaction's outcome.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**Part 1: Determine the Structure of the Starting Material (Compound X)**\n\nThe first objective is to elucidate the structure of Compound X by interpreting its Infrared (IR) and ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) spectra.\n\n**Careful Points for Analysis (Spectroscopy):**\n\n1.  **Identify the Primary Functional Group (IR):** The IR spectrum shows two critical peaks:\n    *   A very broad absorption from **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is the unambiguous signature of an O-H stretch in a hydrogen-bonded **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**.\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Its position, slightly lower than a non-conjugated acid, suggests it's part of an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n    *   *Conclusion:* Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid. The ¹H NMR peak at **10.5 ppm** (a broad singlet for 1H) is a classic signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid, confirming this conclusion.\n\n2.  **Determine the Aromatic Substitution Pattern (¹H NMR):**\n    *   The aromatic region shows two distinct doublets at **8.0 ppm (2H)** and **7.2 ppm (2H)**. This specific A₂B₂ pattern is a clear indication of a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The protons at 8.0 ppm are more deshielded (shifted downfield) because they are adjacent (ortho) to the strongly electron-withdrawing -COOH group.\n\n3.  **Identify the Alkyl Group Isomer (¹H NMR):**\n    *   The remaining signals describe the second substituent. We must piece them together to identify the specific isomer (e.g., sec-butyl vs. isobutyl vs. tert-butyl).\n    *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** This is a methine (-CH-) proton, and its chemical shift indicates it is directly attached to the benzene ring (a benzylic proton).\n    *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** This is a methyl (-CH₃) group adjacent to the single methine proton, hence it's a doublet.\n    *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)** and **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** This triplet and multiplet pair describe an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   **Assembling the group:** The benzylic carbon (-CH-) is attached to both a methyl group and an ethyl group. This creates a **-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃** structure, which is a **sec-butyl** group.\n\n**Conclusion for Compound X:** Combining these findings, Compound X is a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid and a sec-butyl group in a para orientation. Its IUPAC name is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n---\n\n**Part 2: Analyze the Chemical Reaction and Predict the Final Product**\n\nThe second objective is to determine what happens when 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid reacts with the given reagents.\n\n**Careful Points for Analysis (Reaction):**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reagents' Function:** The reagents are **red phosphorus and HI (hydroiodic acid)**. This combination is a classic and very powerful reducing agent system.\n\n2.  **Know the Specific Transformation:** The most well-known use for red P / HI in this context is the complete reduction of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) directly to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n\n3.  **Consider Selectivity and Side Reactions:** This reaction is highly selective for the carboxyl group. The stable aromatic ring and the saturated sec-butyl side chain will not be affected. No skeletal rearrangements of the alkyl group occur under these conditions.\n\n**Conclusion for Final Product:**\n*   **Starting Material:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n*   **Transformation:** The -COOH group is reduced to a -CH₃ group.\n*   **Final Product:** The resulting molecule is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Match the Final Product to the Options**\n\nThe final step is to select the option that correctly names the final product.\n\n*   Predicted Product: **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n*   A) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: Incorrect. The starting material contains a sec-butyl group, not an isobutyl group.\n*   B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: Incorrect. This structure is inconsistent with the starting material and the reaction.\n*   C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: Incorrect. This is the starting material, a common distractor.\n*   D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: **Correct.** This name and structure exactly match the predicted final product.\n\n<<<D>>>"

The protons at 8.0 ppm are shifted downfield because they are adjacent (ortho) to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group.\n    *   **Alkyl Group Structure Analysis:** The remaining signals describe the second substituent. We can assemble its structure by analyzing the integration and splitting patterns:\n        *   `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)`: A triplet for 3H indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This suggests an ethyl fragment (`-CH₂CH₃`).\n        *   `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)`: A doublet for 3H indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-).\n        *   `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)`: This multiplet for 1H has a chemical shift characteristic of a benzylic proton (one attached to the ring). Its splitting pattern and position indicate it is a methine (-CH-) group.\n        *   `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)`: This multiplet for 2H corresponds to the methylene (-CH₂-) group of the ethyl fragment.\n    *   **Assembling the Alkyl Group:** The benzylic carbon is a methine (-CH-), which is attached to both a methyl group (the 1.4 ppm doublet) and an ethyl group (the 1.7 ppm and 0.9 ppm signals). The complete structure of the substituent is **-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃**, which is a **sec-butyl** group.\n*   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the evidence, the starting material is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

An extremely broad signal in this region is the textbook signature of an O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid, where hydrogen bonding between molecules (dimerization) causes significant peak broadening.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong, sharp signal for a carbonyl (C=O) group. Its frequency is slightly lower than that of a saturated aliphatic carboxylic acid (~1760 cm⁻¹), which indicates the carbonyl group is conjugated with a double bond system, most likely the aromatic ring.\n    *   **1610 cm⁻¹ & 1450 cm⁻¹:** These signals confirm the presence of C=C bond stretching within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet this far downfield is uniquely characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). This confirms the conclusion from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** This is a critical pattern. Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, indicate a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The protons at 8.0 ppm are *ortho* to the highly electron-withdrawing -COOH group, causing their strong deshielding (downfield shift). The protons at 7.2 ppm are *ortho* to the other substituent.\n    *   **Alkyl Group Signals:** The remaining signals must be pieced together to identify the second substituent.\n        *   We must distinguish between isomers like sec-butyl and isobutyl. An **isobutyl** group `(-CH₂CH(CH₃)₂)` would show a doublet for 6 protons. A **sec-butyl** group `(-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃)` has a more complex pattern, matching the data.\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for a methyl group (`-CH₃`) confirms it is adjacent to a methylene group (`-CH₂-`). This is the end of an ethyl fragment.\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for a methyl group (`-CH₃`) confirms it is adjacent to a methine group (`-CH-`).\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for one proton with a chemical shift typical of a benzylic proton (a proton on the carbon atom directly bonded to the ring). This must be the methine (`-CH-`) proton.\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for two protons corresponding to the methylene group (`-CH₂-`).\n    *   **Assembling the structure:** The benzylic carbon is a methine (`-CH-`) which is attached to both a methyl group (from the 1.4 ppm signal) and an ethyl group (from the 1.7 ppm and 0.9 ppm signals).

Its primary and well-known function in this context is the complete reduction of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) directly to a methyl group (-CH₃). This is known as the Clemmensen or Wolff-Kishner reduction for carbonyls, but P/HI is a potent alternative that works on carboxylic acids directly.\n*   **Selectivity:** The reaction is selective for the carboxyl group. The aromatic ring and the saturated sec-butyl side chain are stable under these conditions and will remain unchanged.\n\n*   **Transformation:**\n    *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n    *   The -COOH group is reduced to a -CH₃ group.\n    *   Final Product: **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**\n\n### **Step 3: Matching with Options**\n\nFinally, we compare the name of the predicted product with the given multiple-choice options.\n\n*   A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: Incorrect.

All candidate answers unanimously and correctly perform this step.\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This extremely broad signal is a definitive signature for the O-H stretch of a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH).

By analyzing their chemical shifts, splitting patterns (coupling), and integration, we can assemble the structure:\n        *   `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)`: The chemical shift indicates this is a benzylic proton (directly attached to the ring). The multiplicity suggests it has multiple neighbors.

Based on the options provided in this prompt, the correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThis is a multi-step organic chemistry problem that requires identifying a starting material from its spectra and then predicting the product of a subsequent reaction.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of the Starting Material (Compound X)**\n\nThe structure of the reactant, Compound X, is determined by a combined analysis of its Infrared (IR) and Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) spectra.\n\n*   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This is a highly characteristic, extremely broad absorption peak that is the hallmark of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong, sharp absorption for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Its frequency is consistent with a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These are standard peaks for carbon-carbon double bond stretching within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** The IR data unambiguously identifies Compound X as an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This broad singlet, located very far downfield, is the classic signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid. This confirms the conclusion from the IR analysis.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** This distinctive pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a definitive signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons adjacent (ortho) to the strongly electron-withdrawing -COOH group.\n    *   **Alkyl Group Analysis:** The remaining signals are used to determine the structure of the second substituent.\n        *   We can assemble the fragments: a `CH3` next to a `CH` (from the 1.4 ppm doublet), an ethyl group (`CH2CH3`) (from the 0.9 ppm triplet and 1.7 ppm multiplet), and a `CH` group directly attached to the ring (the benzylic proton at 2.9 ppm).\n        *   Connecting these pieces, the benzylic methine (-CH-) group is attached to both a methyl group and an ethyl group. This forms the structure `-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)`, which is a **sec-butyl** group.\n    *   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all evidence, the starting material is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Reaction and Predict the Final Product**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Compound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) is reacted with **red phosphorus and HI** (hydroiodic acid).\n*   **Reagents' Function:** This combination is a classic and powerful reducing agent system. It is specifically known for the complete reduction of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). The aromatic ring and the saturated sec-butyl group are stable under these conditions and will not react.\n*   **Transformation:** The carboxylic acid group on the starting material is converted into a methyl group.\n    *   **Starting Material:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n    *   **Final Product:** The product is a benzene ring substituted at positions 1 and 4 with a sec-butyl group and a methyl group, respectively. The name of this molecule is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n### **Step 3: Match the Final Product with the Provided Options**\n\nNow, we compare the deduced final product with the given multiple-choice options.\n\n*   **A) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene:** This perfectly matches the predicted final product.\n*   **B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene:** This is incorrect. The NMR data clearly indicate a sec-butyl group, not an isobutyl isomer.\n*   **C) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid:** This is an entirely different molecular structure.\n*   **D) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid:** This is the starting material (Compound X), not the final product of the reaction. This is a common type of distractor in multi-step problems.\n\nThe analysis of the spectra and the chemical reaction leads to the unambiguous conclusion that the final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis problem requires a two-step analysis: first, deducing the structure of the starting material from spectroscopic data, and second, predicting the outcome of the given chemical reaction.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis and Key Points**\n\n**Step 1: Identifying the Starting Material (Compound X)**\n\nThe structure of Compound X is determined by a careful interpretation of its Infrared (IR) and Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) spectra.\n\n*   **Analysis of IR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Careful Point 1 (Carboxylic Acid O-H):** The extremely broad absorption between 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ is a definitive and unmistakable feature of the O-H stretch in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH) dimer.\n    *   **Careful Point 2 (Carbonyl Group):** The strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to a C=O carbonyl stretch. Its position is consistent with a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with a benzene ring.\n    *   **Careful Point 3 (Aromatic Ring):** The absorptions at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ confirm the presence of C=C double bonds within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** The data unanimously indicates that Compound X is an **aromatic carboxylic acid**.\n\n*   **Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Careful Point 4 (Carboxylic Acid Proton):** The broad singlet at 10.5 ppm, integrating to one proton, is the classic signal for the highly deshielded acidic proton of the -COOH group. This confirms the IR analysis.\n    *   **Careful Point 5 (Substitution Pattern):** The pair of doublets at 8.0 ppm (2H) and 7.2 ppm (2H) is a classic signature for a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The protons at 8.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group, causing their downfield shift.\n    *   **Careful Point 6 (Alkyl Group Assembly):** The remaining signals must be pieced together to form the second substituent:\n        *   The signal at `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)` is the most downfield of the alkyl signals, indicating it's a benzylic proton (directly attached to the ring). Its multiplicity suggests it's a methine (-CH-).\n        *   The doublet at `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)` represents a methyl group (-CH₃) coupled to this single methine proton.\n        *   The triplet at `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)` represents a methyl group coupled to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n        *   The multiplet at `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)` is the methylene group, which is coupled to both the terminal methyl group and the benzylic methine group.\n        *   Assembling these pieces, the substituent is **-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃**, which is a **sec-butyl** group.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Compound X:** The starting material is a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid and a sec-butyl group in a para (1,4) arrangement. The correct name is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n**Step 2: Predicting the Final Product**\n\n*   **Careful Point 7 (Reaction Reagents):** The reagents are **red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI)**. This combination is a classic and very powerful reducing agent.\n*   **Careful Point 8 (Reaction Transformation):** The known function of Red P / HI is the complete reduction of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   **Careful Point 9 (Selectivity):** This reaction is highly selective for the carbonyl/carboxyl group. The stable aromatic ring and the saturated sec-butyl group are unreactive under these conditions and will remain unchanged. No rearrangement of the alkyl group occurs.\n*   **Conclusion for Final Product:** The carboxylic acid group of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is reduced to a methyl group. The final product is therefore **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n**Step 3: Matching the Final Product to the Options**\n\nComparing the deduced final product, **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**, with the provided choices:\n*   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: This is the starting material (Compound X), not the final product.\n*   **B) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**: This name and structure exactly match the predicted final product.\n*   C) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: This is an entirely different molecular structure.\n*   D) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: This has the incorrect alkyl isomer.

It is known for its ability to completely reduce carbonyl-containing groups, including carboxylic acids, to their corresponding alkanes.\n*   **Transformation:** The reaction will convert the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid into a methyl group (-CH₃). The aromatic ring and the stable sec-butyl group will not be affected.\n*   **Structure of the Final Product:** The starting material, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, is transformed into **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n### **Step 3: Match the Final Product with the Provided Options**\n\nFinally, we compare the deduced product with the given multiple-choice options.\n\n*   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: This is the starting material, not the final product. It is a common distractor in multi-step problems.\n*   B) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: This name and structure exactly match our predicted final product.\n*   C) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: This is an entirely different molecular structure and is inconsistent with the data.\n*   D) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: This has the incorrect alkyl isomer. The NMR data clearly show a sec-butyl group, not an isobutyl group, and this reaction does not cause such a rearrangement.\n\nThe analysis of the starting material and the reaction chemistry consistently leads to **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene** as the final product.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem requires a two-step analysis: first, identifying the starting material (Compound X) from its spectroscopic data, and second, predicting the product of its reaction with red phosphorus and HI.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of the Starting Material (Compound X)**\n\nThe structure of Compound X is determined by interpreting the provided IR and ¹H NMR spectra.\n\n*   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The extremely broad absorption from **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is a definitive feature of the O-H stretch in a hydrogen-bonded **carboxylic acid** (-COOH).\n    *   The strong, sharp peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Its frequency is consistent with a carboxylic acid conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   The peaks at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** confirm the presence of an **aromatic ring**.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This very downfield broad singlet confirms the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid**, supporting the IR data.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** This pair of doublets is a classic signature for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The protons at 8.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group, causing their significant downfield shift.\n    *   **Alkyl Group Analysis:** The remaining signals define the second substituent:\n        *   `2.9 ppm (m, 1H)`: A downfield methine (-CH-) proton, indicating it is attached directly to the benzene ring (benzylic position).\n        *   `1.4 ppm (d, 3H)`: A methyl (-CH₃) group adjacent to the methine proton.\n        *   `1.7 ppm (m, 2H)` and `0.9 ppm (t, 3H)`: These signals represent an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) also attached to the benzylic methine proton.\n    *   **Assembling the Structure:** Combining the fragments, the substituent is a methine carbon bonded to the ring, a methyl group, and an ethyl group. This is the **sec-butyl group** `[-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)]`.\n\n*   **Final Structure of Compound X:** Combining all evidence, the starting material is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This is option D, but it is the reactant, not the final product.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the Final Product of the Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Compound X is reacted with **red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI)**.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This reagent combination is a classic and very powerful reducing agent. It is specifically known for the complete reduction of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) all the way down to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   **Transformation:** The reaction will convert the -COOH group into a -CH₃ group while leaving the stable aromatic ring and the sec-butyl group untouched.\n    *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n    *   Final Product: **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**\n\n### **Step 3: Match the Final Product with the Provided Options**\n\nFinally, we match the predicted product with the given list:\n\n*   **A) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene:** This exactly matches the predicted final product.\n*   **B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene:** This is incorrect.

The two protons at 8.0 ppm are ortho to the strongly electron-withdrawing -COOH group, causing them to be more deshielded (further downfield). The two protons at 7.2 ppm are ortho to the second substituent.\n    *   **Alkyl Group Analysis**: The remaining signals are pieced together to determine the structure of the second substituent:\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: This methine (-CH-) proton is shifted downfield because it is benzylic (directly attached to the ring).\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: A methyl group (-CH₃) attached to the benzylic methine carbon.\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)** and **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: These signals describe an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) which is also attached to the benzylic methine carbon.\n    *   **Assembling the structure**: The substituent attached to the benzene ring is **-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)**, which is a **sec-butyl** group.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n**Step 2: Predict the Product of the Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagents**: Compound X is reacted with **red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI)**.\n*   **Reaction Type**: This reagent combination is a powerful reducing agent, famous for its ability to completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃).

Its frequency is typical for a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring, which provides extra stability and slightly lowers the frequency.\n    *   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These peaks represent C=C bond stretching within an aromatic ring, confirming its presence.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** The IR data conclusively identifies Compound X as an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Careful Points from ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet this far downfield is a classic signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH), confirming the IR analysis.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern is a definitive signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.

Its multiplicity indicates it has multiple neighbors. It's a methine (-CH-).\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** This doublet represents a methyl group (-CH₃) coupled to a single proton, which must be the benzylic methine.\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H) and 1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** This triplet and multiplet combination describe an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).
