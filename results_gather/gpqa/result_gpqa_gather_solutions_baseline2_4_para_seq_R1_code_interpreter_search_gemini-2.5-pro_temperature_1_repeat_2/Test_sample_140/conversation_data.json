Identify the Reaction Type and Mechanism**\n*   **Reactants:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d (an aryl halide with a deuterium isotope label) and sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia.\n*   **Mechanism:** The presence of an aryl halide and a very strong base like NaNH₂ is the classic setup for an **elimination-addition reaction**. This reaction proceeds through a highly reactive intermediate known as **benzyne**.\n\n**2. Step 1: Elimination – Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe reaction begins when the amide ion (NH₂⁻), acting as a strong base, removes a hydrogen (or its isotope, a deuteron) from a position *ortho* to the bromine atom.\n\n*   **Careful Point #1: Non-equivalent ortho positions.** The starting material has two chemically distinct ortho positions relative to the bromine:\n    *   **Position C6:** Contains a standard hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   **Position C2:** Contains a deuterium atom (D).\n*   **Careful Point #2: All possible pathways.** The question asks for all *possible* organic products, so both elimination pathways must be considered, regardless of their relative rates (the C-H bond breaks faster than the C-D bond due to the kinetic isotope effect, but both are possible).\n\nThis leads to two different benzyne intermediates:\n*   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The base removes the proton from C6. This is followed by the loss of the bromide ion from C1, creating a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains in place. The resulting intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n*   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The base removes the deuteron from C2. This is followed by the loss of the bromide ion from C1, creating a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is lost from the molecule in this step. The resulting intermediate is standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n**3. Step 2: Addition – Nucleophilic Attack on the Intermediates**\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) also acts as a nucleophile, attacking the reactive triple bond of the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\n*   **Careful Point #3: Symmetry of the intermediates.** The number of products formed from each intermediate depends on its symmetry.\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (Pathway A):** This intermediate is unsymmetrical. Nucleophilic attack can occur at either of the two carbons in the triple bond, leading to two distinct products:\n    1.  Attack at C1 gives **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    2.  Attack at C6 gives **3-deuteroaniline**.\n*   **Product from Benzyne (Pathway B):** This intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium. Nucleophilic attack at either carbon of the triple bond, followed by protonation, leads to only one, identical product:\n    3.  **Aniline**.\n\n**4. Final Tally of Products**\nBy combining all unique products from all possible reaction pathways, we find a total of three structurally distinct organic molecules:\n1.  Aniline\n2.  2-deuteroaniline\n3.  3-deuteroaniline\n\nTherefore, the total number of possible organic products is **3**.\n\n**Matching to Options**\nThe options provided in the question are:\nA) 1\nB) 2\nC) 4\nD) 3\n\nThe chemically correct number of products is 3, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem, synthesizing the consensus reasoning from the provided candidate answers and highlighting the crucial points.\n\n**1. Identification of the Reaction Mechanism**\n\n*   **Reactants**: The substrate is 1-bromobenzene-2-d, an aryl halide with an isotopic label. The reagents are sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃).\n*   **Mechanism**: The combination of an aryl halide with a very strong base like NaNH₂ is classic for an **elimination-addition reaction**. This mechanism proceeds through a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**. All candidate answers correctly identified this as the operative mechanism.\n\n**2. Step 1: Elimination — Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThis is the first and most critical step in determining the variety of products. The strong base (amide ion, NH₂⁻) abstracts a proton (or its isotope, a deuteron) from a position *ortho* to the bromine leaving group.\n\n*   **Careful Point #1: Non-Equivalent Ortho Positions.** The starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, has two distinct ortho positions relative to the bromine atom.\n    *   **Position C6:** Contains a standard hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   **Position C2:** Contains a deuterium atom (D).\n*   **Consequence:** Because there are two different atoms to abstract, two separate elimination pathways are possible, leading to the formation of two different benzyne intermediates. The question asks for all *possible* products, so both pathways must be considered.\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The base removes H from C6. Subsequent elimination of Br⁻ creates a benzyne with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 is untouched. The resulting intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The base removes D from C2. Subsequent elimination of Br⁻ creates a benzyne with a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium is removed in this pathway. The resulting intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n**3. Step 2: Addition — Nucleophilic Attack on the Intermediates**\n\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) also acts as a nucleophile, attacking the reactive triple bond of each benzyne intermediate. The resulting aryl anion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\n*   **Careful Point #2: Symmetry of the Intermediates.** The number of products from this step depends entirely on the symmetry of the benzyne intermediates formed in Step 1.\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (Pathway A):** This intermediate is **unsymmetrical**. The nucleophile (NH₂⁻) can attack either of the two carbons in the triple bond, leading to two structurally distinct products.\n    *   Attack at C1 gives **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   Attack at C6 gives **3-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   Therefore, Pathway A generates **two** products.\n*   **Product from benzyne (Pathway B):** This intermediate is **symmetrical**. Nucleophilic attack at either carbon of the triple bond leads to the same single product after protonation.\n    *   Attack at either carbon gives **aniline**.\n    *   Therefore, Pathway B generates **one** product.\n\n**4. Final Tally and Conclusion**\n\nTo find the total number of possible organic products, we sum the unique products from all pathways:\n1.

Analyze Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\nThe amide ion acts as a base and abstracts a hydrogen (or deuterium) from a position *ortho* to the bromine leaving group.\n*   **Careful Point 1: Two Distinct Ortho Positions**: The starting material has two non-equivalent ortho positions:\n    *   Position C2, which holds a deuterium atom (D).\n    *   Position C6, which holds a normal hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Careful Point 2: All Possible Pathways**: The question asks for all *possible* organic products, so we must consider that the base can abstract from either position, leading to two different benzyne intermediates.\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction)**: The amide ion removes H⁺ from C6. Subsequent loss of the bromide ion from C1 forms a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 is unaffected.

Sodium amide is an extremely strong base.\n*   **Careful Point 1: Recognizing the Mechanism:** These conditions are classic for an **elimination-addition reaction**, which proceeds through a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**. It is crucial not to mistake this for other mechanisms like SₙAr, which would require different substrate or reaction conditions.\n\n**Step 2: The Elimination Step – Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) acts as a base, abstracting a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* to the bromine leaving group.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Identifying all possible elimination sites:** The starting material has two non-equivalent ortho positions: C6, which holds a standard hydrogen atom (H), and C2, which holds a deuterium atom (D). Since the question asks for all *possible* products, both abstraction pathways must be considered.\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The base removes H⁺ from C6.

Formation of Benzyne Intermediates (The Elimination Step)**\n*   **Process**: The amide ion (NH₂⁻) acts as a base and removes a proton (or in this case, a deuteron) from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine atom. This is followed by the spontaneous loss of the bromide ion (Br⁻) to form the benzyne triple bond.\n*   **Careful Point 1: Non-equivalent ortho positions.** The starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, has two different ortho positions relative to the bromine:\n    *   **Position C6:** Holds a standard hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   **Position C2:** Holds a deuterium atom (D), an isotope of hydrogen.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Multiple pathways.** Because these two positions are chemically distinct, there are two possible elimination pathways, leading to the formation of two different benzyne intermediates. The question asks for all *possible* products, so both pathways must be considered.\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** Abstraction of the proton from C6, followed by Br⁻ loss, creates a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 is unaffected. The intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** Abstraction of the deuteron from C2, followed by Br⁻ loss, creates a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium is removed in this step. The intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n**3. Nucleophilic Attack on the Intermediates (The Addition Step)**\n*   **Process**: The amide ion (NH₂⁻) also functions as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the benzyne's reactive triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Symmetry of the intermediates dictates the number of products.**\n    *   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (Pathway A):** This intermediate is unsymmetrical. Therefore, nucleophilic attack at the two ends of the triple bond (C1 and C6) results in two structurally different products:\n        1.  Attack at C1 gives **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        2.  Attack at C6 gives **3-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   **Product from benzyne (Pathway B):** This intermediate is symmetrical. Attack at either C1 or C2 of the triple bond leads to the same single product after protonation:\n        3.  **Aniline**.\n\n**4. Final Tally of Possible Products**\nTo find the total number of unique organic products, we collect all the products formed from every possible pathway:\n1.  Aniline\n2.  2-deuteroaniline\n3.  3-deuteroaniline\n\nThere are a total of **3** possible organic products.

These conditions are characteristic of an **elimination-addition reaction**, which proceeds through a highly reactive **benzyne** intermediate. The amide ion (NH₂⁻) acts first as a strong base and then as a nucleophile.\n\n**Step 2: The Elimination Step and Formation of Intermediates**\nThis is the most critical part of the analysis. The reaction is initiated by the amide base abstracting a hydrogen (or its isotope, deuterium) from a position *ortho* to the bromine atom.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Two Non-Equivalent Ortho Positions.** The starting material has two distinct ortho positions relative to the bromine: the C6 position has a hydrogen atom (H), and the C2 position has a deuterium atom (D). Because H and D are different isotopes, these positions are not chemically equivalent.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Formation of Two Different Benzyne Intermediates.** Since abstraction can occur from either ortho position, two different pathways are possible, leading to two distinct benzyne intermediates.\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The base removes the proton from C6. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 forms a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 is unaffected. The resulting intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The base removes the deuteron from C2. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 forms a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is lost in this process. The resulting intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n**Step 3: The Addition Step and Formation of Products**\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) now acts as a nucleophile, attacking the reactive triple bond of each benzyne intermediate.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Symmetry of the Intermediates Determines the Product Count.** The number of products formed from each intermediate depends on its symmetry.\n    *   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (Unsymmetrical):** This intermediate is not symmetrical. Nucleophilic attack can occur at either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C6), leading to two structurally different products after protonation.\n        1.  Attack at C1 yields **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        2.  Attack at C6 yields **3-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   **Product from benzyne (Symmetrical):** This intermediate is symmetrical and has no deuterium. Nucleophilic attack at either carbon of the triple bond leads to the same single product after protonation.\n        3.  The single product is **aniline**.\n\n**Step 4: Final Tally**\nBy combining the unique organic products from all possible pathways, we find there are three structurally distinct molecules that can be formed:\n1.  Aniline\n2.  2-deuteroaniline\n3.  3-deuteroaniline\n\nTherefore, the total number of possible organic products is **3**.\n\n**Final Answer Selection**\nMatching this number to the provided options:\nA) 4\nB) 2\nC) 3\nD) 1\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided answers, here is a consolidated, step-by-step reasoning to determine the final correct answer.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type and Mechanism:**\n    *   **Reactants**: The problem describes the reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃).\n    *   **Mechanism**: The combination of an aryl halide and a very strong base like NaNH₂ is characteristic of an **elimination-addition reaction**.

It abstracts a proton (H⁺) or a deuteron (D⁺) from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine atom.\n    *   A critical aspect of this specific problem is that the starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, has **two non-equivalent ortho positions**:\n        *   **Position C6**: Holds a standard hydrogen atom (H).\n        *   **Position C2**: Holds a deuterium atom (D), an isotope of hydrogen.\n    *   Since the question asks for all *possible* products, both deprotonation/deuteronation events must be considered, leading to two separate pathways and two distinct benzyne intermediates.\n        *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction)**: Removal of the proton from C6, followed by the loss of the bromide ion, forms a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 is untouched. The resulting intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n        *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction)**: Removal of the deuteron from C2, followed by the loss of the bromide ion, forms a triple bond between C1 and C2.

Attack at C6 gives **3-deuteroaniline**.\n        *   **Products from benzyne (symmetrical)**: Since this intermediate is symmetrical, attack at either carbon of the triple bond leads to a single, identical product.\n            3.  The product is **aniline**.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion and Tally**\n    *   By summing the unique products generated from all possible pathways, we find three structurally distinct organic molecules.\n    1.

Step 1: Elimination – Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe reaction begins when the amide ion (NH₂⁻), acting as a strong base, removes a hydrogen (or its isotope, a deuteron) from a position *ortho* to the bromine atom.\n\n*   **Careful Point #1: Non-equivalent ortho positions.** The starting material has two chemically distinct ortho positions relative to the bromine:\n    *   **Position C6:** Contains a standard hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   **Position C2:** Contains a deuterium atom (D).\n*   **Careful Point #2: All possible pathways.** The question asks for all *possible* organic products, so both elimination pathways must be considered, regardless of their relative rates (the C-H bond breaks faster than the C-D bond due to the kinetic isotope effect, but both are possible).\n\nThis leads to two different benzyne intermediates:\n*   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The base removes the proton from C6. This is followed by the loss of the bromide ion from C1, creating a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains in place. The resulting intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n*   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The base removes the deuteron from C2. This is followed by the loss of the bromide ion from C1, creating a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is lost from the molecule in this step. The resulting intermediate is standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n**3. Step 2: Addition – Nucleophilic Attack on the Intermediates**\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) also acts as a nucleophile, attacking the reactive triple bond of the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\n*   **Careful Point #3: Symmetry of the intermediates.** The number of products formed from each intermediate depends on its symmetry.\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (Pathway A):** This intermediate is unsymmetrical. Nucleophilic attack can occur at either of the two carbons in the triple bond, leading to two distinct products:\n    1.  Attack at C1 gives **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    2.  Attack at C6 gives **3-deuteroaniline**.\n*   **Product from Benzyne (Pathway B):** This intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium. Nucleophilic attack at either carbon of the triple bond, followed by protonation, leads to only one, identical product:\n    3.  **Aniline**.\n\n**4. Final Tally of Products**\nBy combining all unique products from all possible reaction pathways, we find a total of three structurally distinct organic molecules:\n1.

Step 1: Elimination — Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThis is the first and most critical step in determining the variety of products.

The question asks for all *possible* products, so both pathways must be considered.\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The base removes H from C6. Subsequent elimination of Br⁻ creates a benzyne with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 is untouched. The resulting intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The base removes D from C2. Subsequent elimination of Br⁻ creates a benzyne with a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium is removed in this pathway. The resulting intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n**3. Step 2: Addition — Nucleophilic Attack on the Intermediates**\n\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) also acts as a nucleophile, attacking the reactive triple bond of each benzyne intermediate. The resulting aryl anion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\n*   **Careful Point #2: Symmetry of the Intermediates.** The number of products from this step depends entirely on the symmetry of the benzyne intermediates formed in Step 1.\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (Pathway A):** This intermediate is **unsymmetrical**. The nucleophile (NH₂⁻) can attack either of the two carbons in the triple bond, leading to two structurally distinct products.\n    *   Attack at C1 gives **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   Attack at C6 gives **3-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   Therefore, Pathway A generates **two** products.\n*   **Product from benzyne (Pathway B):** This intermediate is **symmetrical**.

Identification of the Reaction Mechanism**\n*   **Reactants**: The substrate is 1-bromobenzene-2-d, and the reagent is sodium amide (NaNH₂) dissolved in liquid ammonia (NH₃).\n*   **Analysis**: Sodium amide is an exceptionally strong base. When it reacts with an aryl halide like bromobenzene, which lacks strong electron-withdrawing groups required for SₙAr, the reaction proceeds via an **elimination-addition mechanism**. The highly reactive intermediate in this mechanism is called **benzyne**.\n*   **Consensus**: All 15 candidate answers correctly identify this as the reaction mechanism.\n\n**2. Formation of Benzyne Intermediates (The Elimination Step)**\n*   **Process**: The amide ion (NH₂⁻) acts as a base and removes a proton (or in this case, a deuteron) from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine atom. This is followed by the spontaneous loss of the bromide ion (Br⁻) to form the benzyne triple bond.\n*   **Careful Point 1: Non-equivalent ortho positions.** The starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, has two different ortho positions relative to the bromine:\n    *   **Position C6:** Holds a standard hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   **Position C2:** Holds a deuterium atom (D), an isotope of hydrogen.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Multiple pathways.** Because these two positions are chemically distinct, there are two possible elimination pathways, leading to the formation of two different benzyne intermediates. The question asks for all *possible* products, so both pathways must be considered.\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** Abstraction of the proton from C6, followed by Br⁻ loss, creates a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 is unaffected. The intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** Abstraction of the deuteron from C2, followed by Br⁻ loss, creates a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium is removed in this step. The intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n**3. Nucleophilic Attack on the Intermediates (The Addition Step)**\n*   **Process**: The amide ion (NH₂⁻) also functions as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the benzyne's reactive triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Symmetry of the intermediates dictates the number of products.**\n    *   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (Pathway A):** This intermediate is unsymmetrical. Therefore, nucleophilic attack at the two ends of the triple bond (C1 and C6) results in two structurally different products:\n        1.  Attack at C1 gives **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        2.  Attack at C6 gives **3-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   **Product from benzyne (Pathway B):** This intermediate is symmetrical. Attack at either C1 or C2 of the triple bond leads to the same single product after protonation:\n        3.  **Aniline**.\n\n**4. Final Tally of Possible Products**\nTo find the total number of unique organic products, we collect all the products formed from every possible pathway:\n1.  Aniline\n2.  2-deuteroaniline\n3.  3-deuteroaniline\n\nThere are a total of **3** possible organic products. The chemical reasoning presented in all 15 candidate answers is uniformly sound and leads to this exact conclusion.\n\nGiven the options from the problem description:\nA) 3\nB) 2\nC) 1\nD) 4\n\nThe correct choice is the one that matches the number of products, which is 3.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem and a synthesis of the candidate answers, here is a detailed breakdown.\n\nThe core of this problem lies in correctly identifying all possible reaction pathways for an elimination-addition reaction on an isotopically labeled substrate.\n\n**Step 1: Identifying the Reaction Mechanism**\nThe reactants are 1-bromobenzene-2-d (an aryl halide) and sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia. These conditions are characteristic of an **elimination-addition reaction**, which proceeds through a highly reactive **benzyne** intermediate. The amide ion (NH₂⁻) acts first as a strong base and then as a nucleophile.\n\n**Step 2: The Elimination Step and Formation of Intermediates**\nThis is the most critical part of the analysis. The reaction is initiated by the amide base abstracting a hydrogen (or its isotope, deuterium) from a position *ortho* to the bromine atom.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Two Non-Equivalent Ortho Positions.** The starting material has two distinct ortho positions relative to the bromine: the C6 position has a hydrogen atom (H), and the C2 position has a deuterium atom (D). Because H and D are different isotopes, these positions are not chemically equivalent.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Formation of Two Different Benzyne Intermediates.** Since abstraction can occur from either ortho position, two different pathways are possible, leading to two distinct benzyne intermediates.\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The base removes the proton from C6. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 forms a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 is unaffected. The resulting intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The base removes the deuteron from C2. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 forms a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is lost in this process. The resulting intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n**Step 3: The Addition Step and Formation of Products**\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) now acts as a nucleophile, attacking the reactive triple bond of each benzyne intermediate.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Symmetry of the Intermediates Determines the Product Count.** The number of products formed from each intermediate depends on its symmetry.\n    *   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (Unsymmetrical):** This intermediate is not symmetrical. Nucleophilic attack can occur at either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C6), leading to two structurally different products after protonation.\n        1.  Attack at C1 yields **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        2.  Attack at C6 yields **3-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   **Product from benzyne (Symmetrical):** This intermediate is symmetrical and has no deuterium. Nucleophilic attack at either carbon of the triple bond leads to the same single product after protonation.\n        3.  The single product is **aniline**.\n\n**Step 4: Final Tally**\nBy combining the unique organic products from all possible pathways, we find there are three structurally distinct molecules that can be formed:\n1.  Aniline\n2.  2-deuteroaniline\n3.  3-deuteroaniline\n\nTherefore, the total number of possible organic products is **3**.\n\n**Final Answer Selection**\nMatching this number to the provided options:\nA) 4\nB) 2\nC) 3\nD) 1\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided answers, here is a consolidated, step-by-step reasoning to determine the final correct answer.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type and Mechanism:**\n    *   **Reactants**: The problem describes the reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃).\n    *   **Mechanism**: The combination of an aryl halide and a very strong base like NaNH₂ is characteristic of an **elimination-addition reaction**. This mechanism proceeds through a highly reactive, transient intermediate known as **benzyne**. All candidate answers correctly identify this as the fundamental pathway.\n\n2.  **Careful Point 1: Formation of All Possible Intermediates**\n    *   The reaction is initiated by the amide ion (NH₂⁻) acting as a base. It abstracts a proton (H⁺) or a deuteron (D⁺) from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine atom.\n    *   A critical aspect of this specific problem is that the starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, has **two non-equivalent ortho positions**:\n        *   **Position C6**: Holds a standard hydrogen atom (H).\n        *   **Position C2**: Holds a deuterium atom (D), an isotope of hydrogen.\n    *   Since the question asks for all *possible* products, both deprotonation/deuteronation events must be considered, leading to two separate pathways and two distinct benzyne intermediates.\n        *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction)**: Removal of the proton from C6, followed by the loss of the bromide ion, forms a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 is untouched. The resulting intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n        *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction)**: Removal of the deuteron from C2, followed by the loss of the bromide ion, forms a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium is removed in this step. The resulting intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n3.  **Careful Point 2: Nucleophilic Attack on Each Intermediate**\n    *   The amide ion (NH₂⁻) also acts as a nucleophile, attacking the reactive triple bond of the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n    *   The number of products formed from each intermediate depends on its symmetry.\n        *   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (unsymmetrical)**: Since this intermediate is unsymmetrical, the nucleophile can attack either carbon of the triple bond, leading to two distinct products.\n            1.  Attack at C1 gives **2-deuteroaniline**.\n            2.  Attack at C6 gives **3-deuteroaniline**.\n        *   **Products from benzyne (symmetrical)**: Since this intermediate is symmetrical, attack at either carbon of the triple bond leads to a single, identical product.\n            3.  The product is **aniline**.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion and Tally**\n    *   By summing the unique products generated from all possible pathways, we find three structurally distinct organic molecules.\n    1.  Aniline\n    2.  2-deuteroaniline\n    3.  3-deuteroaniline\n    *   Therefore, the total number of possible organic products is **3**.\n\nThe analysis consistently and unanimously across all candidate answers confirms that three products are formed.

Identification of the Reaction Mechanism**\n*   **Reactants**: The substrate is 1-bromobenzene-2-d, an aryl halide with an isotopic label. The reagent is sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃), which is an extremely strong base.\n*   **Mechanism**: These reaction conditions are classic for an **elimination-addition reaction**, which proceeds through a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n*   **Careful Point**: Recognizing the benzyne mechanism is the first crucial step. All the candidate answers correctly identified this, providing a strong foundation for the analysis.\n\n**2. Step 1: The Elimination Process (Formation of Intermediates)**\n*   The reaction is initiated by the amide ion (NH₂⁻) acting as a base, abstracting a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine atom.\n*   **Careful Point**: The starting material has two non-equivalent ortho positions, which is the key to this problem.\n    *   **Position C6**: Has a standard hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   **Position C2**: Has a deuterium atom (D).\n*   This non-equivalence leads to two possible elimination pathways, forming two different benzyne intermediates. The question asks for all *possible* products, so both pathways must be considered.\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction)**: Removal of the proton from C6, followed by elimination of Br⁻, results in a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains. The intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction)**: Removal of the deuteron from C2, followed by elimination of Br⁻, results in a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium is removed in this step. The intermediate is standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n*   Conclusion for Step 1: The reaction generates a mixture of two distinct benzyne intermediates.\n\n**3. Step 2: The Addition Process (Formation of Products)**\n*   The amide ion (NH₂⁻) now acts as a nucleophile, attacking the reactive triple bond of each benzyne intermediate. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n*   **Careful Point**: The number of products from each intermediate is determined by its symmetry.\n    *   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (Pathway A)**: This intermediate is unsymmetrical. Nucleophilic attack can occur at either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C6), leading to two different products after protonation: **2-deuteroaniline** and **3-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   **Product from benzyne (Pathway B)**: This intermediate is symmetrical. Nucleophilic attack at either carbon of the triple bond leads to the same single product after protonation: **aniline**.\n\n**4. Final Tally of Possible Products**\n*   To find the total number of unique organic products, we combine the outcomes from all possible pathways:\n    1.  Aniline (from Pathway B)\n    2.  2-deuteroaniline (from Pathway A)\n    3.  3-deuteroaniline (from Pathway A)\n*   These three products are structurally distinct. Therefore, a total of 3 different organic products are possible in this reaction.\n\nThe chemical reasoning across all candidate answers is unanimous and sound, consistently concluding that 3 products are formed.\n\nMatching this numerical answer to the provided options:\nA) 4\nB) 3\nC) 2\nD) 1\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThis problem requires a detailed analysis of an elimination-addition reaction mechanism, also known as the benzyne mechanism. A systematic review of the steps, paying attention to the isotopic labeling, will reveal all possible products.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** The reaction of an aryl halide (1-bromobenzene-2-d) with a very strong base like sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia is a classic example of an elimination-addition reaction. The key intermediate in this mechanism is a highly reactive species called benzyne.\n\n2.  **Step 1: The Elimination - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n    The reaction begins with the amide ion (NH₂⁻) acting as a base, abstracting a proton (or in this case, a deuteron) from a position *ortho* to the bromine atom.\n\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Two different ortho positions.** The starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, has two non-equivalent ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n        *   Position C2, which holds a deuterium atom (D).\n        *   Position C6, which holds a regular hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   Since the question asks for all *possible* products, both abstraction pathways must be considered.\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The base removes the proton from C6. This is followed by the loss of the bromide ion from C1, creating a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 is unaffected. The resulting intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The base removes the deuteron from C2. This is followed by the loss of the bromide ion from C1, creating a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is lost in this process. The resulting intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n    *   **Conclusion of Step 1:** Two different benzyne intermediates are formed in the reaction mixture.\n\n3.  **Step 2: The Addition - Nucleophilic Attack on the Intermediates**\n    The amide ion (NH₂⁻) also acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the benzyne's triple bond.

Step 1: Elimination - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe reaction begins when the amide ion (NH₂⁻) acts as a base and removes a proton (or its isotope, a deuteron) from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine atom.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Non-Equivalent Ortho Positions**: The starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, has two distinct ortho positions.\n    *   Position C6 holds a standard hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   Position C2 holds a deuterium atom (D).\n*   **Careful Point 2: Consideration of All Possible Pathways**: Because the question asks for all *possible* organic products, both potential elimination pathways must be analyzed, regardless of their relative rates.\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction)**: The base removes the proton from C6. This is followed by the loss of the bromide ion from C1, creating a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains in place. This forms the **3-deuterobenzyne** intermediate.\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction)**: The base removes the deuteron from C2.
