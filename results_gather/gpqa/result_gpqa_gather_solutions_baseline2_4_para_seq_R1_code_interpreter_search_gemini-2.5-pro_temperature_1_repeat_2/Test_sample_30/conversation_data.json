Due to reduced steric hindrance, the *para* isomer is the major product over the *ortho* isomer.\n*   **Conclusion:** Product 1 is **p-nitrotoluene** (4-nitrotoluene).\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (*p*-nitrotoluene) is treated with manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Analysis:** This is an oxidation reaction of the benzylic methyl group. This step presents a key point of ambiguity. The reagent mixture (MnO₂/H₂SO₄) is a strong oxidizing agent capable of oxidizing the methyl group all the way to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). However, it is crucial to consider the context of the entire reaction sequence to deduce the intended product. The next step involves acetone and a base.\n*   **Logical Deduction:** If Product 2 were the carboxylic acid (*p*-nitrobenzoic acid), the next reaction would not be a standard, high-yield transformation taught in typical organic chemistry courses. If Product 2 is the aldehyde (*p*-nitrobenzaldehyde), it perfectly sets up a classic **Claisen-Schmidt condensation** in Step 3. Chemistry problems of this type are typically designed to follow a logical sequence of well-known reactions. Therefore, it is most plausible that the oxidation is intended to stop at the aldehyde stage.\n*   **Conclusion:** Product 2 is **p-nitrobenzaldehyde**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (*p*-nitrobenzaldehyde) is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a base-catalyzed crossed aldol condensation, known specifically as a Claisen-Schmidt condensation. The base (NaOH) deprotonates acetone, which has acidic α-hydrogens, to form a nucleophilic enolate ion. The aldehyde, *p*-nitrobenzaldehyde, lacks α-hydrogens and therefore acts only as the electrophile. The enolate attacks the aldehyde's carbonyl carbon. The resulting intermediate readily dehydrates (loses a water molecule) to form a very stable, extended conjugated α,β-unsaturated ketone. The *trans* (E) isomer is the thermodynamically favored and thus major product.\n*   **Conclusion:** Product 3 is **(E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n\n### **Step 4: Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of Product 3**\n*   **Molecule:** (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n*   **Structure:** O₂N-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)CH₃.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   **Conformation:** The molecule possesses an extensive conjugated π-system, involving the nitro group, the phenyl ring, the C=C double bond, and the C=O group. To maximize stability through orbital overlap, the entire heavy-atom framework (all C, N, and O atoms) is essentially planar.\n    *   **Symmetry Elements:**\n        1.  **Plane of Symmetry (σ):** The molecule has a plane of symmetry, which is the plane containing the heavy-atom backbone. A low-energy conformation of the terminal methyl group allows one of its C-H bonds to lie in this plane, with the other two hydrogens positioned as mirror images of each other above and below the plane. This is the only non-trivial symmetry element.\n        2.  **Axis of Rotation (Cₙ, n>1):** There is no rotational axis. The molecule is not symmetric end-to-end; one end is a p-nitrophenyl group, and the other is an acetyl group. A 180° rotation (C₂) would not result in an identical structure.\n        3.  **Center of Inversion (i):** The molecule is not centrosymmetric.\n*   **Point Group Assignment:** A molecule that possesses only the identity element (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ) belongs to the **Cₛ** point group.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\nThe most chemically plausible reaction pathway leads to (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one. The symmetry analysis of this molecule shows that its point group is Cₛ.\n\nMatching this conclusion to the given options:\nA) d2h\nB) cs\nC) c3\nD) c2h\n\nThe correct answer is Cₛ.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\n**Analysis of the Synthesis Pathway**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Nitration of Toluene.** Toluene reacts with nitric acid (HNO₃) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) in an electrophilic aromatic substitution. The methyl group (-CH₃) is an *ortho, para*-director. Due to lower steric hindrance, the major product is the *para*-substituted isomer. Therefore, **Product 1 is p-nitrotoluene**. All candidate answers agree on this step.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Oxidation of p-Nitrotoluene.** Product 1 is treated with manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is an oxidation of the benzylic methyl group. This step has a potential ambiguity: the methyl group could be oxidized to an aldehyde (-CHO) or further to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). To resolve this, we must consider the next step.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Condensation Reaction.** Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This set of reagents is characteristic of an aldol-type condensation.\n    *   If Product 2 were a carboxylic acid, the reaction would be an acid-base neutralization, which is a less plausible path in a multi-step synthesis problem.\n    *   If Product 2 is an aldehyde (*p*-nitrobenzaldehyde), it undergoes a classic **Claisen-Schmidt condensation** with acetone. The aldehyde has no α-hydrogens and acts as the electrophile, while the acetone enolate acts as the nucleophile. This is the most logical and chemically sound pathway.\n    *   Therefore, **Product 2 is p-nitrobenzaldehyde**.\n    *   The condensation product, after the elimination of water (dehydration), is **Product 3: (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one**. The *trans* (E) isomer is the major, most stable product.\n\n**Analysis of Molecular Symmetry**\n\n1.  **Molecule:** The final product is (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one. Its structure is `O₂N-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)CH₃`.\n\n2.  **Conformation:** The molecule features an extensive π-conjugated system (nitro group, phenyl ring, C=C double bond, C=O double bond). To maximize stability from this conjugation, the heavy-atom framework (all Carbon, Nitrogen, and Oxygen atoms) adopts a planar conformation.\n\n3.  **Symmetry Elements:**\n    *   **Identity (E):** All molecules possess this.\n    *   **Plane of Symmetry (σ):** The molecule has a single plane of symmetry, which is the plane containing the planar backbone of the molecule. One hydrogen of the terminal methyl group can lie in this plane, with the other two hydrogens positioned as mirror images of each other above and below the plane.\n    *   **Axis of Rotation (Cₙ, n>1):** There are no rotational axes. The molecule is asymmetric from one end to the other (a *p*-nitrophenyl group vs. an acetyl group).\n    *   **Center of Inversion (i):** The molecule is not centrosymmetric.\n\n4.  **Conclusion on Point Group:** A molecule that has only the identity element (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ) belongs to the **Cs** point group.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nThe chemical synthesis leads to (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.

Identify the Reaction Pathway and Products**\n\nTo determine the molecular symmetry of the final product, we must first correctly identify its structure. This involves analyzing each step of the synthesis, making the most chemically logical choices where ambiguity exists.\n\n*   **Step 1: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid, forming Product 1.**\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is a classic electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction, specifically the nitration of toluene.\n    *   **Product:** The methyl group (-CH₃) is an *ortho*, *para*-director. In a multi-step synthesis problem, it is standard practice to assume the major product is carried forward. Due to reduced steric hindrance, the *para* isomer is the major product.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Product 1 is **p-nitrotoluene** (4-nitrotoluene).\n\n*   **Step 2: Product 1 is treated with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄, forming Product 2.**\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is the oxidation of the benzylic methyl group of p-nitrotoluene.\n    *   **Resolving Ambiguity:** The reagent combination (MnO₂ in strong acid) is a powerful oxidizing agent. It could oxidize the methyl group to an aldehyde (-CHO) or further to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). To determine the intended product, we must look ahead to the next step. The subsequent reaction involves acetone and base (NaOH), which is the classic setup for a **Claisen-Schmidt condensation**. This reaction requires an aldehyde electrophile. If Product 2 were the carboxylic acid, this subsequent reaction would not proceed as described. Therefore, the most logical and cohesive pathway for the synthesis is the oxidation stopping at the aldehyde stage.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Product 2 is **p-nitrobenzaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide, forming Product 3.**\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is a base-catalyzed crossed aldol condensation (Claisen-Schmidt condensation).\n    *   **Mechanism:** The base (NaOH) deprotonates acetone, which has acidic α-hydrogens, to form a nucleophilic enolate ion. This enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of p-nitrobenzaldehyde (which lacks α-hydrogens). The initial aldol addition product readily dehydrates to form a very stable, extended conjugated α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Product 3 is the more thermodynamically stable *trans* isomer, **(E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n\n### **2. Determine the Molecular Symmetry of Product 3**\n\nNow we analyze the symmetry elements of the final product, (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one, to determine its point group.\n\n*   **Structure:** `O₂N-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)CH₃`\n*   **Conformation:** The molecule has an extensive π-conjugated system (involving the nitro group, benzene ring, C=C double bond, and C=O group). To maximize stability from this conjugation, the entire heavy-atom (C, N, O) backbone is planar.\n*   **Symmetry Element Analysis:**\n    *   **Plane of Symmetry (σ):** The molecule possesses a single plane of symmetry. This plane is co-planar with the molecule's flat backbone. The terminal methyl group can orient itself so one C-H bond lies within this plane, making the other two hydrogens mirror images of each other.\n    *   **Axis of Rotation (Cₙ, n>1):** The molecule does not have any rotational axes. A 180° rotation (C₂) along its length does not result in an identical structure because the two ends of the molecule are different (a p-nitrophenyl group vs. an acetyl group).\n    *   **Center of Inversion (i):** The molecule is not centrosymmetric and lacks a center of inversion.\n*   **Point Group Conclusion:** A molecule that possesses only the identity element (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ) belongs to the **Cₛ** point group.\n\n### **3.

This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution, specifically nitration. The methyl group is an *ortho, para*-director. In a multi-step synthesis problem, we assume the major product is carried forward. Due to lower steric hindrance, the major product is the *para* isomer. Therefore, **Product 1 is p-nitrotoluene**.\n    *   **Reaction 2: Product 1 → Product 2.** p-nitrotoluene is treated with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄. This is an oxidation of the benzylic methyl group. This could produce an aldehyde or a carboxylic acid. To determine the correct product, we must look at the next step.\n    *   **Reaction 3: Product 2 → Product 3.** Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide. This set of reagents is characteristic of a base-catalyzed aldol-type condensation. For this reaction to proceed as a standard, high-yield **Claisen-Schmidt condensation**, Product 2 must be an aldehyde (as it lacks α-hydrogens to self-condense but can act as an electrophile). If Product 2 were a carboxylic acid, the reaction would not proceed in this manner. Thus, the most logical reaction pathway is the one where the oxidation stops at the aldehyde. Therefore, **Product 2 is p-nitrobenzaldehyde**.\n    *   **Structure of Product 3:** In the final step, the enolate of acetone (formed by NaOH) attacks p-nitrobenzaldehyde.

This step presents a key point of ambiguity. The reagent mixture (MnO₂/H₂SO₄) is a strong oxidizing agent capable of oxidizing the methyl group all the way to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). However, it is crucial to consider the context of the entire reaction sequence to deduce the intended product. The next step involves acetone and a base.\n*   **Logical Deduction:** If Product 2 were the carboxylic acid (*p*-nitrobenzoic acid), the next reaction would not be a standard, high-yield transformation taught in typical organic chemistry courses. If Product 2 is the aldehyde (*p*-nitrobenzaldehyde), it perfectly sets up a classic **Claisen-Schmidt condensation** in Step 3. Chemistry problems of this type are typically designed to follow a logical sequence of well-known reactions. Therefore, it is most plausible that the oxidation is intended to stop at the aldehyde stage.\n*   **Conclusion:** Product 2 is **p-nitrobenzaldehyde**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (*p*-nitrobenzaldehyde) is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a base-catalyzed crossed aldol condensation, known specifically as a Claisen-Schmidt condensation. The base (NaOH) deprotonates acetone, which has acidic α-hydrogens, to form a nucleophilic enolate ion. The aldehyde, *p*-nitrobenzaldehyde, lacks α-hydrogens and therefore acts only as the electrophile. The enolate attacks the aldehyde's carbonyl carbon. The resulting intermediate readily dehydrates (loses a water molecule) to form a very stable, extended conjugated α,β-unsaturated ketone. The *trans* (E) isomer is the thermodynamically favored and thus major product.\n*   **Conclusion:** Product 3 is **(E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n\n### **Step 4: Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of Product 3**\n*   **Molecule:** (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n*   **Structure:** O₂N-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)CH₃.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   **Conformation:** The molecule possesses an extensive conjugated π-system, involving the nitro group, the phenyl ring, the C=C double bond, and the C=O group. To maximize stability through orbital overlap, the entire heavy-atom framework (all C, N, and O atoms) is essentially planar.\n    *   **Symmetry Elements:**\n        1.  **Plane of Symmetry (σ):** The molecule has a plane of symmetry, which is the plane containing the heavy-atom backbone. A low-energy conformation of the terminal methyl group allows one of its C-H bonds to lie in this plane, with the other two hydrogens positioned as mirror images of each other above and below the plane. This is the only non-trivial symmetry element.\n        2.  **Axis of Rotation (Cₙ, n>1):** There is no rotational axis. The molecule is not symmetric end-to-end; one end is a p-nitrophenyl group, and the other is an acetyl group. A 180° rotation (C₂) would not result in an identical structure.\n        3.  **Center of Inversion (i):** The molecule is not centrosymmetric.\n*   **Point Group Assignment:** A molecule that possesses only the identity element (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ) belongs to the **Cₛ** point group.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\nThe most chemically plausible reaction pathway leads to (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one. The symmetry analysis of this molecule shows that its point group is Cₛ.\n\nMatching this conclusion to the given options:\nA) d2h\nB) cs\nC) c3\nD) c2h\n\nThe correct answer is Cₛ.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\n**Analysis of the Synthesis Pathway**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Nitration of Toluene.** Toluene reacts with nitric acid (HNO₃) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) in an electrophilic aromatic substitution. The methyl group (-CH₃) is an *ortho, para*-director. Due to lower steric hindrance, the major product is the *para*-substituted isomer. Therefore, **Product 1 is p-nitrotoluene**. All candidate answers agree on this step.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Oxidation of p-Nitrotoluene.** Product 1 is treated with manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is an oxidation of the benzylic methyl group. This step has a potential ambiguity: the methyl group could be oxidized to an aldehyde (-CHO) or further to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). To resolve this, we must consider the next step.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Condensation Reaction.** Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This set of reagents is characteristic of an aldol-type condensation.\n    *   If Product 2 were a carboxylic acid, the reaction would be an acid-base neutralization, which is a less plausible path in a multi-step synthesis problem.\n    *   If Product 2 is an aldehyde (*p*-nitrobenzaldehyde), it undergoes a classic **Claisen-Schmidt condensation** with acetone. The aldehyde has no α-hydrogens and acts as the electrophile, while the acetone enolate acts as the nucleophile. This is the most logical and chemically sound pathway.\n    *   Therefore, **Product 2 is p-nitrobenzaldehyde**.\n    *   The condensation product, after the elimination of water (dehydration), is **Product 3: (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one**. The *trans* (E) isomer is the major, most stable product.\n\n**Analysis of Molecular Symmetry**\n\n1.  **Molecule:** The final product is (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one. Its structure is `O₂N-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)CH₃`.\n\n2.  **Conformation:** The molecule features an extensive π-conjugated system (nitro group, phenyl ring, C=C double bond, C=O double bond). To maximize stability from this conjugation, the heavy-atom framework (all Carbon, Nitrogen, and Oxygen atoms) adopts a planar conformation.\n\n3.  **Symmetry Elements:**\n    *   **Identity (E):** All molecules possess this.\n    *   **Plane of Symmetry (σ):** The molecule has a single plane of symmetry, which is the plane containing the planar backbone of the molecule. One hydrogen of the terminal methyl group can lie in this plane, with the other two hydrogens positioned as mirror images of each other above and below the plane.\n    *   **Axis of Rotation (Cₙ, n>1):** There are no rotational axes. The molecule is asymmetric from one end to the other (a *p*-nitrophenyl group vs. an acetyl group).\n    *   **Center of Inversion (i):** The molecule is not centrosymmetric.\n\n4.  **Conclusion on Point Group:** A molecule that has only the identity element (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ) belongs to the **Cs** point group.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nThe chemical synthesis leads to (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.

Identify the Reaction Pathway and Products**\n\nTo determine the molecular symmetry of the final product, we must first correctly identify its structure. This involves analyzing each step of the synthesis, making the most chemically logical choices where ambiguity exists.\n\n*   **Step 1: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid, forming Product 1.**\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is a classic electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction, specifically the nitration of toluene.\n    *   **Product:** The methyl group (-CH₃) is an *ortho*, *para*-director. In a multi-step synthesis problem, it is standard practice to assume the major product is carried forward. Due to reduced steric hindrance, the *para* isomer is the major product.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Product 1 is **p-nitrotoluene** (4-nitrotoluene).\n\n*   **Step 2: Product 1 is treated with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄, forming Product 2.**\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is the oxidation of the benzylic methyl group of p-nitrotoluene.\n    *   **Resolving Ambiguity:** The reagent combination (MnO₂ in strong acid) is a powerful oxidizing agent. It could oxidize the methyl group to an aldehyde (-CHO) or further to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). To determine the intended product, we must look ahead to the next step. The subsequent reaction involves acetone and base (NaOH), which is the classic setup for a **Claisen-Schmidt condensation**. This reaction requires an aldehyde electrophile. If Product 2 were the carboxylic acid, this subsequent reaction would not proceed as described. Therefore, the most logical and cohesive pathway for the synthesis is the oxidation stopping at the aldehyde stage.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Product 2 is **p-nitrobenzaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide, forming Product 3.**\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is a base-catalyzed crossed aldol condensation (Claisen-Schmidt condensation).\n    *   **Mechanism:** The base (NaOH) deprotonates acetone, which has acidic α-hydrogens, to form a nucleophilic enolate ion. This enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of p-nitrobenzaldehyde (which lacks α-hydrogens). The initial aldol addition product readily dehydrates to form a very stable, extended conjugated α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Product 3 is the more thermodynamically stable *trans* isomer, **(E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n\n### **2. Determine the Molecular Symmetry of Product 3**\n\nNow we analyze the symmetry elements of the final product, (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one, to determine its point group.\n\n*   **Structure:** `O₂N-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)CH₃`\n*   **Conformation:** The molecule has an extensive π-conjugated system (involving the nitro group, benzene ring, C=C double bond, and C=O group). To maximize stability from this conjugation, the entire heavy-atom (C, N, O) backbone is planar.\n*   **Symmetry Element Analysis:**\n    *   **Plane of Symmetry (σ):** The molecule possesses a single plane of symmetry. This plane is co-planar with the molecule's flat backbone. The terminal methyl group can orient itself so one C-H bond lies within this plane, making the other two hydrogens mirror images of each other.\n    *   **Axis of Rotation (Cₙ, n>1):** The molecule does not have any rotational axes. A 180° rotation (C₂) along its length does not result in an identical structure because the two ends of the molecule are different (a p-nitrophenyl group vs. an acetyl group).\n    *   **Center of Inversion (i):** The molecule is not centrosymmetric and lacks a center of inversion.\n*   **Point Group Conclusion:** A molecule that possesses only the identity element (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ) belongs to the **Cₛ** point group.\n\n### **3.

This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution, specifically nitration. The methyl group is an *ortho, para*-director. In a multi-step synthesis problem, we assume the major product is carried forward. Due to lower steric hindrance, the major product is the *para* isomer. Therefore, **Product 1 is p-nitrotoluene**.\n    *   **Reaction 2: Product 1 → Product 2.** p-nitrotoluene is treated with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄. This is an oxidation of the benzylic methyl group. This could produce an aldehyde or a carboxylic acid. To determine the correct product, we must look at the next step.\n    *   **Reaction 3: Product 2 → Product 3.** Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide. This set of reagents is characteristic of a base-catalyzed aldol-type condensation. For this reaction to proceed as a standard, high-yield **Claisen-Schmidt condensation**, Product 2 must be an aldehyde (as it lacks α-hydrogens to self-condense but can act as an electrophile). If Product 2 were a carboxylic acid, the reaction would not proceed in this manner. Thus, the most logical reaction pathway is the one where the oxidation stops at the aldehyde. Therefore, **Product 2 is p-nitrobenzaldehyde**.\n    *   **Structure of Product 3:** In the final step, the enolate of acetone (formed by NaOH) attacks p-nitrobenzaldehyde.
