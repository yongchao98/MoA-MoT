The variations in the final lettered choice are due to the multiple-choice options being presented in a different random order to each agent, not a disagreement on the numerical result.\n\nThe following is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Stellar Velocity:** The problem is solved using the Radial Velocity (RV) method. The foundational principle is that the maximum observed Doppler shift in a star's spectral line (`Δλ`) is directly proportional to the star's maximum line-of-sight velocity, known as the velocity semi-amplitude (`K`).\n    *   Physical Principle: `K ∝ Δλ`\n    *   Given data: `Δλ₁ = 5` miliangstroms and `Δλ₂ = 7` miliangstroms.\n    *   From this, we establish the ratio of the stellar velocities: `K₁ / K₂ = 5 / 7`.\n\n2.  **Relate Stellar Velocity to Orbital Period:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's velocity semi-amplitude (`K`) is related to the planet's orbital period (`P`), the planet's mass (`m_p`), and the star's mass (`M_star`). The formula is:\n    `K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3))`\n    The problem states that the star masses are the same, and the planet masses are similar. For a solvable problem with a unique answer, it is a standard assumption that the quantity measured, the minimum mass `m_p * sin(i)`, is also constant between the two systems. Under these conditions, the relationship simplifies to a key proportionality:\n    *   Simplified Principle: `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`\n    This means that a larger stellar velocity (`K`) corresponds to a shorter orbital period (`P`).\n\n3.  **Combine Ratios and Solve:** The goal is to find the ratio of the periods, `P₂ / P₁`.\n    *   Using the proportionality from Step 2, we can write:\n        `K₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3)`\n    *   This expression can be rearranged to:\n        `K₁ / K₂ = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`\n    *   To solve for the period ratio `P₂ / P₁`, we cube both sides of the equation:\n        `P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)^3`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Value:** We substitute the known ratio of the velocities (which is equal to the ratio of the wavelength shifts) into the equation.\n    ```python\n    # Calculate the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to planet #1\n    # This is equal to the cube of the ratio of the velocity semi-amplitudes (K1/K2),\n    # which is equal to the cube of the ratio of the wavelength shifts (Δλ₁/Δλ₂).\n    ratio = (5/7)**3\n    print(ratio)\n    ```\n    `P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³ = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.3644`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Correct Power Law:** It is critical to use the correct relationship, `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`, which leads to the final calculation involving cubing the velocity ratio. A common mistake could be using an incorrect exponent.\n*   **Ratio Inversion:** The question asks for `P₂ / P₁`. It's important to set up the algebra correctly to solve for this specific ratio and not its inverse, `P₁ / P₂`. Our derivation `P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)^3` is correct.\n*   **Sanity Check:** Planet #2 causes a larger wavelength shift (7 mÅ vs 5 mÅ), implying its star has a higher velocity (`K₂ > K₁`). For planets of similar mass, a higher stellar velocity implies a closer orbit. According to Kepler's Third Law, a closer orbit has a shorter period. Therefore, we should expect `P₂` to be less than `P₁`, making the ratio `P₂ / P₁` less than 1. Our result of `~0.36` is consistent with this physical intuition.\n*   **Matching the Answer:** The numerical result is consistently `~0.36`. We must match this value to the specific options listed in the original question:\n    A) ~ 0.85\n    B) ~ 0.36\n    C) ~ 1.96\n    D) ~ 1.40\n\nThe calculated value of `~0.36` corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers reveals a strong and unanimous consensus on the physical principles and the mathematical steps required to solve the problem. The discrepancy in the final letter choices among the candidates is simply due to the multiple-choice options being presented in a different random order to each agent, not a disagreement on the correct numerical result.\n\nThe following is a definitive, step-by-step derivation of the solution, incorporating careful points to avoid common errors.\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation\n\n1.  **Relate Observation (Wavelength Shift) to Physical Quantity (Velocity)**\n    The problem is based on the Radial Velocity (RV) method. The fundamental principle is that the maximum measured shift in a star's spectral line wavelength, Δλ, is directly proportional to the star's maximum line-of-sight velocity, known as the velocity semi-amplitude, *K*.\n    *   Relationship: `K ∝ Δλ`\n    *   Given Data: `Δλ₁ = 5 mÅ` and `Δλ₂ = 7 mÅ`\n    *   Ratio: From the proportionality, we can find the ratio of the stars' velocities:\n        $$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{5}{7} $$\n\n2.  **Relate Stellar Velocity (K) to Planet's Orbital Period (P)**\n    The formula for the star's velocity semi-amplitude `K` caused by a planet in a circular orbit is:\n    $$ K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_{\\text{star}}^{2/3}} $$\n    The problem states that the star masses (`M_star`) are the same, and the planet masses (`m_p`) are similar. For a solvable problem with a single answer, it's a standard assumption that the term detected by the RV method, the minimum mass (`m_p sin(i)`), is treated as a constant for both systems. With all other factors (`G`, `π`, `M_star`, `m_p sin(i)`) being constant, the formula simplifies to a crucial proportionality:\n    *   Relationship: `K ∝ P⁻¹ᐟ³` or `K ∝ 1 / (P¹ᐟ³)`\n\n3.  **Combine the Ratios and Solve for the Period Ratio**\n    The question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to planet #1 (`P₂ / P₁`). We can use the proportionality from Step 2 to establish a relationship between the ratios:\n    $$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{P_1^{-1/3}}{P_2^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n    To solve for the desired period ratio (`P₂ / P₁`), we cube both sides of the equation:\n    $$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3 $$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Value**\n    Substitute the known ratio of the velocities from Step 1 into this final equation:\n    $$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{5^3}{7^3} = \\frac{125}{343} \\approx 0.3644 $$\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Physical Intuition (Sanity Check):** Planet #2 causes a larger wavelength shift (7 vs. 5), which means its host star is moving faster (`K₂ > K₁`). According to the relationship `K ∝ P⁻¹ᐟ³`, a larger velocity must correspond to a shorter orbital period. Therefore, we should expect `P₂` to be shorter than `P₁`, and the ratio `P₂ / P₁` must be less than 1. Our calculated result of `~0.36` is consistent with this check.\n*   **Correct Proportionality:** It is crucial to use the correct power in the relationship. The velocity `K` is proportional to the period `P` to the power of **-1/3**.\n*   **Cubing, not Other Powers:** The final step requires **cubing** the velocity ratio, `(K₁ / K₂ )³`, to find the period ratio `P₂ / P₁`. Taking a cube root or any other power would be incorrect.\n*   **Handling the Ratios:** Care must be taken to keep the indices correct. The derivation `K₁/K₂ = (P₂/P₁)^⅓` correctly inverts the period ratio inside the power term.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe calculated numerical value for the ratio `P₂ / P₁` is approximately **0.36**. We now match this result to the specific list of options provided in the question:\n\n*   A) ~ 1.40\n*   B) ~ 0.85\n*   C) ~ 0.36\n*   D) ~ 1.96\n\nThe calculated value of `~0.36` perfectly matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the physical principles and mathematical steps required for the solution. The discrepancies in the final letter choices among the candidate answers are due to them being presented with differently ordered lists of options, not because of any flaw in their reasoning.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to confirm the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Relate the Observable Data to the Star's Velocity:**\n    The problem utilizes the Radial Velocity (RV) method. The core principle is that the measured maximum wavelength shift of a spectral line (`Δλ`) is directly proportional to the star's maximum line-of-sight velocity, known as the velocity semi-amplitude (`K`).\n    *   **Physical Principle:** `K ∝ Δλ`\n    *   **Given Data:** `Δλ₁ = 5` miliangstroms and `Δλ₂ = 7` miliangstroms.\n    *   **Ratio:** This proportionality allows us to establish a ratio of the stellar velocities: `K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 / 7`.\n\n2.  **Relate the Star's Velocity to the Planet's Orbital Period:**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the formula for the star's velocity semi-amplitude (`K`) is `K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3))`. The problem states several conditions that simplify this relationship:\n    *   The stars have the same mass (`M_star1 = M_star2`).\n    *   The planets have similar masses (`m_p1 ≈ m_p2`).\n    *   For the problem to be solvable with a single definitive answer, it's a standard and necessary assumption that the orbital inclination (`i`) is also similar, meaning the term `m_p * sin(i)` can be treated as a constant for both systems.\n\n    With all other terms in the equation being constant, the relationship simplifies to a crucial proportionality between `K` and the orbital period `P`:\n    *   **Simplified Principle:** `K ∝ P^(-1/3)` or `K ∝ 1 / (P^(1/3))`.\n\n3.  **Derive and Solve for the Ratio of the Orbital Periods:**\n    The question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to planet #1 (`P₂ / P₁`). We can use the proportionality from the previous step to set up an equation relating the two systems:\n    *   `K₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3)`\n    *   This can be rearranged as: `K₁ / K₂ = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`.\n\n    To solve for the desired period ratio (`P₂ / P₁`), we must isolate it by cubing both sides of the equation:\n    *   **Final Formula:** `P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)^3`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    Now we substitute the known ratio of velocities (which is equal to the ratio of wavelength shifts) into our final formula and calculate the result.\n    The code execution has confirmed the calculation:\n    `P₂ / P₁ = (5/7)³ ≈ 0.3644`\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Correct Proportionality:** The core of the problem is recognizing that the stellar velocity amplitude `K` is proportional to the inverse cube root of the orbital period `P`, i.e., `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`.\n*   **Sanity Check:** Planet #2 induces a larger wavelength shift (7 mÅ vs 5 mÅ), meaning its host star moves faster (`K₂ > K₁`). For planets of similar mass, a faster stellar wobble is caused by a stronger gravitational tug from a closer planet. According to Kepler's Third Law, a closer orbit corresponds to a shorter period. Therefore, we should expect `P₂` to be shorter than `P₁`, meaning the ratio `P₂ / P₁` must be less than 1. Our result of `~0.36` is consistent with this physical intuition.\n*   **Matching with Provided Options:** The final and most critical step is to match our calculated value to the specific list of options given in the problem statement.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe calculated value is `~0.36`.

The minor discrepancies in the final letter chosen are due to the agents being presented with differently ordered lists of options. The following step-by-step process confirms the correct numerical result and identifies important points of consideration.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift (Δλ) to Stellar Velocity (K)**: The core principle of the Radial Velocity (RV) method is that the maximum observed Doppler shift of a star's spectral line, $\\Delta\\lambda$, is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, $K$.\n    *   **Relationship:** $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda$.\n    *   **Ratio:** This means we can establish the ratio of the stellar velocities directly from the given wavelength shifts:\n        $$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{5}{7} $$\n\n2.  **Relate Stellar Velocity (K) to Orbital Period (P)**: For a planet in a circular orbit, the formula for the stellar velocity semi-amplitude is given by:\n    $$ K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_{\\text{star}}^{2/3}} $$\n    The problem simplifies this relationship by stating that star masses ($M_{\\text{star}}$) are identical and planet masses ($m_p$) are similar. To ensure the problem is solvable with a single answer, we assume the unstated orbital inclination ($i$) is also similar for both systems.\n    *   **Proportionality:** With all terms except $K$ and $P$ being constant, the formula simplifies to the crucial proportionality:\n        $$ K \\propto P^{-1/3} $$\n\n3.  **Combine the Ratios and Solve**: The question asks for the ratio of the orbital periods, $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$.\n    *   From the proportionality in the previous step, we can write:\n        $$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{(P_1)^{-1/3}}{(P_2)^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n    *   To solve for the desired period ratio, we must **cube** both sides of the equation:\n        $$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3 $$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Value**: We substitute the known ratio of velocities from Step 1 into the final equation.\n    ```python\n    # Calculate the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to planet #1.\n    ratio = (5/7)**3\n    print(ratio)\n    ```\n    The calculation yields:\n    $$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{125}{343} \\approx 0.3644 $$\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Correct Proportionality**: It is critical to use the correct relationship, `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`. A faster stellar wobble (larger K) implies a shorter orbital period (smaller P).\n*   **Correct Exponent**: The final step requires **cubing** the velocity ratio, not taking the cube root or any other power. This is a common potential mistake.\n*   **Correct Ratio Direction**: The question asks for `P₂ / P₁`. Since `K₁/K₂ = 5/7` and `P₂/P₁ = (K₁/K₂)^3`, the result must be `(5/7)³` and not `(7/5)³`.\n*   **Physical Sanity Check**: Planet #2 causes a larger wavelength shift (7 > 5), so its star is moving faster ($K_2 > K_1$). For identical star and planet masses, this implies that planet #2 is in a closer orbit. According to Kepler's Third Law, a closer orbit has a shorter period. Therefore, we should expect $P_2 < P_1$, which means the ratio $P_2 / P_1$ must be less than 1. Our result of ~0.36 is consistent with this check.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1 is approximately 0.36.

The only discrepancy among the answers is the letter choice (A, B, C, or D), which is confirmed to be a result of the multiple-choice options being presented in a different order to each agent.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the universally agreed-upon reasoning.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Relate the Observable to a Physical Quantity:** The problem is based on the Radial Velocity (RV) method. The fundamental principle is that the maximum observed shift in a star's spectral line wavelength, $\\Delta\\lambda$, is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, $K$.\n    *   This gives the proportionality: $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda$.\n    *   Using the given data ($\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ mÅ and $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ mÅ), we can find the ratio of the stars' velocity amplitudes:\n        $$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{5}{7} $$\n\n2.  **Relate the Physical Quantity to the Desired Parameter:** The star's velocity amplitude ($K$) is related to its planet's orbital period ($P$) by the formula:\n    $$ K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_{\\text{star}}^{2/3}} $$\n    The problem states that the star masses ($M_{star}$) are the same and the planet masses ($m_p$) are similar. For the problem to be solvable, it's a necessary assumption that the unstated orbital inclination term, $\\sin(i)$, is also comparable. This simplifies the equation to a core proportionality:\n    *   $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$ or $K \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{P}}$\n\n3.  **Combine Ratios and Solve:** The question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1 ($\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$). We use the proportionality from Step 2:\n    $$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{(P_1)^{-1/3}}{(P_2)^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n    To isolate the desired period ratio, we cube both sides of the equation:\n    $$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3 $$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Numerical Value:** We substitute the known ratio of velocities from Step 1 into our final equation:\n    $$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{5 \\times 5 \\times 5}{7 \\times 7 \\times 7} = \\frac{125}{343} \\approx 0.3644 $$\n    All 15 candidate answers that provided their reasoning correctly arrived at this numerical result.\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n\n*   **Sanity Check:** Star #2 causes a larger wavelength shift (7 > 5), so it must be moving faster ($K_2 > K_1$). For planets of the same mass, a faster stellar wobble is caused by a planet in a closer orbit. A closer orbit, by Kepler's Third Law, means a shorter orbital period. Therefore, we expect $P_2 < P_1$, which means the ratio $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$ must be less than 1. Our result of ~0.36 confirms this physical intuition.\n*   **Mathematical Consistency:** The correct relationship is $P \\propto K^{-3}$. The calculation requires cubing the velocity ratio, not taking the cube root or any other power. This was handled correctly in all candidate solutions.\n*   **Final Answer Selection:** The unanimously derived numerical value is approximately **0.36**.

The only discrepancy among the answers is the letter choice (A, B, C, or D), which is a result of the multiple-choice options being presented in a different order to each agent. The core reasoning and calculation are universally correct.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the key points of reasoning.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Relate the Observable Data (Wavelength Shift) to the Star's Velocity**\n\nThe problem uses the Radial Velocity (RV) method. The core principle is that the measured periodic shift in a star's spectral line wavelength ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's velocity along the line of sight. The maximum shift corresponds to the star's maximum velocity, known as the radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$).\n\n*   **Relationship:** $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda$\n*   **Data:** We have $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstroms and $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstroms.\n*   **Ratio:** The ratio of the stars' velocities is therefore the same as the ratio of their wavelength shifts:\n    $$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{5}{7} $$\n\n**Step 2: Relate the Star's Velocity ($K$) to the Planet's Orbital Period ($P$)**\n\nThe formula for a star's velocity semi-amplitude caused by a planet in a circular orbit is:\n$$ K = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{P} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_{\\text{star}}^{2/3}} $$\nThe problem gives us conditions that greatly simplify this relationship:\n*   The stars have the same mass ($M_{\\text{star1}} = M_{\\text{star2}}$).\n*   The planets have similar masses ($m_{p1} \\approx m_{p2}$).\n*   For the problem to be solvable with a unique answer, it is a standard assumption that the unstated orbital inclination ($i$) is also similar for both systems, making the detectable quantity, $m_p \\sin(i)$, the same.\n\nWith these parameters being constant, the formula simplifies to a crucial proportionality between the star's velocity and the planet's period:\n*   **Relationship:** $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\n**Step 3: Combine the Ratios and Solve for the Period Ratio ($P_2/P_1$)**\n\nUsing the proportionality from Step 2, we can set up an equation relating the two systems:\n$$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{(P_1)^{-1/3}}{(P_2)^{-1/3}} = \\left( \\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\right)^{1/3} $$\nThe question asks for the ratio of the period of planet #2 to planet #1 ($P_2/P_1$). We can now solve for this by cubing both sides of the equation:\n$$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left( \\frac{K_1}{K_2} \\right)^3 $$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Final Value**\n\nSubstitute the known velocity ratio from Step 1 into the equation from Step 3:\n$$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left( \\frac{5}{7} \\right)^3 = \\frac{5^3}{7^3} = \\frac{125}{343} \\approx 0.3644 $$\nThe numerical answer is approximately **0.36**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **The Key Proportionality:** The most critical step is simplifying the physics to the relationship $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$. This inverse relationship means a larger stellar velocity corresponds to a shorter planetary period.\n*   **Sanity Check:** Planet #2 causes a larger wavelength shift (7 > 5), so its star must be moving faster ($K_2 > K_1$). A faster-moving star (for similar planet masses) is being tugged by a planet in a closer, and therefore shorter-period, orbit. This means we must expect $P_2 < P_1$, and the ratio $P_2/P_1$ must be less than 1. Our result of ~0.36 confirms this physical intuition.\n*   **Cubing, not Cube Root:** The final step involves cubing the velocity ratio, not taking the cube root or any other power. This follows directly from isolating $P$ from the $P^{-1/3}$ term.\n*   **Keeping Ratios Straight:** It is essential to correctly define the ratios. Since the question asks for $P_2/P_1$, the derivation must be handled carefully, leading to the final form $(K_1/K_2)^3$.\n*   **Implicit Assumptions:** The solution relies on the standard assumption in such problems that unknown factors (like orbital inclination $i$) are similar for both systems, allowing the other parameters to be compared directly.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculation yields a result of ~0.36.

For the problem to be solvable with a single answer, a standard assumption is made that the unseen orbital inclinations ($i$) are also similar, making the entire term $\\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_{\\text{star}}^{2/3}}$ a constant for both systems.\n    *   **Key Proportionality:** With this simplification, the relationship reduces to:\n        $$ K \\propto P^{-1/3} $$\n\n3.  **Solve for the Period Ratio:** The question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to planet #1 ($\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$).\n    *   Using the key proportionality, we can write:\n        $$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{P_1^{-1/3}}{P_2^{-1/3}} $$\n    *   **Careful Point 2 (Exponent Rules):** Correctly manipulating the exponents is crucial.\n        $$ \\frac{P_1^{-1/3}}{P_2^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n    *   This gives us the final equation relating our knowns to our unknown:\n        $$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n    *   **Careful Point 3 (Final Operation):** To isolate the desired ratio $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$, we must cube both sides of the equation.

The variations in the final letter choices are due to the fact that each agent was presented with a shuffled list of options, not due to any error in their reasoning.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, including the key points to consider.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Relate the Observable Data (Wavelength Shift) to Stellar Velocity.**\n    The problem is solved using the Radial Velocity (RV) method. The core principle is that the maximum measured wavelength shift of a star's spectral line (`Δλ`) is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity along our line of sight (`K`).\n    *   Relationship: `K ∝ Δλ`\n    *   Given data: `Δλ₁ = 5` miliangstroms, `Δλ₂ = 7` miliangstroms.\n    *   From this, we can establish the ratio of the stars' velocities:\n        `K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 / 7`\n\n2.  **Relate Stellar Velocity to the Planet's Orbital Period.**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's velocity semi-amplitude (`K`) is related to various system parameters by the formula:\n    `K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3))`\n    The problem gives us information that allows this formula to be greatly simplified:\n    *   Star masses are identical (`M_star1 = M_star2`).\n    *   Planet masses are similar (`m_p1 ≈ m_p2`).\n    *   Based on these givens, the term `(m_p * sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3))` can be treated as a constant for both systems. This is a standard assumption for this type of problem.\n    *   The formula simplifies to the crucial proportionality: `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`. This means that a star's velocity is inversely proportional to the cube root of its planet's orbital period.\n\n3.  **Derive the Ratio of Orbital Periods.**\n    The question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to planet #1 (`P₂ / P₁`).\n    *   Using the proportionality from Step 2, we can set up the equation:\n        `K₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3)`\n    *   This can be rearranged to:\n        `K₁ / K₂ = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`\n    *   To solve for `P₂ / P₁`, we must cube both sides of the equation:\n        `P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)^3`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Numerical Value.**\n    Substitute the known ratio of velocities (which is equal to the ratio of wavelength shifts) into the final equation:\n    *   `P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³`\n    *   `P₂ / P₁ = 5³ / 7³ = 125 / 343`\n    *   `P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Correct Proportionality:** It is essential to correctly identify that `K` is proportional to `P` raised to the power of **-1/3**. A common error would be to use the wrong exponent or sign, which would lead to an incorrect final step (e.g., taking a cube root instead of cubing).\n2.  **Ratio Direction:** The question specifically asks for `P₂ / P₁`. Setting up the ratios incorrectly (e.g., as `K₂/K₁`) would lead to the inverse answer (`(7/5)³ ≈ 2.74`). The final answer must directly address the question as asked.\n3.  **Sanity Check:** A simple check ensures the result is physically sensible. Planet #2 induces a larger wavelength shift (7 vs 5 mÅ), which means its host star is moving faster (`K₂ > K₁`). For planets of the same mass, a faster stellar wobble is caused by a planet in a closer, shorter-period orbit. Therefore, we should expect `P₂` to be shorter than `P₁`, and the ratio `P₂ / P₁` must be less than 1. Our calculated result of `~0.36` is consistent with this intuition.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe calculated ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1 is **~0.36**.

Analysis of Reasoning Consensus\nThe candidate answers show an overwhelming consensus on the correct physical principles and the mathematical steps required. The minor variation in the final lettered choice is confirmed to be due to different ordering of the options presented to each agent, not any disagreement on the numerical result itself. The correct approach is to derive the answer from first principles and match it to the authoritative list of options provided in the question.\n\n### 2. Step-by-Step Derivation\n\n**Step 1: Relate the Observable (Wavelength Shift) to the Star's Velocity**\n\nThe core principle of the Radial Velocity (RV) method is the Doppler effect. The maximum observed shift in a star's spectral line wavelength, $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$, is directly proportional to the star's maximum line-of-sight velocity, known as the velocity semi-amplitude, $K$.\n\n*   **Physical Principle:** $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max}$\n*   **Given Data:** $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstroms and $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstroms.\n*   **Derived Ratio:** The ratio of the stellar velocities is the same as the ratio of their wavelength shifts:\n    $$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{5}{7} $$\n\n**Step 2: Relate the Star's Velocity to the Planet's Orbital Period**\n\nThe star's velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) is related to the planet's orbital period ($P$) by the laws of orbital mechanics. The formula for a planet in a circular orbit is:\n$$ K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_{\\text{star}}^{2/3}} $$\nThe problem states key conditions that allow for a direct comparison:\n*   The stars' masses are identical ($M_{s1} = M_{s2}$).\n*   The planets' masses are similar ($m_{p1} \\approx m_{p2}$).\n*   For the problem to have a single unique solution, we must assume that the orbital inclination ($i$) is also similar for both systems. This means the term containing masses and inclination, $\\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_{\\text{star}}^{2/3}}$, can be treated as a constant.\n\nThis simplifies the formula to a key proportionality:\n*   **Physical Principle:** $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$  or  $K \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{P}}$\n\n**Step 3: Combine Ratios and Solve for the Period Ratio**\n\nThe question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to planet #1, which is $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$. Using the proportionality from Step 2, we can establish the relationship:\n$$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{P_1^{-1/3}}{P_2^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3} $$\nTo isolate the desired period ratio, we must cube both sides of the equation:\n$$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3 $$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Final Numerical Value**\n\nSubstitute the velocity ratio from Step 1 into the equation from Step 3:\n$$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{5^3}{7^3} = \\frac{125}{343} $$\nPerforming the calculation gives:\n$$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\approx 0.3644 $$\n\n### 3. Analysis of Careful Points\n\n*   **Assumptions**: It's important to recognize the necessary assumption that the orbital inclinations ($i$) are similar, which allows the term $m_p \\sin(i)$ to be treated as a constant.\n*   **Ratio Inversion**: The relationship between $K$ and $P$ is an inverse one ($K \\propto P^{-1/3}$). It is crucial to set up the final ratio correctly as $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = (\\frac{K_1}{K_2})^3$ and not as an inverted or different power.\n*   **Sanity Check**: Planet #2 causes a larger wavelength shift (7 mÅ vs. 5 mÅ), which means star #2 is moving faster ($K_2 > K_1$). A faster \"wobble\" is caused by a stronger gravitational pull, which, for planets of the same mass, means a closer orbit. By Kepler's Third Law, a closer orbit has a shorter period. Therefore, we must expect $P_2 < P_1$, which means the ratio $P_2/P_1$ must be less than 1. Our result of ~0.36 is consistent with this physical intuition.\n\n### 4. Final Conclusion\n\nThe calculated ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1 is approximately **0.36**. This numerical result must be matched with the specific list of options provided in the question:\n\n*   A) ~ 0.36\n*   B) ~ 1.96\n*   C) ~ 0.85\n*   D) ~ 1.40\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.36 perfectly matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the candidate answers and highlighting the crucial points.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Relate the Observed Data to Physical Velocity**\n    The problem is solved using the principles of the Radial Velocity (RV) method. The foundational concept is that the maximum observed shift in a star's spectral line wavelength, $\\Delta\\lambda$, is directly proportional to the star's maximum velocity towards or away from us (the velocity semi-amplitude, $K$).\n    *   **Relationship:** $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda$\n    *   **Given Data:** $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstroms and $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstroms.\n    *   **Ratio:** This direct proportionality allows us to set up a ratio of the stars' velocities:\n        $$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{5}{7} $$\n\n2.  **Relate Stellar Velocity to the Planet's Orbital Period**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) is related to the planet's orbital period ($P$), the planet's mass ($m_p$), and the star's mass ($M_{star}$) by a formula derived from Kepler's Laws. Given the conditions in the problem (identical star masses, similar planet masses, and assuming similar orbital inclinations for a solvable problem), this complex formula simplifies to a crucial proportionality:\n    *   **Relationship:** $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$ or $K \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{P}}$\n    This means that a higher stellar velocity ($K$) is caused by a planet with a shorter orbital period ($P$).\n\n3.  **Combine the Ratios to Solve for the Period Ratio**\n    The question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to planet #1, which is $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$. We can use the proportionality from Step 2 to establish a relationship between the two systems:\n    $$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{P_1^{-1/3}}{P_2^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n    To isolate the desired period ratio $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$, we must cube both sides of the equation:\n    $$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3 $$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Numerical Value**\n    Substitute the known velocity ratio (which is equal to the wavelength shift ratio from Step 1) into the final equation:\n    $$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{5^3}{7^3} = \\frac{125}{343} $$\n    Calculating the decimal value gives:\n    $$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\approx 0.3644 $$\n    This value rounds to **~0.36**.\n\n### Careful Points & Sanity Check\n\n*   **Proportionality Power:** A critical step is using the correct relationship $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$. It's important not to miss the inverse nature or the cube root.\n*   **Correct Final Operation:** The derivation shows that the period ratio is the cube of the velocity ratio, i.e., $(\\frac{5}{7})^3$. It is not the cube root or the simple ratio itself.\n*   **Ratio Direction:** The question asks for $P_2 / P_1$. It is important to keep the indices consistent throughout the derivation to avoid accidentally calculating the inverse, $P_1 / P_2$.\n*   **Physical Sanity Check:** Planet #2 causes a larger wavelength shift (7 > 5), so its host star is moving faster ($K_2 > K_1$). For similar mass planets, a faster-moving star means the planet must have a stronger gravitational tug, implying a closer orbit. By Kepler's Third Law, a closer orbit has a shorter period. Therefore, we expect $P_2 < P_1$, meaning the ratio $P_2/P_1$ must be less than 1. Our calculated value of ~0.36 satisfies this condition.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe analysis shows with high confidence that the orbital period of planet #2 is ~0.36 times that of planet #1. All candidate answers reached this same numerical conclusion.

The variations in the final lettered choice among the agents are due to the multiple-choice options being presented in a different order, not due to any disagreement in the physics or the result.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, highlighting the key points.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Relate Observation (Wavelength Shift) to Physical Quantity (Velocity):** The problem utilizes the Radial Velocity (RV) method. The core principle is that the measured maximum shift in a star's spectral line wavelength, $\\Delta\\lambda$, is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, $K$.\n    *   **Relationship:** $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda$.\n    *   **Given Data:** $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ mÅ and $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ mÅ.\n    *   **Ratio:** This allows us to establish the ratio of the stellar velocities:\n        $$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{5}{7} $$\n\n2.  **Relate Stellar Velocity (K) to Orbital Period (P):** The formula for the stellar velocity semi-amplitude, $K$, is related to the planet's orbital period, $P$, and other system parameters. For a planet in a circular orbit:\n    $$ K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_{\\text{star}}^{2/3}} $$\n    The problem states that star masses ($M_{star}$) are the same and planet masses ($m_p$) are similar. To arrive at a single answer, it's a standard assumption in such problems that the measured term, $m_p \\sin(i)$, is also the same for both systems. With these terms being constant, the formula simplifies to a crucial proportionality:\n    *   **Simplified Relationship:** $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$.\n\n3.  **Derive the Final Formula and Calculate:** The question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to planet #1 ($P_2/P_1$). Using the proportionality from the previous step:\n    $$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{P_1^{-1/3}}{P_2^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n    To solve for the period ratio $P_2/P_1$, we must cube both sides of the equation:\n    $$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3 $$\n    Substituting the known velocity ratio gives the final calculation:\n    $$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{125}{343} \\approx 0.3644 $$\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **The Power Law:** The relationship is $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$. It is essential to use the power of -1/3 correctly, which means that solving for P leads to cubing the K ratio ($P \\propto K^{-3}$).\n*   **The Ratios:** One must be careful to keep track of the subscripts (1 and 2). Since we are solving for $P_2/P_1$, the final expression is correctly $(K_1/K_2)^3$.\n*   **Physical Sanity Check:** Planet #2 causes a larger wavelength shift (7 > 5), so its star moves faster ($K_2 > K_1$). For similar mass planets, a faster stellar wobble is caused by a planet in a closer orbit. According to Kepler's Third Law, a closer orbit means a shorter period. Therefore, we should expect $P_2$ to be shorter than $P_1$, which means the ratio $P_2/P_1$ must be less than 1. Our result of ~0.36 confirms this, while options like 1.40 or 1.96 would be physically incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1 is **~0.36**.

The core principle is that the measured maximum wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity along our line of sight (K).\n    *   This gives the proportionality: `K ∝ Δλ`.\n    *   From the given data (`Δλ₁ = 5` mÅ, `Δλ₂ = 7` mÅ), we can establish the ratio of the velocities:\n        `K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 / 7`.\n\n2.  **Relate Stellar Velocity (K) to the Planet's Orbital Period (P)**: For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula `K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3))`.\n    *   The problem simplifies this by stating that the star masses (`M_star`) are the same and the planet masses (`m_p`) are similar.\n    *   For the problem to be solvable with the given information, we must assume that the term `sin(i)` (where `i` is the orbital inclination) is also comparable for both systems.\n    *   With these factors being constant, the formula simplifies to the crucial proportionality:\n        `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`.\n    *   This means a higher stellar velocity is caused by a planet with a shorter orbital period.\n\n3.  **Combine Ratios and Solve for the Period Ratio (P₂ / P₁)**: We want to find the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1.\n    *   From the proportionality `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`, we can write:\n        `K₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3) = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`.\n    *   To solve for `P₂ / P₁`, we cube both sides of the equation:\n        `P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)^3`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Value**: We substitute the velocity ratio from Step 1 into our final equation:\n    *   `P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³ = 125 / 343`.\n    *   The numerical calculation gives: `P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644`.\n\n### Careful Points and Sanity Check\n\n*   **Sanity Check**: Star #2 causes a larger wavelength shift (7 vs. 5), so it must be moving faster (`K₂ > K₁`). For planets of the same mass, this implies planet #2 is in a closer orbit. According to Kepler's Third Law, a closer orbit has a shorter period. Therefore, we expect `P₂ < P₁`, and the ratio `P₂ / P₁` must be less than 1. Our result of `~0.36` is consistent with this.\n*   **Correct Exponent**: A common error is misremembering the exponent.

All candidates who showed their work correctly identified the underlying physics and performed the same calculation, with variations in the final letter choice stemming only from the random ordering of options they were presented.\n\nHere is a definitive step-by-step analysis to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Relate Wavelength Shift to Stellar Velocity**\n\nThe Radial Velocity (RV) method is based on the Doppler effect. The maximum observed wavelength shift of a star's spectral line ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity along the line of sight ($K$).\n\n*   This relationship is: $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda$.\n*   Therefore, the ratio of the stellar velocities can be found from the ratio of the wavelength shifts:\n    $$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{5}{7} $$\n\n**Step 2: Relate Stellar Velocity to the Planet's Orbital Period**\n\nThe formula for the stellar velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n\n$$ K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_{\\text{star}}^{2/3}} $$\n\nThe problem states that the star masses ($M_{star}$) are the same, and the planet masses ($m_p$) are similar. For a solvable problem with a unique answer, it's a standard assumption that the unobserved orbital inclination ($i$) is also similar for both systems. With these terms being constant, the formula simplifies to a crucial proportionality between the star's velocity and the planet's orbital period ($P$):\n\n$$ K \\propto P^{-1/3} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad K \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{P}} $$\n\n**Step 3: Combine Ratios and Solve for the Period Ratio**\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to planet #1, which is $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$. Using the proportionality from Step 2:\n\n$$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{P_1^{-1/3}}{P_2^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n\nTo solve for the period ratio ($\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$), we cube both sides of the equation:\n\n$$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3 $$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Final Value**\n\nSubstitute the known ratio of velocities from Step 1 into the equation from Step 3:\n\n$$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{5^3}{7^3} = \\frac{125}{343} \\approx 0.3644 $$\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Correct Proportionality:** It is essential to recognize that `K` is inversely proportional to the cube root of `P`, not directly proportional or related by a different power. A larger velocity means a shorter period.\n2.  **Handling the Ratios:** Ensure the indices (1 and 2) are tracked correctly. The final formula for `P₂/P₁` depends on `(K₁/K₂)^3`. Accidentally flipping the ratio to `(K₂/K₁)^3` would yield the inverse answer (~2.74), which is incorrect.\n3.  **The Hidden Assumption:** The problem is solvable because key parameters (star mass, planet mass) are the same or similar, leading to the assumption that the quantity `m_p sin(i) / M_star^(2/3)` is constant for both systems.\n4.  **Sanity Check:** Star #2 produces a larger wavelength shift (7 vs. 5), so `K₂ > K₁`. This implies a stronger gravitational tug from a planet in a closer orbit. A closer orbit, by Kepler's Third Law, means a shorter orbital period. Therefore, we expect `P₂` to be shorter than `P₁`, so the ratio `P₂/P₁` must be less than 1. Our calculated result of ~0.36 is consistent with this check.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculation consistently yields a value of approximately **0.36**.

The discrepancy in the final letter chosen by each agent is due to the multiple-choice options being presented to them in a different, randomized order. The task is to synthesize the correct reasoning, perform the calculation, and match the result to the specific option list provided in the question prompt.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Relate Observation (Wavelength Shift) to Physical Quantity (Stellar Velocity)**\n    The foundation of the Radial Velocity (RV) method is the Doppler effect. The maximum observed shift in a star's spectral line wavelength, $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$, is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, $K$.\n    *   Relationship: $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max}$\n    *   Given Data: $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstroms; $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstroms.\n    *   Conclusion: The ratio of the stellar velocities is the same as the ratio of the wavelength shifts: $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{5}{7}$.\n\n2.  **Relate Stellar Velocity (K) to the Planet's Orbital Period (P)**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the formula for the star's velocity semi-amplitude is:\n    $$ K = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{P} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_{\\text{star}}^{2/3}} $$\n    The problem provides crucial simplifying conditions: the stars have identical masses ($M_{star1} = M_{star2}$) and the planets have similar masses ($m_{p1} \\approx m_{p2}$). For the problem to be uniquely solvable, we make the standard assumption that the orbital inclinations ($i$) are also similar, making the `(m_p sin(i))` term effectively constant.\n    *   Relationship: With other terms constant, the formula simplifies to the proportionality $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$. This means that a star moving at a higher velocity is orbited by a planet with a shorter period.\n\n3.  **Combine Ratios to Solve for the Period Ratio**\n    The question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1 ($\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$). We use the proportionality from the previous step:\n    $$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{P_1^{-1/3}}{P_2^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n    To isolate the desired period ratio, we must cube both sides of the equation:\n    $$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3 $$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Value**\n    Substitute the known ratio of velocities into the final equation:\n    $$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{5^3}{7^3} = \\frac{125}{343} \\approx 0.3644 $$\n\n### Careful Points and Final Decision\n\n*   **Sanity Check:** Planet #2 causes a larger wavelength shift (7 mÅ > 5 mÅ), meaning its host star moves faster ($K_2 > K_1$). For planets of the same mass, a faster stellar wobble is caused by a planet in a closer orbit. According to Kepler's Third Law, a closer orbit has a shorter period. Therefore, we expect $P_2$ to be shorter than $P_1$, and the ratio $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$ must be less than 1. Our result of ~0.36 is consistent with this physical reasoning.\n*   **Avoiding Errors:** A common error is to invert the ratio. If we had calculated $(\\frac{7}{5})^3$, the answer would be ~1.96, which matches option B but is physically incorrect. The careful setup of the ratios is crucial.\n*   **Final Match:** The numerical calculation yields ~0.36. We must match this result to the specific list of options presented in the question:\n    A) ~ 0.85\n    B) ~ 1.96\n    C) ~ 1.40\n    D) ~ 0.36\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.36 matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nAn analysis of the provided candidate answers reveals a strong and correct consensus on the physical principles and mathematical steps required to solve the problem. The discrepancies in the final lettered choices are solely due to the agents being presented with shuffled multiple-choice options, not any error in their reasoning.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the universally agreed-upon solution path.\n\n**Step 1: Relate Observational Data to Stellar Velocity**\n\nThe problem uses the Radial Velocity (RV) method. The core principle is that the maximum shift in a star's spectral line wavelength ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's maximum line-of-sight velocity, known as the velocity semi-amplitude ($K$).\n\n*   **Principle:** $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda$\n*   **Data:**\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstroms\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstroms\n*   **Ratio:** This direct proportionality means the ratio of the velocities is the same as the ratio of the wavelength shifts:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\n**Step 2: Relate Stellar Velocity to the Planet's Orbital Period**\n\nThe formula for the stellar velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) induced by a planet in a circular orbit is $K = (\\frac{2\\pi G}{P})^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_{\\text{star}}^{2/3}}$.\n\nThe problem states that star masses ($M_{star}$) are the same, and planet masses ($m_p$) are similar. For the problem to have a unique solution, it is a standard and necessary assumption that the unseen orbital inclination factor ($\\sin(i)$) is also similar, meaning the entire term $m_p \\sin(i) / M_{\\text{star}}^{2/3}$ is a constant for both systems.\n\n*   **Principle:** With the other terms constant, the relationship simplifies to an inverse proportionality between the star's velocity and the cube root of the planet's period:\n    $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\n**Step 3: Combine Ratios and Solve for the Period Ratio**\n\nThe goal is to find the ratio of the period of planet #2 to planet #1 ($\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$).\n\n*   **Derivation:** We can use the proportionality from Step 2 to set up an equation:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{P_1^{-1/3}}{P_2^{-1/3}} = (\\frac{P_1}{P_2})^{-1/3} = (\\frac{P_2}{P_1})^{1/3}$\n*   **Solving for the target ratio:** We can equate our known velocity ratio with the period ratio expression and solve for $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$ by cubing both sides:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = (\\frac{K_1}{K_2})^3$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Final Numerical Value**\n\nSubstitute the value of the velocity ratio from Step 1 into the final equation.\n\n*   **Calculation:**\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = (\\frac{5}{7})^3 = \\frac{5 \\times 5 \\times 5}{7 \\times 7 \\times 7} = \\frac{125}{343} \\approx 0.3644$\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Correct Proportionality:** It is crucial to use the correct relationship $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$. A mistake here (e.g., using a direct proportion or a different exponent) would lead to an incorrect answer.\n2.  **Correct Ratio Setup:** The question asks for the period of #2 relative to #1 ($P_2/P_1$). Care must be taken to keep the indices consistent throughout the derivation.\n3.  **Sanity Check:** Star #2 induces a larger wavelength shift ($7 > 5$), which means star #2 moves faster ($K_2 > K_1$). For identical star and planet masses, a faster \"wobble\" is caused by a planet in a closer orbit. According to Kepler's Third Law, a closer orbit has a shorter period. Therefore, we must have $P_2 < P_1$, which means the ratio $P_2/P_1$ must be less than 1.

The variations in the final lettered choice are due to the multiple-choice options being presented in a different random order to each agent, not a disagreement on the numerical result.\n\nThe following is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Stellar Velocity:** The problem is solved using the Radial Velocity (RV) method. The foundational principle is that the maximum observed Doppler shift in a star's spectral line (`Δλ`) is directly proportional to the star's maximum line-of-sight velocity, known as the velocity semi-amplitude (`K`).\n    *   Physical Principle: `K ∝ Δλ`\n    *   Given data: `Δλ₁ = 5` miliangstroms and `Δλ₂ = 7` miliangstroms.\n    *   From this, we establish the ratio of the stellar velocities: `K₁ / K₂ = 5 / 7`.\n\n2.  **Relate Stellar Velocity to Orbital Period:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's velocity semi-amplitude (`K`) is related to the planet's orbital period (`P`), the planet's mass (`m_p`), and the star's mass (`M_star`). The formula is:\n    `K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3))`\n    The problem states that the star masses are the same, and the planet masses are similar. For a solvable problem with a unique answer, it is a standard assumption that the quantity measured, the minimum mass `m_p * sin(i)`, is also constant between the two systems. Under these conditions, the relationship simplifies to a key proportionality:\n    *   Simplified Principle: `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`\n    This means that a larger stellar velocity (`K`) corresponds to a shorter orbital period (`P`).\n\n3.  **Combine Ratios and Solve:** The goal is to find the ratio of the periods, `P₂ / P₁`.\n    *   Using the proportionality from Step 2, we can write:\n        `K₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3)`\n    *   This expression can be rearranged to:\n        `K₁ / K₂ = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`\n    *   To solve for the period ratio `P₂ / P₁`, we cube both sides of the equation:\n        `P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)^3`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Value:** We substitute the known ratio of the velocities (which is equal to the ratio of the wavelength shifts) into the equation.\n    ```python\n    # Calculate the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to planet #1\n    # This is equal to the cube of the ratio of the velocity semi-amplitudes (K1/K2),\n    # which is equal to the cube of the ratio of the wavelength shifts (Δλ₁/Δλ₂).\n    ratio = (5/7)**3\n    print(ratio)\n    ```\n    `P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³ = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.3644`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Correct Power Law:** It is critical to use the correct relationship, `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`, which leads to the final calculation involving cubing the velocity ratio. A common mistake could be using an incorrect exponent.\n*   **Ratio Inversion:** The question asks for `P₂ / P₁`. It's important to set up the algebra correctly to solve for this specific ratio and not its inverse, `P₁ / P₂`. Our derivation `P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)^3` is correct.\n*   **Sanity Check:** Planet #2 causes a larger wavelength shift (7 mÅ vs 5 mÅ), implying its star has a higher velocity (`K₂ > K₁`). For planets of similar mass, a higher stellar velocity implies a closer orbit. According to Kepler's Third Law, a closer orbit has a shorter period. Therefore, we should expect `P₂` to be less than `P₁`, making the ratio `P₂ / P₁` less than 1.

The discrepancy in the final letter choices among the candidates is simply due to the multiple-choice options being presented in a different random order to each agent, not a disagreement on the correct numerical result.\n\nThe following is a definitive, step-by-step derivation of the solution, incorporating careful points to avoid common errors.\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation\n\n1.  **Relate Observation (Wavelength Shift) to Physical Quantity (Velocity)**\n    The problem is based on the Radial Velocity (RV) method. The fundamental principle is that the maximum measured shift in a star's spectral line wavelength, Δλ, is directly proportional to the star's maximum line-of-sight velocity, known as the velocity semi-amplitude, *K*.\n    *   Relationship: `K ∝ Δλ`\n    *   Given Data: `Δλ₁ = 5 mÅ` and `Δλ₂ = 7 mÅ`\n    *   Ratio: From the proportionality, we can find the ratio of the stars' velocities:\n        $$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{5}{7} $$\n\n2.  **Relate Stellar Velocity (K) to Planet's Orbital Period (P)**\n    The formula for the star's velocity semi-amplitude `K` caused by a planet in a circular orbit is:\n    $$ K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_{\\text{star}}^{2/3}} $$\n    The problem states that the star masses (`M_star`) are the same, and the planet masses (`m_p`) are similar. For a solvable problem with a single answer, it's a standard assumption that the term detected by the RV method, the minimum mass (`m_p sin(i)`), is treated as a constant for both systems. With all other factors (`G`, `π`, `M_star`, `m_p sin(i)`) being constant, the formula simplifies to a crucial proportionality:\n    *   Relationship: `K ∝ P⁻¹ᐟ³` or `K ∝ 1 / (P¹ᐟ³)`\n\n3.  **Combine the Ratios and Solve for the Period Ratio**\n    The question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to planet #1 (`P₂ / P₁`). We can use the proportionality from Step 2 to establish a relationship between the ratios:\n    $$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{P_1^{-1/3}}{P_2^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n    To solve for the desired period ratio (`P₂ / P₁`), we cube both sides of the equation:\n    $$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3 $$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Value**\n    Substitute the known ratio of the velocities from Step 1 into this final equation:\n    $$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{5^3}{7^3} = \\frac{125}{343} \\approx 0.3644 $$\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Physical Intuition (Sanity Check):** Planet #2 causes a larger wavelength shift (7 vs. 5), which means its host star is moving faster (`K₂ > K₁`). According to the relationship `K ∝ P⁻¹ᐟ³`, a larger velocity must correspond to a shorter orbital period. Therefore, we should expect `P₂` to be shorter than `P₁`, and the ratio `P₂ / P₁` must be less than 1. Our calculated result of `~0.36` is consistent with this check.\n*   **Correct Proportionality:** It is crucial to use the correct power in the relationship. The velocity `K` is proportional to the period `P` to the power of **-1/3**.\n*   **Cubing, not Other Powers:** The final step requires **cubing** the velocity ratio, `(K₁ / K₂ )³`, to find the period ratio `P₂ / P₁`. Taking a cube root or any other power would be incorrect.\n*   **Handling the Ratios:** Care must be taken to keep the indices correct. The derivation `K₁/K₂ = (P₂/P₁)^⅓` correctly inverts the period ratio inside the power term.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe calculated numerical value for the ratio `P₂ / P₁` is approximately **0.36**. We now match this result to the specific list of options provided in the question:\n\n*   A) ~ 1.40\n*   B) ~ 0.85\n*   C) ~ 0.36\n*   D) ~ 1.96\n\nThe calculated value of `~0.36` perfectly matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the physical principles and mathematical steps required for the solution. The discrepancies in the final letter choices among the candidate answers are due to them being presented with differently ordered lists of options, not because of any flaw in their reasoning.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to confirm the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Relate the Observable Data to the Star's Velocity:**\n    The problem utilizes the Radial Velocity (RV) method. The core principle is that the measured maximum wavelength shift of a spectral line (`Δλ`) is directly proportional to the star's maximum line-of-sight velocity, known as the velocity semi-amplitude (`K`).\n    *   **Physical Principle:** `K ∝ Δλ`\n    *   **Given Data:** `Δλ₁ = 5` miliangstroms and `Δλ₂ = 7` miliangstroms.\n    *   **Ratio:** This proportionality allows us to establish a ratio of the stellar velocities: `K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 / 7`.\n\n2.  **Relate the Star's Velocity to the Planet's Orbital Period:**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the formula for the star's velocity semi-amplitude (`K`) is `K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3))`. The problem states several conditions that simplify this relationship:\n    *   The stars have the same mass (`M_star1 = M_star2`).\n    *   The planets have similar masses (`m_p1 ≈ m_p2`).\n    *   For the problem to be solvable with a single definitive answer, it's a standard and necessary assumption that the orbital inclination (`i`) is also similar, meaning the term `m_p * sin(i)` can be treated as a constant for both systems.\n\n    With all other terms in the equation being constant, the relationship simplifies to a crucial proportionality between `K` and the orbital period `P`:\n    *   **Simplified Principle:** `K ∝ P^(-1/3)` or `K ∝ 1 / (P^(1/3))`.\n\n3.  **Derive and Solve for the Ratio of the Orbital Periods:**\n    The question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to planet #1 (`P₂ / P₁`). We can use the proportionality from the previous step to set up an equation relating the two systems:\n    *   `K₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3)`\n    *   This can be rearranged as: `K₁ / K₂ = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`.\n\n    To solve for the desired period ratio (`P₂ / P₁`), we must isolate it by cubing both sides of the equation:\n    *   **Final Formula:** `P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)^3`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    Now we substitute the known ratio of velocities (which is equal to the ratio of wavelength shifts) into our final formula and calculate the result.\n    The code execution has confirmed the calculation:\n    `P₂ / P₁ = (5/7)³ ≈ 0.3644`\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Correct Proportionality:** The core of the problem is recognizing that the stellar velocity amplitude `K` is proportional to the inverse cube root of the orbital period `P`, i.e., `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`.\n*   **Sanity Check:** Planet #2 induces a larger wavelength shift (7 mÅ vs 5 mÅ), meaning its host star moves faster (`K₂ > K₁`). For planets of similar mass, a faster stellar wobble is caused by a stronger gravitational tug from a closer planet. According to Kepler's Third Law, a closer orbit corresponds to a shorter period. Therefore, we should expect `P₂` to be shorter than `P₁`, meaning the ratio `P₂ / P₁` must be less than 1. Our result of `~0.36` is consistent with this physical intuition.\n*   **Matching with Provided Options:** The final and most critical step is to match our calculated value to the specific list of options given in the problem statement.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe calculated value is `~0.36`. We now compare this to the provided options:\n\nA) ~ 1.40\nB) ~ 0.85\nC) ~ 0.36\nD) ~ 1.96\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.36 matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers reveals a strong and correct consensus on the underlying physics and the necessary calculation. The minor discrepancies in the final letter chosen are due to the agents being presented with differently ordered lists of options. The following step-by-step process confirms the correct numerical result and identifies important points of consideration.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift (Δλ) to Stellar Velocity (K)**: The core principle of the Radial Velocity (RV) method is that the maximum observed Doppler shift of a star's spectral line, $\\Delta\\lambda$, is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, $K$.\n    *   **Relationship:** $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda$.\n    *   **Ratio:** This means we can establish the ratio of the stellar velocities directly from the given wavelength shifts:\n        $$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{5}{7} $$\n\n2.  **Relate Stellar Velocity (K) to Orbital Period (P)**: For a planet in a circular orbit, the formula for the stellar velocity semi-amplitude is given by:\n    $$ K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_{\\text{star}}^{2/3}} $$\n    The problem simplifies this relationship by stating that star masses ($M_{\\text{star}}$) are identical and planet masses ($m_p$) are similar. To ensure the problem is solvable with a single answer, we assume the unstated orbital inclination ($i$) is also similar for both systems.\n    *   **Proportionality:** With all terms except $K$ and $P$ being constant, the formula simplifies to the crucial proportionality:\n        $$ K \\propto P^{-1/3} $$\n\n3.  **Combine the Ratios and Solve**: The question asks for the ratio of the orbital periods, $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$.\n    *   From the proportionality in the previous step, we can write:\n        $$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{(P_1)^{-1/3}}{(P_2)^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n    *   To solve for the desired period ratio, we must **cube** both sides of the equation:\n        $$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3 $$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Value**: We substitute the known ratio of velocities from Step 1 into the final equation.\n    ```python\n    # Calculate the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to planet #1.\n    ratio = (5/7)**3\n    print(ratio)\n    ```\n    The calculation yields:\n    $$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{125}{343} \\approx 0.3644 $$\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Correct Proportionality**: It is critical to use the correct relationship, `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`. A faster stellar wobble (larger K) implies a shorter orbital period (smaller P).\n*   **Correct Exponent**: The final step requires **cubing** the velocity ratio, not taking the cube root or any other power. This is a common potential mistake.\n*   **Correct Ratio Direction**: The question asks for `P₂ / P₁`. Since `K₁/K₂ = 5/7` and `P₂/P₁ = (K₁/K₂)^3`, the result must be `(5/7)³` and not `(7/5)³`.\n*   **Physical Sanity Check**: Planet #2 causes a larger wavelength shift (7 > 5), so its star is moving faster ($K_2 > K_1$). For identical star and planet masses, this implies that planet #2 is in a closer orbit. According to Kepler's Third Law, a closer orbit has a shorter period. Therefore, we should expect $P_2 < P_1$, which means the ratio $P_2 / P_1$ must be less than 1. Our result of ~0.36 is consistent with this check.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1 is approximately 0.36.

The fundamental principle is that the maximum observed shift in a star's spectral line wavelength, $\\Delta\\lambda$, is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, $K$.\n    *   This gives the proportionality: $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda$.\n    *   Using the given data ($\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ mÅ and $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ mÅ), we can find the ratio of the stars' velocity amplitudes:\n        $$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{5}{7} $$\n\n2.  **Relate the Physical Quantity to the Desired Parameter:** The star's velocity amplitude ($K$) is related to its planet's orbital period ($P$) by the formula:\n    $$ K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_{\\text{star}}^{2/3}} $$\n    The problem states that the star masses ($M_{star}$) are the same and the planet masses ($m_p$) are similar. For the problem to be solvable, it's a necessary assumption that the unstated orbital inclination term, $\\sin(i)$, is also comparable. This simplifies the equation to a core proportionality:\n    *   $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$ or $K \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{P}}$\n\n3.  **Combine Ratios and Solve:** The question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1 ($\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$). We use the proportionality from Step 2:\n    $$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{(P_1)^{-1/3}}{(P_2)^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n    To isolate the desired period ratio, we cube both sides of the equation:\n    $$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3 $$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Numerical Value:** We substitute the known ratio of velocities from Step 1 into our final equation:\n    $$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{5 \\times 5 \\times 5}{7 \\times 7 \\times 7} = \\frac{125}{343} \\approx 0.3644 $$\n    All 15 candidate answers that provided their reasoning correctly arrived at this numerical result.\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n\n*   **Sanity Check:** Star #2 causes a larger wavelength shift (7 > 5), so it must be moving faster ($K_2 > K_1$). For planets of the same mass, a faster stellar wobble is caused by a planet in a closer orbit. A closer orbit, by Kepler's Third Law, means a shorter orbital period. Therefore, we expect $P_2 < P_1$, which means the ratio $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$ must be less than 1. Our result of ~0.36 confirms this physical intuition.\n*   **Mathematical Consistency:** The correct relationship is $P \\propto K^{-3}$.

The only discrepancy among the answers is the letter choice (A, B, C, or D), which is a result of the multiple-choice options being presented in a different order to each agent. The core reasoning and calculation are universally correct.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the key points of reasoning.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Relate the Observable Data (Wavelength Shift) to the Star's Velocity**\n\nThe problem uses the Radial Velocity (RV) method. The core principle is that the measured periodic shift in a star's spectral line wavelength ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's velocity along the line of sight. The maximum shift corresponds to the star's maximum velocity, known as the radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$).\n\n*   **Relationship:** $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda$\n*   **Data:** We have $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstroms and $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstroms.\n*   **Ratio:** The ratio of the stars' velocities is therefore the same as the ratio of their wavelength shifts:\n    $$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{5}{7} $$\n\n**Step 2: Relate the Star's Velocity ($K$) to the Planet's Orbital Period ($P$)**\n\nThe formula for a star's velocity semi-amplitude caused by a planet in a circular orbit is:\n$$ K = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{P} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_{\\text{star}}^{2/3}} $$\nThe problem gives us conditions that greatly simplify this relationship:\n*   The stars have the same mass ($M_{\\text{star1}} = M_{\\text{star2}}$).\n*   The planets have similar masses ($m_{p1} \\approx m_{p2}$).\n*   For the problem to be solvable with a unique answer, it is a standard assumption that the unstated orbital inclination ($i$) is also similar for both systems, making the detectable quantity, $m_p \\sin(i)$, the same.\n\nWith these parameters being constant, the formula simplifies to a crucial proportionality between the star's velocity and the planet's period:\n*   **Relationship:** $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\n**Step 3: Combine the Ratios and Solve for the Period Ratio ($P_2/P_1$)**\n\nUsing the proportionality from Step 2, we can set up an equation relating the two systems:\n$$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{(P_1)^{-1/3}}{(P_2)^{-1/3}} = \\left( \\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\right)^{1/3} $$\nThe question asks for the ratio of the period of planet #2 to planet #1 ($P_2/P_1$). We can now solve for this by cubing both sides of the equation:\n$$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left( \\frac{K_1}{K_2} \\right)^3 $$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Final Value**\n\nSubstitute the known velocity ratio from Step 1 into the equation from Step 3:\n$$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left( \\frac{5}{7} \\right)^3 = \\frac{5^3}{7^3} = \\frac{125}{343} \\approx 0.3644 $$\nThe numerical answer is approximately **0.36**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **The Key Proportionality:** The most critical step is simplifying the physics to the relationship $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$. This inverse relationship means a larger stellar velocity corresponds to a shorter planetary period.\n*   **Sanity Check:** Planet #2 causes a larger wavelength shift (7 > 5), so its star must be moving faster ($K_2 > K_1$). A faster-moving star (for similar planet masses) is being tugged by a planet in a closer, and therefore shorter-period, orbit. This means we must expect $P_2 < P_1$, and the ratio $P_2/P_1$ must be less than 1. Our result of ~0.36 confirms this physical intuition.\n*   **Cubing, not Cube Root:** The final step involves cubing the velocity ratio, not taking the cube root or any other power. This follows directly from isolating $P$ from the $P^{-1/3}$ term.\n*   **Keeping Ratios Straight:** It is essential to correctly define the ratios. Since the question asks for $P_2/P_1$, the derivation must be handled carefully, leading to the final form $(K_1/K_2)^3$.\n*   **Implicit Assumptions:** The solution relies on the standard assumption in such problems that unknown factors (like orbital inclination $i$) are similar for both systems, allowing the other parameters to be compared directly.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculation yields a result of ~0.36.

The core principle is that the maximum measured wavelength shift of a star's spectral line (`Δλ`) is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity along our line of sight (`K`).\n    *   Relationship: `K ∝ Δλ`\n    *   Given data: `Δλ₁ = 5` miliangstroms, `Δλ₂ = 7` miliangstroms.\n    *   From this, we can establish the ratio of the stars' velocities:\n        `K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 / 7`\n\n2.  **Relate Stellar Velocity to the Planet's Orbital Period.**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's velocity semi-amplitude (`K`) is related to various system parameters by the formula:\n    `K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3))`\n    The problem gives us information that allows this formula to be greatly simplified:\n    *   Star masses are identical (`M_star1 = M_star2`).\n    *   Planet masses are similar (`m_p1 ≈ m_p2`).\n    *   Based on these givens, the term `(m_p * sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3))` can be treated as a constant for both systems. This is a standard assumption for this type of problem.\n    *   The formula simplifies to the crucial proportionality: `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`. This means that a star's velocity is inversely proportional to the cube root of its planet's orbital period.\n\n3.  **Derive the Ratio of Orbital Periods.**\n    The question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to planet #1 (`P₂ / P₁`).\n    *   Using the proportionality from Step 2, we can set up the equation:\n        `K₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3)`\n    *   This can be rearranged to:\n        `K₁ / K₂ = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`\n    *   To solve for `P₂ / P₁`, we must cube both sides of the equation:\n        `P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)^3`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Numerical Value.**\n    Substitute the known ratio of velocities (which is equal to the ratio of wavelength shifts) into the final equation:\n    *   `P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³`\n    *   `P₂ / P₁ = 5³ / 7³ = 125 / 343`\n    *   `P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Correct Proportionality:** It is essential to correctly identify that `K` is proportional to `P` raised to the power of **-1/3**. A common error would be to use the wrong exponent or sign, which would lead to an incorrect final step (e.g., taking a cube root instead of cubing).\n2.  **Ratio Direction:** The question specifically asks for `P₂ / P₁`. Setting up the ratios incorrectly (e.g., as `K₂/K₁`) would lead to the inverse answer (`(7/5)³ ≈ 2.74`). The final answer must directly address the question as asked.\n3.  **Sanity Check:** A simple check ensures the result is physically sensible. Planet #2 induces a larger wavelength shift (7 vs 5 mÅ), which means its host star is moving faster (`K₂ > K₁`). For planets of the same mass, a faster stellar wobble is caused by a planet in a closer, shorter-period orbit. Therefore, we should expect `P₂` to be shorter than `P₁`, and the ratio `P₂ / P₁` must be less than 1. Our calculated result of `~0.36` is consistent with this intuition.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe calculated ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1 is **~0.36**.

Analysis of Reasoning Consensus\nThe candidate answers show an overwhelming consensus on the correct physical principles and the mathematical steps required. The minor variation in the final lettered choice is confirmed to be due to different ordering of the options presented to each agent, not any disagreement on the numerical result itself. The correct approach is to derive the answer from first principles and match it to the authoritative list of options provided in the question.\n\n### 2. Step-by-Step Derivation\n\n**Step 1: Relate the Observable (Wavelength Shift) to the Star's Velocity**\n\nThe core principle of the Radial Velocity (RV) method is the Doppler effect. The maximum observed shift in a star's spectral line wavelength, $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$, is directly proportional to the star's maximum line-of-sight velocity, known as the velocity semi-amplitude, $K$.\n\n*   **Physical Principle:** $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max}$\n*   **Given Data:** $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstroms and $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstroms.\n*   **Derived Ratio:** The ratio of the stellar velocities is the same as the ratio of their wavelength shifts:\n    $$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{5}{7} $$\n\n**Step 2: Relate the Star's Velocity to the Planet's Orbital Period**\n\nThe star's velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) is related to the planet's orbital period ($P$) by the laws of orbital mechanics. The formula for a planet in a circular orbit is:\n$$ K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_{\\text{star}}^{2/3}} $$\nThe problem states key conditions that allow for a direct comparison:\n*   The stars' masses are identical ($M_{s1} = M_{s2}$).\n*   The planets' masses are similar ($m_{p1} \\approx m_{p2}$).\n*   For the problem to have a single unique solution, we must assume that the orbital inclination ($i$) is also similar for both systems. This means the term containing masses and inclination, $\\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_{\\text{star}}^{2/3}}$, can be treated as a constant.\n\nThis simplifies the formula to a key proportionality:\n*   **Physical Principle:** $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$  or  $K \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{P}}$\n\n**Step 3: Combine Ratios and Solve for the Period Ratio**\n\nThe question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to planet #1, which is $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$. Using the proportionality from Step 2, we can establish the relationship:\n$$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{P_1^{-1/3}}{P_2^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3} $$\nTo isolate the desired period ratio, we must cube both sides of the equation:\n$$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3 $$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Final Numerical Value**\n\nSubstitute the velocity ratio from Step 1 into the equation from Step 3:\n$$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{5^3}{7^3} = \\frac{125}{343} $$\nPerforming the calculation gives:\n$$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\approx 0.3644 $$\n\n### 3. Analysis of Careful Points\n\n*   **Assumptions**: It's important to recognize the necessary assumption that the orbital inclinations ($i$) are similar, which allows the term $m_p \\sin(i)$ to be treated as a constant.\n*   **Ratio Inversion**: The relationship between $K$ and $P$ is an inverse one ($K \\propto P^{-1/3}$). It is crucial to set up the final ratio correctly as $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = (\\frac{K_1}{K_2})^3$ and not as an inverted or different power.\n*   **Sanity Check**: Planet #2 causes a larger wavelength shift (7 mÅ vs. 5 mÅ), which means star #2 is moving faster ($K_2 > K_1$). A faster \"wobble\" is caused by a stronger gravitational pull, which, for planets of the same mass, means a closer orbit. By Kepler's Third Law, a closer orbit has a shorter period. Therefore, we must expect $P_2 < P_1$, which means the ratio $P_2/P_1$ must be less than 1. Our result of ~0.36 is consistent with this physical intuition.\n\n### 4. Final Conclusion\n\nThe calculated ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1 is approximately **0.36**. This numerical result must be matched with the specific list of options provided in the question:\n\n*   A) ~ 0.36\n*   B) ~ 1.96\n*   C) ~ 0.85\n*   D) ~ 1.40\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.36 perfectly matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the candidate answers and highlighting the crucial points.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Relate the Observed Data to Physical Velocity**\n    The problem is solved using the principles of the Radial Velocity (RV) method. The foundational concept is that the maximum observed shift in a star's spectral line wavelength, $\\Delta\\lambda$, is directly proportional to the star's maximum velocity towards or away from us (the velocity semi-amplitude, $K$).\n    *   **Relationship:** $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda$\n    *   **Given Data:** $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstroms and $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstroms.\n    *   **Ratio:** This direct proportionality allows us to set up a ratio of the stars' velocities:\n        $$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{5}{7} $$\n\n2.  **Relate Stellar Velocity to the Planet's Orbital Period**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) is related to the planet's orbital period ($P$), the planet's mass ($m_p$), and the star's mass ($M_{star}$) by a formula derived from Kepler's Laws. Given the conditions in the problem (identical star masses, similar planet masses, and assuming similar orbital inclinations for a solvable problem), this complex formula simplifies to a crucial proportionality:\n    *   **Relationship:** $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$ or $K \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{P}}$\n    This means that a higher stellar velocity ($K$) is caused by a planet with a shorter orbital period ($P$).\n\n3.  **Combine the Ratios to Solve for the Period Ratio**\n    The question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to planet #1, which is $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$. We can use the proportionality from Step 2 to establish a relationship between the two systems:\n    $$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{P_1^{-1/3}}{P_2^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n    To isolate the desired period ratio $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$, we must cube both sides of the equation:\n    $$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3 $$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Numerical Value**\n    Substitute the known velocity ratio (which is equal to the wavelength shift ratio from Step 1) into the final equation:\n    $$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{5^3}{7^3} = \\frac{125}{343} $$\n    Calculating the decimal value gives:\n    $$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\approx 0.3644 $$\n    This value rounds to **~0.36**.\n\n### Careful Points & Sanity Check\n\n*   **Proportionality Power:** A critical step is using the correct relationship $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$. It's important not to miss the inverse nature or the cube root.\n*   **Correct Final Operation:** The derivation shows that the period ratio is the cube of the velocity ratio, i.e., $(\\frac{5}{7})^3$. It is not the cube root or the simple ratio itself.\n*   **Ratio Direction:** The question asks for $P_2 / P_1$. It is important to keep the indices consistent throughout the derivation to avoid accidentally calculating the inverse, $P_1 / P_2$.\n*   **Physical Sanity Check:** Planet #2 causes a larger wavelength shift (7 > 5), so its host star is moving faster ($K_2 > K_1$). For similar mass planets, a faster-moving star means the planet must have a stronger gravitational tug, implying a closer orbit. By Kepler's Third Law, a closer orbit has a shorter period. Therefore, we expect $P_2 < P_1$, meaning the ratio $P_2/P_1$ must be less than 1. Our calculated value of ~0.36 satisfies this condition.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe analysis shows with high confidence that the orbital period of planet #2 is ~0.36 times that of planet #1.

The variations in the final lettered choice among the agents are due to the multiple-choice options being presented in a different order, not due to any disagreement in the physics or the result.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, highlighting the key points.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Relate Observation (Wavelength Shift) to Physical Quantity (Velocity):** The problem utilizes the Radial Velocity (RV) method. The core principle is that the measured maximum shift in a star's spectral line wavelength, $\\Delta\\lambda$, is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, $K$.\n    *   **Relationship:** $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda$.\n    *   **Given Data:** $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ mÅ and $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ mÅ.\n    *   **Ratio:** This allows us to establish the ratio of the stellar velocities:\n        $$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{5}{7} $$\n\n2.  **Relate Stellar Velocity (K) to Orbital Period (P):** The formula for the stellar velocity semi-amplitude, $K$, is related to the planet's orbital period, $P$, and other system parameters. For a planet in a circular orbit:\n    $$ K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_{\\text{star}}^{2/3}} $$\n    The problem states that star masses ($M_{star}$) are the same and planet masses ($m_p$) are similar. To arrive at a single answer, it's a standard assumption in such problems that the measured term, $m_p \\sin(i)$, is also the same for both systems. With these terms being constant, the formula simplifies to a crucial proportionality:\n    *   **Simplified Relationship:** $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$.\n\n3.  **Derive the Final Formula and Calculate:** The question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to planet #1 ($P_2/P_1$). Using the proportionality from the previous step:\n    $$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{P_1^{-1/3}}{P_2^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n    To solve for the period ratio $P_2/P_1$, we must cube both sides of the equation:\n    $$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3 $$\n    Substituting the known velocity ratio gives the final calculation:\n    $$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{125}{343} \\approx 0.3644 $$\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **The Power Law:** The relationship is $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$. It is essential to use the power of -1/3 correctly, which means that solving for P leads to cubing the K ratio ($P \\propto K^{-3}$).\n*   **The Ratios:** One must be careful to keep track of the subscripts (1 and 2). Since we are solving for $P_2/P_1$, the final expression is correctly $(K_1/K_2)^3$.\n*   **Physical Sanity Check:** Planet #2 causes a larger wavelength shift (7 > 5), so its star moves faster ($K_2 > K_1$). For similar mass planets, a faster stellar wobble is caused by a planet in a closer orbit. According to Kepler's Third Law, a closer orbit means a shorter period. Therefore, we should expect $P_2$ to be shorter than $P_1$, which means the ratio $P_2/P_1$ must be less than 1. Our result of ~0.36 confirms this, while options like 1.40 or 1.96 would be physically incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1 is **~0.36**.

The core principle is that the measured maximum wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity along our line of sight (K).\n    *   This gives the proportionality: `K ∝ Δλ`.\n    *   From the given data (`Δλ₁ = 5` mÅ, `Δλ₂ = 7` mÅ), we can establish the ratio of the velocities:\n        `K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 / 7`.\n\n2.  **Relate Stellar Velocity (K) to the Planet's Orbital Period (P)**: For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula `K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3))`.\n    *   The problem simplifies this by stating that the star masses (`M_star`) are the same and the planet masses (`m_p`) are similar.\n    *   For the problem to be solvable with the given information, we must assume that the term `sin(i)` (where `i` is the orbital inclination) is also comparable for both systems.\n    *   With these factors being constant, the formula simplifies to the crucial proportionality:\n        `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`.\n    *   This means a higher stellar velocity is caused by a planet with a shorter orbital period.\n\n3.  **Combine Ratios and Solve for the Period Ratio (P₂ / P₁)**: We want to find the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1.\n    *   From the proportionality `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`, we can write:\n        `K₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3) = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`.\n    *   To solve for `P₂ / P₁`, we cube both sides of the equation:\n        `P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)^3`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Value**: We substitute the velocity ratio from Step 1 into our final equation:\n    *   `P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³ = 125 / 343`.\n    *   The numerical calculation gives: `P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644`.\n\n### Careful Points and Sanity Check\n\n*   **Sanity Check**: Star #2 causes a larger wavelength shift (7 vs. 5), so it must be moving faster (`K₂ > K₁`). For planets of the same mass, this implies planet #2 is in a closer orbit. According to Kepler's Third Law, a closer orbit has a shorter period.

All candidates who showed their work correctly identified the underlying physics and performed the same calculation, with variations in the final letter choice stemming only from the random ordering of options they were presented.\n\nHere is a definitive step-by-step analysis to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Relate Wavelength Shift to Stellar Velocity**\n\nThe Radial Velocity (RV) method is based on the Doppler effect. The maximum observed wavelength shift of a star's spectral line ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity along the line of sight ($K$).\n\n*   This relationship is: $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda$.\n*   Therefore, the ratio of the stellar velocities can be found from the ratio of the wavelength shifts:\n    $$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{5}{7} $$\n\n**Step 2: Relate Stellar Velocity to the Planet's Orbital Period**\n\nThe formula for the stellar velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n\n$$ K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_{\\text{star}}^{2/3}} $$\n\nThe problem states that the star masses ($M_{star}$) are the same, and the planet masses ($m_p$) are similar. For a solvable problem with a unique answer, it's a standard assumption that the unobserved orbital inclination ($i$) is also similar for both systems. With these terms being constant, the formula simplifies to a crucial proportionality between the star's velocity and the planet's orbital period ($P$):\n\n$$ K \\propto P^{-1/3} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad K \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{P}} $$\n\n**Step 3: Combine Ratios and Solve for the Period Ratio**\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to planet #1, which is $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$. Using the proportionality from Step 2:\n\n$$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{P_1^{-1/3}}{P_2^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n\nTo solve for the period ratio ($\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$), we cube both sides of the equation:\n\n$$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3 $$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Final Value**\n\nSubstitute the known ratio of velocities from Step 1 into the equation from Step 3:\n\n$$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{5^3}{7^3} = \\frac{125}{343} \\approx 0.3644 $$\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Correct Proportionality:** It is essential to recognize that `K` is inversely proportional to the cube root of `P`, not directly proportional or related by a different power. A larger velocity means a shorter period.\n2.  **Handling the Ratios:** Ensure the indices (1 and 2) are tracked correctly. The final formula for `P₂/P₁` depends on `(K₁/K₂)^3`. Accidentally flipping the ratio to `(K₂/K₁)^3` would yield the inverse answer (~2.74), which is incorrect.\n3.  **The Hidden Assumption:** The problem is solvable because key parameters (star mass, planet mass) are the same or similar, leading to the assumption that the quantity `m_p sin(i) / M_star^(2/3)` is constant for both systems.\n4.  **Sanity Check:** Star #2 produces a larger wavelength shift (7 vs. 5), so `K₂ > K₁`. This implies a stronger gravitational tug from a planet in a closer orbit. A closer orbit, by Kepler's Third Law, means a shorter orbital period. Therefore, we expect `P₂` to be shorter than `P₁`, so the ratio `P₂/P₁` must be less than 1. Our calculated result of ~0.36 is consistent with this check.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculation consistently yields a value of approximately **0.36**.

The task is to synthesize the correct reasoning, perform the calculation, and match the result to the specific option list provided in the question prompt.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Relate Observation (Wavelength Shift) to Physical Quantity (Stellar Velocity)**\n    The foundation of the Radial Velocity (RV) method is the Doppler effect. The maximum observed shift in a star's spectral line wavelength, $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$, is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, $K$.\n    *   Relationship: $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max}$\n    *   Given Data: $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstroms; $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstroms.\n    *   Conclusion: The ratio of the stellar velocities is the same as the ratio of the wavelength shifts: $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{5}{7}$.\n\n2.  **Relate Stellar Velocity (K) to the Planet's Orbital Period (P)**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the formula for the star's velocity semi-amplitude is:\n    $$ K = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{P} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_{\\text{star}}^{2/3}} $$\n    The problem provides crucial simplifying conditions: the stars have identical masses ($M_{star1} = M_{star2}$) and the planets have similar masses ($m_{p1} \\approx m_{p2}$). For the problem to be uniquely solvable, we make the standard assumption that the orbital inclinations ($i$) are also similar, making the `(m_p sin(i))` term effectively constant.\n    *   Relationship: With other terms constant, the formula simplifies to the proportionality $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$. This means that a star moving at a higher velocity is orbited by a planet with a shorter period.\n\n3.  **Combine Ratios to Solve for the Period Ratio**\n    The question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1 ($\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$). We use the proportionality from the previous step:\n    $$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{P_1^{-1/3}}{P_2^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n    To isolate the desired period ratio, we must cube both sides of the equation:\n    $$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3 $$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Value**\n    Substitute the known ratio of velocities into the final equation:\n    $$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{5^3}{7^3} = \\frac{125}{343} \\approx 0.3644 $$\n\n### Careful Points and Final Decision\n\n*   **Sanity Check:** Planet #2 causes a larger wavelength shift (7 mÅ > 5 mÅ), meaning its host star moves faster ($K_2 > K_1$). For planets of the same mass, a faster stellar wobble is caused by a planet in a closer orbit. According to Kepler's Third Law, a closer orbit has a shorter period. Therefore, we expect $P_2$ to be shorter than $P_1$, and the ratio $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$ must be less than 1. Our result of ~0.36 is consistent with this physical reasoning.\n*   **Avoiding Errors:** A common error is to invert the ratio. If we had calculated $(\\frac{7}{5})^3$, the answer would be ~1.96, which matches option B but is physically incorrect. The careful setup of the ratios is crucial.\n*   **Final Match:** The numerical calculation yields ~0.36. We must match this result to the specific list of options presented in the question:\n    A) ~ 0.85\n    B) ~ 1.96\n    C) ~ 1.40\n    D) ~ 0.36\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.36 matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nAn analysis of the provided candidate answers reveals a strong and correct consensus on the physical principles and mathematical steps required to solve the problem. The discrepancies in the final lettered choices are solely due to the agents being presented with shuffled multiple-choice options, not any error in their reasoning.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the universally agreed-upon solution path.\n\n**Step 1: Relate Observational Data to Stellar Velocity**\n\nThe problem uses the Radial Velocity (RV) method. The core principle is that the maximum shift in a star's spectral line wavelength ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's maximum line-of-sight velocity, known as the velocity semi-amplitude ($K$).\n\n*   **Principle:** $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda$\n*   **Data:**\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstroms\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstroms\n*   **Ratio:** This direct proportionality means the ratio of the velocities is the same as the ratio of the wavelength shifts:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\n**Step 2: Relate Stellar Velocity to the Planet's Orbital Period**\n\nThe formula for the stellar velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) induced by a planet in a circular orbit is $K = (\\frac{2\\pi G}{P})^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{M_{\\text{star}}^{2/3}}$.\n\nThe problem states that star masses ($M_{star}$) are the same, and planet masses ($m_p$) are similar. For the problem to have a unique solution, it is a standard and necessary assumption that the unseen orbital inclination factor ($\\sin(i)$) is also similar, meaning the entire term $m_p \\sin(i) / M_{\\text{star}}^{2/3}$ is a constant for both systems.\n\n*   **Principle:** With the other terms constant, the relationship simplifies to an inverse proportionality between the star's velocity and the cube root of the planet's period:\n    $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\n**Step 3: Combine Ratios and Solve for the Period Ratio**\n\nThe goal is to find the ratio of the period of planet #2 to planet #1 ($\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$).\n\n*   **Derivation:** We can use the proportionality from Step 2 to set up an equation:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{P_1^{-1/3}}{P_2^{-1/3}} = (\\frac{P_1}{P_2})^{-1/3} = (\\frac{P_2}{P_1})^{1/3}$\n*   **Solving for the target ratio:** We can equate our known velocity ratio with the period ratio expression and solve for $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$ by cubing both sides:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = (\\frac{K_1}{K_2})^3$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Final Numerical Value**\n\nSubstitute the value of the velocity ratio from Step 1 into the final equation.\n\n*   **Calculation:**\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = (\\frac{5}{7})^3 = \\frac{5 \\times 5 \\times 5}{7 \\times 7 \\times 7} = \\frac{125}{343} \\approx 0.3644$\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Correct Proportionality:** It is crucial to use the correct relationship $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$. A mistake here (e.g., using a direct proportion or a different exponent) would lead to an incorrect answer.\n2.  **Correct Ratio Setup:** The question asks for the period of #2 relative to #1 ($P_2/P_1$). Care must be taken to keep the indices consistent throughout the derivation.\n3.  **Sanity Check:** Star #2 induces a larger wavelength shift ($7 > 5$), which means star #2 moves faster ($K_2 > K_1$). For identical star and planet masses, a faster \"wobble\" is caused by a planet in a closer orbit. According to Kepler's Third Law, a closer orbit has a shorter period. Therefore, we must have $P_2 < P_1$, which means the ratio $P_2/P_1$ must be less than 1. Our calculated result of ~0.36 is consistent with this physical intuition.\n4.  **Final Option Matching:** The calculation yields a numerical value of ~0.36.
