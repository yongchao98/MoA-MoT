Here is a step-by-step breakdown to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Principle:** The decay of a single atomic nucleus is a random process that follows an exponential distribution. The most important characteristic of this process is that it is **memoryless**. This means the probability of the atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already survived.\n\n2.  **Simplify the Question:** Because the process is memoryless, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future decay probability. The question can be simplified to: \"What is the probability that a newly formed atom of this type will decay within 150 minutes?\"\n\n3.  **Set up the Mathematical Model:**\n    *   The probability that an atom *survives* (does not decay) for a time `t` is given by the survival function: `S(t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant.\n    *   The probability that an atom *decays* within a time `t` is: `P(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n4.  **Use the Given Information:** We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (0.32).\n    *   `P(100) = 1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32`\n    *   From this, we can determine the probability of survival for 100 minutes:\n        `S(100) = e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Required Probability:** We need to find the probability of decay within a 150-minute interval, `P(150)`.\n    *   `P(150) = 1 - S(150) = 1 - e^(-150λ)`\n    *   We can express `e^(-150λ)` in terms of the value we found in the previous step by using the properties of exponents:\n        `e^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`\n    *   Now, substitute the known value `e^(-100λ) = 0.68`:\n        `e^(-150λ) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n6.  **Perform the Final Calculation:**\n    *   `S(150) = (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607`\n    *   The probability of decay is `P(150) = 1 - S(150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The calculated probability is 0.4393, or 43.93%.

The information that the atom has survived for 50 minutes is extraneous and designed to test the understanding of this property. Any calculation that tries to use the 50-minute survival time in a complex conditional probability is unnecessarily complicated and likely incorrect.\n*   **Decay vs. Survival:** It is crucial to distinguish between the probability of decay, `P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`, and the probability of survival, `S(t) = e^(-λt)`. The initial information (32% decay) must be converted to survival probability (68%) to correctly use the `e^(-λt)` formula.\n*   **Exponent Manipulation:** The most efficient solution avoids explicitly calculating the decay constant `λ`. By using the relationship `e^(-150λ) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`, the calculation is simplified and potential rounding errors from finding `λ` are avoided.\n*   **Final Answer Selection:** All candidate answers that performed the calculation correctly arrived at ~44%.

This is a random quantum process governed by an exponential distribution. The most critical feature of this process is that it is **memoryless**. This means the probability of the atom decaying in a future time interval is completely independent of how long it has already survived. The 50 minutes that have passed without decay are therefore irrelevant to the future probability. The question is equivalent to: \"What is the probability that a new atom of this type will decay within 150 minutes?\"\n\n2.  **Formulate the Mathematical Model**:\n    *   The probability that an atom *survives* (does not decay) for a time `t` is given by the survival function: `S(t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant for the atom.\n    *   The probability that an atom *decays* within a time `t` is: `P(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n3.  **Use the Given Information to Characterize the Atom**:\n    *   We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (0.32).\n    *   `P(100) = 1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`.\n    *   From this, we can determine the probability of survival for 100 minutes: `S(100) = e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Required Probability**:\n    *   We need to find the probability of decay in a 150-minute interval, which is `P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`.\n    *   We can relate the survival probability for 150 minutes, `S(150)`, to the known survival probability for 100 minutes, `S(100)`, by manipulating the exponents:\n        `S(150) = e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`.\n    *   Substituting the value from Step 3: `S(150) = (0.68)^1.5`.\n\n5.  **Compute the Final Numerical Answer**:\n    *   First, calculate the survival probability for 150 minutes: `S(150) = (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607`.\n    *   The probability of decay is 1 minus the survival probability: `P(150) = 1 - S(150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`.\n    *   Converting this to a percentage gives 43.93%.\n\n6.  **Compare with Options**: The calculated probability of 43.93% is closest to the given option of 44%.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **The Memoryless Property**: This is the most crucial concept. The 50 minutes of survival time is extraneous information intended to test the understanding of this principle. Any attempt to use this information in a conditional probability calculation is unnecessarily complex and misses the fundamental nature of exponential decay.\n*   **Decay vs. Survival Probability**: It is important to distinguish between the probability of decay `P(t)` and the probability of survival `S(t)`. The exponential term `e^(-λt)` directly represents survival.\n*   **Exponent Manipulation**: The most direct solution avoids calculating the decay constant `λ` explicitly. By recognizing that `S(150) = S(100)^1.5`, the calculation is simplified and potential rounding errors from finding and reusing `λ` are avoided.\n*   **Final Selection**: The overwhelming consensus in the reasoning of the candidate answers leads to a numerical result of ~43.93%. The final step is to correctly match this result to the closest option, which is 44%.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nOf course, I can help with that. Here is my analysis of the problem and the Python code to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Principle:** The problem describes radioactive decay. The most important physical principle for this type of problem is that radioactive decay is a **memoryless process**. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already survived. The atom does not \"age.\" Therefore, the fact that 50 minutes have already passed is irrelevant to the calculation. The question simplifies to: \"What is the probability that a new atom of this type will decay within 150 minutes?\"\n\n2.  **Set up the Mathematical Model:** The probability of an atom *surviving* (not decaying) for a time `t` is given by the exponential decay formula:\n    `P_survival(t) = e^(-λt)`\n    where `λ` is the decay constant.\n    The probability of the atom *decaying* within a time `t` is therefore:\n    `P_decay(t) = 1 - P_survival(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\n\n3.  **Use the Given Information:** We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (0.32). We can use this to find a key value for our calculation.\n    `P_decay(100) = 1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`\n    From this, we can determine the probability of survival for 100 minutes:\n    `P_survival(100) = e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Required Probability:** We need to find the probability of decay within a 150-minute interval, `P_decay(150)`.\n    `P_decay(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`\n    We can use the properties of exponents to relate this to the value we found in the previous step. Notice that `150 = 100 * 1.5`.\n    `e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n    Now, we substitute the value from Step 3:\n    `e^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:** The final probability of decay is `1 - (0.68)^1.5`. The following Python code will compute this value and compare it to the given options to find the best match.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **The Memoryless Property:** This is the most crucial point. Ignoring it and trying to use complex conditional probability would be incorrect. The 50 minutes is extraneous information.\n*   **Decay vs. Survival:** Be careful to distinguish between the probability of decay (`1 - e^(-λt)`) and the probability of survival (`e^(-λt)`).\n*   **Exponent Rules:** Using exponent rules (`(x^a)^b = x^(a*b)`) simplifies the calculation and avoids having to explicitly solve for the decay constant `λ`, which prevents intermediate rounding errors.\n*   **Mapping to Options:** After calculating the numerical answer, it is essential to carefully match it to the correct lettered option provided in the question.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the known survival probability.\n# The probability of decay in 100 minutes is 0.32.\n# Therefore, the probability of survival for 100 minutes is 1 - 0.32.\nprob_survive_100 = 0.68\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the survival probability for 150 minutes.\n# Due to the memoryless property, the 50 minutes that passed are irrelevant.\n# We need to find the probability of decay in a 150-minute interval.\n# P_survive(150) = e^(-λ*150) = (e^(-λ*100))^1.5 = (prob_survive_100)^1.5\nprob_survive_150 = prob_survive_100 ** 1.5\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the decay probability for 150 minutes.\n# This is 1 minus the survival probability.\nprob_decay_150 = 1 - prob_survive_150\n\n# Convert the result to a percentage for comparison.\nprob_decay_150_percent = prob_decay_150 * 100\n\nprint(f\"The calculated probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is: {prob_decay_150_percent:.2f}%\")\n\n# Step 4: Compare the result with the given options to find the closest one.\noptions = {'A': 48, 'B': 44, 'C': 40, 'D': 52}\nclosest_option = min(options, key=lambda k: abs(options[k] - prob_decay_150_percent))\n\nprint(\"\\nHere are the options:\")\nprint(\"A) 48%\")\nprint(\"B) 44%\")\nprint(\"C) 40%\")\nprint(\"D) 52%\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated value is closest to {options[closest_option]}%, which is option {closest_option}.\")\n\n```\n<<<B>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The calculated probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is: 43.93%\n\nHere are the options:\nA) 48%\nB) 44%\nC) 40%\nD) 52%\n\nThe calculated value is closest to 44%, which is option B.\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physical Principle:** The problem describes the decay of a single atomic nucleus.

The probability of decay per unit of time is constant for a given type of nucleus. This leads to an exponential decay law and, most importantly, the **memoryless property**.\n\n2.  **Apply the Memoryless Property**: This property signifies that the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of its past history. In this problem, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future decay probability. The atom does not \"age\" or become \"overdue\" for decay. Therefore, the question can be simplified to: \"What is the probability that a new atom of this type will decay within a 150-minute interval?\"\n\n3.  **Set up the Mathematical Framework**:\n    *   The probability that an atom survives (does not decay) for a time `t` is given by the survival function: `S(t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant.\n    *   The probability that an atom decays within a time `t` is `P(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n4.  **Use the Given Data to Characterize the Atom**:\n    *   We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, so `P(100) = 0.32`.\n    *   This allows us to find the probability of survival for 100 minutes: `S(100) = 1 - P(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`.\n    *   From the survival function, we now have a key value: `e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Required Probability**:\n    *   We need to find the probability of decay within 150 minutes, which is `P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`.\n    *   We can use the properties of exponents to find `e^(-λ * 150)` from our known value:\n        `e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n    *   Substituting the value from the previous step:\n        `e^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n6.  **Perform the Final Calculation**:\n    *   First, calculate the survival probability for 150 minutes: `S(150) = (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607`.\n    *   Then, calculate the decay probability for 150 minutes: `P(150) = 1 - S(150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`.\n\n7.  **Conclusion**:\n    *   The calculated probability of decay is `0.4393`, or `43.93%`.\n    *   Comparing this result to the given options:\n        *   A) 48%\n        *   B) 52%\n        *   C) 40%\n        *   D) 44%\n    *   The value `43.93%` is closest to `44%`.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **The Memoryless Property**: This is the most critical point. The 50 minutes of prior survival time is extraneous information designed to test the understanding of this concept.\n*   **Decay vs. Survival**: It is essential to correctly move between the probability of decay `P(t)` and the probability of survival `S(t)`. The exponential formula `e^(-λt)` directly represents survival.\n*   **Time Interval**: The question asks for the probability of decay in the *next* 150 minutes. Due to the memoryless property, this is identical to the probability of decay in the *first* 150 minutes for a new atom.\n*   **Exponent Manipulation**: The calculation relies on the identity `x^(a*b) = (x^a)^b`. This allows for a direct solution without needing to calculate the decay constant `λ` explicitly, which simplifies the calculation and avoids rounding errors.\n\nAll candidate answers correctly identified the memoryless property and the calculation method.

This is the complement of survival: `P(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n4.  **Use the Given Information:** We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (0.32).\n    *   `P(100) = 0.32`\n    *   This means the probability of survival for 100 minutes is `S(100) = 1 - P(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`.\n    *   From the formula in step 3, we have the key relationship: `e^(-100λ) = 0.68`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Required Probability:** We need to find the probability of decay within 150 minutes, `P(150)`.\n    *   `P(150) = 1 - S(150) = 1 - e^(-150λ)`\n    *   We can find the value of `e^(-150λ)` by using the relationship from step 4 and the properties of exponents:\n        `e^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`\n    *   Substituting the value we found: `e^(-150λ) = (0.68)^1.5`.\n\n6.  **Perform the Final Calculation:**\n    *   The probability of decay is `P(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`.\n    *   Let's calculate this value.\n    ```python\n    # The probability of survival for 100 minutes is 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.\n    # The probability of survival for 150 minutes is (0.68)^1.5.\n    prob_survival_150 = 0.68 ** 1.5\n    \n    # The probability of decay in 150 minutes is 1 minus the probability of survival.\n    prob_decay_150 = 1 - prob_survival_150\n    \n    # Print the result as a percentage.\n    print(f\"The calculated probability is {prob_decay_150 * 100:.2f}%\")\n    ```\n    The calculated probability is 43.93%\n\n7.  **Select the Correct Option:** The calculated probability is 43.93%.

The information that 50 minutes have passed is extraneous and designed to test the understanding of this principle. The atom's \"clock\" effectively resets at every moment.\n*   **Decay vs. Survival:** It is essential to correctly distinguish between the probability of decay (`P(t)`) and the probability of survival (`S(t)`). The exponential term `e^(-λt)` represents survival. The given 32% is a decay probability, which must be converted to a survival probability (`1 - 0.32 = 0.68`) to be used in the formula.\n*   **Exponent Manipulation:** The calculation is most elegantly solved by manipulating exponents (`e^(-150λ) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`). This avoids the intermediate step of explicitly calculating the decay constant `λ`, which would introduce unnecessary calculations and potential rounding errors.\n*   **Correct Mapping:** After arriving at the correct numerical answer (~44%), it is crucial to map it to the correct lettered option from the provided list.\n\nAll the provided candidate answers correctly identified the memoryless property and followed the same valid calculation steps, arriving at ~43.93%.
