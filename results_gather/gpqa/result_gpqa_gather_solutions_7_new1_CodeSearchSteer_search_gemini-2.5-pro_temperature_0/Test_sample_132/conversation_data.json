I will first outline the plan and then provide the Python code to execute the calculations and determine the correct answer.\n\n### Plan and Careful Points\n\n1.  **Identify the Buffer System**: The solution contains KH₂PO₄ (which provides the weak acid H₂PO₄⁻) and Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O (which provides its conjugate base HPO₄²⁻). These two species form a buffer.\n2.  **Calculate Molar Concentrations**:\n    *   First, calculate the moles of each substance by dividing its mass by its molar mass. A key point is to use the molar mass of the hydrated salt, Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O (177.99 g/mol), not the anhydrous form.\n    *   Then, calculate the initial molar concentration of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻ by dividing their moles by the solution volume. Remember to convert the volume from cm³ to Liters (200.00 cm³ = 0.20000 L).\n3.  **Calculate Hydrogen Ion Concentration ([H⁺])**:\n    *   The [H⁺] of the buffer is determined by the equilibrium between the acid and its conjugate base: H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻.\n    *   This equilibrium is governed by the second acid dissociation constant, Ka₂. We will use the formula: `[H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])`.\n4.  **Calculate Orthophosphate Ion Concentration ([PO₄³⁻])**:\n    *   The orthophosphate ion is formed in the next dissociation step: HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻.\n    *   This equilibrium is governed by the third acid dissociation constant, Ka₃. We will use the formula: `[PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])`.\n    *   We use the [H⁺] calculated in the previous step and the initial concentration of [HPO₄²⁻]. This is a valid assumption because Ka₃ is extremely small, meaning the amount of HPO₄²⁻ that dissociates is negligible.\n5.  **Compare and Conclude**: The final calculated value for [PO₄³⁻] will be compared against the given options to select the correct answer.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the given values and constants\nmass_kh2po4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_kh2po4 = 136.09  # g/mol\n\nmass_na2hpo4_2h2o = 1.00  # g\nmw_na2hpo4_2h2o = 177.99  # g/mol\n\nvolume_L = 200.00 / 1000.0  # L\n\n# Acid dissociation constants for phosphoric acid\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the initial molar concentrations of the buffer components\n# Moles of H2PO4- from KH2PO4\nmoles_h2po4 = mass_kh2po4 / mw_kh2po4\n# Concentration of H2PO4-\nconc_h2po4 = moles_h2po4 / volume_L\n\n# Moles of HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4.2H2O\nmoles_hpo4 = mass_na2hpo4_2h2o / mw_na2hpo4_2h2o\n# Concentration of HPO4^2-\nconc_hpo4 = moles_hpo4 / volume_L\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] using the buffer equilibrium (Ka2)\n# [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-]\nconc_h_plus = Ka2 * (conc_h2po4 / conc_hpo4)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-] using the third dissociation (Ka3)\n# [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]\nconc_po4 = Ka3 * (conc_hpo4 / conc_h_plus)\n\n# Step 5: Print the results and compare with the options\nprint(f\"Calculated concentration of H2PO4- = {conc_h2po4:.4f} M\")\nprint(f\"Calculated concentration of HPO4^2- = {conc_hpo4:.4f} M\")\nprint(f\"Calculated concentration of H+ = {conc_h_plus:.3e} M\")\nprint(f\"Final calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) = {conc_po4:.3e} M\")\nprint(\"\\n--- Options ---\")\nprint(f\"A) 5.48x10^-7 M\")\nprint(f\"B) 6.24x10^-7 M\")\nprint(f\"C) 3.97x10^-7 M\")\nprint(f\"D) 2.81x10^-7 M\")\n\n# Determine the closest option\noptions = {'A': 5.48e-7, 'B': 6.24e-7, 'C': 3.97e-7, 'D': 2.81e-7}\nclosest_option = min(options, key=lambda k: abs(options[k] - conc_po4))\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated value {conc_po4:.3e} M is closest to option {closest_option}.\")\n\n<<<B>>>\n```\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: \nErrors:   File \"<stdin>\", line 50\n    <<<B>>>\n    ^^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1.

A key point is to use the molar mass of the hydrated salt, Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O (177.99 g/mol), not the anhydrous form.\n    *   Then, calculate the initial molar concentration of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻ by dividing their moles by the solution volume. Remember to convert the volume from cm³ to Liters (200.00 cm³ = 0.20000 L).\n3.  **Calculate Hydrogen Ion Concentration ([H⁺])**:\n    *   The [H⁺] of the buffer is determined by the equilibrium between the acid and its conjugate base: H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻.\n    *   This equilibrium is governed by the second acid dissociation constant, Ka₂. We will use the formula: `[H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])`.\n4.  **Calculate Orthophosphate Ion Concentration ([PO₄³⁻])**:\n    *   The orthophosphate ion is formed in the next dissociation step: HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻.\n    *   This equilibrium is governed by the third acid dissociation constant, Ka₃. We will use the formula: `[PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])`.\n    *   We use the [H⁺] calculated in the previous step and the initial concentration of [HPO₄²⁻]. This is a valid assumption because Ka₃ is extremely small, meaning the amount of HPO₄²⁻ that dissociates is negligible.\n5.  **Compare and Conclude**: The final calculated value for [PO₄³⁻] will be compared against the given options to select the correct answer.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the given values and constants\nmass_kh2po4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_kh2po4 = 136.09  # g/mol\n\nmass_na2hpo4_2h2o = 1.00  # g\nmw_na2hpo4_2h2o = 177.99  # g/mol\n\nvolume_L = 200.00 / 1000.0  # L\n\n# Acid dissociation constants for phosphoric acid\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the initial molar concentrations of the buffer components\n# Moles of H2PO4- from KH2PO4\nmoles_h2po4 = mass_kh2po4 / mw_kh2po4\n# Concentration of H2PO4-\nconc_h2po4 = moles_h2po4 / volume_L\n\n# Moles of HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4.2H2O\nmoles_hpo4 = mass_na2hpo4_2h2o / mw_na2hpo4_2h2o\n# Concentration of HPO4^2-\nconc_hpo4 = moles_hpo4 / volume_L\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] using the buffer equilibrium (Ka2)\n# [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-]\nconc_h_plus = Ka2 * (conc_h2po4 / conc_hpo4)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-] using the third dissociation (Ka3)\n# [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]\nconc_po4 = Ka3 * (conc_hpo4 / conc_h_plus)\n\n# Step 5: Print the results and compare with the options\nprint(f\"Calculated concentration of H2PO4- = {conc_h2po4:.4f} M\")\nprint(f\"Calculated concentration of HPO4^2- = {conc_hpo4:.4f} M\")\nprint(f\"Calculated concentration of H+ = {conc_h_plus:.3e} M\")\nprint(f\"Final calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) = {conc_po4:.3e} M\")\nprint(\"\\n--- Options ---\")\nprint(f\"A) 5.48x10^-7 M\")\nprint(f\"B) 6.24x10^-7 M\")\nprint(f\"C) 3.97x10^-7 M\")\nprint(f\"D) 2.81x10^-7 M\")\n\n# Determine the closest option\noptions = {'A': 5.48e-7, 'B': 6.24e-7, 'C': 3.97e-7, 'D': 2.81e-7}\nclosest_option = min(options, key=lambda k: abs(options[k] - conc_po4))\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated value {conc_po4:.3e} M is closest to option {closest_option}.\")\n\n<<<B>>>\n```\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: \nErrors:   File \"<stdin>\", line 50\n    <<<B>>>\n    ^^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1.

The [H⁺] must be determined from the main buffer components first.\n\nThe analysis of the candidate answers shows that while most agents performed the calculation correctly, there was confusion in matching the result to the correct letter option. The calculation consistently yields ~6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nAn analysis of the provided answers and an independent calculation confirm the correct methodology and result.

The equilibrium expression is:\n    Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n    We can rearrange this equation to solve for [H⁺], using the initial concentrations as a valid approximation for the equilibrium concentrations in a buffer:\n    [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n    [H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n    [H⁺] ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n4.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO₄³⁻].**\n    The orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is formed in the third dissociation step of phosphoric acid:\n    HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n    The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹². The equilibrium expression is:\n    Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    We rearrange this to solve for [PO₄³⁻], using the [H⁺] we just calculated and the initial concentration of [HPO₄²⁻] (since its dissociation is negligible due to the very small Ka₃ value):\n    [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n    [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n    [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n**Careful Points**\n\n*   **Molar Mass:** It is essential to use the molar mass of the hydrated salt, Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O (177.99 g/mol), as specified in the problem.\n*   **Volume Conversion:** The volume must be correctly converted from cm³ to Liters (200.00 cm³ = 0.20000 L) to calculate molarity.\n*   **Correct Ka Values:** The calculation is a two-step process. Ka₂ must be used first to find the [H⁺] of the H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻ buffer. Then, Ka₃ must be used with that [H⁺] to find the final [PO₄³⁻].\n*   **Significant Figures:** The given data has three significant figures (1.00 g). The result should be rounded accordingly. The calculated value of 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M rounds to 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions is 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
