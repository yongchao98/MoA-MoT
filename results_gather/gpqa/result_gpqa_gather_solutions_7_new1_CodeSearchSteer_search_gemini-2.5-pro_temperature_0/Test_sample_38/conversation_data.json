This is mathematically expressed as `∫ |ψ(x)|² dx = 1`, where the integral is taken over the defined region. The term `|ψ(x)|²` is the probability density function.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Probability Density `|ψ(x)|²`**: The wave function `ψ(x)` is a complex number.\n    *   `ψ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i`\n    For a complex number `z = Re + i*Im`, the square of its magnitude is `|z|² = (Re)² + (Im)²`.\n    *   Real part: `Re(ψ) = a / sqrt(1 + x)`\n    *   Imaginary part: `Im(ψ) = -0.5`\n    Therefore, the probability density is:\n    *   `|ψ(x)|² = (a / sqrt(1 + x))² + (-0.5)² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25`\n\n3.  **Set Up the Normalization Integral**: The problem states the particle is only found between `x=1` and `x=3`. These are the limits of our integral.\n    *   `∫[from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1`\n\n4.  **Solve the Integral**: We can split the integral for clarity.\n    *   **Part 1**: `∫[from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x)) dx = a² * [ln(1 + x)]` evaluated from 1 to 3.\n        *   `= a² * (ln(1 + 3) - ln(1 + 1)) = a² * (ln(4) - ln(2))`\n        *   Using the logarithm property `ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B)`, this simplifies to `a² * ln(4/2) = a² * ln(2)`.\n    *   **Part 2**: `∫[from 1 to 3] 0.25 dx = [0.25x]` evaluated from 1 to 3.\n        *   `= 0.25 * 3 - 0.25 * 1 = 0.75 - 0.25 = 0.5`.\n\n5.  **Solve for \"a\"**: Substitute the results back into the normalization equation.\n    *   `a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1`\n    *   `a² * ln(2) = 0.5`\n    *   `a² = 0.5 / ln(2)`\n    *   `a = sqrt(0.5 / ln(2))`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Numerical Value**: Using the value `ln(2) ≈ 0.6931`:\n    *   `a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7214`\n    *   `a ≈ sqrt(0.7214) ≈ 0.8493`\n\n7.  **Compare with Options**: The calculated value `a ≈ 0.8493` is closest to option A, which is 0.85.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   The information about the ensemble of 10,000 systems is context to confirm that the experimental findings (particles only between x=1 and x=3) are statistically valid and reflect the true probability distribution. The number 10,000 is not used in the calculation for the single-particle wave function.\n*   The probability density must be calculated as `|ψ|² = ψ*ψ` (the wave function multiplied by its complex conjugate), which for `ψ = Re + i*Im` is `Re² + Im²`. A common mistake would be to simply square the function `ψ`.\n*   The limits of integration are critical and are explicitly given by the problem statement.\n*   The final step of matching the calculated numerical value to the given multiple-choice options must be done carefully.

For a complex function `ψ = Re + i*Im`, this is `Re² + Im²`.\n2.  **Set up the Normalization Integral**: The problem states the particle is only found between x=1 and x=3.

This principle states that the total probability of finding a particle within the entire space where it can exist must be equal to 1. The probability of finding the particle at a specific position `x` is given by the probability density, which is the square of the magnitude of the wave function, `|ψ(x)|²`.\n\n**2. Define the Mathematical Expression for Normalization**\nThe normalization condition is expressed as an integral:\n∫ |ψ(x)|² dx = 1\n\nThe problem specifies that the particles are only found between `x=1` and `x=3`.

Solve for \"a\"**\nWe set the result of the integral equal to 1:\na² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\n\nNow, we solve for \"a\" algebraically:\na² * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5\na² * ln(2) = 0.5\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\na = sqrt( 0.5 / ln(2) )\n\n**6. Calculate the Numerical Value**\nUsing the approximate value for the natural logarithm of 2, ln(2) ≈ 0.6931:\na² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7214\na ≈ sqrt(0.7214) ≈ 0.8493\n\n**7.
