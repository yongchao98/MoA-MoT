A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. A molecule is achiral (and thus optically inactive) if it possesses an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis of each compound:**\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:\n    *   **Structure Type**: This is a substituted biphenyl.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: In biphenyl systems, if the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6') are substituted with sufficiently large groups, free rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings is prevented due to steric hindrance. This phenomenon is known as **atropisomerism**. In this molecule, all four ortho positions are substituted with bulky groups (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃), which restricts rotation. This forces the two phenyl rings into a stable, non-planar (twisted) conformation. This conformation lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, making the molecule chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This compound is chiral and shows optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   **Structure Type**: This is an ester, also known as methyl lactate. Its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: We look for a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. The carbon at position 2 is bonded to:\n        1.  a hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  a hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  a methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since all four attached groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center. A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This compound is chiral and shows optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**:\n    *   **Structure Type**: An aromatic ketone, (C₆H₅)₂C=O.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: The molecule does not have a chiral center. The central carbon is sp² hybridized and bonded to only three groups. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This compound is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**:\n    *   **Structure Type**: The *trans*-isomer of an unsaturated diester, CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: The molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond. It possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and also a center of inversion at the midpoint of the double bond. The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This compound is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nBased on the analysis, compounds 1 and 2 are chiral and exhibit optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and do not. Therefore, the correct option is the one that lists compounds 1 and 2.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nAn analysis of the provided answers and the question requires a step-by-step evaluation of each compound for chirality, which is the necessary condition for a molecule to exhibit optical isomerism. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image, which typically means it lacks elements of symmetry like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis of Each Compound:**\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:\n    *   **Analysis**: This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. The positions adjacent to the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings (the ortho positions) are all occupied by bulky groups (nitro and methoxycarbonyl groups). This steric hindrance prevents free rotation around the C-C single bond, a phenomenon known as atropisomerism. This restricted rotation locks the molecule into a twisted, non-planar conformation that lacks a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The molecule is chiral due to axial chirality (atropisomerism) and therefore exhibits optical isomerism. All candidate answers correctly identified this.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   **Analysis**: This molecule, also known as methyl lactate, has a carbon atom (at position 2) that is bonded to four different chemical groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). A carbon atom bonded to four distinct groups is a chiral center.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral and thus optically active. All candidate answers correctly identified this.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**:\n    *   **Analysis**: The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. The central carbon is double-bonded to an oxygen and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. It is not a chiral center. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond, making the molecule superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Benzophenone is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism. All candidate answers correctly identified this.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**:\n    *   **Analysis**: This is the *trans*-isomer of the dimethyl ester of but-2-enedioic acid. The molecule is planar and possesses both a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral, so it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

While many of the candidate answers reached the correct chemical conclusion, several incorrectly matched their findings to the lettered options. The correct analysis leads unequivocally to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Analyze the condition for optical isomerism**: A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Key features to look for are chiral centers (an atom bonded to four different groups) and axial chirality (like in atropisomers). Conversely, a molecule is achiral if it has a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n2.  **Evaluate Compound 1 (dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate)**: This is a substituted biphenyl. The presence of bulky groups (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃) at all four ortho-positions (2, 2', 6, 6') restricts rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This phenomenon, called atropisomerism, creates a chiral axis, making the molecule non-superimposable on its mirror image. Thus, it is optically active.\n3.  **Evaluate Compound 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate)**: The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The second carbon atom is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, -CH₃, and -COOCH₃. This makes it a chiral center. Molecules with a single chiral center are chiral. Thus, it is optically active.\n4.  **Evaluate Compound 3 (benzophenone)**: The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. The central carbon is not a chiral center as it's bonded to only three groups. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond, making it achiral. Thus, it is not optically active.\n5.  **Evaluate Compound 4 (dimethyl fumarate)**: This is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene ester. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. These symmetry elements make it achiral. Thus, it is not optically active.\n6.  **Synthesize the results**: Compounds 1 and 2 are optically active. Compounds 3 and 4 are not.\n7.  **Select the correct option**: The option that lists compounds 1 and 2 is B.\n\n```python\ndef decide_optical_isomerism():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes four organic compounds for optical isomerism and determines the correct option.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the analysis for each compound based on chirality rules.\n    # A compound is optically active if it is chiral (non-superimposable on its mirror image).\n    # This is typically due to a chiral center or axial chirality (atropisomerism).\n    # A compound is not optically active if it is achiral (has a plane of symmetry or center of inversion).\n\n    analysis = {\n        1: {\n            \"name\": \"dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate\",\n            \"is_chiral\": True,\n            \"reason\": \"Shows atropisomerism due to restricted rotation around the biphenyl bond caused by bulky ortho substituents, leading to axial chirality.\"\n        },\n        2: {\n            \"name\": \"methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\",\n            \"is_chiral\": True,\n            \"reason\": \"Contains a chiral center (C2) bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, -CH3, and -COOCH3.\"\n        },\n        3: {\n            \"name\": \"benzophenone\",\n            \"is_chiral\": False,\n            \"reason\": \"Is achiral because it possesses a plane of symmetry.\"\n        },\n        4: {\n            \"name\": \"dimethyl fumarate\",\n            \"is_chiral\": False,\n            \"reason\": \"Is achiral because it is planar and has a center of inversion.\"\n        }\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis of each compound:\")\n    optically_active_compounds = []\n    for number, details in analysis.items():\n        if details[\"is_chiral\"]:\n            status = \"shows\"\n            optically_active_compounds.append(str(number))\n        else:\n            status = \"does NOT show\"\n        print(f\"Compound {number} ({details['name']}) {status} optical isomerism.

A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicators of chirality are the presence of a chiral center (an atom bonded to four different groups) or an axis of chirality (e.g., in atropisomers). Conversely, a molecule is **achiral** (and thus optically inactive) if it possesses an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n**Analysis of Each Compound:**\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl derivative, where two phenyl rings are connected by a single C-C bond.\n    *   **Chirality Check:** The positions adjacent to the connecting bond (the *ortho* positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are all substituted with large, bulky groups (nitro -NO₂ and methoxycarbonyl -COOCH₃).\n    *   **Reasoning:** The steric hindrance from these bulky groups prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the single bond. This restricted rotation, known as **atropisomerism**, locks the molecule into a stable, non-planar (twisted) conformation.

This phenomenon occurs when bulky substituents at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6') restrict free rotation around the single bond connecting the rings.\n*   **Application:** In this molecule, all four ortho positions are substituted with bulky groups: two nitro groups (-NO₂) and two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH₃). This steric hindrance is significant enough to prevent the rings from being in the same plane (coplanar) and locks the molecule into a twisted, stable conformation.\n*   **Symmetry:** This twisted conformation lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Therefore, the molecule is chiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound exhibits optical isomerism due to axial chirality (atropisomerism).\n\n**2.

Analysis of `dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate`**\n*   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl derivative where the two phenyl rings are connected by a single bond.\n*   **Chirality Check:** The key feature here is the presence of bulky substituents at all four *ortho* positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). The nitro (-NO₂) and methoxycarbonyl (-COOCH₃) groups are large enough to cause significant steric hindrance. This hindrance prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the single bond that connects them.\n*   **Atropisomerism:** This restricted rotation locks the molecule into a twisted, non-planar conformation. Because the substitution on each ring is asymmetric, the molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. This condition, known as atropisomerism, results in a chiral molecule.\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound is chiral and therefore shows optical isomerism.\n\n**2.

A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. A molecule is achiral (and thus optically inactive) if it possesses an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis of each compound:**\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:\n    *   **Structure Type**: This is a substituted biphenyl.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: In biphenyl systems, if the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6') are substituted with sufficiently large groups, free rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings is prevented due to steric hindrance. This phenomenon is known as **atropisomerism**. In this molecule, all four ortho positions are substituted with bulky groups (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃), which restricts rotation. This forces the two phenyl rings into a stable, non-planar (twisted) conformation. This conformation lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, making the molecule chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This compound is chiral and shows optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   **Structure Type**: This is an ester, also known as methyl lactate. Its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: We look for a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. The carbon at position 2 is bonded to:\n        1.  a hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  a hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  a methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since all four attached groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center.

The central carbon is sp² hybridized and bonded to only three groups. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This compound is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**:\n    *   **Structure Type**: The *trans*-isomer of an unsaturated diester, CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: The molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond. It possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and also a center of inversion at the midpoint of the double bond. The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This compound is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nBased on the analysis, compounds 1 and 2 are chiral and exhibit optical isomerism.

The positions adjacent to the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings (the ortho positions) are all occupied by bulky groups (nitro and methoxycarbonyl groups). This steric hindrance prevents free rotation around the C-C single bond, a phenomenon known as atropisomerism. This restricted rotation locks the molecule into a twisted, non-planar conformation that lacks a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The molecule is chiral due to axial chirality (atropisomerism) and therefore exhibits optical isomerism. All candidate answers correctly identified this.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   **Analysis**: This molecule, also known as methyl lactate, has a carbon atom (at position 2) that is bonded to four different chemical groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃).

The correct analysis leads unequivocally to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Analyze the condition for optical isomerism**: A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Key features to look for are chiral centers (an atom bonded to four different groups) and axial chirality (like in atropisomers). Conversely, a molecule is achiral if it has a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n2.  **Evaluate Compound 1 (dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate)**: This is a substituted biphenyl. The presence of bulky groups (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃) at all four ortho-positions (2, 2', 6, 6') restricts rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This phenomenon, called atropisomerism, creates a chiral axis, making the molecule non-superimposable on its mirror image. Thus, it is optically active.\n3.  **Evaluate Compound 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate)**: The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The second carbon atom is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, -CH₃, and -COOCH₃. This makes it a chiral center. Molecules with a single chiral center are chiral. Thus, it is optically active.\n4.  **Evaluate Compound 3 (benzophenone)**: The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. The central carbon is not a chiral center as it's bonded to only three groups. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond, making it achiral. Thus, it is not optically active.\n5.  **Evaluate Compound 4 (dimethyl fumarate)**: This is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene ester. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. These symmetry elements make it achiral. Thus, it is not optically active.\n6.  **Synthesize the results**: Compounds 1 and 2 are optically active. Compounds 3 and 4 are not.\n7.  **Select the correct option**: The option that lists compounds 1 and 2 is B.\n\n```python\ndef decide_optical_isomerism():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes four organic compounds for optical isomerism and determines the correct option.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the analysis for each compound based on chirality rules.\n    # A compound is optically active if it is chiral (non-superimposable on its mirror image).\n    # This is typically due to a chiral center or axial chirality (atropisomerism).\n    # A compound is not optically active if it is achiral (has a plane of symmetry or center of inversion).\n\n    analysis = {\n        1: {\n            \"name\": \"dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate\",\n            \"is_chiral\": True,\n            \"reason\": \"Shows atropisomerism due to restricted rotation around the biphenyl bond caused by bulky ortho substituents, leading to axial chirality.\"\n        },\n        2: {\n            \"name\": \"methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\",\n            \"is_chiral\": True,\n            \"reason\": \"Contains a chiral center (C2) bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, -CH3, and -COOCH3.\"\n        },\n        3: {\n            \"name\": \"benzophenone\",\n            \"is_chiral\": False,\n            \"reason\": \"Is achiral because it possesses a plane of symmetry.\"\n        },\n        4: {\n            \"name\": \"dimethyl fumarate\",\n            \"is_chiral\": False,\n            \"reason\": \"Is achiral because it is planar and has a center of inversion.\"\n        }\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis of each compound:\")\n    optically_active_compounds = []\n    for number, details in analysis.items():\n        if details[\"is_chiral\"]:\n            status = \"shows\"\n            optically_active_compounds.append(str(number))\n        else:\n            status = \"does NOT show\"\n        print(f\"Compound {number} ({details['name']}) {status} optical isomerism.

Analyze the core question:**\nThe question asks to identify which of the four given compounds exhibit optical isomerism. A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This typically occurs when a molecule has a chiral center or an element of axial/planar chirality, and lacks elements of symmetry like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n**2. Evaluate each compound based on the consensus of the candidate answers:**\n\n*   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Analysis:** All candidate answers correctly identify that this molecule is a substituted biphenyl. They all point out that the bulky substituents (-NO2 and -COOCH3) at all four ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6') cause restricted rotation around the central C-C single bond. This phenomenon is known as atropisomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This restricted rotation creates a stable, non-planar, chiral molecule that lacks a plane of symmetry.

The carbon at position 2 is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of this single chiral center makes the molecule chiral and thus optically active. There is a strong consensus on this point.\n\n*   **Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   **Analysis:** All candidate answers correctly identify that this molecule is achiral. It does not have a chiral center, and it possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Due to its symmetry, it is superimposable on its mirror image and does not exhibit optical isomerism. There is a strong consensus on this point.\n\n*   **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Analysis:** All candidate answers correctly identify this molecule as the *trans*-isomer of an alkene. They correctly note that it is a planar molecule and possesses both a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and a center of inversion.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.

Analysis of dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:**\n*   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl derivative, meaning it has two phenyl rings connected by a single C-C bond.\n*   **Chirality:** The key feature is the presence of bulky substituents (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃) at all four *ortho* positions (2, 2', 6, and 6'). This steric hindrance prevents the two rings from rotating freely around the single bond that connects them. This phenomenon is called **atropisomerism**.\n*   **Symmetry:** The restricted rotation locks the molecule into a stable, non-planar (twisted) conformation. This conformation lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, making the molecule chiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is chiral and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**2. Analysis of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n*   **Structure:** Also known as methyl lactate, its chemical formula is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n*   **Chirality:** We need to look for a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.

This analysis will check for common sources of chirality, such as chiral centers and axial chirality, as well as elements of symmetry (like planes or centers of symmetry) that would render a molecule achiral.\n\n**1. Analysis of dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Molecular Structure:** This is a biphenyl derivative, which consists of two phenyl rings connected by a single C-C bond.\n*   **Chirality Check:** The key feature to check in substituted biphenyls is atropisomerism. This phenomenon occurs when bulky substituents at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6') restrict free rotation around the single bond connecting the rings.\n*   **Application:** In this molecule, all four ortho positions are substituted with bulky groups: two nitro groups (-NO₂) and two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH₃). This steric hindrance is significant enough to prevent the rings from being in the same plane (coplanar) and locks the molecule into a twisted, stable conformation.\n*   **Symmetry:** This twisted conformation lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Therefore, the molecule is chiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound exhibits optical isomerism due to axial chirality (atropisomerism).\n\n**2.

A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the carbon at position 2 is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**3. Analysis of benzophenone**\n*   **Molecular Structure:** The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O, where two phenyl rings are attached to a carbonyl carbon.\n*   **Chirality Check:** The molecule does not contain any chiral centers. The central carbon is sp² hybridized and bonded to only three groups. We must check for overall molecular symmetry.\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.

Therefore, the correct option is the one that lists compounds 1 and 2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo determine the final answer, a step-by-step analysis of each compound for chirality is necessary. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image.\n\n**1. Analysis of `dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate`**\n*   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl derivative where the two phenyl rings are connected by a single bond.\n*   **Chirality Check:** The key feature here is the presence of bulky substituents at all four *ortho* positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). The nitro (-NO₂) and methoxycarbonyl (-COOCH₃) groups are large enough to cause significant steric hindrance. This hindrance prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the single bond that connects them.\n*   **Atropisomerism:** This restricted rotation locks the molecule into a twisted, non-planar conformation. Because the substitution on each ring is asymmetric, the molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. This condition, known as atropisomerism, results in a chiral molecule.\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound is chiral and therefore shows optical isomerism.\n\n**2. Analysis of `methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate`**\n*   **Structure:** Also known as methyl lactate, its formula is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n*   **Chirality Check:** We look for a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.

A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n*   **Conclusion:** Since all four groups are different, the carbon at position 2 is a chiral center. The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral, and it thus exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**3. Analysis of `benzophenone`**\n*   **Structure:** Its formula is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. It consists of a carbonyl group attached to two phenyl rings.\n*   **Chirality Check:** The molecule does not have a chiral center. More importantly, it possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\n**4.

A molecule is chiral, and therefore optically active, if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This property typically arises from a lack of certain symmetry elements, most notably a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nHere is a careful, step-by-step analysis of each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. The key to its stereochemistry is the rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. The positions adjacent to this bond (the *ortho* positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are all occupied by bulky substituents (two nitro groups, -NO₂, and two methoxycarbonyl groups, -COOCH₃).\n    *   **Careful Point:** The large size of these groups creates significant steric hindrance, which prevents the two rings from rotating freely and becoming coplanar. This phenomenon is called **atropisomerism**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The restricted rotation locks the molecule into a stable, twisted conformation that lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. This makes the molecule chiral. Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule, also known as methyl lactate, has the structure CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. We must check for chiral centers. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups:\n        1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since this carbon is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral and exists as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers). Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**\n    *   **Analysis:** The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. The central carbon is double-bonded to an oxygen and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. It is not bonded to four different groups and is not a chiral center.\n    *   **Careful Point:** We must check the overall symmetry of the molecule. Benzophenone possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral and thus superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the *trans*-isomer of the dimethyl ester of but-2-enedioic acid. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The molecule is planar. This plane of the molecule is itself a plane of symmetry.
