The eigenstates of these operators form the uncoupled basis, denoted by $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2>$ or simply $|m_1, m_2>$ since $l_1$ and $l_2$ are fixed at 1.\n\n2.  **Identify the desired final state.**\n    We want to find the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ as $-\\hbar$ and the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $m_1\\hbar$. So, $m_1\\hbar = -\\hbar \\implies m_1 = -1$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $m_2\\hbar$. So, $m_2\\hbar = -\\hbar \\implies m_2 = -1$.\n    The final state corresponding to this measurement outcome is the uncoupled basis state $|m_1, m_2> = |-1, -1>$.\n\n3.  **Apply the principles of quantum mechanics to find the probability.**\n    The probability of measuring the system, initially in state $|\\psi>$, to be in a final state $|\\phi_{final}>$ is given by the Born rule:\n    $P = |<\\phi_{final} | \\psi>|^2$.\n\n    In our case, this is:\n    $P(m_1=-1, m_2=-1) = |<-1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>|^2$.\n\n4.  **Use the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.**\n    A fundamental principle in the addition of angular momentum is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components.\n    $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n    This implies that the corresponding quantum numbers also add up:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n\n    The initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$ is an eigenstate of the total z-component operator $L_z$ with eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$. This means the total z-component of angular momentum is precisely defined and has the value $m=-1$.\n\n    The final state we are interested in is $|-1, -1>$. For this state, the sum of the individual z-component quantum numbers is:\n    $m_1 + m_2 = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n\n    A measurement of the individual components $m_1$ and $m_2$ is also an indirect measurement of the total component $m = m_1 + m_2$. Since the initial state has a definite value of $m=-1$, any measurement of the individual components must yield a pair $(m_1, m_2)$ such that their sum is -1.\n\n    Because the desired final state has a total z-component quantum number of $m_{final} = -2$, which is different from the initial state's $m_{initial} = -1$, the transition is forbidden.\n\n5.  **Formal justification using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.**\n    The inner product $<m_1, m_2 | l_1, l_2, l, m>$ is known as a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. A key property of these coefficients is that they are non-zero only if $m_1 + m_2 = m$.\n    In our problem:\n    *   $m_1 = -1$\n    *   $m_2 = -1$\n    *   $m = -1$\n\n    We check the condition: $m_1 + m_2 = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n    Since $m_1 + m_2 \\neq m$ (i.e., $-2 \\neq -1$), the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero:\n    $<-1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1> = 0$.\n\n    Therefore, the probability is:\n    $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\nThe joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$ is 0.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThe problem asks for the joint probability of measuring the z-components of the orbital angular momentum of two electrons, `L_1z` and `L_2z`, to both have the eigenvalue `-ħ`. This corresponds to finding the individual magnetic quantum numbers `m_1` and `m_2` to be -1.\n\nThe state of the two-electron system is given as a coupled angular momentum state: `|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>`.\nHere:\n*   `l_1 = 1` is the orbital angular momentum quantum number of the first electron.\n*   `l_2 = 1` is the orbital angular momentum quantum number of the second electron.\n*   `l = 2` is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the system.\n*   `m = -1` is the magnetic quantum number corresponding to the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum.\n\nA fundamental principle in the addition of angular momentum is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the z-components of the individual angular momenta. In terms of their respective quantum numbers, this relationship is expressed as:\n`m = m_1 + m_2`\n\nThe system is in a state where the total magnetic quantum number `m` is definitively -1. This means that any measurement of the individual magnetic quantum numbers `m_1` and `m_2` must yield values that sum to -1.\n\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific measurement outcome where `m_1 = -1` and `m_2 = -1`. Let's check if this outcome is consistent with the state of the system.\nFor this outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers would be:\n`m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2`\n\nThis result (`-2`) contradicts the known total magnetic quantum number of the system (`m = -1`). Because the state `|m_1=-1, m_2=-1>` is not a possible component of the given state `|l=2, m=-1>`, the two states are orthogonal.\n\nTherefore, the probability of measuring `m_1 = -1` and `m_2 = -1` is zero. The coupled state `|l=2, m=-1>` is a superposition of states where `m_1 + m_2 = -1` (specifically, the states `|m_1=0, m_2=-1>` and `|m_1=-1, m_2=0>`). The state `|m_1=-1, m_2=-1>` is not included in this superposition, so its probability amplitude is zero.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThe problem asks for the joint probability of measuring specific z-components of orbital angular momentum for two electrons in a given coupled state.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the initial and final states:**\n    *   The initial state is the coupled angular momentum state `|l, m> = |2, -1>`. The key quantum number here is the total magnetic quantum number, `m = -1`.\n    *   The desired final state is determined by the measurement outcome. We want the eigenvalue of `L_1z` to be `-ħ` and the eigenvalue of `L_2z` to be `-ħ`. The eigenvalue of `L_z` is `m_q * ħ`, so this corresponds to measuring the individual magnetic quantum numbers `m1 = -1` and `m2 = -1`.\n\n2.  **Apply the conservation principle:**\n    *   In quantum mechanics, the addition of angular momenta follows specific rules. The relationship between the coupled state `|l, m>` and the uncoupled states `|m1, m2>` is described by Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n    *   A fundamental selection rule for these coefficients is that they are non-zero only if the z-components of the angular momentum are conserved. This means the total magnetic quantum number `m` must equal the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   So, we must have `m = m1 + m2` for the probability to be non-zero.\n\n3.  **Calculate and conclude:**\n    *   Check if the condition `m = m1 + m2` is met for this problem.\n    *   Initial state: `m = -1`.\n    *   Final state: `m1 + m2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2`.\n    *   Since `m ≠ m1 + m2` (`-1 ≠ -2`), the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient that connects these states is zero.\n    *   The probability of a measurement is the square of the magnitude of this coefficient. Therefore, the probability is `0^2 = 0`.\n\n4.  **Code Implementation:**\n    *   The Python code will define the quantum numbers `m`, `m1`, and `m2`.\n    *   It will then check if `m` is equal to `m1 + m2`.\n    *   Based on this check, it will determine the probability and select the correct option.\n\n```python\ndef solve_angular_momentum_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the joint probability for measuring the z-components of angular momentum.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the quantum numbers from the problem statement.\n    # The initial coupled state is |l, m> = |2, -1>.\n    # The total magnetic quantum number of the system is m.\n    m = -1\n\n    # The measurement is for the eigenvalues of L_1z and L_2z to both be -ħ.\n    # The eigenvalue of L_z is m_q * ħ, where m_q is the magnetic quantum number.\n    # So, we are measuring for m1 = -1 and m2 = -1.\n    m1_measured = -1\n    m2_measured = -1\n\n    # Step 2: Apply the selection rule for the addition of angular momentum.\n    # The probability is non-zero only if m = m1 + m2.

Understand the System and the Initial State**\n\n*   The system consists of two electrons, each in a p-orbital. For a p-orbital, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=1$. So, for our two electrons, we have $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$.\n*   The problem specifies that we are ignoring spin angular momentum.\n*   The system is in a specific *coupled* angular momentum state, denoted by $|l_1, l_2, l, m>$. The given state is $|1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n    *   $l_1 = 1$: Orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 1.\n    *   $l_2 = 1$: Orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 2.\n    *   $l = 2$: Total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the 2-electron system.\n    *   $m = -1$: The quantum number for the z-component of the *total* orbital angular momentum ($L_z$). The eigenvalue of the total $L_z$ operator is $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n**2. Understand the Measurement and the Final State**\n\n*   A measurement is made on the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum for each electron, which are represented by the operators $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n*   The basis for this measurement is the *uncoupled* basis, represented by states $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2>$, where $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the magnetic quantum numbers for electron 1 and electron 2, respectively.\n*   We want to find the probability of a specific outcome:\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This means we must find the system in a state with $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This means we must find the system in a state with $m_2 = -1$.\n*   Therefore, the final state corresponding to this measurement outcome is the uncoupled state $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2> = |1, -1; 1, -1>$.\n\n**3. The Core Principle: Relating Coupled and Uncoupled States**\n\n*   The probability of measuring the system, initially in state $|\\psi_{initial}>$, to be in a final state $|\\psi_{final}>$ is given by the square of the magnitude of their inner product: $P = |<\\psi_{final}|\\psi_{initial}>|^2$.\n*   In our case:\n    *   $|\\psi_{initial}> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$\n    *   $|\\psi_{final}> = |1, -1; 1, -1>$\n*   So, the probability is $P = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>|^2$.\n*   The term $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>$ is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.\n\n**4. Applying the Conservation of Angular Momentum (The Careful Point)**\n\n*   A fundamental rule in the addition of angular momentum is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the z-components of the individual angular momenta.\n*   Mathematically, the operator for the total z-component is $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n*   This leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers: **$m = m_1 + m_2$**.\n*   A Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $<l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m>$ is non-zero *only if* this condition is met.\n\n**5. Checking the Selection Rule for this Problem**\n\n*   From the initial coupled state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$, we have the total magnetic quantum number **$m = -1$**.\n*   From the desired final uncoupled state $|1, -1; 1, -1>$, we have the individual magnetic quantum numbers **$m_1 = -1$** and **$m_2 = -1$**.\n*   Let's calculate the sum for the final state: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n*   Now, we compare the total $m$ from the initial state with the sum from the final state:\n    *   $m = -1$\n    *   $m_1 + m_2 = -2$\n*   Since $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$, the selection rule is violated.\n\n**6. Final Calculation**\n\n*   Because the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is not satisfied, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient must be zero:\n    $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1> = 0$.\n*   The probability is the square of this coefficient:\n    $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n*   This means it is impossible to start in the state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$ and measure both electrons to have $m_z = -1$. The joint probability is zero.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe reasoning and the code output both lead to the same conclusion.\n\n**Summary of Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Initial State:** The system is in the coupled state $|l, m\\rangle = |2, -1\\rangle$. This state is an eigenstate of the total z-component of angular momentum, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with an eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Desired Final State:** We want to measure the individual z-components of angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, and get the eigenvalues $-\\hbar$ for both. This corresponds to a final state where electron 1 has $m_1 = -1$ and electron 2 has $m_2 = -1$.\n\n3.  **Conservation of Angular Momentum:** The total z-component of angular momentum must be conserved. For the final state, the total z-component would be $m_{total} = m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n4.  **Contradiction:** The initial state has a total z-component of angular momentum corresponding to $m = -1$. The desired final state has a total z-component corresponding to $m_{total} = -2$. Since these values are different, it is impossible to measure the initial state and find it in the desired final state. The probability of this outcome must be zero.\n\n5.  **Code Verification:** The provided code calculates the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, which is the projection of the initial state onto the final state. The output `The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is: 0` confirms that these two states are orthogonal. The probability is the square of this coefficient, which is $0^2 = 0$.\n\nTherefore, the joint probability is 0.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo determine the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of the orbital angular momentum components L₁z and L₂z, we must analyze the given quantum state.\n\n### 1. Understand the System and State\n*   **System:** Two electrons in a p orbital. This means their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are `l₁ = 1` and `l₂ = 1`.\n*   **State:** The system is in the coupled angular momentum state `|l₁, l₂, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>`.\n    *   `l = 2` is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number.\n    *   `m = -1` is the quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum. The eigenvalue of the total Lz is `mħ = -ħ`.\n\n### 2. The Measurement and Desired Outcome\n*   **Measurement:** The z-components of the individual angular momenta, L₁z and L₂z, are measured.\n*   **Desired Outcome:** We want to find the probability of getting an eigenvalue of -ħ for L₁z *and* an eigenvalue of -ħ for L₂z.\n    *   An eigenvalue of -ħ for L₁z corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number `m₁ = -1`.\n    *   An eigenvalue of -ħ for L₂z corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number `m₂ = -1`.\n\n### 3. The Conservation of Angular Momentum\nA fundamental principle in the addition of angular momentum is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. This is expressed by the quantum number relationship:\n`m = m₁ + m₂`\n\nThis rule acts as a selection rule: a coupled state `|l, m>` can only be composed of uncoupled states `|l₁, m₁>|l₂, m₂>` where the individual magnetic quantum numbers sum to the total magnetic quantum number.\n\n### 4. Applying the Rule to the Problem\n*   The system is in a state with a total magnetic quantum number `m = -1`.\n*   The measurement outcome we are interested in is `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1`.\n*   Let's check if this outcome is compatible with the state of the system:\n    `m₁ + m₂ = (-1) + (-1) = -2`\n\nSince the sum of the desired individual quantum numbers (`-2`) does not equal the total quantum number of the system (`-1`), it is impossible to obtain this measurement outcome.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\nThe probability of measuring an outcome that violates the conservation of angular momentum is zero. The coupled state `|1, 1, 2, -1>` is a superposition of states where `m₁ + m₂ = -1` (specifically, a combination of `|m₁=0, m₂=-1>` and `|m₁=-1, m₂=0>`). The state `|m₁=-1, m₂=-1>` is not a component of the given state `|1, 1, 2, -1>`.\n\nTherefore, the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both L₁z and L₂z as -ħ is 0.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThe problem asks for the joint probability of measuring the z-components of the orbital angular momentum ($L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$) of two electrons and finding the specific outcome where both yield an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the quantum state and the measurement process:\n\n1.  **Initial State**: The system consists of two electrons, each in a p orbital. This means their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$. The system is in a specific coupled angular momentum state given by $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. In this notation, $l$ is the total angular momentum quantum number and $m$ is the magnetic quantum number for the total angular momentum.\n\n2.  **Measurement**: A measurement is performed on the individual z-components of the angular momentum for each electron, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The possible outcomes for a measurement of $L_z$ for a particle with angular momentum $l=1$ are the eigenvalues $m_l\\hbar$, where $m_l$ can be -1, 0, or 1.\n\n3.  **Desired Outcome**: We want to find the probability of measuring the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ to be $-\\hbar$ (which corresponds to $m_{l1} = -1$) AND the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ to be $-\\hbar$ (which corresponds to $m_{l2} = -1$). This outcome corresponds to the uncoupled state $|m_{l1}, m_{l2}\\rangle = |-1, -1\\rangle$.\n\nThe connection between the coupled state $|l, m\\rangle$ and the uncoupled states $|m_{l1}, m_{l2}\\rangle$ is given by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The coupled state can be expressed as a linear combination (superposition) of the uncoupled states:\n$|l, m\\rangle = \\sum_{m_{l1}, m_{l2}} \\langle l_1, m_{l1}, l_2, m_{l2} | l, m \\rangle |m_{l1}, m_{l2}\\rangle$\n\nA fundamental selection rule for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, $\\langle l_1, m_{l1}, l_2, m_{l2} | l, m \\rangle$, is that they are zero unless the magnetic quantum numbers add up: $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = m$. This rule arises from the conservation of the z-component of the total angular momentum ($L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$).\n\nIn this problem, the system is in the state $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$. Therefore, any uncoupled state $|m_{l1}, m_{l2}\\rangle$ that contributes to this superposition must satisfy $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -1$. The possible combinations for $(m_{l1}, m_{l2})$ are (0, -1) and (-1, 0).\n\nWe are looking for the probability of finding the system in the state $|-1, -1\\rangle$. For this state, the sum of the magnetic quantum numbers is $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n\nSince $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -2$ is not equal to the total magnetic quantum number of the system, $m = -1$, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle 1, -1, 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle$ is zero.\n\nThe probability of measuring a specific uncoupled state is the square of the absolute value of its corresponding Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. Since the coefficient is zero, the probability is also zero. The state $|-1, -1\\rangle$ is not a component of the superposition that forms the state $|2, -1\\rangle$, and therefore, it is impossible to measure this outcome.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThe state of a composite quantum system can be described in a coupled or uncoupled basis. In this problem, the state of the two-electron system is given in the coupled basis, denoted by $|l, m\\rangle$, where $l$ is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number and $m$ is the magnetic quantum number, representing the projection of the total orbital angular momentum onto the z-axis. The individual angular momentum states are represented in the uncoupled basis by $|l_1, m_1\\rangle$ and $|l_2, m_2\\rangle$.\n\nThe key principle in the addition of angular momenta is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the z-components of the individual angular momenta. This is expressed by the quantum number relationship:\n\n$m = m_1 + m_2$\n\nThis relationship is a fundamental selection rule for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which are the expansion coefficients that relate the coupled basis to the uncoupled basis. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle$ is zero unless the condition $m = m_1 + m_2$ is met.\n\nIn this specific problem:\n*   The system is in the coupled state $|l, m\\rangle = |2, -1\\rangle$. This means the total magnetic quantum number is **m = -1**.\n*   We are asked for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of the individual z-component angular momenta, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, to both be $-\\hbar$.\n*   The eigenvalue of $L_z$ is given by $m\\hbar$. Therefore, an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number **$m_1 = -1$**.\n*   Similarly, an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number **$m_2 = -1$**.\n\nNow, we check if the selection rule is satisfied for this measurement outcome:\n\n$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$\n\nThe system is in a state where the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$. However, the proposed measurement outcome corresponds to a total magnetic quantum number of $m = -2$.

These coefficients are non-zero only if the selection rule $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$ is satisfied.\n\nIn this problem, the initial state is $|l=2, m=-1>$. This means the system has a definite total magnetic quantum number $m=-1$.

This corresponds to finding the system in the state where $m_{l1}=-1$ and $m_{l2}=-1$.\n\nLet's check if this outcome is possible. For this outcome, the sum of the magnetic quantum numbers would be:\n$m_{l1} + m_{l2} = (-1) + (-1) = -2$\n\nHowever, the initial state has a total magnetic quantum number of $m=-1$. Since $-2 \\neq -1$, this outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n\nThe probability of measuring the outcome $(m_{l1}, m_{l2})$ is given by the square of the absolute value of the corresponding Clebsch-Gordan coefficient:\n$P(m_{l1}, m_{l2}) = |<l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2} | l, m>|^2$\n\nWe want to find the probability for $m_{l1}=-1$ and $m_{l2}=-1$:\n$P(-1, -1) = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>|^2$\n\nBecause the selection rule $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$ is not satisfied (i.e., $-1 \\neq -1 + (-1)$), the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>$ is zero.\n\nTherefore, the probability is:\n$P(-1, -1) = |0|^2 = 0$\n\nIt is impossible to measure $m_{l1}=-1$ and $m_{l2}=-1$ when the system is in the state $|l=2, m=-1>$.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Initial State:**\n    The system consists of two electrons, each in a p-orbital. This means their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$.\n    The system is in a coupled angular momentum state described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n    In this state:\n    *   $l_1 = 1$ (orbital angular momentum of electron 1)\n    *   $l_2 = 1$ (orbital angular momentum of electron 2)\n    *   $l = 2$ (total orbital angular momentum quantum number)\n    *   $m = -1$ (z-component of the total orbital angular momentum quantum number)\n\n2.  **Understand the Measurement and Desired Outcome:**\n    A measurement of the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, is performed.\n    The possible eigenvalues of $L_z$ for a particle with angular momentum quantum number $l$ are $m_l \\hbar$, where $m_l$ can be $-l, -l+1, ..., +l$.\n    For a p-orbital ($l=1$), the possible values of $m_l$ are -1, 0, 1. The corresponding eigenvalues of $L_z$ are $-\\hbar, 0, +\\hbar$.\n    The question asks for the joint probability of getting the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ as $-\\hbar$ AND the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n    So, we are looking for the probability of finding the system in the uncoupled state described by $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2> = |1, -1; 1, -1>$.\n\n3.  **Relate the Coupled and Uncoupled Bases:**\n    The coupled state $|l, m>$ can be expressed as a linear combination of the uncoupled states $|m_1, m_2>$ using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients:\n    $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = \\sum_{m_1, m_2} <l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m> |l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2>$\n    The probability of measuring the system, initially in state $|l_1, l_2, l, m>$, and finding it in a specific uncoupled state $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2>$ is the square of the corresponding Clebsch-Gordan coefficient:\n    $P(m_1, m_2) = |<l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m>|^2$\n\n4.  **Apply the Selection Rule (Conservation of Angular Momentum):**\n    A fundamental property of angular momentum addition is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. This leads to a crucial selection rule for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients:\n    The coefficient $<l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m>$ is non-zero **only if** $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Probability:**\n    In our problem:\n    *   The initial state has $m = -1$.\n    *   The desired final state has $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n    Let's check the selection rule:\n    *   $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   Since $m = -1$ and $m_1 + m_2 = -2$, we have $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$.\n\n    Because the selection rule is not satisfied, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>$ must be zero.\n    Therefore, the probability is:\n    $P(m_1=-1, m_2=-1) = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>|^2 = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\n    **Alternative Explanation (Eigenvalue Argument):**\n    The operator for the total z-component of angular momentum is $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n    *   The initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$ is an eigenstate of $L_z$ with eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n    *   The final state we are measuring, $|1, -1; 1, -1>$, is also an eigenstate of $L_z$.

This means that a measurement of the total z-component of angular momentum, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, will yield the eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Desired Measurement Outcome:**\n    We want to find the probability of measuring:\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ as $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number $m_{l1} = -1$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number $m_{l2} = -1$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation of the Z-Component of Angular Momentum:**\n    A fundamental principle when adding angular momenta is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. This relationship holds for their quantum numbers as well:\n    $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$\n\n    This rule acts as a selection rule. For a coupled state with a specific $m$ to have a non-zero component in an uncoupled state with specific $m_{l1}$ and $m_{l2}$, this equation must be satisfied.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency:**\n    *   From the initial state, the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n    Now, we compare the total $m$ value of the initial state with the sum required by the final state:\n    Is $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$?\n    Is $-1 = -2$?\n\n    No, the equality does not hold.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Since the z-component of the total angular momentum is not conserved between the initial state ($m=-1$) and the desired final state ($m_{l1}+m_{l2}=-2$), it is impossible to obtain this measurement result. The probability of this outcome is exactly zero.\n\nThe probability is given by the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>$. This coefficient is zero because the selection rule $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$ is violated.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nMy apologies, there was a syntax error in the previous code attempt. The error arose from using incorrect parameter names for the `CG` function in the `sympy` library. However, the physical reasoning remains the same and is sufficient to solve the problem without needing a code-based calculation.\n\nHere is the corrected reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the System's State:** The initial state of the two-electron system is given in the coupled basis as $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n    *   $l=2$ is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number.\n    *   $m=-1$ is the quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum. This means the eigenvalue of the total z-component operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, is $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Measurement:** A measurement of the individual z-components of angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, is performed.\n\n3.  **Identify the Desired Outcome:** We want to find the joint probability of getting the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$ for *both* $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_{l1} = -1$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_{l2} = -1$.\n\n4.  **Apply the Conservation Law:** A fundamental principle in the addition of angular momentum is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. This is expressed in terms of the quantum numbers as:\n    $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$\n\n5.  **Check for Consistency:**\n    *   From the initial state, we know the total magnetic quantum number must be $m = -1$.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers would be $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The initial state is an eigenstate of the total z-component of angular momentum $L_z$ with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$. This means that any measurement of the individual components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ must yield eigenvalues whose corresponding quantum numbers ($m_{l1}$ and $m_{l2}$) sum to -1. Since the desired outcome has components that sum to -2, it violates this conservation rule. Therefore, the event is impossible, and its probability is 0.\n\nFormally, the state $|l=2, m=-1>$ can be written as a linear combination of the uncoupled states $|m_{l1}, m_{l2}>$. This expansion only includes terms where $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -1$. The state we are interested in, $|m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1>$, has a sum of -2 and is therefore not part of the expansion. This means the two states are orthogonal, and the probability of transitioning from one to the other upon measurement is zero.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nTo determine the joint probability, we must analyze the initial and final states of the two-electron system in terms of their angular momentum quantum numbers.\n\n### Analysis of the System State\n\n1.  **Initial State**: The system is in a coupled angular momentum state represented by the ket `|l₁, l₂, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>`.\n    *   `l₁ = 1`: Orbital angular momentum quantum number of the first electron (since it's in a p orbital).\n    *   `l₂ = 1`: Orbital angular momentum quantum number of the second electron (also in a p orbital).\n    *   `l = 2`: The total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the system.\n    *   `m = -1`: The z-component of the total orbital angular momentum.\n\n2.  **Measurement and Final State**: A measurement of the individual z-components of orbital angular momentum, `L₁z` and `L₂z`, is performed.

This is expressed as:\n`m = m₁ + m₂`\n\nLet's check if this condition is met for the desired outcome:\n*   The initial state has `m = -1`.\n*   The desired final state has `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1`.\n*   The sum for the final state is `m₁ + m₂ = (-1) + (-1) = -2`.\n\nSince the total z-component of the initial state (`m = -1`) is not equal to the sum of the z-components of the desired final state (`m₁ + m₂ = -2`), the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for this transition is zero.\n\n` <1, -1, 1, -1 | 2, -1> = 0 `\n\nThe probability is the square of this coefficient, which is also zero. This means it is impossible to measure `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1` simultaneously when the system is in the state `|1, 1, 2, -1>`.\n\nTherefore, the joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both `L₁z` and `L₂z` as `-ħ` is 0.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nIn this problem, we are considering a system of two electrons in a p orbital, which means their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are \\(l_1 = 1\\) and \\(l_2 = 1\\).

The state `|2, -1>` is an eigenstate of the operator `L_z` with a corresponding eigenvalue of `mħ = -1ħ`.\n\n### Measurement and Conservation\n\nWhen a measurement of the individual components `L_1z` and `L_2z` is performed, the system collapses into a state where these quantities are well-defined. The eigenvalues of `L_1z` and `L_2z` are `m_1ħ` and `m_2ħ`, respectively.\n\nA fundamental principle of quantum mechanics is that the sum of the measured individual components must equal the total value for the system. Therefore, the measured quantum numbers `m_1` and `m_2` must satisfy the condition:\n`m_1 + m_2 = m`\n\nIn this specific case, `m = -1`, so any measurement of `m_1` and `m_2` must result in `m_1 + m_2 = -1`.\n\n### The Question\n\nThe question asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalue of `L_1z` as `-ħ` and the eigenvalue of `L_2z` as `-ħ`. This corresponds to the outcome:\n*   `m_1 = -1`\n*   `m_2 = -1`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIf we check the sum of these desired outcomes, we get `m_1 + m_2 = -1 + (-1) = -2`.\n\nThis result (`-2`) contradicts the known state of the system, where the total magnetic quantum number `m` is `-1`. Because the measurement outcome `m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1` would violate the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum for the given state, this outcome is impossible.\n\nThe probability of an impossible event is zero. This can also be seen by expressing the coupled state `|2, -1>` in terms of the uncoupled basis states `|m_1, m_2>`. The expansion would only contain terms where `m_1 + m_2 = -1` (specifically, a superposition of `|m_1=0, m_2=-1>` and `|m_1=-1, m_2=0>`). The state `|m_1=-1, m_2=-1>` is not a component of the `|2, -1>` state, and thus the probability of measuring it is zero.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the initial state and the measurement:**\n    *   The initial state of the two-electron system is given in the coupled angular momentum basis as $|\\psi> = |l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n    *   In this state, the total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$, and the quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum is $m=-1$.

The initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$ is an eigenstate of the total z-component operator $L_z$ with eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. The measurement outcome state $|1, -1; 1, -1>$ is also an eigenstate of $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$ with eigenvalue $(m_1+m_2)\\hbar = (-1-1)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$. Since these two states are eigenstates of the same Hermitian operator ($L_z$) with different eigenvalues ($-\\hbar$ and $-2\\hbar$), they must be orthogonal.

For a p-orbital, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is `l = 1`.\n2.  **Individual Particle States (Uncoupled Basis):**\n    *   For electron 1: `l₁ = 1`. The possible z-component quantum numbers are `m₁ = -1, 0, 1`.\n    *   For electron 2: `l₂ = 1`. The possible z-component quantum numbers are `m₂ = -1, 0, 1`.\n    *   The states in the uncoupled basis are denoted by `|l₁, m₁; l₂, m₂>`, or simply `|m₁, m₂>` since `l₁` and `l₂` are fixed at 1.\n3.  **Coupled State:** The system is in the state `|l, m> = |2, -1>`. This is an eigenstate of the total angular momentum operator `L²` (with `l=2`) and the total z-component of angular momentum operator `L_z` (with `m=-1`).\n4.  **The Measurement:** A measurement of the individual z-components of angular momentum, `L₁z` and `L₂z`, is performed.\n5.  **Desired Outcome:** We want to find the probability of getting an eigenvalue of `-ħ` for `L₁z` **and** `-ħ` for `L₂z`.\n    *   An eigenvalue of `-ħ` for `L₁z` corresponds to the state where `m₁ = -1`.\n    *   An eigenvalue of `-ħ` for `L₂z` corresponds to the state where `m₂ = -1`.\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for the probability of finding the system in the uncoupled state `|m₁, m₂> = |-1, -1>`.\n\n### The Fundamental Principle (Selection Rule)\n\nThe connection between the coupled basis `|l, m>` and the uncoupled basis `|l₁, m₁; l₂, m₂>` is governed by the rules of angular momentum addition, using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n\nA fundamental principle, or selection rule, for the addition of angular momentum is that the total z-component quantum number `m` must be the sum of the individual z-component quantum numbers `m₁` and `m₂`.\n\n> `m = m₁ + m₂`\n\nThis rule arises because the operator for the total z-component of angular momentum `L_z` is simply the sum of the individual operators: `L_z = L₁z + L₂z`. The state `|l, m>` is an eigenstate of `L_z` with eigenvalue `mħ`. The state `|l₁, m₁; l₂, m₂>` is also an eigenstate of `L_z`, and its eigenvalue is `(m₁ + m₂)ħ`. For the coupled state to have any component of a particular uncoupled state, their `L_z` eigenvalues must be the same, which means `m` must equal `m₁ + m₂`.\n\n### Applying the Principle to the Problem\n\n*   The system is in the coupled state `|l=2, m=-1>`. So, `m = -1`.\n*   The measurement outcome we are interested in corresponds to the uncoupled state where `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1`.\n*   For this outcome, the sum is `m₁ + m₂ = -1 + (-1) = -2`.\n\nWe compare the total `m` of the system with the sum required for the desired outcome:\n*   `m` of the system = -1\n*   `m₁ + m₂` of the desired measurement = -2\n\nSince `m ≠ m₁ + m₂` (`-1 ≠ -2`), the selection rule is violated. This means that the coupled state `|2, -1>` has no component of the uncoupled state `|-1, -1>`.\n\nThe probability of measuring `m₁` and `m₂` is given by the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, `|<l₁, m₁; l₂, m₂ | l, m>|²`. Because the selection rule `m = m₁ + m₂` is not satisfied, this coefficient is zero.\n\nTherefore, the probability of measuring `L₁z = -ħ` and `L₂z = -ħ` is 0.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Quantum Numbers:**\n    *   The initial state is a coupled angular momentum state $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n    *   The total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n    *   The measurement is for the individual z-components of angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n    *   The desired eigenvalue for both is $-\\hbar$.

This state is given in the $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle$ notation as $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   $l_1 = 1$: Orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 1 (p orbital).\n    *   $l_2 = 1$: Orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 2 (p orbital).\n    *   $l = 2$: Total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the system.\n    *   $m = -1$: The z-component of the total orbital angular momentum quantum number.\n\n2.  **Identify the Measurement and Desired Outcome:**\n    A measurement is performed on the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum for each electron, which are represented by the operators $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n    *   The desired outcome for electron 1 is an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for the operator $L_{1z}$.\n    *   The desired outcome for electron 2 is an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for the operator $L_{2z}$.\n\n3.  **Translate the Measurement Outcome into Quantum States:**\n    The eigenvalues of the $L_z$ operator are given by $m\\hbar$, where $m$ is the magnetic quantum number.\n    *   For the measurement of $L_{1z}$ to yield $-\\hbar$, the magnetic quantum number for electron 1 must be $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   For the measurement of $L_{2z}$ to yield $-\\hbar$, the magnetic quantum number for electron 2 must be $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for the probability of finding the system in the uncoupled state defined by $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Apply the Rules of Angular Momentum Addition:**\n    A fundamental principle when coupling angular momenta is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components.\n    *   Total operator: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$\n    *   Relationship between quantum numbers: $m = m_1 + m_2$\n    This relationship is a **selection rule**. It means that a coupled state $|l, m\\rangle$ can only be composed of uncoupled states $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$ for which the condition $m = m_1 + m_2$ is satisfied. If this condition is not met, the uncoupled state has no contribution to the coupled state, and the probability of measuring it is zero.\n\n5.  **Check the Selection Rule for this Specific Case:**\n    *   From the initial coupled state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, we have the total magnetic quantum number $m = -1$.\n    *   From the desired measurement outcome, we have the individual magnetic quantum numbers $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   Let's check if the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is satisfied:\n        $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$\n    *   We compare this sum to the total magnetic quantum number of the initial state:\n        $-2 \\neq -1$\n\n6.  **Determine the Probability:**\n    The probability of measuring the system in the state $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$ when it is initially in the state $|l, m\\rangle$ is given by the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient: $P = |\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle|^2$.\n    *   Because the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is not satisfied for our case, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle$ is necessarily zero.\n    *   Therefore, the probability of obtaining this measurement outcome is $P = 0^2 = 0$.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Coupled vs. Uncoupled Basis:** The problem starts in the coupled basis ($|l, m\\rangle$) and asks about a measurement outcome described in the uncoupled basis ($|m_1, m_2\\rangle$). The connection between them is the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n*   **The $m = m_1 + m_2$ Selection Rule:** This is the most crucial point. It allows solving the problem instantly without calculating any specific Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. It's a consequence of the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum during the coupling process.\n*   **Eigenvalues and Quantum Numbers:** Be careful to correctly translate the given eigenvalue ($-\\hbar$) into the corresponding magnetic quantum number ($m = -1$).\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\nThe initial state of the system is $|l, m\\rangle = |2, -1\\rangle$, so the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\nThe measurement asks for the joint probability of finding the individual magnetic quantum numbers to be $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\nThe sum of these individual quantum numbers is $m_1 + m_2 = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\nAccording to the rules of angular momentum addition, a coupled state with total magnetic quantum number $m$ can only be a superposition of uncoupled states where $m_1 + m_2 = m$.\nIn this case, $m = -1$ and the sum $m_1 + m_2 = -2$. Since $-1 \\neq -2$, the state corresponding to the desired measurement outcome is not a component of the initial state.\nTherefore, the probability of measuring this outcome is zero.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the initial and final states.**\n    *   The initial state of the two-electron system is given in the coupled basis as $|\\psi_{initial}> = |l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$. Here, $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for the two electrons (since they are in p-orbitals). The total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$, and its z-component quantum number is $m=-1$.\n    *   A measurement of the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, is performed. This means we are projecting the initial state onto the uncoupled basis, which consists of states of the form $|l_1, m_1>|l_2, m_2>$.\n    *   We want to find the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$ for both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The eigenvalue of $L_z$ is $m\\hbar$. So, an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ corresponds to a magnetic quantum number of -1.\n    *   The final state corresponding to this measurement outcome is $| \\psi_{final} > = |l_1, m_1> |l_2, m_2> = |1, -1>|1, -1>$.\n\n2.  **Understand the relationship between the coupled and uncoupled bases.**\n    *   The total z-component of the angular momentum, $L_z$, is the sum of the individual z-components: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n    *   This implies that the corresponding quantum numbers are also related by a sum: $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n    *   The initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$ is an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator with an eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n    *   The final state $|1, -1>|1, -1>$ is an eigenstate of both $L_{1z}$ (with eigenvalue $m_1\\hbar = -1\\hbar$) and $L_{2z}$ (with eigenvalue $m_2\\hbar = -1\\hbar$). For this state, the total z-component of angular momentum eigenvalue is $(m_1+m_2)\\hbar = (-1 + -1)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$.\n\n3.  **Apply the conservation principle (selection rule).**\n    *   When we express a coupled state $|l, m>$ as a linear combination of uncoupled states $|m_1, m_2>$, only the uncoupled states for which the condition $m_1 + m_2 = m$ is met will have non-zero coefficients. These coefficients are known as Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n    *   In other words, a measurement of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ on a system in a state with a definite total magnetic quantum number $m$ can only yield outcomes $(m_1, m_2)$ that satisfy $m_1 + m_2 = m$. This is a consequence of the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n    *   In our case, the initial state has $m = -1$. The desired final measurement corresponds to $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   Let's check the condition: $m_1 + m_2 = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   Since $m_1 + m_2 = -2$ and $m = -1$, we have $-2 \\neq -1$. The selection rule is violated.\n\n4.  **Calculate the probability.**\n    *   The probability of measuring the state $|1, -1>|1, -1>$ is given by the square of the absolute value of the inner product of the initial and final states:\n        $P = |< \\psi_{final} | \\psi_{initial} >|^2 = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>|^2$\n    *   The term $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>$ is the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for coupling the states $|1, -1>$ and $|1, -1>$ to get the state $|2, -1>$.\n    *   Because the condition $m_1 + m_2 = m$ is not satisfied (since $-1 + (-1) \\neq -1$), this Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero.\n    *   Therefore, the probability is $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\nThe joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$ is zero.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nThe search results confirm my reasoning.\n\n*   **Rule of m addition:** Several sources explicitly state that when adding two angular momenta, $j_1$ and $j_2$, to get a total angular momentum $j$, the z-component quantum number $m$ of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-component quantum numbers, $m_1$ and $m_2$. This is expressed as a selection rule for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which are the coefficients used to expand the coupled state in terms of the uncoupled states. The coefficient $<j_1, m_1; j_2, m_2 | j, m>$ is zero unless $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n\n*   **Initial State:** The system is in the state $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$. This is a coupled state. Here, the quantum number for the z-component of the *total* orbital angular momentum is $m = -1$.\n\n*   **Measurement Outcome:** We want to find the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ to be $-\\hbar$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ corresponds to the quantum number $m_{l1} = -1$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ corresponds to the quantum number $m_{l2} = -1$.\n\n*   **Analysis:** For the measurement outcome ($m_{l1} = -1$, $m_{l2} = -1$), the sum of the individual z-component quantum numbers is $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n\n*   **Contradiction:** The initial state has a total z-component quantum number $m = -1$. The desired measurement outcome corresponds to a state with a total z-component quantum number of $m_{total} = -2$.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The probability of measuring an outcome is given by the square of the amplitude of the projection of the initial state onto the final state. Because the initial state is an eigenstate of the total z-component operator $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$ with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$, and the measured state is an eigenstate of the same operator with a different eigenvalue ($-2\\hbar$), the states are orthogonal. Their inner product is zero. Therefore, the probability of this measurement is zero.\n\nThe reasoning holds. The answer must be D.\nFinal Answer Check:\nInitial state: $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$. This state is an eigenstate of $L_z = L_{1z}+L_{2z}$ with eigenvalue $-\\hbar$.\nMeasurement is made of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\nWe want the probability of getting eigenvalues $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ and $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$. This corresponds to the final uncoupled state $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1\\rangle$.\nFor this final state, the value of the total z-component of angular momentum is $m_{1} + m_{2} = -1 + (-1) = -2$. The eigenvalue of $L_z$ for this state is $-2\\hbar$.\nSince the initial state and the final state are eigenstates of the same operator ($L_z$) but with different eigenvalues ($-\\hbar$ and $-2\\hbar$), they are orthogonal.\nThe probability is the squared magnitude of the inner product of the initial and final states: $P = |\\langle m_1=-1, m_2=-1 | l=2, m=-1\\rangle|^2$.\nBecause the states are orthogonal, this inner product is zero.\nSo, the probability is 0.\nThe answer is D.\n\nFinal verification:\nThe expansion of $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$ in terms of $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$ is:\n$|2, -1\\rangle = \\sum_{m_1, m_2} \\langle 1, m_1; 1, m_2 | 2, -1 \\rangle |m_1, m_2\\rangle$.\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficients $\\langle 1, m_1; 1, m_2 | 2, -1 \\rangle$ are non-zero only if $m_1+m_2 = -1$.\nThe state we are interested in is $|-1, -1\\rangle$. For this state, $m_1+m_2 = -2$.\nTherefore, the coefficient $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle$ is zero.\nThe probability is the square of this coefficient, which is 0.\nThe logic is sound.In quantum mechanics, when adding two angular momenta, the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. This is a fundamental principle known as a selection rule.\n\nThe state of the two-electron system is given in the coupled basis as $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1,1, 2, -1>$.\nHere:\n*   $l_1 = 1$ is the orbital angular momentum quantum number of the first electron.\n*   $l_2 = 1$ is the orbital angular momentum quantum number of the second electron.\n*   $l = 2$ is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the system.\n*   $m = -1$ is the quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum.\n\nThe total z-component of the orbital angular momentum, $L_z$, is the sum of the individual components for each electron, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The corresponding quantum numbers are related by the rule:\n$m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$\n\nThe initial state of the system is an eigenstate of the total angular momentum operator $L_z$ with a total magnetic quantum number $m = -1$.\n\nA measurement is made of the individual orbital angular momentum components, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. We want to find the probability of obtaining the following eigenvalues simultaneously:\n*   Eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_{l1} = -1$.\n*   Eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_{l2} = -1$.\n\nFor this specific measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers would be:\n$m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n\nThis result, $m_{total} = -2$, contradicts the fact that the system was initially in a state with a total magnetic quantum number of $m = -1$. Because the quantum number for the z-component of the total angular momentum must be conserved, it is impossible to measure a combination of individual components that does not sum to the initial total.\n\nTherefore, the probability of finding the system in a state where $m_{l1} = -1$ and $m_{l2} = -1$ is zero.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nThe problem asks for the joint probability of measuring the z-component of orbital angular momentum for two electrons.\n\n### Analysis of the State\n\n1.  **System:** The system consists of two electrons, each in a p-orbital. For a p-orbital, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is `l=1`. Thus, we have `l₁ = 1` for the first electron and `l₂ = 1` for the second.\n2.  **Possible z-components:** The magnetic quantum number `m` can take integer values from `-l` to `+l`. For each electron, the possible values for their magnetic quantum numbers (`m₁` and `m₂`) are -1, 0, and +1. The corresponding eigenvalues of the z-component of angular momentum (`L₁z` and `L₂z`) are `mħ`, i.e., -ħ, 0, and ħ.\n3.  **Coupled State:** The two-electron system is in a coupled angular momentum state represented by `|l, m> = |2, -1>`. Here, `l=2` is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number, and `m=-1` is the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum quantum number.\n4.  **Conservation of Angular Momentum:** A fundamental principle of angular momentum addition is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. In terms of quantum numbers, this is expressed as:\n    `m = m₁ + m₂`\n\n### The Measurement\n\nThe question asks for the joint probability of measuring `L₁z = -ħ` and `L₂z = -ħ`. This corresponds to finding the system in a state where `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1`.\n\nLet's check if this measurement outcome is consistent with the given state of the system. According to the conservation rule, if we were to find `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1`, the total magnetic quantum number `m` would have to be:\n\n`m = m₁ + m₂ = (-1) + (-1) = -2`\n\nHowever, the system is explicitly stated to be in the state `|l, m> = |2, -1>`, which means its total magnetic quantum number is `m = -1`.\n\nSince the required measurement (`m₁ = -1`, `m₂ = -1`) would result in a total `m` of -2, which contradicts the system's actual state where `m = -1`, this measurement outcome is physically impossible.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe state `|l=2, m=-1>` is a superposition of states `|l₁, m₁>|l₂, m₂>` for which the condition `m₁ + m₂ = -1` is satisfied. The state corresponding to the measurement `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1` is `|l₁=1, m₁=-1>|l₂=1, m₂=-1>`. This state has a total `m` of -2 and is therefore orthogonal to the given state `|l=2, m=-1>`.\n\nThe probability of measuring an outcome that is inconsistent with the initial state of the system is zero.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nThe initial state of the two-electron system is given by the coupled angular momentum state $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.

The question asks for the joint probability of obtaining the eigenvalues of both operators to be $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to a final state where the magnetic quantum numbers for the individual electrons are $m_{l1} = -1$ and $m_{l2} = -1$.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, the coupled state $|l, m\\rangle$ is a linear superposition of the uncoupled states $|m_{l1}, m_{l2}\\rangle$. A fundamental principle of angular momentum coupling is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. That is, for any component in the superposition, the following condition must hold:\n$m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$\n\nIn this problem, the initial state has a total magnetic quantum number $m = -1$. The desired final measurement outcome is for $m_{l1} = -1$ and $m_{l2} = -1$. Let's check if this outcome is consistent with the initial state's total z-component of angular momentum:\nSum of the z-components of the desired outcome = $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n\nSince the sum of the individual z-components (-2) does not equal the total z-component of the initial state (-1), this particular outcome is physically impossible. The state $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the total angular momentum operator in the z-direction, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with an eigenvalue of $-1\\hbar$. The state corresponding to the measurement outcome, $|m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1\\rangle$, is also an eigenstate of $L_z$, but with an eigenvalue of $(-1 + -1)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$.\n\nBecause these two states are eigenstates of the same Hermitian operator ($L_z$) with different eigenvalues, they are orthogonal. The probability of measuring the initial state to be in this final state is given by the square of the magnitude of their inner product. Since the states are orthogonal, their inner product is zero.\n\nProbability = $|\\langle m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1 | l=2, m=-1 \\rangle|^2 = 0^2 = 0$.\n\nTherefore, the joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$ is 0.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the Initial State:** The system consists of two electrons, each in a p-orbital. For a p-orbital, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=1$.\n    *   Electron 1: $l_1 = 1$. The possible magnetic quantum numbers are $m_1 \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   Electron 2: $l_2 = 1$. The possible magnetic quantum numbers are $m_2 \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    The system is in a specific coupled angular momentum state, denoted by $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n    *   $l_1 = 1$ is the orbital quantum number for electron 1.\n    *   $l_2 = 1$ is the orbital quantum number for electron 2.\n    *   $l = 2$ is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the two-electron system.\n    *   $m = -1$ is the total magnetic quantum number, which is the projection of the total orbital angular momentum onto the z-axis.\n\n2.  **Understand the Measurement:** A measurement of the individual orbital angular momentum components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ is performed.\n    *   The operator $L_{1z}$ acts on electron 1, and its eigenvalues are $m_1\\hbar$.\n    *   The operator $L_{2z}$ acts on electron 2, and its eigenvalues are $m_2\\hbar$.\n    We are asked for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ as $-\\hbar$ and the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ corresponds to finding electron 1 in the state with $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ corresponds to finding electron 2 in the state with $m_2 = -1$.\n    So, we need to find the probability of observing the outcome $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, -1)$.\n\n3.  **Apply Fundamental Principles:** The key principle here is the relationship between the total magnetic quantum number ($m$) and the individual magnetic quantum numbers ($m_1$, $m_2$). The operator for the total z-component of angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-component operators:\n    $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$\n    The coupled state $|l, m>$ is an eigenstate of $L_z$ with eigenvalue $m\\hbar$. The uncoupled states $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2>$ (often written as $|m_1, m_2>$ for brevity when $l_1, l_2$ are known) are eigenstates of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ with eigenvalues $m_1\\hbar$ and $m_2\\hbar$ respectively.\n    When acting on an uncoupled state, the $L_z$ operator gives:\n    $L_z |m_1, m_2> = (L_{1z} + L_{2z})|m_1, m_2> = (m_1\\hbar + m_2\\hbar)|m_1, m_2> = (m_1+m_2)\\hbar|m_1, m_2>$\n    The coupled state $|l, m>$ can be expressed as a linear combination of the uncoupled states $|m_1, m_2>$:\n    $|l, m> = \\sum_{m_1, m_2} C_{m_1, m_2} |m_1, m_2>$\n    where the coefficients $C_{m_1, m_2}$ are the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n    For this expansion to be valid, applying $L_z$ to both sides must yield the same result.\n    $L_z|l, m> = m\\hbar|l, m> = m\\hbar \\sum_{m_1, m_2} C_{m_1, m_2} |m_1, m_2>$\n    $L_z \\left(\\sum_{m_1, m_2} C_{m_1, m_2} |m_1, m_2>\\right) = \\sum_{m_1, m_2} C_{m_1, m_2} (L_z|m_1, m_2>) = \\sum_{m_1, m_2} C_{m_1, m_2} (m_1+m_2)\\hbar |m_1, m_2>$\n    Comparing the two expressions, we see that for any term in the sum with a non-zero coefficient $C_{m_1, m_2}$, it must be that:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n    This is a fundamental selection rule for the addition of angular momenta.\n\n4.  **Solve the Specific Problem:**\n    *   The system is in the state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$, so the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n    *   We are looking for the probability of the measurement outcome $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, -1)$.\n    *   Let's check if this outcome is consistent with the selection rule: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=-1$, but the desired final state has a combined $m_1+m_2 = -2$.\n    *   Since $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$ (i.e., $-1 \\neq -2$), the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for this component, $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>$, is zero.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Probability:** The probability of measuring a specific outcome $(m_1, m_2)$ is the square of the magnitude of the coefficient of the corresponding state $|m_1, m_2>$ in the expansion of the system's state vector.\n    Probability $P(m_1=-1, m_2=-1) = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>|^2$\n    Since the coefficient is 0, the probability is $0^2 = 0$.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** It is impossible to measure the individual z-components of angular momentum to be $m_1=-1$ and $m_2=-1$ if the system is in a state with a total z-component of $m=-1$. The sum of the parts must equal the whole. Therefore, the joint probability is 0.\n\n(Optional) **Verification using Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients:**\nThe expansion of the state $|l=2, m=-1>$ in the uncoupled basis $|m_1, m_2>$ is given by:\n$|2, -1> = \\sum_{m_1+m_2=-1} <1, m_1; 1, m_2 | 2, -1> |m_1, m_2>$\nThe only possible pairs $(m_1, m_2)$ that sum to -1 are $(0, -1)$ and $(-1, 0)$.\nThe actual expansion is:\n$|2, -1> = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}|1, 0; 1, -1> + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}|1, -1; 1, 0>$\nAs we can see from this expansion, the state $|1, -1; 1, -1>$ is not a component of the state $|2, -1>$. Its coefficient is zero. Thus, the probability of measuring the system in this state is 0.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the initial state of the system.**\n    The system consists of two electrons, and its coupled orbital angular momentum state is given as $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   $l_1 = 1$: Orbital angular momentum quantum number of the first electron.\n    *   $l_2 = 1$: Orbital angular momentum quantum number of the second electron.\n    *   $l = 2$: Total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the two-electron system.\n    *   $m = -1$: The magnetic quantum number corresponding to the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum ($L_z$).\n\n    This state is an eigenstate of the total angular momentum squared operator, $L^2$, and the z-component of the total angular momentum operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. The eigenvalue of $L_z$ for this state is $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the measurement and the desired outcome.**\n    A measurement of the individual orbital angular momentum components, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, is performed.\n    We want to find the joint probability of the following outcome:\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This means the first electron is found in a state with magnetic quantum number $m_{l1} = -1$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This means the second electron is found in a state with magnetic quantum number $m_{l2} = -1$.\n\n3.  **Represent the measurement outcome as a state.**\n    The state corresponding to the measurement outcome is an eigenstate of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. This state is described in the uncoupled basis as $|l_1, m_{l1}\\rangle |l_2, m_{l2}\\rangle$.\n    For the desired outcome, this state is $|1, -1\\rangle |1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Apply the principle of conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.**\n    The initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the total z-component operator $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$ with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$.\n    The final state after measurement, $|1, -1\\rangle |1, -1\\rangle$, is also an eigenstate of $L_z$. Let's find its eigenvalue:\n    $L_z (|1, -1\\rangle |1, -1\\rangle) = (L_{1z} + L_{2z}) (|1, -1\\rangle |1, -1\\rangle)$\n    $= (L_{1z}|1, -1\\rangle)|1, -1\\rangle + |1, -1\\rangle(L_{2z}|1, -1\\rangle)$\n    $= (-1\\hbar |1, -1\\rangle)|1, -1\\rangle + |1, -1\\rangle(-1\\hbar |1, -1\\rangle)$\n    $= (-1\\hbar - 1\\hbar) |1, -1\\rangle |1, -1\\rangle$\n    $= -2\\hbar |1, -1\\rangle |1, -1\\rangle$\n    So, the final measured state has a total magnetic quantum number $m_{final} = m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the probability.**\n    The probability of obtaining a specific measurement outcome is given by the square of the magnitude of the inner product (or projection) of the initial state onto the final state.\n    Let $|\\Psi_{initial}\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$ and $|\\Psi_{final}\\rangle = |1, -1\\rangle |1, -1\\rangle$.\n    The probability is $P = |\\langle \\Psi_{final} | \\Psi_{initial} \\rangle|^2$.\n\n    We have established that $|\\Psi_{initial}\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of $L_z$ with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$, and $|\\Psi_{final}\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the same operator $L_z$ with eigenvalue $-2\\hbar$.\n    A fundamental theorem in quantum mechanics states that eigenstates of a Hermitian operator (like $L_z$) corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal.\n    Since the eigenvalues $-1\\hbar$ and $-2\\hbar$ are different, the states $|\\Psi_{initial}\\rangle$ and $|\\Psi_{final}\\rangle$ must be orthogonal.\n    Therefore, their inner product is zero:\n    $\\langle \\Psi_{final} | \\Psi_{initial} \\rangle = 0$.\n\n    The probability is then:\n    $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\n    This can also be understood using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The initial state can be expanded in the uncoupled basis:\n    $|l, m\\rangle = \\sum_{m_{l1}, m_{l2}} \\langle l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2} | l, m\\rangle |l_1, m_{l1}\\rangle |l_2, m_{l2}\\rangle$\n    The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2} | l, m\\rangle$ is non-zero only if the selection rule $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$ is satisfied.\n    In our case, $l=2, m=-1$, and we are interested in the component where $m_{l1}=-1$ and $m_{l2}=-1$.\n    The sum is $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n    Since $m = -1 \\neq -2$, the corresponding Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero. The probability, which is the square of this coefficient, is also zero. It is impossible to obtain this measurement result because it would violate the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:** The system is in the coupled angular momentum state $|\\psi_{initial}\\rangle = |l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the individual electrons.\n    *   $l = 2$ is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the system.\n    *   $m = -1$ is the magnetic quantum number for the z-component of the *total* angular momentum. This is a key piece of information. It means the system is in an eigenstate of the total angular momentum z-component operator, $\\hat{L}_z$, and a measurement of this quantity will *always* yield the eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Final State of the Measurement:** We want to find the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both $\\hat{L}_{1z}$ and $\\hat{L}_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$.\n    *   A measurement of $\\hat{L}_{1z}$ yielding $-\\hbar$ corresponds to the first electron having a magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   A measurement of $\\hat{L}_{2z}$ yielding $-\\hbar$ corresponds to the second electron having a magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   This measurement outcome corresponds to projecting the initial state onto the uncoupled basis state $|\\psi_{final}\\rangle = |l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Probability Calculation:** In quantum mechanics, the probability ($P$) of finding a system that is in an initial state $|\\psi_{initial}\\rangle$ to be in a final state $|\\psi_{final}\\rangle$ upon measurement is the square of the magnitude of their inner product:\n    $P = |\\langle \\psi_{final} | \\psi_{initial} \\rangle|^2$\n    For this problem, this becomes:\n    $P = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$\n\n4.  **Apply the Selection Rule for Angular Momentum Addition:** The operator for the total z-component of angular momentum is the sum of the individual operators: $\\hat{L}_z = \\hat{L}_{1z} + \\hat{L}_{2z}$. This physical relationship imposes a strict constraint on the corresponding quantum numbers. The inner product $\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle$, known as a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, is non-zero *only if* the following selection rule is satisfied:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n\n5.  **Check the Selection Rule:**\n    *   From the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, we have the total magnetic quantum number $m = -1$.\n    *   From the desired final state $|1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$, we have the individual magnetic quantum numbers $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   Now, let's check if the rule holds:\n        $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$\n    *   Comparing the required total $m$ with the sum of the individual parts:\n        $-1 \\neq -2$\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Since the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is not satisfied, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero.\n    $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle = 0$\n    Therefore, the probability is:\n    $P = |0|^2 = 0$\n\nThe physical interpretation is straightforward: the initial state has a definite total z-angular momentum of $-1\\hbar$. The measurement outcome we are testing for corresponds to a state with a total z-angular momentum of $(-1\\hbar) + (-1\\hbar) = -2\\hbar$. A system cannot be found to have a property (total $L_z = -2\\hbar$) that is different from the definite value it possesses (total $L_z = -1\\hbar$). The probability of such an event is zero.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Initial State:** The system is in the coupled angular momentum state $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$ indicate that both electrons are in p-orbitals.\n    *   $l=2$ is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number.\n    *   $m=-1$ is the quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum. This means a measurement of the total z-component of angular momentum, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, will yield the eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Understand the Measurement and Final State:** We are measuring the individual z-components of orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. We want to find the probability of getting the specific outcome where:\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the magnetic quantum number for electron 1 being $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the magnetic quantum number for electron 2 being $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   This desired final state is an uncoupled state, represented by the ket $|l_1, l_2, m_1, m_2\\rangle = |1, 1, -1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Principles of Quantum Mechanics:** The probability of obtaining this specific measurement outcome is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between the final state and the initial state.\n    *   Probability $P = |\\langle \\text{final state} | \\text{initial state} \\rangle|^2$.\n    *   $P = |\\langle 1, 1, -1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$.\n\n4.  **Use the Conservation of Angular Momentum:** The term $\\langle 1, 1, -1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle$ is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, which describes the transformation between the coupled and uncoupled bases. A fundamental rule for the addition of angular momentum is that the z-component is conserved. This means that the total z-component quantum number ($m$) must equal the sum of the individual z-component quantum numbers ($m_1 + m_2$).\n    *   From the initial state, we have $m = -1$.\n    *   From the desired final state, we have $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   Let's check the conservation rule: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** We see that $m = -1$ while $m_1 + m_2 = -2$. Since $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$, the conservation rule is violated. Therefore, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero.\n    *   $\\langle 1, 1, -1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle = 0$.\n    *   The probability is $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\nThis outcome is physically required. The initial state is an eigenstate of the total z-angular momentum operator $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$ with eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. Any measurement of the individual components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ must yield results that sum to this total value. The desired outcome, with eigenvalues $-\\hbar$ and $-\\hbar$, sums to $-2\\hbar$. Since $-2\\hbar \\neq -\\hbar$, this measurement outcome is impossible.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nThe problem asks for the joint probability of measuring the z-components of the orbital angular momentum for two electrons, `L₁z` and `L₂z`, to both be `-ħ`. This corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum numbers being `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1`.\n\nThe two-electron system is in a coupled angular momentum state represented by `|l₁, l₂, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>`. In this state:\n*   `l₁ = 1` and `l₂ = 1` are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for the two electrons (since they are in p-orbitals).\n*   `l = 2` is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the system.\n*   `m = -1` is the total magnetic quantum number, which corresponds to the z-component of the total angular momentum.\n\nA fundamental principle of angular momentum coupling in quantum mechanics is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the z-components of the individual angular momenta. This relationship also holds for their respective quantum numbers:\n\n`m = m₁ + m₂`\n\nIn this specific case, the system is in a state where the total magnetic quantum number `m` is -1. Therefore, any measurement of the individual magnetic quantum numbers `m₁` and `m₂` must result in values that sum to -1.\n\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific measurement outcome where `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1`. For this outcome, the sum would be:\n\n`m₁ + m₂ = -1 + (-1) = -2`\n\nThis result (`-2`) contradicts the known state of the system, where `m = -1`. Because this measurement outcome would violate the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum, it is a physically impossible event.\n\nThe probability of measuring an outcome that is inconsistent with the conservation laws of the system is zero. This can also be seen by considering the expansion of the coupled state into the uncoupled basis states using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The coefficient `<l₁, m₁, l₂, m₂ | l, m>` is only non-zero if `m = m₁ + m₂`. Since `-1 ≠ -1 + (-1)`, the corresponding Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero, and thus the probability, which is the square of this coefficient, is also zero.\n\nTherefore, the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both `L₁z` and `L₂z` as `-ħ` is 0.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nThe problem asks for the joint probability of measuring specific eigenvalues for the z-component of the orbital angular momentum for two electrons.\n\n1.  **Initial State:** The two-electron system is in a coupled angular momentum state `|l, m> = |2, -1>`. This means the total orbital angular momentum quantum number is `l=2`, and the quantum number for its z-component is `m=-1`.\n2.  **Individual Particles:** The electrons are in a p-orbital, so their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are `l₁=1` and `l₂=1`.\n3.  **Measurement:** A measurement of the individual z-components of orbital angular momentum, `L₁z` and `L₂z`, is performed.\n4.  **Desired Outcome:** We want to find the probability of measuring the eigenvalue `-ħ` for *both* `L₁z` and `L₂z`. This corresponds to the measurement outcome where the individual magnetic quantum numbers are `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1`.\n\nThe z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. This is true for both the operators (`L_z = L₁z + L₂z`) and their corresponding quantum numbers (`m = m₁ + m₂`).\n\nIn the initial state, the system has a definite total magnetic quantum number `m = -1`. This means that any measurement of the total z-component of angular momentum will yield `-1ħ`. Consequently, if we measure the individual components `L₁z` and `L₂z`, the sum of their outcomes `m₁` and `m₂` must equal the total `m`.\n\nSo, the condition `m₁ + m₂ = -1` must be satisfied.\n\nThe question asks for the probability of the outcome `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1`. Let's check if this outcome is possible:\n`m₁ + m₂ = (-1) + (-1) = -2`\n\nSince the required sum `(-2)` does not equal the system's total magnetic quantum number `(-1)`, this outcome is physically impossible. The state `|l=2, m=-1>` has no component corresponding to the state where `m₁=-1` and `m₂=-1`. The probability of measuring an impossible outcome is zero.\n\nTo be more formal, the probability `P` is the square of the absolute value of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient that connects the initial and final states:\nP = |<l₁, m₁; l₂, m₂ | l, m>|²\nP = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>|²\n\nClebsch-Gordan coefficients are zero unless `m = m₁ + m₂`. Here, `m = -1` and `m₁ + m₂ = -2`. Since `-1 ≠ -2`, the coefficient is zero, and the probability is zero.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nTo determine the joint probability, we must analyze the composition of the initial coupled state in terms of the uncoupled states of the individual electrons.\n\n### Key Principles\n1.  **Initial State**: The system is in a coupled angular momentum state denoted by `|l, m>`, where `l` is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number and `m` is the magnetic quantum number for the z-component of the total angular momentum. Here, the state is `|2, -1>`.\n2.  **Measurement State**: The measurement seeks to find the system in a state where the individual z-component eigenvalues are `-ħ` for both electrons. This corresponds to the uncoupled state `|m1, m2> = |-1, -1>`.\n3.  **Conservation of Angular Momentum**: A fundamental principle in the addition of angular momenta is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. That is, `m = m1 + m2`. This rule is a consequence of the properties of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which relate the coupled and uncoupled bases.\n\n### Analysis\nThe initial state of the 2-electron system is `|l, m> = |2, -1>`. This means the quantum number for the z-component of the total angular momentum is `m = -1`.\n\nThe measurement is for the outcome where `L1z` gives an eigenvalue of `-ħ` (so `m1 = -1`) and `L2z` gives an eigenvalue of `-ħ` (so `m2 = -1`).\n\nAccording to the rules of angular momentum addition, the z-component of the total angular momentum must be conserved. Therefore, for any possible outcome of `m1` and `m2`, their sum must equal the initial total `m`.\n\nLet's check if the desired outcome is possible:\n*   `m1 = -1`\n*   `m2 = -1`\n*   `m1 + m2 = -1 + (-1) = -2`\n\nThe initial state has `m = -1`, while the desired final state has a total `m` of -2. Since `-1 ≠ -2`, this outcome is not physically possible. The system, being in a state with a total `m` of -1, cannot be found in a configuration where the sum of the individual `m` values is -2.\n\nThe probability of measuring an outcome is given by the square of the amplitude of that outcome's state in the expansion of the initial state. This amplitude is represented by a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. The coefficient `<l1, m1; l2, m2 | l, m>` is zero unless `m = m1 + m2`. In this case, `<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>` is zero because `-1 + (-1) ≠ -1`.\n\nTherefore, the probability of finding the system with `m1 = -1` and `m2 = -1` is zero.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:**\n    The system of two electrons is in the coupled angular momentum state $|\\psi\\rangle = |l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    In this state, the total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$, and the quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum is $m=-1$. The state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the total z-component operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Measurement and Desired Outcome:**\n    A measurement of the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, is performed.\n    We want to find the joint probability of obtaining the following results:\n    *   For the first electron, the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   For the second electron, the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n\n3.  **Identify the Final State:**\n    The state corresponding to this specific measurement outcome is the uncoupled state $|\\phi\\rangle = |l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum:**\n    The total angular momentum operators are related to the individual ones by $\\vec{L} = \\vec{L}_1 + \\vec{L}_2$. For the z-components, this means $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This relationship also holds for the corresponding quantum numbers: $m = m_1 + m_2$. This is a fundamental selection rule in the coupling of angular momenta.\n\n5.  **Check for Consistency:**\n    *   For the initial state $|\\psi\\rangle$, we have $m = -1$.\n    *   For the desired final state $|\\phi\\rangle$, we would have a total z-component quantum number of $m' = m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n    Since the total z-component of the initial state ($m=-1$) is different from the total z-component of the desired final state ($m'=-2$), the measurement outcome is impossible.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Probability:**\n    The probability of finding the system, initially in state $|\\psi\\rangle$, in the final state $|\\phi\\rangle$ after a measurement is given by the square of the inner product of the two states:\n    $P = |\\langle \\phi | \\psi \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$.\n\n    The term $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle$ is known as a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. A key property (the selection rule mentioned above) of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients $\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle$ is that they are zero unless $m_1 + m_2 = m$.\n\n    In our case, $m_1=-1$, $m_2=-1$, and $m=-1$. Since $m_1 + m_2 = -2 \\neq m = -1$, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero.\n    $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle = 0$.\n\n    Therefore, the probability is:\n    $P = 0^2 = 0$.\n\nAlternatively, we can reason that the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the operator $L_z$ with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$. The state corresponding to the measurement outcome, $|1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$, is an eigenstate of the same operator $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$ with eigenvalue $(-1-1)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$. Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal. Thus, their inner product is zero, and the probability of measuring one state given the other is zero.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nTo determine the joint probability, we must express the coupled angular momentum state $|l, m\\rangle$ in terms of the uncoupled states $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle$. This relationship is defined by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n\nThe given coupled state is $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\nHere:\n*   $l_1 = 1$ (orbital angular momentum quantum number for electron 1)\n*   $l_2 = 1$ (orbital angular momentum quantum number for electron 2)\n*   $l = 2$ (total orbital angular momentum quantum number)\n*   $m = -1$ (the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum)\n\nWe want to measure the z-components of the individual angular momenta, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The measurement we are interested in is when both electrons yield an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$.\n*   For $L_{1z}$, an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n*   For $L_{2z}$, an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n\nThe probability of finding the system in the state $|m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1\\rangle$ upon measurement is the square of the absolute value of the projection of the initial state onto the final state:\n$P(m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1) = |\\langle l_1=1, m_1=-1; l_2=1, m_2=-1 | l=2, m=-1 \\rangle|^2$\n\nThe term $\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle$ is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. A fundamental selection rule for these coefficients is that they are non-zero only if the magnetic quantum numbers sum correctly:\n$m = m_1 + m_2$\n\nLet's check this condition for our specific case:\n*   The total magnetic quantum number of the initial state is $m = -1$.\n*   The sum of the magnetic quantum numbers for the desired measurement outcome is $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\nSince $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$ (as $-1 \\neq -2$), the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero.\n$\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle = 0$\n\nThis means that the state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$ is orthogonal to the state $|1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$. The state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$ is actually a superposition of states where $m_1+m_2 = -1$, specifically the states $|m_1=0, m_2=-1\\rangle$ and $|m_1=-1, m_2=0\\rangle$. It has no component along the $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1\\rangle$ direction.\n\nTherefore, the probability of measuring $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$ simultaneously is:\n$P = |0|^2 = 0$\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nMy plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  Identify the quantum numbers of the initial state of the two-electron system. The state is given as $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. So, we have $l_1=1$, $l_2=1$, $l=2$, and $m=-1$.\n2.  Identify the quantum numbers of the final state we are measuring. A measurement of the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$ for the z-component of angular momentum ($L_z$) corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_z = -1$. We want this outcome for both electrons, so the final state has $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n3.  Apply the fundamental conservation rule for the coupling of angular momentum. The total magnetic quantum number $m$ must be the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers, i.e., $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n4.  Check if this condition is met. The initial state has $m=-1$. The state we are measuring has a total magnetic quantum number of $m_1 + m_2 = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n5.  Since the total $m$ of the initial state (-1) is not equal to the sum of the individual $m$ values of the final state (-2), the transition is forbidden. In the language of quantum mechanics, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for this transformation, $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle$, is zero.\n6.  The probability is the square of the magnitude of this coefficient, which is $0^2 = 0$.\n7.

The eigenvalue of $L_z$ is $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Measurement and Desired Outcome:**\n    A measurement of the individual z-components of orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, is performed.\n    *   The desired outcome is that the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the magnetic quantum number for electron 1 being $m_{l1} = -1$.\n    *   The desired outcome is that the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the magnetic quantum number for electron 2 being $m_{l2} = -1$.\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for the probability of finding the system in the uncoupled state $|l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2}> = |1, -1; 1, -1>$.\n\n3.  **Method 1: Conservation of the Z-component of Angular Momentum (Quick Method)**\n    *   The operator for the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-component operators: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n    *   Similarly, the corresponding quantum numbers are related by the sum: $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$.\n    *   In the initial state, the system has a well-defined total magnetic quantum number $m = -1$.\n    *   The desired final state has individual magnetic quantum numbers $m_{l1} = -1$ and $m_{l2} = -1$.\n    *   For this final state, the total magnetic quantum number would be $m_{final} = m_{l1} + m_{l2} = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   A measurement of the components ($L_{1z}, L_{2z}$) cannot change the total z-component of the system's angular momentum. The initial state is an eigenstate of $L_z$ with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$, meaning any measurement result must be consistent with this value.\n    *   Since the initial total magnetic quantum number ($m_{initial} = -1$) is different from the total magnetic quantum number of the desired outcome ($m_{final} = -2$), it is impossible to obtain this outcome.\n    *   Therefore, the probability of this measurement outcome is 0.\n\n4.  **Method 2: Using Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients (Formal Method)**\n    *   To find the probability, we must express the initial coupled state $|l, m> = |2, -1>$ as a linear combination of the uncoupled basis states $|m_{l1}, m_{l2}>$. The probability of measuring the outcome $|-1, -1>$ is the square of the magnitude of its coefficient in this expansion.\n    *   The general expansion is:\n        $|l, m> = \\sum_{m_{l1}, m_{l2}} <l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2} | l, m> |l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2}>$\n        where the sum is over all $m_{l1}$ and $m_{l2}$ such that $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = m$.\n    *   For our case, $l_1=1$, $l_2=1$, $l=2$, and $m=-1$. We need to find the pairs $(m_{l1}, m_{l2})$ such that $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -1$. The possible pairs are:\n        *   $(m_{l1}, m_{l2}) = (0, -1)$\n        *   $(m_{l1}, m_{l2}) = (-1, 0)$\n    *   The expansion of the state $|2, -1>$ is therefore:\n        $|2, -1> = <1, 0; 1, -1|2, -1> |1, 0; 1, -1> + <1, -1; 1, 0|2, -1> |1, -1; 1, 0>$\n    *   From a table of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for coupling $j_1=1$ and $j_2=1$, we find:\n        *   $<1, 0; 1, -1|2, -1> = 1/\\sqrt{2}$\n        *   $<1, -1; 1, 0|2, -1> = 1/\\sqrt{2}$\n    *   So, the initial state is:\n        $|1, 1, 2, -1> = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} |1, 0; 1, -1> + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} |1, -1; 1, 0>$\n    *   We want to find the probability of measuring the outcome corresponding to the state $|1, -1; 1, -1>$.\n    *   The probability is given by the square of the amplitude (inner product):\n        $P = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | \\psi_{initial}>|^2$\n        $P = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} |1, 0; 1, -1> + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} |1, -1; 1, 0> \\right) |^2$\n    *   The uncoupled basis states are orthogonal. This means $<m'_{l1}, m'_{l2} | m_{l1}, m_{l2}> = \\delta_{m'_{l1}, m_{l1}} \\delta_{m'_{l2}, m_{l2}}$.\n    *   Therefore:\n        *   $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 0; 1, -1> = 0$\n        *   $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, -1; 1, 0> = 0$\n    *   The inner product is 0, and the probability $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth methods show that the probability of measuring $m_{l1}=-1$ and $m_{l2}=-1$ from the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$ is zero. This is because the desired outcome is inconsistent with the conservation of the z-component of the total angular momentum.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{0}$.\n**Reasoning:**\n1.  **Identify the states:**\n    *   The initial state of the system is given in the coupled basis as $|\\Psi_{initial}\\rangle = |l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   The measurement performed is of the individual z-components of orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n    *   We want to find the probability of obtaining the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$ for *both* $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{iz}$ corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_i = -1$.\n    *   Therefore, the final state we are projecting onto is the state where electron 1 has $m_1 = -1$ and electron 2 has $m_2 = -1$. In the uncoupled product basis, this state is $|\\Psi_{final}\\rangle = |l_1, m_1\\rangle |l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1\\rangle_1 |1, -1\\rangle_2$.\n\n2.  **Calculate the probability:**\n    *   According to the principles of quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring the system in the state $|\\Psi_{final}\\rangle$ when it was initially in $|\\Psi_{initial}\\rangle$ is given by the square of the absolute value of their inner product:\n        $P = |\\langle \\Psi_{final} | \\Psi_{initial} \\rangle|^2$.\n    *   Substituting the states, we have:\n        $P = |\\left( \\langle 1, -1 | \\langle 1, -1 | \\right) |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle|^2$.\n    *   This inner product, $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle$, is known as a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.\n\n3.  **Apply the selection rule:**\n    *   A fundamental rule in the addition of angular momenta is the conservation of the z-component. This translates to a selection rule for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients: the coefficient $\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle$ can only be non-zero if the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers equals the total magnetic quantum number.\n    *   **Selection Rule:** $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n    *   In our case:\n        *   From the final state, $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n        *   From the initial state, the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n    *   Let's check the rule: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   Since $m_1 + m_2 = -2$ is not equal to the system's total $m = -1$, the selection rule is violated.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Because the selection rule is not satisfied, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero.\n        $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle = 0$.\n    *   Therefore, the probability of this specific outcome is $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n    *   This result was confirmed by the python code execution, which also calculated the probability to be 0. Physically, it is impossible for a system with a total angular momentum z-component of $-1\\hbar$ to be composed of two subsystems that have a sum of z-components of $-2\\hbar$.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nThe problem asks for the joint probability of measuring the z-component of orbital angular momentum for two electrons. The key to solving this lies in the principles of angular momentum coupling in quantum mechanics.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1.  **Identify the system and state:**\n    *   We have two electrons in a p-orbital, which means their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are `l₁ = 1` and `l₂ = 1`.\n    *   The combined 2-electron system is in a coupled state represented by `|l, m⟩ = |2, -1⟩`, where `l=2` is the total angular momentum quantum number and `m=-1` is the magnetic quantum number for the total angular momentum.\n\n2.  **Identify the measurement:**\n    *   A measurement of the orbital angular momentum components `L₁z` and `L₂z` is performed.\n    *   We want to find the probability of obtaining the eigenvalue `-ħ` for *both* `L₁z` and `L₂z`.\n    *   The eigenvalue of the `Lz` operator is `mₗħ`. Therefore, an eigenvalue of `-ħ` corresponds to a magnetic quantum number `mₗ = -1`.\n    *   So, the question is asking for the probability of finding the system in a state where `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1`.\n\n3.  **Apply the rules of angular momentum addition:**\n    *   When angular momenta are coupled, the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the z-components of the individual angular momenta. This is expressed by the quantum number relationship: `m = m₁ + m₂`.\n    *   This relationship is a strict selection rule. The coupled state `|l, m⟩` is a superposition of the uncoupled states `|l₁, m₁; l₂, m₂⟩`. A specific uncoupled state can only contribute to the superposition if its magnetic quantum numbers satisfy `m₁ + m₂ = m`.\n\n4.  **Check for conservation:**\n    *   The given total state is `|l=2, m=-1⟩`, so the total magnetic quantum number is `m = -1`.\n    *   The desired measurement outcome is `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1`.\n    *   Let's check if the sum `m₁ + m₂` equals `m`:\n        *   `m₁ + m₂ = (-1) + (-1) = -2`\n    *   We see that `-2 ≠ -1`.\n\n5.  **Determine the probability:**\n    *   The probability of measuring a system in state `|ψ⟩` to be in a particular eigenstate `|φ⟩` is given by the square of the absolute value of the inner product, `|⟨φ|ψ⟩|²`.\n    *   In our case, we want the probability of finding the system in the state `|l₁, m₁; l₂, m₂⟩ = |1, -1; 1, -1⟩` when it is in the state `|l, m⟩ = |2, -1⟩`.\n    *   The probability is `|⟨1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1⟩|²`.\n    *   The term `⟨1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1⟩` is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. Because the condition `m = m₁ + m₂` is not met, this coefficient is zero.\n    *   Therefore, the probability is `0² = 0`.\n\nThere is a zero probability of measuring `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1` simultaneously because it would violate the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\n### Analysis of the Quantum State\n\nThe problem asks for the joint probability of measuring specific eigenvalues for the z-component of the orbital angular momentum of two electrons. The initial state of the two-electron system is a coupled angular momentum state.\n\nThe key principles to solve this problem are:\n1.  **Conservation of Angular Momentum:** When angular momenta are combined, the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components.\n2.  **State Decomposition:** A coupled angular momentum state can be expressed as a linear combination of uncoupled states. The coefficients in this expansion are known as Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n3.  **Probability in Quantum Mechanics:** The probability of measuring a system to be in a particular state is the square of the absolute value of the amplitude (or coefficient) of that state in the system's wavefunction.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1.  **Identify the Quantum Numbers:**\n    *   The two electrons are in a p-orbital, which means their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are `l₁ = 1` and `l₂ = 1`.\n    *   The coupled state of the system is given as `|l, m> = |2, -1>`, where `l=2` is the total angular momentum quantum number and `m=-1` is the magnetic quantum number for the total angular momentum.\n\n2.  **Define the Measurement:**\n    *   A measurement of the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum, `L₁z` and `L₂z`, is performed.\n    *   We are interested in the probability of finding the eigenvalue of `L₁z` to be `-ħ` and the eigenvalue of `L₂z` to be `-ħ`. These eigenvalues correspond to the magnetic quantum numbers `m₁ = -1` for the first electron and `m₂ = -1` for the second electron.\n\n3.  **Apply the Selection Rule:**\n    *   A fundamental rule for the addition of angular momenta is that the magnetic quantum number of the total angular momentum (`m`) must equal the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers (`m₁` and `m₂`). This is often expressed as `m = m₁ + m₂`.\n    *   In the state we want to measure, `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1`.\n    *   The sum is `m₁ + m₂ = (-1) + (-1) = -2`.\n    *   The given total state of the system is `|l=2, m=-1>`, so the total magnetic quantum number is `m = -1`.\n\n4.  **Determine the Probability:**\n    *   The state we are measuring (`m₁ = -1`, `m₂ = -1`) has a total magnetic quantum number of `m = -2`. However, the system is in a state where the total magnetic quantum number is `m = -1`.\n    *   The probability of measuring a particular outcome (`m₁`, `m₂`) is given by the squared magnitude of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient `<l₁, m₁, l₂, m₂ | l, m>`.\n    *   Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are zero unless the selection rule `m = m₁ + m₂` is satisfied.\n    *   In this case, since `m₁ + m₂ = -2` and `m = -1`, the condition is not met.\n    *   Therefore, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient `<1, -1, 1, -1 | 2, -1>` is zero.\n    *   The joint probability is the square of this coefficient, which is `0² = 0`.\n\nThe state `|l=2, m=-1>` is a superposition of states where `m₁ + m₂ = -1`. Specifically, it is a combination of the states `|m₁=0, m₂=-1>` and `|m₁=-1, m₂=0>`. The state `|m₁=-1, m₂=-1>` is not a component of the initial state, and thus the probability of measuring it is zero.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nThe key to solving this problem lies in the conservation of the z-component of the total angular momentum.\n\nThe initial state of the two-electron system is given in the coupled representation as `|l, m> = |2, -1>`. In this state:\n*   `l` is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number.\n*   `m` is the quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum (`L_z`).\n\nA fundamental principle of quantum mechanics is that a measurement of an observable on a system in an eigenstate of that observable will always yield the corresponding eigenvalue. Here, the system is in an eigenstate of the total angular momentum z-component operator, `L_z = L_1z + L_2z`, with the eigenvalue `mħ = -1ħ`.\n\nThe problem asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of `L_1z` and `L_2z` to both be `-ħ`. This corresponds to finding the individual quantum numbers `m_1 = -1` and `m_2 = -1`.\n\nIf this measurement outcome were to occur, the z-component of the total angular momentum of the system would be the sum of the individual components:\n`m = m_1 + m_2 = -1 + (-1) = -2`.\n\nThis creates a contradiction. The initial state has a definite total angular momentum z-component corresponding to `m = -1`. The measurement outcome being considered corresponds to a total angular momentum z-component of `m = -2`. Since the z-component of angular momentum must be conserved during the measurement process, it is impossible to start in a state with `m=-1` and find the system in a state with `m=-2`.\n\nAnother way to see this is by using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The coupled state `|l, m>` can be expressed as a linear combination of the uncoupled states `|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2>`. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are the coefficients of this expansion. A crucial selection rule for these coefficients is that they are non-zero only if `m = m_1 + m_2`.\n\nWe are looking for the probability of finding the system in the state `|m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1>`. This probability is the square of the magnitude of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient `<l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m>`, which is `<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>`.\n\nSince `m_1 + m_2 = -2` and `m = -1`, the condition `m = m_1 + m_2` is not met. Therefore, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero, and the probability is zero.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nThe problem asks for the probability of a specific measurement outcome on a quantum system in a given state.\n\n1.  **Initial State**: The system of two electrons is in the coupled angular momentum state $|\\psi_{initial}\\rangle = |l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. This is an eigenstate of the total angular momentum operators $\\hat{L}^2$ and $\\hat{L}_z$. The eigenvalue of the total z-component of angular momentum, $\\hat{L}_z = \\hat{L}_{1z} + \\hat{L}_{2z}$, for this state is $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Measurement Outcome State**: We want to measure the individual z-components of angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The specific outcome we are interested in is getting eigenvalues of $-\\hbar$ for both. This corresponds to the uncoupled state $|\\psi_{final}\\rangle = |l_1, m_1, l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1, 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Probability Calculation**: In quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring a system in state $|\\psi_{initial}\\rangle$ to be in the state $|\\psi_{final}\\rangle$ is given by the square of the magnitude of their inner product:\n    $P = |\\langle \\psi_{final} | \\psi_{initial} \\rangle|^2$\n\n    Substituting the specific states:\n    $P = |\\langle 1, 1, -1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$\n\n4.  **Applying Selection Rules (Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients)**: The inner product $\\langle l_1, m_1, l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle$ is known as a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. A fundamental selection rule for these coefficients is that they are non-zero only if the z-components of angular momentum are conserved, meaning **$m = m_1 + m_2$**.\n\n5.  **Checking the Condition**:\n    *   From the initial state, the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n    *   From the desired final state, the individual magnetic quantum numbers are $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   The sum is $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n6.  **Conclusion**: Since $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$ (because $-1 \\neq -2$), the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero.\n    $\\langle 1, 1, -1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle = 0$\n\n    Therefore, the probability is:\n    $P = 0^2 = 0$\n\nThis means it is impossible to obtain the measurement outcome where both electrons have a z-component of angular momentum of $-\\hbar$ if the total system has a z-component of angular momentum of $-1\\hbar$.\n\nThe provided code output confirms this reasoning. The calculated Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is 0, which leads to a probability of 0.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nThe user's question asks for the joint probability of measuring the z-components of orbital angular momentum for two electrons.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the initial state:** The system is in the coupled angular momentum state $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   $l_1 = 1$: Orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 1 (since it's in a p-orbital).\n    *   $l_2 = 1$: Orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 2 (also in a p-orbital).\n    *   $l = 2$: The total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the 2-electron system.\n    *   $m = -1$: The magnetic quantum number corresponding to the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum, $L_z$. The eigenvalue of $L_z$ for this state is $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the measured state:** We want to find the probability of a specific measurement outcome.\n    *   The measurement of $L_{1z}$ gives an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$. The operator for the z-component of angular momentum is $L_z$, and its eigenvalues are $m_l \\hbar$. Therefore, an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ corresponds to a magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   The measurement of $L_{2z}$ gives an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to a magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   So, we are asking for the probability of finding the system in the state where electron 1 has $m_1 = -1$ and electron 2 has $m_2 = -1$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum:** In quantum mechanics, when adding angular momenta, the z-component of the total angular momentum is simply the sum of the individual z-components.\n    *   Operator relation: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$\n    *   Quantum number relation: $m = m_1 + m_2$\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency:** A measurement of the individual components ($m_1, m_2$) is only possible if their sum equals the total magnetic quantum number ($m$) of the system's state.\n    *   From the initial state, we know the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers would be $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   Comparing these two values: The system's total $m$ is -1, but the sum of the measured components is -2.\n    *   Since $m_1 + m_2 \\neq m$ (i.e., $-2 \\neq -1$), this measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n\n5.  **Conclusion on Probability:** A measurement outcome that violates a conservation law is impossible. Therefore, the probability of observing this outcome is exactly zero.\n\n6.  **Formal Justification (Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients):**\n    The probability of finding the system, which is in the coupled state $|l, m\\rangle$, in the uncoupled state $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$ is given by the square of the corresponding Clebsch-Gordan coefficient:\n    $P(m_1, m_2) = |\\langle l_1, m_1, l_2, m_2 | l, m\\rangle|^2$.\n\n    For our problem, this is:\n    $P(m_1=-1, m_2=-1) = |\\langle 1, -1, 1, -1 | 2, -1\\rangle|^2$.\n\n    A fundamental property of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is that they are non-zero only if $m_1 + m_2 = m$. As we have shown, this condition is not met. Therefore, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero.\n\n    $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\nThe Python code execution in the scratchpad confirms this calculation, yielding a probability of 0.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Initial State**\n\nThe system is initially in a coupled angular momentum state given by $|\\Psi_{initial}\\rangle = |l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\nThis state is an eigenstate of the total z-component of the orbital angular momentum operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. The total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$. This means a measurement of the total z-component of angular momentum would yield the value $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$ with certainty.\n\n**2. Identify the State Corresponding to the Measurement Outcome**\n\nThe problem asks for the joint probability of measuring the individual z-components of angular momentum and getting specific eigenvalues:\n*   The eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n*   The eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n\nThis measurement outcome is represented by a state in the uncoupled basis: $|\\Psi_{final}\\rangle = |l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n**3. Apply the Law of Conservation of Angular Momentum**\n\nA fundamental rule for the addition of angular momenta is that the total magnetic quantum number must be the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers:\n$m = m_1 + m_2$\n\nLet's check this rule for our scenario:\n*   From the initial state, the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n*   From the final measurement state, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\nSince $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$ (because $-1 \\neq -2$), the transition from the initial state to this final state is forbidden by the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n\n**4. Calculate the Probability**\n\nThe probability of finding the system in the state $|\\Psi_{final}\\rangle$ upon measurement is given by the square of the magnitude of the inner product of the initial and final states:\n$P = |\\langle \\Psi_{final} | \\Psi_{initial} \\rangle|^2$\n\nThe inner product $\\langle \\Psi_{final} | \\Psi_{initial} \\rangle$ is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle$. The selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ dictates that this coefficient is zero.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider that $|\\Psi_{initial}\\rangle$ and $|\\Psi_{final}\\rangle$ are both eigenstates of the same operator $L_z$ but with different eigenvalues ($-1\\hbar$ and $-2\\hbar$, respectively). Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator corresponding to different eigenvalues are always orthogonal. Therefore, their inner product is zero.\n\n$\\langle \\Psi_{final} | \\Psi_{initial} \\rangle = 0$\n\nThus, the probability is:\n$P = |0|^2 = 0$\n\nIt is impossible to find the system in a state with a total z-component of angular momentum of $-2\\hbar$ when it started in a state with a total z-component of $-1\\hbar$.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nThe code execution returned `0`, which confirms the reasoning.\n\nThe problem asks for the probability of measuring the z-components of the individual orbital angular momenta, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, to both be $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to finding the system in the uncoupled state $|m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1\\rangle$.\n\nThe system is initially in the coupled state $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$. The key principle in coupling angular momenta is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. This is expressed by the selection rule for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients: the coefficient $\\langle l_1, m_1, l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle$ is non-zero only if $m_1 + m_2 = m$.\n\nIn this specific case:\n*   The total magnetic quantum number of the initial state is $m = -1$.\n*   The magnetic quantum numbers of the desired final state are $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n*   The sum of the final magnetic quantum numbers is $m_1 + m_2 = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n\nSince $m_1 + m_2 = -2$ and $m = -1$, the condition $m_1 + m_2 = m$ is not met. Therefore, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient that connects these states is zero. The probability, which is the square of the magnitude of this coefficient, is also zero.\n\nPhysically, this means it is impossible for a system with a total z-component of angular momentum of $-1\\hbar$ to be measured and found to have a total z-component of $-2\\hbar$. Conservation of the z-component of angular momentum forbids this outcome.\n\nThe Python code confirmed this by explicitly calculating the relevant Clebsch-Gordan coefficient and showing the resulting probability is 0.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nTo determine the joint probability, we must analyze the initial and final states of the two-electron system.\n\n**1. Understand the Initial State:**\nThe system is initially in a coupled angular momentum state described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n*   $l_1 = 1$ is the orbital angular momentum quantum number of the first electron.\n*   $l_2 = 1$ is the orbital angular momentum quantum number of the second electron.\n*   $l = 2$ is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the system.\n*   $m = -1$ is the total magnetic quantum number, which corresponds to the z-component of the total angular momentum ($L_z$).\n\n**2. Understand the Measurement and Final State:**\nA measurement of the z-components of the individual angular momenta, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, is performed. We want to find the probability of obtaining the following specific outcomes:\n*   For the first electron ($L_{1z}$), the eigenvalue is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_{l1} = -1$.\n*   For the second electron ($L_{2z}$), the eigenvalue is also $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_{l2} = -1$.\n\nThis final measured state is described in the uncoupled basis as $|l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2}> = |1, -1; 1, -1>$.\n\n**3. Apply the Conservation of the Z-Component of Angular Momentum:**\nA fundamental principle in quantum mechanics is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the z-components of the individual angular momenta. This is expressed in terms of the magnetic quantum numbers as:\n$m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$\n\nIn the initial state of the system, the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\nFor the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers would be:\n$m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -1 + (-1) = -2$\n\nSince the total magnetic quantum number of the initial state (m = -1) does not equal the sum of the magnetic quantum numbers of the measured state (-2), this measurement outcome violates the law of conservation of angular momentum.\n\n**4. Calculate the Probability:**\nThe probability of measuring a certain outcome is given by the square of the magnitude of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, which connects the coupled state to the uncoupled state. Specifically, the probability is $|<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>|^2$.\n\nBecause the condition $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$ is not met, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for this transition is zero. This means that the expansion of the coupled state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$ into the uncoupled basis does not contain the term $|1, -1; 1, -1>$. The only terms present in the expansion must satisfy $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -1$, which are combinations like $|1, 0; 1, -1>$ and $|1, -1; 1, 0>$.\n\nTherefore, the probability of obtaining a measurement where $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ both have eigenvalues of $-\\hbar$ is zero.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nThe problem asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both the z-component of the orbital angular momentum of electron 1 ($L_{1z}$) and electron 2 ($L_{2z}$) to be $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to finding the probability that a measurement will yield the quantum numbers $m_{l1} = -1$ and $m_{l2} = -1$.\n\nThe two-electron system is in a coupled angular momentum state described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1,1, 2, -1>$. In this state, the total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$, and the quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum is $m=-1$.\n\nThe total z-component of the angular momentum is the sum of the individual components: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. A fundamental principle of quantum mechanics is that if a system is in an eigenstate of an operator, any measurement of the corresponding observable will yield the eigenvalue of that state. In this case, the system is in an eigenstate of the total angular momentum z-component operator, $L_z$, with a well-defined eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\nWhen a joint measurement of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ is performed, the sum of the outcomes must equal the total z-component of the angular momentum. The eigenvalues of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ are given by $m_{l1}\\hbar$ and $m_{l2}\\hbar$, respectively. Therefore, any measurement must satisfy the condition $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = m = -1$.\n\nThe question asks for the probability of the outcome where $m_{l1} = -1$ and $m_{l2} = -1$. For this specific outcome, the sum of the z-component quantum numbers would be $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n\nSince this resulting total z-component ($m=-2$) is different from the system's well-defined total z-component ($m=-1$), this outcome violates the conservation of angular momentum. Therefore, the probability of observing this outcome is zero.\n\nTo confirm this with a formal calculation, one can express the coupled state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$ in the uncoupled basis $|m_{l1}, m_{l2}>$ using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\nThe expansion is:\n$|1, 1, 2, -1> = <1, 0; 1, -1|2, -1>|1, 0; 1, -1> + <1, -1; 1, 0|2, -1>|1, -1; 1, 0>$\nUsing a standard table of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, both coefficients are $\\sqrt{1/2}$:\n$|1, 1, 2, -1> = \\sqrt{1/2}|1, 0; 1, -1> + \\sqrt{1/2}|1, -1; 1, 0>$\n\nThe probability of finding the system in the state with $m_{l1}=-1$ and $m_{l2}=-1$ (denoted as $|1, -1; 1, -1>$) is the square of the magnitude of the projection of the system's state onto this target state:\n$P(m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1) = |<1, -1; 1, -1| (|1, 1, 2, -1>)|^2$\n$P = |<1, -1; 1, -1| (\\sqrt{1/2}|1, 0; 1, -1> + \\sqrt{1/2}|1, -1; 1, 0>)|^2$\n\nDue to the orthonormality of the basis vectors, the inner product $<1, -1; 1, -1|1, 0; 1, -1>$ is 0, and the inner product $<1, -1; 1, -1|1, -1; 1, 0>$ is also 0. Thus, the entire expression evaluates to 0, and the probability is $0^2=0$.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nThe problem asks for the joint probability of measuring the z-components of orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, for two electrons and finding the specific eigenvalues of $-\\hbar$ for both.\n\n### 1. Define the System and the States\n\n*   **Individual Electrons:** The two electrons are in a *p* orbital, which means their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$.\n*   **Individual Magnetic Quantum Numbers ($m_l$):** For an electron with $l=1$, the possible magnetic quantum numbers ($m_l$) are -1, 0, and +1.

This uncoupled product state is written as $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1\\rangle$.\n\n### 2. The Principle of Angular Momentum Conservation\n\nA fundamental principle in the coupling of angular momenta is the conservation of the z-component. The total magnetic quantum number, $m$, of a coupled state must be equal to the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers, $m_1$ and $m_2$, of the uncoupled states that compose it.\n\nMathematically, this is expressed as:\n$m = m_1 + m_2$\n\n### 3.

Conclusion from Quantum Theory\n\nIn quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring a particular outcome is found by projecting the initial state onto the desired final state. The probability is the square of the magnitude of this projection. The coefficients for this projection are known as Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n\nThe probability P is given by:\n$P = |\\langle m_1=-1, m_2=-1 | l=2, m=-1 \\rangle|^2$\n\nThe term $\\langle m_1=-1, m_2=-1 | l=2, m=-1 \\rangle$ is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. These coefficients are non-zero only if the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is satisfied.\n\nIn this case, since $-1 + (-1) \\neq -1$, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero. Therefore, the amplitude for this transition is zero, and the probability is also zero.\n\nThere is a zero probability of jointly measuring the z-component of angular momentum for the two electrons to be $-\\hbar$ each, because such an outcome would violate the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided answers to determine the correct final answer.\n\n### Analysis of the Physics\n\nThe core of this problem lies in the principles of angular momentum addition in quantum mechanics.\n\n1.  **Initial State:** The system is in the coupled state $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. The crucial piece of information here is that the total magnetic quantum number is **m = -1**. This means the system is an eigenstate of the total z-component angular momentum operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with a precisely defined eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Desired Measurement Outcome:** We want to find the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ to be $-\\hbar$ and the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ to be $-\\hbar$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ corresponds to an individual magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n\n3.  **The Conservation Principle (Selection Rule):** A fundamental rule for the addition of angular momenta is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. This translates to a strict selection rule for the quantum numbers:\n    **$m = m_1 + m_2$**\n\n    This means that the initial state, which has a total $m$, can only be composed of uncoupled states for which the individual $m_1$ and $m_2$ values sum up to the total $m$. Any measurement of the individual components must respect this conservation law.\n\n4.  **Applying the Rule to the Problem:**\n    *   The initial state has a total magnetic quantum number of $m = -1$.\n    *   The desired measurement outcome corresponds to individual quantum numbers of $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   Let's check the sum for the desired outcome: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The sum of the measured components ($m_1 + m_2 = -2$) is not equal to the total z-component quantum number of the initial state ($m = -1$). This outcome would violate the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. Therefore, it is a physically impossible event. The probability of an impossible event is zero.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Coupled vs. Uncoupled Basis:** The problem starts in the coupled basis ($|l, m\\rangle$) and asks about a measurement in the uncoupled basis ($|m_1, m_2\\rangle$). The connection between them is the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n*   **Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients:** Formally, the probability is the square of a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. The selection rule is a property of these coefficients; if the rule is violated, the coefficient is zero.\n*   **Orthogonality of Eigenstates:** The initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the operator $L_z$ with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$. The measured state $|1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$ is also an eigenstate of $L_z$, but with eigenvalue $(-1 + -1)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$. Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator with different eigenvalues are orthogonal. Therefore, the inner product between the initial and final states is zero, and the probability is zero.\n\n### Synthesis of Candidate Answers\n\nAlmost all provided candidate answers correctly apply the reasoning above and conclude that the probability is 0.

The eigenstates of these operators form the uncoupled basis, denoted by $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2>$ or simply $|m_1, m_2>$ since $l_1$ and $l_2$ are fixed at 1.\n\n2.  **Identify the desired final state.**\n    We want to find the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ as $-\\hbar$ and the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $m_1\\hbar$. So, $m_1\\hbar = -\\hbar \\implies m_1 = -1$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $m_2\\hbar$. So, $m_2\\hbar = -\\hbar \\implies m_2 = -1$.\n    The final state corresponding to this measurement outcome is the uncoupled basis state $|m_1, m_2> = |-1, -1>$.\n\n3.  **Apply the principles of quantum mechanics to find the probability.**\n    The probability of measuring the system, initially in state $|\\psi>$, to be in a final state $|\\phi_{final}>$ is given by the Born rule:\n    $P = |<\\phi_{final} | \\psi>|^2$.\n\n    In our case, this is:\n    $P(m_1=-1, m_2=-1) = |<-1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>|^2$.\n\n4.  **Use the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.**\n    A fundamental principle in the addition of angular momentum is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components.\n    $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n    This implies that the corresponding quantum numbers also add up:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n\n    The initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$ is an eigenstate of the total z-component operator $L_z$ with eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$. This means the total z-component of angular momentum is precisely defined and has the value $m=-1$.\n\n    The final state we are interested in is $|-1, -1>$. For this state, the sum of the individual z-component quantum numbers is:\n    $m_1 + m_2 = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n\n    A measurement of the individual components $m_1$ and $m_2$ is also an indirect measurement of the total component $m = m_1 + m_2$. Since the initial state has a definite value of $m=-1$, any measurement of the individual components must yield a pair $(m_1, m_2)$ such that their sum is -1.\n\n    Because the desired final state has a total z-component quantum number of $m_{final} = -2$, which is different from the initial state's $m_{initial} = -1$, the transition is forbidden.\n\n5.  **Formal justification using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.**\n    The inner product $<m_1, m_2 | l_1, l_2, l, m>$ is known as a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. A key property of these coefficients is that they are non-zero only if $m_1 + m_2 = m$.\n    In our problem:\n    *   $m_1 = -1$\n    *   $m_2 = -1$\n    *   $m = -1$\n\n    We check the condition: $m_1 + m_2 = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n    Since $m_1 + m_2 \\neq m$ (i.e., $-2 \\neq -1$), the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero:\n    $<-1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1> = 0$.\n\n    Therefore, the probability is:\n    $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\nThe joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$ is 0.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThe problem asks for the joint probability of measuring the z-components of the orbital angular momentum of two electrons, `L_1z` and `L_2z`, to both have the eigenvalue `-ħ`. This corresponds to finding the individual magnetic quantum numbers `m_1` and `m_2` to be -1.\n\nThe state of the two-electron system is given as a coupled angular momentum state: `|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>`.\nHere:\n*   `l_1 = 1` is the orbital angular momentum quantum number of the first electron.\n*   `l_2 = 1` is the orbital angular momentum quantum number of the second electron.\n*   `l = 2` is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the system.\n*   `m = -1` is the magnetic quantum number corresponding to the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum.\n\nA fundamental principle in the addition of angular momentum is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the z-components of the individual angular momenta. In terms of their respective quantum numbers, this relationship is expressed as:\n`m = m_1 + m_2`\n\nThe system is in a state where the total magnetic quantum number `m` is definitively -1. This means that any measurement of the individual magnetic quantum numbers `m_1` and `m_2` must yield values that sum to -1.\n\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific measurement outcome where `m_1 = -1` and `m_2 = -1`. Let's check if this outcome is consistent with the state of the system.\nFor this outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers would be:\n`m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2`\n\nThis result (`-2`) contradicts the known total magnetic quantum number of the system (`m = -1`). Because the state `|m_1=-1, m_2=-1>` is not a possible component of the given state `|l=2, m=-1>`, the two states are orthogonal.\n\nTherefore, the probability of measuring `m_1 = -1` and `m_2 = -1` is zero. The coupled state `|l=2, m=-1>` is a superposition of states where `m_1 + m_2 = -1` (specifically, the states `|m_1=0, m_2=-1>` and `|m_1=-1, m_2=0>`). The state `|m_1=-1, m_2=-1>` is not included in this superposition, so its probability amplitude is zero.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThe problem asks for the joint probability of measuring specific z-components of orbital angular momentum for two electrons in a given coupled state.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the initial and final states:**\n    *   The initial state is the coupled angular momentum state `|l, m> = |2, -1>`. The key quantum number here is the total magnetic quantum number, `m = -1`.\n    *   The desired final state is determined by the measurement outcome. We want the eigenvalue of `L_1z` to be `-ħ` and the eigenvalue of `L_2z` to be `-ħ`. The eigenvalue of `L_z` is `m_q * ħ`, so this corresponds to measuring the individual magnetic quantum numbers `m1 = -1` and `m2 = -1`.\n\n2.  **Apply the conservation principle:**\n    *   In quantum mechanics, the addition of angular momenta follows specific rules. The relationship between the coupled state `|l, m>` and the uncoupled states `|m1, m2>` is described by Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n    *   A fundamental selection rule for these coefficients is that they are non-zero only if the z-components of the angular momentum are conserved. This means the total magnetic quantum number `m` must equal the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   So, we must have `m = m1 + m2` for the probability to be non-zero.\n\n3.  **Calculate and conclude:**\n    *   Check if the condition `m = m1 + m2` is met for this problem.\n    *   Initial state: `m = -1`.\n    *   Final state: `m1 + m2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2`.\n    *   Since `m ≠ m1 + m2` (`-1 ≠ -2`), the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient that connects these states is zero.\n    *   The probability of a measurement is the square of the magnitude of this coefficient.

Understand the System and the Initial State**\n\n*   The system consists of two electrons, each in a p-orbital. For a p-orbital, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=1$. So, for our two electrons, we have $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$.\n*   The problem specifies that we are ignoring spin angular momentum.\n*   The system is in a specific *coupled* angular momentum state, denoted by $|l_1, l_2, l, m>$. The given state is $|1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n    *   $l_1 = 1$: Orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 1.\n    *   $l_2 = 1$: Orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 2.\n    *   $l = 2$: Total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the 2-electron system.\n    *   $m = -1$: The quantum number for the z-component of the *total* orbital angular momentum ($L_z$). The eigenvalue of the total $L_z$ operator is $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n**2. Understand the Measurement and the Final State**\n\n*   A measurement is made on the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum for each electron, which are represented by the operators $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n*   The basis for this measurement is the *uncoupled* basis, represented by states $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2>$, where $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the magnetic quantum numbers for electron 1 and electron 2, respectively.\n*   We want to find the probability of a specific outcome:\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This means we must find the system in a state with $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This means we must find the system in a state with $m_2 = -1$.\n*   Therefore, the final state corresponding to this measurement outcome is the uncoupled state $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2> = |1, -1; 1, -1>$.\n\n**3. The Core Principle: Relating Coupled and Uncoupled States**\n\n*   The probability of measuring the system, initially in state $|\\psi_{initial}>$, to be in a final state $|\\psi_{final}>$ is given by the square of the magnitude of their inner product: $P = |<\\psi_{final}|\\psi_{initial}>|^2$.\n*   In our case:\n    *   $|\\psi_{initial}> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$\n    *   $|\\psi_{final}> = |1, -1; 1, -1>$\n*   So, the probability is $P = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>|^2$.\n*   The term $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>$ is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.\n\n**4. Applying the Conservation of Angular Momentum (The Careful Point)**\n\n*   A fundamental rule in the addition of angular momentum is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the z-components of the individual angular momenta.\n*   Mathematically, the operator for the total z-component is $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n*   This leads to a strict selection rule for the corresponding quantum numbers: **$m = m_1 + m_2$**.\n*   A Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $<l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m>$ is non-zero *only if* this condition is met.\n\n**5. Checking the Selection Rule for this Problem**\n\n*   From the initial coupled state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$, we have the total magnetic quantum number **$m = -1$**.\n*   From the desired final uncoupled state $|1, -1; 1, -1>$, we have the individual magnetic quantum numbers **$m_1 = -1$** and **$m_2 = -1$**.\n*   Let's calculate the sum for the final state: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n*   Now, we compare the total $m$ from the initial state with the sum from the final state:\n    *   $m = -1$\n    *   $m_1 + m_2 = -2$\n*   Since $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$, the selection rule is violated.\n\n**6. Final Calculation**\n\n*   Because the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is not satisfied, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient must be zero:\n    $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1> = 0$.\n*   The probability is the square of this coefficient:\n    $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n*   This means it is impossible to start in the state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$ and measure both electrons to have $m_z = -1$. The joint probability is zero.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe reasoning and the code output both lead to the same conclusion.\n\n**Summary of Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Initial State:** The system is in the coupled state $|l, m\\rangle = |2, -1\\rangle$. This state is an eigenstate of the total z-component of angular momentum, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with an eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Desired Final State:** We want to measure the individual z-components of angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, and get the eigenvalues $-\\hbar$ for both. This corresponds to a final state where electron 1 has $m_1 = -1$ and electron 2 has $m_2 = -1$.\n\n3.  **Conservation of Angular Momentum:** The total z-component of angular momentum must be conserved. For the final state, the total z-component would be $m_{total} = m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n4.  **Contradiction:** The initial state has a total z-component of angular momentum corresponding to $m = -1$. The desired final state has a total z-component corresponding to $m_{total} = -2$. Since these values are different, it is impossible to measure the initial state and find it in the desired final state. The probability of this outcome must be zero.\n\n5.  **Code Verification:** The provided code calculates the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, which is the projection of the initial state onto the final state. The output `The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is: 0` confirms that these two states are orthogonal. The probability is the square of this coefficient, which is $0^2 = 0$.\n\nTherefore, the joint probability is 0.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo determine the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of the orbital angular momentum components L₁z and L₂z, we must analyze the given quantum state.\n\n### 1. Understand the System and State\n*   **System:** Two electrons in a p orbital. This means their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are `l₁ = 1` and `l₂ = 1`.\n*   **State:** The system is in the coupled angular momentum state `|l₁, l₂, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>`.\n    *   `l = 2` is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number.\n    *   `m = -1` is the quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum. The eigenvalue of the total Lz is `mħ = -ħ`.\n\n### 2. The Measurement and Desired Outcome\n*   **Measurement:** The z-components of the individual angular momenta, L₁z and L₂z, are measured.\n*   **Desired Outcome:** We want to find the probability of getting an eigenvalue of -ħ for L₁z *and* an eigenvalue of -ħ for L₂z.\n    *   An eigenvalue of -ħ for L₁z corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number `m₁ = -1`.\n    *   An eigenvalue of -ħ for L₂z corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number `m₂ = -1`.\n\n### 3. The Conservation of Angular Momentum\nA fundamental principle in the addition of angular momentum is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. This is expressed by the quantum number relationship:\n`m = m₁ + m₂`\n\nThis rule acts as a selection rule: a coupled state `|l, m>` can only be composed of uncoupled states `|l₁, m₁>|l₂, m₂>` where the individual magnetic quantum numbers sum to the total magnetic quantum number.\n\n### 4. Applying the Rule to the Problem\n*   The system is in a state with a total magnetic quantum number `m = -1`.\n*   The measurement outcome we are interested in is `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1`.\n*   Let's check if this outcome is compatible with the state of the system:\n    `m₁ + m₂ = (-1) + (-1) = -2`\n\nSince the sum of the desired individual quantum numbers (`-2`) does not equal the total quantum number of the system (`-1`), it is impossible to obtain this measurement outcome.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\nThe probability of measuring an outcome that violates the conservation of angular momentum is zero. The coupled state `|1, 1, 2, -1>` is a superposition of states where `m₁ + m₂ = -1` (specifically, a combination of `|m₁=0, m₂=-1>` and `|m₁=-1, m₂=0>`). The state `|m₁=-1, m₂=-1>` is not a component of the given state `|1, 1, 2, -1>`.\n\nTherefore, the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both L₁z and L₂z as -ħ is 0.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThe problem asks for the joint probability of measuring the z-components of the orbital angular momentum ($L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$) of two electrons and finding the specific outcome where both yield an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the quantum state and the measurement process:\n\n1.  **Initial State**: The system consists of two electrons, each in a p orbital. This means their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$. The system is in a specific coupled angular momentum state given by $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. In this notation, $l$ is the total angular momentum quantum number and $m$ is the magnetic quantum number for the total angular momentum.\n\n2.  **Measurement**: A measurement is performed on the individual z-components of the angular momentum for each electron, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The possible outcomes for a measurement of $L_z$ for a particle with angular momentum $l=1$ are the eigenvalues $m_l\\hbar$, where $m_l$ can be -1, 0, or 1.\n\n3.  **Desired Outcome**: We want to find the probability of measuring the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ to be $-\\hbar$ (which corresponds to $m_{l1} = -1$) AND the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ to be $-\\hbar$ (which corresponds to $m_{l2} = -1$). This outcome corresponds to the uncoupled state $|m_{l1}, m_{l2}\\rangle = |-1, -1\\rangle$.\n\nThe connection between the coupled state $|l, m\\rangle$ and the uncoupled states $|m_{l1}, m_{l2}\\rangle$ is given by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The coupled state can be expressed as a linear combination (superposition) of the uncoupled states:\n$|l, m\\rangle = \\sum_{m_{l1}, m_{l2}} \\langle l_1, m_{l1}, l_2, m_{l2} | l, m \\rangle |m_{l1}, m_{l2}\\rangle$\n\nA fundamental selection rule for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, $\\langle l_1, m_{l1}, l_2, m_{l2} | l, m \\rangle$, is that they are zero unless the magnetic quantum numbers add up: $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = m$. This rule arises from the conservation of the z-component of the total angular momentum ($L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$).\n\nIn this problem, the system is in the state $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$. Therefore, any uncoupled state $|m_{l1}, m_{l2}\\rangle$ that contributes to this superposition must satisfy $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -1$. The possible combinations for $(m_{l1}, m_{l2})$ are (0, -1) and (-1, 0).\n\nWe are looking for the probability of finding the system in the state $|-1, -1\\rangle$. For this state, the sum of the magnetic quantum numbers is $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n\nSince $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -2$ is not equal to the total magnetic quantum number of the system, $m = -1$, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle 1, -1, 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle$ is zero.\n\nThe probability of measuring a specific uncoupled state is the square of the absolute value of its corresponding Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. Since the coefficient is zero, the probability is also zero. The state $|-1, -1\\rangle$ is not a component of the superposition that forms the state $|2, -1\\rangle$, and therefore, it is impossible to measure this outcome.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThe state of a composite quantum system can be described in a coupled or uncoupled basis. In this problem, the state of the two-electron system is given in the coupled basis, denoted by $|l, m\\rangle$, where $l$ is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number and $m$ is the magnetic quantum number, representing the projection of the total orbital angular momentum onto the z-axis. The individual angular momentum states are represented in the uncoupled basis by $|l_1, m_1\\rangle$ and $|l_2, m_2\\rangle$.\n\nThe key principle in the addition of angular momenta is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the z-components of the individual angular momenta. This is expressed by the quantum number relationship:\n\n$m = m_1 + m_2$\n\nThis relationship is a fundamental selection rule for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which are the expansion coefficients that relate the coupled basis to the uncoupled basis. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle$ is zero unless the condition $m = m_1 + m_2$ is met.\n\nIn this specific problem:\n*   The system is in the coupled state $|l, m\\rangle = |2, -1\\rangle$. This means the total magnetic quantum number is **m = -1**.\n*   We are asked for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of the individual z-component angular momenta, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, to both be $-\\hbar$.\n*   The eigenvalue of $L_z$ is given by $m\\hbar$. Therefore, an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number **$m_1 = -1$**.\n*   Similarly, an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number **$m_2 = -1$**.\n\nNow, we check if the selection rule is satisfied for this measurement outcome:\n\n$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$\n\nThe system is in a state where the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$. However, the proposed measurement outcome corresponds to a total magnetic quantum number of $m = -2$. Since $-1 \\neq -2$, this violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n\nThe probability of measuring a particular uncoupled state $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle$ from a coupled state $|l, m\\rangle$ is given by the square of the corresponding Clebsch-Gordan coefficient:\n\n$P(m_1, m_2) = |\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle|^2$\n\nBecause the condition $m = m_1 + m_2$ is not met, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle$ is zero. Consequently, the probability of this measurement is zero.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nAn electron in a p orbital has an orbital angular momentum quantum number $l=1$.

These coefficients are non-zero only if the selection rule $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$ is satisfied.\n\nIn this problem, the initial state is $|l=2, m=-1>$. This means the system has a definite total magnetic quantum number $m=-1$.

This corresponds to finding the system in the state where $m_{l1}=-1$ and $m_{l2}=-1$.\n\nLet's check if this outcome is possible. For this outcome, the sum of the magnetic quantum numbers would be:\n$m_{l1} + m_{l2} = (-1) + (-1) = -2$\n\nHowever, the initial state has a total magnetic quantum number of $m=-1$. Since $-2 \\neq -1$, this outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n\nThe probability of measuring the outcome $(m_{l1}, m_{l2})$ is given by the square of the absolute value of the corresponding Clebsch-Gordan coefficient:\n$P(m_{l1}, m_{l2}) = |<l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2} | l, m>|^2$\n\nWe want to find the probability for $m_{l1}=-1$ and $m_{l2}=-1$:\n$P(-1, -1) = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>|^2$\n\nBecause the selection rule $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$ is not satisfied (i.e., $-1 \\neq -1 + (-1)$), the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>$ is zero.\n\nTherefore, the probability is:\n$P(-1, -1) = |0|^2 = 0$\n\nIt is impossible to measure $m_{l1}=-1$ and $m_{l2}=-1$ when the system is in the state $|l=2, m=-1>$.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Initial State:**\n    The system consists of two electrons, each in a p-orbital. This means their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$.\n    The system is in a coupled angular momentum state described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n    In this state:\n    *   $l_1 = 1$ (orbital angular momentum of electron 1)\n    *   $l_2 = 1$ (orbital angular momentum of electron 2)\n    *   $l = 2$ (total orbital angular momentum quantum number)\n    *   $m = -1$ (z-component of the total orbital angular momentum quantum number)\n\n2.  **Understand the Measurement and Desired Outcome:**\n    A measurement of the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, is performed.\n    The possible eigenvalues of $L_z$ for a particle with angular momentum quantum number $l$ are $m_l \\hbar$, where $m_l$ can be $-l, -l+1, ..., +l$.\n    For a p-orbital ($l=1$), the possible values of $m_l$ are -1, 0, 1. The corresponding eigenvalues of $L_z$ are $-\\hbar, 0, +\\hbar$.\n    The question asks for the joint probability of getting the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ as $-\\hbar$ AND the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n    So, we are looking for the probability of finding the system in the uncoupled state described by $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2> = |1, -1; 1, -1>$.\n\n3.  **Relate the Coupled and Uncoupled Bases:**\n    The coupled state $|l, m>$ can be expressed as a linear combination of the uncoupled states $|m_1, m_2>$ using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients:\n    $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = \\sum_{m_1, m_2} <l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m> |l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2>$\n    The probability of measuring the system, initially in state $|l_1, l_2, l, m>$, and finding it in a specific uncoupled state $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2>$ is the square of the corresponding Clebsch-Gordan coefficient:\n    $P(m_1, m_2) = |<l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m>|^2$\n\n4.  **Apply the Selection Rule (Conservation of Angular Momentum):**\n    A fundamental property of angular momentum addition is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. This leads to a crucial selection rule for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients:\n    The coefficient $<l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m>$ is non-zero **only if** $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Probability:**\n    In our problem:\n    *   The initial state has $m = -1$.\n    *   The desired final state has $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n    Let's check the selection rule:\n    *   $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   Since $m = -1$ and $m_1 + m_2 = -2$, we have $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$.\n\n    Because the selection rule is not satisfied, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>$ must be zero.\n    Therefore, the probability is:\n    $P(m_1=-1, m_2=-1) = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>|^2 = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\n    **Alternative Explanation (Eigenvalue Argument):**\n    The operator for the total z-component of angular momentum is $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n    *   The initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$ is an eigenstate of $L_z$ with eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n    *   The final state we are measuring, $|1, -1; 1, -1>$, is also an eigenstate of $L_z$.

This means that a measurement of the total z-component of angular momentum, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, will yield the eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Desired Measurement Outcome:**\n    We want to find the probability of measuring:\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ as $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number $m_{l1} = -1$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum number $m_{l2} = -1$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation of the Z-Component of Angular Momentum:**\n    A fundamental principle when adding angular momenta is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. This relationship holds for their quantum numbers as well:\n    $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$\n\n    This rule acts as a selection rule. For a coupled state with a specific $m$ to have a non-zero component in an uncoupled state with specific $m_{l1}$ and $m_{l2}$, this equation must be satisfied.\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency:**\n    *   From the initial state, the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n    Now, we compare the total $m$ value of the initial state with the sum required by the final state:\n    Is $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$?\n    Is $-1 = -2$?\n\n    No, the equality does not hold.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Since the z-component of the total angular momentum is not conserved between the initial state ($m=-1$) and the desired final state ($m_{l1}+m_{l2}=-2$), it is impossible to obtain this measurement result. The probability of this outcome is exactly zero.\n\nThe probability is given by the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>$. This coefficient is zero because the selection rule $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$ is violated.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nMy apologies, there was a syntax error in the previous code attempt. The error arose from using incorrect parameter names for the `CG` function in the `sympy` library. However, the physical reasoning remains the same and is sufficient to solve the problem without needing a code-based calculation.\n\nHere is the corrected reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the System's State:** The initial state of the two-electron system is given in the coupled basis as $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n    *   $l=2$ is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number.\n    *   $m=-1$ is the quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum. This means the eigenvalue of the total z-component operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, is $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Measurement:** A measurement of the individual z-components of angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, is performed.\n\n3.  **Identify the Desired Outcome:** We want to find the joint probability of getting the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$ for *both* $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_{l1} = -1$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_{l2} = -1$.\n\n4.  **Apply the Conservation Law:** A fundamental principle in the addition of angular momentum is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. This is expressed in terms of the quantum numbers as:\n    $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$\n\n5.  **Check for Consistency:**\n    *   From the initial state, we know the total magnetic quantum number must be $m = -1$.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers would be $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The initial state is an eigenstate of the total z-component of angular momentum $L_z$ with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$. This means that any measurement of the individual components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ must yield eigenvalues whose corresponding quantum numbers ($m_{l1}$ and $m_{l2}$) sum to -1. Since the desired outcome has components that sum to -2, it violates this conservation rule. Therefore, the event is impossible, and its probability is 0.\n\nFormally, the state $|l=2, m=-1>$ can be written as a linear combination of the uncoupled states $|m_{l1}, m_{l2}>$. This expansion only includes terms where $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -1$. The state we are interested in, $|m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1>$, has a sum of -2 and is therefore not part of the expansion. This means the two states are orthogonal, and the probability of transitioning from one to the other upon measurement is zero.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nTo determine the joint probability, we must analyze the initial and final states of the two-electron system in terms of their angular momentum quantum numbers.\n\n### Analysis of the System State\n\n1.  **Initial State**: The system is in a coupled angular momentum state represented by the ket `|l₁, l₂, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>`.\n    *   `l₁ = 1`: Orbital angular momentum quantum number of the first electron (since it's in a p orbital).\n    *   `l₂ = 1`: Orbital angular momentum quantum number of the second electron (also in a p orbital).\n    *   `l = 2`: The total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the system.\n    *   `m = -1`: The z-component of the total orbital angular momentum.\n\n2.  **Measurement and Final State**: A measurement of the individual z-components of orbital angular momentum, `L₁z` and `L₂z`, is performed.

The state `|2, -1>` is an eigenstate of the operator `L_z` with a corresponding eigenvalue of `mħ = -1ħ`.\n\n### Measurement and Conservation\n\nWhen a measurement of the individual components `L_1z` and `L_2z` is performed, the system collapses into a state where these quantities are well-defined. The eigenvalues of `L_1z` and `L_2z` are `m_1ħ` and `m_2ħ`, respectively.\n\nA fundamental principle of quantum mechanics is that the sum of the measured individual components must equal the total value for the system. Therefore, the measured quantum numbers `m_1` and `m_2` must satisfy the condition:\n`m_1 + m_2 = m`\n\nIn this specific case, `m = -1`, so any measurement of `m_1` and `m_2` must result in `m_1 + m_2 = -1`.\n\n### The Question\n\nThe question asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalue of `L_1z` as `-ħ` and the eigenvalue of `L_2z` as `-ħ`. This corresponds to the outcome:\n*   `m_1 = -1`\n*   `m_2 = -1`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIf we check the sum of these desired outcomes, we get `m_1 + m_2 = -1 + (-1) = -2`.\n\nThis result (`-2`) contradicts the known state of the system, where the total magnetic quantum number `m` is `-1`. Because the measurement outcome `m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1` would violate the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum for the given state, this outcome is impossible.\n\nThe probability of an impossible event is zero. This can also be seen by expressing the coupled state `|2, -1>` in terms of the uncoupled basis states `|m_1, m_2>`. The expansion would only contain terms where `m_1 + m_2 = -1` (specifically, a superposition of `|m_1=0, m_2=-1>` and `|m_1=-1, m_2=0>`). The state `|m_1=-1, m_2=-1>` is not a component of the `|2, -1>` state, and thus the probability of measuring it is zero.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the initial state and the measurement:**\n    *   The initial state of the two-electron system is given in the coupled angular momentum basis as $|\\psi> = |l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n    *   In this state, the total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$, and the quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum is $m=-1$.

The initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$ is an eigenstate of the total z-component operator $L_z$ with eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. The measurement outcome state $|1, -1; 1, -1>$ is also an eigenstate of $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$ with eigenvalue $(m_1+m_2)\\hbar = (-1-1)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$. Since these two states are eigenstates of the same Hermitian operator ($L_z$) with different eigenvalues ($-\\hbar$ and $-2\\hbar$), they must be orthogonal. The probability of measuring the system in a state orthogonal to its initial state is zero.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nThe problem asks for the joint probability of measuring the z-component of orbital angular momentum for two electrons to both be `-ħ`, given that the 2-electron system is in a specific coupled angular momentum state.\n\n### Analysis of the State and Measurement\n\n1.  **System:** The system consists of two electrons, each in a p-orbital. For a p-orbital, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is `l = 1`.\n2.  **Individual Particle States (Uncoupled Basis):**\n    *   For electron 1: `l₁ = 1`. The possible z-component quantum numbers are `m₁ = -1, 0, 1`.\n    *   For electron 2: `l₂ = 1`. The possible z-component quantum numbers are `m₂ = -1, 0, 1`.\n    *   The states in the uncoupled basis are denoted by `|l₁, m₁; l₂, m₂>`, or simply `|m₁, m₂>` since `l₁` and `l₂` are fixed at 1.\n3.  **Coupled State:** The system is in the state `|l, m> = |2, -1>`. This is an eigenstate of the total angular momentum operator `L²` (with `l=2`) and the total z-component of angular momentum operator `L_z` (with `m=-1`).\n4.  **The Measurement:** A measurement of the individual z-components of angular momentum, `L₁z` and `L₂z`, is performed.\n5.  **Desired Outcome:** We want to find the probability of getting an eigenvalue of `-ħ` for `L₁z` **and** `-ħ` for `L₂z`.\n    *   An eigenvalue of `-ħ` for `L₁z` corresponds to the state where `m₁ = -1`.\n    *   An eigenvalue of `-ħ` for `L₂z` corresponds to the state where `m₂ = -1`.\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for the probability of finding the system in the uncoupled state `|m₁, m₂> = |-1, -1>`.\n\n### The Fundamental Principle (Selection Rule)\n\nThe connection between the coupled basis `|l, m>` and the uncoupled basis `|l₁, m₁; l₂, m₂>` is governed by the rules of angular momentum addition, using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n\nA fundamental principle, or selection rule, for the addition of angular momentum is that the total z-component quantum number `m` must be the sum of the individual z-component quantum numbers `m₁` and `m₂`.\n\n> `m = m₁ + m₂`\n\nThis rule arises because the operator for the total z-component of angular momentum `L_z` is simply the sum of the individual operators: `L_z = L₁z + L₂z`. The state `|l, m>` is an eigenstate of `L_z` with eigenvalue `mħ`. The state `|l₁, m₁; l₂, m₂>` is also an eigenstate of `L_z`, and its eigenvalue is `(m₁ + m₂)ħ`. For the coupled state to have any component of a particular uncoupled state, their `L_z` eigenvalues must be the same, which means `m` must equal `m₁ + m₂`.\n\n### Applying the Principle to the Problem\n\n*   The system is in the coupled state `|l=2, m=-1>`. So, `m = -1`.\n*   The measurement outcome we are interested in corresponds to the uncoupled state where `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1`.\n*   For this outcome, the sum is `m₁ + m₂ = -1 + (-1) = -2`.\n\nWe compare the total `m` of the system with the sum required for the desired outcome:\n*   `m` of the system = -1\n*   `m₁ + m₂` of the desired measurement = -2\n\nSince `m ≠ m₁ + m₂` (`-1 ≠ -2`), the selection rule is violated. This means that the coupled state `|2, -1>` has no component of the uncoupled state `|-1, -1>`.\n\nThe probability of measuring `m₁` and `m₂` is given by the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, `|<l₁, m₁; l₂, m₂ | l, m>|²`. Because the selection rule `m = m₁ + m₂` is not satisfied, this coefficient is zero.\n\nTherefore, the probability of measuring `L₁z = -ħ` and `L₂z = -ħ` is 0.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Quantum Numbers:**\n    *   The initial state is a coupled angular momentum state $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n    *   The total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n    *   The measurement is for the individual z-components of angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n    *   The desired eigenvalue for both is $-\\hbar$.

Therefore, the desired measurement outcome corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum numbers $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n\n2.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum:**\n    *   A fundamental principle in the addition of angular momentum is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the z-components of the individual angular momenta: $\\hat{L}_z = \\hat{L}_{1z} + \\hat{L}_{2z}$.\n    *   This implies a strict selection rule for the corresponding magnetic quantum numbers: $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n    *   Any combination of $m_1$ and $m_2$ that does not sum to the total $m$ is a physically impossible outcome for a system in the state $|l, m>$.

This state is given in the $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle$ notation as $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   $l_1 = 1$: Orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 1 (p orbital).\n    *   $l_2 = 1$: Orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 2 (p orbital).\n    *   $l = 2$: Total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the system.\n    *   $m = -1$: The z-component of the total orbital angular momentum quantum number.\n\n2.  **Identify the Measurement and Desired Outcome:**\n    A measurement is performed on the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum for each electron, which are represented by the operators $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n    *   The desired outcome for electron 1 is an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for the operator $L_{1z}$.\n    *   The desired outcome for electron 2 is an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for the operator $L_{2z}$.\n\n3.  **Translate the Measurement Outcome into Quantum States:**\n    The eigenvalues of the $L_z$ operator are given by $m\\hbar$, where $m$ is the magnetic quantum number.\n    *   For the measurement of $L_{1z}$ to yield $-\\hbar$, the magnetic quantum number for electron 1 must be $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   For the measurement of $L_{2z}$ to yield $-\\hbar$, the magnetic quantum number for electron 2 must be $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for the probability of finding the system in the uncoupled state defined by $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Apply the Rules of Angular Momentum Addition:**\n    A fundamental principle when coupling angular momenta is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components.\n    *   Total operator: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$\n    *   Relationship between quantum numbers: $m = m_1 + m_2$\n    This relationship is a **selection rule**. It means that a coupled state $|l, m\\rangle$ can only be composed of uncoupled states $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$ for which the condition $m = m_1 + m_2$ is satisfied. If this condition is not met, the uncoupled state has no contribution to the coupled state, and the probability of measuring it is zero.\n\n5.  **Check the Selection Rule for this Specific Case:**\n    *   From the initial coupled state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, we have the total magnetic quantum number $m = -1$.\n    *   From the desired measurement outcome, we have the individual magnetic quantum numbers $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   Let's check if the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is satisfied:\n        $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$\n    *   We compare this sum to the total magnetic quantum number of the initial state:\n        $-2 \\neq -1$\n\n6.  **Determine the Probability:**\n    The probability of measuring the system in the state $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$ when it is initially in the state $|l, m\\rangle$ is given by the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient: $P = |\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle|^2$.\n    *   Because the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is not satisfied for our case, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle$ is necessarily zero.\n    *   Therefore, the probability of obtaining this measurement outcome is $P = 0^2 = 0$.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Coupled vs. Uncoupled Basis:** The problem starts in the coupled basis ($|l, m\\rangle$) and asks about a measurement outcome described in the uncoupled basis ($|m_1, m_2\\rangle$). The connection between them is the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n*   **The $m = m_1 + m_2$ Selection Rule:** This is the most crucial point. It allows solving the problem instantly without calculating any specific Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. It's a consequence of the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum during the coupling process.\n*   **Eigenvalues and Quantum Numbers:** Be careful to correctly translate the given eigenvalue ($-\\hbar$) into the corresponding magnetic quantum number ($m = -1$).\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\nThe initial state of the system is $|l, m\\rangle = |2, -1\\rangle$, so the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\nThe measurement asks for the joint probability of finding the individual magnetic quantum numbers to be $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\nThe sum of these individual quantum numbers is $m_1 + m_2 = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\nAccording to the rules of angular momentum addition, a coupled state with total magnetic quantum number $m$ can only be a superposition of uncoupled states where $m_1 + m_2 = m$.\nIn this case, $m = -1$ and the sum $m_1 + m_2 = -2$. Since $-1 \\neq -2$, the state corresponding to the desired measurement outcome is not a component of the initial state.\nTherefore, the probability of measuring this outcome is zero.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the initial and final states.**\n    *   The initial state of the two-electron system is given in the coupled basis as $|\\psi_{initial}> = |l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$. Here, $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for the two electrons (since they are in p-orbitals). The total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$, and its z-component quantum number is $m=-1$.\n    *   A measurement of the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, is performed. This means we are projecting the initial state onto the uncoupled basis, which consists of states of the form $|l_1, m_1>|l_2, m_2>$.\n    *   We want to find the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$ for both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The eigenvalue of $L_z$ is $m\\hbar$. So, an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ corresponds to a magnetic quantum number of -1.\n    *   The final state corresponding to this measurement outcome is $| \\psi_{final} > = |l_1, m_1> |l_2, m_2> = |1, -1>|1, -1>$.\n\n2.  **Understand the relationship between the coupled and uncoupled bases.**\n    *   The total z-component of the angular momentum, $L_z$, is the sum of the individual z-components: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n    *   This implies that the corresponding quantum numbers are also related by a sum: $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n    *   The initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$ is an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator with an eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n    *   The final state $|1, -1>|1, -1>$ is an eigenstate of both $L_{1z}$ (with eigenvalue $m_1\\hbar = -1\\hbar$) and $L_{2z}$ (with eigenvalue $m_2\\hbar = -1\\hbar$). For this state, the total z-component of angular momentum eigenvalue is $(m_1+m_2)\\hbar = (-1 + -1)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$.\n\n3.  **Apply the conservation principle (selection rule).**\n    *   When we express a coupled state $|l, m>$ as a linear combination of uncoupled states $|m_1, m_2>$, only the uncoupled states for which the condition $m_1 + m_2 = m$ is met will have non-zero coefficients. These coefficients are known as Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n    *   In other words, a measurement of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ on a system in a state with a definite total magnetic quantum number $m$ can only yield outcomes $(m_1, m_2)$ that satisfy $m_1 + m_2 = m$. This is a consequence of the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n    *   In our case, the initial state has $m = -1$. The desired final measurement corresponds to $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   Let's check the condition: $m_1 + m_2 = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   Since $m_1 + m_2 = -2$ and $m = -1$, we have $-2 \\neq -1$.

This is expressed as a selection rule for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which are the coefficients used to expand the coupled state in terms of the uncoupled states. The coefficient $<j_1, m_1; j_2, m_2 | j, m>$ is zero unless $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n\n*   **Initial State:** The system is in the state $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$. This is a coupled state.

The desired measurement outcome corresponds to a state with a total z-component quantum number of $m_{total} = -2$.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The probability of measuring an outcome is given by the square of the amplitude of the projection of the initial state onto the final state. Because the initial state is an eigenstate of the total z-component operator $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$ with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$, and the measured state is an eigenstate of the same operator with a different eigenvalue ($-2\\hbar$), the states are orthogonal. Their inner product is zero. Therefore, the probability of this measurement is zero.\n\nThe reasoning holds. The answer must be D.\nFinal Answer Check:\nInitial state: $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$. This state is an eigenstate of $L_z = L_{1z}+L_{2z}$ with eigenvalue $-\\hbar$.\nMeasurement is made of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\nWe want the probability of getting eigenvalues $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ and $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$. This corresponds to the final uncoupled state $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1\\rangle$.\nFor this final state, the value of the total z-component of angular momentum is $m_{1} + m_{2} = -1 + (-1) = -2$. The eigenvalue of $L_z$ for this state is $-2\\hbar$.\nSince the initial state and the final state are eigenstates of the same operator ($L_z$) but with different eigenvalues ($-\\hbar$ and $-2\\hbar$), they are orthogonal.\nThe probability is the squared magnitude of the inner product of the initial and final states: $P = |\\langle m_1=-1, m_2=-1 | l=2, m=-1\\rangle|^2$.\nBecause the states are orthogonal, this inner product is zero.\nSo, the probability is 0.\nThe answer is D.\n\nFinal verification:\nThe expansion of $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$ in terms of $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$ is:\n$|2, -1\\rangle = \\sum_{m_1, m_2} \\langle 1, m_1; 1, m_2 | 2, -1 \\rangle |m_1, m_2\\rangle$.\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficients $\\langle 1, m_1; 1, m_2 | 2, -1 \\rangle$ are non-zero only if $m_1+m_2 = -1$.\nThe state we are interested in is $|-1, -1\\rangle$. For this state, $m_1+m_2 = -2$.\nTherefore, the coefficient $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle$ is zero.\nThe probability is the square of this coefficient, which is 0.\nThe logic is sound.In quantum mechanics, when adding two angular momenta, the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components.

For a p-orbital, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is `l=1`. Thus, we have `l₁ = 1` for the first electron and `l₂ = 1` for the second.\n2.  **Possible z-components:** The magnetic quantum number `m` can take integer values from `-l` to `+l`. For each electron, the possible values for their magnetic quantum numbers (`m₁` and `m₂`) are -1, 0, and +1. The corresponding eigenvalues of the z-component of angular momentum (`L₁z` and `L₂z`) are `mħ`, i.e., -ħ, 0, and ħ.\n3.  **Coupled State:** The two-electron system is in a coupled angular momentum state represented by `|l, m> = |2, -1>`. Here, `l=2` is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number, and `m=-1` is the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum quantum number.\n4.  **Conservation of Angular Momentum:** A fundamental principle of angular momentum addition is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. In terms of quantum numbers, this is expressed as:\n    `m = m₁ + m₂`\n\n### The Measurement\n\nThe question asks for the joint probability of measuring `L₁z = -ħ` and `L₂z = -ħ`. This corresponds to finding the system in a state where `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1`.\n\nLet's check if this measurement outcome is consistent with the given state of the system. According to the conservation rule, if we were to find `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1`, the total magnetic quantum number `m` would have to be:\n\n`m = m₁ + m₂ = (-1) + (-1) = -2`\n\nHowever, the system is explicitly stated to be in the state `|l, m> = |2, -1>`, which means its total magnetic quantum number is `m = -1`.\n\nSince the required measurement (`m₁ = -1`, `m₂ = -1`) would result in a total `m` of -2, which contradicts the system's actual state where `m = -1`, this measurement outcome is physically impossible.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe state `|l=2, m=-1>` is a superposition of states `|l₁, m₁>|l₂, m₂>` for which the condition `m₁ + m₂ = -1` is satisfied. The state corresponding to the measurement `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1` is `|l₁=1, m₁=-1>|l₂=1, m₂=-1>`. This state has a total `m` of -2 and is therefore orthogonal to the given state `|l=2, m=-1>`.\n\nThe probability of measuring an outcome that is inconsistent with the initial state of the system is zero.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nThe initial state of the two-electron system is given by the coupled angular momentum state $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. In this notation:\n*   $l_1 = 1$ is the orbital angular momentum quantum number of the first electron.\n*   $l_2 = 1$ is the orbital angular momentum quantum number of the second electron.\n*   $l = 2$ is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the system.\n*   $m = -1$ is the quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum.\n\nThe measurement is of the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The question asks for the joint probability of obtaining the eigenvalues of both operators to be $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to a final state where the magnetic quantum numbers for the individual electrons are $m_{l1} = -1$ and $m_{l2} = -1$.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, the coupled state $|l, m\\rangle$ is a linear superposition of the uncoupled states $|m_{l1}, m_{l2}\\rangle$. A fundamental principle of angular momentum coupling is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. That is, for any component in the superposition, the following condition must hold:\n$m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$\n\nIn this problem, the initial state has a total magnetic quantum number $m = -1$. The desired final measurement outcome is for $m_{l1} = -1$ and $m_{l2} = -1$. Let's check if this outcome is consistent with the initial state's total z-component of angular momentum:\nSum of the z-components of the desired outcome = $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n\nSince the sum of the individual z-components (-2) does not equal the total z-component of the initial state (-1), this particular outcome is physically impossible. The state $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the total angular momentum operator in the z-direction, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with an eigenvalue of $-1\\hbar$. The state corresponding to the measurement outcome, $|m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1\\rangle$, is also an eigenstate of $L_z$, but with an eigenvalue of $(-1 + -1)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$.\n\nBecause these two states are eigenstates of the same Hermitian operator ($L_z$) with different eigenvalues, they are orthogonal. The probability of measuring the initial state to be in this final state is given by the square of the magnitude of their inner product. Since the states are orthogonal, their inner product is zero.\n\nProbability = $|\\langle m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1 | l=2, m=-1 \\rangle|^2 = 0^2 = 0$.\n\nTherefore, the joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$ is 0.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the Initial State:** The system consists of two electrons, each in a p-orbital. For a p-orbital, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=1$.\n    *   Electron 1: $l_1 = 1$. The possible magnetic quantum numbers are $m_1 \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   Electron 2: $l_2 = 1$. The possible magnetic quantum numbers are $m_2 \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    The system is in a specific coupled angular momentum state, denoted by $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n    *   $l_1 = 1$ is the orbital quantum number for electron 1.\n    *   $l_2 = 1$ is the orbital quantum number for electron 2.\n    *   $l = 2$ is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the two-electron system.\n    *   $m = -1$ is the total magnetic quantum number, which is the projection of the total orbital angular momentum onto the z-axis.\n\n2.  **Understand the Measurement:** A measurement of the individual orbital angular momentum components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ is performed.\n    *   The operator $L_{1z}$ acts on electron 1, and its eigenvalues are $m_1\\hbar$.\n    *   The operator $L_{2z}$ acts on electron 2, and its eigenvalues are $m_2\\hbar$.\n    We are asked for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ as $-\\hbar$ and the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ corresponds to finding electron 1 in the state with $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ corresponds to finding electron 2 in the state with $m_2 = -1$.\n    So, we need to find the probability of observing the outcome $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, -1)$.\n\n3.  **Apply Fundamental Principles:** The key principle here is the relationship between the total magnetic quantum number ($m$) and the individual magnetic quantum numbers ($m_1$, $m_2$). The operator for the total z-component of angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-component operators:\n    $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$\n    The coupled state $|l, m>$ is an eigenstate of $L_z$ with eigenvalue $m\\hbar$. The uncoupled states $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2>$ (often written as $|m_1, m_2>$ for brevity when $l_1, l_2$ are known) are eigenstates of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ with eigenvalues $m_1\\hbar$ and $m_2\\hbar$ respectively.\n    When acting on an uncoupled state, the $L_z$ operator gives:\n    $L_z |m_1, m_2> = (L_{1z} + L_{2z})|m_1, m_2> = (m_1\\hbar + m_2\\hbar)|m_1, m_2> = (m_1+m_2)\\hbar|m_1, m_2>$\n    The coupled state $|l, m>$ can be expressed as a linear combination of the uncoupled states $|m_1, m_2>$:\n    $|l, m> = \\sum_{m_1, m_2} C_{m_1, m_2} |m_1, m_2>$\n    where the coefficients $C_{m_1, m_2}$ are the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n    For this expansion to be valid, applying $L_z$ to both sides must yield the same result.\n    $L_z|l, m> = m\\hbar|l, m> = m\\hbar \\sum_{m_1, m_2} C_{m_1, m_2} |m_1, m_2>$\n    $L_z \\left(\\sum_{m_1, m_2} C_{m_1, m_2} |m_1, m_2>\\right) = \\sum_{m_1, m_2} C_{m_1, m_2} (L_z|m_1, m_2>) = \\sum_{m_1, m_2} C_{m_1, m_2} (m_1+m_2)\\hbar |m_1, m_2>$\n    Comparing the two expressions, we see that for any term in the sum with a non-zero coefficient $C_{m_1, m_2}$, it must be that:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n    This is a fundamental selection rule for the addition of angular momenta.\n\n4.  **Solve the Specific Problem:**\n    *   The system is in the state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$, so the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n    *   We are looking for the probability of the measurement outcome $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, -1)$.\n    *   Let's check if this outcome is consistent with the selection rule: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=-1$, but the desired final state has a combined $m_1+m_2 = -2$.\n    *   Since $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$ (i.e., $-1 \\neq -2$), the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for this component, $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>$, is zero.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Probability:** The probability of measuring a specific outcome $(m_1, m_2)$ is the square of the magnitude of the coefficient of the corresponding state $|m_1, m_2>$ in the expansion of the system's state vector.\n    Probability $P(m_1=-1, m_2=-1) = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>|^2$\n    Since the coefficient is 0, the probability is $0^2 = 0$.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** It is impossible to measure the individual z-components of angular momentum to be $m_1=-1$ and $m_2=-1$ if the system is in a state with a total z-component of $m=-1$. The sum of the parts must equal the whole. Therefore, the joint probability is 0.\n\n(Optional) **Verification using Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients:**\nThe expansion of the state $|l=2, m=-1>$ in the uncoupled basis $|m_1, m_2>$ is given by:\n$|2, -1> = \\sum_{m_1+m_2=-1} <1, m_1; 1, m_2 | 2, -1> |m_1, m_2>$\nThe only possible pairs $(m_1, m_2)$ that sum to -1 are $(0, -1)$ and $(-1, 0)$.\nThe actual expansion is:\n$|2, -1> = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}|1, 0; 1, -1> + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}|1, -1; 1, 0>$\nAs we can see from this expansion, the state $|1, -1; 1, -1>$ is not a component of the state $|2, -1>$. Its coefficient is zero. Thus, the probability of measuring the system in this state is 0.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the initial state of the system.**\n    The system consists of two electrons, and its coupled orbital angular momentum state is given as $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   $l_1 = 1$: Orbital angular momentum quantum number of the first electron.\n    *   $l_2 = 1$: Orbital angular momentum quantum number of the second electron.\n    *   $l = 2$: Total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the two-electron system.\n    *   $m = -1$: The magnetic quantum number corresponding to the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum ($L_z$).\n\n    This state is an eigenstate of the total angular momentum squared operator, $L^2$, and the z-component of the total angular momentum operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. The eigenvalue of $L_z$ for this state is $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the measurement and the desired outcome.**\n    A measurement of the individual orbital angular momentum components, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, is performed.\n    We want to find the joint probability of the following outcome:\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This means the first electron is found in a state with magnetic quantum number $m_{l1} = -1$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This means the second electron is found in a state with magnetic quantum number $m_{l2} = -1$.\n\n3.  **Represent the measurement outcome as a state.**\n    The state corresponding to the measurement outcome is an eigenstate of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. This state is described in the uncoupled basis as $|l_1, m_{l1}\\rangle |l_2, m_{l2}\\rangle$.\n    For the desired outcome, this state is $|1, -1\\rangle |1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Apply the principle of conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.**\n    The initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the total z-component operator $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$ with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$.\n    The final state after measurement, $|1, -1\\rangle |1, -1\\rangle$, is also an eigenstate of $L_z$. Let's find its eigenvalue:\n    $L_z (|1, -1\\rangle |1, -1\\rangle) = (L_{1z} + L_{2z}) (|1, -1\\rangle |1, -1\\rangle)$\n    $= (L_{1z}|1, -1\\rangle)|1, -1\\rangle + |1, -1\\rangle(L_{2z}|1, -1\\rangle)$\n    $= (-1\\hbar |1, -1\\rangle)|1, -1\\rangle + |1, -1\\rangle(-1\\hbar |1, -1\\rangle)$\n    $= (-1\\hbar - 1\\hbar) |1, -1\\rangle |1, -1\\rangle$\n    $= -2\\hbar |1, -1\\rangle |1, -1\\rangle$\n    So, the final measured state has a total magnetic quantum number $m_{final} = m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the probability.**\n    The probability of obtaining a specific measurement outcome is given by the square of the magnitude of the inner product (or projection) of the initial state onto the final state.\n    Let $|\\Psi_{initial}\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$ and $|\\Psi_{final}\\rangle = |1, -1\\rangle |1, -1\\rangle$.\n    The probability is $P = |\\langle \\Psi_{final} | \\Psi_{initial} \\rangle|^2$.\n\n    We have established that $|\\Psi_{initial}\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of $L_z$ with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$, and $|\\Psi_{final}\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the same operator $L_z$ with eigenvalue $-2\\hbar$.\n    A fundamental theorem in quantum mechanics states that eigenstates of a Hermitian operator (like $L_z$) corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal.\n    Since the eigenvalues $-1\\hbar$ and $-2\\hbar$ are different, the states $|\\Psi_{initial}\\rangle$ and $|\\Psi_{final}\\rangle$ must be orthogonal.\n    Therefore, their inner product is zero:\n    $\\langle \\Psi_{final} | \\Psi_{initial} \\rangle = 0$.\n\n    The probability is then:\n    $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\n    This can also be understood using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The initial state can be expanded in the uncoupled basis:\n    $|l, m\\rangle = \\sum_{m_{l1}, m_{l2}} \\langle l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2} | l, m\\rangle |l_1, m_{l1}\\rangle |l_2, m_{l2}\\rangle$\n    The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2} | l, m\\rangle$ is non-zero only if the selection rule $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$ is satisfied.\n    In our case, $l=2, m=-1$, and we are interested in the component where $m_{l1}=-1$ and $m_{l2}=-1$.\n    The sum is $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n    Since $m = -1 \\neq -2$, the corresponding Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero. The probability, which is the square of this coefficient, is also zero. It is impossible to obtain this measurement result because it would violate the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:** The system is in the coupled angular momentum state $|\\psi_{initial}\\rangle = |l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the individual electrons.\n    *   $l = 2$ is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the system.\n    *   $m = -1$ is the magnetic quantum number for the z-component of the *total* angular momentum. This is a key piece of information. It means the system is in an eigenstate of the total angular momentum z-component operator, $\\hat{L}_z$, and a measurement of this quantity will *always* yield the eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Final State of the Measurement:** We want to find the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both $\\hat{L}_{1z}$ and $\\hat{L}_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$.\n    *   A measurement of $\\hat{L}_{1z}$ yielding $-\\hbar$ corresponds to the first electron having a magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   A measurement of $\\hat{L}_{2z}$ yielding $-\\hbar$ corresponds to the second electron having a magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   This measurement outcome corresponds to projecting the initial state onto the uncoupled basis state $|\\psi_{final}\\rangle = |l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Probability Calculation:** In quantum mechanics, the probability ($P$) of finding a system that is in an initial state $|\\psi_{initial}\\rangle$ to be in a final state $|\\psi_{final}\\rangle$ upon measurement is the square of the magnitude of their inner product:\n    $P = |\\langle \\psi_{final} | \\psi_{initial} \\rangle|^2$\n    For this problem, this becomes:\n    $P = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$\n\n4.  **Apply the Selection Rule for Angular Momentum Addition:** The operator for the total z-component of angular momentum is the sum of the individual operators: $\\hat{L}_z = \\hat{L}_{1z} + \\hat{L}_{2z}$. This physical relationship imposes a strict constraint on the corresponding quantum numbers. The inner product $\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle$, known as a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, is non-zero *only if* the following selection rule is satisfied:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n\n5.  **Check the Selection Rule:**\n    *   From the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, we have the total magnetic quantum number $m = -1$.\n    *   From the desired final state $|1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$, we have the individual magnetic quantum numbers $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   Now, let's check if the rule holds:\n        $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$\n    *   Comparing the required total $m$ with the sum of the individual parts:\n        $-1 \\neq -2$\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Since the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is not satisfied, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero.\n    $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle = 0$\n    Therefore, the probability is:\n    $P = |0|^2 = 0$\n\nThe physical interpretation is straightforward: the initial state has a definite total z-angular momentum of $-1\\hbar$. The measurement outcome we are testing for corresponds to a state with a total z-angular momentum of $(-1\\hbar) + (-1\\hbar) = -2\\hbar$. A system cannot be found to have a property (total $L_z = -2\\hbar$) that is different from the definite value it possesses (total $L_z = -1\\hbar$).

This means a measurement of the total z-component of angular momentum, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, will yield the eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Understand the Measurement and Final State:** We are measuring the individual z-components of orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. We want to find the probability of getting the specific outcome where:\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the magnetic quantum number for electron 1 being $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the magnetic quantum number for electron 2 being $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   This desired final state is an uncoupled state, represented by the ket $|l_1, l_2, m_1, m_2\\rangle = |1, 1, -1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Principles of Quantum Mechanics:** The probability of obtaining this specific measurement outcome is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between the final state and the initial state.\n    *   Probability $P = |\\langle \\text{final state} | \\text{initial state} \\rangle|^2$.\n    *   $P = |\\langle 1, 1, -1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$.\n\n4.  **Use the Conservation of Angular Momentum:** The term $\\langle 1, 1, -1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle$ is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, which describes the transformation between the coupled and uncoupled bases. A fundamental rule for the addition of angular momentum is that the z-component is conserved. This means that the total z-component quantum number ($m$) must equal the sum of the individual z-component quantum numbers ($m_1 + m_2$).\n    *   From the initial state, we have $m = -1$.\n    *   From the desired final state, we have $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   Let's check the conservation rule: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** We see that $m = -1$ while $m_1 + m_2 = -2$. Since $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$, the conservation rule is violated. Therefore, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero.\n    *   $\\langle 1, 1, -1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle = 0$.\n    *   The probability is $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\nThis outcome is physically required. The initial state is an eigenstate of the total z-angular momentum operator $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$ with eigenvalue $-\\hbar$. Any measurement of the individual components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ must yield results that sum to this total value. The desired outcome, with eigenvalues $-\\hbar$ and $-\\hbar$, sums to $-2\\hbar$.

This corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum numbers being `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1`.\n\nThe two-electron system is in a coupled angular momentum state represented by `|l₁, l₂, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>`. In this state:\n*   `l₁ = 1` and `l₂ = 1` are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for the two electrons (since they are in p-orbitals).\n*   `l = 2` is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the system.\n*   `m = -1` is the total magnetic quantum number, which corresponds to the z-component of the total angular momentum.\n\nA fundamental principle of angular momentum coupling in quantum mechanics is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the z-components of the individual angular momenta. This relationship also holds for their respective quantum numbers:\n\n`m = m₁ + m₂`\n\nIn this specific case, the system is in a state where the total magnetic quantum number `m` is -1. Therefore, any measurement of the individual magnetic quantum numbers `m₁` and `m₂` must result in values that sum to -1.\n\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific measurement outcome where `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1`. For this outcome, the sum would be:\n\n`m₁ + m₂ = -1 + (-1) = -2`\n\nThis result (`-2`) contradicts the known state of the system, where `m = -1`. Because this measurement outcome would violate the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum, it is a physically impossible event.\n\nThe probability of measuring an outcome that is inconsistent with the conservation laws of the system is zero. This can also be seen by considering the expansion of the coupled state into the uncoupled basis states using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The coefficient `<l₁, m₁, l₂, m₂ | l, m>` is only non-zero if `m = m₁ + m₂`. Since `-1 ≠ -1 + (-1)`, the corresponding Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero, and thus the probability, which is the square of this coefficient, is also zero.\n\nTherefore, the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both `L₁z` and `L₂z` as `-ħ` is 0.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nThe problem asks for the joint probability of measuring specific eigenvalues for the z-component of the orbital angular momentum for two electrons.\n\n1.  **Initial State:** The two-electron system is in a coupled angular momentum state `|l, m> = |2, -1>`. This means the total orbital angular momentum quantum number is `l=2`, and the quantum number for its z-component is `m=-1`.\n2.  **Individual Particles:** The electrons are in a p-orbital, so their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are `l₁=1` and `l₂=1`.\n3.  **Measurement:** A measurement of the individual z-components of orbital angular momentum, `L₁z` and `L₂z`, is performed.\n4.  **Desired Outcome:** We want to find the probability of measuring the eigenvalue `-ħ` for *both* `L₁z` and `L₂z`. This corresponds to the measurement outcome where the individual magnetic quantum numbers are `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1`.\n\nThe z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. This is true for both the operators (`L_z = L₁z + L₂z`) and their corresponding quantum numbers (`m = m₁ + m₂`).\n\nIn the initial state, the system has a definite total magnetic quantum number `m = -1`. This means that any measurement of the total z-component of angular momentum will yield `-1ħ`. Consequently, if we measure the individual components `L₁z` and `L₂z`, the sum of their outcomes `m₁` and `m₂` must equal the total `m`.\n\nSo, the condition `m₁ + m₂ = -1` must be satisfied.\n\nThe question asks for the probability of the outcome `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1`. Let's check if this outcome is possible:\n`m₁ + m₂ = (-1) + (-1) = -2`\n\nSince the required sum `(-2)` does not equal the system's total magnetic quantum number `(-1)`, this outcome is physically impossible. The state `|l=2, m=-1>` has no component corresponding to the state where `m₁=-1` and `m₂=-1`. The probability of measuring an impossible outcome is zero.\n\nTo be more formal, the probability `P` is the square of the absolute value of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient that connects the initial and final states:\nP = |<l₁, m₁; l₂, m₂ | l, m>|²\nP = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>|²\n\nClebsch-Gordan coefficients are zero unless `m = m₁ + m₂`. Here, `m = -1` and `m₁ + m₂ = -2`. Since `-1 ≠ -2`, the coefficient is zero, and the probability is zero.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nTo determine the joint probability, we must analyze the composition of the initial coupled state in terms of the uncoupled states of the individual electrons.\n\n### Key Principles\n1.  **Initial State**: The system is in a coupled angular momentum state denoted by `|l, m>`, where `l` is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number and `m` is the magnetic quantum number for the z-component of the total angular momentum. Here, the state is `|2, -1>`.\n2.  **Measurement State**: The measurement seeks to find the system in a state where the individual z-component eigenvalues are `-ħ` for both electrons. This corresponds to the uncoupled state `|m1, m2> = |-1, -1>`.\n3.  **Conservation of Angular Momentum**: A fundamental principle in the addition of angular momenta is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. That is, `m = m1 + m2`. This rule is a consequence of the properties of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which relate the coupled and uncoupled bases.\n\n### Analysis\nThe initial state of the 2-electron system is `|l, m> = |2, -1>`. This means the quantum number for the z-component of the total angular momentum is `m = -1`.\n\nThe measurement is for the outcome where `L1z` gives an eigenvalue of `-ħ` (so `m1 = -1`) and `L2z` gives an eigenvalue of `-ħ` (so `m2 = -1`).\n\nAccording to the rules of angular momentum addition, the z-component of the total angular momentum must be conserved. Therefore, for any possible outcome of `m1` and `m2`, their sum must equal the initial total `m`.\n\nLet's check if the desired outcome is possible:\n*   `m1 = -1`\n*   `m2 = -1`\n*   `m1 + m2 = -1 + (-1) = -2`\n\nThe initial state has `m = -1`, while the desired final state has a total `m` of -2. Since `-1 ≠ -2`, this outcome is not physically possible. The system, being in a state with a total `m` of -1, cannot be found in a configuration where the sum of the individual `m` values is -2.\n\nThe probability of measuring an outcome is given by the square of the amplitude of that outcome's state in the expansion of the initial state. This amplitude is represented by a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. The coefficient `<l1, m1; l2, m2 | l, m>` is zero unless `m = m1 + m2`. In this case, `<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>` is zero because `-1 + (-1) ≠ -1`.\n\nTherefore, the probability of finding the system with `m1 = -1` and `m2 = -1` is zero.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:**\n    The system of two electrons is in the coupled angular momentum state $|\\psi\\rangle = |l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    In this state, the total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$, and the quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum is $m=-1$. The state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the total z-component operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Measurement and Desired Outcome:**\n    A measurement of the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, is performed.\n    We want to find the joint probability of obtaining the following results:\n    *   For the first electron, the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   For the second electron, the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n\n3.  **Identify the Final State:**\n    The state corresponding to this specific measurement outcome is the uncoupled state $|\\phi\\rangle = |l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum:**\n    The total angular momentum operators are related to the individual ones by $\\vec{L} = \\vec{L}_1 + \\vec{L}_2$. For the z-components, this means $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. This relationship also holds for the corresponding quantum numbers: $m = m_1 + m_2$. This is a fundamental selection rule in the coupling of angular momenta.\n\n5.  **Check for Consistency:**\n    *   For the initial state $|\\psi\\rangle$, we have $m = -1$.\n    *   For the desired final state $|\\phi\\rangle$, we would have a total z-component quantum number of $m' = m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n    Since the total z-component of the initial state ($m=-1$) is different from the total z-component of the desired final state ($m'=-2$), the measurement outcome is impossible.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Probability:**\n    The probability of finding the system, initially in state $|\\psi\\rangle$, in the final state $|\\phi\\rangle$ after a measurement is given by the square of the inner product of the two states:\n    $P = |\\langle \\phi | \\psi \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$.\n\n    The term $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle$ is known as a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. A key property (the selection rule mentioned above) of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients $\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle$ is that they are zero unless $m_1 + m_2 = m$.\n\n    In our case, $m_1=-1$, $m_2=-1$, and $m=-1$. Since $m_1 + m_2 = -2 \\neq m = -1$, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero.\n    $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle = 0$.\n\n    Therefore, the probability is:\n    $P = 0^2 = 0$.\n\nAlternatively, we can reason that the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the operator $L_z$ with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$. The state corresponding to the measurement outcome, $|1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$, is an eigenstate of the same operator $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$ with eigenvalue $(-1-1)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$. Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal. Thus, their inner product is zero, and the probability of measuring one state given the other is zero.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nTo determine the joint probability, we must express the coupled angular momentum state $|l, m\\rangle$ in terms of the uncoupled states $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle$. This relationship is defined by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n\nThe given coupled state is $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\nHere:\n*   $l_1 = 1$ (orbital angular momentum quantum number for electron 1)\n*   $l_2 = 1$ (orbital angular momentum quantum number for electron 2)\n*   $l = 2$ (total orbital angular momentum quantum number)\n*   $m = -1$ (the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum)\n\nWe want to measure the z-components of the individual angular momenta, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The measurement we are interested in is when both electrons yield an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$.\n*   For $L_{1z}$, an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n*   For $L_{2z}$, an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n\nThe probability of finding the system in the state $|m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1\\rangle$ upon measurement is the square of the absolute value of the projection of the initial state onto the final state:\n$P(m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1) = |\\langle l_1=1, m_1=-1; l_2=1, m_2=-1 | l=2, m=-1 \\rangle|^2$\n\nThe term $\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle$ is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. A fundamental selection rule for these coefficients is that they are non-zero only if the magnetic quantum numbers sum correctly:\n$m = m_1 + m_2$\n\nLet's check this condition for our specific case:\n*   The total magnetic quantum number of the initial state is $m = -1$.\n*   The sum of the magnetic quantum numbers for the desired measurement outcome is $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\nSince $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$ (as $-1 \\neq -2$), the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero.\n$\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle = 0$\n\nThis means that the state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$ is orthogonal to the state $|1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$. The state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$ is actually a superposition of states where $m_1+m_2 = -1$, specifically the states $|m_1=0, m_2=-1\\rangle$ and $|m_1=-1, m_2=0\\rangle$. It has no component along the $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1\\rangle$ direction.\n\nTherefore, the probability of measuring $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$ simultaneously is:\n$P = |0|^2 = 0$\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nMy plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  Identify the quantum numbers of the initial state of the two-electron system. The state is given as $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. So, we have $l_1=1$, $l_2=1$, $l=2$, and $m=-1$.\n2.  Identify the quantum numbers of the final state we are measuring. A measurement of the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$ for the z-component of angular momentum ($L_z$) corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_z = -1$. We want this outcome for both electrons, so the final state has $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n3.  Apply the fundamental conservation rule for the coupling of angular momentum. The total magnetic quantum number $m$ must be the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers, i.e., $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n4.  Check if this condition is met. The initial state has $m=-1$. The state we are measuring has a total magnetic quantum number of $m_1 + m_2 = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n5.  Since the total $m$ of the initial state (-1) is not equal to the sum of the individual $m$ values of the final state (-2), the transition is forbidden. In the language of quantum mechanics, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for this transformation, $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle$, is zero.\n6.  The probability is the square of the magnitude of this coefficient, which is $0^2 = 0$.\n7.

The eigenvalue of $L_z$ is $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Measurement and Desired Outcome:**\n    A measurement of the individual z-components of orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, is performed.\n    *   The desired outcome is that the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the magnetic quantum number for electron 1 being $m_{l1} = -1$.\n    *   The desired outcome is that the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the magnetic quantum number for electron 2 being $m_{l2} = -1$.\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for the probability of finding the system in the uncoupled state $|l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2}> = |1, -1; 1, -1>$.\n\n3.  **Method 1: Conservation of the Z-component of Angular Momentum (Quick Method)**\n    *   The operator for the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-component operators: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n    *   Similarly, the corresponding quantum numbers are related by the sum: $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$.\n    *   In the initial state, the system has a well-defined total magnetic quantum number $m = -1$.\n    *   The desired final state has individual magnetic quantum numbers $m_{l1} = -1$ and $m_{l2} = -1$.\n    *   For this final state, the total magnetic quantum number would be $m_{final} = m_{l1} + m_{l2} = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   A measurement of the components ($L_{1z}, L_{2z}$) cannot change the total z-component of the system's angular momentum. The initial state is an eigenstate of $L_z$ with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$, meaning any measurement result must be consistent with this value.\n    *   Since the initial total magnetic quantum number ($m_{initial} = -1$) is different from the total magnetic quantum number of the desired outcome ($m_{final} = -2$), it is impossible to obtain this outcome.\n    *   Therefore, the probability of this measurement outcome is 0.\n\n4.  **Method 2: Using Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients (Formal Method)**\n    *   To find the probability, we must express the initial coupled state $|l, m> = |2, -1>$ as a linear combination of the uncoupled basis states $|m_{l1}, m_{l2}>$. The probability of measuring the outcome $|-1, -1>$ is the square of the magnitude of its coefficient in this expansion.\n    *   The general expansion is:\n        $|l, m> = \\sum_{m_{l1}, m_{l2}} <l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2} | l, m> |l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2}>$\n        where the sum is over all $m_{l1}$ and $m_{l2}$ such that $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = m$.\n    *   For our case, $l_1=1$, $l_2=1$, $l=2$, and $m=-1$. We need to find the pairs $(m_{l1}, m_{l2})$ such that $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -1$. The possible pairs are:\n        *   $(m_{l1}, m_{l2}) = (0, -1)$\n        *   $(m_{l1}, m_{l2}) = (-1, 0)$\n    *   The expansion of the state $|2, -1>$ is therefore:\n        $|2, -1> = <1, 0; 1, -1|2, -1> |1, 0; 1, -1> + <1, -1; 1, 0|2, -1> |1, -1; 1, 0>$\n    *   From a table of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for coupling $j_1=1$ and $j_2=1$, we find:\n        *   $<1, 0; 1, -1|2, -1> = 1/\\sqrt{2}$\n        *   $<1, -1; 1, 0|2, -1> = 1/\\sqrt{2}$\n    *   So, the initial state is:\n        $|1, 1, 2, -1> = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} |1, 0; 1, -1> + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} |1, -1; 1, 0>$\n    *   We want to find the probability of measuring the outcome corresponding to the state $|1, -1; 1, -1>$.\n    *   The probability is given by the square of the amplitude (inner product):\n        $P = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | \\psi_{initial}>|^2$\n        $P = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} |1, 0; 1, -1> + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} |1, -1; 1, 0> \\right) |^2$\n    *   The uncoupled basis states are orthogonal. This means $<m'_{l1}, m'_{l2} | m_{l1}, m_{l2}> = \\delta_{m'_{l1}, m_{l1}} \\delta_{m'_{l2}, m_{l2}}$.\n    *   Therefore:\n        *   $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 0; 1, -1> = 0$\n        *   $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, -1; 1, 0> = 0$\n    *   The inner product is 0, and the probability $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth methods show that the probability of measuring $m_{l1}=-1$ and $m_{l2}=-1$ from the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$ is zero. This is because the desired outcome is inconsistent with the conservation of the z-component of the total angular momentum.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{0}$.\n**Reasoning:**\n1.  **Identify the states:**\n    *   The initial state of the system is given in the coupled basis as $|\\Psi_{initial}\\rangle = |l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   The measurement performed is of the individual z-components of orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n    *   We want to find the probability of obtaining the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$ for *both* $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{iz}$ corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_i = -1$.\n    *   Therefore, the final state we are projecting onto is the state where electron 1 has $m_1 = -1$ and electron 2 has $m_2 = -1$. In the uncoupled product basis, this state is $|\\Psi_{final}\\rangle = |l_1, m_1\\rangle |l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1\\rangle_1 |1, -1\\rangle_2$.\n\n2.  **Calculate the probability:**\n    *   According to the principles of quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring the system in the state $|\\Psi_{final}\\rangle$ when it was initially in $|\\Psi_{initial}\\rangle$ is given by the square of the absolute value of their inner product:\n        $P = |\\langle \\Psi_{final} | \\Psi_{initial} \\rangle|^2$.\n    *   Substituting the states, we have:\n        $P = |\\left( \\langle 1, -1 | \\langle 1, -1 | \\right) |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle|^2$.\n    *   This inner product, $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle$, is known as a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.\n\n3.  **Apply the selection rule:**\n    *   A fundamental rule in the addition of angular momenta is the conservation of the z-component. This translates to a selection rule for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients: the coefficient $\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle$ can only be non-zero if the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers equals the total magnetic quantum number.\n    *   **Selection Rule:** $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n    *   In our case:\n        *   From the final state, $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n        *   From the initial state, the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n    *   Let's check the rule: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   Since $m_1 + m_2 = -2$ is not equal to the system's total $m = -1$, the selection rule is violated.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Because the selection rule is not satisfied, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero.\n        $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle = 0$.\n    *   Therefore, the probability of this specific outcome is $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n    *   This result was confirmed by the python code execution, which also calculated the probability to be 0.

The key to solving this lies in the principles of angular momentum coupling in quantum mechanics.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1.  **Identify the system and state:**\n    *   We have two electrons in a p-orbital, which means their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are `l₁ = 1` and `l₂ = 1`.\n    *   The combined 2-electron system is in a coupled state represented by `|l, m⟩ = |2, -1⟩`, where `l=2` is the total angular momentum quantum number and `m=-1` is the magnetic quantum number for the total angular momentum.\n\n2.  **Identify the measurement:**\n    *   A measurement of the orbital angular momentum components `L₁z` and `L₂z` is performed.\n    *   We want to find the probability of obtaining the eigenvalue `-ħ` for *both* `L₁z` and `L₂z`.\n    *   The eigenvalue of the `Lz` operator is `mₗħ`. Therefore, an eigenvalue of `-ħ` corresponds to a magnetic quantum number `mₗ = -1`.\n    *   So, the question is asking for the probability of finding the system in a state where `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1`.\n\n3.  **Apply the rules of angular momentum addition:**\n    *   When angular momenta are coupled, the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the z-components of the individual angular momenta. This is expressed by the quantum number relationship: `m = m₁ + m₂`.\n    *   This relationship is a strict selection rule. The coupled state `|l, m⟩` is a superposition of the uncoupled states `|l₁, m₁; l₂, m₂⟩`. A specific uncoupled state can only contribute to the superposition if its magnetic quantum numbers satisfy `m₁ + m₂ = m`.\n\n4.  **Check for conservation:**\n    *   The given total state is `|l=2, m=-1⟩`, so the total magnetic quantum number is `m = -1`.\n    *   The desired measurement outcome is `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1`.\n    *   Let's check if the sum `m₁ + m₂` equals `m`:\n        *   `m₁ + m₂ = (-1) + (-1) = -2`\n    *   We see that `-2 ≠ -1`.\n\n5.  **Determine the probability:**\n    *   The probability of measuring a system in state `|ψ⟩` to be in a particular eigenstate `|φ⟩` is given by the square of the absolute value of the inner product, `|⟨φ|ψ⟩|²`.\n    *   In our case, we want the probability of finding the system in the state `|l₁, m₁; l₂, m₂⟩ = |1, -1; 1, -1⟩` when it is in the state `|l, m⟩ = |2, -1⟩`.\n    *   The probability is `|⟨1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1⟩|²`.\n    *   The term `⟨1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1⟩` is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. Because the condition `m = m₁ + m₂` is not met, this coefficient is zero.\n    *   Therefore, the probability is `0² = 0`.\n\nThere is a zero probability of measuring `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1` simultaneously because it would violate the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\n### Analysis of the Quantum State\n\nThe problem asks for the joint probability of measuring specific eigenvalues for the z-component of the orbital angular momentum of two electrons. The initial state of the two-electron system is a coupled angular momentum state.\n\nThe key principles to solve this problem are:\n1.  **Conservation of Angular Momentum:** When angular momenta are combined, the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components.\n2.  **State Decomposition:** A coupled angular momentum state can be expressed as a linear combination of uncoupled states. The coefficients in this expansion are known as Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n3.  **Probability in Quantum Mechanics:** The probability of measuring a system to be in a particular state is the square of the absolute value of the amplitude (or coefficient) of that state in the system's wavefunction.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1.  **Identify the Quantum Numbers:**\n    *   The two electrons are in a p-orbital, which means their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are `l₁ = 1` and `l₂ = 1`.\n    *   The coupled state of the system is given as `|l, m> = |2, -1>`, where `l=2` is the total angular momentum quantum number and `m=-1` is the magnetic quantum number for the total angular momentum.\n\n2.  **Define the Measurement:**\n    *   A measurement of the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum, `L₁z` and `L₂z`, is performed.\n    *   We are interested in the probability of finding the eigenvalue of `L₁z` to be `-ħ` and the eigenvalue of `L₂z` to be `-ħ`. These eigenvalues correspond to the magnetic quantum numbers `m₁ = -1` for the first electron and `m₂ = -1` for the second electron.\n\n3.  **Apply the Selection Rule:**\n    *   A fundamental rule for the addition of angular momenta is that the magnetic quantum number of the total angular momentum (`m`) must equal the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers (`m₁` and `m₂`). This is often expressed as `m = m₁ + m₂`.\n    *   In the state we want to measure, `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1`.\n    *   The sum is `m₁ + m₂ = (-1) + (-1) = -2`.\n    *   The given total state of the system is `|l=2, m=-1>`, so the total magnetic quantum number is `m = -1`.\n\n4.  **Determine the Probability:**\n    *   The state we are measuring (`m₁ = -1`, `m₂ = -1`) has a total magnetic quantum number of `m = -2`. However, the system is in a state where the total magnetic quantum number is `m = -1`.\n    *   The probability of measuring a particular outcome (`m₁`, `m₂`) is given by the squared magnitude of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient `<l₁, m₁, l₂, m₂ | l, m>`.\n    *   Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are zero unless the selection rule `m = m₁ + m₂` is satisfied.\n    *   In this case, since `m₁ + m₂ = -2` and `m = -1`, the condition is not met.\n    *   Therefore, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient `<1, -1, 1, -1 | 2, -1>` is zero.\n    *   The joint probability is the square of this coefficient, which is `0² = 0`.\n\nThe state `|l=2, m=-1>` is a superposition of states where `m₁ + m₂ = -1`. Specifically, it is a combination of the states `|m₁=0, m₂=-1>` and `|m₁=-1, m₂=0>`. The state `|m₁=-1, m₂=-1>` is not a component of the initial state, and thus the probability of measuring it is zero.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nThe key to solving this problem lies in the conservation of the z-component of the total angular momentum.\n\nThe initial state of the two-electron system is given in the coupled representation as `|l, m> = |2, -1>`. In this state:\n*   `l` is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number.\n*   `m` is the quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum (`L_z`).\n\nA fundamental principle of quantum mechanics is that a measurement of an observable on a system in an eigenstate of that observable will always yield the corresponding eigenvalue. Here, the system is in an eigenstate of the total angular momentum z-component operator, `L_z = L_1z + L_2z`, with the eigenvalue `mħ = -1ħ`.\n\nThe problem asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of `L_1z` and `L_2z` to both be `-ħ`. This corresponds to finding the individual quantum numbers `m_1 = -1` and `m_2 = -1`.\n\nIf this measurement outcome were to occur, the z-component of the total angular momentum of the system would be the sum of the individual components:\n`m = m_1 + m_2 = -1 + (-1) = -2`.\n\nThis creates a contradiction. The initial state has a definite total angular momentum z-component corresponding to `m = -1`. The measurement outcome being considered corresponds to a total angular momentum z-component of `m = -2`. Since the z-component of angular momentum must be conserved during the measurement process, it is impossible to start in a state with `m=-1` and find the system in a state with `m=-2`.\n\nAnother way to see this is by using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The coupled state `|l, m>` can be expressed as a linear combination of the uncoupled states `|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2>`. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are the coefficients of this expansion. A crucial selection rule for these coefficients is that they are non-zero only if `m = m_1 + m_2`.\n\nWe are looking for the probability of finding the system in the state `|m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1>`. This probability is the square of the magnitude of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient `<l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m>`, which is `<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>`.\n\nSince `m_1 + m_2 = -2` and `m = -1`, the condition `m = m_1 + m_2` is not met. Therefore, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero, and the probability is zero.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nThe problem asks for the probability of a specific measurement outcome on a quantum system in a given state.\n\n1.  **Initial State**: The system of two electrons is in the coupled angular momentum state $|\\psi_{initial}\\rangle = |l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. This is an eigenstate of the total angular momentum operators $\\hat{L}^2$ and $\\hat{L}_z$. The eigenvalue of the total z-component of angular momentum, $\\hat{L}_z = \\hat{L}_{1z} + \\hat{L}_{2z}$, for this state is $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Measurement Outcome State**: We want to measure the individual z-components of angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The specific outcome we are interested in is getting eigenvalues of $-\\hbar$ for both. This corresponds to the uncoupled state $|\\psi_{final}\\rangle = |l_1, m_1, l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1, 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Probability Calculation**: In quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring a system in state $|\\psi_{initial}\\rangle$ to be in the state $|\\psi_{final}\\rangle$ is given by the square of the magnitude of their inner product:\n    $P = |\\langle \\psi_{final} | \\psi_{initial} \\rangle|^2$\n\n    Substituting the specific states:\n    $P = |\\langle 1, 1, -1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$\n\n4.  **Applying Selection Rules (Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients)**: The inner product $\\langle l_1, m_1, l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle$ is known as a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. A fundamental selection rule for these coefficients is that they are non-zero only if the z-components of angular momentum are conserved, meaning **$m = m_1 + m_2$**.\n\n5.  **Checking the Condition**:\n    *   From the initial state, the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n    *   From the desired final state, the individual magnetic quantum numbers are $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   The sum is $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n6.  **Conclusion**: Since $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$ (because $-1 \\neq -2$), the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero.\n    $\\langle 1, 1, -1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle = 0$\n\n    Therefore, the probability is:\n    $P = 0^2 = 0$\n\nThis means it is impossible to obtain the measurement outcome where both electrons have a z-component of angular momentum of $-\\hbar$ if the total system has a z-component of angular momentum of $-1\\hbar$.\n\nThe provided code output confirms this reasoning. The calculated Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is 0, which leads to a probability of 0.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nThe user's question asks for the joint probability of measuring the z-components of orbital angular momentum for two electrons.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the initial state:** The system is in the coupled angular momentum state $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   $l_1 = 1$: Orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 1 (since it's in a p-orbital).\n    *   $l_2 = 1$: Orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 2 (also in a p-orbital).\n    *   $l = 2$: The total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the 2-electron system.\n    *   $m = -1$: The magnetic quantum number corresponding to the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum, $L_z$. The eigenvalue of $L_z$ for this state is $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the measured state:** We want to find the probability of a specific measurement outcome.\n    *   The measurement of $L_{1z}$ gives an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$. The operator for the z-component of angular momentum is $L_z$, and its eigenvalues are $m_l \\hbar$. Therefore, an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ corresponds to a magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   The measurement of $L_{2z}$ gives an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to a magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   So, we are asking for the probability of finding the system in the state where electron 1 has $m_1 = -1$ and electron 2 has $m_2 = -1$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum:** In quantum mechanics, when adding angular momenta, the z-component of the total angular momentum is simply the sum of the individual z-components.\n    *   Operator relation: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$\n    *   Quantum number relation: $m = m_1 + m_2$\n\n4.  **Check for Consistency:** A measurement of the individual components ($m_1, m_2$) is only possible if their sum equals the total magnetic quantum number ($m$) of the system's state.\n    *   From the initial state, we know the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers would be $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   Comparing these two values: The system's total $m$ is -1, but the sum of the measured components is -2.\n    *   Since $m_1 + m_2 \\neq m$ (i.e., $-2 \\neq -1$), this measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n\n5.  **Conclusion on Probability:** A measurement outcome that violates a conservation law is impossible. Therefore, the probability of observing this outcome is exactly zero.\n\n6.  **Formal Justification (Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients):**\n    The probability of finding the system, which is in the coupled state $|l, m\\rangle$, in the uncoupled state $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$ is given by the square of the corresponding Clebsch-Gordan coefficient:\n    $P(m_1, m_2) = |\\langle l_1, m_1, l_2, m_2 | l, m\\rangle|^2$.\n\n    For our problem, this is:\n    $P(m_1=-1, m_2=-1) = |\\langle 1, -1, 1, -1 | 2, -1\\rangle|^2$.\n\n    A fundamental property of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is that they are non-zero only if $m_1 + m_2 = m$. As we have shown, this condition is not met. Therefore, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero.\n\n    $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\nThe Python code execution in the scratchpad confirms this calculation, yielding a probability of 0.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Initial State**\n\nThe system is initially in a coupled angular momentum state given by $|\\Psi_{initial}\\rangle = |l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\nThis state is an eigenstate of the total z-component of the orbital angular momentum operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. The total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$. This means a measurement of the total z-component of angular momentum would yield the value $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$ with certainty.\n\n**2. Identify the State Corresponding to the Measurement Outcome**\n\nThe problem asks for the joint probability of measuring the individual z-components of angular momentum and getting specific eigenvalues:\n*   The eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$.\n*   The eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$.\n\nThis measurement outcome is represented by a state in the uncoupled basis: $|\\Psi_{final}\\rangle = |l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n**3. Apply the Law of Conservation of Angular Momentum**\n\nA fundamental rule for the addition of angular momenta is that the total magnetic quantum number must be the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers:\n$m = m_1 + m_2$\n\nLet's check this rule for our scenario:\n*   From the initial state, the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n*   From the final measurement state, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\nSince $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$ (because $-1 \\neq -2$), the transition from the initial state to this final state is forbidden by the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n\n**4. Calculate the Probability**\n\nThe probability of finding the system in the state $|\\Psi_{final}\\rangle$ upon measurement is given by the square of the magnitude of the inner product of the initial and final states:\n$P = |\\langle \\Psi_{final} | \\Psi_{initial} \\rangle|^2$\n\nThe inner product $\\langle \\Psi_{final} | \\Psi_{initial} \\rangle$ is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle$. The selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ dictates that this coefficient is zero.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider that $|\\Psi_{initial}\\rangle$ and $|\\Psi_{final}\\rangle$ are both eigenstates of the same operator $L_z$ but with different eigenvalues ($-1\\hbar$ and $-2\\hbar$, respectively). Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator corresponding to different eigenvalues are always orthogonal. Therefore, their inner product is zero.\n\n$\\langle \\Psi_{final} | \\Psi_{initial} \\rangle = 0$\n\nThus, the probability is:\n$P = |0|^2 = 0$\n\nIt is impossible to find the system in a state with a total z-component of angular momentum of $-2\\hbar$ when it started in a state with a total z-component of $-1\\hbar$.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nThe code execution returned `0`, which confirms the reasoning.\n\nThe problem asks for the probability of measuring the z-components of the individual orbital angular momenta, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, to both be $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to finding the system in the uncoupled state $|m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1\\rangle$.\n\nThe system is initially in the coupled state $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$. The key principle in coupling angular momenta is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. This is expressed by the selection rule for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients: the coefficient $\\langle l_1, m_1, l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle$ is non-zero only if $m_1 + m_2 = m$.\n\nIn this specific case:\n*   The total magnetic quantum number of the initial state is $m = -1$.\n*   The magnetic quantum numbers of the desired final state are $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n*   The sum of the final magnetic quantum numbers is $m_1 + m_2 = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n\nSince $m_1 + m_2 = -2$ and $m = -1$, the condition $m_1 + m_2 = m$ is not met. Therefore, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient that connects these states is zero. The probability, which is the square of the magnitude of this coefficient, is also zero.\n\nPhysically, this means it is impossible for a system with a total z-component of angular momentum of $-1\\hbar$ to be measured and found to have a total z-component of $-2\\hbar$. Conservation of the z-component of angular momentum forbids this outcome.\n\nThe Python code confirmed this by explicitly calculating the relevant Clebsch-Gordan coefficient and showing the resulting probability is 0.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nTo determine the joint probability, we must analyze the initial and final states of the two-electron system.\n\n**1. Understand the Initial State:**\nThe system is initially in a coupled angular momentum state described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n*   $l_1 = 1$ is the orbital angular momentum quantum number of the first electron.\n*   $l_2 = 1$ is the orbital angular momentum quantum number of the second electron.\n*   $l = 2$ is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the system.\n*   $m = -1$ is the total magnetic quantum number, which corresponds to the z-component of the total angular momentum ($L_z$).\n\n**2. Understand the Measurement and Final State:**\nA measurement of the z-components of the individual angular momenta, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, is performed. We want to find the probability of obtaining the following specific outcomes:\n*   For the first electron ($L_{1z}$), the eigenvalue is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_{l1} = -1$.\n*   For the second electron ($L_{2z}$), the eigenvalue is also $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_{l2} = -1$.\n\nThis final measured state is described in the uncoupled basis as $|l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2}> = |1, -1; 1, -1>$.\n\n**3. Apply the Conservation of the Z-Component of Angular Momentum:**\nA fundamental principle in quantum mechanics is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the z-components of the individual angular momenta. This is expressed in terms of the magnetic quantum numbers as:\n$m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$\n\nIn the initial state of the system, the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\nFor the desired measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers would be:\n$m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -1 + (-1) = -2$\n\nSince the total magnetic quantum number of the initial state (m = -1) does not equal the sum of the magnetic quantum numbers of the measured state (-2), this measurement outcome violates the law of conservation of angular momentum.\n\n**4. Calculate the Probability:**\nThe probability of measuring a certain outcome is given by the square of the magnitude of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, which connects the coupled state to the uncoupled state. Specifically, the probability is $|<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>|^2$.\n\nBecause the condition $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$ is not met, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for this transition is zero. This means that the expansion of the coupled state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$ into the uncoupled basis does not contain the term $|1, -1; 1, -1>$. The only terms present in the expansion must satisfy $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -1$, which are combinations like $|1, 0; 1, -1>$ and $|1, -1; 1, 0>$.\n\nTherefore, the probability of obtaining a measurement where $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ both have eigenvalues of $-\\hbar$ is zero.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nThe problem asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both the z-component of the orbital angular momentum of electron 1 ($L_{1z}$) and electron 2 ($L_{2z}$) to be $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to finding the probability that a measurement will yield the quantum numbers $m_{l1} = -1$ and $m_{l2} = -1$.\n\nThe two-electron system is in a coupled angular momentum state described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1,1, 2, -1>$. In this state, the total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$, and the quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum is $m=-1$.\n\nThe total z-component of the angular momentum is the sum of the individual components: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. A fundamental principle of quantum mechanics is that if a system is in an eigenstate of an operator, any measurement of the corresponding observable will yield the eigenvalue of that state. In this case, the system is in an eigenstate of the total angular momentum z-component operator, $L_z$, with a well-defined eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\nWhen a joint measurement of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ is performed, the sum of the outcomes must equal the total z-component of the angular momentum. The eigenvalues of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ are given by $m_{l1}\\hbar$ and $m_{l2}\\hbar$, respectively. Therefore, any measurement must satisfy the condition $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = m = -1$.\n\nThe question asks for the probability of the outcome where $m_{l1} = -1$ and $m_{l2} = -1$. For this specific outcome, the sum of the z-component quantum numbers would be $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n\nSince this resulting total z-component ($m=-2$) is different from the system's well-defined total z-component ($m=-1$), this outcome violates the conservation of angular momentum. Therefore, the probability of observing this outcome is zero.\n\nTo confirm this with a formal calculation, one can express the coupled state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$ in the uncoupled basis $|m_{l1}, m_{l2}>$ using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\nThe expansion is:\n$|1, 1, 2, -1> = <1, 0; 1, -1|2, -1>|1, 0; 1, -1> + <1, -1; 1, 0|2, -1>|1, -1; 1, 0>$\nUsing a standard table of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, both coefficients are $\\sqrt{1/2}$:\n$|1, 1, 2, -1> = \\sqrt{1/2}|1, 0; 1, -1> + \\sqrt{1/2}|1, -1; 1, 0>$\n\nThe probability of finding the system in the state with $m_{l1}=-1$ and $m_{l2}=-1$ (denoted as $|1, -1; 1, -1>$) is the square of the magnitude of the projection of the system's state onto this target state:\n$P(m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1) = |<1, -1; 1, -1| (|1, 1, 2, -1>)|^2$\n$P = |<1, -1; 1, -1| (\\sqrt{1/2}|1, 0; 1, -1> + \\sqrt{1/2}|1, -1; 1, 0>)|^2$\n\nDue to the orthonormality of the basis vectors, the inner product $<1, -1; 1, -1|1, 0; 1, -1>$ is 0, and the inner product $<1, -1; 1, -1|1, -1; 1, 0>$ is also 0. Thus, the entire expression evaluates to 0, and the probability is $0^2=0$.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nThe problem asks for the joint probability of measuring the z-components of orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, for two electrons and finding the specific eigenvalues of $-\\hbar$ for both.\n\n### 1. Define the System and the States\n\n*   **Individual Electrons:** The two electrons are in a *p* orbital, which means their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$.\n*   **Individual Magnetic Quantum Numbers ($m_l$):** For an electron with $l=1$, the possible magnetic quantum numbers ($m_l$) are -1, 0, and +1. These correspond to the eigenvalues of the $L_z$ operator, which are $m_l\\hbar$.\n*   **Initial Coupled State:** The two-electron system is in a specific coupled state given by $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$. Here, $l=2$ is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number, and $m=-1$ is the total magnetic quantum number.\n*   **Measurement Outcome State:** We want to find the probability of measuring $L_{1z} = -\\hbar$ and $L_{2z} = -\\hbar$. This corresponds to finding the first electron in the state with $m_1 = -1$ and the second electron in the state with $m_2 = -1$. This uncoupled product state is written as $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1\\rangle$.\n\n### 2. The Principle of Angular Momentum Conservation\n\nA fundamental principle in the coupling of angular momenta is the conservation of the z-component. The total magnetic quantum number, $m$, of a coupled state must be equal to the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers, $m_1$ and $m_2$, of the uncoupled states that compose it.\n\nMathematically, this is expressed as:\n$m = m_1 + m_2$\n\n### 3. Applying the Principle to the Problem\n\n*   The initial state of the system has a total magnetic quantum number $m = -1$.\n*   The measurement outcome we are interested in has individual magnetic quantum numbers $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n*   Let's check if this outcome is consistent with the conservation principle:\n    $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$\n\nSince the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers (-2) is not equal to the total magnetic quantum number of the system's state (-1), this outcome is forbidden by the law of conservation of angular momentum.\n\n### 4. Conclusion from Quantum Theory\n\nIn quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring a particular outcome is found by projecting the initial state onto the desired final state. The probability is the square of the magnitude of this projection. The coefficients for this projection are known as Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n\nThe probability P is given by:\n$P = |\\langle m_1=-1, m_2=-1 | l=2, m=-1 \\rangle|^2$\n\nThe term $\\langle m_1=-1, m_2=-1 | l=2, m=-1 \\rangle$ is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. These coefficients are non-zero only if the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is satisfied.\n\nIn this case, since $-1 + (-1) \\neq -1$, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero. Therefore, the amplitude for this transition is zero, and the probability is also zero.\n\nThere is a zero probability of jointly measuring the z-component of angular momentum for the two electrons to be $-\\hbar$ each, because such an outcome would violate the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
