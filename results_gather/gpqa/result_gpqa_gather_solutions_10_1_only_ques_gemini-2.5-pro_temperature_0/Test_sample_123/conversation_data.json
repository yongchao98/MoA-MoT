The lifetime of the particle as measured in the lab frame, τ_lab, is dilated by the Lorentz factor, γ:\n    τ_lab = γ * τ\n\n3.  **Decay in the Lab Frame:** The decay law in the lab frame, as a function of lab time t_lab, is:\n    N(t_lab) = N₀ * exp(-t_lab / τ_lab) = N₀ * exp(-t_lab / (γ * τ))\n\n4.  **Time of Flight:** The particles are created at the center of the detector and travel a distance R = 30 m to the inner walls. Since they are ultra-relativistic, their speed v is approximately the speed of light, c. The time it takes for them to reach the detector in the lab frame is:\n    t_flight = R / v ≈ R / c\n\n5.  **Fraction of Surviving Particles:** The fraction of particles that reach the detector is the number of particles that have not decayed after the time of flight, divided by the initial number.\n    Fraction (F) = N(t_flight) / N₀ = exp(-t_flight / (γ * τ))\n    Substituting t_flight ≈ R/c, we get:\n    F = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))\n\n6.  **Set up Equations for Both Scenarios:**\n    Let the constant term `K = R / (c * τ)`. This value depends on the detector radius and the particle's proper lifetime, so it's the same in both scenarios. The equation becomes `F = exp(-K / γ)`.\n\n    *   **Scenario 1:**\n        Given: F₁ = 1/3, γ₁ = 20\n        1/3 = exp(-K / 20)\n\n    *   **Scenario 2:**\n        Given: F₂ = 2/3, γ₂ = ?\n        2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)\n\n7.  **Solve for γ₂:**\n    First, let's find the value of K from Scenario 1 by taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    ln(1/3) = -K / 20\n    -ln(3) = -K / 20\n    K = 20 * ln(3)\n\n    Now, take the natural logarithm of the equation for Scenario 2:\n    ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂\n\n    Substitute the value of K we just found:\n    ln(2/3) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂\n\n    We know that ln(2/3) = -ln(3/2). So:\n    -ln(3/2) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂\n\n    The negative signs cancel out:\n    ln(3/2) = (20 * ln(3)) / γ₂\n\n    Now, solve for γ₂:\n    γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)\n\n8.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    Using the approximate values for natural logarithms:\n    ln(3) ≈ 1.0986\n    ln(3/2) = ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055\n\n    γ₂ ≈ (20 * 1.0986) / 0.4055\n    γ₂ ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055\n    γ₂ ≈ 54.19\n\nThis value is approximately 54.

Understanding Relativistic Particle Decay\n\nThe fraction of unstable particles that survive after a certain time is governed by the principles of special relativity and exponential decay. Due to time dilation, a particle moving at a relativistic speed experiences time slower than an observer in a stationary reference frame (like the detector).\n\nThe formula for the fraction of surviving particles, `N/N₀`, is:\n\n`N/N₀ = exp(-t_lab / (γ * τ))`\n\nWhere:\n*   `N` is the number of particles that reach the detector.\n*   `N₀` is the initial number of particles.\n*   `t_lab` is the time taken to reach the detector wall in the lab's frame of reference.\n*   `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n*   `τ` (tau) is the mean lifetime of the particle in its own rest frame.\n\n### 2. Setting up the Equations\n\nThe particles are described as \"ultra-relativistic,\" meaning their velocity `v` is extremely close to the speed of light, `c`. The time it takes for them to travel the detector's radius `L` (30 m) is `t_lab = L / v ≈ L / c`.\n\nSo, the survival fraction formula can be written as:\n\n`N/N₀ = exp(-L / (γ * c * τ))`\n\nLet's define a constant `k = L / (c * τ)`, which depends on the detector radius and the particle's intrinsic properties. The equation simplifies to:\n\n`N/N₀ = exp(-k / γ)`\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n\n`ln(N/N₀) = -k / γ`\n`γ = -k / ln(N/N₀)`\n\n### 3. Using the Given Conditions\n\nWe have two scenarios:\n\n**Condition 1:**\n*   Lorentz factor, `γ₁` = 20\n*   Fraction of surviving particles, `(N/N₀)₁` = 1/3\n\n**Condition 2:**\n*   Lorentz factor, `γ₂` = ?\n*   Fraction of surviving particles, `(N/N₀)₂` = 2/3\n\nWe can set up a ratio to eliminate the unknown constant `k`:\n\n`γ₂ / γ₁ = [-k / ln((N/N₀)₂)] / [-k / ln((N/N₀)₁)]`\n`γ₂ / γ₁ = ln((N/N₀)₁) / ln((N/N₀)₂)`\n\nNow, we can solve for `γ₂`:\n\n`γ₂ = γ₁ * [ln(1/3) / ln(2/3)]`\n\n### 4. Calculation\n\nUsing the properties of logarithms (`ln(a/b) = ln(a) - ln(b)` and `ln(1/x) = -ln(x)`), we can simplify the expression:\n\n`γ₂ = 20 * [-ln(3) / (ln(2) - ln(3))]`\n`γ₂ = 20 * [ln(3) / (ln(3) - ln(2))]`\n\nNow, we use the known values for the natural logarithms of 2 and 3:\n*   ln(3) ≈ 1.0986\n*   ln(2) ≈ 0.6931\n\nPlugging these values into the equation:\n\n`γ₂ = 20 * [1.0986 / (1.0986 - 0.6931)]`\n`γ₂ = 20 * [1.0986 / 0.4055]`\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\nThis result is closest to 54.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:** The problem involves the exponential decay of particles and the time dilation effect from special relativity. The fraction of particles, `f`, that survive after a time `t` in the lab frame is given by `f = exp(-t / τ_lab)`, where `τ_lab` is the particle's lifetime in the lab frame.\n2.  **Apply Time Dilation:** The lifetime in the lab frame (`τ_lab`) is related to the particle's proper lifetime (`τ₀`, its lifetime in its own rest frame) by the Lorentz factor `γ`: `τ_lab = γ * τ₀`.\n3.  **Determine the Travel Time:** The particles are ultra-relativistic, so their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light, `c`. The time `t` it takes for them to travel the detector radius `R` is `t ≈ R / c`.\n4.  **Formulate the Core Equation:** By substituting the expressions for `t` and `τ_lab` into the decay formula, we get:\n    `f = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ₀)) = exp(-R / (c * γ * τ₀))`\n    The term `R / (c * τ₀)` is a constant for this specific particle and detector setup. Let's call this constant `K`. So, `f = exp(-K / γ)`.\n5.  **Use the Initial Condition:** We are given that when the Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`, the fraction of surviving particles is `f₁ = 1/3`. We can use this to find the constant `K`.\n    `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`.\n    This gives us `K = -20 * ln(1/3) = 20 * ln(3)`.\n6.  **Solve for the New Lorentz Factor:** We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`, for which the fraction of surviving particles is `f₂ = 2/3`.\n    `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n    Taking the natural logarithm: `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`.\n    Solving for `γ₂`: `γ₂ = -K / ln(2/3)`.\n7.  **Calculate the Final Value:** Now, substitute the value of `K` we found in step 5 into the equation from step 6.\n    `γ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / ln(2/3) = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`.\n8.  **Code the Calculation:** Write a Python script to compute this value and compare it to the given options.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# This problem can be solved by relating the fraction of particles reaching the detector\n# to the Lorentz factor and the particle's proper lifetime.\n\n# The fraction of particles 'f' that do not decay is given by f = exp(-t / τ_lab),\n# where t is the time in the lab frame and τ_lab is the dilated lifetime.\n# t = R / v ≈ R / c (since particles are ultra-relativistic)\n# τ_lab = γ * τ₀ (where γ is the Lorentz factor and τ₀ is the proper lifetime)\n# So, f = exp(-R / (c * γ * τ₀))\n\n# Let's define a constant C = R / (c * τ₀).

The number of particles, N, that have not decayed after a certain time is described by the exponential decay law. This law is most fundamentally expressed in the particle's own rest frame. The connection between the particle's rest frame and the laboratory frame (the detector) is made through the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Decay Equation:**\n    *   In the particle's rest frame, the number of particles remaining after a proper time `t'` is given by:\n        `N(t') = N₀ * exp(-t' / τ)`\n        where `N₀` is the initial number of particles and `τ` is the mean proper lifetime of the particle.\n    *   The fraction of particles that survive is `N/N₀ = exp(-t' / τ)`.\n\n3.  **Relate Lab Frame and Rest Frame (Time Dilation):**\n    *   The particles are created at the center of the detector and travel a distance `R` (the radius) to reach the inner wall.\n    *   In the lab frame, the time taken for this journey is `t_lab = R / v`, where `v` is the particle's velocity.\n    *   The problem states the particles are \"ultra-relativistic\", so we can approximate their velocity `v ≈ c` (the speed of light). Thus, `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n    *   Due to time dilation, the time elapsed in the lab frame (`t_lab`) is longer than the time elapsed in the particle's rest frame (`t'`). The relationship is given by the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n        `t_lab = γ * t'`\n    *   Therefore, the proper time experienced by the particle during its journey to the detector wall is:\n        `t' = t_lab / γ = (R / c) / γ = R / (γ * c)`\n\n4.  **Combine Decay and Relativity:**\n    *   Substitute the expression for the proper time `t'` into the survival fraction equation:\n        `N/N₀ = exp(-(R / (γ * c)) / τ) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n    *   The term `c*τ` is the mean distance a particle travels in its rest frame during its mean proper lifetime. This is a constant property of the particle. Let's call the constant `K = R / (c * τ)`. The equation simplifies to:\n        `N/N₀ = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n5.  **Use the Initial Condition to Find the Constant K:**\n    *   We are given that for a Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`, one third of the particles reach the detector.\n    *   `N₁/N₀ = 1/3`\n    *   Plugging these values into our equation:\n        `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n    *   To solve for `K`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n        `-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n        `K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n6.  **Solve for the New Lorentz Factor (γ₂):**\n    *   Now we need to find the Lorentz factor `γ₂` required for two thirds of the particles to reach the detector.\n    *   `N₂/N₀ = 2/3`\n    *   Using the same survival equation with the new values:\n        `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n    *   Take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`\n        `-ln(3/2) = -K / γ₂`\n        `ln(3/2) = K / γ₂`\n    *   Now, solve for `γ₂`:\n        `γ₂ = K / ln(3/2)`\n    *   Substitute the expression for `K` we found in the previous step:\n        `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    *   Using the approximate values for the natural logarithms: `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(3/2) = ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`.\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ (20 * 1.0986) / 0.4055`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2. This matches option A.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Distinguish Frames:** It is crucial to correctly distinguish between the proper time `t'` in the particle's rest frame and the observed time `t_lab` in the laboratory frame. The decay law exponent must use the proper time.\n*   **Ultra-relativistic Approximation:** The assumption `v ≈ c` is justified by the problem statement and simplifies the calculation of the lab-frame travel time.\n*   **Constant Property:** The mean proper lifetime `τ` (and thus the product `c*τ`) is an intrinsic property of the particle type and does not change when the particle's energy (and thus `γ`) changes.\n*   **Logical Check:** To have a larger fraction of particles survive (from 1/3 to 2/3), their internal clocks must run slower relative to the lab. This requires a larger time dilation effect, which means a higher Lorentz factor `γ`. Our result `γ₂ ≈ 54` is indeed greater than `γ₁ = 20`, which is consistent with the physics.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe problem involves the relativistic effect of time dilation on particle decay. The fraction of particles `N/N₀` that survive after a time `t` in the lab frame is given by the exponential decay law:\n\n`N/N₀ = exp(-t / τ_lab)`\n\nwhere `τ_lab` is the mean lifetime of the particle in the lab frame.\n\nDue to time dilation, the lifetime of a particle moving with a Lorentz factor `γ` is extended in the lab frame compared to its proper lifetime `τ_proper` (its lifetime in its own rest frame):\n\n`τ_lab = γ * τ_proper`\n\nThe time `t` it takes for the particles to travel the radius `R` of the detector at a velocity `v` is:\n\n`t = R / v`\n\nSince the particles are ultra-relativistic, their velocity `v` is very close to the speed of light `c`, so we can approximate `t ≈ R / c`.\n\nSubstituting these into the decay equation, we get the fraction of surviving particles as a function of the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n\n`N/N₀ = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ_proper)) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ_proper))`\n\nThe term `c * τ_proper` is a constant for a given type of particle, representing its mean decay length. Let's call the constant term `K = R / (c * τ_proper)`. The equation simplifies to:\n\n`N/N₀ = exp(-K / γ)`\n\nWe are given two scenarios:\n\n**Scenario 1:**\n*   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`\n*   Fraction surviving, `(N/N₀)₁ = 1/3`\n\nPlugging these values into the equation:\n`1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n`-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n`K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n*   Fraction surviving, `(N/N₀)₂ = 2/3`\n*   We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`.\n\nPlugging these values into the equation:\n`2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`\n`-ln(3/2) = -K / γ₂`\n`K = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\nNow we have two expressions for the constant `K`, so we can set them equal to each other:\n\n`20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\nFinally, we solve for `γ₂`:\n\n`γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\nUsing the provided code output for the calculation:\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\nThis value is closest to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo determine the required Lorentz factor, we can use the principles of special relativity applied to particle decay.\n\n### Analysis of the Physics\n\nThe number of particles, N, that survive after a time *t* in the laboratory frame is given by the exponential decay law:\n\nN = N₀ * exp(-t / τ_lab)\n\nWhere:\n*   **N₀** is the initial number of particles.\n*   **t** is the time elapsed in the laboratory frame.\n*   **τ_lab** is the average lifetime of the particles in the laboratory frame.\n\nDue to time dilation, the lifetime of a particle moving at a relativistic speed is longer in the lab frame than its proper lifetime (τ_proper), which is its lifetime in its own rest frame. The relationship is given by:\n\nτ_lab = γ * τ_proper\n\nwhere **γ** is the Lorentz factor.\n\nThe particles are created at the center of a spherical detector with a radius **R** of 30 meters.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution.\n\n### **1. Understand the Physics**\n\n*   **Particle Decay:** The number of particles `N` remaining from an initial sample `N₀` after a time `t` in the particle's own rest frame is given by the exponential decay law:\n    `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / τ)`\n    where `τ` is the proper mean lifetime of the particle.\n\n*   **Time Dilation:** Since the particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, their time appears to run slower from the perspective of the laboratory (the detector). The lifetime of the particle as measured in the lab frame (`t_lab_lifetime`) is dilated by the Lorentz factor, `γ`:\n    `t_lab_lifetime = γ * τ`\n\n*   **Survival Fraction:** A particle \"reaches the detector\" if it survives for the time it takes to travel the radius `R` of the detector. The time of flight in the lab frame (`t_travel`) is:\n    `t_travel = R / v`\n    Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity `v` is extremely close to the speed of light `c`. So, we can approximate `t_travel ≈ R / c`.\n\nThe fraction of particles that survive (`f`) is the ratio `N / N₀` after the time `t_travel`. Using the decay law in the lab frame:\n`f = N(t_travel) / N₀ = exp(-t_travel / t_lab_lifetime)`\n\nSubstituting the expressions for `t_travel` and `t_lab_lifetime`, we get the key formula:\n`f = exp(-(R/c) / (γτ))`\n\nLet's group the constants `R`, `c`, and `τ` into a single constant `K = R / (cτ)`, since these values do not change between the two scenarios. The formula simplifies to:\n`f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n### **2. Apply the Formula to Both Scenarios**\n\n**Scenario 1:**\n*   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`\n*   Fraction of survivors, `f₁ = 1/3`\n\nPlugging these values into our formula:\n`1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n\nTo solve for the constant `K`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n`-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n`K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n*   Fraction of survivors, `f₂ = 2/3`\n*   We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n`2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n\nAgain, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`\n`-ln(3/2) = -K / γ₂`\n`γ₂ = K / ln(3/2)`\n\n### **3. Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nNow we can substitute the expression for `K` we found in Scenario 1 into the equation for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)`\n\nUsing the property of logarithms `ln(a/b) = ln(a) - ln(b)`:\n`γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n\nCalculating the numerical value:\n*   `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986`\n*   `ln(2) ≈ 0.6931`\n*   `γ₂ ≈ (20 * 1.0986) / (1.0986 - 0.6931)`\n*   `γ₂ ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055`\n*   `γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\nThe calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2.

This law is expressed in terms of the particle's own time, known as the proper time (`t_p`). The formula is:\n        `f = N/N₀ = exp(-t_p / τ)`\n        where `τ` is the mean proper lifetime of the particle.\n\n    *   **Special Relativity (Time Dilation):** A particle moving at a relativistic speed experiences time more slowly than a stationary observer. The time measured in the lab's frame (`t_lab`) is related to the proper time (`t_p`) by the Lorentz factor (`γ`):\n        `t_lab = γ * t_p`\n        This means the time that passes for the particle is `t_p = t_lab / γ`.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Equations for the System:**\n    *   The particles travel a distance `R` (the detector radius) in the lab frame.\n    *   Since they are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`.\n    *   The time of flight in the lab frame is `t_lab = R / v ≈ R / c`.\n    *   Now, we can find the proper time experienced by the particle during its journey:\n        `t_p = t_lab / γ = (R / c) / γ = R / (γ * c)`\n    *   Substitute this expression for `t_p` into the decay formula to get the survival fraction `f` as a function of `γ`:\n        `f = exp(- (R / (γ * c)) / τ ) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n3.  **Set Up a Ratio for the Two Scenarios:**\n    *   Let's define a constant `K = R / (c * τ)`. This constant combines the detector's size and the particle's intrinsic lifetime, which do not change between the two scenarios. The survival equation simplifies to:\n        `f = exp(-K / γ)`\n    *   To solve for `γ`, we can first isolate the constant `K`. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives:\n        `ln(f) = -K / γ`\n        `K = -γ * ln(f)`\n    *   Since `K` is the same for both scenarios, we can set the expressions for `K` from each scenario equal to each other:\n        `-γ₁ * ln(f₁) = -γ₂ * ln(f₂)`\n\n4.  **Solve for the Unknown Lorentz Factor (`γ₂`):**\n    *   We are given:\n        *   Scenario 1: `γ₁ = 20`, `f₁ = 1/3`\n        *   Scenario 2: `γ₂ = ?`, `f₂ = 2/3`\n    *   Plug these values into the equation:\n        `-20 * ln(1/3) = -γ₂ * ln(2/3)`\n    *   The negative signs cancel out:\n        `20 * ln(1/3) = γ₂ * ln(2/3)`\n    *   Solve for `γ₂`:\n        `γ₂ = 20 * (ln(1/3) / ln(2/3))`\n    *   Using the logarithm properties `ln(1/x) = -ln(x)` and `ln(x/y) = ln(x) - ln(y)`:\n        `γ₂ = 20 * (-ln(3)) / (ln(2) - ln(3))`\n        `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n        `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    *   Now, we can compute the value of `γ₂` using a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# We derived the formula for the new Lorentz factor: gamma_2 = 20 * ln(3) / ln(1.5)\ngamma_2 = 20 * math.log(3) / math.log(1.5)\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\n<execute_code>\nimport math\n\n# We derived the formula for the new Lorentz factor: gamma_2 = 20 * ln(3) / ln(1.5)\ngamma_2 = 20 * math.log(3) / math.log(1.5)\nprint(gamma_2)\n</execute_code>\n<code_output>\n54.18839183013329\n</code_output>\nThe calculated value for the new Lorentz factor is approximately 54.19.

Physics Background**\n\n*   **Particle Decay:** The number of particles, N, that survive after a time t in their own rest frame is given by the exponential decay law: $N(t) = N_0 e^{-t/\\tau_0}$, where $N_0$ is the initial number of particles and $\\tau_0$ is the proper mean lifetime.\n*   **Time Dilation:** From the perspective of the laboratory (the detector), the lifetime of a fast-moving particle is dilated. The lab-frame lifetime, $\\tau_{lab}$, is related to the proper lifetime by the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$: $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n*   **Travel Time:** The particles are ultra-relativistic, meaning their speed $v$ is very close to the speed of light, $c$. The time it takes for a particle to travel the detector radius, $R$, in the lab frame is $t_{lab} \\approx R/c$.\n\n**2. Deriving the Formula**\n\nThe fraction of particles, $f$, that survive the journey to the detector wall is given by the decay law using the time and lifetime measured in the lab frame:\n$f = \\frac{N}{N_0} = e^{-t_{lab}/\\tau_{lab}}$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $t_{lab}$ and $\\tau_{lab}$:\n$f = e^{-(R/c) / (\\gamma \\tau_0)} = e^{-R / (c \\gamma \\tau_0)}$\n\nTo simplify, let's take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$\\ln(f) = -\\frac{R}{c \\gamma \\tau_0}$\n\nRearranging the equation gives:\n$\\gamma \\ln(f) = -\\frac{R}{c \\tau_0}$\n\nSince $R$, $c$, and $\\tau_0$ are constants for this experiment, the entire right side is a constant. This means the product $\\gamma \\ln(f)$ is constant. We can also write this as $\\gamma \\ln(1/f)$ being constant.\n\n**3.

This law must account for time dilation, where the particle's internal clock runs slower. The formula is:\n    `f = exp(-t / (γ * τ))`\n    where:\n    *   `t` is the time of flight in the detector's frame.\n    *   `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   `τ` (tau) is the proper mean lifetime of the particle (its lifetime in its own rest frame).\n\n2.  **Time of Flight**: The particles travel from the center to the wall of the spherical detector, a distance equal to the radius `R = 30 m`. Since they are moving at ultra-relativistic velocities, their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light, `c`. Therefore, the time of flight `t` is:\n    `t ≈ R / c = 30 / c`\n\n3.  **Setting up the Ratios**: Let's analyze the two scenarios given in the problem. The term `(R/c) / τ` is a constant for this specific particle and detector setup. Let's call this constant `K`. The survival equation becomes:\n    `f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n    *   **Scenario 1**: We are given that when the Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`, one-third of the particles survive, so `f₁ = 1/3`.\n        `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n\n    *   **Scenario 2**: We need to find the Lorentz factor `γ₂` for which two-thirds of the particles survive, so `f₂ = 2/3`.\n        `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n\n4.  **Solving for the Unknown**: We can solve for `γ₂` by first finding the constant `K` from Scenario 1.\n\n    *   From Scenario 1, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n        `-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n        `K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n    *   Now, substitute this expression for `K` into the equation for Scenario 2:\n        `ln(2/3) = - (20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n\n    *   Rearrange the equation to solve for `γ₂`:\n        `γ₂ = - (20 * ln(3)) / ln(2/3)`\n        `γ₂ = - (20 * ln(3)) / (ln(2) - ln(3))`\n        `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n        `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n5.  **Calculation**: Now, we calculate the numerical value.\n    *   Using the approximate values `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`:\n        `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n        `γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n        `γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\nThe calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2.

Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light, `c`.\n*   `τ` is the proper mean lifetime of the particle in its own rest frame.\n\nThe term `c * τ` represents the particle's proper decay length, which is a constant for a given type of particle. Let's call it `L_p`. The formula becomes:\n`f = exp(-d / (γ * L_p))`\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first scenario to find the proper decay length (`L_p`).**\n\nWe are given:\n*   Detector radius, `d = 30 m`\n*   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`\n*   Fraction of particles reaching the detector, `f₁ = 1/3`\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n`1/3 = exp(-30 / (20 * L_p))`\n\nTo solve for `L_p`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * L_p)`\n`-ln(3) = -1.5 / L_p`\n`L_p = 1.5 / ln(3)`\n\n**Step 2: Use the proper decay length to analyze the second scenario.**\n\nWe need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`, required for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector.\n\nWe are given:\n*   Detector radius, `d = 30 m`\n*   Fraction of particles reaching the detector, `f₂ = 2/3`\n\nThe equation for this scenario is:\n`2/3 = exp(-30 / (γ₂ * L_p))`\n\nTake the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(2/3) = -30 / (γ₂ * L_p)`\n\nNow, substitute the expression for `L_p` we found in Step 1:\n`ln(2/3) = -30 / (γ₂ * (1.5 / ln(3)))`\n`ln(2/3) = (-30 * ln(3)) / (1.5 * γ₂)`\n`ln(2/3) = -20 * ln(3) / γ₂`\n\nNow, we solve for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = -20 * ln(3) / ln(2/3)`\nUsing the logarithm property `ln(a/b) = ln(a) - ln(b)` and `ln(a/b) = -ln(b/a)`:\n`γ₂ = -20 * ln(3) / -ln(3/2)`\n`γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the numerical value.**\n\nUsing the approximate values for the natural logarithms:\n*   `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986`\n*   `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`\n\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * 1.0986 / 0.4055`\n`γ₂ ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055`\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.185`\n\nThis value is very close to 54.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 68\nB) 54\nC) 28\nD) 40\n\nThe calculated Lorentz factor of approximately 54 matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe search results confirm the standard physics principles I used. Specifically:\n\n*   The probability of a particle surviving for a time `t` is given by an exponential decay law.\n*   The lifetime of a moving particle is subject to time dilation, where the lifetime in the lab frame (`T` or `Δt`) is the proper lifetime (`T₀` or `Δt₀`) multiplied by the Lorentz factor γ. The formula is `T = γT₀`.\n*   The survival probability `P(t)` can be written as `exp(-t / (γτ))`, where `τ` is the mean lifetime in the particle's rest frame.\n*   This principle is famously demonstrated by the detection of cosmic-ray muons at the Earth's surface, which would not be possible in such large numbers without the effect of time dilation.\n\nThe problem is a direct application of these confirmed principles. My derivation and calculation are consistent with the physics described in the search results.\n\n**Problem Analysis**\n\n1.  **Fraction of surviving particles (f):** The number of particles `N` remaining from an initial number `N₀` after a time `t` is given by the exponential decay law: `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / τ_lab)`. The fraction is `f = N(t)/N₀ = exp(-t / τ_lab)`.\n2.  **Time of flight (t):** The particles are ultra-relativistic, so their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. The time to travel the detector radius `R` is `t ≈ R/c`.\n3.  **Lab-frame lifetime (τ_lab):** Due to time dilation, the lifetime of the particles as measured in the laboratory is increased by the Lorentz factor `γ`. If the proper lifetime (in the particle's own rest frame) is `τ₀`, then the lab-frame lifetime is `τ_lab = γ * τ₀`.\n4.  **Combined Formula:** Substituting these into the fraction equation gives:\n    `f = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ₀))`\n\n**Calculation**\n\nLet's set up the equations for the two scenarios. The term `R / (c * τ₀)` is a constant for this particle and detector setup.\n\n*   **Scenario 1:**\n    *   Fraction `f₁` = 1/3\n    *   Lorentz factor `γ₁` = 20\n    *   `1/3 = exp(-R / (20 * c * τ₀))`\n    *   Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: `ln(1/3) = -R / (20 * c * τ₀)`\n    *   This simplifies to `ln(3) = R / (20 * c * τ₀)`\n\n*   **Scenario 2:**\n    *   Fraction `f₂` = 2/3\n    *   Lorentz factor `γ₂` = ?\n    *   `2/3 = exp(-R / (γ₂ * c * τ₀))`\n    *   Taking the natural logarithm: `ln(2/3) = -R / (γ₂ * c * τ₀)`\n    *   This simplifies to `ln(3/2) = R / (γ₂ * c * τ₀)`\n\nNow we have a system of two equations.

The fraction of particles that survive to reach the detector wall is determined by their lifetime in the laboratory's frame of reference, which is extended due to their high velocity.\n\n### Key Principles:\n*   **Particle Decay:** The number of unstable particles (N) remaining after a time (t) from an initial sample (N₀) is given by the exponential decay law: `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / τ_lab)`, where `τ_lab` is the mean lifetime of the particle in the laboratory's reference frame.\n*   **Time Dilation:** Due to relativistic effects, the lifetime of a moving particle as measured in the lab frame (`τ_lab`) is longer than its lifetime in its own rest frame (its proper lifetime, `τ_proper`). This relationship is defined by the Lorentz factor (γ): `τ_lab = γ * τ_proper`.\n*   **Survival Fraction:** The fraction of particles reaching the detector is N/N₀.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n1.  **Formulate the Survival Equation:**\n    The time it takes for the particles to travel from the center to the detector wall (radius R = 30 m) in the lab frame is `t = R / v`. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. So, `t ≈ R / c`.\n\n    Substituting this and the time-dilated lifetime into the decay law gives the fraction of surviving particles:\n    `N/N₀ = exp(- (R/c) / (γ * τ_proper) )`\n    `N/N₀ = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ_proper))`\n\n2.  **Use the Initial Conditions:**\n    We are given that when the Lorentz factor (γ₁) is 20, one-third (1/3) of the particles reach the detector.\n    `1/3 = exp(-30 / (20 * c * τ_proper))`\n\n    To simplify, we can solve for the constant term `30 / (c * τ_proper)`, which represents the ratio of the detector radius to the particle's mean decay length at rest.\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * c * τ_proper)`\n    `-ln(3) = -30 / (20 * c * τ_proper)`\n    `20 * ln(3) = 30 / (c * τ_proper)`\n\n3.  **Use the Target Conditions to Find the New Lorentz Factor:**\n    We need to find the new Lorentz factor (γ₂) that allows two-thirds (2/3) of the particles to reach the detector.\n    `2/3 = exp(-30 / (γ₂ * c * τ_proper))`\n\n    Again, take the natural logarithm:\n    `ln(2/3) = -30 / (γ₂ * c * τ_proper)`\n    `-ln(3/2) = -30 / (γ₂ * c * τ_proper)`\n    `γ₂ * ln(3/2) = 30 / (c * τ_proper)`\n\n4.  **Solve for γ₂:**\n    Now we have two expressions for the constant `30 / (c * τ_proper)`. We can set them equal to each other:\n    `γ₂ * ln(3/2) = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n    Solving for γ₂:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986) / (0.4055)`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\nThe calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2.

The key concepts are:\n    *   **Exponential Decay:** The number of particles `N` that survive after a time `t` is given by `N(t) = N0 * exp(-t / τ_lab)`, where `N0` is the initial number of particles and `τ_lab` is the particle's lifetime in the lab frame.\n    *   **Time Dilation:** The lifetime of a moving particle (`τ_lab`) is longer than its lifetime when at rest (its proper lifetime `τ`). This is described by the equation `τ_lab = γ * τ`, where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   **Relativistic Travel Time:** The particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" meaning their speed `v` is very close to the speed of light, `c`. The time it takes for them to travel a distance `d` (the detector radius) is `t = d / v ≈ d / c`.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Equation:** We can combine these concepts.

We use the same equation and the value of `K` we just found.\n    *   `2/3 = exp(-30 / (γ2 * K))`\n    *   `ln(2/3) = -30 / (γ2 * K)`\n    *   `γ2 = -30 / (K * ln(2/3))`\n    *   Substitute the expression for `K`:\n    *   `γ2 = -30 / ((1.5 / ln(3)) * ln(2/3))`\n    *   `γ2 = (-30 / 1.5) * (ln(3) / ln(2/3))`\n    *   `γ2 = -20 * (ln(3) / (ln(2) - ln(3)))`\n    *   `γ2 = 20 * (ln(3) / (ln(3) - ln(2)))`\n    *   Alternatively, using `ln(2/3) = -ln(1.5)`:\n    *   `γ2 = 20 * ln(3) / ln(1.5)`\n    *   We will calculate this value using Python.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given Information ---\n# Case 1\ngamma1 = 20\nfraction1 = 1/3\n\n# Case 2\nfraction2 = 2/3\n\n# --- Calculation ---\n# The survival fraction equation is: fraction = exp(-d / (gamma * tau_c))\n# where d is distance, gamma is Lorentz factor, and tau_c is a constant (proper lifetime * c).\n# Rearranging the formula: ln(fraction) = -d / (gamma * tau_c)\n# We can form a ratio to eliminate the unknown constants d and tau_c:\n# ln(fraction1) / ln(fraction2) = [-d / (gamma1 * tau_c)] / [-d / (gamma2 * tau_c)]\n# ln(fraction1) / ln(fraction2) = gamma2 / gamma1\n# So, gamma2 = gamma1 * (ln(fraction1) / ln(fraction2))\n\n# Substitute the values\n# Note: log(1/3) is -log(3) and log(2/3) is -log(1.5)\n# The negative signs cancel out.\ngamma2 = gamma1 * (math.log(3) / math.log(1.5))\n\n\n# --- Output the result and the choices ---\nprint(f\"The Lorentz factor required for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector is: {gamma2:.2f}\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing this result with the given options:\")\nprint(\"A) 28\")\nprint(\"B) 54\")\nprint(\"C) 40\")\nprint(\"D) 68\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value is approximately 54.19, which corresponds to option B.\")\n\n<<<B>>>\n```\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: \nErrors:   File \"<stdin>\", line 35\n    <<<B>>>\n    ^^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Physics Principles\nThe problem involves the decay of relativistic particles. The key concepts are:\n1.  **Radioactive Decay:** The number of particles, N, that have not decayed after a time `t` is given by the exponential decay law: `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t/τ_proper)`, where `N₀` is the initial number of particles and `τ_proper` is the mean proper lifetime (the lifetime in the particle's own rest frame).\n2.  **Special Relativity (Time Dilation):** A moving particle's internal \"clock\" runs slower as observed from a stationary frame (the lab/detector frame). The mean lifetime of the particle as measured in the lab frame (`τ_lab`) is related to its proper lifetime (`τ_proper`) by the Lorentz factor (`γ`): `τ_lab = γ * τ_proper`.\n3.  **Travel Time:** The particles are created at the center and travel to the inner wall of the detector. The distance they travel is the radius `R`. Since they move at ultra-relativistic velocities, their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. The time taken for this journey in the lab frame is `t_lab = R / v ≈ R / c`.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Governing Equation\nThe fraction of particles that survive the journey to the detector wall is `N(t_lab) / N₀`. The time `t` in the decay law must be the time elapsed in the lab frame, `t_lab`, but the lifetime `τ` must be the lifetime as observed in the lab frame, `τ_lab`.\n\nFraction surviving, `F = N(t_lab) / N₀ = exp(-t_lab / τ_lab)`\n\nNow, substitute the expressions for `t_lab` and `τ_lab`:\n*   `t_lab ≈ R / c`\n*   `τ_lab = γ * τ_proper`\n\nSo, the fraction of particles reaching the detector is:\n`F = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ_proper))`\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Two Scenarios\n\nLet's define a constant `K = (R / c) / τ_proper`. This constant depends on the detector's radius and the particle's intrinsic properties, which do not change between the two scenarios.\nThe equation simplifies to: `F = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n**Scenario 1:**\n*   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`\n*   Fraction surviving, `F₁ = 1/3`\n\nPlugging these values into our equation:\n`1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n\nTo solve for `K`, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n`ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n`-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n`K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n*   Lorentz factor, `γ₂ = ?` (This is what we need to find)\n*   Fraction surviving, `F₂ = 2/3`\n\nPlugging these values into the same equation:\n`2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n\nAgain, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`\n`-ln(3/2) = -K / γ₂`\n`K = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\n### Step 4: Solve for the Unknown Lorentz Factor (γ₂)\nWe now have two expressions for the same constant `K`. We can set them equal to each other:\n`20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\nNow, we can isolate `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))`\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Final Value\nLet's use the approximate values for the natural logarithms:\n*   `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986`\n*   `ln(3/2) = ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`\n\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.7095`\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\nThis value is approximately 54.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n*   The actual radius of the detector (30 m) and the speed of light (c) are not needed for the final calculation because they are part of a constant factor that gets canceled out.\n*   The \"ultra-relativistic\" approximation (`v ≈ c`) is crucial and simplifies the travel time calculation.\n*   The distinction between proper time (`τ_proper`) and lab time (`τ_lab`) is the core of the problem. Time dilation is what allows more particles to reach the detector at higher energies (higher γ).\n*   To get a larger fraction of particles to survive, they need to experience less time decay from the lab's perspective. This is achieved by increasing the time dilation effect, which requires a higher Lorentz factor `γ`. Our result `γ₂ > γ₁` is consistent with this physical intuition.\n\nThe calculated value of `γ₂` is approximately 54, which matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nThis problem requires understanding the concepts of special relativity, specifically time dilation, and how it affects particle decay.\n\n**1. The Physics of Particle Decay**\n\nThe fraction of particles ($f$) that survive after a certain proper time ($\\tau$) is given by the exponential decay law:\n$f = N/N_0 = e^{-\\tau/\\tau_0}$\nwhere $\\tau_0$ is the mean proper lifetime of the particle (its lifetime in its own rest frame).\n\n**2. Time Dilation in the Lab Frame**\n\nThe particles are moving at relativistic speeds relative to the detector (the lab frame). Due to time dilation, the time elapsed in the particle's rest frame ($\\tau$) is shorter than the time measured in the lab frame ($t$). The relationship is:\n$\\tau = t / \\gamma$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n**3. Time of Flight**\n\nThe time it takes for a particle to travel the radius $R$ of the detector in the lab frame is $t = R/v$. Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their speed $v$ is approximately the speed of light, $c$.\nSo, $t \\approx R/c$.\n\n**4. Combining the Concepts**\n\nWe can substitute the expressions for $t$ and $\\tau$ into the decay equation:\n*   First, find the proper time elapsed for a particle reaching the wall:\n    $\\tau = t / \\gamma \\approx (R/c) / \\gamma = R / (\\gamma c)$\n*   Now, substitute this proper time into the decay formula:\n    $f = e^{-\\tau/\\tau_0} = e^{-R / (\\gamma c \\tau_0)}$\n\n**5. Setting up the Ratios**\n\nThe term $R/(c\\tau_0)$ is a constant for this specific particle and detector setup. Let's call this constant $K$.

The time it takes for them to reach the detector's inner wall (a distance R = 30 m) in the laboratory's frame of reference is `t_lab = R / v`.

The survival probability of a particle traveling a certain distance depends on its speed, or more precisely, its Lorentz factor (γ).\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Understanding Particle Decay:** The decay of unstable particles is an exponential process. The fraction of particles, P, that survive after a time *t* in their own rest frame is given by P = e^(-t/τ), where τ is the proper mean lifetime of the particle.\n\n2.  **Time Dilation:** According to special relativity, time for a moving particle, as observed from a stationary frame (the lab frame), appears to run slower. This effect is called time dilation. The particle's lifetime in the lab frame (t') is dilated by the Lorentz factor, γ: t' = γτ. This means the particle's average decay length in the lab is L = vγτ, where v is its velocity.\n\n3.  **Applying to the Problem:**\n    *   The particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" so their velocity *v* is approximately the speed of light, *c*.\n    *   The time it takes to travel from the center to the detector wall (a distance R = 30 m) in the lab frame is t_lab = R/v ≈ R/c.\n    *   The survival probability, P, is the probability that the particle survives for at least the time t_lab.

The key concepts are:\n1.  **Radioactive Decay:** The number of undecayed particles `N` from an initial population `N₀` after a time `t` is given by the exponential decay law: `N(t) = N₀ * e^(-t/τ_lifetime)`.\n2.  **Special Relativity (Time Dilation):** A particle moving with a Lorentz factor `γ` has its internal \"clock\" slowed down from the perspective of a stationary observer (the lab frame). Its lifetime in the lab frame (`τ_lab`) is longer than its lifetime in its own rest frame (the proper lifetime `τ`). The relationship is `τ_lab = γτ`.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Governing Equation\nLet's express the survival fraction `N/N₀` in terms of the given parameters.\n*   The time it takes for a particle to travel from the center to the detector wall (a distance `R`) in the lab frame is `t_lab`. Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic\", their speed `v` is very close to the speed of light `c`. So, we can approximate `t_lab ≈ R/c`.\n*   The decay law, when viewed from the lab frame, uses the time elapsed in the lab frame (`t_lab`) and the particle's lifetime as measured in the lab frame (`τ_lab`).\n    `N/N₀ = e^(-t_lab / τ_lab)`\n*   Substituting the expressions for `t_lab` and `τ_lab`:\n    `N/N₀ = e^(-(R/c) / (γτ))`\n    This can be rewritten as:\n    `N/N₀ = e^(-R / (γcτ))`\n    Here, `R` is the detector radius, `γ` is the Lorentz factor, and `cτ` is a constant value for this specific type of particle (its mean decay length in its rest frame).\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the First Scenario\nWe are given the following information for the first scenario:\n*   Detector Radius `R = 30 m`\n*   Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`\n*   Survival fraction `N₁/N₀ = 1/3`\n\nLet's plug these into our equation:\n`1/3 = e^(-30 / (20 * cτ))`\n\nTo solve for the unknown `cτ`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * cτ)`\n`-ln(3) = -1.5 / (cτ)`\n`ln(3) = 1.5 / (cτ)` **(Equation 1)**\n\nThis equation contains all the information from the first scenario. We don't need to calculate the value of `cτ` yet.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Second Scenario\nNow we want to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`, that results in a different survival fraction.\n*   Required survival fraction `N₂/N₀ = 2/3`\n*   The radius `R` and the particle property `cτ` remain the same.\n\nThe equation for the second scenario is:\n`2/3 = e^(-30 / (γ₂ * cτ))`\n\nAgain, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(2/3) = -30 / (γ₂ * cτ)`\n`ln(2) - ln(3) = -30 / (γ₂ * cτ)`\n`-(ln(3) - ln(2)) = -30 / (γ₂ * cτ)`\n`ln(3/2) = 30 / (γ₂ * cτ)` **(Equation 2)**\n\n### Step 5: Solve for the new Lorentz factor `γ₂`\nWe now have a system of two equations. A simple way to solve this is to take the ratio of Equation 1 and Equation 2.\n\nDivide Equation 1 by Equation 2:\n`(ln(3)) / (ln(3/2)) = (1.5 / cτ) / (30 / (γ₂ * cτ))`\n\nThe `cτ` terms cancel out:\n`ln(3) / ln(3/2) = (1.5) * (γ₂ / 30)`\n`ln(3) / ln(3/2) = γ₂ / 20`\n\nNow, solve for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))`\n\n### Step 6: Calculate the Final Value\nUsing the approximate values for the natural logarithms:\n*   `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986`\n*   `ln(3/2) = ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`\n\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\nThis value is extremely close to 54.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n*   **Time Dilation:** The core of the problem is correctly applying the time dilation formula `τ_lab = γτ` to the lifetime of the particle. The time of flight `t_lab` is measured in the lab frame, so the lifetime must also be expressed in the lab frame for the decay equation to be consistent.\n*   **Constant Properties:** It is essential to recognize that the particle's proper lifetime `τ` (and thus `cτ`) is an intrinsic property and does not change between the two scenarios. The detector radius `R` is also constant.

The relationship is given by:\n`τ = γ * τ₀`\nwhere γ is the Lorentz factor.\n\nSubstituting this into the decay equation gives:\n`N(t) = N₀ * e^(-t / (γ * τ₀))`\n\nThe time `t` it takes for a particle to travel the radius of the detector, `R`, is `t = R/v`. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light, `c`. So, `t ≈ R/c`.\n\nNow we can write the fraction of surviving particles, `N/N₀`, as:\n`N/N₀ = e^(-R / (c * γ * τ₀))`\n\nLet's analyze the two given scenarios:\n\n**Scenario 1:**\n-   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`\n-   Fraction of surviving particles, `N/N₀ = 1/3`\n\nPlugging these values into the equation:\n`1/3 = e^(-R / (c * 20 * τ₀))`\n\nTo solve for the unknown term `R/(c*τ₀)`, we can take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(1/3) = -R / (c * 20 * τ₀)`\n`-ln(3) = -R / (c * 20 * τ₀)`\n`ln(3) = R / (c * 20 * τ₀)`\n\nFrom this, we can find the value of the constant term `R/(c*τ₀)`:\n`R / (c * τ₀) = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n-   Fraction of surviving particles, `N/N₀ = 2/3`\n-   We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`.\n\nPlugging these values into the general equation:\n`2/3 = e^(-R / (c * γ₂ * τ₀))`\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(2/3) = -R / (c * γ₂ * τ₀)`\n`ln(2) - ln(3) = -R / (c * γ₂ * τ₀)`\n`-(ln(3) - ln(2)) = -R / (c * γ₂ * τ₀)`\n`ln(3/2) = R / (c * γ₂ * τ₀)`\n\nNow we can solve for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = (R / (c * τ₀)) / ln(3/2)`\n\nWe can now substitute the expression for `R/(c*τ₀)` that we found in Scenario 1:\n`γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)`\n`γ₂ = (20 * 1.0986) / 0.4055`\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\nThis value is approximately 54.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nThe problem requires us to determine the Lorentz factor (`γ`) needed for a certain fraction of particles to survive a journey to a detector wall.

If its proper lifetime (in its own rest frame) is `τ`, the lab-frame lifetime is `τ_lab = γ * τ`.\n\n2.  **Survival Fraction Formula:**\n    The fraction of particles that survive, `f = N/N₀`, can be expressed by substituting the time dilation formula into the decay law:\n    `f = exp(-t / (γ * τ))`\n    The time `t` is the time of flight from the center to the detector wall in the lab frame. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic (`v ≈ c`), this time is `t ≈ R/c`, where `R` is the detector radius and `c` is the speed of light.\n    Therefore, the survival fraction is:\n    `f = exp(-R / (c * γ * τ))`\n\n3.  **Analyzing the Two Scenarios:**\n    Let's define a constant `K = R / (c * τ)`. This constant depends only on the detector's size and the intrinsic properties of the particle, not on its energy (or Lorentz factor). The formula simplifies to:\n    `f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n    *   **Scenario 1 (Initial Condition):**\n        We are given that when the Lorentz factor is `γ₁ = 20`, the survival fraction is `f₁ = 1/3`.\n        `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n        By taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we can solve for `K`:\n        `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n        `-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n        `K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n    *   **Scenario 2 (Desired Condition):**\n        We want to find the Lorentz factor `γ₂` that results in a survival fraction of `f₂ = 2/3`.\n        `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n        Again, taking the natural logarithm:\n        `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`\n        `-ln(3/2) = -K / γ₂`\n        `K = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\n4.  **Solving for the New Lorentz Factor (`γ₂`):**\n    We now have two expressions for the constant `K`, which we can set equal to each other:\n    `20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n    Solving for `γ₂`, we get:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n5.  **Numerical Calculation:**\n    The provided code output shows the result of calculating this expression:\n    `γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.19.

This law must account for time dilation, a relativistic effect where time for a moving particle passes slower than for a stationary observer. The particle's lifetime in the lab frame (*t_lab*) is its proper lifetime (*τ*, the lifetime in its own rest frame) multiplied by the Lorentz factor (γ).\n\nThe formula for the fraction of particles remaining (N/N₀) after traveling a distance *R* at a velocity *v* is:\n\n**N/N₀ = e<sup>(-t / (γτ))</sup>**\n\nSince the particles are ultra-relativistic, their velocity *v* is approximately the speed of light, *c*. Therefore, the time of flight *t* to the detector wall is *R/c*. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n\n**N/N₀ = e<sup>(-R / (γcτ))</sup>**\n\n### Calculation Steps\n\nWe are presented with two scenarios:\n\n*   **Scenario 1:** A fraction of 1/3 of the particles reaches the detector.\n    *   N/N₀ = 1/3\n    *   Lorentz factor, γ₁ = 20\n    *   Radius, R = 30 m\n\n*   **Scenario 2:** A fraction of 2/3 of the particles reaches the detector.\n    *   N/N₀ = 2/3\n    *   Lorentz factor, γ₂ = ?\n    *   Radius, R = 30 m\n\nBy setting up equations for both scenarios, we can find the unknown Lorentz factor, γ₂.\n\n1.  **For Scenario 1:**\n    1/3 = e<sup>(-30 / (20 * cτ))</sup>\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    ln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * cτ)\n    ln(3) = 1.5 / (cτ)\n\n2.  **For Scenario 2:**\n    2/3 = e<sup>(-30 / (γ₂ * cτ))</sup>\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    ln(2/3) = -30 / (γ₂ * cτ)\n    ln(3/2) = 30 / (γ₂ * cτ)\n\n3.  **Solving for the new Lorentz factor (γ₂):**\n    We can create a ratio of the two equations to eliminate the unknown proper lifetime (τ):\n\n    (ln(3)) / (ln(3/2)) = (1.5 / cτ) / (30 / (γ₂ * cτ))\n    (ln(3)) / (ln(3/2)) = (1.5 * γ₂ * cτ) / (30 * cτ)\n    (ln(3)) / (ln(3/2)) = (1.5 * γ₂) / 30\n    γ₂ = (30 / 1.5) * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))\n    γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / (ln(3) - ln(2)))\n\n    Using the approximate values ln(3) ≈ 1.0986 and ln(2) ≈ 0.6931:\n    γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / (1.0986 - 0.6931))\n    γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)\n    γ₂ ≈ 54.18\n\nThe calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understanding Particle Decay and Time Dilation**\n    The fraction of particles that survive after a time `t` in the laboratory frame is given by the exponential decay law:\n    `N/N₀ = exp(-t / τ_lab)`\n    where:\n    *   `N` is the number of particles remaining.\n    *   `N₀` is the initial number of particles.\n    *   `t` is the time elapsed in the laboratory frame.\n    *   `τ_lab` is the average lifetime of the particles in the laboratory frame.\n\n    Due to time dilation in special relativity, the lifetime of a moving particle (`τ_lab`) is longer than its proper lifetime (`τ₀`, the lifetime in its own rest frame). The relationship is:\n    `τ_lab = γ * τ₀`\n    where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n\n    Combining these two equations, we get:\n    `N/N₀ = exp(-t / (γ * τ₀))`\n\n2.  **Applying the Formula to the First Scenario**\n    In the first case, we are given:\n    *   The fraction of particles reaching the detector: `N/N₀ = 1/3`\n    *   The Lorentz factor: `γ₁ = 20`\n    *   The radius of the detector: `R = 30 m`\n\n    The time `t` it takes for the ultra-relativistic particles to reach the detector wall is `t = R / c`, where `c` is the speed of light.\n    Plugging these values into the formula:\n    `1/3 = exp(-(R/c) / (γ₁ * τ₀))`\n    `1/3 = exp(-30 / (c * 20 * τ₀))`\n\n    To solve for the unknown proper lifetime `τ₀`, we can take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * c * τ₀)`\n    `-ln(3) = -30 / (20 * c * τ₀)`\n    `ln(3) = 30 / (20 * c * τ₀)`\n\n    Let's rearrange this equation to isolate the constant term `30 / (c * τ₀)`:\n    `20 * ln(3) = 30 / (c * τ₀)`\n\n3.  **Applying the Formula to the Second Scenario**\n    In the second case, we want to find the new Lorentz factor (`γ₂`) required for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector:\n    *   Desired fraction of surviving particles: `N/N₀ = 2/3`\n    *   The time of flight `t = R/c` and proper lifetime `τ₀` remain the same.\n\n    Using the same formula:\n    `2/3 = exp(-(R/c) / (γ₂ * τ₀))`\n    `2/3 = exp(-30 / (c * γ₂ * τ₀))`\n\n    Again, take the natural logarithm:\n    `ln(2/3) = -30 / (γ₂ * c * τ₀)`\n    `ln(2) - ln(3) = -30 / (γ₂ * c * τ₀)`\n    `-(ln(3) - ln(2)) = -30 / (γ₂ * c * τ₀)`\n    `ln(3/2) = 30 / (γ₂ * c * τ₀)`\n\n    Rearranging this gives:\n    `γ₂ * ln(3/2) = 30 / (c * τ₀)`\n\n4.  **Solving for the New Lorentz Factor (γ₂)**\n    We now have two expressions equal to the same constant `30 / (c * τ₀)`:\n    1.  `20 * ln(3)`\n    2.  `γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\n    By setting them equal to each other, we can solve for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ * ln(3/2) = 20 * ln(3)`\n    `γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))`\n\n    Now, we can calculate the numerical value:\n    *   `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986`\n    *   `ln(3/2) = ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`\n\n    `γ₂ = 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055) ≈ 20 * 2.7092 ≈ 54.185`\n\nThis value is approximately 54.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nThe problem requires determining the Lorentz factor (γ) needed for a specific fraction of decaying particles to reach a detector. This involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and the exponential decay law.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Survival Fraction Formula**: The fraction of particles (`f`) that survive after a time `t` in the laboratory's frame of reference is given by the relativistic decay formula. The decay is based on the particle's proper lifetime (`τ`), but the time it experiences is dilated. In the lab frame, the effective lifetime is `γτ`. The time of flight to the detector wall is `t = R/v`, where `R` is the detector radius and `v` is the particle's velocity. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, we can approximate their velocity `v` with the speed of light `c`, so `t ≈ R/c`.\n\n    The survival fraction is therefore:\n    `f = exp(-t / (γ * τ)) = exp(-R / (c * γ * τ))`\n\n2.  **Initial Condition**: We are given that when the Lorentz factor `γ₁` is 20, one-third of the particles reach the detector.\n    *   `f₁ = 1/3`\n    *   `γ₁ = 20`\n\n    Plugging these values into the formula:\n    `1/3 = exp(-R / (c * 20 * τ))`\n\n    To solve for the constant part of the exponent, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = -R / (20 * c * τ)`\n    `-ln(3) = -R / (20 * c * τ)`\n\n    This gives us a value for the constant term `k = R / (c * τ)`:\n    `k = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n3.  **Final Condition**: We need to find the new Lorentz factor `γ₂` that results in two-thirds of the particles reaching the detector.\n    *   `f₂ = 2/3`\n    *   `γ₂ = ?`\n\n    Using the same survival formula:\n    `2/3 = exp(-R / (c * γ₂ * τ)) = exp(-k / γ₂)`\n\n    Again, we take the natural logarithm:\n    `ln(2/3) = -k / γ₂`\n    `-ln(3/2) = -k / γ₂`\n    `ln(3/2) = k / γ₂`\n\n4.  **Calculate γ₂**: Now we can solve for `γ₂` and substitute the expression for `k` we found in step 2:\n    `γ₂ = k / ln(3/2)`\n    `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)`\n\n    Using the approximate values for the natural logarithms (`ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`):\n    `γ₂ ≈ (20 * 1.0986) / 0.4055`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\nThe calculated value of approximately 54.18 is closest to the option 54.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### **1. Core Physics Principles**\n\nThe problem combines two fundamental concepts from modern physics:\n*   **Radioactive Decay:** The fraction `f` of unstable particles that survive after a time `t` follows an exponential decay law: `f = exp(-t / T)`, where `T` is the mean lifetime of the particle in the frame of reference where time `t` is measured.\n*   **Special Relativity (Time Dilation):** The mean lifetime of a particle moving at a relativistic speed is longer when measured from a stationary frame (the lab) compared to its lifetime measured in its own rest frame (the proper lifetime). This dilated lifetime, `T`, is related to the proper lifetime, `τ`, by the Lorentz factor, `γ`: `T = γτ`.\n\n### **2. Formulation of the Governing Equation**\n\n1.  **Time of Flight (t):** The particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" meaning their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. The time it takes for them to travel the detector's radius `R` in the lab frame is `t = R/v ≈ R/c`.\n2.  **Survival Fraction:** The fraction of particles that reach the detector wall is determined by the decay law, using the time of flight in the lab frame (`t`) and the dilated lifetime in the lab frame (`T`):\n    `f = exp(-t / T)`\n3.  **Combining the Concepts:** Substitute the expressions for `t` and `T` into the survival fraction equation:\n    `f = exp(-(R/c) / (γτ))`\n\n### **3. Analysis of the Two Scenarios**\n\nThe term `R/(cτ)` is a constant for this specific particle and detector. Let's call this constant `K`. The simplified equation is:\n`f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\nWe can solve for `γ` by taking the natural logarithm:\n`ln(f) = -K / γ`\n`γ * ln(f) = -K`\nSince `-K` is a constant, the product `γ * ln(f)` must be the same for both scenarios.\n\n*   **Scenario 1:**\n    *   Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`\n    *   Fraction surviving `f₁ = 1/3`\n\n*   **Scenario 2:**\n    *   Lorentz factor `γ₂ = ?` (This is what we need to find)\n    *   Fraction surviving `f₂ = 2/3`\n\nSetting the product `γ * ln(f)` equal for both scenarios:\n`γ₁ * ln(f₁) = γ₂ * ln(f₂)`\n`20 * ln(1/3) = γ₂ * ln(2/3)`\n\n### **4. Solving for the Unknown Lorentz Factor (`γ₂`)**\n\nWe can now solve for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = 20 * (ln(1/3) / ln(2/3))`\n\nUsing the logarithm properties `ln(1/x) = -ln(x)` and `ln(a/b) = -ln(b/a)`:\n`γ₂ = 20 * (-ln(3)) / (-ln(3/2))`\n`γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n### **5. Numerical Calculation**\n\nUsing the known values for natural logarithms:\n*   `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986`\n*   `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`\n\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.7095`\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\n### **Careful Points & Conclusion**\n\n*   **Physical Intuition Check:** To have a larger fraction of particles survive (from 1/3 to 2/3), their internal \"clocks\" must run slower relative to the lab. This requires a larger time dilation effect, which is achieved with a higher Lorentz factor `γ`. Our result, `γ₂ ≈ 54.19`, is indeed greater than `γ₁ = 20`, confirming the physical reasonableness of the answer.\n*   **Role of Detector Radius:** The detector radius `R = 30m` is not required for the final calculation because it is part of a constant term that is eliminated when forming a ratio between the two scenarios.\n*   **Matching with Options:** The calculated value `γ₂ ≈ 54.19` is extremely close to the option `54`.\n\nFinal comparison to the given options:\nA) 54\nB) 28\nC) 68\nD) 40\n\nThe correct answer is 54.\n\n<<<A>>>"

The time it takes for them to reach the detector in the lab frame is:\n    t_flight = R / v ≈ R / c\n\n5.  **Fraction of Surviving Particles:** The fraction of particles that reach the detector is the number of particles that have not decayed after the time of flight, divided by the initial number.\n    Fraction (F) = N(t_flight) / N₀ = exp(-t_flight / (γ * τ))\n    Substituting t_flight ≈ R/c, we get:\n    F = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))\n\n6.  **Set up Equations for Both Scenarios:**\n    Let the constant term `K = R / (c * τ)`.

Understanding Relativistic Particle Decay\n\nThe fraction of unstable particles that survive after a certain time is governed by the principles of special relativity and exponential decay. Due to time dilation, a particle moving at a relativistic speed experiences time slower than an observer in a stationary reference frame (like the detector).\n\nThe formula for the fraction of surviving particles, `N/N₀`, is:\n\n`N/N₀ = exp(-t_lab / (γ * τ))`\n\nWhere:\n*   `N` is the number of particles that reach the detector.\n*   `N₀` is the initial number of particles.\n*   `t_lab` is the time taken to reach the detector wall in the lab's frame of reference.\n*   `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n*   `τ` (tau) is the mean lifetime of the particle in its own rest frame.\n\n### 2. Setting up the Equations\n\nThe particles are described as \"ultra-relativistic,\" meaning their velocity `v` is extremely close to the speed of light, `c`. The time it takes for them to travel the detector's radius `L` (30 m) is `t_lab = L / v ≈ L / c`.\n\nSo, the survival fraction formula can be written as:\n\n`N/N₀ = exp(-L / (γ * c * τ))`\n\nLet's define a constant `k = L / (c * τ)`, which depends on the detector radius and the particle's intrinsic properties. The equation simplifies to:\n\n`N/N₀ = exp(-k / γ)`\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n\n`ln(N/N₀) = -k / γ`\n`γ = -k / ln(N/N₀)`\n\n### 3. Using the Given Conditions\n\nWe have two scenarios:\n\n**Condition 1:**\n*   Lorentz factor, `γ₁` = 20\n*   Fraction of surviving particles, `(N/N₀)₁` = 1/3\n\n**Condition 2:**\n*   Lorentz factor, `γ₂` = ?\n*   Fraction of surviving particles, `(N/N₀)₂` = 2/3\n\nWe can set up a ratio to eliminate the unknown constant `k`:\n\n`γ₂ / γ₁ = [-k / ln((N/N₀)₂)] / [-k / ln((N/N₀)₁)]`\n`γ₂ / γ₁ = ln((N/N₀)₁) / ln((N/N₀)₂)`\n\nNow, we can solve for `γ₂`:\n\n`γ₂ = γ₁ * [ln(1/3) / ln(2/3)]`\n\n### 4. Calculation\n\nUsing the properties of logarithms (`ln(a/b) = ln(a) - ln(b)` and `ln(1/x) = -ln(x)`), we can simplify the expression:\n\n`γ₂ = 20 * [-ln(3) / (ln(2) - ln(3))]`\n`γ₂ = 20 * [ln(3) / (ln(3) - ln(2))]`\n\nNow, we use the known values for the natural logarithms of 2 and 3:\n*   ln(3) ≈ 1.0986\n*   ln(2) ≈ 0.6931\n\nPlugging these values into the equation:\n\n`γ₂ = 20 * [1.0986 / (1.0986 - 0.6931)]`\n`γ₂ = 20 * [1.0986 / 0.4055]`\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\nThis result is closest to 54.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:** The problem involves the exponential decay of particles and the time dilation effect from special relativity. The fraction of particles, `f`, that survive after a time `t` in the lab frame is given by `f = exp(-t / τ_lab)`, where `τ_lab` is the particle's lifetime in the lab frame.\n2.  **Apply Time Dilation:** The lifetime in the lab frame (`τ_lab`) is related to the particle's proper lifetime (`τ₀`, its lifetime in its own rest frame) by the Lorentz factor `γ`: `τ_lab = γ * τ₀`.\n3.  **Determine the Travel Time:** The particles are ultra-relativistic, so their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light, `c`. The time `t` it takes for them to travel the detector radius `R` is `t ≈ R / c`.\n4.  **Formulate the Core Equation:** By substituting the expressions for `t` and `τ_lab` into the decay formula, we get:\n    `f = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ₀)) = exp(-R / (c * γ * τ₀))`\n    The term `R / (c * τ₀)` is a constant for this specific particle and detector setup. Let's call this constant `K`. So, `f = exp(-K / γ)`.\n5.  **Use the Initial Condition:** We are given that when the Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`, the fraction of surviving particles is `f₁ = 1/3`. We can use this to find the constant `K`.\n    `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`.\n    This gives us `K = -20 * ln(1/3) = 20 * ln(3)`.\n6.  **Solve for the New Lorentz Factor:** We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`, for which the fraction of surviving particles is `f₂ = 2/3`.\n    `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n    Taking the natural logarithm: `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`.\n    Solving for `γ₂`: `γ₂ = -K / ln(2/3)`.\n7.  **Calculate the Final Value:** Now, substitute the value of `K` we found in step 5 into the equation from step 6.\n    `γ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / ln(2/3) = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`.\n8.  **Code the Calculation:** Write a Python script to compute this value and compare it to the given options.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# This problem can be solved by relating the fraction of particles reaching the detector\n# to the Lorentz factor and the particle's proper lifetime.\n\n# The fraction of particles 'f' that do not decay is given by f = exp(-t / τ_lab),\n# where t is the time in the lab frame and τ_lab is the dilated lifetime.\n# t = R / v ≈ R / c (since particles are ultra-relativistic)\n# τ_lab = γ * τ₀ (where γ is the Lorentz factor and τ₀ is the proper lifetime)\n# So, f = exp(-R / (c * γ * τ₀))\n\n# Let's define a constant C = R / (c * τ₀).

The number of particles, N, that have not decayed after a certain time is described by the exponential decay law. This law is most fundamentally expressed in the particle's own rest frame. The connection between the particle's rest frame and the laboratory frame (the detector) is made through the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Decay Equation:**\n    *   In the particle's rest frame, the number of particles remaining after a proper time `t'` is given by:\n        `N(t') = N₀ * exp(-t' / τ)`\n        where `N₀` is the initial number of particles and `τ` is the mean proper lifetime of the particle.\n    *   The fraction of particles that survive is `N/N₀ = exp(-t' / τ)`.\n\n3.  **Relate Lab Frame and Rest Frame (Time Dilation):**\n    *   The particles are created at the center of the detector and travel a distance `R` (the radius) to reach the inner wall.\n    *   In the lab frame, the time taken for this journey is `t_lab = R / v`, where `v` is the particle's velocity.\n    *   The problem states the particles are \"ultra-relativistic\", so we can approximate their velocity `v ≈ c` (the speed of light). Thus, `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n    *   Due to time dilation, the time elapsed in the lab frame (`t_lab`) is longer than the time elapsed in the particle's rest frame (`t'`). The relationship is given by the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n        `t_lab = γ * t'`\n    *   Therefore, the proper time experienced by the particle during its journey to the detector wall is:\n        `t' = t_lab / γ = (R / c) / γ = R / (γ * c)`\n\n4.  **Combine Decay and Relativity:**\n    *   Substitute the expression for the proper time `t'` into the survival fraction equation:\n        `N/N₀ = exp(-(R / (γ * c)) / τ) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n    *   The term `c*τ` is the mean distance a particle travels in its rest frame during its mean proper lifetime. This is a constant property of the particle. Let's call the constant `K = R / (c * τ)`. The equation simplifies to:\n        `N/N₀ = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n5.  **Use the Initial Condition to Find the Constant K:**\n    *   We are given that for a Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`, one third of the particles reach the detector.\n    *   `N₁/N₀ = 1/3`\n    *   Plugging these values into our equation:\n        `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n    *   To solve for `K`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n        `-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n        `K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n6.  **Solve for the New Lorentz Factor (γ₂):**\n    *   Now we need to find the Lorentz factor `γ₂` required for two thirds of the particles to reach the detector.\n    *   `N₂/N₀ = 2/3`\n    *   Using the same survival equation with the new values:\n        `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n    *   Take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`\n        `-ln(3/2) = -K / γ₂`\n        `ln(3/2) = K / γ₂`\n    *   Now, solve for `γ₂`:\n        `γ₂ = K / ln(3/2)`\n    *   Substitute the expression for `K` we found in the previous step:\n        `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    *   Using the approximate values for the natural logarithms: `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(3/2) = ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`.\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ (20 * 1.0986) / 0.4055`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2. This matches option A.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Distinguish Frames:** It is crucial to correctly distinguish between the proper time `t'` in the particle's rest frame and the observed time `t_lab` in the laboratory frame. The decay law exponent must use the proper time.\n*   **Ultra-relativistic Approximation:** The assumption `v ≈ c` is justified by the problem statement and simplifies the calculation of the lab-frame travel time.\n*   **Constant Property:** The mean proper lifetime `τ` (and thus the product `c*τ`) is an intrinsic property of the particle type and does not change when the particle's energy (and thus `γ`) changes.\n*   **Logical Check:** To have a larger fraction of particles survive (from 1/3 to 2/3), their internal clocks must run slower relative to the lab. This requires a larger time dilation effect, which means a higher Lorentz factor `γ`. Our result `γ₂ ≈ 54` is indeed greater than `γ₁ = 20`, which is consistent with the physics.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe problem involves the relativistic effect of time dilation on particle decay. The fraction of particles `N/N₀` that survive after a time `t` in the lab frame is given by the exponential decay law:\n\n`N/N₀ = exp(-t / τ_lab)`\n\nwhere `τ_lab` is the mean lifetime of the particle in the lab frame.\n\nDue to time dilation, the lifetime of a particle moving with a Lorentz factor `γ` is extended in the lab frame compared to its proper lifetime `τ_proper` (its lifetime in its own rest frame):\n\n`τ_lab = γ * τ_proper`\n\nThe time `t` it takes for the particles to travel the radius `R` of the detector at a velocity `v` is:\n\n`t = R / v`\n\nSince the particles are ultra-relativistic, their velocity `v` is very close to the speed of light `c`, so we can approximate `t ≈ R / c`.\n\nSubstituting these into the decay equation, we get the fraction of surviving particles as a function of the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n\n`N/N₀ = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ_proper)) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ_proper))`\n\nThe term `c * τ_proper` is a constant for a given type of particle, representing its mean decay length. Let's call the constant term `K = R / (c * τ_proper)`. The equation simplifies to:\n\n`N/N₀ = exp(-K / γ)`\n\nWe are given two scenarios:\n\n**Scenario 1:**\n*   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`\n*   Fraction surviving, `(N/N₀)₁ = 1/3`\n\nPlugging these values into the equation:\n`1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n`-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n`K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n*   Fraction surviving, `(N/N₀)₂ = 2/3`\n*   We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`.\n\nPlugging these values into the equation:\n`2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`\n`-ln(3/2) = -K / γ₂`\n`K = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\nNow we have two expressions for the constant `K`, so we can set them equal to each other:\n\n`20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\nFinally, we solve for `γ₂`:\n\n`γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\nUsing the provided code output for the calculation:\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\nThis value is closest to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo determine the required Lorentz factor, we can use the principles of special relativity applied to particle decay.\n\n### Analysis of the Physics\n\nThe number of particles, N, that survive after a time *t* in the laboratory frame is given by the exponential decay law:\n\nN = N₀ * exp(-t / τ_lab)\n\nWhere:\n*   **N₀** is the initial number of particles.\n*   **t** is the time elapsed in the laboratory frame.\n*   **τ_lab** is the average lifetime of the particles in the laboratory frame.\n\nDue to time dilation, the lifetime of a particle moving at a relativistic speed is longer in the lab frame than its proper lifetime (τ_proper), which is its lifetime in its own rest frame. The relationship is given by:\n\nτ_lab = γ * τ_proper\n\nwhere **γ** is the Lorentz factor.\n\nThe particles are created at the center of a spherical detector with a radius **R** of 30 meters. Since they travel at ultra-relativistic velocities, their speed *v* is approximately the speed of light, *c*. The time it takes for them to reach the detector wall in the lab frame is:\n\nt ≈ R / c\n\nSubstituting these into the decay equation, we get the fraction of particles that reach the detector:\n\nN/N₀ = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ_proper))\n\nThis can be simplified to:\n\nN/N₀ = exp(-R / (γ * cτ_proper))\n\nThe term `cτ_proper` is a constant for a specific type of particle, representing its proper decay length.\n\n### Calculation\n\nLet's set up equations for the two scenarios given in the problem.\n\n**Scenario 1:**\n*   Lorentz factor (γ₁) = 20\n*   Fraction of surviving particles (N₁/N₀) = 1/3\n*   Radius (R) = 30 m\n\nPlugging these values into our equation:\n\n1/3 = exp(-30 / (20 * cτ_proper))\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * cτ_proper)\n-ln(3) = -1.5 / (cτ_proper)\nln(3) = 1.5 / (cτ_proper)\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n*   Fraction of surviving particles (N₂/N₀) = 2/3\n*   Radius (R) = 30 m\n*   The Lorentz factor (γ₂) is what we need to find.\n\nThe equation for this scenario is:\n\n2/3 = exp(-30 / (γ₂ * cτ_proper))\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(2/3) = -30 / (γ₂ * cτ_proper)\n-ln(3/2) = -30 / (γ₂ * cτ_proper)\nln(3/2) = 30 / (γ₂ * cτ_proper)\n\n**Solving for the new Lorentz factor (γ₂):**\n\nWe now have a system of two equations.

This lifetime is dilated due to relativistic effects and is related to the particle's proper lifetime (τ₀, its lifetime in its own rest frame) and its Lorentz factor (γ) by the equation: τ_lab = γ * τ₀.\n\nThe time `t` it takes for the particles to travel from the center to the inner wall of the detector is the radius (R) divided by the particle's velocity (v). Since the particles are described as \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity is extremely close to the speed of light (c), so we can approximate `t ≈ R/c`.\n\nCombining these relationships, the survival fraction can be expressed as:\n\nN/N₀ = e<sup>-(R/c) / (γ * τ₀)</sup>\n\nWe can now set up a ratio using the two scenarios given in the problem.\n\n**Scenario 1:**\n*   Fraction of surviving particles (N₁/N₀) = 1/3\n*   Lorentz factor (γ₁) = 20\n\nPlugging these into the equation:\n1/3 = e<sup>-(R/c) / (20 * τ₀)</sup>\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides gives:\nln(1/3) = -(R/c) / (20 * τ₀)\n-ln(3) = -(R/c) / (20 * τ₀)\nln(3) = (R/c) / (20 * τ₀)\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n*   Fraction of surviving particles (N₂/N₀) = 2/3\n*   Lorentz factor (γ₂) = ?\n\nPlugging these values in:\n2/3 = e<sup>-(R/c) / (γ₂ * τ₀)</sup>\n\nTaking the natural logarithm:\nln(2/3) = -(R/c) / (γ₂ * τ₀)\n-ln(3/2) = -(R/c) / (γ₂ * τ₀)\nln(3/2) = (R/c) / (γ₂ * τ₀)\n\nNow we have a system of two equations.

Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. So, `t ≈ R/c`.\n\nThe mean lifetime `T` in the lab frame is related to the particle's proper lifetime `τ` (its lifetime in its own rest frame) by the time dilation formula:\n`T = γ * τ`\nwhere `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n\nSubstituting these into the decay equation, we get:\n`f = exp(-(R/c) / (γτ)) = exp(-R / (γcτ))`\n\nLet's define a constant `K = R / (cτ)`. This value is constant because the detector radius `R`, the speed of light `c`, and the proper lifetime `τ` of the particle type do not change between the two scenarios. The equation becomes:\n`f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\nWe can solve for `K` by taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(f) = -K / γ`\n`K = -γ * ln(f) = γ * ln(1/f)`\n\nNow we can use the information from the two scenarios to find the unknown Lorentz factor.\n\n**Scenario 1:**\n*   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`\n*   Fraction of particles reaching the detector, `f₁ = 1/3`\n\n`K = γ₁ * ln(1/f₁) = 20 * ln(1 / (1/3)) = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n*   Lorentz factor, `γ₂ = ?`\n*   Fraction of particles reaching the detector, `f₂ = 2/3`\n\n`K = γ₂ * ln(1/f₂) = γ₂ * ln(1 / (2/3)) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\nSince `K` is the same in both scenarios, we can set the two expressions for `K` equal to each other:\n`γ₂ * ln(3/2) = 20 * ln(3)`\n\nNow, we solve for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\nUsing the values `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`:\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * 1.0986 / 0.4055 ≈ 54.19`\n\nThis value is closest to 54.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThe problem describes a classic scenario involving special relativity and particle decay. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution.\n\n### **1. Understand the Physics**\n\n*   **Particle Decay:** The number of particles `N` remaining from an initial sample `N₀` after a time `t` in the particle's own rest frame is given by the exponential decay law:\n    `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / τ)`\n    where `τ` is the proper mean lifetime of the particle.\n\n*   **Time Dilation:** Since the particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, their time appears to run slower from the perspective of the laboratory (the detector). The lifetime of the particle as measured in the lab frame (`t_lab_lifetime`) is dilated by the Lorentz factor, `γ`:\n    `t_lab_lifetime = γ * τ`\n\n*   **Survival Fraction:** A particle \"reaches the detector\" if it survives for the time it takes to travel the radius `R` of the detector. The time of flight in the lab frame (`t_travel`) is:\n    `t_travel = R / v`\n    Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity `v` is extremely close to the speed of light `c`. So, we can approximate `t_travel ≈ R / c`.\n\nThe fraction of particles that survive (`f`) is the ratio `N / N₀` after the time `t_travel`. Using the decay law in the lab frame:\n`f = N(t_travel) / N₀ = exp(-t_travel / t_lab_lifetime)`\n\nSubstituting the expressions for `t_travel` and `t_lab_lifetime`, we get the key formula:\n`f = exp(-(R/c) / (γτ))`\n\nLet's group the constants `R`, `c`, and `τ` into a single constant `K = R / (cτ)`, since these values do not change between the two scenarios. The formula simplifies to:\n`f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n### **2.

This law is expressed in terms of the particle's own time, known as the proper time (`t_p`). The formula is:\n        `f = N/N₀ = exp(-t_p / τ)`\n        where `τ` is the mean proper lifetime of the particle.\n\n    *   **Special Relativity (Time Dilation):** A particle moving at a relativistic speed experiences time more slowly than a stationary observer. The time measured in the lab's frame (`t_lab`) is related to the proper time (`t_p`) by the Lorentz factor (`γ`):\n        `t_lab = γ * t_p`\n        This means the time that passes for the particle is `t_p = t_lab / γ`.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Equations for the System:**\n    *   The particles travel a distance `R` (the detector radius) in the lab frame.\n    *   Since they are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`.\n    *   The time of flight in the lab frame is `t_lab = R / v ≈ R / c`.\n    *   Now, we can find the proper time experienced by the particle during its journey:\n        `t_p = t_lab / γ = (R / c) / γ = R / (γ * c)`\n    *   Substitute this expression for `t_p` into the decay formula to get the survival fraction `f` as a function of `γ`:\n        `f = exp(- (R / (γ * c)) / τ ) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n3.  **Set Up a Ratio for the Two Scenarios:**\n    *   Let's define a constant `K = R / (c * τ)`. This constant combines the detector's size and the particle's intrinsic lifetime, which do not change between the two scenarios. The survival equation simplifies to:\n        `f = exp(-K / γ)`\n    *   To solve for `γ`, we can first isolate the constant `K`. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives:\n        `ln(f) = -K / γ`\n        `K = -γ * ln(f)`\n    *   Since `K` is the same for both scenarios, we can set the expressions for `K` from each scenario equal to each other:\n        `-γ₁ * ln(f₁) = -γ₂ * ln(f₂)`\n\n4.  **Solve for the Unknown Lorentz Factor (`γ₂`):**\n    *   We are given:\n        *   Scenario 1: `γ₁ = 20`, `f₁ = 1/3`\n        *   Scenario 2: `γ₂ = ?`, `f₂ = 2/3`\n    *   Plug these values into the equation:\n        `-20 * ln(1/3) = -γ₂ * ln(2/3)`\n    *   The negative signs cancel out:\n        `20 * ln(1/3) = γ₂ * ln(2/3)`\n    *   Solve for `γ₂`:\n        `γ₂ = 20 * (ln(1/3) / ln(2/3))`\n    *   Using the logarithm properties `ln(1/x) = -ln(x)` and `ln(x/y) = ln(x) - ln(y)`:\n        `γ₂ = 20 * (-ln(3)) / (ln(2) - ln(3))`\n        `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n        `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    *   Now, we can compute the value of `γ₂` using a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# We derived the formula for the new Lorentz factor: gamma_2 = 20 * ln(3) / ln(1.5)\ngamma_2 = 20 * math.log(3) / math.log(1.5)\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\n<execute_code>\nimport math\n\n# We derived the formula for the new Lorentz factor: gamma_2 = 20 * ln(3) / ln(1.5)\ngamma_2 = 20 * math.log(3) / math.log(1.5)\nprint(gamma_2)\n</execute_code>\n<code_output>\n54.18839183013329\n</code_output>\nThe calculated value for the new Lorentz factor is approximately 54.19.

Let's break down the physics and derive the relationship.\n\n**1. Physics Background**\n\n*   **Particle Decay:** The number of particles, N, that survive after a time t in their own rest frame is given by the exponential decay law: $N(t) = N_0 e^{-t/\\tau_0}$, where $N_0$ is the initial number of particles and $\\tau_0$ is the proper mean lifetime.\n*   **Time Dilation:** From the perspective of the laboratory (the detector), the lifetime of a fast-moving particle is dilated. The lab-frame lifetime, $\\tau_{lab}$, is related to the proper lifetime by the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$: $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n*   **Travel Time:** The particles are ultra-relativistic, meaning their speed $v$ is very close to the speed of light, $c$. The time it takes for a particle to travel the detector radius, $R$, in the lab frame is $t_{lab} \\approx R/c$.\n\n**2. Deriving the Formula**\n\nThe fraction of particles, $f$, that survive the journey to the detector wall is given by the decay law using the time and lifetime measured in the lab frame:\n$f = \\frac{N}{N_0} = e^{-t_{lab}/\\tau_{lab}}$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $t_{lab}$ and $\\tau_{lab}$:\n$f = e^{-(R/c) / (\\gamma \\tau_0)} = e^{-R / (c \\gamma \\tau_0)}$\n\nTo simplify, let's take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$\\ln(f) = -\\frac{R}{c \\gamma \\tau_0}$\n\nRearranging the equation gives:\n$\\gamma \\ln(f) = -\\frac{R}{c \\tau_0}$\n\nSince $R$, $c$, and $\\tau_0$ are constants for this experiment, the entire right side is a constant. This means the product $\\gamma \\ln(f)$ is constant. We can also write this as $\\gamma \\ln(1/f)$ being constant.\n\n**3. Applying the Conditions**\n\nWe have two scenarios:\n\n*   **Condition 1:** $\\gamma_1 = 20$, $f_1 = 1/3$\n*   **Condition 2:** $\\gamma_2 = ?$, $f_2 = 2/3$\n\nSince the product $\\gamma \\ln(1/f)$ is constant, we can set the values from both conditions equal to each other:\n$\\gamma_1 \\ln(1/f_1) = \\gamma_2 \\ln(1/f_2)$\n\n**4.

This law must account for time dilation, where the particle's internal clock runs slower. The formula is:\n    `f = exp(-t / (γ * τ))`\n    where:\n    *   `t` is the time of flight in the detector's frame.\n    *   `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   `τ` (tau) is the proper mean lifetime of the particle (its lifetime in its own rest frame).\n\n2.  **Time of Flight**: The particles travel from the center to the wall of the spherical detector, a distance equal to the radius `R = 30 m`. Since they are moving at ultra-relativistic velocities, their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light, `c`. Therefore, the time of flight `t` is:\n    `t ≈ R / c = 30 / c`\n\n3.  **Setting up the Ratios**: Let's analyze the two scenarios given in the problem. The term `(R/c) / τ` is a constant for this specific particle and detector setup. Let's call this constant `K`.

The key concepts are:\n    *   **Exponential Decay:** The number of particles `N` that survive after a time `t` is given by `N(t) = N0 * exp(-t / τ_lab)`, where `N0` is the initial number of particles and `τ_lab` is the particle's lifetime in the lab frame.\n    *   **Time Dilation:** The lifetime of a moving particle (`τ_lab`) is longer than its lifetime when at rest (its proper lifetime `τ`). This is described by the equation `τ_lab = γ * τ`, where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   **Relativistic Travel Time:** The particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" meaning their speed `v` is very close to the speed of light, `c`. The time it takes for them to travel a distance `d` (the detector radius) is `t = d / v ≈ d / c`.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Equation:** We can combine these concepts. The fraction of particles reaching the detector is `N/N0`.\n    *   `N/N0 = exp(-t / τ_lab)`\n    *   Substitute `t = d/c` and `τ_lab = γ * τ`:\n    *   `N/N0 = exp(-(d/c) / (γ * τ)) = exp(-d / (γ * τ * c))`\n    *   The term `τ * c` is a constant for this type of particle, representing its proper lifetime multiplied by the speed of light. Let's call this constant `K`.\n    *   So, the main equation is: `Fraction = exp(-d / (γ * K))`\n\n3.  **Use the First Case to Find the Constant `K`:**\n    *   We are given: `d = 30` m, `γ1 = 20`, and `Fraction1 = 1/3`.\n    *   `1/3 = exp(-30 / (20 * K))`\n    *   By taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we can solve for `K`.\n    *   `ln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * K)`\n    *   `-ln(3) = -1.5 / K`\n    *   `K = 1.5 / ln(3)`\n\n4.  **Use the Second Case to Find the New Lorentz Factor `γ2`:**\n    *   Now we want to find `γ2` when `Fraction2 = 2/3`. We use the same equation and the value of `K` we just found.\n    *   `2/3 = exp(-30 / (γ2 * K))`\n    *   `ln(2/3) = -30 / (γ2 * K)`\n    *   `γ2 = -30 / (K * ln(2/3))`\n    *   Substitute the expression for `K`:\n    *   `γ2 = -30 / ((1.5 / ln(3)) * ln(2/3))`\n    *   `γ2 = (-30 / 1.5) * (ln(3) / ln(2/3))`\n    *   `γ2 = -20 * (ln(3) / (ln(2) - ln(3)))`\n    *   `γ2 = 20 * (ln(3) / (ln(3) - ln(2)))`\n    *   Alternatively, using `ln(2/3) = -ln(1.5)`:\n    *   `γ2 = 20 * ln(3) / ln(1.5)`\n    *   We will calculate this value using Python.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given Information ---\n# Case 1\ngamma1 = 20\nfraction1 = 1/3\n\n# Case 2\nfraction2 = 2/3\n\n# --- Calculation ---\n# The survival fraction equation is: fraction = exp(-d / (gamma * tau_c))\n# where d is distance, gamma is Lorentz factor, and tau_c is a constant (proper lifetime * c).\n# Rearranging the formula: ln(fraction) = -d / (gamma * tau_c)\n# We can form a ratio to eliminate the unknown constants d and tau_c:\n# ln(fraction1) / ln(fraction2) = [-d / (gamma1 * tau_c)] / [-d / (gamma2 * tau_c)]\n# ln(fraction1) / ln(fraction2) = gamma2 / gamma1\n# So, gamma2 = gamma1 * (ln(fraction1) / ln(fraction2))\n\n# Substitute the values\n# Note: log(1/3) is -log(3) and log(2/3) is -log(1.5)\n# The negative signs cancel out.\ngamma2 = gamma1 * (math.log(3) / math.log(1.5))\n\n\n# --- Output the result and the choices ---\nprint(f\"The Lorentz factor required for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector is: {gamma2:.2f}\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing this result with the given options:\")\nprint(\"A) 28\")\nprint(\"B) 54\")\nprint(\"C) 40\")\nprint(\"D) 68\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value is approximately 54.19, which corresponds to option B.\")\n\n<<<B>>>\n```\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: \nErrors:   File \"<stdin>\", line 35\n    <<<B>>>\n    ^^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Physics Principles\nThe problem involves the decay of relativistic particles. The key concepts are:\n1.  **Radioactive Decay:** The number of particles, N, that have not decayed after a time `t` is given by the exponential decay law: `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t/τ_proper)`, where `N₀` is the initial number of particles and `τ_proper` is the mean proper lifetime (the lifetime in the particle's own rest frame).\n2.  **Special Relativity (Time Dilation):** A moving particle's internal \"clock\" runs slower as observed from a stationary frame (the lab/detector frame). The mean lifetime of the particle as measured in the lab frame (`τ_lab`) is related to its proper lifetime (`τ_proper`) by the Lorentz factor (`γ`): `τ_lab = γ * τ_proper`.\n3.  **Travel Time:** The particles are created at the center and travel to the inner wall of the detector. The distance they travel is the radius `R`. Since they move at ultra-relativistic velocities, their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. The time taken for this journey in the lab frame is `t_lab = R / v ≈ R / c`.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Governing Equation\nThe fraction of particles that survive the journey to the detector wall is `N(t_lab) / N₀`. The time `t` in the decay law must be the time elapsed in the lab frame, `t_lab`, but the lifetime `τ` must be the lifetime as observed in the lab frame, `τ_lab`.\n\nFraction surviving, `F = N(t_lab) / N₀ = exp(-t_lab / τ_lab)`\n\nNow, substitute the expressions for `t_lab` and `τ_lab`:\n*   `t_lab ≈ R / c`\n*   `τ_lab = γ * τ_proper`\n\nSo, the fraction of particles reaching the detector is:\n`F = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ_proper))`\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Two Scenarios\n\nLet's define a constant `K = (R / c) / τ_proper`. This constant depends on the detector's radius and the particle's intrinsic properties, which do not change between the two scenarios.\nThe equation simplifies to: `F = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n**Scenario 1:**\n*   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`\n*   Fraction surviving, `F₁ = 1/3`\n\nPlugging these values into our equation:\n`1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n\nTo solve for `K`, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n`ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n`-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n`K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n*   Lorentz factor, `γ₂ = ?` (This is what we need to find)\n*   Fraction surviving, `F₂ = 2/3`\n\nPlugging these values into the same equation:\n`2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n\nAgain, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`\n`-ln(3/2) = -K / γ₂`\n`K = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\n### Step 4: Solve for the Unknown Lorentz Factor (γ₂)\nWe now have two expressions for the same constant `K`. We can set them equal to each other:\n`20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\nNow, we can isolate `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))`\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Final Value\nLet's use the approximate values for the natural logarithms:\n*   `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986`\n*   `ln(3/2) = ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`\n\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.7095`\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\nThis value is approximately 54.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n*   The actual radius of the detector (30 m) and the speed of light (c) are not needed for the final calculation because they are part of a constant factor that gets canceled out.\n*   The \"ultra-relativistic\" approximation (`v ≈ c`) is crucial and simplifies the travel time calculation.\n*   The distinction between proper time (`τ_proper`) and lab time (`τ_lab`) is the core of the problem. Time dilation is what allows more particles to reach the detector at higher energies (higher γ).\n*   To get a larger fraction of particles to survive, they need to experience less time decay from the lab's perspective. This is achieved by increasing the time dilation effect, which requires a higher Lorentz factor `γ`. Our result `γ₂ > γ₁` is consistent with this physical intuition.\n\nThe calculated value of `γ₂` is approximately 54, which matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nThis problem requires understanding the concepts of special relativity, specifically time dilation, and how it affects particle decay.\n\n**1. The Physics of Particle Decay**\n\nThe fraction of particles ($f$) that survive after a certain proper time ($\\tau$) is given by the exponential decay law:\n$f = N/N_0 = e^{-\\tau/\\tau_0}$\nwhere $\\tau_0$ is the mean proper lifetime of the particle (its lifetime in its own rest frame).\n\n**2. Time Dilation in the Lab Frame**\n\nThe particles are moving at relativistic speeds relative to the detector (the lab frame). Due to time dilation, the time elapsed in the particle's rest frame ($\\tau$) is shorter than the time measured in the lab frame ($t$). The relationship is:\n$\\tau = t / \\gamma$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n**3. Time of Flight**\n\nThe time it takes for a particle to travel the radius $R$ of the detector in the lab frame is $t = R/v$. Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their speed $v$ is approximately the speed of light, $c$.\nSo, $t \\approx R/c$.\n\n**4. Combining the Concepts**\n\nWe can substitute the expressions for $t$ and $\\tau$ into the decay equation:\n*   First, find the proper time elapsed for a particle reaching the wall:\n    $\\tau = t / \\gamma \\approx (R/c) / \\gamma = R / (\\gamma c)$\n*   Now, substitute this proper time into the decay formula:\n    $f = e^{-\\tau/\\tau_0} = e^{-R / (\\gamma c \\tau_0)}$\n\n**5. Setting up the Ratios**\n\nThe term $R/(c\\tau_0)$ is a constant for this specific particle and detector setup. Let's call this constant $K$. The equation becomes:\n$f = e^{-K/\\gamma}$\n\nTo solve for $K$, we can take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$\\ln(f) = -K/\\gamma$\n$-\\ln(f) = K/\\gamma$\n$\\ln(1/f) = K/\\gamma$\n$\\gamma \\ln(1/f) = K$\n\nSince $K$ is constant, we can equate this expression for the two scenarios given in the problem:\n$\\gamma_1 \\ln(1/f_1) = \\gamma_2 \\ln(1/f_2)$\n\n**6. Solving for the Unknown Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma_2$)**\n\nWe are given:\n*   Scenario 1: $\\gamma_1 = 20$, $f_1 = 1/3$\n*   Scenario 2: We want to find $\\gamma_2$ when $f_2 = 2/3$.\n\nPlug these values into the equation:\n$20 \\times \\ln(1 / (1/3)) = \\gamma_2 \\times \\ln(1 / (2/3))$\n$20 \\times \\ln(3) = \\gamma_2 \\times \\ln(3/2)$\n$20 \\times \\ln(3) = \\gamma_2 \\times \\ln(1.5)$\n\nNow, isolate $\\gamma_2$:\n$\\gamma_2 = 20 \\times \\frac{\\ln(3)}{\\ln(1.5)}$\n\n**7. Calculation**\n\nUsing the output from the code interpreter:\n$\\gamma_2 \\approx 54.19$\n\nThis value is very close to 54.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nThe problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and its effect on particle decay.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Understand the particle decay formula in the lab frame.**\n    The fraction of particles, N/N₀, that survive after a time `t` in the lab frame is given by the exponential decay law:\n    N/N₀ = exp(-t / τ_lab)\n    where:\n    *   N is the number of particles remaining.\n    *   N₀ is the initial number of particles.\n    *   `t` is the time of flight in the lab frame.\n    *   τ_lab is the average lifetime of the particle in the lab frame.\n\n2.  **Relate lab frame quantities to the problem's parameters.**\n    *   The time of flight `t` for a particle to reach the detector wall of radius `R` (30 m) at a velocity `v` is `t = R/v`. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic (v ≈ c, the speed of light), we can approximate `t ≈ R/c`.\n    *   The particle's lifetime in the lab frame, τ_lab, is dilated due to its high speed. It is related to its proper lifetime τ (the lifetime in its own rest frame) by the Lorentz factor γ: τ_lab = γτ.\n\n3.  **Combine the formulas.**\n    Substituting these into the decay equation gives the survival fraction:\n    N/N₀ = exp(-(R/c) / (γτ)) = exp(-R / (γcτ))\n\n4.  **Use the initial conditions to find the constant `cτ`.**\n    We are given that for the first scenario:\n    *   Survival fraction (N₁/N₀) = 1/3\n    *   Lorentz factor (γ₁) = 20\n    *   Radius (R) = 30 m\n\n    Plugging these values into the equation:\n    1/3 = exp(-30 / (20 * cτ))\n\n    To solve for `cτ`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    ln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * cτ)\n    -ln(3) = -1.5 / (cτ)\n    ln(3) = 1.5 / (cτ)\n\n    This gives us a relationship for the constant term `cτ`: `cτ = 1.5 / ln(3)`. We don't need to calculate its exact value yet.\n\n5.  **Use the target conditions to find the new Lorentz factor (γ₂).**\n    For the second scenario, we want:\n    *   Survival fraction (N₂/N₀) = 2/3\n    *   Radius (R) = 30 m\n\n    We need to find the new Lorentz factor, γ₂. Using the same survival equation:\n    2/3 = exp(-30 / (γ₂ * cτ))\n\n    Again, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    ln(2/3) = -30 / (γ₂ * cτ)\n    -ln(3/2) = -30 / (γ₂ * cτ)\n    ln(3/2) = 30 / (γ₂ * cτ)\n\n6.  **Solve for γ₂.**\n    We can now set up a ratio between the two scenarios to eliminate the constant `cτ`.\n    From step 4: `ln(3) = 1.5 / cτ`\n    From step 5: `ln(3/2) = 30 / (γ₂ * cτ)`\n\n    Let's rearrange both to isolate `cτ`:\n    `cτ = 1.5 / ln(3)`\n    `cτ = 30 / (γ₂ * ln(3/2))`\n\n    Now, set the two expressions for `cτ` equal to each other:\n    1.5 / ln(3) = 30 / (γ₂ * ln(3/2))\n\n    Now, solve for γ₂:\n    γ₂ * ln(3/2) * 1.5 = 30 * ln(3)\n    γ₂ = (30 * ln(3)) / (1.5 * ln(3/2))\n    γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)\n\n    Using the approximate values for the natural logarithms (ln(3) ≈ 1.0986 and ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055):\n    γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)\n    γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709\n    γ₂ ≈ 54.18\n\nThis value is approximately 54.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nTo determine the necessary Lorentz factor, we can use the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and the law of radioactive decay.\n\n### Analysis of the Physics\n\nThe fraction of particles that survive after traveling a certain distance depends on their lifetime.

The time it takes for them to reach the detector's inner wall (a distance R = 30 m) in the laboratory's frame of reference is `t_lab = R / v`. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic (γ >> 1), their velocity 'v' is extremely close to the speed of light 'c'. Therefore, we can approximate `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n\n3.  **Time Dilation**: Due to relativistic effects, the lifetime of a moving particle as observed from the lab frame (τ_lab) is longer than its proper lifetime (τ_proper). This is known as time dilation. The relationship is given by `τ_lab = γ * τ_proper`, where γ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n4.  **Survival Probability**: The fraction of particles reaching the detector is the probability of a particle surviving for the time `t_lab`.

This effect is called time dilation and is described by the equation:\n    `τ_lab = γ * τ₀`\n    where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n\n*   **Time of Flight:** The particles are created at the center of a spherical detector of radius `R = 30 m`. Since they travel at ultra-relativistic velocities, their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light, `c`. The time it takes for them to reach the detector wall is:\n    `t = R / v ≈ R / c`\n\n**2. Combine the equations:**\n\nWe can substitute the expressions for `τ_lab` and `t` into the decay equation:\n`f = exp(-(R / c) / (γ * τ₀))`\n\nLet's group the constant terms. For a given type of particle (`τ₀` is constant) and a given detector (`R` is constant), the term `R / (c * τ₀)` is a constant. Let's call this constant `K`.\n`K = R / (c * τ₀)`\n\nThe equation simplifies to:\n`f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n**3. Use the given information to solve for the unknown:**\n\nWe have two scenarios:\n\n*   **Scenario 1:**\n    *   Fraction surviving, `f₁ = 1/3`\n    *   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`\n    *   Plugging these values in: `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n\n*   **Scenario 2:**\n    *   Fraction surviving, `f₂ = 2/3`\n    *   Lorentz factor, `γ₂ = ?` (this is what we need to find)\n    *   Plugging these values in: `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n\nWe can solve for `K` from Scenario 1 by taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n`-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n`K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\nNow, we use this expression for `K` in the equation for Scenario 2. First, take the logarithm of the equation for Scenario 2:\n`ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`\n`γ₂ = -K / ln(2/3)`\n\nSubstitute the expression for `K`:\n`γ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / ln(2/3)`\n\nUsing the logarithm property `ln(a/b) = ln(a) - ln(b)` and `ln(a/b) = -ln(b/a)`:\n`γ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / -ln(3/2)`\n`γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n**4. Calculate the final value:**\n\nNow we compute the numerical value for `γ₂`.\n`ln(3) ≈ 1.0986`\n`ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`\n\n`γ₂ = 20 * 1.0986 / 0.4055 ≈ 54.19`\n\nThe calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2.\n\n**5.

The fraction of particles that survive after a certain time is governed by the principles of special relativity (time dilation) and radioactive decay.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Particle Decay Law:** The number of particles `N` remaining after a time `t` from an initial population `N₀` is given by the exponential decay formula:\n    `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / T)`\n    where `T` is the mean lifetime of the particles in the frame of reference where time `t` is measured (in this case, the lab frame).\n\n2.  **Time Dilation:** The lifetime `T` of a particle moving with a Lorentz factor `γ` as measured in the lab frame is dilated compared to its proper lifetime `τ₀` (its lifetime in its own rest frame). The relationship is:\n    `T = γ * τ₀`\n\n3.  **Combining Equations:** By substituting the time-dilated lifetime into the decay law, we get the decay equation in terms of the proper lifetime:\n    `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / (γ * τ₀))`\n\n4.  **Time of Flight:** The particles are produced at the center of a spherical detector with a radius `R = 30 m`. They travel at ultra-relativistic velocities, meaning their speed `v` is very close to the speed of light `c`. The time it takes for them to reach the detector wall in the lab frame is:\n    `t_flight = R / v ≈ R / c`\n\n5.  **Fraction of Surviving Particles:** The fraction `f` of particles that reach the detector is the ratio of the number of particles that haven't decayed by `t_flight` to the initial number `N₀`:\n    `f = N(t_flight) / N₀ = exp(-t_flight / (γ * τ₀))`\n    Substituting `t_flight = R/c`, we get:\n    `f = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ₀))`\n\n6.  **Applying the Scenarios:** We are given two scenarios. The term `R / (c * τ₀)` is a constant for a given particle and detector setup. Let's call this constant `K`. The formula simplifies to `f = exp(-K / γ)`.\n\n    *   **Scenario 1:** `γ₁ = 20` and `f₁ = 1/3`.\n        `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n\n    *   **Scenario 2:** We need to find `γ₂` for `f₂ = 2/3`.\n        `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n\n7.  **Solving for γ₂:** We can solve this system of equations. First, let's find the constant `K` from Scenario 1 by taking the natural logarithm (`ln`) of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n    `-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n    `K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n    Now, substitute this value of `K` into the equation for Scenario 2:\n    `2/3 = exp(-(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂)`\n\n    Again, take the natural logarithm of both sides to solve for `γ₂`:\n    `ln(2/3) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n    `-ln(3/2) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n    `ln(1.5) = (20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n\n    Finally, rearrange the equation to solve for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(1.5)`\n\n8.  **Calculation:** We can now compute the value of `γ₂`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Derived formula for the new Lorentz factor (gamma2)\n# gamma2 = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(1.5)\n\ngamma2 = (20 * math.log(3)) / math.log(1.5)\n\nprint(gamma2)\n```\n<execute_result>\n54.1895848386183\n</execute_result>\nThe calculation shows that the required Lorentz factor is approximately 54.19.

The survival probability of a particle traveling a certain distance depends on its speed, or more precisely, its Lorentz factor (γ).\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Understanding Particle Decay:** The decay of unstable particles is an exponential process. The fraction of particles, P, that survive after a time *t* in their own rest frame is given by P = e^(-t/τ), where τ is the proper mean lifetime of the particle.\n\n2.  **Time Dilation:** According to special relativity, time for a moving particle, as observed from a stationary frame (the lab frame), appears to run slower. This effect is called time dilation. The particle's lifetime in the lab frame (t') is dilated by the Lorentz factor, γ: t' = γτ. This means the particle's average decay length in the lab is L = vγτ, where v is its velocity.\n\n3.  **Applying to the Problem:**\n    *   The particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" so their velocity *v* is approximately the speed of light, *c*.\n    *   The time it takes to travel from the center to the detector wall (a distance R = 30 m) in the lab frame is t_lab = R/v ≈ R/c.\n    *   The survival probability, P, is the probability that the particle survives for at least the time t_lab. This is given by the formula P = e^(-t_lab / t') = e^(-(R/c) / (γτ)).\n\n4.  **Setting up the Equations:** We have two scenarios:\n\n    *   **Scenario 1:** Lorentz factor γ₁ = 20, and the survival fraction P₁ = 1/3.\n        1/3 = e^(-R / (γ₁cτ)) = e^(-30 / (20cτ))\n\n    *   **Scenario 2:** A new Lorentz factor γ₂ is needed for a survival fraction P₂ = 2/3.\n        2/3 = e^(-R / (γ₂cτ)) = e^(-30 / (γ₂cτ))\n\n5.  **Solving for the Unknown Lorentz Factor (γ₂):** To solve for γ₂, we can take the natural logarithm of both equations:\n\n    *   ln(1/3) = -30 / (20cτ)  =>  -ln(3) = -30 / (20cτ)  =>  ln(3) = 1.5 / (cτ)\n    *   ln(2/3) = -30 / (γ₂cτ)  =>  -ln(3/2) = -30 / (γ₂cτ) => ln(3/2) = 30 / (γ₂cτ)\n\n    Now, we can create a ratio of the two results to eliminate the unknown particle lifetime (τ) and the speed of light (c):\n\n    (ln(3)) / (ln(3/2)) = (1.5 / cτ) / (30 / (γ₂cτ))\n    (ln(3)) / (ln(3/2)) = (1.5 * γ₂) / 30\n    (ln(3)) / (ln(3/2)) = γ₂ / 20\n\n    Finally, we solve for γ₂:\n\n    γ₂ = 20 * [ln(3) / ln(3/2)]\n    γ₂ ≈ 20 * [1.0986 / 0.4055]\n    γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709\n    γ₂ ≈ 54.18\n\nThis result is very close to 54.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the final answer.\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:** The problem involves two key concepts: particle decay and relativistic time dilation.\n    *   **Particle Decay:** The fraction of particles, `N/N₀`, that survive after a time `t` is given by the exponential decay law: `N/N₀ = exp(-t / τ_lab)`, where `τ_lab` is the average lifetime of the particles in the laboratory's frame of reference.\n    *   **Time Dilation:** An unstable particle's lifetime appears longer when it is moving at a relativistic speed relative to an observer.

Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. So, `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n\n4.  **Combine Equations:** Substituting these into the decay law, we get:\n    `N/N₀ = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ)) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n    The term `R / (c * τ)` is a constant for a given particle type and detector size.\n\n5.  **Solve for the Unknown:**\n    *   First, we use the initial data (`γ₁ = 20`, `N/N₀ = 1/3`) to find this constant.

The key concepts are:\n1.  **Radioactive Decay:** The number of undecayed particles `N` from an initial population `N₀` after a time `t` is given by the exponential decay law: `N(t) = N₀ * e^(-t/τ_lifetime)`.\n2.  **Special Relativity (Time Dilation):** A particle moving with a Lorentz factor `γ` has its internal \"clock\" slowed down from the perspective of a stationary observer (the lab frame). Its lifetime in the lab frame (`τ_lab`) is longer than its lifetime in its own rest frame (the proper lifetime `τ`). The relationship is `τ_lab = γτ`.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Governing Equation\nLet's express the survival fraction `N/N₀` in terms of the given parameters.\n*   The time it takes for a particle to travel from the center to the detector wall (a distance `R`) in the lab frame is `t_lab`. Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic\", their speed `v` is very close to the speed of light `c`. So, we can approximate `t_lab ≈ R/c`.\n*   The decay law, when viewed from the lab frame, uses the time elapsed in the lab frame (`t_lab`) and the particle's lifetime as measured in the lab frame (`τ_lab`).\n    `N/N₀ = e^(-t_lab / τ_lab)`\n*   Substituting the expressions for `t_lab` and `τ_lab`:\n    `N/N₀ = e^(-(R/c) / (γτ))`\n    This can be rewritten as:\n    `N/N₀ = e^(-R / (γcτ))`\n    Here, `R` is the detector radius, `γ` is the Lorentz factor, and `cτ` is a constant value for this specific type of particle (its mean decay length in its rest frame).\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the First Scenario\nWe are given the following information for the first scenario:\n*   Detector Radius `R = 30 m`\n*   Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`\n*   Survival fraction `N₁/N₀ = 1/3`\n\nLet's plug these into our equation:\n`1/3 = e^(-30 / (20 * cτ))`\n\nTo solve for the unknown `cτ`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * cτ)`\n`-ln(3) = -1.5 / (cτ)`\n`ln(3) = 1.5 / (cτ)` **(Equation 1)**\n\nThis equation contains all the information from the first scenario. We don't need to calculate the value of `cτ` yet.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Second Scenario\nNow we want to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`, that results in a different survival fraction.\n*   Required survival fraction `N₂/N₀ = 2/3`\n*   The radius `R` and the particle property `cτ` remain the same.\n\nThe equation for the second scenario is:\n`2/3 = e^(-30 / (γ₂ * cτ))`\n\nAgain, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(2/3) = -30 / (γ₂ * cτ)`\n`ln(2) - ln(3) = -30 / (γ₂ * cτ)`\n`-(ln(3) - ln(2)) = -30 / (γ₂ * cτ)`\n`ln(3/2) = 30 / (γ₂ * cτ)` **(Equation 2)**\n\n### Step 5: Solve for the new Lorentz factor `γ₂`\nWe now have a system of two equations. A simple way to solve this is to take the ratio of Equation 1 and Equation 2.\n\nDivide Equation 1 by Equation 2:\n`(ln(3)) / (ln(3/2)) = (1.5 / cτ) / (30 / (γ₂ * cτ))`\n\nThe `cτ` terms cancel out:\n`ln(3) / ln(3/2) = (1.5) * (γ₂ / 30)`\n`ln(3) / ln(3/2) = γ₂ / 20`\n\nNow, solve for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))`\n\n### Step 6: Calculate the Final Value\nUsing the approximate values for the natural logarithms:\n*   `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986`\n*   `ln(3/2) = ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`\n\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\nThis value is extremely close to 54.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n*   **Time Dilation:** The core of the problem is correctly applying the time dilation formula `τ_lab = γτ` to the lifetime of the particle. The time of flight `t_lab` is measured in the lab frame, so the lifetime must also be expressed in the lab frame for the decay equation to be consistent.\n*   **Constant Properties:** It is essential to recognize that the particle's proper lifetime `τ` (and thus `cτ`) is an intrinsic property and does not change between the two scenarios. The detector radius `R` is also constant. The only variables are the Lorentz factor `γ` and the survival fraction `N/N₀`.\n*   **Logarithm Rules:** Correct application of logarithm rules, such as `ln(1/x) = -ln(x)` and `ln(a/b) = ln(a) - ln(b)`, is crucial for correctly setting up the final algebraic expression.\n\nBased on the calculation, the required Lorentz factor is approximately 54.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nThe thinking process and the code execution are correct.

So, `t ≈ R/c`.\n\nNow we can write the fraction of surviving particles, `N/N₀`, as:\n`N/N₀ = e^(-R / (c * γ * τ₀))`\n\nLet's analyze the two given scenarios:\n\n**Scenario 1:**\n-   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`\n-   Fraction of surviving particles, `N/N₀ = 1/3`\n\nPlugging these values into the equation:\n`1/3 = e^(-R / (c * 20 * τ₀))`\n\nTo solve for the unknown term `R/(c*τ₀)`, we can take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(1/3) = -R / (c * 20 * τ₀)`\n`-ln(3) = -R / (c * 20 * τ₀)`\n`ln(3) = R / (c * 20 * τ₀)`\n\nFrom this, we can find the value of the constant term `R/(c*τ₀)`:\n`R / (c * τ₀) = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n-   Fraction of surviving particles, `N/N₀ = 2/3`\n-   We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`.\n\nPlugging these values into the general equation:\n`2/3 = e^(-R / (c * γ₂ * τ₀))`\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(2/3) = -R / (c * γ₂ * τ₀)`\n`ln(2) - ln(3) = -R / (c * γ₂ * τ₀)`\n`-(ln(3) - ln(2)) = -R / (c * γ₂ * τ₀)`\n`ln(3/2) = R / (c * γ₂ * τ₀)`\n\nNow we can solve for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = (R / (c * τ₀)) / ln(3/2)`\n\nWe can now substitute the expression for `R/(c*τ₀)` that we found in Scenario 1:\n`γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)`\n`γ₂ = (20 * 1.0986) / 0.4055`\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\nThis value is approximately 54.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nThe problem requires us to determine the Lorentz factor (`γ`) needed for a certain fraction of particles to survive a journey to a detector wall. This involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation, and the law of radioactive decay.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Fundamental Principles:**\n    *   **Exponential Decay:** The number of particles `N` remaining from an initial population `N₀` after a time `t` is given by `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / τ_lab)`, where `τ_lab` is the mean lifetime of the particles as observed in the laboratory frame.\n    *   **Time Dilation:** Due to relativistic effects, a particle moving with a Lorentz factor `γ` has its lifetime dilated in the lab frame. If its proper lifetime (in its own rest frame) is `τ`, the lab-frame lifetime is `τ_lab = γ * τ`.\n\n2.  **Survival Fraction Formula:**\n    The fraction of particles that survive, `f = N/N₀`, can be expressed by substituting the time dilation formula into the decay law:\n    `f = exp(-t / (γ * τ))`\n    The time `t` is the time of flight from the center to the detector wall in the lab frame. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic (`v ≈ c`), this time is `t ≈ R/c`, where `R` is the detector radius and `c` is the speed of light.\n    Therefore, the survival fraction is:\n    `f = exp(-R / (c * γ * τ))`\n\n3.  **Analyzing the Two Scenarios:**\n    Let's define a constant `K = R / (c * τ)`. This constant depends only on the detector's size and the intrinsic properties of the particle, not on its energy (or Lorentz factor). The formula simplifies to:\n    `f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n    *   **Scenario 1 (Initial Condition):**\n        We are given that when the Lorentz factor is `γ₁ = 20`, the survival fraction is `f₁ = 1/3`.\n        `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n        By taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we can solve for `K`:\n        `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n        `-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n        `K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n    *   **Scenario 2 (Desired Condition):**\n        We want to find the Lorentz factor `γ₂` that results in a survival fraction of `f₂ = 2/3`.\n        `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n        Again, taking the natural logarithm:\n        `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`\n        `-ln(3/2) = -K / γ₂`\n        `K = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\n4.  **Solving for the New Lorentz Factor (`γ₂`):**\n    We now have two expressions for the constant `K`, which we can set equal to each other:\n    `20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n    Solving for `γ₂`, we get:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n5.  **Numerical Calculation:**\n    The provided code output shows the result of calculating this expression:\n    `γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.19.

Here is the step-by-step derivation of the solution.\n\n### **1. The Physics of the Problem**\n\n*   **Exponential Decay:** The fraction, *f*, of particles that survive after a time *t* is given by the formula:\n    *f* = *N*/*N₀* = exp(-*t* / *τ*)\n    where *τ* is the mean lifetime of the particle in the reference frame where time *t* is measured.\n\n*   **Time Dilation:** The particles are moving at relativistic speeds. According to special relativity, their lifetime as measured in the lab's reference frame (*τ<sub>lab</sub>*) is longer than their intrinsic lifetime in their own rest frame (*τ<sub>proper</sub>*). This effect is called time dilation and is quantified by the Lorentz factor, *γ*:\n    *τ<sub>lab</sub>* = *γ* * *τ<sub>proper</sub>*\n    A higher Lorentz factor means the particle is moving faster and its observed lifetime is longer.\n\n### **2. Setting up the Equation**\n\n1.  **Time of Flight:** The particles travel from the center to the detector wall, a distance equal to the radius *R* = 30 m. Since they are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their speed *v* is approximately the speed of light, *c*. The time of flight in the lab frame is:\n    *t<sub>lab</sub>* = *R* / *v* ≈ *R* / *c*\n\n2.  **Survival Fraction:** The fraction of particles that reach the wall is determined by their decay over the time of flight, *t<sub>lab</sub>*, using their dilated lifetime, *τ<sub>lab</sub>*:\n    *f* = exp(-*t<sub>lab</sub>* / *τ<sub>lab</sub>*)\n\n3.  **Combining Equations:** Substitute the expressions for *t<sub>lab</sub>* and *τ<sub>lab</sub>*:\n    *f* = exp(-( *R* / *c* ) / ( *γ* * *τ<sub>proper</sub>* ))\n\n4.  **Simplifying:** Notice that *R*, *c*, and *τ<sub>proper</sub>* are all constants for this specific type of particle and experimental setup. We can group them into a single constant, let's call it *A*:\n    *A* = *R* / (*c* * *τ<sub>proper</sub>*)\n    The governing equation becomes:\n    *f* = exp(-*A* / *γ*)\n\n### **3.

This law must account for time dilation, a relativistic effect where time for a moving particle passes slower than for a stationary observer. The particle's lifetime in the lab frame (*t_lab*) is its proper lifetime (*τ*, the lifetime in its own rest frame) multiplied by the Lorentz factor (γ).\n\nThe formula for the fraction of particles remaining (N/N₀) after traveling a distance *R* at a velocity *v* is:\n\n**N/N₀ = e<sup>(-t / (γτ))</sup>**\n\nSince the particles are ultra-relativistic, their velocity *v* is approximately the speed of light, *c*.

This involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and the exponential decay law.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Survival Fraction Formula**: The fraction of particles (`f`) that survive after a time `t` in the laboratory's frame of reference is given by the relativistic decay formula. The decay is based on the particle's proper lifetime (`τ`), but the time it experiences is dilated. In the lab frame, the effective lifetime is `γτ`. The time of flight to the detector wall is `t = R/v`, where `R` is the detector radius and `v` is the particle's velocity. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, we can approximate their velocity `v` with the speed of light `c`, so `t ≈ R/c`.\n\n    The survival fraction is therefore:\n    `f = exp(-t / (γ * τ)) = exp(-R / (c * γ * τ))`\n\n2.  **Initial Condition**: We are given that when the Lorentz factor `γ₁` is 20, one-third of the particles reach the detector.\n    *   `f₁ = 1/3`\n    *   `γ₁ = 20`\n\n    Plugging these values into the formula:\n    `1/3 = exp(-R / (c * 20 * τ))`\n\n    To solve for the constant part of the exponent, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = -R / (20 * c * τ)`\n    `-ln(3) = -R / (20 * c * τ)`\n\n    This gives us a value for the constant term `k = R / (c * τ)`:\n    `k = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n3.  **Final Condition**: We need to find the new Lorentz factor `γ₂` that results in two-thirds of the particles reaching the detector.\n    *   `f₂ = 2/3`\n    *   `γ₂ = ?`\n\n    Using the same survival formula:\n    `2/3 = exp(-R / (c * γ₂ * τ)) = exp(-k / γ₂)`\n\n    Again, we take the natural logarithm:\n    `ln(2/3) = -k / γ₂`\n    `-ln(3/2) = -k / γ₂`\n    `ln(3/2) = k / γ₂`\n\n4.  **Calculate γ₂**: Now we can solve for `γ₂` and substitute the expression for `k` we found in step 2:\n    `γ₂ = k / ln(3/2)`\n    `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)`\n\n    Using the approximate values for the natural logarithms (`ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`):\n    `γ₂ ≈ (20 * 1.0986) / 0.4055`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\nThe calculated value of approximately 54.18 is closest to the option 54.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
