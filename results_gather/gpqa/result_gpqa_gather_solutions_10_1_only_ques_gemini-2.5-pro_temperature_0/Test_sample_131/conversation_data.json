There are also three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio. Which two compounds are present in the mixture from the following options: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\nA) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\nB) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene\nC) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\nD) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nThis problem requires us to deduce the structures of two compounds in a mixture by analyzing their combined 1H NMR spectrum. Let's break down the problem by analyzing the expected spectrum for each candidate compound and then see which pair matches the given data.\n\n**1. Analyze the Given Spectral Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** 1:1\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   This tells us that each compound in the mixture produces a single, sharp signal (a singlet) in the aromatic region.\n    *   The 1:1 ratio of these two signals means that the number of aromatic protons in compound A is equal to the number of aromatic protons in compound B (since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   These signals correspond to the methyl (or ethyl) groups attached to the aromatic rings.\n\n**2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nLet's check if the molecular formula C10H14 is correct for all options and predict their spectra.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Formula OK)\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C3 and C6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a **single singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups are all equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as a **single singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Formula OK)\n    *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry passes through C2 and C5.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a **single singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        *   The methyls at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyl at C2 is unique (3H).\n        *   The methyl at C5 is unique (3H).\n        *   This gives **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Formula OK)\n    *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are equivalent, but they are adjacent to each other. They will split each other, resulting in an AB quartet (or two doublets), **not a singlet**. This compound can be eliminated.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** C6H4(CH2CH3)2 = C10H14. (Formula OK)\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four protons on the ring are all equivalent. They will appear as a **single singlet (4H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The ethyl groups will show splitting: a quartet (4H) for the -CH2- groups and a triplet (6H) for the -CH3- groups. The problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets, so this compound can be eliminated.\n\n**3. Identify the Correct Pair of Compounds**\n\nBased on the analysis above, we can eliminate 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene. The only two remaining candidates that fit the aromatic signal description (producing a singlet) are **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\nLet's verify if a 1:1 mixture of these two compounds matches all the spectral data.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes a 2H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes a 2H singlet.\n    *   In a 1:1 mixture, this will result in **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This perfectly matches the data.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region:**\n    *   Let's consider the total number of aliphatic protons in the 1:1 mixture: 12H from the first compound + 12H from the second = 24H total.\n    *   The observed ratio is 2:1:1. The sum of the ratio parts is 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.\n    *   The actual integration for the three signals will be:\n        *   Signal 1: (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n        *   Signal 2: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n        *   Signal 3: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   Now let's see if our chosen pair can produce signals with these integrations:\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one singlet of **12H**. This matches our largest signal.\n        *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene provides three singlets of 6H, 3H, and 3H.\n        *   The 6H signal from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene can be our second signal.\n        *   For the third signal, we need an integration of 6H. This can be explained if the two 3H signals from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene accidentally have the same chemical shift and overlap, appearing as a single 6H peak. This is a common feature in NMR problems.\n    *   Therefore, the combined spectrum would show three aliphatic singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H, which gives the required **2:1:1 ratio**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that matches all the spectral data is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the two compounds in the mixture based on the provided 1H NMR data.\n\n### 1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. This indicates that the two compounds are in a 1:1 molar mixture, and each compound has only one type of aromatic proton (all aromatic protons on a given molecule are chemically equivalent). The 1:1 ratio of the signals confirms the 1:1 molar ratio of the compounds, as long as each compound has the same number of aromatic protons.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. These signals represent the combined methyl (or other alkyl) protons from both compounds in the mixture. All signals are singlets, meaning there is no splitting, which is characteristic of methyl groups not adjacent to any protons.\n\n### 2. Evaluate Each Compound Option\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 are all chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry passes through the C2 and C5 positions.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the one at C2, the one at C5, and the two equivalent ones at C1 and C3. This will produce **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 3H:3H:6H (or 1:1:2).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: the \"outer\" methyls (C1, C4) and the \"inner\" methyls (C2, C3). This will produce **two singlets**, each integrating to 6H, giving a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are all equivalent, producing **one singlet** for 4H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** This compound has ethyl groups, not just methyl groups. The spectrum would show a quartet (for the -CH2-) and a triplet (for the -CH3-), not just singlets. Therefore, this compound can be eliminated.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Mixture Options\n\nThe mixture must contain two compounds that each give a single peak in the aromatic region. All three tetramethylbenzene isomers fit this criterion. Since they each have 2 aromatic protons, a 1:1 mixture will correctly produce two aromatic singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n\nNow, we must find the combination whose alkyl signals add up to three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Combined alkyl signals: Two singlets (6H, 6H) from 1,2,3,4-TMB and three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H) from 1,2,3,5-TMB. This would result in up to five signals, which does not match the data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   Eliminated because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not give only singlets in the alkyl region.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Combined alkyl signals: One singlet (12H) from 1,2,4,5-TMB and three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H) from 1,2,3,5-TMB. This gives a total of four signals, which only matches the data if there is an accidental overlap of signals. To get a 2:1:1 ratio (which corresponds to 12H:6H:6H), the two 3H signals from 1,2,3,5-TMB would need to overlap, which is unlikely as they are in different chemical environments.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. A 1:1 mixture gives two 2H singlets, which is a 1:1 ratio. This matches the data.\n    *   **Alkyl signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H each).\n    *   **Combined alkyl signals:** The mixture will show three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   **Ratio:** The integration ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches the experimental data without needing to assume any accidental signal overlaps.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only option that perfectly accounts for all the features of the described 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Problem Statement:** First, we'll break down the information provided by the 1H NMR spectrum.\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n    *   **Mixture:** 1:1 ratio.\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. This implies the mixture contains two different compounds, and each compound contributes one aromatic singlet. Since the mixture is 1:1, the number of protons for each aromatic singlet must be the same.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. This is the combined signal from the aliphatic protons of both compounds in the mixture.\n\n2.  **Analyze Individual Candidate Compounds:** We will predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four options to see what signals they would produce on their own. We'll focus on the number of signals, their multiplicity (singlet, doublet, etc.), and their relative integration (number of protons).\n    *   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** Due to its high symmetry, it has one type of aromatic proton (2H) and one type of methyl group (12H). This gives 1 aromatic singlet (2H) and 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n    *   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** It has one plane of symmetry. This results in one type of aromatic proton (2H), and three different types of methyl groups (6H, 3H, 3H). This gives 1 aromatic singlet (2H) and 3 aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H, a 2:1:1 ratio).\n    *   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** It has one plane of symmetry. This results in one type of aromatic proton (2H) and two different types of methyl groups (6H, 6H). This gives 1 aromatic singlet (2H) and 2 aliphatic singlets (6H, 6H, a 1:1 ratio).\n    *   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has ethyl groups, which would produce quartets and triplets in the aliphatic region, not just singlets. Therefore, it can be eliminated from consideration.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Mixtures (Options A-D):** We will combine the predicted spectra for the pairs of compounds in each option (assuming a 1:1 mixture) and see which one matches the observed data.\n\n    *   **Aromatic Check:** A 1:1 mixture of any two of the tetramethylbenzene isomers will produce two 2H aromatic singlets, matching the observed 1:1 ratio. So, we must use the aliphatic region to distinguish them.\n    *   **Aliphatic Check:** We will sum the aliphatic signals for each pair and check if the result is three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n4.  **Code Implementation and Final Answer:** A Python script will be used to systematically perform the analysis described above and identify the correct option.\n\n```python\ndef solve_nmr_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes 1H NMR data for a mixture of two aromatic compounds to identify them.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the provided 1H NMR data for the 1:1 mixture.\")\n    print(\"  - Aromatic Region: 2 singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\")\n    print(\"  - Aliphatic Region: 3 singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # Step 2: Define the spectral characteristics of each candidate compound.\n    # The data is stored as: { \"aromatic_H\": count, \"aliphatic_integrations\": [list_of_H_counts] }\n    compounds = {\n        \"1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\": {\"aromatic_H\": 2, \"aliphatic_integrations\": [12]},\n        \"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\": {\"aromatic_H\": 2, \"aliphatic_integrations\": [6, 3, 3]},\n        \"1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\": {\"aromatic_H\": 2, \"aliphatic_integrations\": [6, 6]},\n        \"1,4-diethylbenzene\": {\"aromatic_H\": 4, \"aliphatic_integrations\": \"non-singlets\"}\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Predicted 1H NMR signals for individual compounds.\")\n    for name, data in compounds.items():\n        print(f\"  - {name}:\")\n        if isinstance(data[\"aliphatic_integrations\"], list):\n            print(f\"    - Aromatic: 1 singlet ({data['aromatic_H']}H)\")\n            print(f\"    - Aliphatic: {len(data['aliphatic_integrations'])} singlet(s) with integrations {data['aliphatic_integrations']}H\")\n        else:\n            print(\"    - Aliphatic signals are not all singlets, so this compound is excluded.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # Step 3: Define the options and evaluate them.\n    options = {\n        \"A\": (\"1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\"),\n        \"B\": (\"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,4-diethylbenzene\"),\n        \"C\": (\"1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\"),\n        \"D\": (\"1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\")\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Evaluating each option for a 1:1 mixture.\")\n    correct_option = None\n    for option, (name1, name2) in options.items():\n        print(f\"\\nTesting Option {option}: {name1} and {name2}\")\n        comp1 = compounds[name1]\n        comp2 = compounds[name2]\n\n        # Rule out any option with 1,4-diethylbenzene\n        if comp1[\"aliphatic_integrations\"] == \"non-singlets\" or comp2[\"aliphatic_integrations\"] == \"non-singlets\":\n            print(\"  - Result: FAILED.

The total number of carbons is 6 + 4 = 10. The total number of hydrogens is 2 + (4 * 3) = 14. The formula is C10H14. This applies to options 1, 2, and 3.\n*   **Diethylbenzene:** The formula is C6H4(C2H5)2. The total number of carbons is 6 + (2 * 2) = 10. The total number of hydrogens is 4 + (2 * 5) = 14. The formula is C10H14. This applies to option 4.\n*   **Conclusion:** All four compounds have the correct molecular formula.\n\n**Step 3: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nWe need to analyze the symmetry of each molecule to determine the number of unique proton environments.\n\n*   **1. 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical. There are two planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a **single singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent. They will appear as a **single singlet** with an integration of **12H**.\n    *   **Summary:** 2 signals total (one 2H aromatic singlet, one 12H alkyl singlet).\n\n*   **2. 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Less symmetrical. There is one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. They will appear as **two separate singlets**, each with an integration of **1H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct types of methyl groups:\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique (3H).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique (3H).\n        This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 5 signals total (two 1H aromatic singlets, three alkyl singlets with 2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **3. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Symmetrical. There is a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They are adjacent (ortho) to each other. While they would technically couple, in such a symmetrical environment (an AA' system), they often appear as a **single singlet** (or a narrow multiplet that looks like a singlet). The integration is **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two distinct types of methyl groups:\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        This results in **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which simplifies to **1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 3 signals total (one 2H aromatic singlet, two 6H alkyl singlets).\n\n*   **4. 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are all chemically equivalent. They will appear as a **single singlet** with an integration of **4H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The protons within the ethyl group are not.\n        *   The -CH2- protons will be a **quartet** (split by the -CH3) with an integration of **4H**.\n        *   The -CH3- protons will be a **triplet** (split by the -CH2-) with an integration of **6H**.\n    *   **Summary:** 3 signals total (one aromatic singlet, one alkyl quartet, one alkyl triplet). This is immediately ruled out because the problem states all signals in the aliphatic region are singlets.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Mixture Spectrum**\n\nWe need to find a 1:1 mixture of two compounds that produces the observed spectrum. We can eliminate any option containing 1,4-diethylbenzene (Option C) because it would produce a quartet and a triplet. We are left with options A, B, and D.\n\nLet's test the remaining combinations:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The combined spectrum would show three singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio. This does not match the \"two singlets in a 1:1 ratio\" observation.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,4-TMB:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. If these two singlets have different chemical shifts, the combined spectrum will show **two singlets**, each corresponding to 2H. In a 1:1 mixture, the integration ratio is **1:1**. **This matches the aromatic data.**\n    *   **Aliphatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets. The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This matches the aliphatic data.**\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The combined spectrum would show three singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio. This does not match the \"two singlets in a 1:1 ratio\" observation.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces the described 1H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:** The 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB and the 2H singlet from 1,2,3,4-TMB give two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic Region:** The 12H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB and the two 6H singlets from 1,2,3,4-TMB give three singlets in a 12:6:6 or 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Analyze the Provided NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's break down the information given from the 1H NMR spectrum of the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14. This corresponds to a degree of unsaturation of 4, consistent with a substituted benzene ring.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals, both are singlets, and their integration ratio is 1:1. This means there are two distinct types of aromatic protons in the mixture, and the total number of protons for each type is equal.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all are singlets, and their integration ratio is 2:1:1. This indicates three distinct types of alkyl protons (likely methyl groups since they are singlets), with their total proton counts in a 2:1:1 ratio. The chemical shift around 2.2 ppm is characteristic of methyl groups attached to a benzene ring.\n\n### **2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nWe need to determine the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds based on their molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has two planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single signal. Since there are no adjacent protons, this signal will be a **singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce a single signal, which will be a **singlet (12H)**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry passing through the C2-C5 axis.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The proton at C4 and the proton at C6 are in different chemical environments. They are not coupled to each other (meta-relationship). They will produce **two separate singlets (1H each)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        1.  The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  The methyl group at C2 is unique (3H).\n        3.  The methyl group at C5 is unique (3H).\n        This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 3 aliphatic singlets (ratio 2:1:1).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single signal. Since they are equivalent, they appear as a **singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        1.  The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        This results in **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which simplifies to **1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 aliphatic singlets (ratio 1:1).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four aromatic protons are equivalent, giving **one singlet (4H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The CH2 protons will be split by the CH3 protons into a **quartet (4H)**, and the CH3 protons will be split by the CH2 protons into a **triplet (6H)**.\n    *   **Summary:** The presence of a quartet and a triplet is inconsistent with the experimental data, which only shows singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**, which also eliminates option D.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we combine the spectra of the remaining candidates in a 1:1 ratio to see which pair matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The combined spectrum would show three singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio. This does not match the observed two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB also gives one 2H singlet. Assuming they have slightly different chemical shifts, the combined spectrum will show **two singlets**. Since they both represent 2H and the mixture is 1:1, their integration ratio will be **1:1**. **This matches the experimental data.**\n    *   **Aliphatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H each). The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** (assuming they all have different chemical shifts). The integration ratio will be 12H:6H:6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This also matches the experimental data.**\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The combined spectrum would show three singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio. This does not match the observed two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces the described 1H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the 1H NMR data provided.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** 1:1.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. This means there are two types of aromatic protons in the mixture, and they are present in equal amounts. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this implies that each compound contributes an equal number of protons to these two signals.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. This indicates three distinct types of methyl groups in the mixture.\n\n### Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR spectra for each individual compound.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Low.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are not equivalent. They are meta to each other, so coupling is negligible, resulting in **two singlets** (1H each).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3, the one at C2, and the one at C5. This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Moderate.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. Because they are adjacent (ortho), they couple, but due to symmetry (an AA' system), they often appear as a single, sometimes broadened, signal. We will approximate this as **one singlet** (2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 and the pair at C2/C3. This results in **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, or 1:1.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four protons on the ring are equivalent, producing **one singlet** (4H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. Each gives a quartet (-CH2-) and a triplet (-CH3). This results in **one quartet** (4H) and **one triplet** (6H), not singlets.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the options based on a 1:1 mixture.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Would show three singlets (one 2H signal from the first compound and two 1H signals from the second), with a 2:1:1 ratio. This does not match the observed two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** Would show four singlets (one from the first compound, three from the second). This does not match the observed three singlets.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Would show three singlets (two 1H signals from the first compound, one 4H signal from the second). This does not match.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** Would show three singlets, a quartet, and a triplet. This does not match.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Would show three singlets (one 2H signal from the first compound, two 1H signals from the second). This does not match.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** Would show up to five singlets (two from the first, three from the second). This does not match.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** The first compound gives one 2H singlet. The second compound gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets**, each integrating to 2H, giving the observed **1:1 ratio**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** The first compound gives one singlet (12H). The second compound gives two singlets (6H each). In a 1:1 mixture, this results in a total of **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is also a perfect match.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene in a 1:1 mixture is the only option that perfectly explains the observed 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the 1H NMR data to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n### Analysis of the Provided 1H NMR Spectrum Data\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** 1:1\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio, the two aromatic signals must come from protons that are equal in number. For example, two different 2H signals, or two different 1H signals that happen to have a 1:1 ratio due to the mixture.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n### Evaluating Each Compound's Expected 1H NMR Spectrum\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons to couple with, so they appear as a single **singlet** representing 2 hydrogens (2H).\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as a single **singlet** representing 12 hydrogens (12H).\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a single plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** There are two non-equivalent aromatic protons at positions 4 and 6. Neither has an adjacent proton, so they appear as two distinct **singlets**, each representing 1 hydrogen (1H).\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique (3H).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique (3H).\n        *   This results in three **singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are chemically equivalent but are adjacent to each other. This ortho-coupling means they will split each other, appearing as a pair of doublets (an AB system), not singlets. This compound can be immediately ruled out as it does not produce singlets in the aromatic region.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** It would show two singlets for the methyl groups (one for C1/C4 and one for C2/C3).\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are chemically equivalent and appear as a single **singlet** (4H).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The signals for the ethyl groups would be a quartet for the CH2 and a triplet for the CH3, not singlets. This compound can also be ruled out.\n\n### Analyzing the Mixture Options\n\nBased on the individual spectra, only 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene produce only singlets in both the aromatic and aliphatic regions (ignoring the splitting in prehnitene and diethylbenzene). Let's examine the mixture described in option B.\n\n**Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene in a 1:1 mixture.**\n\n*   **Aromatic Signals:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one singlet (2H).\n    *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene provides two singlets (1H each).\n    *   The problem states there are only **two singlets in a 1:1 ratio**. This can happen if one of the 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene has the same chemical shift as the 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene. This would result in one signal integrating to 3H (2H+1H) and the other integrating to 1H, giving a 3:1 ratio. This contradicts the given 1:1 ratio.\n    *   Let's re-evaluate. What if the two aromatic signals observed are the 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and one of the aromatic protons from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, and the other proton from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene is overlapping with one of the methyl signals? This is highly unlikely.\n    *   Let's reconsider the aromatic signals from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. They are two 1H singlets. And the signal from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene is one 2H singlet. For the mixture to show two aromatic signals in a 1:1 ratio, it implies that the total number of protons for each signal is the same. This would happen if the two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene are the signals observed, and the 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene is coincidentally overlapping with one of them. This would lead to a 3:1 ratio.\n    *   There must be a misunderstanding of the problem or a simplification. Let's re-examine the aliphatic region, which is often more definitive.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Signals:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one singlet (12H).\n    *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene provides three singlets (in a 6H:3H:3H ratio).\n    *   **Combined:** The spectrum is described as having three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. This perfectly matches the signals from **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene alone**.\n    *   If the mixture contains 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, it should contribute a large 12H singlet. This would drastically alter the aliphatic region unless its signal overlaps perfectly with one of the signals from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n        *   Let's assume the 12H singlet from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene overlaps with the 6H singlet from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. The total integration would be (12H+6H) : 3H : 3H, which is an 18:3:3 or 6:1:1 ratio. This does not match.\n        *   Let's assume the 12H singlet from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene overlaps with one of the 3H singlets from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. The total integration would be 6H : (12H+3H) : 3H, which is a 6:15:3 or 2:5:1 ratio. This does not match.\n\nThere seems to be a contradiction in the problem statement as written. Let's reconsider the aromatic region. \"two signals (two singlets) at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio\".\n\nLet's assume there is a typo in the aliphatic ratio and re-evaluate the aromatic signals.\n*   **Mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic signals: 1 singlet (2H) from durene, 2 singlets (1H each) from isodurene.\n    *   If the 2H singlet from durene has a unique chemical shift, and the two 1H singlets from isodurene are also resolved, we would see three signals with a 2:1:1 ratio.\n    *   If the 2H singlet from durene overlaps with one of the 1H singlets from isodurene, we would see two signals with a 3:1 ratio.\n    *   If the two 1H singlets from isodurene have the same chemical shift (unlikely but possible), and this is different from the durene signal, we would see two signals with a 2H:2H or 1:1 ratio. Let's check if this is plausible. The two aromatic protons in isodurene are in slightly different environments, so their signals should be distinct.\n\nLet's reconsider the aliphatic region. \"three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio\". This is the exact pattern for 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene's methyl groups (6H:3H:3H). Where does the signal for 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene's methyl groups (12H) go? For the overall ratio to be 2:1:1, the 12H signal must be hidden or overlapping in a very specific way.\n\nLet's reconsider the question and options. There might be a simpler interpretation.\n\n*   **Aromatic:** Two singlets, 1:1 ratio.\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene has one 2H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene has two 1H singlets.\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene has one 2H signal (not a singlet).\n    *   If we mix **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**, we get a 2H singlet and a 2H non-singlet. This doesn't match.\n    *   If we mix **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**, we have a 2H singlet and two 1H singlets. This is three signals.\n    *   What if the question implies that the two compounds *together* create this pattern?\n\nLet's assume the two compounds are **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**.\n*   **Aromatic Protons:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB: 1 singlet (2H) at ~6.89 ppm.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB: 2 singlets (1H each).\n    *   The problem states two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. This could mean the 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB and the two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB accidentally integrate to a 1:1 ratio. This is only possible if the two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB are coincidentally equivalent, giving a 2H singlet. Then we would have two 2H singlets, which is a 1:1 ratio. This is the most plausible explanation for the aromatic region.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Protons:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB: 1 singlet (12H) at ~2.18 ppm.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB: 3 singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   The problem states three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. This is the exact pattern for the methyl groups of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. This implies that the large 12H singlet from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene must be overlapping with one of the signals from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n    *   Let's assume the 12H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB overlaps with the 6H singlet from 1,2,3,5-TMB. This would give three signals with integrals of (12+6)H : 3H : 3H, which is an 18:3:3 or 6:1:1 ratio. This does not match the 2:1:1 ratio given.\n\nThere is a clear contradiction in the problem statement. However, in multiple-choice questions of this nature, one must often find the \"best fit\" even if the data is imperfectly described.\n\nLet's re-evaluate from the start, assuming there is a correct answer among the options.\n*   Options A and C are ruled out because 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene does not give an aromatic singlet.\n*   Option D is ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene gives a quartet and a triplet, not singlets, for its alkyl protons.\n\nThis leaves only **Option B** as a possibility. Let's try to reconcile the data with this option.\n*   **Compounds:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n*   **Aliphatic Signals:** The problem states three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. This is the signature of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene's methyl groups (6H:3H:3H). For this to be the observed ratio in a 1:1 mixture, the 12H singlet from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene must be accounted for. The only way the 2:1:1 ratio is preserved is if the 12H signal from 1,2,4,5-TMB overlaps with the 6H signal from 1,2,3,5-TMB, and the problem statement has a typo in the ratio. For instance, if the ratio was 6:1:1, it would fit. Given the provided 2:1:1 ratio, there is a strong contradiction.\n*   **Aromatic Signals:** The problem states two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB gives a 2H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets.\n    *   For these to result in two singlets with a 1:1 ratio, the most likely scenario (within the constraints of a flawed question) is that the two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB are coincidentally degenerate (have the same chemical shift), creating a single 2H singlet. This, combined with the 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB, would give two 2H singlets, resulting in a 1:1 integration ratio.\n\n**Conclusion based on best fit:**\nDespite the contradictions in the data (particularly the aliphatic ratio), Option B is the only one that contains compounds that could plausibly create the described signals (all singlets). The other options include compounds that fundamentally do not match the signal splitting (non-singlets). Therefore, assuming there are errors in the problem's description of the ratios, Option B is the only chemically sound choice.\n\nFinal check:\n- Aromatic: Two 2H singlets (1:1 ratio) is plausible if the two 1H protons in 1,2,3,5-TMB are accidentally equivalent in the NMR.\n- Aliphatic: Three singlets (2:1:1 ratio). This is the pattern for 1,2,3,5-TMB. The 12H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB is problematic. However, if we must choose the best option, B is the only one that doesn't violate fundamental splitting rules.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### 1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** 1:1\n*   **Aromatic Region:** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. Since the mixture is 1:1, the total number of aromatic protons from each compound must be equal. Let's say each compound contributes 'x' protons to the aromatic region. The total integration would be 2x. The two signals having a 1:1 ratio means each signal corresponds to 'x' protons.\n*   **Alkyl Region:** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n### 2. Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum of Each Option\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each individual compound.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Low.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are not equivalent. This will produce **two separate singlets**, each for 1H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the one at C5, the one at C2, and the two equivalent ones at C1 and C3. This will produce **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 3H:3H:6H, which simplifies to **1:1:2**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Moderate.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are adjacent (ortho-coupling). They will split each other, producing **two doublets**, not singlets.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: C1/C4 and C2/C3. This will produce **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which simplifies to **1:1**.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four protons are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 4H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. This will produce a **quartet** (4H, from the two -CH2- groups) and a **triplet** (6H, from the two -CH3 groups).\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Options Based on the Mixture's Spectrum\n\nNow, let's analyze the combined spectrum for a 1:1 mixture of each pair.\n\n**A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   **Alkyl Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet of 12H.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two singlets, each of 6H.\n    *   The combined spectrum would show **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 12H:6H:6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches the experimental data for the alkyl region.\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet (2H).\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two doublets (1H each).\n    *   The problem states there are \"two singlets\" in a 1:1 ratio. This appears to be a contradiction. However, the alkyl region data is a perfect and unambiguous match. It is highly likely that the description of the aromatic region is slightly inaccurate in the problem statement. For instance, the two doublets from 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene might be considered as one \"signal\" (a multiplet) integrating to 2H. This would result in two signals (one singlet, one multiplet) with a 2H:2H or 1:1 integration ratio. Given the perfect fit of the alkyl data, this is the most plausible option.\n\n**B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n*   **Alkyl Region:** This mixture would show three singlets (from 1,2,3,5-TMB) plus a quartet and a triplet (from 1,4-diethylbenzene). This does not match the observation of only three singlets.\n\n**C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   **Alkyl Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet (12H).\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   The combined spectrum would have four singlets with a ratio of 12:6:3:3 (or 4:2:1:1). This does not match the observed 2:1:1 ratio unless there is an accidental overlap of the two 3H signals, which is an extra assumption.\n*   **Aromatic Region:** This mixture would show three singlets (one 2H and two 1H signals), which contradicts the \"two signals\" observation.\n\n**D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   **Alkyl Region:** This mixture would produce at least five singlets (two from 1,2,3,4-TMB and three from 1,2,3,5-TMB), which is inconsistent with the data.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe data for the alkyl region (three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio) is uniquely and perfectly explained by the combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. Despite the conflicting description of the aromatic region signals as \"singlets,\" the strength of the evidence from the alkyl region makes this the only logical choice.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the information provided in the question.**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** The mixture contains two compounds, both with the formula C10H14.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** The two compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both are singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all are singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\n**Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four candidate compounds.**\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single signal, a singlet, integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent. They will produce a single signal, a singlet, integrating to 12H.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has a single plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. They will produce two distinct signals. Since neither has an adjacent proton, they will both be singlets, each integrating to 1H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        1.  The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent by symmetry (a singlet for 6H).\n        2.  The methyl group at C2 is unique (a singlet for 3H).\n        3.  The methyl group at C5 is unique (a singlet for 3H).\n    *   This gives three aliphatic singlets with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n    *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 3 aliphatic singlets (in a 2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent but are adjacent to each other. They will couple and split each other's signals, resulting in a pair of doublets (an AX or AB system), not singlets.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** Two sets of equivalent methyl groups (C1/C4 and C2/C3), giving two singlets, each for 6H.\n    *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic doublets, 2 aliphatic singlets.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are all equivalent, giving one singlet for 4H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The protons of the ethyl groups will show splitting. The CH2 protons will be a quartet (split by the CH3) and the CH3 protons will be a triplet (split by the CH2).\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet, 1 aliphatic quartet, 1 aliphatic triplet.\n\n**Step 3: Use the process of elimination to find the correct pair of compounds.**\n\nThe problem states that all observed signals are **singlets**. This is a crucial piece of information.\n\n*   **Eliminate options with 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** Prehnitene produces aromatic **doublets**, not singlets. This rules out options A and D.\n    *   A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene -> **Incorrect**.\n    *   D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene -> **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **Eliminate the option with 1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound produces an aliphatic **quartet** and **triplet**. The problem specifies that all aliphatic signals are singlets. This rules out option C.\n    *   C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene -> **Incorrect**.\n\n**Step 4: Confirm the remaining option.**\n\nBy elimination, the only possible answer is **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\nLet's verify how this mixture could produce the observed spectrum:\n*   **Aromatic Region:** The mixture contains Durene (one 2H singlet) and Isodurene (two 1H singlets). The problem states there are two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. This can happen if the two 1H singlets of Isodurene are not resolved by the spectrometer and appear as a single 2H singlet. The spectrum would then show the 2H singlet from Durene and the unresolved 2H singlet from Isodurene, resulting in two signals with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic Region:** The mixture contains Durene (one 12H singlet) and Isodurene (three singlets of 6H, 3H, and 3H). The problem states there are three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. The aliphatic signals of Isodurene alone perfectly match this description (6H:3H:3H = 2:1:1). The question is likely constructed such that the complex pattern of Isodurene is the identifying feature, and the signal from Durene is assumed to overlap with one of the other signals or the question is simplified. However, the elimination of all other options is definitive.\n\nBased on the strict criteria of signal splitting (singlets vs. other multiplets), option B is the only chemically sound choice.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe objective is to identify which pair of compounds from the given options, when mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio, produces the described 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Given NMR Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14. All options are isomers with this formula.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** 1:1 molar ratio. This is crucial for comparing the integration of signals from the two different compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. This means that in the 1:1 mixture, the total number of protons contributing to the first singlet is equal to the total number of protons contributing to the second singlet.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. This tells us about the relative number of methyl protons in different chemical environments.\n\n### **3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nWe need to determine the number of signals, their multiplicity (singlet, doublet, etc.), and the integration for both the aromatic and aliphatic protons of each potential compound. This is done by analyzing the molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric. It has two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single signal. Since there are no adjacent protons, it will be a **singlet**. Integration: **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce a single signal, a **singlet**. Integration: 4 x 3H = **12H**.\n    *   **Summary for Durene:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. Although they are adjacent (ortho), equivalent protons do not split each other. They will produce a single **singlet**. Integration: **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. This gives one **singlet**. Integration: 2 x 3H = **6H**.\n        *   The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent. This gives a second **singlet**. Integration: 2 x 3H = **6H**.\n    *   **Summary for Prehnitene:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 aliphatic singlets (6H each).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** A single plane of symmetry passes through the C2 and C5 carbons.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at C4 and C6 are in different chemical environments and are not equivalent. They will produce two separate signals. Meta-coupling is usually too small to be resolved, so they will appear as two **singlets**. Integration: **1H each**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent. One **singlet**. Integration: **6H**.\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique. A second **singlet**. Integration: **3H**.\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique. A third **singlet**. Integration: **3H**.\n    *   **Summary for Isodurene:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 3 aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric, like Durene.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four ring protons are chemically equivalent. They will produce one **singlet**. Integration: **4H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The two methylene (-CH2-) groups are equivalent. They are split by the adjacent methyl group protons into a **quartet**. Integration: **4H**.\n        *   The two methyl (-CH3) groups are equivalent. They are split by the adjacent methylene group protons into a **triplet**. Integration: **6H**.\n    *   **Summary for 1,4-diethylbenzene:** 1 aromatic singlet (4H), 1 aliphatic quartet (4H), 1 aliphatic triplet (6H).\n\n### **4. Evaluate Each Option Against the Mixture's Spectrum**\n\nNow, let's combine the predicted spectra for each pair in a 1:1 ratio and see which one matches the experimental data.\n\n**A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n*   **Aromatic Region:** Durene gives one 2H singlet. Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet. The mixture will show **two singlets**. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio and each signal represents 2 protons, the integration ratio will be 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. **This matches the data.**\n*   **Aliphatic Region:** Durene gives one 12H singlet. Prehnitene gives two 6H singlets. The mixture will show **three singlets** (assuming they have different chemical shifts). The integration ratio will be 12H:6H:6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This matches the data.**\n*   **Conclusion:** This option is a perfect match.\n\n**B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n*   **Aromatic Region:** Durene gives one 2H singlet. Isodurene gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show three signals (one 2H, two 1H), not two. This does not match.\n\n**C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene) and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n*   **Aromatic Region:** Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet. Isodurene gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show three signals, not two. This does not match.\n\n**D) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene) and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n*   **Aliphatic Region:** The spectrum for this mixture would contain singlets, a quartet, and a triplet. The problem states there are only three singlets in the aliphatic region. This does not match.\n\n### **5. Final Answer**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that correctly predicts the observed 1H NMR spectrum for the 1:1 mixture is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the predicted 1H NMR spectra for the candidate molecules and then combining them to match the experimental data for the mixture.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Given NMR Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds. All four options are isomers with this formula.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** 1:1. This is crucial because it means the integration values from each compound contribute equally to the total spectrum.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets in a 1:1 integration ratio. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this implies that each compound must contribute one aromatic singlet, and these singlets must represent an equal number of protons.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 integration ratio. These signals are the sum of all the methyl protons from both compounds in the mixture.\n\n**Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nWe determine the number of unique proton environments in each molecule based on its symmetry.\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-CH3):** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n    *   *Spectrum Summary:* 2 signals total.\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-CH3):** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: C1/C3 are equivalent (6H), C2 is unique (3H), and C5 is unique (3H). This gives **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which is **2:1:1**.\n    *   *Spectrum Summary:* 4 signals total.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-CH3):** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: C1/C4 are equivalent (6H) and C2/C3 are equivalent (6H). This gives **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which is **1:1**.\n    *   *Spectrum Summary:* 3 signals total.\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This compound has ethyl groups. The protons on the CH2 group will be split by the protons on the CH3 group, resulting in a quartet and a triplet in the aliphatic region. The problem states that all aliphatic signals are singlets. Therefore, this compound can be immediately ruled out, eliminating any option containing it.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Proposed Mixtures**\n\nWe will now combine the predicted spectra for the pairs in the options.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. The mixture will show **two singlets** in a **1:1 ratio**. This matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H and 6H). The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with relative integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also matches the data.\n    *   **This option is a perfect match.**\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Both give a 2H singlet, so the mixture has two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. This part is correct.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combined spectrum would have a total of **four aliphatic singlets**. This contradicts the data, which states there are only three.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   This option is ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not give only singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Both give a 2H singlet, so the mixture has two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. This part is correct.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H, 6H). 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combined spectrum would have at least four signals (assuming one of the 6H signals overlaps). This does not result in three signals with a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces the described NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nTo solve this problem, we need to predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the candidate molecules and then see which 1:1 mixture matches the experimental data.\n\n**Experimental Data for the 1:1 Mixture:**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum of Each Individual Compound**\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetric, with two planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent.

This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to 1 proton.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the one at C5, the one at C2, and the equivalent pair at C1 and C3. This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. This gives **one singlet** for these 2 protons.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: the pair at C1 and C4, and the pair at C2 and C3. This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to 6 protons (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are all equivalent, resulting in **one singlet** for 4 protons.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent.

This matches the experimental data.\n*   **Alkyl Signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene gives two 6H singlets. In a 1:1 mixture, this combination results in three singlets with integrals corresponding to 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio of these integrals is 12:6:6, which simplifies to 2:1:1. This perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n**D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n*   This mixture would result in three aromatic signals (one 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene), which contradicts the data.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only pair that fits the described 1H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **Goal:** Identify two compounds from a list of four that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produce a specific 1H NMR spectrum.\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for all candidate compounds.\n    *   **Mixture:** 1:1 molar ratio. This means the total number of protons contributed by each compound to the spectrum is equal.\n    *   **NMR Data (Aromatic Region):** Two singlets around 6.7 ppm with a 1:1 integral ratio.\n    *   **NMR Data (Aliphatic Region):** Three singlets around 2.2 ppm with a 2:1:1 integral ratio.\n\n2.  **Analyze Each Candidate Compound's Predicted 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The key is to determine the number of unique proton environments (which gives the number of signals) and the number of protons in each environment (which gives the integration). Symmetry is crucial here.\n\n    *   **Candidate 1: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n        *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric. Two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n        *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at C3 and C6 are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** for 2 protons (2H).\n        *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** for 12 protons (12H).\n        *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n    *   **Candidate 2: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n        *   **Symmetry:** No plane of symmetry that makes protons or methyl groups equivalent in the way needed.\n        *   **Aromatic Protons:** The proton at C4 (between two methyl groups) is different from the proton at C6 (between a methyl group and a hydrogen on the adjacent carbon, C1). So, **two aromatic singlets**, each for 1 proton (1H).\n        *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are in unique chemical environments. So, **four aliphatic singlets**, each for 3 protons (3H).\n        *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 4 aliphatic singlets (3H each).\n\n    *   **Candidate 3: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n        *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n        *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at C5 and C6 are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** for 2 protons (2H).\n        *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent but different from the first pair. This gives **two aliphatic singlets**, each for 6 protons (6H).\n        *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 aliphatic singlets (6H each).\n\n    *   **Candidate 4: 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n        *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n        *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four ring protons are equivalent, giving **one singlet** (4H).\n        *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The ethyl groups show spin-spin splitting. The CH2 protons will be a quartet and the CH3 protons will be a triplet.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene is not a possible component**. This immediately eliminates option C.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Mixture Options based on the combined spectra:**\n\n    *   **Observed Aromatic Spectrum:** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. In a 1:1 mixture, this means each compound must contribute one singlet, and the number of protons for each singlet must be equal.\n    *   **Observed Aliphatic Spectrum:** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. The total number of aliphatic protons is 12 (from compound 1) + 12 (from compound 2) = 24. A 2:1:1 ratio of 24 protons means the signals correspond to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n    *   **Option A: 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,4-TMB**\n        *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. Combined, this is **two singlets**. Since both are 2H, the ratio is 1:1. **This matches.**\n        *   **Aliphatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets. Combined, this is **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to 2:1:1. **This matches.**\n        *   **Conclusion:** This option is a perfect fit.\n\n    *   **Option B: 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB**\n        *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two singlets. The total is three aromatic singlets. **This does not match.**\n\n    *   **Option D: 1,2,3,4-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB**\n        *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two singlets. The total is three aromatic singlets. **This does not match.**\n\n4.  **Final Answer Selection:**\n    *   Only option A correctly predicts the number and ratio of signals in both the aromatic and aliphatic regions of the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_nmr_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes 1H NMR data for mixtures of aromatic compounds to find the correct pair.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the predicted 1H NMR spectra for each candidate compound.\n    # The value is a dictionary containing lists of proton counts for each signal type.\n    # e.g., \"aromatic\": [2] means one aromatic singlet integrating to 2 protons.\n    # \"aliphatic\": [6, 6] means two aliphatic singlets, each integrating to 6 protons.\n    # \"notes\" are used to disqualify candidates based on splitting patterns.\n    compounds_data = {\n        \"1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\": {\n            \"aromatic\": [2],\n            \"aliphatic\": [12],\n            \"notes\": \"All singlets\"\n        },\n        \"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\": {\n            \"aromatic\": [1, 1],\n            \"aliphatic\": [3, 3, 3, 3],\n            \"notes\": \"All singlets\"\n        },\n        \"1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\": {\n            \"aromatic\": [2],\n            \"aliphatic\": [6, 6],\n            \"notes\": \"All singlets\"\n        },\n        \"1,4-diethylbenzene\": {\n            \"aromatic\": [4],\n            \"aliphatic\": [4, 6], # Proton counts for quartet and triplet\n            \"notes\": \"Contains non-singlet signals (quartet, triplet)\"\n        }\n    }\n\n    # Step 2: Define the options provided in the problem.\n    options = {\n        \"A\": [\"1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\"],\n        \"B\": [\"1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\"],\n        \"C\": [\"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,4-diethylbenzene\"],\n        \"D\": [\"1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\"]\n    }\n\n    # Step 3: Define the observed spectral data from the problem description.\n    observed_aromatic_signals = 2\n    observed_aromatic_ratio = [1, 1] # Two signals of equal intensity\n    observed_aliphatic_signals = 3\n    observed_aliphatic_ratio = [2, 1, 1]\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the problem based on predicted 1H NMR spectra...\\n\")\n\n    correct_option = None\n    # Step 4: Iterate through each option and test if it matches the observed data.\n    for option, pair in options.items():\n        print(f\"--- Checking Option {option}: {pair[0]} and {pair[1]} ---\")\n        \n        comp1_name, comp2_name = pair\n        comp1 = compounds_data[comp1_name]\n        comp2 = compounds_data[comp2_name]\n        \n        # Check for non-singlet disqualification\n        if \"non-singlet\" in comp1[\"notes\"] or \"non-singlet\" in comp2[\"notes\"]:\n            print(\"Result: Mismatch.

This corresponds to a degree of unsaturation of 4, consistent with a substituted benzene ring.\n2.  **Mixture Ratio:** The two compounds are present in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n3.  **1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals, both are singlets, and their integration ratio is 1:1.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all are singlets, and their integration ratio is 2:1:1.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Candidate Compounds\nWe need to predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds. All of them have the formula C10H14.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has two planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 are all chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n    *   **Summary (Durene):** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry passing through the methyl groups at C2 and C5. This plane makes C1 and C3 equivalent, and C4 and C6 equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        1.  The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  The methyl group at C2 is unique (3H).\n        3.  The methyl group at C5 is unique (3H).\n        This will result in **three singlets** in the aliphatic region with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Summary (Isodurene):** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 3 aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds. This makes C1 equivalent to C4, C2 equivalent to C3, and C5 equivalent to C6.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. Since equivalent protons do not split each other, they will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        1.  The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        This will result in **two singlets** in the aliphatic region with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which simplifies to **1:1**.\n    *   **Summary (Prehnitene):** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 aliphatic singlets (6H, 6H).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are all chemically equivalent and will appear as a **singlet** integrating to **4H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. Within each ethyl group, the CH2 protons are split by the CH3 protons, and vice-versa. This will result in a **quartet** (4H total) and a **triplet** (6H total).\n    *   **Summary (1,4-diethylbenzene):** 1 aromatic singlet (4H), 1 aliphatic quartet (4H), 1 aliphatic triplet (6H).\n    *   **Careful Point:** The problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated** from the possibilities.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Mixture Based on the Options\n\nNow we combine the predicted spectra for the compounds in each option, remembering the mixture is 1:1.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not have only singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Both compounds give one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this would result in two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. This matches.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** Prehnitene gives two 6H singlets. Isodurene gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combined spectrum would have up to five signals (or fewer if there is accidental overlap). This does not match the observation of three signals with a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Both Durene (1,2,4,5-) and Prehnitene (1,2,3,4-) give one 2H singlet each. In a 1:1 mixture, this will produce **two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio**. This perfectly matches the experimental data.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** Durene gives one singlet for 12H. Prehnitene gives two singlets, each for 6H. The combined spectrum will therefore show **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio of these integrations is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Both compounds give one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this would result in two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. This matches.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** Durene gives one 12H singlet. Isodurene gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combined spectrum would have four signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H), unless the two 3H signals from Isodurene happen to have the same chemical shift. This is chemically unlikely and doesn't provide as direct a fit as option C.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe 1:1 mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)** is the only option that perfectly accounts for all the features of the described 1H NMR spectrum without requiring any assumptions about accidental signal overlap.\n\n*   **Aromatic:** Durene (1s, 2H) + Prehnitene (1s, 2H) -> 2 singlets, 1:1 ratio. **(Correct)**\n*   **Aliphatic:** Durene (1s, 12H) + Prehnitene (2s, 6H + 6H) -> 3 singlets, 12H:6H:6H or 2:1:1 ratio. **(Correct)**\n\nThus, the two compounds are 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nTo determine the two compounds in the mixture, we must analyze the provided 1H NMR data and compare it with the expected spectra for each potential compound.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Experimental NMR Data**\n\n*   **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar ratio of two compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals. Both are singlets, and their integration ratio is 1:1.\n    *   Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this means each compound contributes one aromatic singlet.\n    *   The 1:1 integration ratio signifies that the number of protons creating the singlet from the first compound is equal to the number of protons creating the singlet from the second compound.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals. All are singlets, and their integration ratio is 2:1:1.\n    *   The fact that all alkyl signals are singlets immediately suggests that the compounds are tetramethylbenzenes, as ethyl groups would produce a characteristic quartet and triplet. This allows us to eliminate **1,4-diethylbenzene** and, consequently, **option D**.\n    *   In a 1:1 mixture, the total number of alkyl protons is 12 (from compound 1) + 12 (from compound 2) = 24 protons.\n    *   The 2:1:1 ratio represents a total of 4 parts. The integration for each signal is:\n        *   Signal 1: (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n        *   Signal 2: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n        *   Signal 3: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   Therefore, the mixture's spectrum must show three alkyl singlets with integrations corresponding to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n### **2. Predicted Spectra for the Candidate Compounds**\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR signals for the remaining tetramethylbenzene isomers:\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   Due to its high symmetry, it has two types of protons.\n    *   **Aromatic:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet integrating to 2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl:** The four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one singlet integrating to 12H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet integrating to 2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: (C1-Me, C4-Me) and (C2-Me, C3-Me). This results in **two singlets, each integrating to 6H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule is less symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different environments. They would produce **two singlets, each integrating to 1H**.\n    *   **Alkyl:** All four methyl groups are in unique environments. This would produce **four singlets, each integrating to 3H**.\n\n### **3. Evaluating the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we can test which 1:1 mixture matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **Mixture A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB also contributes one 2H singlet. The mixture will show **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 2H:2H, which simplifies to **1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two singlets (6H each). The mixture will show a total of **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is also a perfect match.\n\nThis combination perfectly explains all features of the observed spectrum. We can quickly check the other options to be certain.\n\n*   **Mixture B:** Would have 3 aromatic signals (one 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB and two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB). This does not match the observed 2 signals.\n*   **Mixture C:** Would also have 3 aromatic signals (one 2H singlet from 1,2,3,4-TMB and two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB). This does not match.\n\nTherefore, the mixture must contain 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nThe provided 1H NMR data for a 1:1 mixture of two C10H14 aromatic compounds indicates the presence of two singlets in the aromatic region (~6.7 ppm) with a 1:1 ratio, and three singlets in the alkyl region (~2.2 ppm) with a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nLet's analyze the expected 1H NMR signals for each potential compound:\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** Due to its high symmetry, all four methyl groups are equivalent, and the two aromatic protons are equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** One singlet (for 2H).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** One singlet (for 12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry. The methyl groups at positions 1 and 4 are equivalent, and the methyl groups at positions 2 and 3 are equivalent. The two aromatic protons at positions 5 and 6 are also equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** One singlet (for 2H).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** Two singlets (one for 6H, one for 6H, a 1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has lower symmetry. It shows two distinct aromatic protons and three sets of non-equivalent methyl groups.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** Two singlets (1H each).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** Three singlets (in a 6H:3H:3H ratio).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has four equivalent aromatic protons. The ethyl groups would produce a quartet and a triplet, not singlets, in the alkyl region. Therefore, it can be ruled out.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the mixture options:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** This mixture would result in three aromatic signals (one from the first compound and two from the second), which contradicts the data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one 2H singlet, and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in two singlets of equal integration (1:1 ratio), which matches the experimental data.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one singlet (corresponding to 12H). 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene gives two singlets (each corresponding to 6H). The combination would show three singlets with an integration ratio of 12H:6H:6H, which simplifies to 2:1:1. This perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** This mixture would produce three aromatic signals, which is inconsistent with the observed spectrum.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** This combination is incorrect due to the number of aromatic signals and the signal splitting (quartet/triplet) from 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\nBased on the analysis, the mixture must contain 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nTo solve this problem, a detailed analysis of the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each potential compound is necessary. The spectrum of the 1:1 mixture shows two singlets in the aromatic region (~6.7 ppm) with a 1:1 ratio, and three singlets in the aliphatic region (~2.2 ppm) with a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n### **Analysis of Individual Compounds**\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a high degree of symmetry with two perpendicular planes.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. This results in a single signal, a singlet, for 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry. This results in a single signal, a singlet, for 12H.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry passing through the methyl groups at C2 and C5.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent due to this symmetry. This gives one singlet for 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups are in three different chemical environments:\n        *   The methyls at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyl at C2 is unique (3H).\n        *   The methyl at C5 is unique (3H).\n        This results in three aliphatic singlets with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 3 aliphatic singlets (2:1:1 ratio).\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are equivalent and will produce a single singlet for 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups are in two different chemical environments:\n        *   The methyls at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyls at C2 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        This results in two aliphatic singlets with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, or 1:1.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 aliphatic singlets (1:1 ratio).\n\n4.  **1,4-Diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a high degree of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four aromatic protons are equivalent, giving one singlet for 4H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The protons of the two equivalent ethyl groups will split into two signals: a quartet for the four methylene (-CH2-) protons and a triplet for the six methyl (-CH3) protons. These are not singlets.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (4H), 1 aliphatic quartet (4H), 1 aliphatic triplet (6H).\n\n### **Evaluation of the Mixture Options**\n\nThe experimental data for the 1:1 mixture is:\n*   **Aromatic:** Two singlets (1:1 ratio).\n*   **Aliphatic:** Three singlets (2:1:1 ratio).\n\nNow, let's analyze the proposed mixtures:\n\n*   **Mixture A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB has one aromatic singlet (2H). 1,2,3,5-TMB also has one aromatic singlet (2H). If these have different chemical shifts, the 1:1 mixture would show **two singlets**, each integrating to 2H, giving a **1:1 ratio**. This matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB has one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,5-TMB has three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). If the 12H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB coincidentally overlaps with the 6H singlet from 1,2,3,5-TMB, the combined spectrum would show:\n        *   One singlet at the position of the two overlapping signals, with an integration of 12H + 6H = 18H.\n        *   Two other singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB with integrations of 3H and 3H.\n        The resulting ratio would be 18H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 6:1:1. This does not match the observed 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nLet's reconsider the analysis for 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. Some sources suggest it has two separate aromatic protons and three methyl signals. Let's re-examine the correct assignments based on chemical databases. The initial analysis of three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio for 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene is correct. The error was in the combination.\n\nLet's re-examine the options with a fresh perspective. We are looking for a combination that produces a total of two aromatic singlets and three aliphatic singlets with the specified ratios.\n\n*   **The total number of aliphatic signals is three.**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB has one.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB has three.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB has two.\n    *   1,4-diethylbenzene has zero singlets.\n\nIf we mix two of these, the total number of aliphatic singlets (assuming no overlaps) would be:\n*   A) 1 + 3 = 4\n*   B) 3 + 0 = 3\n*   C) 2 + 3 = 5\n*   D) 1 + 2 = 3\n\nThis simple count suggests that options **B** and **D** are the most plausible candidates for producing exactly three aliphatic singlets.\n\n*   **Let's analyze Mixture D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** Both compounds show one aromatic singlet (2H each). A 1:1 mixture will produce **two aromatic singlets** in a **1:1 ratio**, assuming different chemical shifts. This matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB: one singlet (12H).\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB: two singlets (6H each).\n    *   **Combined Aliphatic Spectrum:** This mixture would exhibit a total of **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **Let's re-analyze Mixture B: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** 1,2,3,5-TMB has one singlet (2H). 1,4-diethylbenzene has one singlet (4H). The mixture would show two singlets with a ratio of 2:4, or 1:2. This contradicts the observed 1:1 ratio.\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** 1,2,3,5-TMB has three singlets. 1,4-diethylbenzene has a quartet and a triplet. The mixture would contain three singlets, a quartet, and a triplet, which does not match the data.\n\nBased on this detailed analysis, the combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only one that fits all the spectral data.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nMy initial analysis was based on predicting the 1H NMR spectra from the structures of the compounds. The search results confirm my predictions.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** Due to its high symmetry, it shows one singlet for the two aromatic protons (~6.89 ppm) and one singlet for the twelve protons of the four equivalent methyl groups (~2.18 ppm).\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry. It shows one singlet for the two equivalent aromatic protons at positions 5 and 6 (~6.88 ppm). It has two distinct sets of methyl groups: the ones at positions 1 and 4 are equivalent, and the ones at positions 2 and 3 are equivalent. This results in two singlets of equal integration (6H each) in the alkyl region (~2.17 and ~2.24 ppm).\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This compound has lower symmetry. It has two non-equivalent aromatic protons, which should give two separate singlets (1H each). It has three sets of methyl groups in a 2:1:1 ratio (6H, 3H, 3H), which will result in three singlets in the alkyl region.\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** The spectrum of this compound shows signals for the aromatic protons (a singlet because they are all equivalent) and a characteristic ethyl group pattern (a quartet and a triplet), not just singlets in the alkyl region. This confirms it can be ruled out.\n\nNow, let's re-evaluate the mixture based on the confirmed spectral data for the compounds in option D.\n\n**Mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (1:1 ratio):**\n\n1.  **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet for its 2 aromatic protons.\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet for its 2 aromatic protons.\n    *   Since the chemical shifts are slightly different, the mixture will show **two singlets**. Because each signal comes from 2 protons and the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio, the two singlets will have a **1:1 integration ratio**. This matches the experimental data.\n\n2.  **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes **one singlet** corresponding to its 12 equivalent methyl protons.\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes **two singlets** corresponding to its two sets of non-equivalent methyl groups (6 protons each).\n    *   In total, the mixture will show **three singlets** in the alkyl region.\n    *   The integration ratio will be 12H (from 1,2,4,5-isomer) : 6H (from 1,2,3,4-isomer) : 6H (from 1,2,3,4-isomer).\n    *   This simplifies to a **2:1:1 ratio**. This also perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n*   **A)** 1,4-diethylbenzene does not give only singlets in the alkyl region.\n*   **B) and C)** Both of these options include 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, which itself has two aromatic protons that give two separate singlets. When mixed with another tetramethylbenzene isomer that gives one aromatic singlet (like 1,2,4,5- or 1,2,3,4-), the resulting mixture would show a total of three aromatic singlets, which contradicts the data.\n\nTherefore, the two compounds in the mixture are 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**1. Analyze the Provided 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's break down the information given about the 1H NMR spectrum of the 1:1 mixture:\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are isomers with the formula C10H14. All four options fit this formula.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals, both of which are singlets. Their integration ratio is 1:1.\n    *   A **singlet** in the aromatic region means the proton(s) responsible for that signal have no adjacent protons to couple with.\n    *   A 1:1 integration ratio in a 1:1 molar mixture implies that the total number of aromatic protons in the first compound is equal to the total number of aromatic protons in the second compound.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all of which are singlets. Their integration ratio is 2:1:1.\n    *   The fact that these are all **singlets** is a crucial piece of information. An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) would produce a quartet and a triplet due to spin-spin coupling, not singlets. This immediately tells us the alkyl groups are likely methyl groups (-CH3).\n\n**2. Evaluate Each Candidate Compound**\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring with two ethyl groups at opposite positions (para).\n    *   **Symmetry:** High. All four aromatic protons are chemically equivalent. The two ethyl groups are equivalent.\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:**\n        *   Aromatic: One singlet (for 4H).\n        *   Alkyl: One quartet (for the 4H of the two -CH2- groups) and one triplet (for the 6H of the two -CH3 groups).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is inconsistent with the data because its alkyl signals are a quartet and a triplet, not singlets. It also has 4 aromatic protons, whereas the tetramethylbenzenes have 2. This would lead to a 2:1 aromatic signal ratio in a mixture, not 1:1. **1,4-diethylbenzene is eliminated.** This rules out option A.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring with four adjacent methyl groups.\n    *   **Symmetry:** It has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:**\n        *   Aromatic: There are two protons at C5 and C6. They are chemically equivalent due to symmetry, but they are adjacent to each other. Therefore, they will couple and appear as an AB quartet (or two doublets if the chemical shift difference is large enough). They will **not** be singlets.\n        *   Alkyl: Two singlets of 6H each (C1/C4 methyls are equivalent, and C2/C3 methyls are equivalent).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is inconsistent with the data because its aromatic signal would not be a singlet. **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is eliminated.** This rules out options B and D.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring with methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n    *   **Symmetry:** High. It has two planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:**\n        *   Aromatic: Two protons at C3 and C6. They are equivalent and have no adjacent protons. This will give **one singlet (2H)**.\n        *   Alkyl: The four methyl groups are all equivalent. This will give **one singlet (12H)**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is a possible candidate.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring with methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 3, and 5.\n    *   **Symmetry:** Low. There are no planes of symmetry or rotational axes.\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:**\n        *   Aromatic: Two protons at C4 and C6. They are in different chemical environments and have no adjacent protons. This will give **two singlets (1H each)**.\n        *   Alkyl: The four methyl groups are all in different chemical environments. This should theoretically give four singlets. However, due to accidental equivalence (isochrony), where different protons have very similar chemical shifts, the spectrum is simpler. It typically shows **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H (which is 2:1:1), as two of the methyl groups happen to resonate at the same frequency.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is a possible candidate.\n\n**3. Analyze the Mixture of the Remaining Candidates**\n\nThe only remaining possibility is a mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**. Let's see if a 1:1 mixture of these two fits the data.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   Durene provides one singlet integrating to 2H.\n    *   Isodurene provides two singlets, each integrating to 1H.\n    *   The problem states we observe **two singlets** with a **1:1 ratio**. This can happen if the two 1H singlets from Isodurene are accidentally equivalent under the experimental conditions, appearing as a single singlet that integrates to 2H.\n    *   So, we would have: Signal 1 (from Durene, 2H) and Signal 2 (from Isodurene, 2H). This gives two singlets in a 1:1 ratio, which matches the data perfectly.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region:**\n    *   Durene provides one singlet integrating to 12H.\n    *   Isodurene provides three singlets integrating to 6H, 3H, and 3H.\n    *   The problem states we observe **three singlets** with a **2:1:1 ratio**.\n    *   Let's analyze the total protons and ratios. The total number of methyl protons in the 1:1 mixture is 12H (from Durene) + 12H (from Isodurene) = 24H. A 2:1:1 ratio means the total is split into 4 parts (2+1+1). So each part is 24H / 4 = 6H. The signals must therefore integrate to 12H (2 parts), 6H (1 part), and 6H (1 part).\n    *   Let's see if we can form this from our components:\n        *   The **12H signal** comes directly from Durene.\n        *   The first **6H signal** comes from the 6H signal of Isodurene.\n        *   The second **6H signal** can be formed if the two 3H signals from Isodurene are accidentally equivalent and overlap, appearing as a single signal.\n    *   This combination (12H, 6H, 6H) gives an integration ratio of 2:1:1 and results in three singlets. This also matches the data perfectly.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed 1:1, can produce the described 1H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**1. Analyze the given information:**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture:** 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   Aromatic region (~6.7 ppm): Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   Aliphatic region (~2.2 ppm): Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n**2. Verify the Molecular Formula of the Options:**\nFirst, let's confirm that all the given compounds have the molecular formula C10H14.\n*   Tetramethylbenzenes: The base benzene ring is C6. Four methyl groups (CH3) replace four hydrogens. The formula is C6H(6-4)(CH3)4 = C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. This is true for 1,2,4,5-, 1,2,3,5-, and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n*   1,4-diethylbenzene: The base benzene ring is C6. Two ethyl groups (C2H5) replace two hydrogens. The formula is C6H(6-2)(C2H5)2 = C6H4(C4H10) = C10H14.\nAll options have the correct molecular formula.\n\n**3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound:**\nWe need to determine the number of signals, their multiplicity (singlet, doublet, etc.), and their relative integrations for each compound.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   Due to symmetry, the four aromatic protons are equivalent, producing a single singlet (4H).\n    *   The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The CH2 protons will be a quartet (4H) and the CH3 protons will be a triplet (6H).\n    *   Since the problem states there are only singlets in the aliphatic region, any mixture containing 1,4-diethylbenzene can be ruled out. This eliminates option **C**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** The two protons at C3 and C6 are equivalent. They will produce one singlet (2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They will produce one singlet (12H).\n    *   *Spectrum Summary:* 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   A plane of symmetry bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are equivalent. Although they are adjacent, in many cases they appear as a singlet due to similar magnetic environments or small coupling constant. We will assume they give one singlet (2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent (one signal, 6H). The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent to each other but different from the first pair (second signal, 6H). Both will be singlets.\n    *   *Spectrum Summary:* 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 aliphatic singlets (6H each).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   A plane of symmetry passes through C2 and C5.\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent. They will produce one singlet (2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (one signal, 6H).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique (second signal, 3H).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique (third signal, 3H).\n    *   *Spectrum Summary:* 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 3 aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n\n**4. Analyze the 1:1 Mixture Spectrum:**\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:** The mixture shows two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   Each of the three tetramethylbenzene isomers gives a single aromatic singlet integrating to 2H.\n    *   A 1:1 mixture of any two of these isomers will have two sets of aromatic protons, each contributing 2H. Assuming their chemical shifts are different, this will result in two singlets, each with an integration of 2H. The ratio 2H:2H is 1:1.\n    *   Therefore, the aromatic region data is consistent with any pair of the tetramethylbenzene isomers.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region:** The mixture shows three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n    *   Since it's a 1:1 mixture, the total number of aliphatic protons is the sum from both compounds: 12H + 12H = 24H.\n    *   A 2:1:1 ratio of a total of 24 protons means the integrations of the three signals are:\n        *   Signal 1: (2 / (2+1+1)) * 24H = (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n        *   Signal 2: (1 / (2+1+1)) * 24H = (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n        *   Signal 3: (1 / (2+1+1)) * 24H = (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   So, we are looking for a combination of two compounds that gives three aliphatic signals with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n**5. Evaluate the Remaining Options based on the Aliphatic Signals:**\n\nLet's see which pair of compounds produces the required set of signals {12H, 6H, 6H}. We'll combine the aliphatic signals predicted for each compound in the pair.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   Durene provides: {one 12H singlet}\n    *   Isodurene provides: {one 6H singlet, one 3H singlet, one 3H singlet}\n    *   Combined signals: {12H, 6H, 3H, 3H}. This is four signals, not three. This option is incorrect, unless one assumes the two 3H signals from Isodurene accidentally overlap, which is a significant assumption.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene) + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   Prehnitene provides: {one 6H singlet, one 6H singlet}\n    *   Isodurene provides: {one 6H singlet, one 3H singlet, one 3H singlet}\n    *   Combined signals: {6H, 6H, 6H, 3H, 3H}. This is five signals. This is a very poor match for the \"three signals\" described.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) + 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   Durene provides: {one 12H singlet}\n    *   Prehnitene provides: {one 6H singlet, one 6H singlet}\n    *   Combined signals: {12H, 6H, 6H}.\n    *   This combination gives exactly three signals with the correct integrations (12H, 6H, 6H), which corresponds to the observed 2:1:1 ratio. This assumes that the three signals (the one from Durene and the two from Prehnitene) are all resolved and do not overlap. This is the most straightforward interpretation of the data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only one that directly explains the aliphatic signals described in the problem (three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Information from the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\nThe problem provides the following key details about the 1H NMR spectrum of a 1:1 mixture of two C10H14 isomers:\n\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals.\n    *   Both are singlets.\n    *   They have an integration ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals.\n    *   All are singlets.\n    *   They have an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\nThe fact that all signals are singlets is a crucial clue. This means that none of the observed protons have any non-equivalent protons on adjacent carbon atoms.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nLet's analyze the structure of each of the four possible compounds to predict what its individual 1H NMR spectrum would look like. This involves looking at the molecule's symmetry.\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has two planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they appear as a **single singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-CH₃):** Due to symmetry, all four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will appear as a **single singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H) and 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n2.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. Equivalent protons do not split each other, so they appear as a **single singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-CH₃):** The symmetry creates two sets of equivalent methyl groups:\n        *   The methyls at C1 and C4 are equivalent: **1 singlet, 6H**.\n        *   The methyls at C2 and C3 are equivalent: **1 singlet, 6H**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H) and 2 aliphatic singlets (6H each).\n\n3.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has very low symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** The proton at C4 and the proton at C6 are in different chemical environments. Neither has an adjacent proton. This results in **two separate singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-CH₃):** All four methyl groups are in unique environments, resulting in **four separate singlets**, each integrating to **3H**.\n    *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each) and 4 aliphatic singlets (3H each).\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C₆H₄(C₂H₅)₂ = C₁₀H₁₄.\n    *   **Signals:** The ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃) would show splitting. The -CH₂- signal would be a quartet, and the -CH₃- signal would be a triplet.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the problem states all signals are singlets, **this compound can be eliminated** immediately.\n\n### **Step 3: Combine the Spectra to Match the Mixture Data**\n\nWe need to find a pair of compounds from the remaining three that, when mixed 1:1, matches the observed spectrum.\n\nLet's test the combination from **Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Aromatic Signals:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet (2H).\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet (2H).\n    *   **Total:** This gives **two singlets**. Since the mixture is 1:1, the protons contributing to each signal are present in equal amounts (2H from the first compound, 2H from the second). The integration ratio is 2:2, which simplifies to **1:1**. This perfectly matches the data.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Signals:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet (12H).\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes two singlets (each 6H).\n    *   **Total:** This gives **three singlets**. The integrations are for 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   The integration ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the data.\n\nThis combination successfully explains all features of the given NMR spectrum. The other options would not work. For instance, any combination with 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene would produce at least three aromatic signals, which contradicts the data.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nBased on the detailed analysis and confirmation from the code, the correct pair of compounds is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\nHere is a summary of why this combination works:\n*   **Aromatic Region:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one aromatic singlet for its 2 equivalent protons. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene also gives one aromatic singlet for its 2 equivalent protons. A 1:1 mixture of these two compounds will therefore show two distinct singlets with a 1:1 integral ratio, matching the experimental data.\n*   **Alkyl Region:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene is highly symmetric and gives a single signal for its four equivalent methyl groups (12H). 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene has two sets of equivalent methyl groups, giving two signals (6H each). When combined, the mixture shows three singlet signals with integrals of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio of these integrals is 12:6:6, which simplifies to 2:1:1, perfectly matching the experimental data.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nAnalyse der einzelnen Verbindungen:\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzol (Duren)**:\n    *   **Symmetrie**: Dieses Molekül ist hochsymmetrisch.\n    *   **Aromatische Protonen**: Es gibt zwei äquivalente aromatische Protonen (an den Positionen C3 und C6). Dies führt zu **einem Singulett** (2H) im aromatischen Bereich.\n    *   **Methylprotonen**: Alle vier Methylgruppen sind chemisch äquivalent. Dies führt zu **einem Singulett** (12H) im aliphatischen Bereich.\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzol (Isoduren)**:\n    *   **Symmetrie**: Dieses Molekül hat eine Symmetrieebene, die durch C2 und C5 verläuft.\n    *   **Aromatische Protonen**: Die beiden Protonen an C4 und C6 sind äquivalent. Dies führt zu **einem Singulett** (2H) im aromatischen Bereich.\n    *   **Methylprotonen**: Es gibt drei Sätze chemisch nicht äquivalenter Methylgruppen: die beiden äquivalenten Gruppen an C1 und C3 (6H), die einzelne Gruppe an C2 (3H) und die einzelne Gruppe an C5 (3H). Dies führt zu **drei Singuletts** im aliphatischen Bereich mit einem Integralverhältnis von 6:3:3, was einem Verhältnis von **2:1:1** entspricht.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzol (Prehniten)**:\n    *   **Aromatische Protonen**: Es gibt zwei Protonen an den Positionen C5 und C6. Da sie benachbart sind, koppeln sie miteinander und erzeugen ein System von **zwei Dubletts**, keine Singuletts. Diese Verbindung kann also ausgeschlossen werden.\n    *   **Methylprotonen**: Es gibt zwei Sätze äquivalenter Methylgruppen (C1/C4 und C2/C3), die zu zwei Singuletts im Verhältnis 1:1 (6H:6H) führen würden.\n\n4.  **1,4-Diethylbenzol**:\n    *   **Aromatische Protonen**: Alle vier aromatischen Protonen sind äquivalent, was zu **einem Singulett** (4H) führt.\n    *   **Alkylprotonen**: Die Ethylgruppen würden ein **Quartett** (CH₂) und ein **Triplett** (CH₃) erzeugen, keine Singuletts. Diese Verbindung kann also ausgeschlossen werden.\n\n**Analyse der Mischung:**\n\nDas 1H-NMR-Spektrum der 1:1-Mischung zeigt:\n*   **Aromatischer Bereich (~6,7 ppm)**: Zwei Singuletts im Verhältnis 1:1.\n*   **Aliphatischer Bereich (~2,2 ppm)**: Drei Singuletts im Verhältnis 2:1:1.\n\nBetrachten wir nun die Optionen:\n\n*   A) 1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzol und 1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzol: Falsch, da 1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzol Dubletts im aromatischen Bereich erzeugen würde.\n*   B) 1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzol und 1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzol: Falsch, aus demselben Grund wie A.\n*   D) 1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzol und 1,4-Diethylbenzol: Falsch, da 1,4-Diethylbenzol ein Quartett und ein Triplett im aliphatischen Bereich erzeugen würde.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzol und 1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzol**:\n    *   **Aromatischer Bereich**: 1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzol liefert ein Singulett (2H). 1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzol liefert ebenfalls ein Singulett (2H). Bei unterschiedlichen chemischen Verschiebungen führt eine 1:1-Mischung zu zwei Singuletts mit einem Integralverhältnis von 2H:2H, also 1:1. **Dies passt perfekt.**\n    *   **Aliphatischer Bereich**: In der 1:1-Mischung stammen die aliphatischen Protonen von beiden Verbindungen. Die Gesamtzahl der Methylprotonen beträgt 12 (von 1,2,4,5-) + 12 (von 1,2,3,5-) = 24. Das angegebene Verhältnis von 2:1:1 bedeutet, dass die Integrale der drei Signale 12H, 6H und 6H sein müssen ((2/4)*24H=12H, (1/4)*24H=6H, (1/4)*24H=6H).\n        *   1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzol liefert ein Singulett mit einem Integral von **12H**.\n        *   1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzol liefert Signale mit Integralen von **6H**, 3H und 3H.\n        *   Um die beobachteten drei Signale (12H, 6H, 6H) zu erhalten, muss das 12H-Signal von 1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzol, das 6H-Signal von 1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzol und ein weiteres 6H-Signal vorhanden sein. Dieses dritte Signal muss aus der zufälligen Überlagerung (gleiche chemische Verschiebung) der beiden 3H-Signale von 1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzol resultieren.\n\nDiese Kombination ist die einzige, die mit den Spektraldaten übereinstimmt.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nAn analysis of the 1H NMR spectra for each of the potential compounds is required to solve this problem. We are looking for a 1:1 mixture of two compounds that matches the following spectral data:\n\n*   **Aromatic region:** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio (~6.7 ppm).\n*   **Aliphatic region:** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio (~2.2 ppm).\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n\nLet's analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each option:\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single singlet (representing 2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups are also chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce a single singlet (representing 12H).\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has less symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments and are not equivalent. This would result in two separate aromatic singlets (each representing 1H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are in unique chemical environments, which would lead to four different aliphatic singlets.\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 4 aliphatic singlets (3H each).\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce a single singlet (representing 2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The methyl groups at positions 1 and 4 are equivalent, and the methyl groups at positions 2 and 3 are equivalent. This results in two distinct aliphatic singlets (each representing 6H).\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 aliphatic singlets (6H each).\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are chemically equivalent, producing a single singlet (4H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The protons of the ethyl groups will show splitting. The two CH2 groups are equivalent and will appear as a quartet, while the two CH3 groups are equivalent and will appear as a triplet. This does not match the \"all singlets\" description for the aliphatic region. Therefore, this compound can be eliminated.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the mixtures presented in the options:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** This mixture would produce three aromatic signals (one 2H singlet from 1,2,3,4-TMB and two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB), which contradicts the data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** This mixture would also produce three aromatic signals (one 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB and two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB), contradicting the data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet, and 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. Assuming their chemical shifts are different, this will result in **two singlets**. Since it is a 1:1 molar mixture and both signals represent 2H, their integration ratio will be **1:1**. This perfectly matches the aromatic data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (12H), and 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H each). This results in a total of **three aliphatic singlets**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Ratio:** In a 1:1 mixture, the ratio of protons in these three signals will be 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches the aliphatic data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** This option is incorrect because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not give only singlets in its aliphatic region.\n\nTherefore, the only pair that fits all the spectral data is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Analyze the given 1H NMR data:**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture:** 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integral ratio. This indicates that each of the two compounds in the mixture has chemically equivalent aromatic protons, giving rise to a singlet. Since the mixture is 1:1 and the signals have a 1:1 ratio, the number of aromatic protons in each compound must be the same.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integral ratio. These signals must come from the methyl (or ethyl) groups of the two compounds combined.\n\n**2. Analyze the 1H NMR spectrum of each possible compound:**\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Formula:** C10H14. Correct.\n    *   **Symmetry:** Very high. There are two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C3 and C6 are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Formula:** C10H14. Correct.\n    *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry passes through the C2 and C5 methyl groups.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three sets of non-equivalent methyl groups:\n        *   C1 and C3 methyls are equivalent (6H).\n        *   C2 methyl is unique (3H).\n        *   C5 methyl is unique (3H).\n        *   This gives **three singlets** with an integral ratio of 6:3:3, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Formula:** C10H14. Correct.\n    *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two sets of non-equivalent methyl groups:\n        *   C1 and C4 methyls are equivalent (6H).\n        *   C2 and C3 methyls are equivalent (6H).\n        *   This gives **two singlets** with an integral ratio of 6:6, which simplifies to **1:1**.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Formula:** C10H14. Correct.\n    *   **Symmetry:** Very high.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four protons on the ring are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet (4H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The ethyl groups are not singlets. The -CH2- protons will be a quartet and the -CH3 protons will be a triplet. The problem explicitly states that all signals in the aliphatic region are singlets, so **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**. This rules out option C.\n\n**3. Evaluate the mixtures:**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that gives:\n*   **Aromatic:** Two singlets (1:1 ratio). All three tetramethylbenzene isomers give a 2H singlet. A 1:1 mixture of any two will result in two singlets with a 1:1 integral ratio (2H:2H). So, this information alone is not enough to distinguish between options A, B, and D.\n*   **Aliphatic:** Three singlets (2:1:1 ratio). Let's check the combinations.\n\nLet's assume there is no accidental overlap of signals from the different compounds.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   1,2,4,5- gives one aliphatic singlet (12H).\n    *   1,2,3,5- gives three aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   Total signals = 1 + 3 = 4 aliphatic singlets. This does not match the data (three signals).\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   1,2,3,4- gives two aliphatic singlets (6H, 6H).\n    *   1,2,3,5- gives three aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   Total signals = 2 + 3 = 5 aliphatic singlets (unless there is overlap). This does not match the data (three signals).\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   1,2,4,5- gives **one** aliphatic singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,4- gives **two** aliphatic singlets.\n    *   Total signals = 1 + 2 = **three** aliphatic singlets. This matches the number of signals observed.\n    *   Let's check the ratio. The signals correspond to:\n        *   One 12H singlet (from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene).\n        *   One 6H singlet (from 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene).\n        *   Another 6H singlet (from 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene).\n    *   The integral ratio is 12H:6H:6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match for the aliphatic region data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only one that perfectly accounts for all the features of the given 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the two compounds in the mixture:\n\n### **1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's break down the information provided from the 1H NMR spectrum of the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. This indicates that there are two distinct types of aromatic protons in the mixture, and the total number of protons for each signal is the same.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. This points to three different types of methyl groups in the mixture.\n\n### **2. Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum of Each Option**\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds. All compounds have the molecular formula C10H14.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** Due to its high symmetry, it will show:\n    *   **Aromatic:** One singlet (2H), as the protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent.\n    *   **Alkyl:** One singlet (12H), as all four methyl groups are equivalent.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry. It will show:\n    *   **Aromatic:** One singlet (2H), as the protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent.\n    *   **Alkyl:** Two singlets (6H each), corresponding to the two pairs of equivalent methyl groups (C1/C4 and C2/C3). The ratio would be 1:1.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has lower symmetry. It will show:\n    *   **Aromatic:** Two singlets (1H each), for the non-equivalent protons at C4 and C6.\n    *   **Alkyl:** Three singlets with an integration ratio of 2:1:1 (corresponding to 6H for the C1/C3 pair, 3H for the C2 methyl, and 3H for the C5 methyl).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** Due to symmetry, it will show:\n    *   **Aromatic:** One singlet (4H), as all four aromatic protons are equivalent.\n    *   **Alkyl:** A quartet (4H, -CH2-) and a triplet (6H, -CH3-). The presence of quartets and triplets (due to splitting) means this compound can be ruled out, as the problem states only singlets are observed in the alkyl region. This eliminates option **D**.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Remaining Options**\n\nNow, let's consider the NMR spectra for a 1:1 mixture of the remaining pairs.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** One singlet (2H) from 1,2,4,5- and two singlets (1H each) from 1,2,3,5-. This would result in three signals, which contradicts the data.\n    *   **Alkyl signals:** One singlet (12H) from 1,2,4,5- and three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H) from 1,2,3,5-. This would result in four distinct signals. This does not match the observed spectrum.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** One singlet (2H) from 1,2,3,4- and two singlets (1H each) from 1,2,3,5-. This would result in three signals, which is inconsistent with the data.\n    *   **Alkyl signals:** Two singlets (6H each) from 1,2,3,4- and three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H) from 1,2,3,5-. This combination does not readily produce a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one singlet for its 2 aromatic protons. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene also provides one singlet for its 2 aromatic protons. In a 1:1 mixture, these two non-equivalent singlets would each correspond to 2 protons, resulting in the observed **two singlets in a 1:1 ratio**.\n    *   **Alkyl signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one singlet for its 12 methyl protons. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene gives two singlets, each for 6 methyl protons. Combining these gives three singlets with integrations corresponding to 12H, 6H, and 6H. This simplifies to the observed **2:1:1 ratio**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only one that perfectly matches both the aromatic and alkyl region data from the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the predicted 1H NMR spectra for each of the possible compounds and then see which 1:1 mixture would produce the spectrum described.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the given NMR data:**\n    *   Molecular Formula: C10H14 for both compounds.\n    *   Aromatic region: Two singlets with a 1:1 integral ratio. This means each compound in the 1:1 mixture must contribute one aromatic singlet, and each of these singlets must correspond to the same number of protons.\n    *   Aliphatic region: Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integral ratio. These signals must arise from the methyl/ethyl groups of the two compounds combined.\n\n2.  **Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each candidate molecule:**\n    *   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** Due to high symmetry, it will show one singlet for the two aromatic protons (H-3, H-6) and one singlet for the twelve protons of the four equivalent methyl groups.\n    *   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** Due to a single plane of symmetry, it will show one singlet for the two equivalent aromatic protons (H-4, H-6) and three singlets for the methyl groups (one for 6H from Me-1 and Me-3, one for 3H from Me-2, and one for 3H from Me-5), with an integral ratio of 2:1:1.\n    *   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** Due to symmetry, it will show one singlet for the two equivalent aromatic protons (H-5, H-6) and two singlets for the methyl groups (one for 6H from Me-1 and Me-4, and one for 6H from Me-2 and Me-3), with an integral ratio of 1:1.\n    *   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** It will show one singlet for the four equivalent aromatic protons. The ethyl groups will show a quartet (for the 4H of the two CH2 groups) and a triplet (for the 6H of the two CH3 groups). The presence of a quartet and triplet rules this compound out, as the problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the options based on a 1:1 mixture:**\n    *   We will combine the predicted spectra for the compounds in each option and compare the result to the experimental data.\n\n```python\ndef solve_nmr_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes potential compounds to match a given 1H NMR spectrum of a mixture.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing the problem based on the 1H NMR data for a 1:1 mixture of two C10H14 isomers.\")\n    print(\"Experimental Data:\")\n    print(\"- Aromatic region (~6.7 ppm): 2 singlets, 1:1 ratio.\")\n    print(\"- Aliphatic region (~2.2 ppm): 3 singlets, 2:1:1 ratio.\\n\")\n\n    # Predicted spectra for individual compounds\n    spectra = {\n        \"1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\": {\n            \"Aromatic H\": \"1 singlet (2H)\",\n            \"Aliphatic H\": \"1 singlet (12H)\",\n            \"Aliphatic Signals\": 1,\n            \"Aliphatic Integrals\": [12]\n        },\n        \"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\": {\n            \"Aromatic H\": \"1 singlet (2H)\",\n            \"Aliphatic H\": \"3 singlets (6H, 3H, 3H -> ratio 2:1:1)\",\n            \"Aliphatic Signals\": 3,\n            \"Aliphatic Integrals\": [6, 3, 3]\n        },\n        \"1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\": {\n            \"Aromatic H\": \"1 singlet (2H)\",\n            \"Aliphatic H\": \"2 singlets (6H, 6H -> ratio 1:1)\",\n            \"Aliphatic Signals\": 2,\n            \"Aliphatic Integrals\": [6, 6]\n        },\n        \"1,4-diethylbenzene\": {\n            \"Aromatic H\": \"1 singlet (4H)\",\n            \"Aliphatic H\": \"1 quartet (4H) and 1 triplet (6H)\",\n            \"Aliphatic Signals\": \"Non-singlets\",\n            \"Aliphatic Integrals\": []\n        }\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Predicted spectra for individual compounds:\")\n    for compound, spec in spectra.items():\n        print(f\"- {compound}:\")\n        print(f\"  Aromatic: {spec['Aromatic H']}\")\n        print(f\"  Aliphatic: {spec['Aliphatic H']}\")\n    print(\"\\nNote: 1,4-diethylbenzene is ruled out as it produces non-singlet signals (a quartet and a triplet) in the aliphatic region.\\n\")\n\n    # Options Analysis\n    options = {\n        \"A\": [\"1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\"],\n        \"B\": [\"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,4-diethylbenzene\"],\n        \"C\": [\"1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\"],\n        \"D\": [\"1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\"]\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Evaluating the options for a 1:1 mixture:\")\n    correct_option = None\n    for option, compounds in options.items():\n        print(f\"--- Option {option}: {compounds[0]} and {compounds[1]} ---\")\n        \n        # Check if any compound is invalid\n        if spectra[compounds[0]]['Aliphatic Signals'] == 'Non-singlets' or spectra[compounds[1]]['Aliphatic Signals'] == 'Non-singlets':\n            print(\"Result: Does not match.

The 1H NMR spectrum of this mixture shows:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** The integration ratios (1:1 for aromatic, 2:1:1 for aliphatic) refer to the total protons from *both* compounds in the mixture contributing to those signals.\n**Careful Point 2:** The splitting pattern is crucial. The presence of only singlets in the aliphatic region is a major clue.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum of Each Potential Compound Individually**\n\nLet's predict the spectrum for each of the four given options.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High symmetry (D2h).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four ring protons are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they appear as **one singlet (4H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The CH2 protons are split by the CH3 protons, giving a **quartet (4H)**. The CH3 protons are split by the CH2 protons, giving a **triplet (6H)**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound gives a quartet and a triplet. The problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene cannot be one of the compounds**. This eliminates option B.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High symmetry (D2h).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent. They have no adjacent protons. They will appear as **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry (C2v).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. Although they are adjacent, coupled equivalent protons appear as a singlet. So, they give **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. They give **one singlet (6H)**.\n        *   The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent. They give **one singlet (6H)**.\n        *   Total aliphatic signals: Two singlets in a 6H:6H (or 1:1) ratio.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry (Cs).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The proton at C4 and the proton at C6 are not equivalent. Neither has an adjacent proton. This results in **two singlets (each 1H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent. They give **one singlet (6H)**.\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique. It gives **one singlet (3H)**.\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique. It gives **one singlet (3H)**.\n        *   Total aliphatic signals: Three singlets in a 6H:3H:3H (or 2:1:1) ratio.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the 1:1 Mixtures based on the Individual Spectra**\n\nNow, let's test the remaining options (A, C, and D) by combining the predicted spectra for a 1:1 mixture.\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene) + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** Prehnitene gives one singlet (2H). Isodurene gives two singlets (1H each). The mixture would show three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio (assuming no overlap). This contradicts the data of \"two singlets in a 1:1 ratio\".\n\n*   **Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** Durene gives one singlet (2H). Isodurene gives two singlets (1H each). The mixture would show three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio (assuming no overlap). This contradicts the data of \"two singlets in a 1:1 ratio\".\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) + 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:**\n        *   Durene gives one singlet for its 2 aromatic protons.\n        *   Prehnitene gives one singlet for its 2 aromatic protons.\n        *   Assuming they have different chemical shifts, the mixture will show **two singlets**.\n        *   Since it is a 1:1 mixture, each singlet represents 2H. The integration ratio is 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This perfectly matches the experimental data.\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:**\n        *   Durene gives one singlet for its 12 methyl protons.\n        *   Prehnitene gives two separate singlets, each for 6 methyl protons.\n        *   In total, the mixture will show **three singlets**.\n        *   The integrations will be 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only combination that produces the 1H NMR spectrum described in the problem.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Information Provided in the 1H NMR Spectrum\n\nWe are given the spectrum of a 1:1 molar mixture of two compounds. Let's denote the two unknown compounds as A and B.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds have the formula C10H14.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals, both singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n    *   Since the mixture is 1:1, let's say we have 1 mole of compound A and 1 mole of compound B.\n    *   The total number of aromatic protons must be an even number. Two signals in a 1:1 ratio means that the number of protons contributing to the first signal is equal to the number of protons contributing to the second signal.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n    *   This tells us there are three distinct sets of aliphatic protons, and all of them are on carbons with no adjacent protons (hence, they are singlets). This strongly suggests the aliphatic groups are methyl (CH3) groups attached to the aromatic ring, as ethyl groups would show quartets and triplets.\n\n### Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound\n\nWe need to analyze the structure of each of the four possible compounds to predict the number of signals, their multiplicity, and their integration. The key here is to identify the chemical equivalence of protons based on the molecule's symmetry.\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetric. It has two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will produce a single **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups (at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5) are equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce a single **singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H) and 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n2.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They are adjacent (ortho) but since they are equivalent (an AA' system), they appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent, but this pair is different from the C1/C4 pair. This results in two distinct **singlets**, each integrating to **6H**.\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H) and 2 alkyl singlets (6H each).\n\n3.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has no elements of symmetry (besides identity).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The proton at C4 and the proton at C6 are in different chemical environments. They will produce two distinct **singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups (at C1, C2, C3, and C5) are in unique environments. This will result in four distinct **singlets**, each integrating to **3H**.\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each) and 4 alkyl singlets (3H each).\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High symmetry, similar to durene.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** This compound has ethyl groups. The CH2 protons will be a quartet and the CH3 protons will be a triplet.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The problem states that the aliphatic signals are all singlets. Therefore, any option containing 1,4-diethylbenzene can be immediately eliminated. This rules out option A.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Spectra of the Proposed Mixtures\n\nNow we evaluate the remaining options by combining the predicted spectra in a 1:1 ratio. The total number of aliphatic (methyl) protons in any 1:1 mixture will be 12 + 12 = 24.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region Goal:** Two singlets with a 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic Region Goal:** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio. For 24 total protons, this corresponds to integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n**Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n\n*   **Aromatic Signals:**\n    *   Durene contributes one 2H singlet.\n    *   Prehnitene contributes one 2H singlet.\n    *   Assuming these have different chemical shifts, the mixture will show **two singlets**, each corresponding to 2H. This gives a **1:1 ratio**. This matches the experimental data perfectly.\n*   **Aliphatic Signals:**\n    *   Durene contributes one 12H singlet.\n    *   Prehnitene contributes two 6H singlets.\n    *   If all three of these singlets have different chemical shifts, the mixture will show **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. This gives a **2:1:1 ratio** (12:6:6). This also matches the experimental data perfectly.\n\nThis combination of compounds provides a perfect explanation for all the spectral data without requiring any unusual coincidental signal overlaps.\n\nLet's quickly check why other options fail:\n\n*   **Option B (Durene + Isodurene):** Would give three aromatic signals (2H, 1H, 1H), not two.\n*   **Option C (Prehnitene + Isodurene):** Would give three aromatic signals (2H, 1H, 1H), not two.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only pair of compounds that produces the described 1H NMR spectrum in a 1:1 mixture is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nTo solve this problem, we must analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each potential compound and then determine which 1:1 mixture matches the provided spectral data.\n\n### Analysis of Individual Compounds\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Due to its high symmetry, there is only one type of aromatic proton and one type of methyl proton.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons on the ring are equivalent, leading to a single signal (a 2H singlet).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups are equivalent, resulting in a single signal (a 12H singlet).\n    *   **Summary:** One 2H aromatic singlet, one 12H aliphatic singlet.\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** There are two distinct aromatic protons which are not coupled to each other. This results in two separate 1H singlets.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1 and C3 (6H), the one at C2 (3H), and the one at C5 (3H). This leads to three aliphatic singlets with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n    *   **Summary:** Two 1H aromatic singlets, three aliphatic singlets (2:1:1 ratio).\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two aromatic protons at C5 and C6 are chemically equivalent. They are adjacent, forming an AA' system that appears as a single 2H signal, which is typically observed as a singlet in low-resolution spectra.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1 and C4 (6H) and the pair at C2 and C3 (6H). This gives two aliphatic singlets with a 6H:6H integration ratio, which simplifies to 1:1.\n    *   **Summary:** One 2H aromatic singlet, two 1H aliphatic singlets (1:1 ratio).\n\n4.  **1,4-Diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are equivalent due to symmetry and produce a single 4H singlet.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The spectrum shows characteristic signals for an ethyl group: a quartet for the -CH2- protons and a triplet for the -CH3- protons. This does not match the problem's description of only singlets in the aliphatic region.\n    *   **Summary:** One 4H aromatic singlet, one 4H aliphatic quartet, and one 6H aliphatic triplet. This compound can be eliminated.\n\n### Analysis of the 1:1 Mixture\n\nThe spectrum of the 1:1 mixture shows:\n*   **Aromatic region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nLet's test the remaining options:\n\n*   **Option A (1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB):** The aromatic region would contain a 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB and two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB. This would result in three signals with a 2:1:1 ratio, which contradicts the observed data.\n\n*   **Option B (1,2,3,4-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB):** The aromatic region would contain a 2H singlet from 1,2,3,4-TMB and two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB. This would also result in three signals with a 2:1:1 ratio, which is inconsistent with the data.\n\n*   **Option C (1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,4-TMB):**\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** 1,2,4,5-TMB provides one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB also provides one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this combination would produce two singlets, each integrating to 2H. The ratio of these two signals would be 1:1, perfectly matching the description.\n    *   **Aliphatic Spectrum:** 1,2,4,5-TMB provides one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB provides two 6H singlets. The combined spectrum would exhibit three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio of these signals is 12:6:6, which simplifies to 2:1:1. This also perfectly matches the description.\n\n*   **Option D (1,2,3,5-TMB + 1,4-diethylbenzene):** This option is ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce only singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\nBased on this analysis, the mixture must contain 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nTo determine which two compounds are in the mixture, we must analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each of the potential compounds and compare it to the data provided.\n\nThe experimental data for the 1:1 mixture is:\n*   **Aromatic region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets in a 1:1 integral ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 integral ratio.\n\nThis implies that each compound in the 1:1 mixture contributes one aromatic singlet, and the protons responsible for each of these singlets are equal in number. Let's analyze the spectra of the candidate molecules.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** Due to its high symmetry, the two aromatic protons are chemically equivalent, producing a single signal. The four methyl groups are also equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** One singlet (2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** One singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that makes the two aromatic protons (at positions 5 and 6) equivalent. This results in a single aromatic signal. The four methyl groups are in two different chemical environments (1- and 4-methyl groups are equivalent, and 2- and 3-methyl groups are equivalent).\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** One singlet (2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** Two singlets (6H each).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule is unsymmetrical. The two aromatic protons (at positions 4 and 6) are in different chemical environments. Therefore, it would show two signals in the aromatic region.\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Two singlets (1H each).\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** Multiple singlets.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** Due to symmetry, the four aromatic protons are equivalent, giving one signal. The two ethyl groups are equivalent, but each ethyl group shows a quartet for the -CH2- group and a triplet for the -CH3- group due to spin-spin splitting. The problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets.\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** One singlet (4H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** One quartet (4H) and one triplet (6H).\n\n**Analysis of the Mixture**\n\nLet's test the combination from option C, which includes **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**, in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one singlet (for 2 protons).\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene provides one singlet (for 2 protons).\n    *   The mixture would show **two distinct singlets**. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio and each signal represents 2 protons, the integration ratio would be **1:1**. This matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one singlet (for 12 protons).\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene provides two singlets (each for 6 protons).\n    *   The mixture would show a total of **three singlets** in the aliphatic region (assuming they have different chemical shifts).\n    *   The relative integration of these signals would be based on the number of protons they represent: 12H, 6H, and 6H. This simplifies to a ratio of **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\nNo other combination of the given options fits the spectral data. For instance, any mixture containing 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene would result in three aromatic signals in total, and any mixture with 1,4-diethylbenzene would show quartets and triplets instead of only singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\nTherefore, the two compounds present in the mixture are 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nTo solve this, we must determine the expected 1H NMR signals for each potential compound and then see which 1:1 mixture matches the spectral data provided.\n\n### Analysis of the Provided NMR Data\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:** The spectrum shows two singlets at ~6.7 ppm with a 1:1 integral ratio. This means the mixture contains two different types of aromatic protons, and they are present in equal amounts. A singlet indicates that these protons have no adjacent proton neighbors.\n*   **Alkyl Region:** The spectrum displays three singlets at ~2.2 ppm with a 2:1:1 integral ratio. These signals correspond to the methyl (–CH₃) groups on the benzene rings. Singlets here indicate the methyl groups are not adjacent to any non-equivalent protons.\n\n### Predicted 1H NMR Spectra for Each Compound\n\nLet's analyze the expected spectrum for each of the four compounds based on their molecular symmetry.\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single signal. Since they have no adjacent protons, this signal will be a **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are also chemically equivalent due to symmetry. This will result in a **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has less symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments and have no adjacent proton neighbors. This results in **two separate singlets (1H each)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at positions 1 and 3 are equivalent to each other. The methyl group at position 2 is unique, and the methyl group at position 5 is unique. This leads to **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent due to a plane of symmetry. Equivalent protons do not split each other, so they produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at 1 and 4 are equivalent, and the methyl groups at 2 and 3 are equivalent. This results in **two singlets** with a 6H:6H or **1:1** integration ratio.\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four aromatic protons are chemically equivalent due to symmetry, producing **one singlet (4H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. Each ethyl group consists of a methylene (–CH₂–) and a methyl (–CH₃) group. These would produce a quartet and a triplet, not singlets. This compound can be eliminated immediately based on the alkyl region data.\n\n### Evaluating the Mixtures\n\nNow, let's determine which 1:1 mixture corresponds to the observed spectrum.\n\n*   The data shows **three alkyl singlets** in a **2:1:1 ratio**. Looking at our individual analyses, only **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene** produces this exact pattern on its own.\n*   The data also shows **two aromatic singlets** in a **1:1 ratio**.\n    *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene by itself has two aromatic singlets, but their integrals would be 1H each.\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene has one aromatic singlet with an integral of 2H.\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene has one aromatic singlet with an integral of 2H.\n\nLet's test the option containing 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene alongside another compound that could fit the remaining data.\n\n**Consider the mixture in Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.**\n\n*   **Alkyl Region:**\n    *   From 1,2,3,5-TMB: Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio (representing 6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   From 1,2,4,5-TMB: One singlet (representing 12H).\n    *   The combined spectrum would show four signals, which contradicts the data.\n\nThere seems to be a contradiction. Let's re-read the prompt carefully. *\"...three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio.\"* This ratio describes the signals for the **entire mixture**. Let's reconsider how the signals combine in a 1:1 mixture. The total number of protons for each compound is 14.\n\n**Re-evaluating Option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.**\n\n*   **Component 1 (1,2,4,5-TMB):** Aromatic: 1 singlet (2H). Alkyl: 1 singlet (12H).\n*   **Component 2 (1,2,3,4-TMB):** Aromatic: 1 singlet (2H). Alkyl: 2 singlets (6H each).\n\nLet's combine them in a 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Aromatic Spectrum:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives another 2H singlet. If these have different chemical shifts, we will see **two singlets**, each corresponding to 2H. This gives an **integral ratio of 1:1**. This perfectly matches the aromatic data.\n*   **Alkyl Spectrum:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets. This creates a total of **three singlets** with integrals in the ratio **12H : 6H : 6H**. This simplifies to a **2:1:1 ratio**. This perfectly matches the alkyl data.\n\nTherefore, the mixture consists of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula and Initial Information**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation (DoU) to understand the basic structure.\n    DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 10 + 1 - (14/2) = 11 - 7 = 4.\n*   A DoU of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring. All the given options are derivatives of benzene, which is consistent with this.\n*   The problem states there is a 1:1 mixture of two of these compounds.\n\n**2. Analyze the 1H NMR Data - Aromatic Region**\n\n*   **Signals:** Two singlets around 6.7 ppm.\n*   **Ratio:** 1:1.\n*   **Interpretation:** Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, a 1:1 signal ratio means that the number of protons creating the first singlet is equal to the number of protons creating the second singlet. Each compound must contribute one singlet in the aromatic region, and each of these singlets must correspond to the same number of protons.\n\nLet's predict the aromatic signals for each candidate compound:\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** This molecule is highly symmetrical. The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a single **singlet** corresponding to **2H**.\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry through C2 and C5. The protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a single **singlet** corresponding to **2H**.\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry between C2-C3 and C5-C6. The protons at C5 and C6 are equivalent. Although they are adjacent, chemically equivalent protons do not split each other in a first-order spectrum, so they appear as a single **singlet** corresponding to **2H**.\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. The four aromatic protons are all chemically equivalent and will appear as a single **singlet** corresponding to **4H**.\n\nA mixture of any of the tetramethylbenzene isomers (all 2H) with 1,4-diethylbenzene (4H) would give an aromatic signal ratio of 2:4 or 1:2. This contradicts the observed 1:1 ratio. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene is not present in the mixture**, which eliminates option **D**.\n\nThe mixture must contain two different tetramethylbenzene isomers. Any pair of them will have different chemical environments for their aromatic protons, leading to two distinct singlets. Since both singlets come from 2H, their integration ratio will be 1:1, matching the data.\n\n**3. Analyze the 1H NMR Data - Aliphatic Region**\n\n*   **Signals:** Three singlets around 2.2 ppm.\n*   **Ratio:** 2:1:1.\n*   **Interpretation:** The signals are from the methyl (-CH3) groups.\n    *   Each tetramethylbenzene isomer has 4 methyl groups, totaling 12 protons.\n    *   In a 1:1 mixture, there are 12 + 12 = 24 aliphatic protons in total.\n    *   The ratio is 2:1:1. The sum of the ratio parts is 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.\n    *   We can calculate the number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Signal 1 (ratio 2): (2/4) * 24H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n    *   So, the combination of the two isomers must produce three singlets with integrations corresponding to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\nLet's predict the aliphatic signals for each remaining candidate:\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene:** Due to its high symmetry, all four methyl groups are equivalent. It will show **one singlet for 12H**.\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:** Due to a plane of symmetry, there are two sets of equivalent methyl groups (the inner two and the outer two). It will show **two singlets, each for 6H**.\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** Due to a plane of symmetry, there are three sets of chemically different methyl groups. It will show **three singlets for 6H, 3H, and 3H**.\n\n**4. Identify the Correct Pair**\n\nNow we must find which pair of compounds, when mixed, gives the required set of signals {12H singlet, 6H singlet, 6H singlet}. We do this by combining the predicted signals from each compound in the pair.\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: one 12H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: two 6H singlets.\n    *   Combined signals: one 12H singlet, two 6H singlets.\n    *   This gives a total of three signals with an integration ratio of 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: two 6H singlets.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined signals: three 6H singlets and two 3H singlets. This would give five signals (or fewer if there is accidental overlap), which does not match the \"three signals\" described.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: one 12H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined signals: one 12H singlet, one 6H singlet, and two 3H singlets. This would give four signals, not three.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only combination that produces an aliphatic spectrum with three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio is the mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nThe user wants me to identify a pair of aromatic compounds from a given list that, in a 1:1 mixture, would produce a specific 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n### 1.

Analyze the Candidate Compounds\n\nFirst, let's verify that all candidate compounds have the molecular formula C10H14.\n- Tetramethylbenzene: C6H2(CH3)4 = C6H2 + C4H12 = C10H14. Correct.\n- Diethylbenzene: C6H4(C2H5)2 = C6H4 + C4H10 = C10H14. Correct.\n\nNext, let's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each individual compound based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 are all chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry passing through the carbons at positions 2 and 5.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        *   The methyl groups at positions 1 and 3 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyl group at position 2 is unique (3H).\n        *   The methyl group at position 5 is unique (3H).\n        *   This will produce **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        *   The methyl groups at positions 1 and 4 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyl groups at positions 2 and 3 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   This will produce **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which simplifies to **1:1**.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four protons at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6 are all chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** integrating to **4H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The methylene (CH2) protons will be a **quartet** (split by CH3) and the methyl (CH3) protons will be a **triplet** (split by CH2).\n    *   The problem states that all signals in the aliphatic region are singlets. Therefore, any option containing 1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated.\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Mixtures in Each Option\n\nNow, let's analyze the spectrum that would result from a 1:1 mixture of the compounds in each option.\n\n**A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n*   This option is incorrect because 1,4-diethylbenzene produces a quartet and a triplet, not singlets, in the aliphatic region.\n\n**B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   **Aromatic:** Prehnitene (2H singlet) + Isodurene (2H singlet). This gives two singlets with a 2H:2H or 1:1 integration ratio. This matches the data.\n*   **Aliphatic:** Prehnitene (two 6H singlets) + Isodurene (three singlets of 6H, 3H, 3H). This would result in up to five signals, not the three signals described. It cannot be combined to produce a 2:1:1 ratio. This contradicts the data.\n\n**C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   **Aromatic:** Durene (2H singlet) + Prehnitene (2H singlet). This gives two singlets with a 2H:2H or 1:1 integration ratio. **This matches the data.**\n*   **Aliphatic:** Durene (one 12H singlet) + Prehnitene (two 6H singlets). Assuming the chemical shifts are different, this mixture would produce exactly three singlets. The integrations would be 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This perfectly matches the data.**\n\n**D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   **Aromatic:** Durene (2H singlet) + Isodurene (2H singlet). This gives two singlets with a 2H:2H or 1:1 integration ratio. This matches the data.\n*   **Aliphatic:** Durene (one 12H singlet) + Isodurene (three singlets of 6H, 3H, 3H). This combination would result in four signals with integrations of 12H, 6H, 3H, and 3H (ratio 4:2:1:1). This contradicts the data.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe only pair of compounds that produces the described 1H NMR spectrum in a 1:1 mixture is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nThis problem requires a detailed analysis of the expected ¹H NMR spectra for several isomers of tetramethylbenzene and diethylbenzene to determine which two compounds are present in a 1:1 mixture.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Reasoning**\n\n**1. Analyze the Experimental NMR Data**\n\n*   **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar ratio of two C₁₀H₁₄ isomers.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals.\n    *   Both are singlets.\n    *   They have an integration ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals.\n    *   All are singlets.\n    *   They have an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\nThe most crucial piece of information is that **all signals are singlets**. This severely constrains the possible structures, as it implies that no protons are coupled to adjacent, non-equivalent protons.\n\n**2. Predict the ¹H NMR Spectra of the Candidate Compounds**\n\nLet's evaluate each option to see if it would produce only singlets.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule contains ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃). The protons of the -CH₂- group are adjacent to the three protons of the -CH₃ group and will be split into a quartet. The protons of the -CH₃ group will be split by the -CH₂- group into a triplet.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound would produce quartets and triplets, not just singlets. It can be **eliminated**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule has two aromatic protons at positions C5 and C6. These two protons are adjacent to each other. They will magnetically couple and split each other's signal, resulting in a pair of doublets (not singlets).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound would not produce singlets in the aromatic region. It can be **eliminated**.\n\nBy eliminating two of the four options, we can deduce that the mixture must contain the remaining two compounds: **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**. Now, we must verify that a 1:1 mixture of these two would produce the observed spectrum.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C3 and C6 are chemically equivalent and have no adjacent protons. They produce **one singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet** integrating to 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has a single plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent and have no adjacent protons. They produce **one singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct types of methyl groups:\n        1.  The two methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent: **one singlet (6H)**.\n        2.  The methyl group at C2 is unique: **one singlet (3H)**.\n        3.  The methyl group at C5 is unique: **one singlet (3H)**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Predicted Spectrum of the 1:1 Mixture**\n\nLet's combine the predicted spectra for a 1:1 molar mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB provides one 2H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB provides one 2H singlet.\n    *   Since these singlets come from different molecules, they will have slightly different chemical shifts. As the mixture is 1:1 and each signal represents 2H, their integration ratio will be 1:1.\n    *   This result (two singlets in a 1:1 ratio) **matches the experimental data perfectly.**\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB provides one singlet for 12H.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB provides three singlets for 6H, 3H, and 3H.\n    *   The problem states that only three signals are observed with a 2:1:1 ratio. This implies an accidental overlap of two signals.\n    *   Let's check the integrations. The signals available are with relative proton counts of 12, 6, 3, and 3.\n    *   To get three signals, the two 3H signals from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene must overlap to form a single peak with an integration of 6H.\n    *   The resulting signals would have integrations corresponding to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   The ratio of these signals is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   This result **matches the experimental data perfectly.**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nA 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene is the only combination that can account for all the features of the observed ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Experimental 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's break down the information given from the 1H NMR spectrum of the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are isomers with the formula C10H14. All four options fit this formula.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals, both are singlets, and their integration ratio is 1:1. This indicates two distinct types of aromatic protons in the mixture, and the total number of protons for each signal is equal.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all are singlets, and their integration ratio is 2:1:1. This indicates three distinct types of methyl group protons in the mixture. The signals must all be singlets, meaning no splitting from adjacent protons.\n\n**2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nWe need to analyze the structure and symmetry of each compound to predict the number of signals, their integration, and multiplicity.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are also chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **12H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has less symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. They will produce **two distinct singlets**, each with an integration of **1H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the two equivalent methyls at C1/C3 (6H), the methyl at C2 (3H), and the methyl at C5 (3H). This will produce **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two adjacent protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent methyls at C1/C4 (6H) and the equivalent methyls at C2/C3 (6H). This will produce **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, or **1:1**.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four protons on the ring are equivalent, producing **one singlet** with an integration of **4H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The signal for the CH2 groups will be a **quartet** (split by the CH3), and the signal for the CH3 groups will be a **triplet** (split by the CH2). The problem states all alkyl signals are singlets, so this compound can be eliminated immediately.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options by Combining the Spectra**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **Eliminate Option A:** This option includes 1,4-diethylbenzene, which would show a quartet and a triplet in the alkyl region. The observed spectrum only has singlets. So, A is incorrect.\n\n*   **Eliminate Options B and C:** These options both include 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. This compound *by itself* produces two aromatic singlets. When mixed with another compound that also has aromatic protons (like 1,2,3,4-TMB or 1,2,4,5-TMB), the mixture would be expected to show at least three aromatic signals (unless there is an accidental overlap of signals, which is less likely). The problem explicitly states there are only two aromatic signals.\n\n*   **Evaluate Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet for 2H.\n        *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet for 2H.\n        *   A 1:1 mixture of these two will show **two singlets**. Since each signal corresponds to 2H, their integration ratio will be 2:2, or **1:1**. This is a perfect match with the experimental data.\n    *   **Alkyl Region:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet for 12H.\n        *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes two singlets, each for 6H.\n        *   A 1:1 mixture will therefore show **three singlets** in total (assuming they have different chemical shifts). The integrations will be 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio of these integrals is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is also a perfect match with the experimental data.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only option that perfectly explains the observed 1H NMR spectrum without requiring any assumptions of accidental signal overlap.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nTo determine the correct pair of compounds, we must analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each substance and see which 1:1 mixture matches the provided spectral data.\n\n**Given Spectral Data:**\n*   **Aromatic Region:** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio around 6.7 ppm.\n*   **Aliphatic Region:** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio around 2.2 ppm.\n*   All compounds have the molecular formula C10H14.\n\n**Analysis of Each Compound's Expected 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   Due to its high symmetry, all four methyl groups are chemically equivalent, producing a single sharp peak in the aliphatic region. This singlet integrates to 12 protons.\n    *   The two aromatic protons are also equivalent, resulting in one singlet in the aromatic region, integrating to 2 protons.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at positions 1 and 3 are equivalent (6H), the one at position 2 is unique (3H), and the one at position 5 is unique (3H). This results in three aliphatic singlets with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n    *   The two aromatic protons (at C4 and C6) are equivalent, producing one singlet (2H).\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 3 aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H; ratio 2:1:1).\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: the pair at positions 1 and 4 (6H) and the pair at positions 2 and 3 (6H). This gives two aliphatic singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   The two aromatic protons (at C5 and C6) are equivalent, giving one singlet (2H).\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 aliphatic singlets (6H, 6H; ratio 1:1).\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   The aliphatic portion consists of ethyl groups. These will not produce singlets but rather a quartet for the -CH2- protons and a triplet for the -CH3- protons due to spin-spin splitting. This immediately eliminates any option containing this compound.\n\n**Evaluating the 1:1 Mixture Options:**\n\nThe mixture contains two compounds, and in a 1:1 molar ratio, the total number of protons from each compound is equal. All tetramethylbenzene isomers have 14 protons (2 aromatic, 12 aliphatic).\n\n*   **Aromatic Signals:** The mixture shows two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. This is consistent with mixing any two of the tetramethylbenzene isomers, as each contributes one aromatic singlet of 2H intensity.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Signals:** The key to the solution lies here. The mixture has three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. In a 1:1 mixture, the total number of aliphatic protons is 12 + 12 = 24. A 2:1:1 ratio of 24 protons means the signals integrate to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\nLet's examine the options based on the aliphatic signals they would produce in a mixture:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** This mixture would have signals from a 12H singlet (from 1,2,4,5-TMB) and three separate signals of 6H, 3H, and 3H (from 1,2,3,5-TMB). This results in four aliphatic signals, which contradicts the data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** This mixture would exhibit signals of 6H, 6H (from 1,2,3,4-TMB) and 6H, 3H, 3H (from 1,2,3,5-TMB). Even with a potential overlap of the 6H signals, the resulting pattern (e.g., 12H, 6H, 3H, 3H) does not match the required 12H, 6H, 6H integration.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides **one aliphatic singlet of 12H**.\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene provides **two aliphatic singlets, each of 6H**.\n    *   When combined, these produce exactly three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** This option is incorrect because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\nTherefore, the mixture consists of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nTo determine which two compounds are in the mixture, we need to analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each option and compare it to the data provided.\n\n**Analysis of the Provided 1H NMR Data:**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, in a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, in a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n**Analysis of the Candidate Compounds:**\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** Due to its high symmetry, it will show:\n    *   **Aromatic:** One singlet for the two equivalent aromatic protons (at C3 and C6).\n    *   **Aliphatic:** One singlet for the four equivalent methyl groups (12 protons).\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has less symmetry. It will show:\n    *   **Aromatic:** Two singlets for the two non-equivalent aromatic protons (at C4 and C6).\n    *   **Aliphatic:** Three singlets for the three sets of non-equivalent methyl groups (C1/C3-methyls are equivalent, C2-methyl is unique, C5-methyl is unique), with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry. It will show:\n    *   **Aromatic:** One singlet for the two equivalent aromatic protons (at C5 and C6).\n    *   **Aliphatic:** Two singlets for the two sets of equivalent methyl groups (C1/C4-methyls are equivalent, C2/C3-methyls are equivalent), with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, or 1:1.\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has a molecular formula of C10H14 and high symmetry. It will show:\n    *   **Aromatic:** One singlet for the four equivalent aromatic protons.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** A quartet for the methylene (-CH2-) protons and a triplet for the methyl (-CH3) protons. The signals are not singlets, so this compound can be ruled out. This eliminates option D.\n\n**Evaluating the Mixture Options:**\n\nLet's consider a 1:1 mixture for the remaining options:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** This mixture would produce three signals in the aromatic region: one from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (2H) and two from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (1H each). The expected ratio would be 2:1:1. This does not match the observed 1:1 ratio of two singlets.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** This combination would also result in three aromatic signals: one from 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (2H) and two from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (1H each), giving a 2:1:1 ratio. This does not match the experimental data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this will result in **two singlets** with an equal integration, giving a **1:1 ratio**. This matches the description.\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one singlet (from 12 protons). 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene gives two singlets (each from 6 protons). In the 1:1 mixture, this results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to a **2:1:1 ratio**. This also perfectly matches the description.\n\nTherefore, the two compounds present in the mixture are 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n### **1. Analyze the given 1H NMR data**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** The compounds in the 1:1 mixture have the formula C10H14. All four options are isomers with this formula.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this indicates that each compound produces one singlet in the aromatic region. A singlet arises when a proton (or a set of equivalent protons) on the benzene ring has no adjacent protons.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. These signals represent the total methyl (or ethyl) protons from both compounds in the mixture.\n\n### **2. Predict the 1H NMR spectra for each of the candidate compounds**\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent and have no neighboring protons, so they will appear as a single singlet (2H).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce a single singlet (12H).\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:** One aromatic singlet (~6.9-7.0 ppm) and one alkyl singlet (~2.2-2.3 ppm).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** A plane of symmetry passes through the C2 and C5 positions. This makes the protons at C4 and C6 equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a single singlet (2H).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The same plane of symmetry makes the methyl groups at C1 and C3 equivalent (6H total). The methyl group at C2 (3H) is unique, and the methyl group at C5 (3H) is unique. This results in three separate singlets. The integration ratio of these alkyl singlets is 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:** One aromatic singlet (~6.7-6.8 ppm) and three alkyl singlets (~2.2-2.3 ppm) with a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are adjacent to each other. They would couple and split each other's signals, resulting in two doublets (an AX system), not a singlet.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound can be eliminated as it does not produce a singlet in the aromatic region.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four aromatic protons are chemically equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry and will produce a single singlet (4H).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The protons of the ethyl groups will not be singlets. The CH2 protons are adjacent to the CH3 protons, which would result in a quartet (for the CH2) and a triplet (for the CH3).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound can be eliminated because it produces a quartet and a triplet in the alkyl region, not singlets.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the options based on the mixture's spectrum**\n\nBased on the analysis, the two compounds must be chosen from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, as the other two options are inconsistent with the data.\n\nLet's consider a 1:1 mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet.\n    *   Assuming their chemical shifts are slightly different, the 1:1 mixture will show **two singlets of equal intensity (1:1 ratio)**. This perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region:**\n    *   This is the key part of the problem. The spectrum of the mixture shows three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n    *   The spectrum of pure 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene *by itself* produces three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   The spectrum of pure 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene has only one singlet for its 12 methyl protons.\n    *   If these two were mixed, we would expect four signals in the alkyl region (one from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and three from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene), unless there is an accidental overlap of signals.\n    *   There seems to be a misunderstanding of the question's phrasing. \"There are also three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio.\" This could describe the spectrum of *one* of the components, which is then mixed with another.\n\nLet's re-read the prompt carefully: \"The 1H NMR spectrum of a solution containing a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds...exhibits...three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio.\"\n\nThis implies that the *total* alkyl region of the mixture consists of these three signals. Let's reconsider the combination:\n\n*   **Mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. (Matches)\n    *   **Alkyl signals from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** 3 singlets (ratio 2:1:1).\n    *   **Alkyl signal from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene:** 1 singlet.\n    *   The total number of expected alkyl signals is four, not three.\n\nThere must be an overlap. Let's assume the single, large (12H) singlet from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene overlaps with the largest (6H) singlet from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n*   The combined signal would have an integration of 12H + 6H = 18H.\n*   The other two signals from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene would be 3H and 3H.\n*   The resulting ratio would be 18:3:3, which simplifies to 6:1:1. This does not match the observed 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the initial analysis. The most straightforward interpretation is that one of the compounds gives the 2:1:1 alkyl signal pattern, and the other compound's signals are somehow accounted for.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene** perfectly gives three alkyl singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** gives one alkyl singlet.\n\nWhat if the prompt is interpreted such that the total proton environment leads to this final ratio?\nLet the two compounds be A and B in a 1:1 molar ratio.\nThe total number of protons in compound A is 14. The total number in compound B is 14.\nThe aromatic protons are 2H from A and 2H from B, giving the 1:1 ratio.\nThe alkyl protons are 12H from A and 12H from B. Total alkyl protons = 24H.\nThe signals in the alkyl region are in a 2:1:1 ratio. The total parts in this ratio are 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.\nSo, the three signals correspond to:\n*   Signal 1: (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n*   Signal 2: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n*   Signal 3: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n\nNow let's see if we can form these integrals from a 1:1 mixture of two of our valid compounds.\n\n**Mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (one 12H singlet) and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (three singlets of 6H, 3H, 3H):**\n*   Signal A (1,2,4,5-): 12H\n*   Signals B (1,2,3,5-): 6H, 3H, 3H\n*   We need to combine these four signals to get three signals with integrals 12H, 6H, 6H.\n*   This is not possible without splitting a signal. For example, if the 12H signal from A is one of the final signals, we are left with 6H, 3H, 3H, which doesn't make two signals of 6H each. If the 6H from B is one of the final signals, we need to combine 12H, 3H, 3H to make signals of 12H and 6H. This is also not possible.\n\nThere appears to be a flaw in the reasoning or an ambiguity in the question's description. However, let's revisit the simplest interpretation.\n\nThe prompt describes the *overall* spectrum of the mixture.\n*   Aromatic: Two singlets (1:1). This points to two different compounds each having a single type of aromatic proton environment. Both 1,2,4,5- and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene fit this.\n*   Alkyl: Three singlets (2:1:1). The most direct way to get this pattern is if one of the components (1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene) provides exactly this pattern, and the other component's alkyl signal(s) coincidentally overlap with one of these.\n\nLet's assume the mixture is indeed **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**.\n*   **1,2,3,5-isomer** gives:\n    *   Aromatic: 1 singlet (2H) at ~6.7-6.8 ppm\n    *   Alkyl: 3 singlets (6H, 3H, 3H) -> Ratio 2:1:1\n*   **1,2,4,5-isomer** gives:\n    *   Aromatic: 1 singlet (2H) at ~6.9-7.0 ppm\n    *   Alkyl: 1 singlet (12H) at ~2.2-2.3 ppm\n\nThe description of the spectrum *exactly* matches the predicted spectrum of pure 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene *plus* an extra aromatic singlet from another compound. If we add 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, we get the required second aromatic singlet. But we also get a very large (12H) alkyl singlet which is unaccounted for in the \"three signals\" description.\n\nPerhaps the question is poorly posed, and it's intended to be simpler. Let's reconsider the options.\n*   A and D contain 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, which is incorrect.\n*   C contains 1,4-diethylbenzene, which is incorrect.\n*   This leaves only option B as a possibility.\n\nLet's assume option B is correct and try to rationalize the alkyl spectrum. For the mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**, the alkyl region contains:\n*   One 12H singlet from the 1,2,4,5- isomer.\n*   Three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H) from the 1,2,3,5- isomer.\n\nIf the problem states there are only three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio, there must be a coincidental overlap.\nThe only way to get a 2:1:1 ratio from these four signals is if the question is flawed. Let's ignore the integral ratios for a moment.\n*   Mixture of B: **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**. Both give one aromatic singlet, so the mixture gives two. This is correct. The mixture is expected to have four alkyl singlets. The problem states three. This is a contradiction.\n\nLet's re-read the prompt one more time. \"three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio.\" This is the description of the alkyl region of the final 1:1 mixture. As calculated before, a 1:1 mixture means we have 12H of alkyl protons from the first compound and 12H from the second, for a total of 24H. A 2:1:1 ratio of 24H gives signals integrating to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\nLet's see if we can generate these integrals from the pair in option B:\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** provides one 12H signal.\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene** provides one 6H signal, one 3H signal, and another 3H signal.\n*   Can we combine these (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H) to get three signals of (12H, 6H, 6H)?\n    *   Yes, if the two 3H signals from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene are not resolved or happen to have the same chemical shift as the 6H signal from the same molecule (unlikely) or if the two 3H signals from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene merge into a single 6H signal.\n    *   If the two 3H signals from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene merge (or are degenerate), we would have signals of 12H (from 1,2,4,5-), 6H (from 1,2,3,5-), and another 6H (from the combined 3H+3H signals of 1,2,3,5-). This gives three signals with a 12:6:6 ratio, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\nThis is the only chemically plausible explanation that fits the data. The two methyl groups at positions 2 and 5 in 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene are unique but could have very similar chemical shifts, leading to them appearing as a single signal integrating to 6H.\n\nTherefore, the two compounds are 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\nFinal check:\n1.  **Aromatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-isomer (1 singlet, 2H) + 1,2,3,5-isomer (1 singlet, 2H) -> Mixture has two singlets, 1:1 ratio. Correct.\n2.  **Alkyl signals:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-isomer provides a 12H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-isomer provides a 6H singlet (C1+C3 methyls) and two 3H singlets (C2 and C5 methyls).\n    *   Assume the two 3H singlets from the 1,2,3,5-isomer overlap to give one 6H signal.\n    *   The total signals for the mixture are: 12H singlet, 6H singlet, and another 6H singlet.\n    *   The integration ratio is 12:6:6, which is 2:1:1. Correct.\n\nThis confirms that the compounds are 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

Since all three tetramethylbenzene isomers produce one aromatic 2H singlet each, any 1:1 mixture of two of them will produce two singlets with a 2H:2H or 1:1 ratio. This data alone is insufficient to distinguish the correct pair.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region:** This region is the key. The mixture shows three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n    *   In a 1:1 mixture, the total number of aliphatic protons is 12 (from compound X) + 12 (from compound Y) = 24H.\n    *   A 2:1:1 ratio on 24 protons corresponds to integrations of:\n        *   Signal 1 (2 parts): (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n        *   Signal 2 (1 part): (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n        *   Signal 3 (1 part): (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   We need to find a pair of compounds whose aliphatic signals combine to give three signals with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\nLet's test the possible pairs:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB:** This combination gives {6H, 6H} from Prehnitene and {6H, 3H, 3H} from Isodurene. This is five signals in total, which doesn't match.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,4-TMB:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB provides one aliphatic singlet integrating to **12H**.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB provides two aliphatic singlets, each integrating to **6H**.\n    *   Combining these gives exactly three signals with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**.

Let's break down the problem by analyzing the expected spectrum for each candidate compound and then see which pair matches the given data.\n\n**1. Analyze the Given Spectral Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** 1:1\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   This tells us that each compound in the mixture produces a single, sharp signal (a singlet) in the aromatic region.\n    *   The 1:1 ratio of these two signals means that the number of aromatic protons in compound A is equal to the number of aromatic protons in compound B (since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   These signals correspond to the methyl (or ethyl) groups attached to the aromatic rings.\n\n**2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nLet's check if the molecular formula C10H14 is correct for all options and predict their spectra.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Formula OK)\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C3 and C6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a **single singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups are all equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as a **single singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Formula OK)\n    *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry passes through C2 and C5.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a **single singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        *   The methyls at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyl at C2 is unique (3H).\n        *   The methyl at C5 is unique (3H).\n        *   This gives **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Formula OK)\n    *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are equivalent, but they are adjacent to each other. They will split each other, resulting in an AB quartet (or two doublets), **not a singlet**. This compound can be eliminated.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** C6H4(CH2CH3)2 = C10H14. (Formula OK)\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four protons on the ring are all equivalent. They will appear as a **single singlet (4H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The ethyl groups will show splitting: a quartet (4H) for the -CH2- groups and a triplet (6H) for the -CH3- groups. The problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets, so this compound can be eliminated.\n\n**3. Identify the Correct Pair of Compounds**\n\nBased on the analysis above, we can eliminate 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene. The only two remaining candidates that fit the aromatic signal description (producing a singlet) are **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\nLet's verify if a 1:1 mixture of these two compounds matches all the spectral data.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes a 2H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes a 2H singlet.\n    *   In a 1:1 mixture, this will result in **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This perfectly matches the data.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region:**\n    *   Let's consider the total number of aliphatic protons in the 1:1 mixture: 12H from the first compound + 12H from the second = 24H total.\n    *   The observed ratio is 2:1:1. The sum of the ratio parts is 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.\n    *   The actual integration for the three signals will be:\n        *   Signal 1: (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n        *   Signal 2: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n        *   Signal 3: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   Now let's see if our chosen pair can produce signals with these integrations:\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one singlet of **12H**. This matches our largest signal.\n        *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene provides three singlets of 6H, 3H, and 3H.\n        *   The 6H signal from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene can be our second signal.\n        *   For the third signal, we need an integration of 6H. This can be explained if the two 3H signals from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene accidentally have the same chemical shift and overlap, appearing as a single 6H peak. This is a common feature in NMR problems.\n    *   Therefore, the combined spectrum would show three aliphatic singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H, which gives the required **2:1:1 ratio**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that matches all the spectral data is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the two compounds in the mixture based on the provided 1H NMR data.\n\n### 1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. This indicates that the two compounds are in a 1:1 molar mixture, and each compound has only one type of aromatic proton (all aromatic protons on a given molecule are chemically equivalent). The 1:1 ratio of the signals confirms the 1:1 molar ratio of the compounds, as long as each compound has the same number of aromatic protons.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. These signals represent the combined methyl (or other alkyl) protons from both compounds in the mixture. All signals are singlets, meaning there is no splitting, which is characteristic of methyl groups not adjacent to any protons.\n\n### 2. Evaluate Each Compound Option\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 are all chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry passes through the C2 and C5 positions.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the one at C2, the one at C5, and the two equivalent ones at C1 and C3. This will produce **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 3H:3H:6H (or 1:1:2).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: the \"outer\" methyls (C1, C4) and the \"inner\" methyls (C2, C3). This will produce **two singlets**, each integrating to 6H, giving a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are all equivalent, producing **one singlet** for 4H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** This compound has ethyl groups, not just methyl groups. The spectrum would show a quartet (for the -CH2-) and a triplet (for the -CH3-), not just singlets. Therefore, this compound can be eliminated.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Mixture Options\n\nThe mixture must contain two compounds that each give a single peak in the aromatic region. All three tetramethylbenzene isomers fit this criterion. Since they each have 2 aromatic protons, a 1:1 mixture will correctly produce two aromatic singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n\nNow, we must find the combination whose alkyl signals add up to three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Combined alkyl signals: Two singlets (6H, 6H) from 1,2,3,4-TMB and three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H) from 1,2,3,5-TMB. This would result in up to five signals, which does not match the data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   Eliminated because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not give only singlets in the alkyl region.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Combined alkyl signals: One singlet (12H) from 1,2,4,5-TMB and three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H) from 1,2,3,5-TMB. This gives a total of four signals, which only matches the data if there is an accidental overlap of signals. To get a 2:1:1 ratio (which corresponds to 12H:6H:6H), the two 3H signals from 1,2,3,5-TMB would need to overlap, which is unlikely as they are in different chemical environments.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. A 1:1 mixture gives two 2H singlets, which is a 1:1 ratio. This matches the data.\n    *   **Alkyl signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H each).\n    *   **Combined alkyl signals:** The mixture will show three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   **Ratio:** The integration ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches the experimental data without needing to assume any accidental signal overlaps.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only option that perfectly accounts for all the features of the described 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Problem Statement:** First, we'll break down the information provided by the 1H NMR spectrum.\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n    *   **Mixture:** 1:1 ratio.\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. This implies the mixture contains two different compounds, and each compound contributes one aromatic singlet. Since the mixture is 1:1, the number of protons for each aromatic singlet must be the same.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. This is the combined signal from the aliphatic protons of both compounds in the mixture.\n\n2.  **Analyze Individual Candidate Compounds:** We will predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four options to see what signals they would produce on their own. We'll focus on the number of signals, their multiplicity (singlet, doublet, etc.), and their relative integration (number of protons).\n    *   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** Due to its high symmetry, it has one type of aromatic proton (2H) and one type of methyl group (12H). This gives 1 aromatic singlet (2H) and 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n    *   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** It has one plane of symmetry. This results in one type of aromatic proton (2H), and three different types of methyl groups (6H, 3H, 3H). This gives 1 aromatic singlet (2H) and 3 aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H, a 2:1:1 ratio).\n    *   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** It has one plane of symmetry. This results in one type of aromatic proton (2H) and two different types of methyl groups (6H, 6H). This gives 1 aromatic singlet (2H) and 2 aliphatic singlets (6H, 6H, a 1:1 ratio).\n    *   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has ethyl groups, which would produce quartets and triplets in the aliphatic region, not just singlets. Therefore, it can be eliminated from consideration.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Mixtures (Options A-D):** We will combine the predicted spectra for the pairs of compounds in each option (assuming a 1:1 mixture) and see which one matches the observed data.\n\n    *   **Aromatic Check:** A 1:1 mixture of any two of the tetramethylbenzene isomers will produce two 2H aromatic singlets, matching the observed 1:1 ratio. So, we must use the aliphatic region to distinguish them.\n    *   **Aliphatic Check:** We will sum the aliphatic signals for each pair and check if the result is three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n4.  **Code Implementation and Final Answer:** A Python script will be used to systematically perform the analysis described above and identify the correct option.\n\n```python\ndef solve_nmr_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes 1H NMR data for a mixture of two aromatic compounds to identify them.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the provided 1H NMR data for the 1:1 mixture.\")\n    print(\"  - Aromatic Region: 2 singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\")\n    print(\"  - Aliphatic Region: 3 singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # Step 2: Define the spectral characteristics of each candidate compound.\n    # The data is stored as: { \"aromatic_H\": count, \"aliphatic_integrations\": [list_of_H_counts] }\n    compounds = {\n        \"1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\": {\"aromatic_H\": 2, \"aliphatic_integrations\": [12]},\n        \"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\": {\"aromatic_H\": 2, \"aliphatic_integrations\": [6, 3, 3]},\n        \"1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\": {\"aromatic_H\": 2, \"aliphatic_integrations\": [6, 6]},\n        \"1,4-diethylbenzene\": {\"aromatic_H\": 4, \"aliphatic_integrations\": \"non-singlets\"}\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Predicted 1H NMR signals for individual compounds.\")\n    for name, data in compounds.items():\n        print(f\"  - {name}:\")\n        if isinstance(data[\"aliphatic_integrations\"], list):\n            print(f\"    - Aromatic: 1 singlet ({data['aromatic_H']}H)\")\n            print(f\"    - Aliphatic: {len(data['aliphatic_integrations'])} singlet(s) with integrations {data['aliphatic_integrations']}H\")\n        else:\n            print(\"    - Aliphatic signals are not all singlets, so this compound is excluded.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # Step 3: Define the options and evaluate them.\n    options = {\n        \"A\": (\"1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\"),\n        \"B\": (\"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,4-diethylbenzene\"),\n        \"C\": (\"1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\"),\n        \"D\": (\"1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\")\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Evaluating each option for a 1:1 mixture.\")\n    correct_option = None\n    for option, (name1, name2) in options.items():\n        print(f\"\\nTesting Option {option}: {name1} and {name2}\")\n        comp1 = compounds[name1]\n        comp2 = compounds[name2]\n\n        # Rule out any option with 1,4-diethylbenzene\n        if comp1[\"aliphatic_integrations\"] == \"non-singlets\" or comp2[\"aliphatic_integrations\"] == \"non-singlets\":\n            print(\"  - Result: FAILED.

The total number of carbons is 6 + 4 = 10. The total number of hydrogens is 2 + (4 * 3) = 14. The formula is C10H14. This applies to options 1, 2, and 3.\n*   **Diethylbenzene:** The formula is C6H4(C2H5)2. The total number of carbons is 6 + (2 * 2) = 10. The total number of hydrogens is 4 + (2 * 5) = 14. The formula is C10H14. This applies to option 4.\n*   **Conclusion:** All four compounds have the correct molecular formula.\n\n**Step 3: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nWe need to analyze the symmetry of each molecule to determine the number of unique proton environments.\n\n*   **1. 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical. There are two planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a **single singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent. They will appear as a **single singlet** with an integration of **12H**.\n    *   **Summary:** 2 signals total (one 2H aromatic singlet, one 12H alkyl singlet).\n\n*   **2. 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Less symmetrical. There is one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. They will appear as **two separate singlets**, each with an integration of **1H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct types of methyl groups:\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique (3H).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique (3H).\n        This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 5 signals total (two 1H aromatic singlets, three alkyl singlets with 2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **3. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Symmetrical. There is a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They are adjacent (ortho) to each other. While they would technically couple, in such a symmetrical environment (an AA' system), they often appear as a **single singlet** (or a narrow multiplet that looks like a singlet). The integration is **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two distinct types of methyl groups:\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        This results in **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which simplifies to **1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 3 signals total (one 2H aromatic singlet, two 6H alkyl singlets).\n\n*   **4. 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are all chemically equivalent. They will appear as a **single singlet** with an integration of **4H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The protons within the ethyl group are not.\n        *   The -CH2- protons will be a **quartet** (split by the -CH3) with an integration of **4H**.\n        *   The -CH3- protons will be a **triplet** (split by the -CH2-) with an integration of **6H**.\n    *   **Summary:** 3 signals total (one aromatic singlet, one alkyl quartet, one alkyl triplet). This is immediately ruled out because the problem states all signals in the aliphatic region are singlets.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Mixture Spectrum**\n\nWe need to find a 1:1 mixture of two compounds that produces the observed spectrum. We can eliminate any option containing 1,4-diethylbenzene (Option C) because it would produce a quartet and a triplet. We are left with options A, B, and D.\n\nLet's test the remaining combinations:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The combined spectrum would show three singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio. This does not match the \"two singlets in a 1:1 ratio\" observation.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,4-TMB:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. If these two singlets have different chemical shifts, the combined spectrum will show **two singlets**, each corresponding to 2H. In a 1:1 mixture, the integration ratio is **1:1**. **This matches the aromatic data.**\n    *   **Aliphatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets. The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This matches the aliphatic data.**\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The combined spectrum would show three singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio. This does not match the \"two singlets in a 1:1 ratio\" observation.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces the described 1H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:** The 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB and the 2H singlet from 1,2,3,4-TMB give two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic Region:** The 12H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB and the two 6H singlets from 1,2,3,4-TMB give three singlets in a 12:6:6 or 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Analyze the Provided NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's break down the information given from the 1H NMR spectrum of the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14. This corresponds to a degree of unsaturation of 4, consistent with a substituted benzene ring.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals, both are singlets, and their integration ratio is 1:1. This means there are two distinct types of aromatic protons in the mixture, and the total number of protons for each type is equal.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all are singlets, and their integration ratio is 2:1:1. This indicates three distinct types of alkyl protons (likely methyl groups since they are singlets), with their total proton counts in a 2:1:1 ratio. The chemical shift around 2.2 ppm is characteristic of methyl groups attached to a benzene ring.\n\n### **2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nWe need to determine the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds based on their molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has two planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single signal. Since there are no adjacent protons, this signal will be a **singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce a single signal, which will be a **singlet (12H)**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry passing through the C2-C5 axis.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The proton at C4 and the proton at C6 are in different chemical environments. They are not coupled to each other (meta-relationship). They will produce **two separate singlets (1H each)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        1.  The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  The methyl group at C2 is unique (3H).\n        3.  The methyl group at C5 is unique (3H).\n        This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 3 aliphatic singlets (ratio 2:1:1).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single signal. Since they are equivalent, they appear as a **singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        1.  The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        This results in **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which simplifies to **1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 aliphatic singlets (ratio 1:1).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four aromatic protons are equivalent, giving **one singlet (4H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The CH2 protons will be split by the CH3 protons into a **quartet (4H)**, and the CH3 protons will be split by the CH2 protons into a **triplet (6H)**.\n    *   **Summary:** The presence of a quartet and a triplet is inconsistent with the experimental data, which only shows singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**, which also eliminates option D.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we combine the spectra of the remaining candidates in a 1:1 ratio to see which pair matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The combined spectrum would show three singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio. This does not match the observed two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB also gives one 2H singlet. Assuming they have slightly different chemical shifts, the combined spectrum will show **two singlets**. Since they both represent 2H and the mixture is 1:1, their integration ratio will be **1:1**. **This matches the experimental data.**\n    *   **Aliphatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H each). The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** (assuming they all have different chemical shifts). The integration ratio will be 12H:6H:6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This also matches the experimental data.**\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The combined spectrum would show three singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio. This does not match the observed two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces the described 1H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the 1H NMR data provided.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** 1:1.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. This means there are two types of aromatic protons in the mixture, and they are present in equal amounts. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this implies that each compound contributes an equal number of protons to these two signals.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. This indicates three distinct types of methyl groups in the mixture.\n\n### Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR spectra for each individual compound.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Low.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are not equivalent. They are meta to each other, so coupling is negligible, resulting in **two singlets** (1H each).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3, the one at C2, and the one at C5. This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Moderate.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. Because they are adjacent (ortho), they couple, but due to symmetry (an AA' system), they often appear as a single, sometimes broadened, signal. We will approximate this as **one singlet** (2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 and the pair at C2/C3. This results in **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, or 1:1.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four protons on the ring are equivalent, producing **one singlet** (4H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. Each gives a quartet (-CH2-) and a triplet (-CH3). This results in **one quartet** (4H) and **one triplet** (6H), not singlets.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the options based on a 1:1 mixture.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Would show three singlets (one 2H signal from the first compound and two 1H signals from the second), with a 2:1:1 ratio. This does not match the observed two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** Would show four singlets (one from the first compound, three from the second). This does not match the observed three singlets.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Would show three singlets (two 1H signals from the first compound, one 4H signal from the second). This does not match.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** Would show three singlets, a quartet, and a triplet. This does not match.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Would show three singlets (one 2H signal from the first compound, two 1H signals from the second). This does not match.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** Would show up to five singlets (two from the first, three from the second). This does not match.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** The first compound gives one 2H singlet. The second compound gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets**, each integrating to 2H, giving the observed **1:1 ratio**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** The first compound gives one singlet (12H). The second compound gives two singlets (6H each). In a 1:1 mixture, this results in a total of **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is also a perfect match.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene in a 1:1 mixture is the only option that perfectly explains the observed 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the 1H NMR data to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n### Analysis of the Provided 1H NMR Spectrum Data\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** 1:1\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio, the two aromatic signals must come from protons that are equal in number. For example, two different 2H signals, or two different 1H signals that happen to have a 1:1 ratio due to the mixture.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n### Evaluating Each Compound's Expected 1H NMR Spectrum\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons to couple with, so they appear as a single **singlet** representing 2 hydrogens (2H).\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as a single **singlet** representing 12 hydrogens (12H).\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a single plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** There are two non-equivalent aromatic protons at positions 4 and 6. Neither has an adjacent proton, so they appear as two distinct **singlets**, each representing 1 hydrogen (1H).\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique (3H).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique (3H).\n        *   This results in three **singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are chemically equivalent but are adjacent to each other. This ortho-coupling means they will split each other, appearing as a pair of doublets (an AB system), not singlets. This compound can be immediately ruled out as it does not produce singlets in the aromatic region.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** It would show two singlets for the methyl groups (one for C1/C4 and one for C2/C3).\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are chemically equivalent and appear as a single **singlet** (4H).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The signals for the ethyl groups would be a quartet for the CH2 and a triplet for the CH3, not singlets. This compound can also be ruled out.\n\n### Analyzing the Mixture Options\n\nBased on the individual spectra, only 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene produce only singlets in both the aromatic and aliphatic regions (ignoring the splitting in prehnitene and diethylbenzene). Let's examine the mixture described in option B.\n\n**Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene in a 1:1 mixture.**\n\n*   **Aromatic Signals:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one singlet (2H).\n    *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene provides two singlets (1H each).\n    *   The problem states there are only **two singlets in a 1:1 ratio**. This can happen if one of the 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene has the same chemical shift as the 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene. This would result in one signal integrating to 3H (2H+1H) and the other integrating to 1H, giving a 3:1 ratio. This contradicts the given 1:1 ratio.\n    *   Let's re-evaluate. What if the two aromatic signals observed are the 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and one of the aromatic protons from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, and the other proton from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene is overlapping with one of the methyl signals? This is highly unlikely.\n    *   Let's reconsider the aromatic signals from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. They are two 1H singlets. And the signal from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene is one 2H singlet. For the mixture to show two aromatic signals in a 1:1 ratio, it implies that the total number of protons for each signal is the same. This would happen if the two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene are the signals observed, and the 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene is coincidentally overlapping with one of them. This would lead to a 3:1 ratio.\n    *   There must be a misunderstanding of the problem or a simplification. Let's re-examine the aliphatic region, which is often more definitive.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Signals:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one singlet (12H).\n    *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene provides three singlets (in a 6H:3H:3H ratio).\n    *   **Combined:** The spectrum is described as having three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. This perfectly matches the signals from **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene alone**.\n    *   If the mixture contains 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, it should contribute a large 12H singlet. This would drastically alter the aliphatic region unless its signal overlaps perfectly with one of the signals from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n        *   Let's assume the 12H singlet from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene overlaps with the 6H singlet from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. The total integration would be (12H+6H) : 3H : 3H, which is an 18:3:3 or 6:1:1 ratio. This does not match.\n        *   Let's assume the 12H singlet from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene overlaps with one of the 3H singlets from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. The total integration would be 6H : (12H+3H) : 3H, which is a 6:15:3 or 2:5:1 ratio. This does not match.\n\nThere seems to be a contradiction in the problem statement as written. Let's reconsider the aromatic region. \"two signals (two singlets) at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio\".\n\nLet's assume there is a typo in the aliphatic ratio and re-evaluate the aromatic signals.\n*   **Mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic signals: 1 singlet (2H) from durene, 2 singlets (1H each) from isodurene.\n    *   If the 2H singlet from durene has a unique chemical shift, and the two 1H singlets from isodurene are also resolved, we would see three signals with a 2:1:1 ratio.\n    *   If the 2H singlet from durene overlaps with one of the 1H singlets from isodurene, we would see two signals with a 3:1 ratio.\n    *   If the two 1H singlets from isodurene have the same chemical shift (unlikely but possible), and this is different from the durene signal, we would see two signals with a 2H:2H or 1:1 ratio. Let's check if this is plausible. The two aromatic protons in isodurene are in slightly different environments, so their signals should be distinct.\n\nLet's reconsider the aliphatic region. \"three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio\". This is the exact pattern for 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene's methyl groups (6H:3H:3H). Where does the signal for 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene's methyl groups (12H) go? For the overall ratio to be 2:1:1, the 12H signal must be hidden or overlapping in a very specific way.\n\nLet's reconsider the question and options. There might be a simpler interpretation.\n\n*   **Aromatic:** Two singlets, 1:1 ratio.\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene has one 2H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene has two 1H singlets.\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene has one 2H signal (not a singlet).\n    *   If we mix **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**, we get a 2H singlet and a 2H non-singlet. This doesn't match.\n    *   If we mix **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**, we have a 2H singlet and two 1H singlets. This is three signals.\n    *   What if the question implies that the two compounds *together* create this pattern?\n\nLet's assume the two compounds are **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**.\n*   **Aromatic Protons:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB: 1 singlet (2H) at ~6.89 ppm.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB: 2 singlets (1H each).\n    *   The problem states two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. This could mean the 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB and the two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB accidentally integrate to a 1:1 ratio. This is only possible if the two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB are coincidentally equivalent, giving a 2H singlet. Then we would have two 2H singlets, which is a 1:1 ratio. This is the most plausible explanation for the aromatic region.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Protons:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB: 1 singlet (12H) at ~2.18 ppm.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB: 3 singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   The problem states three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. This is the exact pattern for the methyl groups of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. This implies that the large 12H singlet from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene must be overlapping with one of the signals from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n    *   Let's assume the 12H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB overlaps with the 6H singlet from 1,2,3,5-TMB. This would give three signals with integrals of (12+6)H : 3H : 3H, which is an 18:3:3 or 6:1:1 ratio. This does not match the 2:1:1 ratio given.\n\nThere is a clear contradiction in the problem statement. However, in multiple-choice questions of this nature, one must often find the \"best fit\" even if the data is imperfectly described.\n\nLet's re-evaluate from the start, assuming there is a correct answer among the options.\n*   Options A and C are ruled out because 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene does not give an aromatic singlet.\n*   Option D is ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene gives a quartet and a triplet, not singlets, for its alkyl protons.\n\nThis leaves only **Option B** as a possibility. Let's try to reconcile the data with this option.\n*   **Compounds:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n*   **Aliphatic Signals:** The problem states three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. This is the signature of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene's methyl groups (6H:3H:3H). For this to be the observed ratio in a 1:1 mixture, the 12H singlet from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene must be accounted for. The only way the 2:1:1 ratio is preserved is if the 12H signal from 1,2,4,5-TMB overlaps with the 6H signal from 1,2,3,5-TMB, and the problem statement has a typo in the ratio. For instance, if the ratio was 6:1:1, it would fit. Given the provided 2:1:1 ratio, there is a strong contradiction.\n*   **Aromatic Signals:** The problem states two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB gives a 2H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets.\n    *   For these to result in two singlets with a 1:1 ratio, the most likely scenario (within the constraints of a flawed question) is that the two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB are coincidentally degenerate (have the same chemical shift), creating a single 2H singlet. This, combined with the 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB, would give two 2H singlets, resulting in a 1:1 integration ratio.\n\n**Conclusion based on best fit:**\nDespite the contradictions in the data (particularly the aliphatic ratio), Option B is the only one that contains compounds that could plausibly create the described signals (all singlets). The other options include compounds that fundamentally do not match the signal splitting (non-singlets). Therefore, assuming there are errors in the problem's description of the ratios, Option B is the only chemically sound choice.\n\nFinal check:\n- Aromatic: Two 2H singlets (1:1 ratio) is plausible if the two 1H protons in 1,2,3,5-TMB are accidentally equivalent in the NMR.\n- Aliphatic: Three singlets (2:1:1 ratio). This is the pattern for 1,2,3,5-TMB. The 12H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB is problematic. However, if we must choose the best option, B is the only one that doesn't violate fundamental splitting rules.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### 1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** 1:1\n*   **Aromatic Region:** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. Since the mixture is 1:1, the total number of aromatic protons from each compound must be equal. Let's say each compound contributes 'x' protons to the aromatic region. The total integration would be 2x. The two signals having a 1:1 ratio means each signal corresponds to 'x' protons.\n*   **Alkyl Region:** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n### 2. Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum of Each Option\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each individual compound.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Low.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are not equivalent. This will produce **two separate singlets**, each for 1H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the one at C5, the one at C2, and the two equivalent ones at C1 and C3. This will produce **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 3H:3H:6H, which simplifies to **1:1:2**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Moderate.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are adjacent (ortho-coupling). They will split each other, producing **two doublets**, not singlets.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: C1/C4 and C2/C3. This will produce **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which simplifies to **1:1**.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four protons are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** for 4H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. This will produce a **quartet** (4H, from the two -CH2- groups) and a **triplet** (6H, from the two -CH3 groups).\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Options Based on the Mixture's Spectrum\n\nNow, let's analyze the combined spectrum for a 1:1 mixture of each pair.\n\n**A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   **Alkyl Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet of 12H.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two singlets, each of 6H.\n    *   The combined spectrum would show **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 12H:6H:6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches the experimental data for the alkyl region.\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet (2H).\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two doublets (1H each).\n    *   The problem states there are \"two singlets\" in a 1:1 ratio. This appears to be a contradiction. However, the alkyl region data is a perfect and unambiguous match. It is highly likely that the description of the aromatic region is slightly inaccurate in the problem statement. For instance, the two doublets from 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene might be considered as one \"signal\" (a multiplet) integrating to 2H. This would result in two signals (one singlet, one multiplet) with a 2H:2H or 1:1 integration ratio. Given the perfect fit of the alkyl data, this is the most plausible option.\n\n**B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n*   **Alkyl Region:** This mixture would show three singlets (from 1,2,3,5-TMB) plus a quartet and a triplet (from 1,4-diethylbenzene). This does not match the observation of only three singlets.\n\n**C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   **Alkyl Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet (12H).\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   The combined spectrum would have four singlets with a ratio of 12:6:3:3 (or 4:2:1:1). This does not match the observed 2:1:1 ratio unless there is an accidental overlap of the two 3H signals, which is an extra assumption.\n*   **Aromatic Region:** This mixture would show three singlets (one 2H and two 1H signals), which contradicts the \"two signals\" observation.\n\n**D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   **Alkyl Region:** This mixture would produce at least five singlets (two from 1,2,3,4-TMB and three from 1,2,3,5-TMB), which is inconsistent with the data.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe data for the alkyl region (three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio) is uniquely and perfectly explained by the combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. Despite the conflicting description of the aromatic region signals as \"singlets,\" the strength of the evidence from the alkyl region makes this the only logical choice.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the information provided in the question.**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** The mixture contains two compounds, both with the formula C10H14.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** The two compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both are singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all are singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\n**Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four candidate compounds.**\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single signal, a singlet, integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent. They will produce a single signal, a singlet, integrating to 12H.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has a single plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. They will produce two distinct signals. Since neither has an adjacent proton, they will both be singlets, each integrating to 1H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        1.  The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent by symmetry (a singlet for 6H).\n        2.  The methyl group at C2 is unique (a singlet for 3H).\n        3.  The methyl group at C5 is unique (a singlet for 3H).\n    *   This gives three aliphatic singlets with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n    *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 3 aliphatic singlets (in a 2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent but are adjacent to each other. They will couple and split each other's signals, resulting in a pair of doublets (an AX or AB system), not singlets.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** Two sets of equivalent methyl groups (C1/C4 and C2/C3), giving two singlets, each for 6H.\n    *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic doublets, 2 aliphatic singlets.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are all equivalent, giving one singlet for 4H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The protons of the ethyl groups will show splitting. The CH2 protons will be a quartet (split by the CH3) and the CH3 protons will be a triplet (split by the CH2).\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet, 1 aliphatic quartet, 1 aliphatic triplet.\n\n**Step 3: Use the process of elimination to find the correct pair of compounds.**\n\nThe problem states that all observed signals are **singlets**. This is a crucial piece of information.\n\n*   **Eliminate options with 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** Prehnitene produces aromatic **doublets**, not singlets. This rules out options A and D.\n    *   A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene -> **Incorrect**.\n    *   D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene -> **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **Eliminate the option with 1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound produces an aliphatic **quartet** and **triplet**. The problem specifies that all aliphatic signals are singlets. This rules out option C.\n    *   C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene -> **Incorrect**.\n\n**Step 4: Confirm the remaining option.**\n\nBy elimination, the only possible answer is **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\nLet's verify how this mixture could produce the observed spectrum:\n*   **Aromatic Region:** The mixture contains Durene (one 2H singlet) and Isodurene (two 1H singlets). The problem states there are two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. This can happen if the two 1H singlets of Isodurene are not resolved by the spectrometer and appear as a single 2H singlet. The spectrum would then show the 2H singlet from Durene and the unresolved 2H singlet from Isodurene, resulting in two signals with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic Region:** The mixture contains Durene (one 12H singlet) and Isodurene (three singlets of 6H, 3H, and 3H). The problem states there are three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. The aliphatic signals of Isodurene alone perfectly match this description (6H:3H:3H = 2:1:1). The question is likely constructed such that the complex pattern of Isodurene is the identifying feature, and the signal from Durene is assumed to overlap with one of the other signals or the question is simplified. However, the elimination of all other options is definitive.\n\nBased on the strict criteria of signal splitting (singlets vs. other multiplets), option B is the only chemically sound choice.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe objective is to identify which pair of compounds from the given options, when mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio, produces the described 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Given NMR Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14. All options are isomers with this formula.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** 1:1 molar ratio. This is crucial for comparing the integration of signals from the two different compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. This means that in the 1:1 mixture, the total number of protons contributing to the first singlet is equal to the total number of protons contributing to the second singlet.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. This tells us about the relative number of methyl protons in different chemical environments.\n\n### **3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nWe need to determine the number of signals, their multiplicity (singlet, doublet, etc.), and the integration for both the aromatic and aliphatic protons of each potential compound. This is done by analyzing the molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric. It has two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single signal. Since there are no adjacent protons, it will be a **singlet**. Integration: **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce a single signal, a **singlet**.

Evaluate Each Option Against the Mixture's Spectrum**\n\nNow, let's combine the predicted spectra for each pair in a 1:1 ratio and see which one matches the experimental data.\n\n**A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n*   **Aromatic Region:** Durene gives one 2H singlet. Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet. The mixture will show **two singlets**. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio and each signal represents 2 protons, the integration ratio will be 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. **This matches the data.**\n*   **Aliphatic Region:** Durene gives one 12H singlet. Prehnitene gives two 6H singlets. The mixture will show **three singlets** (assuming they have different chemical shifts). The integration ratio will be 12H:6H:6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This matches the data.**\n*   **Conclusion:** This option is a perfect match.\n\n**B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n*   **Aromatic Region:** Durene gives one 2H singlet. Isodurene gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show three signals (one 2H, two 1H), not two.

The problem states there are only three singlets in the aliphatic region. This does not match.\n\n### **5. Final Answer**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that correctly predicts the observed 1H NMR spectrum for the 1:1 mixture is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the predicted 1H NMR spectra for the candidate molecules and then combining them to match the experimental data for the mixture.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Given NMR Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds. All four options are isomers with this formula.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** 1:1. This is crucial because it means the integration values from each compound contribute equally to the total spectrum.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets in a 1:1 integration ratio. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this implies that each compound must contribute one aromatic singlet, and these singlets must represent an equal number of protons.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 integration ratio. These signals are the sum of all the methyl protons from both compounds in the mixture.\n\n**Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nWe determine the number of unique proton environments in each molecule based on its symmetry.\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-CH3):** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n    *   *Spectrum Summary:* 2 signals total.\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-CH3):** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: C1/C3 are equivalent (6H), C2 is unique (3H), and C5 is unique (3H). This gives **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which is **2:1:1**.\n    *   *Spectrum Summary:* 4 signals total.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-CH3):** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: C1/C4 are equivalent (6H) and C2/C3 are equivalent (6H). This gives **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which is **1:1**.\n    *   *Spectrum Summary:* 3 signals total.\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This compound has ethyl groups. The protons on the CH2 group will be split by the protons on the CH3 group, resulting in a quartet and a triplet in the aliphatic region. The problem states that all aliphatic signals are singlets. Therefore, this compound can be immediately ruled out, eliminating any option containing it.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Proposed Mixtures**\n\nWe will now combine the predicted spectra for the pairs in the options.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. The mixture will show **two singlets** in a **1:1 ratio**. This matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H and 6H). The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with relative integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also matches the data.\n    *   **This option is a perfect match.**\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Both give a 2H singlet, so the mixture has two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. This part is correct.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combined spectrum would have a total of **four aliphatic singlets**. This contradicts the data, which states there are only three.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   This option is ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not give only singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Both give a 2H singlet, so the mixture has two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. This part is correct.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H, 6H). 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combined spectrum would have at least four signals (assuming one of the 6H signals overlaps). This does not result in three signals with a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces the described NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nTo solve this problem, we need to predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the candidate molecules and then see which 1:1 mixture matches the experimental data.\n\n**Experimental Data for the 1:1 Mixture:**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum of Each Individual Compound**\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetric, with two planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent.

Within each ethyl group, the -CH2- (methylene) protons and -CH3 (methyl) protons are different and will split each other.\n    *   **Expected Spectrum:** One singlet in the aromatic region (4H), one quartet in the aliphatic region (4H from the two -CH2- groups), and one triplet in the aliphatic region (6H from the two -CH3- groups).\n\n### Analysis of the 1:1 Mixture\n\nThe experimental data for the 1:1 mixture shows:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** This mixture would show three aromatic singlets (or fewer if there's overlap, but the ratios would be complex) and would also contain a quartet and a triplet from the diethylbenzene, which contradicts the data.\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-isomer gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-isomer gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in two singlets with a 2H:2H or 1:1 integration ratio. This matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** 1,2,4,5-isomer gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4-isomer gives two 6H singlets. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in three singlets with an integration ratio of 12H:6H:6H, which simplifies to 2:1:1. This also matches the data.\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** This mixture would produce three aromatic singlets (one 2H and two 1H) and five aliphatic singlets, which contradicts the data.\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** This mixture would produce three aromatic singlets (one 2H and two 1H) and four aliphatic singlets, which contradicts the data.\n\nThe only combination that perfectly explains the observed NMR data is the mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Analyze the given information from the 1H NMR spectrum:**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** 1:1.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n**2. Analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each of the options:**\n\nLet's predict the number of signals, their multiplicity, and their relative integrations for each compound.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to 12H.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry passes through the C2 and C5 positions.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C4 and C6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        1.  The two methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  The methyl group at C2 is unique (3H).\n        3.  The methyl group at C5 is unique (3H).\n        This will result in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 3 aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        1.  The two methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  The two methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        This will result in **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:6, which simplifies to 1:1.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 aliphatic singlets (6H, 6H).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H4(C2H5)2 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   The problem states that all signals in the aliphatic region are singlets. 1,4-diethylbenzene has ethyl groups, which will show splitting (a quartet for the -CH2- and a triplet for the -CH3). Therefore, this compound can be eliminated immediately. This rules out option D.\n\n**3. Evaluate the remaining options based on the mixture's spectrum:**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture of two compounds that produces the observed spectrum.\n\n*   **Aromatic Signals:** The mixture shows two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. Since all three remaining candidate compounds (Durene, Isodurene, Prehnitene) each have one aromatic singlet corresponding to 2H, any 1:1 mixture of two of them will produce two aromatic singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. This condition is met by options A, B, and C.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Signals:** The mixture shows three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. In a 1:1 mixture, the total number of aliphatic protons is 12 (from the first compound) + 12 (from the second compound) = 24H. The 2:1:1 ratio corresponds to integrations of:\n    *   (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n    *   (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    So, we need a combination that gives three signals integrating to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\nLet's test the combinations:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Durene gives one singlet (12H).\n    *   Isodurene gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   Combined, this would give four signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H), unless some signals overlap. This does not match the observed three signals with a 2:1:1 ratio without assuming accidental signal overlap.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Prehnitene gives two singlets (6H, 6H).\n    *   Isodurene gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   Combined, this would give up to five signals. To get the desired pattern, multiple accidental overlaps would be required, which is unlikely.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Durene gives **one singlet (12H)**.\n    *   Prehnitene gives **two singlets (6H and 6H)**.\n    *   When combined in a 1:1 mixture, the aliphatic spectrum will show exactly **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n    *   The ratio of these integrations is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   This combination perfectly matches the description of the aliphatic region without requiring any assumptions of accidental signal overlap.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only option that directly accounts for all the features of the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nTo solve this problem, we must determine the expected 1H NMR spectra for each of the potential compounds and then see which 1:1 mixture matches the provided spectral data.\n\n### Analysis of Individual Compounds\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** Due to its high symmetry, all four methyl groups are equivalent, and the two aromatic protons are equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** One singlet (2H).\n    *   **Alkyl protons:** One singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry. The two aromatic protons are equivalent, as are the methyl groups at positions 1 and 4, and the methyl groups at positions 2 and 3.\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** One singlet (2H).\n    *   **Alkyl protons:** Two singlets (6H each), creating a 1:1 ratio between them.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has no symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** Two distinct protons, resulting in two singlets (1H each).\n    *   **Alkyl protons:** In theory, four distinct methyl groups. However, accidental equivalence is common. Spectra show three signals for the methyl groups, with integrals in a 2:1:1 ratio (representing 6H, 3H, and 3H).\n\n*   **1,4-Diethylbenzene:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** One singlet (4H).\n    *   **Alkyl protons:** The ethyl groups give a quartet (4H) and a triplet (6H). They are not singlets.\n\n### Evaluation of the Mixture in Each Option\n\nThe experimental data for the 1:1 mixture shows:\n*   **Aromatic Region:** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Alkyl Region:** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nLet's assess the options:\n\n**A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n*   This mixture would show three aromatic signals and would have a quartet and a triplet in the alkyl region, which contradicts the given data.\n\n**B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n*   This mixture would produce three aromatic signals (one 2H singlet from 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene). This is inconsistent with the observation of only two aromatic signals.\n\n**C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n*   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene also gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, if these singlets have different chemical shifts, they will appear as two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. This matches the experimental data.\n*   **Alkyl Signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene gives two 6H singlets. In a 1:1 mixture, this combination results in three singlets with integrals corresponding to 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio of these integrals is 12:6:6, which simplifies to 2:1:1. This perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n**D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n*   This mixture would result in three aromatic signals (one 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene), which contradicts the data.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only pair that fits the described 1H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **Goal:** Identify two compounds from a list of four that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produce a specific 1H NMR spectrum.\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for all candidate compounds.\n    *   **Mixture:** 1:1 molar ratio. This means the total number of protons contributed by each compound to the spectrum is equal.\n    *   **NMR Data (Aromatic Region):** Two singlets around 6.7 ppm with a 1:1 integral ratio.\n    *   **NMR Data (Aliphatic Region):** Three singlets around 2.2 ppm with a 2:1:1 integral ratio.\n\n2.  **Analyze Each Candidate Compound's Predicted 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The key is to determine the number of unique proton environments (which gives the number of signals) and the number of protons in each environment (which gives the integration). Symmetry is crucial here.\n\n    *   **Candidate 1: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n        *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric. Two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n        *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at C3 and C6 are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** for 2 protons (2H).\n        *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** for 12 protons (12H).\n        *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n    *   **Candidate 2: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n        *   **Symmetry:** No plane of symmetry that makes protons or methyl groups equivalent in the way needed.\n        *   **Aromatic Protons:** The proton at C4 (between two methyl groups) is different from the proton at C6 (between a methyl group and a hydrogen on the adjacent carbon, C1). So, **two aromatic singlets**, each for 1 proton (1H).\n        *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are in unique chemical environments. So, **four aliphatic singlets**, each for 3 protons (3H).\n        *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 4 aliphatic singlets (3H each).\n\n    *   **Candidate 3: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n        *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n        *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at C5 and C6 are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** for 2 protons (2H).\n        *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent but different from the first pair. This gives **two aliphatic singlets**, each for 6 protons (6H).\n        *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 aliphatic singlets (6H each).\n\n    *   **Candidate 4: 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n        *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric.\n        *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four ring protons are equivalent, giving **one singlet** (4H).\n        *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The ethyl groups show spin-spin splitting. The CH2 protons will be a quartet and the CH3 protons will be a triplet.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene is not a possible component**. This immediately eliminates option C.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Mixture Options based on the combined spectra:**\n\n    *   **Observed Aromatic Spectrum:** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. In a 1:1 mixture, this means each compound must contribute one singlet, and the number of protons for each singlet must be equal.\n    *   **Observed Aliphatic Spectrum:** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. The total number of aliphatic protons is 12 (from compound 1) + 12 (from compound 2) = 24. A 2:1:1 ratio of 24 protons means the signals correspond to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n    *   **Option A: 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,4-TMB**\n        *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. Combined, this is **two singlets**. Since both are 2H, the ratio is 1:1. **This matches.**\n        *   **Aliphatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets. Combined, this is **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to 2:1:1. **This matches.**\n        *   **Conclusion:** This option is a perfect fit.\n\n    *   **Option B: 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB**\n        *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two singlets. The total is three aromatic singlets. **This does not match.**\n\n    *   **Option D: 1,2,3,4-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB**\n        *   **Aromatic:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two singlets.

This corresponds to a degree of unsaturation of 4, consistent with a substituted benzene ring.\n2.  **Mixture Ratio:** The two compounds are present in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n3.  **1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals, both are singlets, and their integration ratio is 1:1.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all are singlets, and their integration ratio is 2:1:1.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Candidate Compounds\nWe need to predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds. All of them have the formula C10H14.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has two planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 are all chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n    *   **Summary (Durene):** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry passing through the methyl groups at C2 and C5. This plane makes C1 and C3 equivalent, and C4 and C6 equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        1.  The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  The methyl group at C2 is unique (3H).\n        3.  The methyl group at C5 is unique (3H).\n        This will result in **three singlets** in the aliphatic region with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Summary (Isodurene):** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 3 aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds. This makes C1 equivalent to C4, C2 equivalent to C3, and C5 equivalent to C6.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. Since equivalent protons do not split each other, they will appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        1.  The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H).\n        2.  The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        This will result in **two singlets** in the aliphatic region with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which simplifies to **1:1**.\n    *   **Summary (Prehnitene):** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 aliphatic singlets (6H, 6H).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are all chemically equivalent and will appear as a **singlet** integrating to **4H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. Within each ethyl group, the CH2 protons are split by the CH3 protons, and vice-versa. This will result in a **quartet** (4H total) and a **triplet** (6H total).\n    *   **Summary (1,4-diethylbenzene):** 1 aromatic singlet (4H), 1 aliphatic quartet (4H), 1 aliphatic triplet (6H).\n    *   **Careful Point:** The problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated** from the possibilities.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Mixture Based on the Options\n\nNow we combine the predicted spectra for the compounds in each option, remembering the mixture is 1:1.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not have only singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Both compounds give one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this would result in two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. This matches.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** Prehnitene gives two 6H singlets. Isodurene gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combined spectrum would have up to five signals (or fewer if there is accidental overlap). This does not match the observation of three signals with a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Both Durene (1,2,4,5-) and Prehnitene (1,2,3,4-) give one 2H singlet each. In a 1:1 mixture, this will produce **two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio**. This perfectly matches the experimental data.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** Durene gives one singlet for 12H. Prehnitene gives two singlets, each for 6H. The combined spectrum will therefore show **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio of these integrations is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Both compounds give one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this would result in two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. This matches.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** Durene gives one 12H singlet. Isodurene gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combined spectrum would have four signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H), unless the two 3H signals from Isodurene happen to have the same chemical shift. This is chemically unlikely and doesn't provide as direct a fit as option C.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe 1:1 mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)** is the only option that perfectly accounts for all the features of the described 1H NMR spectrum without requiring any assumptions about accidental signal overlap.\n\n*   **Aromatic:** Durene (1s, 2H) + Prehnitene (1s, 2H) -> 2 singlets, 1:1 ratio. **(Correct)**\n*   **Aliphatic:** Durene (1s, 12H) + Prehnitene (2s, 6H + 6H) -> 3 singlets, 12H:6H:6H or 2:1:1 ratio. **(Correct)**\n\nThus, the two compounds are 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nTo determine the two compounds in the mixture, we must analyze the provided 1H NMR data and compare it with the expected spectra for each potential compound.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Experimental NMR Data**\n\n*   **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar ratio of two compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals. Both are singlets, and their integration ratio is 1:1.\n    *   Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this means each compound contributes one aromatic singlet.\n    *   The 1:1 integration ratio signifies that the number of protons creating the singlet from the first compound is equal to the number of protons creating the singlet from the second compound.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals. All are singlets, and their integration ratio is 2:1:1.\n    *   The fact that all alkyl signals are singlets immediately suggests that the compounds are tetramethylbenzenes, as ethyl groups would produce a characteristic quartet and triplet. This allows us to eliminate **1,4-diethylbenzene** and, consequently, **option D**.\n    *   In a 1:1 mixture, the total number of alkyl protons is 12 (from compound 1) + 12 (from compound 2) = 24 protons.\n    *   The 2:1:1 ratio represents a total of 4 parts. The integration for each signal is:\n        *   Signal 1: (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n        *   Signal 2: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n        *   Signal 3: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   Therefore, the mixture's spectrum must show three alkyl singlets with integrations corresponding to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n### **2. Predicted Spectra for the Candidate Compounds**\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR signals for the remaining tetramethylbenzene isomers:\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   Due to its high symmetry, it has two types of protons.\n    *   **Aromatic:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet integrating to 2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl:** The four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one singlet integrating to 12H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet integrating to 2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: (C1-Me, C4-Me) and (C2-Me, C3-Me). This results in **two singlets, each integrating to 6H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule is less symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different environments. They would produce **two singlets, each integrating to 1H**.\n    *   **Alkyl:** All four methyl groups are in unique environments. This would produce **four singlets, each integrating to 3H**.\n\n### **3. Evaluating the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we can test which 1:1 mixture matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **Mixture A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB also contributes one 2H singlet. The mixture will show **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 2H:2H, which simplifies to **1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two singlets (6H each). The mixture will show a total of **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is also a perfect match.\n\nThis combination perfectly explains all features of the observed spectrum. We can quickly check the other options to be certain.\n\n*   **Mixture B:** Would have 3 aromatic signals (one 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB and two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB). This does not match the observed 2 signals.\n*   **Mixture C:** Would also have 3 aromatic signals (one 2H singlet from 1,2,3,4-TMB and two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB). This does not match.\n\nTherefore, the mixture must contain 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nThe provided 1H NMR data for a 1:1 mixture of two C10H14 aromatic compounds indicates the presence of two singlets in the aromatic region (~6.7 ppm) with a 1:1 ratio, and three singlets in the alkyl region (~2.2 ppm) with a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nLet's analyze the expected 1H NMR signals for each potential compound:\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** Due to its high symmetry, all four methyl groups are equivalent, and the two aromatic protons are equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** One singlet (for 2H).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** One singlet (for 12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry. The methyl groups at positions 1 and 4 are equivalent, and the methyl groups at positions 2 and 3 are equivalent. The two aromatic protons at positions 5 and 6 are also equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** One singlet (for 2H).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** Two singlets (one for 6H, one for 6H, a 1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has lower symmetry. It shows two distinct aromatic protons and three sets of non-equivalent methyl groups.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** Two singlets (1H each).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** Three singlets (in a 6H:3H:3H ratio).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has four equivalent aromatic protons. The ethyl groups would produce a quartet and a triplet, not singlets, in the alkyl region. Therefore, it can be ruled out.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the mixture options:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** This mixture would result in three aromatic signals (one from the first compound and two from the second), which contradicts the data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one 2H singlet, and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in two singlets of equal integration (1:1 ratio), which matches the experimental data.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one singlet (corresponding to 12H). 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene gives two singlets (each corresponding to 6H). The combination would show three singlets with an integration ratio of 12H:6H:6H, which simplifies to 2:1:1. This perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** This mixture would produce three aromatic signals, which is inconsistent with the observed spectrum.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** This combination is incorrect due to the number of aromatic signals and the signal splitting (quartet/triplet) from 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\nBased on the analysis, the mixture must contain 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nTo solve this problem, a detailed analysis of the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each potential compound is necessary. The spectrum of the 1:1 mixture shows two singlets in the aromatic region (~6.7 ppm) with a 1:1 ratio, and three singlets in the aliphatic region (~2.2 ppm) with a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n### **Analysis of Individual Compounds**\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a high degree of symmetry with two perpendicular planes.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. This results in a single signal, a singlet, for 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry. This results in a single signal, a singlet, for 12H.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry passing through the methyl groups at C2 and C5.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent due to this symmetry. This gives one singlet for 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups are in three different chemical environments:\n        *   The methyls at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyl at C2 is unique (3H).\n        *   The methyl at C5 is unique (3H).\n        This results in three aliphatic singlets with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 3 aliphatic singlets (2:1:1 ratio).\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are equivalent and will produce a single singlet for 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups are in two different chemical environments:\n        *   The methyls at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyls at C2 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        This results in two aliphatic singlets with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, or 1:1.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 aliphatic singlets (1:1 ratio).\n\n4.  **1,4-Diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a high degree of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four aromatic protons are equivalent, giving one singlet for 4H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The protons of the two equivalent ethyl groups will split into two signals: a quartet for the four methylene (-CH2-) protons and a triplet for the six methyl (-CH3) protons. These are not singlets.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (4H), 1 aliphatic quartet (4H), 1 aliphatic triplet (6H).\n\n### **Evaluation of the Mixture Options**\n\nThe experimental data for the 1:1 mixture is:\n*   **Aromatic:** Two singlets (1:1 ratio).\n*   **Aliphatic:** Three singlets (2:1:1 ratio).\n\nNow, let's analyze the proposed mixtures:\n\n*   **Mixture A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB has one aromatic singlet (2H). 1,2,3,5-TMB also has one aromatic singlet (2H). If these have different chemical shifts, the 1:1 mixture would show **two singlets**, each integrating to 2H, giving a **1:1 ratio**. This matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB has one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,5-TMB has three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). If the 12H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB coincidentally overlaps with the 6H singlet from 1,2,3,5-TMB, the combined spectrum would show:\n        *   One singlet at the position of the two overlapping signals, with an integration of 12H + 6H = 18H.\n        *   Two other singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB with integrations of 3H and 3H.\n        The resulting ratio would be 18H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 6:1:1. This does not match the observed 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nLet's reconsider the analysis for 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. Some sources suggest it has two separate aromatic protons and three methyl signals. Let's re-examine the correct assignments based on chemical databases. The initial analysis of three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio for 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene is correct. The error was in the combination.\n\nLet's re-examine the options with a fresh perspective. We are looking for a combination that produces a total of two aromatic singlets and three aliphatic singlets with the specified ratios.\n\n*   **The total number of aliphatic signals is three.**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB has one.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB has three.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB has two.\n    *   1,4-diethylbenzene has zero singlets.\n\nIf we mix two of these, the total number of aliphatic singlets (assuming no overlaps) would be:\n*   A) 1 + 3 = 4\n*   B) 3 + 0 = 3\n*   C) 2 + 3 = 5\n*   D) 1 + 2 = 3\n\nThis simple count suggests that options **B** and **D** are the most plausible candidates for producing exactly three aliphatic singlets.\n\n*   **Let's analyze Mixture D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** Both compounds show one aromatic singlet (2H each). A 1:1 mixture will produce **two aromatic singlets** in a **1:1 ratio**, assuming different chemical shifts. This matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB: one singlet (12H).\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB: two singlets (6H each).\n    *   **Combined Aliphatic Spectrum:** This mixture would exhibit a total of **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **Let's re-analyze Mixture B: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** 1,2,3,5-TMB has one singlet (2H). 1,4-diethylbenzene has one singlet (4H). The mixture would show two singlets with a ratio of 2:4, or 1:2. This contradicts the observed 1:1 ratio.\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** 1,2,3,5-TMB has three singlets. 1,4-diethylbenzene has a quartet and a triplet. The mixture would contain three singlets, a quartet, and a triplet, which does not match the data.\n\nBased on this detailed analysis, the combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only one that fits all the spectral data.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nMy initial analysis was based on predicting the 1H NMR spectra from the structures of the compounds. The search results confirm my predictions.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** Due to its high symmetry, it shows one singlet for the two aromatic protons (~6.89 ppm) and one singlet for the twelve protons of the four equivalent methyl groups (~2.18 ppm).\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry. It shows one singlet for the two equivalent aromatic protons at positions 5 and 6 (~6.88 ppm). It has two distinct sets of methyl groups: the ones at positions 1 and 4 are equivalent, and the ones at positions 2 and 3 are equivalent. This results in two singlets of equal integration (6H each) in the alkyl region (~2.17 and ~2.24 ppm).\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This compound has lower symmetry. It has two non-equivalent aromatic protons, which should give two separate singlets (1H each). It has three sets of methyl groups in a 2:1:1 ratio (6H, 3H, 3H), which will result in three singlets in the alkyl region.\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** The spectrum of this compound shows signals for the aromatic protons (a singlet because they are all equivalent) and a characteristic ethyl group pattern (a quartet and a triplet), not just singlets in the alkyl region. This confirms it can be ruled out.\n\nNow, let's re-evaluate the mixture based on the confirmed spectral data for the compounds in option D.\n\n**Mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (1:1 ratio):**\n\n1.  **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet for its 2 aromatic protons.\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet for its 2 aromatic protons.\n    *   Since the chemical shifts are slightly different, the mixture will show **two singlets**. Because each signal comes from 2 protons and the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio, the two singlets will have a **1:1 integration ratio**. This matches the experimental data.\n\n2.  **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes **one singlet** corresponding to its 12 equivalent methyl protons.\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes **two singlets** corresponding to its two sets of non-equivalent methyl groups (6 protons each).\n    *   In total, the mixture will show **three singlets** in the alkyl region.\n    *   The integration ratio will be 12H (from 1,2,4,5-isomer) : 6H (from 1,2,3,4-isomer) : 6H (from 1,2,3,4-isomer).\n    *   This simplifies to a **2:1:1 ratio**. This also perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n*   **A)** 1,4-diethylbenzene does not give only singlets in the alkyl region.\n*   **B) and C)** Both of these options include 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, which itself has two aromatic protons that give two separate singlets. When mixed with another tetramethylbenzene isomer that gives one aromatic singlet (like 1,2,4,5- or 1,2,3,4-), the resulting mixture would show a total of three aromatic singlets, which contradicts the data.\n\nTherefore, the two compounds in the mixture are 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**1. Analyze the Provided 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's break down the information given about the 1H NMR spectrum of the 1:1 mixture:\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are isomers with the formula C10H14. All four options fit this formula.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals, both of which are singlets. Their integration ratio is 1:1.\n    *   A **singlet** in the aromatic region means the proton(s) responsible for that signal have no adjacent protons to couple with.\n    *   A 1:1 integration ratio in a 1:1 molar mixture implies that the total number of aromatic protons in the first compound is equal to the total number of aromatic protons in the second compound.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all of which are singlets. Their integration ratio is 2:1:1.\n    *   The fact that these are all **singlets** is a crucial piece of information. An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) would produce a quartet and a triplet due to spin-spin coupling, not singlets. This immediately tells us the alkyl groups are likely methyl groups (-CH3).\n\n**2. Evaluate Each Candidate Compound**\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring with two ethyl groups at opposite positions (para).\n    *   **Symmetry:** High. All four aromatic protons are chemically equivalent. The two ethyl groups are equivalent.\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:**\n        *   Aromatic: One singlet (for 4H).\n        *   Alkyl: One quartet (for the 4H of the two -CH2- groups) and one triplet (for the 6H of the two -CH3 groups).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is inconsistent with the data because its alkyl signals are a quartet and a triplet, not singlets. It also has 4 aromatic protons, whereas the tetramethylbenzenes have 2. This would lead to a 2:1 aromatic signal ratio in a mixture, not 1:1. **1,4-diethylbenzene is eliminated.** This rules out option A.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring with four adjacent methyl groups.\n    *   **Symmetry:** It has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:**\n        *   Aromatic: There are two protons at C5 and C6. They are chemically equivalent due to symmetry, but they are adjacent to each other. Therefore, they will couple and appear as an AB quartet (or two doublets if the chemical shift difference is large enough). They will **not** be singlets.\n        *   Alkyl: Two singlets of 6H each (C1/C4 methyls are equivalent, and C2/C3 methyls are equivalent).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is inconsistent with the data because its aromatic signal would not be a singlet. **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is eliminated.** This rules out options B and D.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring with methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n    *   **Symmetry:** High. It has two planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:**\n        *   Aromatic: Two protons at C3 and C6. They are equivalent and have no adjacent protons. This will give **one singlet (2H)**.\n        *   Alkyl: The four methyl groups are all equivalent. This will give **one singlet (12H)**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is a possible candidate.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring with methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 3, and 5.\n    *   **Symmetry:** Low. There are no planes of symmetry or rotational axes.\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:**\n        *   Aromatic: Two protons at C4 and C6. They are in different chemical environments and have no adjacent protons. This will give **two singlets (1H each)**.\n        *   Alkyl: The four methyl groups are all in different chemical environments. This should theoretically give four singlets. However, due to accidental equivalence (isochrony), where different protons have very similar chemical shifts, the spectrum is simpler. It typically shows **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H (which is 2:1:1), as two of the methyl groups happen to resonate at the same frequency.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is a possible candidate.\n\n**3. Analyze the Mixture of the Remaining Candidates**\n\nThe only remaining possibility is a mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**. Let's see if a 1:1 mixture of these two fits the data.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   Durene provides one singlet integrating to 2H.\n    *   Isodurene provides two singlets, each integrating to 1H.\n    *   The problem states we observe **two singlets** with a **1:1 ratio**. This can happen if the two 1H singlets from Isodurene are accidentally equivalent under the experimental conditions, appearing as a single singlet that integrates to 2H.\n    *   So, we would have: Signal 1 (from Durene, 2H) and Signal 2 (from Isodurene, 2H). This gives two singlets in a 1:1 ratio, which matches the data perfectly.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region:**\n    *   Durene provides one singlet integrating to 12H.\n    *   Isodurene provides three singlets integrating to 6H, 3H, and 3H.\n    *   The problem states we observe **three singlets** with a **2:1:1 ratio**.\n    *   Let's analyze the total protons and ratios. The total number of methyl protons in the 1:1 mixture is 12H (from Durene) + 12H (from Isodurene) = 24H. A 2:1:1 ratio means the total is split into 4 parts (2+1+1). So each part is 24H / 4 = 6H. The signals must therefore integrate to 12H (2 parts), 6H (1 part), and 6H (1 part).\n    *   Let's see if we can form this from our components:\n        *   The **12H signal** comes directly from Durene.\n        *   The first **6H signal** comes from the 6H signal of Isodurene.\n        *   The second **6H signal** can be formed if the two 3H signals from Isodurene are accidentally equivalent and overlap, appearing as a single signal.\n    *   This combination (12H, 6H, 6H) gives an integration ratio of 2:1:1 and results in three singlets. This also matches the data perfectly.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed 1:1, can produce the described 1H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**1. Analyze the given information:**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture:** 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   Aromatic region (~6.7 ppm): Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   Aliphatic region (~2.2 ppm): Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n**2. Verify the Molecular Formula of the Options:**\nFirst, let's confirm that all the given compounds have the molecular formula C10H14.\n*   Tetramethylbenzenes: The base benzene ring is C6. Four methyl groups (CH3) replace four hydrogens. The formula is C6H(6-4)(CH3)4 = C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. This is true for 1,2,4,5-, 1,2,3,5-, and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n*   1,4-diethylbenzene: The base benzene ring is C6. Two ethyl groups (C2H5) replace two hydrogens. The formula is C6H(6-2)(C2H5)2 = C6H4(C4H10) = C10H14.\nAll options have the correct molecular formula.\n\n**3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound:**\nWe need to determine the number of signals, their multiplicity (singlet, doublet, etc.), and their relative integrations for each compound.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   Due to symmetry, the four aromatic protons are equivalent, producing a single singlet (4H).\n    *   The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The CH2 protons will be a quartet (4H) and the CH3 protons will be a triplet (6H).\n    *   Since the problem states there are only singlets in the aliphatic region, any mixture containing 1,4-diethylbenzene can be ruled out. This eliminates option **C**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** The two protons at C3 and C6 are equivalent. They will produce one singlet (2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They will produce one singlet (12H).\n    *   *Spectrum Summary:* 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   A plane of symmetry bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are equivalent. Although they are adjacent, in many cases they appear as a singlet due to similar magnetic environments or small coupling constant. We will assume they give one singlet (2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent (one signal, 6H). The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent to each other but different from the first pair (second signal, 6H). Both will be singlets.\n    *   *Spectrum Summary:* 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 aliphatic singlets (6H each).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   A plane of symmetry passes through C2 and C5.\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent. They will produce one singlet (2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (one signal, 6H).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique (second signal, 3H).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique (third signal, 3H).\n    *   *Spectrum Summary:* 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 3 aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n\n**4. Analyze the 1:1 Mixture Spectrum:**\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:** The mixture shows two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   Each of the three tetramethylbenzene isomers gives a single aromatic singlet integrating to 2H.\n    *   A 1:1 mixture of any two of these isomers will have two sets of aromatic protons, each contributing 2H. Assuming their chemical shifts are different, this will result in two singlets, each with an integration of 2H. The ratio 2H:2H is 1:1.\n    *   Therefore, the aromatic region data is consistent with any pair of the tetramethylbenzene isomers.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region:** The mixture shows three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n    *   Since it's a 1:1 mixture, the total number of aliphatic protons is the sum from both compounds: 12H + 12H = 24H.\n    *   A 2:1:1 ratio of a total of 24 protons means the integrations of the three signals are:\n        *   Signal 1: (2 / (2+1+1)) * 24H = (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n        *   Signal 2: (1 / (2+1+1)) * 24H = (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n        *   Signal 3: (1 / (2+1+1)) * 24H = (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   So, we are looking for a combination of two compounds that gives three aliphatic signals with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n**5. Evaluate the Remaining Options based on the Aliphatic Signals:**\n\nLet's see which pair of compounds produces the required set of signals {12H, 6H, 6H}. We'll combine the aliphatic signals predicted for each compound in the pair.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   Durene provides: {one 12H singlet}\n    *   Isodurene provides: {one 6H singlet, one 3H singlet, one 3H singlet}\n    *   Combined signals: {12H, 6H, 3H, 3H}. This is four signals, not three. This option is incorrect, unless one assumes the two 3H signals from Isodurene accidentally overlap, which is a significant assumption.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene) + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   Prehnitene provides: {one 6H singlet, one 6H singlet}\n    *   Isodurene provides: {one 6H singlet, one 3H singlet, one 3H singlet}\n    *   Combined signals: {6H, 6H, 6H, 3H, 3H}. This is five signals. This is a very poor match for the \"three signals\" described.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) + 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   Durene provides: {one 12H singlet}\n    *   Prehnitene provides: {one 6H singlet, one 6H singlet}\n    *   Combined signals: {12H, 6H, 6H}.\n    *   This combination gives exactly three signals with the correct integrations (12H, 6H, 6H), which corresponds to the observed 2:1:1 ratio. This assumes that the three signals (the one from Durene and the two from Prehnitene) are all resolved and do not overlap. This is the most straightforward interpretation of the data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only one that directly explains the aliphatic signals described in the problem (three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Information from the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\nThe problem provides the following key details about the 1H NMR spectrum of a 1:1 mixture of two C10H14 isomers:\n\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals.\n    *   Both are singlets.\n    *   They have an integration ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals.\n    *   All are singlets.\n    *   They have an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\nThe fact that all signals are singlets is a crucial clue. This means that none of the observed protons have any non-equivalent protons on adjacent carbon atoms.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nLet's analyze the structure of each of the four possible compounds to predict what its individual 1H NMR spectrum would look like. This involves looking at the molecule's symmetry.\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has two planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they appear as a **single singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-CH₃):** Due to symmetry, all four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will appear as a **single singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H) and 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n2.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. Equivalent protons do not split each other, so they appear as a **single singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-CH₃):** The symmetry creates two sets of equivalent methyl groups:\n        *   The methyls at C1 and C4 are equivalent: **1 singlet, 6H**.\n        *   The methyls at C2 and C3 are equivalent: **1 singlet, 6H**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H) and 2 aliphatic singlets (6H each).\n\n3.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has very low symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** The proton at C4 and the proton at C6 are in different chemical environments. Neither has an adjacent proton. This results in **two separate singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-CH₃):** All four methyl groups are in unique environments, resulting in **four separate singlets**, each integrating to **3H**.\n    *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each) and 4 aliphatic singlets (3H each).\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C₆H₄(C₂H₅)₂ = C₁₀H₁₄.\n    *   **Signals:** The ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃) would show splitting. The -CH₂- signal would be a quartet, and the -CH₃- signal would be a triplet.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the problem states all signals are singlets, **this compound can be eliminated** immediately.\n\n### **Step 3: Combine the Spectra to Match the Mixture Data**\n\nWe need to find a pair of compounds from the remaining three that, when mixed 1:1, matches the observed spectrum.\n\nLet's test the combination from **Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Aromatic Signals:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet (2H).\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet (2H).\n    *   **Total:** This gives **two singlets**. Since the mixture is 1:1, the protons contributing to each signal are present in equal amounts (2H from the first compound, 2H from the second). The integration ratio is 2:2, which simplifies to **1:1**. This perfectly matches the data.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Signals:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet (12H).\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes two singlets (each 6H).\n    *   **Total:** This gives **three singlets**. The integrations are for 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   The integration ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the data.\n\nThis combination successfully explains all features of the given NMR spectrum. The other options would not work. For instance, any combination with 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene would produce at least three aromatic signals, which contradicts the data.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nBased on the detailed analysis and confirmation from the code, the correct pair of compounds is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\nHere is a summary of why this combination works:\n*   **Aromatic Region:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one aromatic singlet for its 2 equivalent protons. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene also gives one aromatic singlet for its 2 equivalent protons. A 1:1 mixture of these two compounds will therefore show two distinct singlets with a 1:1 integral ratio, matching the experimental data.\n*   **Alkyl Region:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene is highly symmetric and gives a single signal for its four equivalent methyl groups (12H). 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene has two sets of equivalent methyl groups, giving two signals (6H each). When combined, the mixture shows three singlet signals with integrals of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio of these integrals is 12:6:6, which simplifies to 2:1:1, perfectly matching the experimental data.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nAnalyse der einzelnen Verbindungen:\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzol (Duren)**:\n    *   **Symmetrie**: Dieses Molekül ist hochsymmetrisch.\n    *   **Aromatische Protonen**: Es gibt zwei äquivalente aromatische Protonen (an den Positionen C3 und C6). Dies führt zu **einem Singulett** (2H) im aromatischen Bereich.\n    *   **Methylprotonen**: Alle vier Methylgruppen sind chemisch äquivalent. Dies führt zu **einem Singulett** (12H) im aliphatischen Bereich.\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzol (Isoduren)**:\n    *   **Symmetrie**: Dieses Molekül hat eine Symmetrieebene, die durch C2 und C5 verläuft.\n    *   **Aromatische Protonen**: Die beiden Protonen an C4 und C6 sind äquivalent. Dies führt zu **einem Singulett** (2H) im aromatischen Bereich.\n    *   **Methylprotonen**: Es gibt drei Sätze chemisch nicht äquivalenter Methylgruppen: die beiden äquivalenten Gruppen an C1 und C3 (6H), die einzelne Gruppe an C2 (3H) und die einzelne Gruppe an C5 (3H). Dies führt zu **drei Singuletts** im aliphatischen Bereich mit einem Integralverhältnis von 6:3:3, was einem Verhältnis von **2:1:1** entspricht.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzol (Prehniten)**:\n    *   **Aromatische Protonen**: Es gibt zwei Protonen an den Positionen C5 und C6. Da sie benachbart sind, koppeln sie miteinander und erzeugen ein System von **zwei Dubletts**, keine Singuletts. Diese Verbindung kann also ausgeschlossen werden.\n    *   **Methylprotonen**: Es gibt zwei Sätze äquivalenter Methylgruppen (C1/C4 und C2/C3), die zu zwei Singuletts im Verhältnis 1:1 (6H:6H) führen würden.\n\n4.  **1,4-Diethylbenzol**:\n    *   **Aromatische Protonen**: Alle vier aromatischen Protonen sind äquivalent, was zu **einem Singulett** (4H) führt.\n    *   **Alkylprotonen**: Die Ethylgruppen würden ein **Quartett** (CH₂) und ein **Triplett** (CH₃) erzeugen, keine Singuletts. Diese Verbindung kann also ausgeschlossen werden.\n\n**Analyse der Mischung:**\n\nDas 1H-NMR-Spektrum der 1:1-Mischung zeigt:\n*   **Aromatischer Bereich (~6,7 ppm)**: Zwei Singuletts im Verhältnis 1:1.\n*   **Aliphatischer Bereich (~2,2 ppm)**: Drei Singuletts im Verhältnis 2:1:1.\n\nBetrachten wir nun die Optionen:\n\n*   A) 1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzol und 1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzol: Falsch, da 1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzol Dubletts im aromatischen Bereich erzeugen würde.\n*   B) 1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzol und 1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzol: Falsch, aus demselben Grund wie A.\n*   D) 1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzol und 1,4-Diethylbenzol: Falsch, da 1,4-Diethylbenzol ein Quartett und ein Triplett im aliphatischen Bereich erzeugen würde.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzol und 1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzol**:\n    *   **Aromatischer Bereich**: 1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzol liefert ein Singulett (2H). 1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzol liefert ebenfalls ein Singulett (2H). Bei unterschiedlichen chemischen Verschiebungen führt eine 1:1-Mischung zu zwei Singuletts mit einem Integralverhältnis von 2H:2H, also 1:1. **Dies passt perfekt.**\n    *   **Aliphatischer Bereich**: In der 1:1-Mischung stammen die aliphatischen Protonen von beiden Verbindungen. Die Gesamtzahl der Methylprotonen beträgt 12 (von 1,2,4,5-) + 12 (von 1,2,3,5-) = 24. Das angegebene Verhältnis von 2:1:1 bedeutet, dass die Integrale der drei Signale 12H, 6H und 6H sein müssen ((2/4)*24H=12H, (1/4)*24H=6H, (1/4)*24H=6H).\n        *   1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzol liefert ein Singulett mit einem Integral von **12H**.\n        *   1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzol liefert Signale mit Integralen von **6H**, 3H und 3H.\n        *   Um die beobachteten drei Signale (12H, 6H, 6H) zu erhalten, muss das 12H-Signal von 1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzol, das 6H-Signal von 1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzol und ein weiteres 6H-Signal vorhanden sein. Dieses dritte Signal muss aus der zufälligen Überlagerung (gleiche chemische Verschiebung) der beiden 3H-Signale von 1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzol resultieren.\n\nDiese Kombination ist die einzige, die mit den Spektraldaten übereinstimmt.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nAn analysis of the 1H NMR spectra for each of the potential compounds is required to solve this problem. We are looking for a 1:1 mixture of two compounds that matches the following spectral data:\n\n*   **Aromatic region:** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio (~6.7 ppm).\n*   **Aliphatic region:** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio (~2.2 ppm).\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n\nLet's analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each option:\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single singlet (representing 2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups are also chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce a single singlet (representing 12H).\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has less symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments and are not equivalent. This would result in two separate aromatic singlets (each representing 1H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are in unique chemical environments, which would lead to four different aliphatic singlets.\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 4 aliphatic singlets (3H each).\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce a single singlet (representing 2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The methyl groups at positions 1 and 4 are equivalent, and the methyl groups at positions 2 and 3 are equivalent. This results in two distinct aliphatic singlets (each representing 6H).\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 aliphatic singlets (6H each).\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are chemically equivalent, producing a single singlet (4H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The protons of the ethyl groups will show splitting. The two CH2 groups are equivalent and will appear as a quartet, while the two CH3 groups are equivalent and will appear as a triplet. This does not match the \"all singlets\" description for the aliphatic region. Therefore, this compound can be eliminated.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the mixtures presented in the options:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** This mixture would produce three aromatic signals (one 2H singlet from 1,2,3,4-TMB and two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB), which contradicts the data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** This mixture would also produce three aromatic signals (one 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB and two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB), contradicting the data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet, and 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. Assuming their chemical shifts are different, this will result in **two singlets**. Since it is a 1:1 molar mixture and both signals represent 2H, their integration ratio will be **1:1**. This perfectly matches the aromatic data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (12H), and 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H each). This results in a total of **three aliphatic singlets**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Ratio:** In a 1:1 mixture, the ratio of protons in these three signals will be 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches the aliphatic data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** This option is incorrect because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not give only singlets in its aliphatic region.\n\nTherefore, the only pair that fits all the spectral data is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Analyze the given 1H NMR data:**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture:** 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integral ratio. This indicates that each of the two compounds in the mixture has chemically equivalent aromatic protons, giving rise to a singlet. Since the mixture is 1:1 and the signals have a 1:1 ratio, the number of aromatic protons in each compound must be the same.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integral ratio. These signals must come from the methyl (or ethyl) groups of the two compounds combined.\n\n**2. Analyze the 1H NMR spectrum of each possible compound:**\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Formula:** C10H14. Correct.\n    *   **Symmetry:** Very high. There are two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C3 and C6 are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Formula:** C10H14. Correct.\n    *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry passes through the C2 and C5 methyl groups.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three sets of non-equivalent methyl groups:\n        *   C1 and C3 methyls are equivalent (6H).\n        *   C2 methyl is unique (3H).\n        *   C5 methyl is unique (3H).\n        *   This gives **three singlets** with an integral ratio of 6:3:3, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Formula:** C10H14. Correct.\n    *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two sets of non-equivalent methyl groups:\n        *   C1 and C4 methyls are equivalent (6H).\n        *   C2 and C3 methyls are equivalent (6H).\n        *   This gives **two singlets** with an integral ratio of 6:6, which simplifies to **1:1**.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Formula:** C10H14. Correct.\n    *   **Symmetry:** Very high.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four protons on the ring are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet (4H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The ethyl groups are not singlets. The -CH2- protons will be a quartet and the -CH3 protons will be a triplet. The problem explicitly states that all signals in the aliphatic region are singlets, so **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**. This rules out option C.\n\n**3. Evaluate the mixtures:**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that gives:\n*   **Aromatic:** Two singlets (1:1 ratio). All three tetramethylbenzene isomers give a 2H singlet. A 1:1 mixture of any two will result in two singlets with a 1:1 integral ratio (2H:2H). So, this information alone is not enough to distinguish between options A, B, and D.\n*   **Aliphatic:** Three singlets (2:1:1 ratio). Let's check the combinations.\n\nLet's assume there is no accidental overlap of signals from the different compounds.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   1,2,4,5- gives one aliphatic singlet (12H).\n    *   1,2,3,5- gives three aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   Total signals = 1 + 3 = 4 aliphatic singlets. This does not match the data (three signals).\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   1,2,3,4- gives two aliphatic singlets (6H, 6H).\n    *   1,2,3,5- gives three aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   Total signals = 2 + 3 = 5 aliphatic singlets (unless there is overlap). This does not match the data (three signals).\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   1,2,4,5- gives **one** aliphatic singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,4- gives **two** aliphatic singlets.\n    *   Total signals = 1 + 2 = **three** aliphatic singlets. This matches the number of signals observed.\n    *   Let's check the ratio. The signals correspond to:\n        *   One 12H singlet (from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene).\n        *   One 6H singlet (from 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene).\n        *   Another 6H singlet (from 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene).\n    *   The integral ratio is 12H:6H:6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match for the aliphatic region data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only one that perfectly accounts for all the features of the given 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the two compounds in the mixture:\n\n### **1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's break down the information provided from the 1H NMR spectrum of the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. This indicates that there are two distinct types of aromatic protons in the mixture, and the total number of protons for each signal is the same.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. This points to three different types of methyl groups in the mixture.\n\n### **2. Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum of Each Option**\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds. All compounds have the molecular formula C10H14.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** Due to its high symmetry, it will show:\n    *   **Aromatic:** One singlet (2H), as the protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent.\n    *   **Alkyl:** One singlet (12H), as all four methyl groups are equivalent.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry. It will show:\n    *   **Aromatic:** One singlet (2H), as the protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent.\n    *   **Alkyl:** Two singlets (6H each), corresponding to the two pairs of equivalent methyl groups (C1/C4 and C2/C3). The ratio would be 1:1.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has lower symmetry. It will show:\n    *   **Aromatic:** Two singlets (1H each), for the non-equivalent protons at C4 and C6.\n    *   **Alkyl:** Three singlets with an integration ratio of 2:1:1 (corresponding to 6H for the C1/C3 pair, 3H for the C2 methyl, and 3H for the C5 methyl).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** Due to symmetry, it will show:\n    *   **Aromatic:** One singlet (4H), as all four aromatic protons are equivalent.\n    *   **Alkyl:** A quartet (4H, -CH2-) and a triplet (6H, -CH3-). The presence of quartets and triplets (due to splitting) means this compound can be ruled out, as the problem states only singlets are observed in the alkyl region. This eliminates option **D**.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Remaining Options**\n\nNow, let's consider the NMR spectra for a 1:1 mixture of the remaining pairs.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** One singlet (2H) from 1,2,4,5- and two singlets (1H each) from 1,2,3,5-. This would result in three signals, which contradicts the data.\n    *   **Alkyl signals:** One singlet (12H) from 1,2,4,5- and three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H) from 1,2,3,5-. This would result in four distinct signals. This does not match the observed spectrum.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** One singlet (2H) from 1,2,3,4- and two singlets (1H each) from 1,2,3,5-. This would result in three signals, which is inconsistent with the data.\n    *   **Alkyl signals:** Two singlets (6H each) from 1,2,3,4- and three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H) from 1,2,3,5-. This combination does not readily produce a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one singlet for its 2 aromatic protons. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene also provides one singlet for its 2 aromatic protons. In a 1:1 mixture, these two non-equivalent singlets would each correspond to 2 protons, resulting in the observed **two singlets in a 1:1 ratio**.\n    *   **Alkyl signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one singlet for its 12 methyl protons. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene gives two singlets, each for 6 methyl protons. Combining these gives three singlets with integrations corresponding to 12H, 6H, and 6H. This simplifies to the observed **2:1:1 ratio**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only one that perfectly matches both the aromatic and alkyl region data from the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the predicted 1H NMR spectra for each of the possible compounds and then see which 1:1 mixture would produce the spectrum described.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the given NMR data:**\n    *   Molecular Formula: C10H14 for both compounds.\n    *   Aromatic region: Two singlets with a 1:1 integral ratio. This means each compound in the 1:1 mixture must contribute one aromatic singlet, and each of these singlets must correspond to the same number of protons.\n    *   Aliphatic region: Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integral ratio. These signals must arise from the methyl/ethyl groups of the two compounds combined.\n\n2.  **Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each candidate molecule:**\n    *   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** Due to high symmetry, it will show one singlet for the two aromatic protons (H-3, H-6) and one singlet for the twelve protons of the four equivalent methyl groups.\n    *   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** Due to a single plane of symmetry, it will show one singlet for the two equivalent aromatic protons (H-4, H-6) and three singlets for the methyl groups (one for 6H from Me-1 and Me-3, one for 3H from Me-2, and one for 3H from Me-5), with an integral ratio of 2:1:1.\n    *   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** Due to symmetry, it will show one singlet for the two equivalent aromatic protons (H-5, H-6) and two singlets for the methyl groups (one for 6H from Me-1 and Me-4, and one for 6H from Me-2 and Me-3), with an integral ratio of 1:1.\n    *   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** It will show one singlet for the four equivalent aromatic protons. The ethyl groups will show a quartet (for the 4H of the two CH2 groups) and a triplet (for the 6H of the two CH3 groups). The presence of a quartet and triplet rules this compound out, as the problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the options based on a 1:1 mixture:**\n    *   We will combine the predicted spectra for the compounds in each option and compare the result to the experimental data.\n\n```python\ndef solve_nmr_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes potential compounds to match a given 1H NMR spectrum of a mixture.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing the problem based on the 1H NMR data for a 1:1 mixture of two C10H14 isomers.\")\n    print(\"Experimental Data:\")\n    print(\"- Aromatic region (~6.7 ppm): 2 singlets, 1:1 ratio.\")\n    print(\"- Aliphatic region (~2.2 ppm): 3 singlets, 2:1:1 ratio.\\n\")\n\n    # Predicted spectra for individual compounds\n    spectra = {\n        \"1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\": {\n            \"Aromatic H\": \"1 singlet (2H)\",\n            \"Aliphatic H\": \"1 singlet (12H)\",\n            \"Aliphatic Signals\": 1,\n            \"Aliphatic Integrals\": [12]\n        },\n        \"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\": {\n            \"Aromatic H\": \"1 singlet (2H)\",\n            \"Aliphatic H\": \"3 singlets (6H, 3H, 3H -> ratio 2:1:1)\",\n            \"Aliphatic Signals\": 3,\n            \"Aliphatic Integrals\": [6, 3, 3]\n        },\n        \"1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\": {\n            \"Aromatic H\": \"1 singlet (2H)\",\n            \"Aliphatic H\": \"2 singlets (6H, 6H -> ratio 1:1)\",\n            \"Aliphatic Signals\": 2,\n            \"Aliphatic Integrals\": [6, 6]\n        },\n        \"1,4-diethylbenzene\": {\n            \"Aromatic H\": \"1 singlet (4H)\",\n            \"Aliphatic H\": \"1 quartet (4H) and 1 triplet (6H)\",\n            \"Aliphatic Signals\": \"Non-singlets\",\n            \"Aliphatic Integrals\": []\n        }\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Predicted spectra for individual compounds:\")\n    for compound, spec in spectra.items():\n        print(f\"- {compound}:\")\n        print(f\"  Aromatic: {spec['Aromatic H']}\")\n        print(f\"  Aliphatic: {spec['Aliphatic H']}\")\n    print(\"\\nNote: 1,4-diethylbenzene is ruled out as it produces non-singlet signals (a quartet and a triplet) in the aliphatic region.\\n\")\n\n    # Options Analysis\n    options = {\n        \"A\": [\"1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\"],\n        \"B\": [\"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,4-diethylbenzene\"],\n        \"C\": [\"1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\"],\n        \"D\": [\"1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\", \"1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\"]\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Evaluating the options for a 1:1 mixture:\")\n    correct_option = None\n    for option, compounds in options.items():\n        print(f\"--- Option {option}: {compounds[0]} and {compounds[1]} ---\")\n        \n        # Check if any compound is invalid\n        if spectra[compounds[0]]['Aliphatic Signals'] == 'Non-singlets' or spectra[compounds[1]]['Aliphatic Signals'] == 'Non-singlets':\n            print(\"Result: Does not match.

The 1H NMR spectrum of this mixture shows:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** The integration ratios (1:1 for aromatic, 2:1:1 for aliphatic) refer to the total protons from *both* compounds in the mixture contributing to those signals.\n**Careful Point 2:** The splitting pattern is crucial. The presence of only singlets in the aliphatic region is a major clue.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum of Each Potential Compound Individually**\n\nLet's predict the spectrum for each of the four given options.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High symmetry (D2h).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four ring protons are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they appear as **one singlet (4H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The CH2 protons are split by the CH3 protons, giving a **quartet (4H)**. The CH3 protons are split by the CH2 protons, giving a **triplet (6H)**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound gives a quartet and a triplet. The problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene cannot be one of the compounds**. This eliminates option B.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High symmetry (D2h).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent. They have no adjacent protons. They will appear as **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry (C2v).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. Although they are adjacent, coupled equivalent protons appear as a singlet. So, they give **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. They give **one singlet (6H)**.\n        *   The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent. They give **one singlet (6H)**.\n        *   Total aliphatic signals: Two singlets in a 6H:6H (or 1:1) ratio.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry (Cs).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The proton at C4 and the proton at C6 are not equivalent. Neither has an adjacent proton. This results in **two singlets (each 1H)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent. They give **one singlet (6H)**.\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique. It gives **one singlet (3H)**.\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique. It gives **one singlet (3H)**.\n        *   Total aliphatic signals: Three singlets in a 6H:3H:3H (or 2:1:1) ratio.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the 1:1 Mixtures based on the Individual Spectra**\n\nNow, let's test the remaining options (A, C, and D) by combining the predicted spectra for a 1:1 mixture.\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene) + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** Prehnitene gives one singlet (2H). Isodurene gives two singlets (1H each). The mixture would show three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio (assuming no overlap). This contradicts the data of \"two singlets in a 1:1 ratio\".\n\n*   **Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** Durene gives one singlet (2H). Isodurene gives two singlets (1H each). The mixture would show three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio (assuming no overlap). This contradicts the data of \"two singlets in a 1:1 ratio\".\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) + 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:**\n        *   Durene gives one singlet for its 2 aromatic protons.\n        *   Prehnitene gives one singlet for its 2 aromatic protons.\n        *   Assuming they have different chemical shifts, the mixture will show **two singlets**.\n        *   Since it is a 1:1 mixture, each singlet represents 2H. The integration ratio is 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This perfectly matches the experimental data.\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:**\n        *   Durene gives one singlet for its 12 methyl protons.\n        *   Prehnitene gives two separate singlets, each for 6 methyl protons.\n        *   In total, the mixture will show **three singlets**.\n        *   The integrations will be 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only combination that produces the 1H NMR spectrum described in the problem.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Information Provided in the 1H NMR Spectrum\n\nWe are given the spectrum of a 1:1 molar mixture of two compounds. Let's denote the two unknown compounds as A and B.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds have the formula C10H14.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals, both singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n    *   Since the mixture is 1:1, let's say we have 1 mole of compound A and 1 mole of compound B.\n    *   The total number of aromatic protons must be an even number. Two signals in a 1:1 ratio means that the number of protons contributing to the first signal is equal to the number of protons contributing to the second signal.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n    *   This tells us there are three distinct sets of aliphatic protons, and all of them are on carbons with no adjacent protons (hence, they are singlets). This strongly suggests the aliphatic groups are methyl (CH3) groups attached to the aromatic ring, as ethyl groups would show quartets and triplets.\n\n### Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound\n\nWe need to analyze the structure of each of the four possible compounds to predict the number of signals, their multiplicity, and their integration. The key here is to identify the chemical equivalence of protons based on the molecule's symmetry.\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetric. It has two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will produce a single **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups (at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5) are equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce a single **singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H) and 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n2.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They are adjacent (ortho) but since they are equivalent (an AA' system), they appear as a single **singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent, but this pair is different from the C1/C4 pair. This results in two distinct **singlets**, each integrating to **6H**.\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H) and 2 alkyl singlets (6H each).\n\n3.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has no elements of symmetry (besides identity).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The proton at C4 and the proton at C6 are in different chemical environments. They will produce two distinct **singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups (at C1, C2, C3, and C5) are in unique environments. This will result in four distinct **singlets**, each integrating to **3H**.\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each) and 4 alkyl singlets (3H each).\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High symmetry, similar to durene.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** This compound has ethyl groups. The CH2 protons will be a quartet and the CH3 protons will be a triplet.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The problem states that the aliphatic signals are all singlets. Therefore, any option containing 1,4-diethylbenzene can be immediately eliminated. This rules out option A.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Spectra of the Proposed Mixtures\n\nNow we evaluate the remaining options by combining the predicted spectra in a 1:1 ratio. The total number of aliphatic (methyl) protons in any 1:1 mixture will be 12 + 12 = 24.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region Goal:** Two singlets with a 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic Region Goal:** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio. For 24 total protons, this corresponds to integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n**Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n\n*   **Aromatic Signals:**\n    *   Durene contributes one 2H singlet.\n    *   Prehnitene contributes one 2H singlet.\n    *   Assuming these have different chemical shifts, the mixture will show **two singlets**, each corresponding to 2H. This gives a **1:1 ratio**. This matches the experimental data perfectly.\n*   **Aliphatic Signals:**\n    *   Durene contributes one 12H singlet.\n    *   Prehnitene contributes two 6H singlets.\n    *   If all three of these singlets have different chemical shifts, the mixture will show **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. This gives a **2:1:1 ratio** (12:6:6). This also matches the experimental data perfectly.\n\nThis combination of compounds provides a perfect explanation for all the spectral data without requiring any unusual coincidental signal overlaps.\n\nLet's quickly check why other options fail:\n\n*   **Option B (Durene + Isodurene):** Would give three aromatic signals (2H, 1H, 1H), not two.\n*   **Option C (Prehnitene + Isodurene):** Would give three aromatic signals (2H, 1H, 1H), not two.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only pair of compounds that produces the described 1H NMR spectrum in a 1:1 mixture is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nTo solve this problem, we must analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each potential compound and then determine which 1:1 mixture matches the provided spectral data.\n\n### Analysis of Individual Compounds\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Due to its high symmetry, there is only one type of aromatic proton and one type of methyl proton.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons on the ring are equivalent, leading to a single signal (a 2H singlet).\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups are equivalent, resulting in a single signal (a 12H singlet).\n    *   **Summary:** One 2H aromatic singlet, one 12H aliphatic singlet.\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** There are two distinct aromatic protons which are not coupled to each other. This results in two separate 1H singlets.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1 and C3 (6H), the one at C2 (3H), and the one at C5 (3H). This leads to three aliphatic singlets with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n    *   **Summary:** Two 1H aromatic singlets, three aliphatic singlets (2:1:1 ratio).\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two aromatic protons at C5 and C6 are chemically equivalent. They are adjacent, forming an AA' system that appears as a single 2H signal, which is typically observed as a singlet in low-resolution spectra.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1 and C4 (6H) and the pair at C2 and C3 (6H). This gives two aliphatic singlets with a 6H:6H integration ratio, which simplifies to 1:1.\n    *   **Summary:** One 2H aromatic singlet, two 1H aliphatic singlets (1:1 ratio).\n\n4.  **1,4-Diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are equivalent due to symmetry and produce a single 4H singlet.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The spectrum shows characteristic signals for an ethyl group: a quartet for the -CH2- protons and a triplet for the -CH3- protons. This does not match the problem's description of only singlets in the aliphatic region.\n    *   **Summary:** One 4H aromatic singlet, one 4H aliphatic quartet, and one 6H aliphatic triplet. This compound can be eliminated.\n\n### Analysis of the 1:1 Mixture\n\nThe spectrum of the 1:1 mixture shows:\n*   **Aromatic region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nLet's test the remaining options:\n\n*   **Option A (1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB):** The aromatic region would contain a 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB and two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB. This would result in three signals with a 2:1:1 ratio, which contradicts the observed data.\n\n*   **Option B (1,2,3,4-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB):** The aromatic region would contain a 2H singlet from 1,2,3,4-TMB and two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB. This would also result in three signals with a 2:1:1 ratio, which is inconsistent with the data.\n\n*   **Option C (1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,4-TMB):**\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** 1,2,4,5-TMB provides one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB also provides one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this combination would produce two singlets, each integrating to 2H. The ratio of these two signals would be 1:1, perfectly matching the description.\n    *   **Aliphatic Spectrum:** 1,2,4,5-TMB provides one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB provides two 6H singlets. The combined spectrum would exhibit three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio of these signals is 12:6:6, which simplifies to 2:1:1. This also perfectly matches the description.\n\n*   **Option D (1,2,3,5-TMB + 1,4-diethylbenzene):** This option is ruled out because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce only singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\nBased on this analysis, the mixture must contain 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nTo determine which two compounds are in the mixture, we must analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each of the potential compounds and compare it to the data provided.\n\nThe experimental data for the 1:1 mixture is:\n*   **Aromatic region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets in a 1:1 integral ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 integral ratio.\n\nThis implies that each compound in the 1:1 mixture contributes one aromatic singlet, and the protons responsible for each of these singlets are equal in number. Let's analyze the spectra of the candidate molecules.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** Due to its high symmetry, the two aromatic protons are chemically equivalent, producing a single signal. The four methyl groups are also equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** One singlet (2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** One singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that makes the two aromatic protons (at positions 5 and 6) equivalent. This results in a single aromatic signal. The four methyl groups are in two different chemical environments (1- and 4-methyl groups are equivalent, and 2- and 3-methyl groups are equivalent).\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** One singlet (2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** Two singlets (6H each).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule is unsymmetrical. The two aromatic protons (at positions 4 and 6) are in different chemical environments. Therefore, it would show two signals in the aromatic region.\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Two singlets (1H each).\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** Multiple singlets.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** Due to symmetry, the four aromatic protons are equivalent, giving one signal. The two ethyl groups are equivalent, but each ethyl group shows a quartet for the -CH2- group and a triplet for the -CH3- group due to spin-spin splitting. The problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets.\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** One singlet (4H).\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** One quartet (4H) and one triplet (6H).\n\n**Analysis of the Mixture**\n\nLet's test the combination from option C, which includes **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**, in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one singlet (for 2 protons).\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene provides one singlet (for 2 protons).\n    *   The mixture would show **two distinct singlets**. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio and each signal represents 2 protons, the integration ratio would be **1:1**. This matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one singlet (for 12 protons).\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene provides two singlets (each for 6 protons).\n    *   The mixture would show a total of **three singlets** in the aliphatic region (assuming they have different chemical shifts).\n    *   The relative integration of these signals would be based on the number of protons they represent: 12H, 6H, and 6H. This simplifies to a ratio of **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\nNo other combination of the given options fits the spectral data. For instance, any mixture containing 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene would result in three aromatic signals in total, and any mixture with 1,4-diethylbenzene would show quartets and triplets instead of only singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\nTherefore, the two compounds present in the mixture are 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nTo solve this, we must determine the expected 1H NMR signals for each potential compound and then see which 1:1 mixture matches the spectral data provided.\n\n### Analysis of the Provided NMR Data\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:** The spectrum shows two singlets at ~6.7 ppm with a 1:1 integral ratio. This means the mixture contains two different types of aromatic protons, and they are present in equal amounts. A singlet indicates that these protons have no adjacent proton neighbors.\n*   **Alkyl Region:** The spectrum displays three singlets at ~2.2 ppm with a 2:1:1 integral ratio. These signals correspond to the methyl (–CH₃) groups on the benzene rings. Singlets here indicate the methyl groups are not adjacent to any non-equivalent protons.\n\n### Predicted 1H NMR Spectra for Each Compound\n\nLet's analyze the expected spectrum for each of the four compounds based on their molecular symmetry.\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single signal. Since they have no adjacent protons, this signal will be a **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are also chemically equivalent due to symmetry. This will result in a **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has less symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments and have no adjacent proton neighbors. This results in **two separate singlets (1H each)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at positions 1 and 3 are equivalent to each other. The methyl group at position 2 is unique, and the methyl group at position 5 is unique. This leads to **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent due to a plane of symmetry. Equivalent protons do not split each other, so they produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at 1 and 4 are equivalent, and the methyl groups at 2 and 3 are equivalent. This results in **two singlets** with a 6H:6H or **1:1** integration ratio.\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four aromatic protons are chemically equivalent due to symmetry, producing **one singlet (4H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. Each ethyl group consists of a methylene (–CH₂–) and a methyl (–CH₃) group. These would produce a quartet and a triplet, not singlets. This compound can be eliminated immediately based on the alkyl region data.\n\n### Evaluating the Mixtures\n\nNow, let's determine which 1:1 mixture corresponds to the observed spectrum.\n\n*   The data shows **three alkyl singlets** in a **2:1:1 ratio**. Looking at our individual analyses, only **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene** produces this exact pattern on its own.\n*   The data also shows **two aromatic singlets** in a **1:1 ratio**.\n    *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene by itself has two aromatic singlets, but their integrals would be 1H each.\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene has one aromatic singlet with an integral of 2H.\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene has one aromatic singlet with an integral of 2H.\n\nLet's test the option containing 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene alongside another compound that could fit the remaining data.\n\n**Consider the mixture in Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.**\n\n*   **Alkyl Region:**\n    *   From 1,2,3,5-TMB: Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio (representing 6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   From 1,2,4,5-TMB: One singlet (representing 12H).\n    *   The combined spectrum would show four signals, which contradicts the data.\n\nThere seems to be a contradiction. Let's re-read the prompt carefully. *\"...three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio.\"* This ratio describes the signals for the **entire mixture**. Let's reconsider how the signals combine in a 1:1 mixture. The total number of protons for each compound is 14.\n\n**Re-evaluating Option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.**\n\n*   **Component 1 (1,2,4,5-TMB):** Aromatic: 1 singlet (2H). Alkyl: 1 singlet (12H).\n*   **Component 2 (1,2,3,4-TMB):** Aromatic: 1 singlet (2H). Alkyl: 2 singlets (6H each).\n\nLet's combine them in a 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Aromatic Spectrum:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives another 2H singlet. If these have different chemical shifts, we will see **two singlets**, each corresponding to 2H. This gives an **integral ratio of 1:1**. This perfectly matches the aromatic data.\n*   **Alkyl Spectrum:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets. This creates a total of **three singlets** with integrals in the ratio **12H : 6H : 6H**. This simplifies to a **2:1:1 ratio**. This perfectly matches the alkyl data.\n\nTherefore, the mixture consists of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula and Initial Information**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation (DoU) to understand the basic structure.\n    DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 10 + 1 - (14/2) = 11 - 7 = 4.\n*   A DoU of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring. All the given options are derivatives of benzene, which is consistent with this.\n*   The problem states there is a 1:1 mixture of two of these compounds.\n\n**2. Analyze the 1H NMR Data - Aromatic Region**\n\n*   **Signals:** Two singlets around 6.7 ppm.\n*   **Ratio:** 1:1.\n*   **Interpretation:** Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, a 1:1 signal ratio means that the number of protons creating the first singlet is equal to the number of protons creating the second singlet. Each compound must contribute one singlet in the aromatic region, and each of these singlets must correspond to the same number of protons.\n\nLet's predict the aromatic signals for each candidate compound:\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** This molecule is highly symmetrical. The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a single **singlet** corresponding to **2H**.\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry through C2 and C5. The protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a single **singlet** corresponding to **2H**.\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry between C2-C3 and C5-C6. The protons at C5 and C6 are equivalent. Although they are adjacent, chemically equivalent protons do not split each other in a first-order spectrum, so they appear as a single **singlet** corresponding to **2H**.\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. The four aromatic protons are all chemically equivalent and will appear as a single **singlet** corresponding to **4H**.\n\nA mixture of any of the tetramethylbenzene isomers (all 2H) with 1,4-diethylbenzene (4H) would give an aromatic signal ratio of 2:4 or 1:2. This contradicts the observed 1:1 ratio. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene is not present in the mixture**, which eliminates option **D**.\n\nThe mixture must contain two different tetramethylbenzene isomers. Any pair of them will have different chemical environments for their aromatic protons, leading to two distinct singlets. Since both singlets come from 2H, their integration ratio will be 1:1, matching the data.\n\n**3. Analyze the 1H NMR Data - Aliphatic Region**\n\n*   **Signals:** Three singlets around 2.2 ppm.\n*   **Ratio:** 2:1:1.\n*   **Interpretation:** The signals are from the methyl (-CH3) groups.\n    *   Each tetramethylbenzene isomer has 4 methyl groups, totaling 12 protons.\n    *   In a 1:1 mixture, there are 12 + 12 = 24 aliphatic protons in total.\n    *   The ratio is 2:1:1. The sum of the ratio parts is 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.\n    *   We can calculate the number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Signal 1 (ratio 2): (2/4) * 24H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n    *   So, the combination of the two isomers must produce three singlets with integrations corresponding to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\nLet's predict the aliphatic signals for each remaining candidate:\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene:** Due to its high symmetry, all four methyl groups are equivalent. It will show **one singlet for 12H**.\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:** Due to a plane of symmetry, there are two sets of equivalent methyl groups (the inner two and the outer two). It will show **two singlets, each for 6H**.\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** Due to a plane of symmetry, there are three sets of chemically different methyl groups. It will show **three singlets for 6H, 3H, and 3H**.\n\n**4. Identify the Correct Pair**\n\nNow we must find which pair of compounds, when mixed, gives the required set of signals {12H singlet, 6H singlet, 6H singlet}. We do this by combining the predicted signals from each compound in the pair.\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: one 12H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: two 6H singlets.\n    *   Combined signals: one 12H singlet, two 6H singlets.\n    *   This gives a total of three signals with an integration ratio of 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes: two 6H singlets.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined signals: three 6H singlets and two 3H singlets. This would give five signals (or fewer if there is accidental overlap), which does not match the \"three signals\" described.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: one 12H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined signals: one 12H singlet, one 6H singlet, and two 3H singlets. This would give four signals, not three.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only combination that produces an aliphatic spectrum with three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio is the mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nThe user wants me to identify a pair of aromatic compounds from a given list that, in a 1:1 mixture, would produce a specific 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n### 1.

Analyze the Candidate Compounds\n\nFirst, let's verify that all candidate compounds have the molecular formula C10H14.\n- Tetramethylbenzene: C6H2(CH3)4 = C6H2 + C4H12 = C10H14. Correct.\n- Diethylbenzene: C6H4(C2H5)2 = C6H4 + C4H10 = C10H14. Correct.\n\nNext, let's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each individual compound based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 are all chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry passing through the carbons at positions 2 and 5.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        *   The methyl groups at positions 1 and 3 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyl group at position 2 is unique (3H).\n        *   The methyl group at position 5 is unique (3H).\n        *   This will produce **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        *   The methyl groups at positions 1 and 4 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyl groups at positions 2 and 3 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   This will produce **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which simplifies to **1:1**.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four protons at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6 are all chemically equivalent. This will produce **one singlet** integrating to **4H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The methylene (CH2) protons will be a **quartet** (split by CH3) and the methyl (CH3) protons will be a **triplet** (split by CH2).\n    *   The problem states that all signals in the aliphatic region are singlets. Therefore, any option containing 1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated.\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Mixtures in Each Option\n\nNow, let's analyze the spectrum that would result from a 1:1 mixture of the compounds in each option.\n\n**A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n*   This option is incorrect because 1,4-diethylbenzene produces a quartet and a triplet, not singlets, in the aliphatic region.\n\n**B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   **Aromatic:** Prehnitene (2H singlet) + Isodurene (2H singlet). This gives two singlets with a 2H:2H or 1:1 integration ratio. This matches the data.\n*   **Aliphatic:** Prehnitene (two 6H singlets) + Isodurene (three singlets of 6H, 3H, 3H). This would result in up to five signals, not the three signals described. It cannot be combined to produce a 2:1:1 ratio. This contradicts the data.\n\n**C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   **Aromatic:** Durene (2H singlet) + Prehnitene (2H singlet). This gives two singlets with a 2H:2H or 1:1 integration ratio. **This matches the data.**\n*   **Aliphatic:** Durene (one 12H singlet) + Prehnitene (two 6H singlets). Assuming the chemical shifts are different, this mixture would produce exactly three singlets. The integrations would be 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This perfectly matches the data.**\n\n**D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   **Aromatic:** Durene (2H singlet) + Isodurene (2H singlet). This gives two singlets with a 2H:2H or 1:1 integration ratio. This matches the data.\n*   **Aliphatic:** Durene (one 12H singlet) + Isodurene (three singlets of 6H, 3H, 3H). This combination would result in four signals with integrations of 12H, 6H, 3H, and 3H (ratio 4:2:1:1). This contradicts the data.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe only pair of compounds that produces the described 1H NMR spectrum in a 1:1 mixture is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nThis problem requires a detailed analysis of the expected ¹H NMR spectra for several isomers of tetramethylbenzene and diethylbenzene to determine which two compounds are present in a 1:1 mixture.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Reasoning**\n\n**1. Analyze the Experimental NMR Data**\n\n*   **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar ratio of two C₁₀H₁₄ isomers.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals.\n    *   Both are singlets.\n    *   They have an integration ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals.\n    *   All are singlets.\n    *   They have an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\nThe most crucial piece of information is that **all signals are singlets**. This severely constrains the possible structures, as it implies that no protons are coupled to adjacent, non-equivalent protons.\n\n**2. Predict the ¹H NMR Spectra of the Candidate Compounds**\n\nLet's evaluate each option to see if it would produce only singlets.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule contains ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃). The protons of the -CH₂- group are adjacent to the three protons of the -CH₃ group and will be split into a quartet. The protons of the -CH₃ group will be split by the -CH₂- group into a triplet.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound would produce quartets and triplets, not just singlets. It can be **eliminated**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule has two aromatic protons at positions C5 and C6. These two protons are adjacent to each other. They will magnetically couple and split each other's signal, resulting in a pair of doublets (not singlets).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound would not produce singlets in the aromatic region. It can be **eliminated**.\n\nBy eliminating two of the four options, we can deduce that the mixture must contain the remaining two compounds: **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**. Now, we must verify that a 1:1 mixture of these two would produce the observed spectrum.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C3 and C6 are chemically equivalent and have no adjacent protons. They produce **one singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet** integrating to 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has a single plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent and have no adjacent protons. They produce **one singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct types of methyl groups:\n        1.  The two methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent: **one singlet (6H)**.\n        2.  The methyl group at C2 is unique: **one singlet (3H)**.\n        3.  The methyl group at C5 is unique: **one singlet (3H)**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Predicted Spectrum of the 1:1 Mixture**\n\nLet's combine the predicted spectra for a 1:1 molar mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB provides one 2H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB provides one 2H singlet.\n    *   Since these singlets come from different molecules, they will have slightly different chemical shifts. As the mixture is 1:1 and each signal represents 2H, their integration ratio will be 1:1.\n    *   This result (two singlets in a 1:1 ratio) **matches the experimental data perfectly.**\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB provides one singlet for 12H.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB provides three singlets for 6H, 3H, and 3H.\n    *   The problem states that only three signals are observed with a 2:1:1 ratio. This implies an accidental overlap of two signals.\n    *   Let's check the integrations. The signals available are with relative proton counts of 12, 6, 3, and 3.\n    *   To get three signals, the two 3H signals from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene must overlap to form a single peak with an integration of 6H.\n    *   The resulting signals would have integrations corresponding to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   The ratio of these signals is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   This result **matches the experimental data perfectly.**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nA 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene is the only combination that can account for all the features of the observed ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Experimental 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's break down the information given from the 1H NMR spectrum of the 1:1 mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are isomers with the formula C10H14. All four options fit this formula.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals, both are singlets, and their integration ratio is 1:1. This indicates two distinct types of aromatic protons in the mixture, and the total number of protons for each signal is equal.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all are singlets, and their integration ratio is 2:1:1. This indicates three distinct types of methyl group protons in the mixture. The signals must all be singlets, meaning no splitting from adjacent protons.\n\n**2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nWe need to analyze the structure and symmetry of each compound to predict the number of signals, their integration, and multiplicity.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are also chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **12H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has less symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. They will produce **two distinct singlets**, each with an integration of **1H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the two equivalent methyls at C1/C3 (6H), the methyl at C2 (3H), and the methyl at C5 (3H). This will produce **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two adjacent protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent methyls at C1/C4 (6H) and the equivalent methyls at C2/C3 (6H). This will produce **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, or **1:1**.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four protons on the ring are equivalent, producing **one singlet** with an integration of **4H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The signal for the CH2 groups will be a **quartet** (split by the CH3), and the signal for the CH3 groups will be a **triplet** (split by the CH2). The problem states all alkyl signals are singlets, so this compound can be eliminated immediately.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options by Combining the Spectra**\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **Eliminate Option A:** This option includes 1,4-diethylbenzene, which would show a quartet and a triplet in the alkyl region. The observed spectrum only has singlets. So, A is incorrect.\n\n*   **Eliminate Options B and C:** These options both include 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. This compound *by itself* produces two aromatic singlets. When mixed with another compound that also has aromatic protons (like 1,2,3,4-TMB or 1,2,4,5-TMB), the mixture would be expected to show at least three aromatic signals (unless there is an accidental overlap of signals, which is less likely). The problem explicitly states there are only two aromatic signals.\n\n*   **Evaluate Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet for 2H.\n        *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet for 2H.\n        *   A 1:1 mixture of these two will show **two singlets**. Since each signal corresponds to 2H, their integration ratio will be 2:2, or **1:1**. This is a perfect match with the experimental data.\n    *   **Alkyl Region:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet for 12H.\n        *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes two singlets, each for 6H.\n        *   A 1:1 mixture will therefore show **three singlets** in total (assuming they have different chemical shifts). The integrations will be 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio of these integrals is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is also a perfect match with the experimental data.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only option that perfectly explains the observed 1H NMR spectrum without requiring any assumptions of accidental signal overlap.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nTo determine the correct pair of compounds, we must analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each substance and see which 1:1 mixture matches the provided spectral data.\n\n**Given Spectral Data:**\n*   **Aromatic Region:** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio around 6.7 ppm.\n*   **Aliphatic Region:** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio around 2.2 ppm.\n*   All compounds have the molecular formula C10H14.\n\n**Analysis of Each Compound's Expected 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   Due to its high symmetry, all four methyl groups are chemically equivalent, producing a single sharp peak in the aliphatic region. This singlet integrates to 12 protons.\n    *   The two aromatic protons are also equivalent, resulting in one singlet in the aromatic region, integrating to 2 protons.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at positions 1 and 3 are equivalent (6H), the one at position 2 is unique (3H), and the one at position 5 is unique (3H). This results in three aliphatic singlets with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n    *   The two aromatic protons (at C4 and C6) are equivalent, producing one singlet (2H).\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 3 aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H; ratio 2:1:1).\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: the pair at positions 1 and 4 (6H) and the pair at positions 2 and 3 (6H). This gives two aliphatic singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   The two aromatic protons (at C5 and C6) are equivalent, giving one singlet (2H).\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 aliphatic singlets (6H, 6H; ratio 1:1).\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   The aliphatic portion consists of ethyl groups. These will not produce singlets but rather a quartet for the -CH2- protons and a triplet for the -CH3- protons due to spin-spin splitting. This immediately eliminates any option containing this compound.\n\n**Evaluating the 1:1 Mixture Options:**\n\nThe mixture contains two compounds, and in a 1:1 molar ratio, the total number of protons from each compound is equal. All tetramethylbenzene isomers have 14 protons (2 aromatic, 12 aliphatic).\n\n*   **Aromatic Signals:** The mixture shows two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. This is consistent with mixing any two of the tetramethylbenzene isomers, as each contributes one aromatic singlet of 2H intensity.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Signals:** The key to the solution lies here. The mixture has three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. In a 1:1 mixture, the total number of aliphatic protons is 12 + 12 = 24. A 2:1:1 ratio of 24 protons means the signals integrate to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\nLet's examine the options based on the aliphatic signals they would produce in a mixture:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** This mixture would have signals from a 12H singlet (from 1,2,4,5-TMB) and three separate signals of 6H, 3H, and 3H (from 1,2,3,5-TMB). This results in four aliphatic signals, which contradicts the data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** This mixture would exhibit signals of 6H, 6H (from 1,2,3,4-TMB) and 6H, 3H, 3H (from 1,2,3,5-TMB). Even with a potential overlap of the 6H signals, the resulting pattern (e.g., 12H, 6H, 3H, 3H) does not match the required 12H, 6H, 6H integration.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides **one aliphatic singlet of 12H**.\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene provides **two aliphatic singlets, each of 6H**.\n    *   When combined, these produce exactly three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** This option is incorrect because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\nTherefore, the mixture consists of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nTo determine which two compounds are in the mixture, we need to analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each option and compare it to the data provided.\n\n**Analysis of the Provided 1H NMR Data:**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, in a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, in a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n**Analysis of the Candidate Compounds:**\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** Due to its high symmetry, it will show:\n    *   **Aromatic:** One singlet for the two equivalent aromatic protons (at C3 and C6).\n    *   **Aliphatic:** One singlet for the four equivalent methyl groups (12 protons).\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has less symmetry. It will show:\n    *   **Aromatic:** Two singlets for the two non-equivalent aromatic protons (at C4 and C6).\n    *   **Aliphatic:** Three singlets for the three sets of non-equivalent methyl groups (C1/C3-methyls are equivalent, C2-methyl is unique, C5-methyl is unique), with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry. It will show:\n    *   **Aromatic:** One singlet for the two equivalent aromatic protons (at C5 and C6).\n    *   **Aliphatic:** Two singlets for the two sets of equivalent methyl groups (C1/C4-methyls are equivalent, C2/C3-methyls are equivalent), with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, or 1:1.\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has a molecular formula of C10H14 and high symmetry. It will show:\n    *   **Aromatic:** One singlet for the four equivalent aromatic protons.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** A quartet for the methylene (-CH2-) protons and a triplet for the methyl (-CH3) protons. The signals are not singlets, so this compound can be ruled out. This eliminates option D.\n\n**Evaluating the Mixture Options:**\n\nLet's consider a 1:1 mixture for the remaining options:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** This mixture would produce three signals in the aromatic region: one from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (2H) and two from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (1H each). The expected ratio would be 2:1:1. This does not match the observed 1:1 ratio of two singlets.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** This combination would also result in three aromatic signals: one from 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (2H) and two from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (1H each), giving a 2:1:1 ratio. This does not match the experimental data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this will result in **two singlets** with an equal integration, giving a **1:1 ratio**. This matches the description.\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one singlet (from 12 protons). 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene gives two singlets (each from 6 protons). In the 1:1 mixture, this results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to a **2:1:1 ratio**. This also perfectly matches the description.\n\nTherefore, the two compounds present in the mixture are 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n### **1. Analyze the given 1H NMR data**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** The compounds in the 1:1 mixture have the formula C10H14. All four options are isomers with this formula.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this indicates that each compound produces one singlet in the aromatic region. A singlet arises when a proton (or a set of equivalent protons) on the benzene ring has no adjacent protons.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. These signals represent the total methyl (or ethyl) protons from both compounds in the mixture.\n\n### **2. Predict the 1H NMR spectra for each of the candidate compounds**\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent and have no neighboring protons, so they will appear as a single singlet (2H).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce a single singlet (12H).\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:** One aromatic singlet (~6.9-7.0 ppm) and one alkyl singlet (~2.2-2.3 ppm).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** A plane of symmetry passes through the C2 and C5 positions. This makes the protons at C4 and C6 equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a single singlet (2H).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The same plane of symmetry makes the methyl groups at C1 and C3 equivalent (6H total). The methyl group at C2 (3H) is unique, and the methyl group at C5 (3H) is unique. This results in three separate singlets. The integration ratio of these alkyl singlets is 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:** One aromatic singlet (~6.7-6.8 ppm) and three alkyl singlets (~2.2-2.3 ppm) with a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are adjacent to each other. They would couple and split each other's signals, resulting in two doublets (an AX system), not a singlet.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound can be eliminated as it does not produce a singlet in the aromatic region.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four aromatic protons are chemically equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry and will produce a single singlet (4H).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The protons of the ethyl groups will not be singlets. The CH2 protons are adjacent to the CH3 protons, which would result in a quartet (for the CH2) and a triplet (for the CH3).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound can be eliminated because it produces a quartet and a triplet in the alkyl region, not singlets.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the options based on the mixture's spectrum**\n\nBased on the analysis, the two compounds must be chosen from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, as the other two options are inconsistent with the data.\n\nLet's consider a 1:1 mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet.\n    *   Assuming their chemical shifts are slightly different, the 1:1 mixture will show **two singlets of equal intensity (1:1 ratio)**. This perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region:**\n    *   This is the key part of the problem. The spectrum of the mixture shows three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n    *   The spectrum of pure 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene *by itself* produces three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   The spectrum of pure 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene has only one singlet for its 12 methyl protons.\n    *   If these two were mixed, we would expect four signals in the alkyl region (one from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and three from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene), unless there is an accidental overlap of signals.\n    *   There seems to be a misunderstanding of the question's phrasing. \"There are also three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio.\" This could describe the spectrum of *one* of the components, which is then mixed with another.\n\nLet's re-read the prompt carefully: \"The 1H NMR spectrum of a solution containing a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds...exhibits...three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio.\"\n\nThis implies that the *total* alkyl region of the mixture consists of these three signals. Let's reconsider the combination:\n\n*   **Mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. (Matches)\n    *   **Alkyl signals from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** 3 singlets (ratio 2:1:1).\n    *   **Alkyl signal from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene:** 1 singlet.\n    *   The total number of expected alkyl signals is four, not three.\n\nThere must be an overlap. Let's assume the single, large (12H) singlet from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene overlaps with the largest (6H) singlet from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n*   The combined signal would have an integration of 12H + 6H = 18H.\n*   The other two signals from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene would be 3H and 3H.\n*   The resulting ratio would be 18:3:3, which simplifies to 6:1:1. This does not match the observed 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the initial analysis. The most straightforward interpretation is that one of the compounds gives the 2:1:1 alkyl signal pattern, and the other compound's signals are somehow accounted for.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene** perfectly gives three alkyl singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** gives one alkyl singlet.\n\nWhat if the prompt is interpreted such that the total proton environment leads to this final ratio?\nLet the two compounds be A and B in a 1:1 molar ratio.\nThe total number of protons in compound A is 14. The total number in compound B is 14.\nThe aromatic protons are 2H from A and 2H from B, giving the 1:1 ratio.\nThe alkyl protons are 12H from A and 12H from B. Total alkyl protons = 24H.\nThe signals in the alkyl region are in a 2:1:1 ratio. The total parts in this ratio are 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.\nSo, the three signals correspond to:\n*   Signal 1: (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n*   Signal 2: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n*   Signal 3: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n\nNow let's see if we can form these integrals from a 1:1 mixture of two of our valid compounds.\n\n**Mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (one 12H singlet) and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (three singlets of 6H, 3H, 3H):**\n*   Signal A (1,2,4,5-): 12H\n*   Signals B (1,2,3,5-): 6H, 3H, 3H\n*   We need to combine these four signals to get three signals with integrals 12H, 6H, 6H.\n*   This is not possible without splitting a signal. For example, if the 12H signal from A is one of the final signals, we are left with 6H, 3H, 3H, which doesn't make two signals of 6H each. If the 6H from B is one of the final signals, we need to combine 12H, 3H, 3H to make signals of 12H and 6H. This is also not possible.\n\nThere appears to be a flaw in the reasoning or an ambiguity in the question's description. However, let's revisit the simplest interpretation.\n\nThe prompt describes the *overall* spectrum of the mixture.\n*   Aromatic: Two singlets (1:1). This points to two different compounds each having a single type of aromatic proton environment. Both 1,2,4,5- and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene fit this.\n*   Alkyl: Three singlets (2:1:1). The most direct way to get this pattern is if one of the components (1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene) provides exactly this pattern, and the other component's alkyl signal(s) coincidentally overlap with one of these.\n\nLet's assume the mixture is indeed **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**.\n*   **1,2,3,5-isomer** gives:\n    *   Aromatic: 1 singlet (2H) at ~6.7-6.8 ppm\n    *   Alkyl: 3 singlets (6H, 3H, 3H) -> Ratio 2:1:1\n*   **1,2,4,5-isomer** gives:\n    *   Aromatic: 1 singlet (2H) at ~6.9-7.0 ppm\n    *   Alkyl: 1 singlet (12H) at ~2.2-2.3 ppm\n\nThe description of the spectrum *exactly* matches the predicted spectrum of pure 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene *plus* an extra aromatic singlet from another compound. If we add 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, we get the required second aromatic singlet. But we also get a very large (12H) alkyl singlet which is unaccounted for in the \"three signals\" description.\n\nPerhaps the question is poorly posed, and it's intended to be simpler. Let's reconsider the options.\n*   A and D contain 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, which is incorrect.\n*   C contains 1,4-diethylbenzene, which is incorrect.\n*   This leaves only option B as a possibility.\n\nLet's assume option B is correct and try to rationalize the alkyl spectrum. For the mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**, the alkyl region contains:\n*   One 12H singlet from the 1,2,4,5- isomer.\n*   Three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H) from the 1,2,3,5- isomer.\n\nIf the problem states there are only three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio, there must be a coincidental overlap.\nThe only way to get a 2:1:1 ratio from these four signals is if the question is flawed. Let's ignore the integral ratios for a moment.\n*   Mixture of B: **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**. Both give one aromatic singlet, so the mixture gives two. This is correct. The mixture is expected to have four alkyl singlets. The problem states three. This is a contradiction.\n\nLet's re-read the prompt one more time. \"three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio.\" This is the description of the alkyl region of the final 1:1 mixture. As calculated before, a 1:1 mixture means we have 12H of alkyl protons from the first compound and 12H from the second, for a total of 24H. A 2:1:1 ratio of 24H gives signals integrating to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\nLet's see if we can generate these integrals from the pair in option B:\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** provides one 12H signal.\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene** provides one 6H signal, one 3H signal, and another 3H signal.\n*   Can we combine these (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H) to get three signals of (12H, 6H, 6H)?\n    *   Yes, if the two 3H signals from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene are not resolved or happen to have the same chemical shift as the 6H signal from the same molecule (unlikely) or if the two 3H signals from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene merge into a single 6H signal.\n    *   If the two 3H signals from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene merge (or are degenerate), we would have signals of 12H (from 1,2,4,5-), 6H (from 1,2,3,5-), and another 6H (from the combined 3H+3H signals of 1,2,3,5-). This gives three signals with a 12:6:6 ratio, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\nThis is the only chemically plausible explanation that fits the data. The two methyl groups at positions 2 and 5 in 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene are unique but could have very similar chemical shifts, leading to them appearing as a single signal integrating to 6H.\n\nTherefore, the two compounds are 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\nFinal check:\n1.  **Aromatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-isomer (1 singlet, 2H) + 1,2,3,5-isomer (1 singlet, 2H) -> Mixture has two singlets, 1:1 ratio. Correct.\n2.  **Alkyl signals:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-isomer provides a 12H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-isomer provides a 6H singlet (C1+C3 methyls) and two 3H singlets (C2 and C5 methyls).\n    *   Assume the two 3H singlets from the 1,2,3,5-isomer overlap to give one 6H signal.\n    *   The total signals for the mixture are: 12H singlet, 6H singlet, and another 6H singlet.\n    *   The integration ratio is 12:6:6, which is 2:1:1. Correct.\n\nThis confirms that the compounds are 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
