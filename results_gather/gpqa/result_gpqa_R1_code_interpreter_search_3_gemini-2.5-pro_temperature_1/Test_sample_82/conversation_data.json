    "This problem requires calculating the pH at two specific points during the titration of a diluted weak acid (acetic acid) with a strong base (NaOH).\n\n**1. Initial State after Dilution**\n\n*   First, we need to determine the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted.\n*   Initial moles of acetic acid (CH₃COOH):\n    *   Moles = Concentration × Volume = 0.05 mol/L × 0.0200 L = 0.0010 mol\n*   The initial volume is 20.00 cm³ (0.0200 L), and it's diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water.\n*   New total volume = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.0400 L.\n*   New concentration of acetic acid (Ca):\n    *   Concentration = Moles / New Volume = 0.0010 mol / 0.0400 L = 0.025 M.\n\n**2. pH at 25% Titration**\n\n*   The titration reaction is: CH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COONa + H₂O.\n*   At 25% titration, 25% of the initial acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH, forming its conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). This creates a buffer solution.\n*   The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used to calculate the pH of a buffer solution:\n    pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n    where:\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka)\n    *   [A⁻] is the concentration of the conjugate base (acetate, CH₃COO⁻)\n    *   [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid (acetic acid, CH₃COOH)\n*   Calculate pKa:\n    *   pKa = -log(1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n*   At 25% titration, the ratio of the moles of the conjugate base formed to the moles of the weak acid remaining is 25% to 75% (or 1 to 3). Since they are in the same volume, the ratio of their concentrations is the same as the ratio of their moles.\n    *   [A⁻]/[HA] = 0.25 / 0.75 = 1/3\n*   Now, calculate the pH:\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log(1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.73 - log(3)\n    *   pH = 4.73 - 0.477\n    *   pH ≈ 4.26\n\n**3. pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n*   The equivalence point is reached when the moles of added NaOH equal the initial moles of acetic acid (0.0010 mol).\n*   At this point, all the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The solution contains 0.0010 mol of CH₃COONa.\n*   The acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) hydrolyzes in water, acting as a weak base:\n    CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n*   We need to find the concentration of the acetate ion first. To do this, we need the total volume of the solution.\n    *   Volume of NaOH added = Moles / Concentration = 0.0010 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³.\n    *   Total volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH added = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L.\n    *   Concentration of acetate [A⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.0010 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M.\n*   Now, we calculate the pOH from the hydrolysis reaction. We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for the acetate ion.\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰\n*   Set up the equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis:\n    *   Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    *   Let [OH⁻] = x. Then [CH₃COOH] = x, and [CH₃COO⁻] = 0.02 - x.\n    *   5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰ = x² / (0.02 - x)\n*   Since Kb is very small, we can assume that x is negligible compared to 0.02, so (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n    *   5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰ ≈ x² / 0.02\n    *   x² ≈ (5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 ≈ 1.082 × 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] ≈ √(1.082 × 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 × 10⁻⁶ M\n*   Calculate pOH:\n    *   pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.29 × 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n*   Calculate pH:\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated pH at 25% titration is 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is 8.52.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\n\n# --- pH at 25% titration ---\n# Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n# At 25% titration, the ratio [A-]/[HA] is 0.25/0.75 = 1/3.\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\npH_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\n# --- pH at the equivalence point ---\n# Initial moles of acid\nmoles_acid = 0.05 * 0.020  # 0.001 mol\n\n# Volume of NaOH added to reach equivalence\nvolume_NaOH_eq = moles_acid / 0.1  # 0.01 L or 10 cm3\n\n# Total volume at equivalence\nvolume_total_eq = 0.040 + volume_NaOH_eq  # 0.050 L or 50 cm3\n\n# Concentration of the conjugate base (acetate) at equivalence\nconc_acetate = moles_acid / volume_total_eq  # 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n\n# Kb for acetate\nKb = Kw / Ka\n\n# [OH-]^2 = Kb * [acetate]\nOH_conc_squared = Kb * conc_acetate\nOH_conc = math.sqrt(OH_conc_squared)\n\n# pOH and pH\npOH_eq = -math.log10(OH_conc)\npH_eq = 14 - pOH_eq\n\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_eq:.2f}\")\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
