    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or pi bonds in the molecule.\n    *   The formula for DoU is: C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   Plugging in the values: DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: one ring and three double bonds) plus one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** These two distinct, medium-to-strong bands are characteristic of the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂). A secondary amine (-NHR) would typically show only one band in this region.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl region. This frequency is typical for the C=O stretch of an ester. An amide C=O stretch usually appears at a lower frequency (around 1650-1690 cm⁻¹).\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Multiplicity (t, triplet):** The signal is split into a triplet, meaning it has 2 adjacent protons (n+1=3, so n=2). This suggests a -CH₂-CH₃ fragment.\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Represents a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Multiplicity (q, quartet):** The signal is split into a quartet, meaning it has 3 adjacent protons (n+1=4, so n=3). This confirms the -CH₂-CH₃ (ethyl) group.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a very downfield shift for a CH₂ group, indicating it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom in an ester (R-COO-CH₂-).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Represents two protons.\n    *   **Multiplicity (bs, broad singlet):** A broad signal for 2H in this region is characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). The broadness is due to chemical exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0-8.0 ppm):** These signals are in the aromatic region, confirming the presence of a benzene ring.\n    *   **Pattern (two doublets, each 2H):** This specific pattern is the hallmark of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two substituents are different, causing the chemically equivalent protons on each side of the ring to split each other into doublets.\n    *   The protons at 7.0 ppm are upfield, suggesting they are adjacent to an electron-donating group (like -NH₂). The protons at 8.0 ppm are downfield, suggesting they are adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (like an ester, -COOR).\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   We have a **1,4-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n*   One substituent is a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**.\n*   The other substituent is an **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group**.\n\nPutting these pieces together gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n**5. Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR (two N-H bands) and would have a different NMR spectrum (e.g., a formyl proton signal).\n*   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a primary amide (contradicts C=O at 1720 cm⁻¹) and is meta-substituted (contradicts the para-splitting pattern in NMR).\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** **Correct.** This structure perfectly matches all the data: the formula, the DoU, the primary amine and ester groups in the IR, and the ethyl group, para-substituted ring, and amine signals in the NMR.\n*   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. This is an ester, but the ethyl group would be part of a propionyl group (-CO-CH₂CH₃). The NMR for the CH₂ group would be a quartet around 2.3-2.6 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe data provided conclusively identifies the compound as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for calculating the degree of unsaturation is `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)`.\n*   Plugging in the values from the molecular formula: `DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5`.\n*   A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees: one ring and three π-bonds) plus one additional π-bond, typically from a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct medium-to-strong bands in this region is a classic signature for the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. A secondary amine would typically show only a single band.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong band is characteristic of a **carbonyl (C=O) stretch**. The frequency is too high for a typical amide (which is usually < 1700 cm⁻¹) and fits perfectly within the range for an **ester** (typically 1750-1715 cm⁻¹).\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's break down the signals piece by piece:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents a methyl group (-CH₃) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-), as indicated by the triplet (t) splitting (n+1=3, so n=2). This is the `-CH₃` part of an ethyl group.\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal represents a methylene group (-CH₂-) that is adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃), as indicated by the quartet (q) splitting (n+1=4, so n=3). This confirms the presence of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The very downfield chemical shift (4.5 ppm) indicates this methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester (`-COO-CH₂-`).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) for two protons in this region is characteristic of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. The broadening is due to proton exchange and coupling with the nitrogen atom. This confirms the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region, confirming the benzene ring. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The protons at 7.0 ppm are upfield, meaning they are adjacent to the electron-donating amine group. The protons at 8.0 ppm are downfield, adjacent to the electron-withdrawing ester group.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n\nBased on the combined evidence:\n*   We have a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n*   One substituent is a **primary amine (-NH₂)**.\n*   The other substituent is an **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\nPutting these pieces together, the only possible structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n**5. Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, inconsistent with the IR and NMR data for a primary amine.\n*   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is a primary amide, which is inconsistent with the ester C=O stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹. It is also meta-substituted, which doesn't match the para-splitting pattern in the NMR.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectroscopic data: the primary amine, the ethyl ester, and the para-substituted benzene ring.\n*   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This is an ester, but the ethyl group is attached to the carbonyl carbon (`-OOC-CH₂CH₃`). The NMR signal for the `-CH₂-` in the propionate group would be a quartet around 2.2-2.5 ppm, not at 4.5 ppm.\n\nTherefore, the correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>",

Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n\n*   **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU indicates the number of rings and/or pi bonds in the molecule.\n    *   The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   Plugging in the values: DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is highly characteristic of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: one ring and three double bonds) plus one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region (3500-3300 cm⁻¹) is the classic signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**. These two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl region. This frequency is characteristic of the C=O stretch of an **ester**, particularly one conjugated with an aromatic ring. It is too high for a typical amide C=O stretch, which usually appears below 1700 cm⁻¹.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal corresponds to a methyl group (-CH₃). The triplet (t) splitting means it is adjacent to a group with two protons (n+1=3, so n=2), which is typically a methylene (-CH₂-) group. This suggests a -CH₂-CH₃ fragment.\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a methylene group (-CH₂-). The quartet (q) splitting means it is adjacent to a group with three protons (n+1=4, so n=3), confirming the -CH₂-CH₃ (ethyl) fragment. The very downfield chemical shift (~4.5 ppm) indicates this methylene group is bonded to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester (-COO-**CH₂**-).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) for two protons in this region is characteristic of the protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**, which confirms the IR data. The broadness is due to chemical exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region, confirming the presence of the benzene ring. This specific pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The protons at 7.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-donating amine group, while the protons at 8.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-withdrawing ester group.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure and Conclusion**\n\n*   From the DoU and NMR, we have a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n*   From the IR and NMR, one substituent is a **primary amine (-NH₂)**.\n*   From the IR and NMR, the other substituent is an **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\nPutting these pieces together, the only structure that fits all the data is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. Let's check this against the options:\n*   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide.\n*   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Correct. This structure perfectly matches all spectroscopic data.\n*   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. The ethyl group is on the wrong side of the ester linkage, which would lead to a very different NMR spectrum for the CH₂ group (it would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm).\n\n<<<C>>>",

    "Here's a detailed breakdown of the reasoning process to identify the compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula**\n\n*   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** This calculation helps determine the number of rings and pi (π) bonds.\n    *   The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   Plugging in the values: DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees: 1 ring + 3 π-bonds) plus one additional π-bond, most likely from a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct bands in this region is the classic signature for the N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. A secondary amine (-NHR) would typically show only a single band.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption band in the carbonyl region. Its frequency is characteristic of a conjugated **ester** (typically 1730-1715 cm⁻¹). This frequency is too high to be an amide, which usually appears at a lower frequency (<1700 cm⁻¹).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's interpret each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents a methyl group (-CH₃). The triplet (t) splitting indicates it is adjacent to a methylene (-CH₂-) group (since n+1=3, n=2). This is the start of an ethyl group.\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal is a methylene group (-CH₂-). The quartet (q) splitting confirms it is adjacent to a methyl group (since n+1=4, n=3). The very downfield chemical shift (~4.5 ppm) is characteristic of a methylene group attached to the oxygen of an ester (-COO-**CH₂**-). This confirms the presence of an **ethyl ester** fragment (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) for two protons in this region is characteristic of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**. The broadness is due to chemical exchange and the quadrupolar nature of the nitrogen atom. This confirms the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region, confirming the benzene ring. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The protons at 7.0 ppm are shielded (upfield) because they are adjacent to the electron-donating amine group. The protons at 8.0 ppm are deshielded (downfield) because they are adjacent to the electron-withdrawing ester group.\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the Structure and Evaluate Options**\n\nBased on the combined evidence:\n*   We have a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n*   One substituent is a **primary amine (-NH₂)**.\n*   The other substituent is an **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\nPutting these pieces together leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nNow let's check the given options:\n*   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, not a primary amine and an ester.\n*   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide, inconsistent with both the IR and NMR data.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Correct. This structure perfectly matches all the spectroscopic data.\n*   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. In this structure, the ethyl group would be part of the propionate group (-OCOCH₂CH₃). The NMR signal for that CH₂ group would be a quartet around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n\n<<<C>>>"
