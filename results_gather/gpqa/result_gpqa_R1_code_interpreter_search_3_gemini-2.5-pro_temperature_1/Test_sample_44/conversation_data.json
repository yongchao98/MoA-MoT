    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the System and Energy Levels**\n\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Since they are spin-1/2, they are fermions.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** As fermions, these particles must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. For a particle in a box, a quantum state is defined by its principal quantum number `n` and its spin quantum number `m_s`.\n*   **Quantum States:**\n    *   The principal quantum number `n` can be any positive integer (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n    *   The spin quantum number `m_s` can be either +1/2 (spin up, ↑) or -1/2 (spin down, ↓).\n    *   Therefore, for each energy level `n`, there are two possible spin states. This means each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two fermions (one with spin up and one with spin down).\n*   **Single-Particle Energy:** The energy of a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L is given by:\n    E_n = n² * (π²ħ² / 2mL²)\n    The problem defines the base energy unit as E = (π²ħ² / 2mL²).\n    So, the energy of a particle in the nth level is simply:\n    E_n = n²E\n\n**2. Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_ground)**\n\nThe ground state is the state with the lowest possible total energy. To find this, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   **Level n=1 (Energy E₁ = 1²E = E):** We can place the first two particles in this level (one spin up, one spin down).\n*   **Level n=2 (Energy E₂ = 2²E = 4E):** We place the remaining two particles in this level (one spin up, one spin down).\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\nE_ground = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₂)\nE_ground = (2 × E) + (2 × 4E)\nE_ground = 2E + 8E\n**E_ground = 10E**\n\n**3. Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_first)**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the next lowest possible energy. We can find this by taking the ground state configuration and promoting one particle to the lowest available energy level.\n\n*   **Ground State Configuration:** Two particles in n=1, two particles in n=2.\n*   **Excitation:** We promote one particle from the highest occupied level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied level (n=3).\n*   **First Excited State Configuration:**\n    *   Two particles in n=1 (Energy E₁)\n    *   One particle in n=2 (Energy E₂)\n    *   One particle in n=3 (Energy E₃ = 3²E = 9E)\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\nE_first = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃)\nE_first = (2 × E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 9E)\nE_first = 2E + 4E + 9E\n**E_first = 15E**\n\n**4. Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_second)**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy after the first excited state. We need to consider all possible excitations from the ground state and find the one with the second-lowest energy increase.\n\nLet's list the possible low-energy configurations and their total energies:\n*   **Ground State:** (2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=2). Energy = 10E.\n*   **First Excitation:** (2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3). Energy = 15E. (This is the first excited state).\n\nNow let's find other possible excitations and their energies:\n*   **Possibility A:** Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3 (from ground state).\n    *   Configuration: (1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3).\n    *   Energy = (1 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (1 × E) + (2 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n*   **Possibility B:** Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3 (from ground state).\n    *   Configuration: (2 in n=1, 2 in n=3).\n    *   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₃) = (2 × E) + (2 × 9E) = 2E + 18E = **20E**.\n*   **Possibility C:** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4 (from ground state).\n    *   Configuration: (2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4).\n    *   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₄) = (2 × E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = **22E**.\n\nComparing the energies of the excited states we've found (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E...), the lowest is 15E (the first excited state), and the next lowest is 18E.\n\nTherefore, the energy of the second excited state is:\n**E_second = 18E**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe energies of the three lowest states are:\n*   Ground State: 10E\n*   First Excited State: 15E\n*   Second Excited State: 18E\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This problem involves determining the energy states of a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Since spin-1/2 particles are fermions, they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n**1. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nThe energy of a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L is given by the formula:\nE_n = n² * (π²ħ² / 2mL²)\n\nThe problem defines the base energy unit as E = (π²ħ² / 2mL²). Therefore, the energy of a particle in the nth quantum level is:\nE_n = n²E\n\nThe first few energy levels are:\n*   n = 1: E₁ = 1²E = E\n*   n = 2: E₂ = 2²E = 4E\n*   n = 3: E₃ = 3²E = 9E\n*   n = 4: E₄ = 4²E = 16E\n*   ...and so on.\n\n**2. Applying the Pauli Exclusion Principle**\n\nThe Pauli Exclusion Principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. For an electron in a box, a state is defined by its principal quantum number (n) and its spin (up or down). This means each energy level 'n' can hold a maximum of two particles, one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n**3. Calculating the Ground State Energy (E_ground)**\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the energy levels from the lowest energy upwards, placing two particles in each level until all four particles are placed.\n\n*   **n = 1 level:** Place the first two particles. Their combined energy is 2 * E₁ = 2E.\n*   **n = 2 level:** Place the next two particles. Their combined energy is 2 * E₂ = 2 * (4E) = 8E.\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\nE_ground = (2 * E₁) + (2 * E₂) = 2E + 8E = **10E**.\n\n**4. Calculating the First Excited State Energy (E_first)**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. This is achieved by moving one particle from the highest occupied level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied level (n=3).\n\n*   The new configuration is:\n    *   **n = 1 level:** 2 particles (Energy: 2 * E₁ = 2E)\n    *   **n = 2 level:** 1 particle (Energy: 1 * E₂ = 4E)\n    *   **n = 3 level:** 1 particle (Energy: 1 * E₃ = 9E)\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\nE_first = (2 * E₁) + (1 * E₂) + (1 * E₃) = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**.\n\n**5. Calculating the Second Excited State Energy (E_second)**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We need to consider the possible excitations from the ground state and find the one with the second-lowest energy increase.\n\n*   **First Excitation (from step 4):** Move one particle from n=2 to n=3. Energy increases by E₃ - E₂ = 9E - 4E = 5E. Total energy is 10E + 5E = 15E.\n*   **Second lowest energy excitation:** Let's consider moving one particle from a lower level, n=1, to the lowest unoccupied level, n=3.\n    *   The new configuration is:\n        *   **n = 1 level:** 1 particle (Energy: 1 * E₁ = E)\n        *   **n = 2 level:** 2 particles (Energy: 2 * E₂ = 8E)\n        *   **n = 3 level:** 1 particle (Energy: 1 * E₃ = 9E)\n    *   The total energy of this state is:\n        E_second = (1 * E₁) + (2 * E₂) + (1 * E₃) = E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n\nLet's check other possibilities to confirm this is the second excited state:\n*   Moving one particle from n=2 to n=4: Total Energy = (2*E₁) + (1*E₂) + (1*E₄) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n*   Moving two particles from n=2 to n=3: Total Energy = (2*E₁) + (2*E₃) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n\nComparing the excited state energies (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E...), the lowest is 15E (first excited state), and the next lowest is 18E (second excited state).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*   Ground State Energy = 10E\n*   First Excited State Energy = 15E\n*   Second Excited State Energy = 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
