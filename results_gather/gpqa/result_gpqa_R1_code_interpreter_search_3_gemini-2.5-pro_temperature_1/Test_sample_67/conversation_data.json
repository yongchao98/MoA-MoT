    "This is a classic problem in quantum mechanics involving spin dynamics, specifically Larmor precession.\n\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:**\n    *   The particle is spin-1/2.\n    *   Initially, there's a magnetic field **B₀** = B **k̂** (in the +Z direction).\n    *   The particle's magnetic moment **μ** is \"aligned\" with this field. This means the particle is in the energy eigenstate corresponding to the spin pointing in the direction of the field.

So, S_z |+z> = (ħ/2) |+z>.\n\n2.  **Identify the New Hamiltonian:**\n    *   At t=0, the magnetic field is suddenly switched to **B** = B **ĵ** (in the +Y direction).\n    *   The Hamiltonian of the system describes the energy of interaction between the magnetic moment and the magnetic field: H = -**μ** ⋅ **B**.\n    *   Given **μ** = γ**S** (where **S** is the spin angular momentum vector), the new Hamiltonian for t > 0 is H = - (γ**S**) ⋅ (B **ĵ**) = -γB S_y.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution of the State:**\n    *   The state of the system for t > 0 evolves according to the Schrödinger equation, governed by the new Hamiltonian H.\n    *   The state at time t is given by |ψ(t)> = U(t) |ψ(0)>, where U(t) = exp(-iHt/ħ) is the time evolution operator.\n    *   Substituting the Hamiltonian, we get:\n        |ψ(t)> = exp(-i(-γB S_y)t / ħ) |+z>\n        |ψ(t)> = exp(i γB t S_y / ħ) |+z>\n    *   Let's define the Larmor frequency ω = γB. The expression simplifies to:\n        |ψ(t)> = exp(i ω t S_y / ħ) |+z>\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value:**\n    *   We need to find the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, <μ_z(t)>.\n    *   <μ_z(t)> = <ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)>.\n    *   Since μ_z = γS_z, this is equivalent to finding <μ_z(t)> = γ <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>.

The equation of motion for an operator A is: d**A**/dt = (i/ħ) [H, **A**].\n    *   Let's find the equation of motion for S_z:\n        d(S_z)/dt = (i/ħ) [H, S_z] = (i/ħ) [-γB S_y, S_z] = (-iγB/ħ) [S_y, S_z]\n    *   Using the fundamental commutation relation for spin operators, [S_y, S_z] = iħ S_x, we get:\n        d(S_z)/dt = (-iγB/ħ) (iħ S_x) = γB S_x\n    *   Now we need an equation for S_x.\n        d(S_x)/dt = (i/ħ) [H, S_x] = (-iγB/ħ) [S_y, S_x]\n    *   Using the commutation relation [S_y, S_x] = -iħ S_z, we get:\n        d(S_x)/dt = (-iγB/ħ) (-iħ S_z) = -γB S_z\n    *   We now have a system of two coupled differential equations:\n        1. d<S_z>/dt = γB <S_x>\n        2. d<S_x>/dt = -γB <S_z>\n    *   Differentiating the first equation with respect to time gives:\n        d²<S_z>/dt² = γB d<S_x>/dt\n    *   Substituting the second equation into this one:\n        d²<S_z>/dt² = γB (-γB <S_z>) = -(γB)² <S_z>\n    *   This is the standard equation for a simple harmonic oscillator, d²x/dt² = -Ω²x, where Ω is the angular frequency of oscillation.\n    *   By comparing the two equations, we can directly identify the angular oscillation frequency Ω.\n\n6.  **Determine the Oscillation Frequency:**\n    *   Comparing our derived equation, d²<S_z>/dt² = -(γB)² <S_z>, with the standard harmonic oscillator equation, we see that the angular frequency of oscillation is:\n        Ω = γB\n    *   The expectation value <μ_z(t)> = γ<S_z(t)> will therefore oscillate with this same frequency. The solution for <S_z(t)> is of the form A cos(γBt + φ), and so <μ_z(t)> will also oscillate with angular frequency γB.\n\nThe question asks for the oscillation frequency, which corresponds to the angular frequency Ω we have just calculated.\n\nFinal Answer: The oscillation frequency is γB.\n\n<<<A>>>",
