    "*   **Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\n    1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction involves a ketone (butan-2-one) reacting with a cyanide source (NaCN) to form a product with both a hydroxyl (-OH) and a nitrile (-CN) group on the same carbon. This is a classic **cyanohydrin formation** reaction.\n    2.  **Analyze the mechanism:** The reaction proceeds via the nucleophilic addition of the cyanide ion (CN⁻) to the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of the ketone.\n        *   CH₃C(=O)CH₂CH₃ + CN⁻ → CH₃C(O⁻)(CN)CH₂CH₃ (alkoxide intermediate)\n    3.  **Determine the role of reagent A:** The alkoxide intermediate formed needs to be protonated to yield the final hydroxyl group. Therefore, a source of protons (H⁺) is required.\n        *   CH₃C(O⁻)(CN)CH₂CH₃ + H⁺ → CH₃C(OH)(CN)CH₂CH₃ (2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile)\n    4.  **Evaluate the options for A:**\n        *   **NaHSO₃ (Sodium bisulfite):** This reagent is used for forming bisulfite addition products with aldehydes and some ketones, which is a different reaction. It is not an acid source for this purpose.\n        *   **H₃O⁺ (Hydronium ion):** This represents an acidic aqueous solution (e.g., dilute HCl or H₂SO₄). It is an excellent source of H⁺ to protonate the intermediate. It also helps to generate small amounts of HCN in situ from NaCN, which is the active nucleophile. Therefore, **A = H₃O⁺** is a suitable reagent.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\n    1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction shows the conversion of a nitrile group (-CN) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), while the rest of the molecule (the α-hydroxy group and the aromatic part) remains unchanged. This is the **hydrolysis of a nitrile**.\n    2.  **Analyze the mechanism:** Nitrile hydrolysis requires water (H₂O) and is catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base. The reaction proceeds through an amide intermediate.\n        *   R-CN + H₂O --(catalyst)--> R-C(=O)NH₂ (amide) --(H₂O, catalyst)--> R-COOH (carboxylic acid) + NH₃\n    3.  **Determine the role of reagent B:** Reagent B acts as the catalyst for the hydrolysis in the presence of water.\n    4.  **Evaluate the options for B:**\n        *   **HCl (Hydrochloric acid):** This is a strong mineral acid and is a very common and effective catalyst for the complete hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.\n        *   **CH₃COOH (Acetic acid):** This is a weak acid. While it might be able to catalyze the reaction to some extent, it is generally much less effective and slower than a strong acid like HCl. Strong acids are preferred for this transformation. Therefore, **B = HCl** is the most suitable reagent.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n\n    *   For the first reaction, the reagent **A** is **H₃O⁺**.\n    *   For the second reaction, the reagent **B** is **HCl**.\n\n    Matching these with the given options:\n    A) A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl\n    B) A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl\n    C) A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH\n    D) A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH\n\n    The correct choice is option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "*   **Analysis of the First Reaction:**\n    *   **Reaction:** butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n    *   **Reactants:** Butan-2-one is a ketone (CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃). NaCN is a source of the cyanide nucleophile (CN⁻).\n    *   **Product:** 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile is a cyanohydrin. It has both a hydroxyl (-OH) group and a nitrile (-CN) group attached to the same carbon that was originally the carbonyl carbon.\n    *   **Mechanism:** This is a nucleophilic addition reaction.\n        1.  The cyanide ion (CN⁻) attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one, breaking the C=O pi bond and forming an alkoxide intermediate: CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃.\n        2.  This negatively charged alkoxide intermediate needs to be protonated to form the final stable hydroxyl group. Therefore, reagent **A** must be a source of protons (H⁺).\n    *   **Evaluating options for A:**\n        *   `NaHSO₃` (Sodium bisulfite) is a salt used in bisulfite addition reactions, not as a proton source for this step.\n        *   `H₃O⁺` (Hydronium ion) represents an acidic aqueous solution (e.g., dilute HCl or H₂SO₄). It is the standard reagent used to provide the necessary protons to complete the cyanohydrin formation.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** Reagent **A** is **H₃O⁺**. This narrows the possible answers to B and C.\n\n*   **Analysis of the Second Reaction:**\n    *   **Reaction:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid\n    *   **Transformation:** The nitrile group (-C≡N) is converted into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This is a hydrolysis reaction.\n    *   **Mechanism:** The hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid requires water and is catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base. The reaction proceeds in two steps: first to an amide, and then the amide is further hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid. To ensure the reaction goes to completion, a strong catalyst is typically used.\n    *   **Evaluating options for B (from the remaining choices):**\n        *   `HCl` (Hydrochloric acid) is a strong mineral acid and is a very common and effective catalyst for the complete hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.\n        *   `CH₃COOH` (Acetic acid) is a weak acid. While it can catalyze the reaction, it is much less efficient than a strong acid like HCl and may not drive the reaction to completion.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The most suitable reagent **B** for this transformation is the strong acid, **HCl**.\n\n*   **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   Reagent A is H₃O⁺.\n    *   Reagent B is HCl.\n    *   This combination matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",

We must choose between the remaining options for B, which are `HCl` and `CH₃COOH`.\n    *   `HCl` (hydrochloric acid) is a strong mineral acid. It is a very effective and commonly used catalyst to promote the complete hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.\n    *   `CH₃COOH` (acetic acid) is a weak acid. While it could potentially catalyze the reaction, it is much less effective than a strong acid, and the reaction would be very slow or might not go to completion. For a full conversion as implied by the reaction scheme, a strong acid is the appropriate choice.\n    *   Therefore, **B = HCl**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Reagent **A** is **H₃O⁺**.\n*   Reagent **B** is **HCl**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
