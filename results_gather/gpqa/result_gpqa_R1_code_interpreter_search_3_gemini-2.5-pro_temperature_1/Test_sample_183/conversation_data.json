    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\nLet's break down its structure and the relationship between the substituents:\n*   An ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3) at C1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3) at C2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at C3.\n\nThe substituents are arranged vicinally (on adjacent carbons 1, 2, and 3).\nThe directing effects of these groups in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) are:\n*   **Ethoxy (-OEt):** Strong activator, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **tert-Butyl (-tBu):** Weak activator, ortho-, para-director. Very bulky, so it strongly favors para substitution.\n*   **Nitro (-NO2):** Strong deactivator, meta-director.\n\n**2. Retrosynthetic Analysis (Working Backwards)**\n\nA common strategy to synthesize ethers like this is the Williamson ether synthesis.\n*   **Final Step:** The ethoxy group can be introduced by reacting the corresponding phenol with an ethylating agent.\n    *   Precursor: 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol.\n    *   Reaction: NaOH (to deprotonate the phenol) followed by ethyl bromide (EtBr). This matches step `ix) NaOH/EtBr` in option A, and `vii) NaOH/EtBr` in options B and C.\n\n*   **Step before last:** How to make 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol? The hydroxyl group (-OH) is a strong ortho-, para-director. Introducing the nitro group onto 2-tert-butylphenol would result in nitration at the C4 and C6 positions, not the desired C3 position. Therefore, the -OH group must be introduced from a different precursor, typically an amino group (-NH2) via a Sandmeyer reaction (diazotization followed by hydrolysis).\n    *   Precursor: 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline.\n    *   Reactions: `NaNO2/HCl` to form the diazonium salt, followed by `H3O+, H2O/Heat` to hydrolyze it to the phenol.\n\n*   **Key Intermediate:** The core of the synthesis is to prepare 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline. Let's analyze its structure (aniline numbering: NH2 at C1, tBu at C2, NO2 at C3).\n    *   This intermediate can be formed by the nitration of o-tert-butylaniline (2-tert-butylaniline). In the strongly acidic nitrating mixture (HNO3/H2SO4), the amino group is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH3+).\n    *   The -NH3+ group is a strong deactivator and a **meta-director**. It will direct the incoming -NO2 group to positions C3 and C5.\n    *   The -tBu group is a weak activator and an **ortho-, para-director**. It activates positions C4 and C6.\n    *   The strong deactivating effect of -NH3+ at its ortho/para positions (C4, C6) disfavors substitution there.\n    *   Between the meta positions (C3 and C5), C3 is ortho to the activating -tBu group, while C5 is meta to it. Therefore, nitration is directed preferentially to C3. This step is viable for producing the desired isomer.\n\n*   **Synthesizing o-tert-butylaniline:** This can be made from o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene by reduction of the nitro group.\n    *   Precursor: o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene.\n    *   Reaction: `Fe/HCl` (a standard method for nitro group reduction).\n\n*   **Synthesizing o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene:** This is typically made by the nitration of tert-butylbenzene.\n    *   Precursor: tert-butylbenzene.\n    *   Reaction: `HNO3/H2SO4`. This Friedel-Crafts alkylation followed by nitration presents a problem. The bulky tert-butyl group is an ortho-, para-director, but it sterically hinders the ortho positions, leading to the para-isomer (p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene) as the major product. The yield of the required ortho-isomer is low. This contradicts the \"high-yield\" specification in the question.\n\n*   **Alternative High-Yield route to o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene:** A common strategy to overcome the low ortho yield is to use a removable blocking group.\n    1.  Start with tert-butylbenzene.\n    2.  Sulfonate it (`SO3/H2SO4`). The bulky sulfonic acid group will go almost exclusively to the para position, blocking it. This gives p-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n    3.  Nitrate this intermediate (`HNO3/H2SO4`). The -tBu group (o,p-director) and the -SO3H group (m-director) both direct the incoming nitro group to the positions ortho to the t-butyl group (C2 and C6). This is a highly regioselective reaction.\n    4.  Remove the sulfonic acid blocking group by heating with dilute acid (`dilute H2SO4`). This leaves o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene in high yield.\n\n    This established a logical, high-yield synthetic path. However, none of the options list the steps in this correct order. This suggests there might be a flaw in the question or options. Let's evaluate the given options based on chemical feasibility.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\n*   **Option A:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...\n    *   This sequence starts with nitration of benzene, then reduction to aniline. Step (iii) is the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring. So, A is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...\n    *   This sequence attempts to perform a diazotization reaction (iv) on o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene (the product of steps i and ii). Diazotization requires an amino group, not a nitro group. So, C is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option D:** i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...\n    *   Steps (i), (ii), and (iii) correctly describe the start of the high-yield synthesis using a blocking group, forming 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid. However, this intermediate has a 1,2,4-substitution pattern, which cannot lead to the 1,2,3-substituted final product using the subsequent steps. Furthermore, step (vi), the nitration of a diazonium salt, is not a standard or feasible reaction. So, D is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4\n    *   Let's analyze this sequence step-by-step:\n        *   i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene -> tert-butylbenzene. (OK)\n        *   ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: tert-butylbenzene -> o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. (This step gives a low yield of the required ortho isomer, but it is chemically possible).\n        *   iii) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction -> o-tert-butylaniline. (OK)\n        *   iv) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration -> 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline. (As analyzed, this is a viable reaction).\n        *   v) `NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization -> diazonium salt. (OK)\n        *   vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`: Hydrolysis -> 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol. (OK)\n        *   vii) `NaOH/EtBr`: Williamson ether synthesis -> **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Product is formed).\n    *   This sequence (i-vii) is a chemically valid pathway to the target molecule. Its main drawback is the low yield in step (ii), which conflicts with the \"high-yield\" requirement.\n    *   Steps (viii) and (ix) are sulfonation and desulfonation of the final product. While unusual, this could theoretically be a purification technique to separate the desired product from isomers formed in earlier steps.\n    *   Compared to options A, C, and D, which contain chemically impossible steps, option B presents a complete and plausible (though not perfectly high-yield) synthesis. It is the only viable choice among the given options.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nDespite the low yield of the initial ortho-nitration step, the sequence of reactions presented in option B is the only one that is chemically sound from start to finish (or at least until the product is formed in step vii). The other options contain steps that are either impossible or lead to the wrong isomeric product. Therefore, B is the best answer.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "**1. Analysis of the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n- It is a tri-substituted benzene ring.\n- Substituents: Ethoxy (-OEt) at C1, tert-butyl (-tBu) at C2, and Nitro (-NO2) at C3.\n- The groups are located at adjacent positions (1, 2, 3).\n- Directing effects for electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS):\n    - **-OEt (Ethoxy)**: Strong activator, *ortho, para*-director.\n    - **-tBu (tert-butyl)**: Weak activator, *ortho, para*-director. It is very bulky, so it sterically hinders *ortho* positions.\n    - **-NO2 (Nitro)**: Strong deactivator, *meta*-director.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Evaluation of the Reaction Sequences**\n\nLet's analyze each option to see if the sequence of reactions is chemically logical and can lead to the desired product.\n\n**Option A:**\ni) HNO3/H2SO4: Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\nii) Fe/HCl: Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\niii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation attempted on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group (-NH2) of aniline. This forms a complex that strongly deactivates the ring, preventing the Friedel-Crafts reaction.\n*Conclusion: Option A is incorrect.*\n\n**Option C:**\ni) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: Benzene → tert-Butylbenzene.\nii) HNO3/H2SO4: tert-Butylbenzene → o/p-Nitro-tert-butylbenzene.\niii) SO3/H2SO4: Sulfonation of nitro-tert-butylbenzene.\niv) NaNO2/HCl: This is a diazotization reaction, which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2). The product from step (iii) is a sulfonic acid of a nitro-compound; it does not have an amino group.\n*Conclusion: Option C is incorrect.*\n\n**Option D:**\ni) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: Benzene → tert-Butylbenzene.\nii) SO3/H2SO4: tert-Butylbenzene → p-tert-Butylbenzenesulfonic acid (blocking the para position).\niii) HNO3/H2SO4: Nitration occurs *ortho* to the t-Bu group → 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.\niv) Fe/HCl: Reduction of the nitro group → 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\nv) NaNO2/HCl: Diazotization of the amino group.\nvi) HNO3/H2SO4: This step is chemically incorrect. It seems to suggest nitrating a diazonium salt or replacing the diazonium group with a nitro group using these reagents, neither of which is a standard, high-yield procedure. The Sandmeyer reaction to introduce a nitro group uses Cu/NaNO2.\n*Conclusion: Option D is incorrect.*\n\n**Option B:**\ni) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` on benzene → **tert-Butylbenzene**. (Standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation).\nii) `HNO3/H2SO4` on tert-butylbenzene → **o-Nitro-tert-butylbenzene** + p-Nitro-tert-butylbenzene. The -tBu group is an *o,p*-director, but due to its bulk, the *para* product is major. This step has a low yield for the required *ortho* isomer, but it is a chemically possible reaction. Let's assume the *ortho* isomer is separated and carried forward.\niii) `Fe/HCl` on o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene → **o-tert-Butylaniline** (2-tert-butylaniline). This is a standard reduction of a nitro group to an amine.\niv) `HNO3/H2SO4` on o-tert-butylaniline. This is a key step. Under strong acid conditions, the amino group (-NH2) is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a strong deactivator and a *meta*-director. The -tBu group is an *o,p*-director. The -NH3+ group at C1 directs the incoming nitro group to C3 and C5. The -tBu group at C2 activates the ring, especially at its *ortho* (C3, C6) and *para* (C4) positions. The combination of these effects strongly favors nitration at the C3 position, which is *meta* to the deactivating -NH3+ and *ortho* to the activating -tBu. This yields **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\nv) `NaNO2/HCl` on 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline → Forms the corresponding **diazonium salt**. (Standard diazotization).\nvi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat` on the diazonium salt → Hydrolyzes the diazonium salt to a phenol, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\nvii) `NaOH/EtBr` on 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol → Williamson ether synthesis. The phenol is deprotonated by NaOH to form a phenoxide, which then attacks ethyl bromide (EtBr) to form the ether. This gives the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nviii) and ix) These last two steps (sulfonation and desulfonation) are extraneous to the formation of the product but do not invalidate the preceding correct sequence.\n\n**Summary:**\nWhile step (ii) in option B is not a high-yield reaction for the required isomer, the overall sequence from (i) to (vii) is the only chemically logical and viable pathway among the choices provided to synthesize the target molecule. The other options contain fatal flaws (e.g., impossible reactions). Therefore, option B is the best answer.\n\n<<<B>>>",

Furthermore, step `vi) HNO3/H2SO4` is not a standard reaction for a diazonium salt.\n*   **Conclusion:** Option D is incorrect.\n\n**Option C:**\n1.  `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Forms tert-butylbenzene.\n2.  `ii) HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitrates tert-butylbenzene.\n3.  `iii) SO3/H2SO4`: Sulfonates the product from step ii.\n4.  `iv) NaNO2/HCl`: This is a diazotization reaction, which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2). The substrate at this point does not have an amino group.\n*   **Conclusion:** Option C is incorrect.\n\n**Option B:**\nThis sequence is the only remaining possibility. Let's verify its chemical logic.\n1.  **i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`**: Alkylation of benzene gives **tert-butylbenzene**. Correct.\n2.  **ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`**: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This produces a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. While the *para* isomer is the major product, the desired **o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene** is also formed and can be isolated.\n3.  **iii) `Fe/HCl`**: Reduction of the nitro group in o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene yields **o-tert-butylaniline**. Correct.\n4.  **iv) `HNO3/H2SO4`**: Nitration of o-tert-butylaniline. In the strongly acidic conditions, the amino group is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a strong deactivator and a *meta*-director. The t-butyl group is an activator and *o,p*-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to the C3 position. This is a highly regioselective step that yields **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n5.  **v) `NaNO2/HCl`**: Diazotization of the primary amine to form a diazonium salt. Correct.\n6.  **vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`**: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to form a phenol, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. Correct.\n7.  **vii) `NaOH/EtBr`**: Williamson ether synthesis. The phenol is deprotonated by NaOH to form a phenoxide, which then reacts with ethyl bromide to form the final ether product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. Correct.\nThe remaining steps (viii and ix) are superfluous, but the core synthesis (i-vii) is chemically sound and represents the only viable route among the choices.\n\n<<<B>>>"
