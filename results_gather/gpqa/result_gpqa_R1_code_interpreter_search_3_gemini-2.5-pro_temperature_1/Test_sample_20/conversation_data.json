    "*   **Analysis of Part A: Tautomerism**\n    *   **Tautomerism** is a form of isomerism where two structural isomers, called tautomers, are in rapid equilibrium. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of an α-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n    *   **Benzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone):** The structure consists of a six-membered ring with two C=C double bonds and two C=O double bonds at positions 1 and 4. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (the α-carbons) are C-2, C-3, C-5, and C-6. These carbons are part of the C=C double bonds and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached. Since there are no α-hydrogens, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups. The carbons between the ketone groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are CH₂ groups. The hydrogens on these carbons are α-hydrogens. The presence of these α-hydrogens allows the compound to undergo tautomerism to form its enol, which is phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). This enol form is aromatic and therefore very stable, meaning the equilibrium strongly favors the enol form. Thus, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n    *   **Optical isomerism** occurs in molecules that are chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. A common feature leading to chirality is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. Let's analyze the central carbon atom (C-2). It is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n        Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and therefore exhibits optical isomerism (exists as a pair of enantiomers).\n    *   **Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃ (the trans isomer). The molecule is planar. It contains a double bond, so there are no carbons with four single bonds that could be chiral centers. The molecule possesses a center of symmetry and a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Combination:**\n    *   Compound A (no tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n    *   This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n### **Part A: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism.**\n\n*   **Tautomerism** is a type of isomerism where isomers can interconvert by a chemical reaction. The most common form is **keto-enol tautomerism**, which requires the presence of an **α-hydrogen** (a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group) on an sp³-hybridized carbon atom. The α-hydrogen moves to the carbonyl oxygen, and a double bond forms between the α-carbon and the carbonyl carbon.\n\n*   **Analysis of Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with two ketone groups at positions 1 and 4, and two C=C double bonds. Its chemical formula is C₆H₄O₂.\n    *   **α-Carbons:** The carbons adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are the carbons at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6.\n    *   **α-Hydrogens:** In benzoquinone, these α-carbons are part of C=C double bonds (they are sp² hybridized). While they do have hydrogen atoms attached, these hydrogens are not on sp³ hybridized carbons. Attempting to form an enol from this structure would lead to a highly unstable intermediate (containing an allene within a six-membered ring), which is energetically unfavorable. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not exhibit keto-enol tautomerism.**\n\n*   **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are sp³ hybridized CH₂ groups.\n    *   **α-Carbons and α-Hydrogens:** The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are all α-carbons relative to the adjacent ketone groups. Each of these carbons has two α-hydrogens. These hydrogens are particularly acidic because they are positioned between two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n    *   **Tautomerization:** Due to the presence of these acidic α-hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione readily undergoes tautomerization. It can lose three protons and rearrange its double bonds to form its enol tautomer, **1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol)**. This enol form is an aromatic compound, making it exceptionally stable. Thus, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows tautomerism.**\n\n*   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Part B: Identifying the compound that shows optical isomerism.**\n\n*   **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of a **chiral center**, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n*   **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chiral Center:** Let's examine the central carbon atom (C-2). It is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since C-2 is attached to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center. A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral. Therefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism** (it exists as a pair of enantiomers).\n\n*   **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the *trans* isomer of the dimethyl ester of butenedioic acid (CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃).\n    *   **Chirality:** The molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond. It possesses both a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and a center of inversion (at the midpoint of the C=C bond). Molecules with a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion are achiral.\n    *   Since it is achiral, **dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism.**\n\n*   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n*   The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   The compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "This is a two-part problem. Let's break it down and analyze each part separately.\n\n### **Part A: Tautomerism**\n\nTautomerism is a form of isomerism where two structures, called tautomers, are in rapid equilibrium with each other. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have an α-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on a carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group, C=O) on an sp³-hybridized carbon.\n\n1.  **Benzoquinone (specifically, p-benzoquinone or 1,4-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two ketone groups opposite each other.\n    *   **α-Carbons:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the ring's C=C double bonds.\n    *   **α-Hydrogens:** These α-carbons are sp²-hybridized and do not have the type of α-hydrogens on an sp³ carbon that are required for standard keto-enol tautomerization. Any rearrangement would disrupt the cyclic conjugated system in a highly unfavorable way.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.

They have acidic α-hydrogens.\n    *   **Tautomerization:** Due to the presence of these acidic α-hydrogens, the compound can readily tautomerize. Its enol form is 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is an aromatic compound. The stability gained from forming an aromatic ring means this tautomerization occurs readily.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules.

It is attached to four different groups:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the carbon at position 2 is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and therefore **will show optical isomerism**.\n\n2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. This is the *trans* isomer.\n    *   **Chirality:** The molecule is planar. It possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and a center of inversion. Molecules with elements of symmetry like these are achiral. There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and **will not show optical isomerism**.\n\nTherefore, the compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Final Combination**\n\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "This problem requires a two-part analysis: first, identifying which compound does not exhibit tautomerism, and second, identifying which compound shows optical isomerism.\n\n### **Part 1: Tautomerism**\n\nTautomerism is a chemical equilibrium between two structural isomers. The most common form is keto-enol tautomerism, which involves the migration of a proton (hydrogen ion) and the shifting of a double bond. A key requirement for keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of an **α-hydrogen**—a hydrogen atom on an sp³-hybridized carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** The structure is a six-membered ring with two C=O groups at positions 1 and 4, and two C=C double bonds. The carbons adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are themselves part of the C=C double bonds. These carbons are sp²-hybridized and lack the type of mobile α-hydrogens on an sp³ carbon needed for tautomerization. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** The structure is a six-membered ring with three C=O groups. The carbons between the carbonyl groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are sp³-hybridized and each has two hydrogen atoms. These are α-hydrogens and are particularly acidic because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups. This compound readily tautomerizes to form its enol, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is an aromatic and thus very stable molecule. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**.\n\n**Conclusion for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Part 2: Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism exhibited by chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicator of chirality is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. Let's analyze the central carbon atom (C-2), which is bonded to the -OH group. The four groups attached to this carbon are:\n    1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n    2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n    3.  -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n    4.  -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n    Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and therefore **will show optical isomerism**.\n\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. This is the *trans* isomer of a molecule with a carbon-carbon double bond. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry. Any molecule with a plane or center of symmetry is achiral and cannot be optically active. Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n**Conclusion for Part B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) = **benzoquinone**\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) = **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
