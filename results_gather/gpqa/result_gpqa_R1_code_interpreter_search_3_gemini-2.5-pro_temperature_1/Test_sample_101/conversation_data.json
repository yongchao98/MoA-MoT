The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane barrel with eight alpha helices, four extracellular helices, and three beta sheets that create a binding site for the ligand. The ligand is a coiled-coil of two alpha helices. You create a bicistronic lox-Cre vector with the ligand ORF at the 5' position, fused to mCherry; the receptor ORF is at the 3' and fused to the eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and upstream of the receptor is the IRES regulatory element.

    "Here's a thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the User's Experimental Setup:** I need to understand every component of the molecular and genetic experiment described.\n\n    *   **Goal:** Understand the developmental fate of a new ligand-receptor pair from neural crest cells.\n    *   **Receptor:** Monomeric transmembrane protein.\n    *   **Ligand:** Coiled-coil of two alpha helices.\n    *   **Tool (Vector):** A bicistronic lox-Cre vector. \"Bicistronic\" means one mRNA is intended to produce two separate proteins. \"lox-Cre\" means its function is dependent on Cre recombinase.\n    *   **Vector Layout (pre-Cre recombination):**\n        *   **Promoter:** CBA promoter. This is a strong, ubiquitous promoter. This means the construct should be transcribed in many, if not all, cell types.\n        *   **First Gene Block:** `Ligand ORF -> loxP-stop-loxP -> mCherry`. The \"stop\" cassette prevents translation from reading through to mCherry.\n        *   **Linker:** IRES (Internal Ribosome Entry Site). This element allows translation to start internally on the mRNA, right before the receptor ORF. This is how the bicistronic nature is achieved.\n        *   **Second Gene Block:** `Receptor ORF -> lox2272-stop-lox2272 -> eGFP`. The \"stop\" cassette here prevents translation from reading through to eGFP. The eGFP is fused at the C-terminus of the receptor.\n    *   **In Vitro Test:** Transfection into astrocytes, followed by Western blot. The result is \"Total proteins give a signal proportional to the actin loading.\" This is slightly ambiguous, but the most logical interpretation is that the Western blot using antibodies against the ligand and receptor was successful. This would confirm that, without Cre, the vector is capable of producing the ligand protein (translation stops at the first stop cassette) and the receptor protein (translation starts at the IRES and stops at the second stop cassette). It confirms the promoter, the ORFs, and the IRES are functional.\n    *   **In Vivo Model:**\n        *   Mouse 1: Homozygous for the construct (`MyConstruct/MyConstruct`).\n        *   Mouse 2: Hemizygous for `SOX10-Cre`. SOX10 is a transcription factor that defines the neural crest lineage. This means Cre recombinase will be expressed in neural crest cells and their derivatives.\n        *   Cross: `MyConstruct/MyConstruct` x `SOX10-Cre/+`. The relevant offspring for analysis are `MyConstruct/+ ; SOX10-Cre/+`.\n    *   **Expected Outcome in `SOX10-Cre` positive cells:**\n        *   Cre recombinase recognizes the `loxP` sites and cuts out the \"stop\" cassette. This should result in a single, in-frame `Ligand-mCherry` fusion protein. We should see red fluorescence.\n        *   Cre recombinase also recognizes the `lox2272` sites (Cre works on both `loxP` and `lox2272`) and cuts out the second \"stop\" cassette. This should result in a single, in-frame `Receptor-eGFP` fusion protein. We should see green fluorescence.\n    *   **Observed Outcome:** \"You do not observe a green signal.\" The red signal (mCherry) is not mentioned, but the key failure is the lack of eGFP.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Potential Causes (The Options):** Now I'll evaluate each option based on the experimental design and the observed failure.\n\n    *   **A) the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame:**\n        *   How does Cre recombination work? It removes the DNA between the two lox sites, leaving one lox site behind.\n        *   The structure goes from `Receptor ORF -> [lox2272]--stop--[lox2272] -> eGFP` to `Receptor ORF -> [lox2272] -> eGFP`.\n        *   The remaining `lox2272` site has a DNA sequence of 34 base pairs.\n        *   For the Receptor protein and the eGFP protein to be fused correctly, the total number of base pairs from the end of the Receptor's coding sequence to the start of the eGFP's coding sequence must be a multiple of 3.\n        *   A 34 bp lox site is *not* a multiple of 3 (34 / 3 = 11 with a remainder of 1).\n        *   Therefore, the presence of the residual lox2272 site will cause a frameshift mutation. This means the ribosome will read the codons for eGFP in the wrong frame, leading to a garbage amino acid sequence and, almost certainly, a premature stop codon. No functional, fluorescent eGFP protein will be made.\n        *   This is a very common and classic error in designing this type of conditional reporter. It is a highly plausible reason for the complete lack of a green signal.\n\n    *   **B) the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi:**\n        *   The receptor is a transmembrane protein, so it must be trafficked through the secretory pathway (ER -> Golgi -> plasma membrane).\n        *   If the Receptor-eGFP fusion protein misfolds, it could be retained by quality control mechanisms in the ER or Golgi.\n        *   However, if it were simply \"stuck,\" the eGFP protein would still have been synthesized and would still be fluorescent. A confocal microscope would detect green fluorescence, just not at the cell surface. It would be seen as a bright blob in the perinuclear region corresponding to the Golgi/ER.\n        *   The problem states \"You do not observe a green signal,\" which implies a complete absence of fluorescence, not mislocalization. So, this option is unlikely.\n\n    *   **C) the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing:**\n        *   The construct uses the CBA promoter. The CBA (Chicken Beta-Actin) promoter is a very strong, ubiquitously active promoter. It contains its own enhancer element (from CMV). It does not rely on endogenous enhancers near its insertion site.\n        *   The purpose of the `SOX10-Cre` is to *activate the reporters (mCherry, eGFP)* by removing the stop cassettes, not to *drive the transcription* of the construct. The CBA promoter is already driving transcription.\n        *   Therefore, the lack of a specific enhancer is not the issue. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) ligand and the receptor are in a paracrine relationship:**\n        *   A paracrine relationship means a cell releases a signal that affects a neighboring cell. An autocrine relationship is when the signal affects the same cell that released it.\n        *   This experiment is designed to produce both the ligand and the receptor in the same cell (the `SOX10` lineage cells). This sets up an artificial autocrine loop to label the cells.\n        *   Whether the *natural* biological interaction is paracrine or autocrine is what the experiment might help to figure out, but it has no bearing on the technical success of the reporter construct itself. The construct is designed to express Receptor-eGFP in a cell, regardless of where the ligand comes from.\n        *   Therefore, the natural signaling mechanism is irrelevant to why the eGFP protein is not being produced. This option is incorrect.\n\n3.  **Synthesize and Conclude:**\n    *   Options B, C, and D are inconsistent with the experimental details or the specific observation.\n    *   Option A describes a common, fundamental molecular biology error that perfectly explains the observed result: a complete failure to produce a functional fluorescent protein due to a frameshift introduced by the residual lox site after recombination.\n\nThis detailed breakdown confirms that A is the most scientifically sound and likely explanation for the experimental failure.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This question requires a deep understanding of molecular biology techniques, specifically Cre-lox recombination and the design of reporter constructs for transgenic animals. Let's break down the experimental setup and analyze why the expected result (green fluorescence) was not observed.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Transgenic Construct:**\n    *   **Promoter:** The construct is driven by the Chicken Beta-Actin (CBA) promoter. This is a strong, ubiquitous promoter, meaning it will drive transcription of the downstream genes in virtually all cells of the mouse.\n    *   **Bicistronic Design:** The construct is designed to produce two proteins from a single messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule. This is achieved using an Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES). The ribosome translates the first open reading frame (ORF), and then the IRES element allows the ribosome to re-initiate translation on the second ORF within the same mRNA.\n    *   **First Cistron (Ligand Reporter):** `Ligand ORF - loxP-stop-loxP - mCherry`.\n        *   Without Cre recombinase, transcription and translation produce the ligand protein, but translation terminates at the stop cassette. No mCherry is made.\n        *   In the presence of Cre, the `stop` cassette is excised. This creates a continuous open reading frame for a `Ligand-mCherry` fusion protein. The cell should fluoresce red.\n    *   **Second Cistron (Receptor Reporter):** `IRES - Receptor ORF - lox2272-stop-lox2272 - eGFP`.\n        *   Without Cre, translation initiates at the IRES and produces the receptor protein, but terminates at the second stop cassette. No eGFP is made.\n        *   In the presence of Cre, the `stop` cassette flanked by `lox2272` sites is excised. This is intended to create a continuous open reading frame for a `Receptor-eGFP` fusion protein. The cell should fluoresce green.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Animal Model and Experiment:**\n    *   A mouse homozygous for the construct is crossed with a `SOX10-Cre` mouse.\n    *   `SOX10` is a transcription factor expressed in neural crest cells and their derivatives. This means Cre recombinase will only be present in this specific cell lineage.\n    *   In the offspring, in `SOX10`-positive cells, Cre should excise both stop cassettes, leading to the production of both the Ligand-mCherry and Receptor-eGFP fusion proteins.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Observed Result:**\n    *   The key observation is: \"You do not observe a green signal.\" This means the Receptor-eGFP fusion protein is not being produced correctly or is not functional.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Potential Explanations (The Options):**\n\n    *   **A) the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame:** This is a highly plausible technical explanation. Cre-mediated recombination between two lox sites (like `lox2272`) removes the DNA between them but leaves behind a single lox site scar. A standard lox site is 34 base pairs long. For a fusion protein to be made correctly, the number of base pairs in the \"linker\" region (in this case, the leftover lox site) must be a multiple of 3 to maintain the correct reading frame. Since 34 is not divisible by 3 (34 ÷ 3 = 11 with a remainder of 1), the translation of the eGFP sequence will be shifted by one base pair. This frameshift mutation will result in the production of a garbage peptide sequence instead of functional eGFP, and a premature stop codon is almost certain to be encountered. This perfectly explains the complete absence of a green signal.\n\n    *   **B) the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi:** The receptor is a transmembrane protein and must pass through the secretory pathway (ER and Golgi). If the fusion protein were misfolded, it might be retained in the Golgi or ER. However, the eGFP part of the protein would still be synthesized and folded correctly, making it fluorescent. A confocal microscope would detect a green signal, but it would be mislocalized to an internal compartment (like the Golgi apparatus) instead of the cell surface. The observation is a *complete absence* of a green signal, not a mislocalized one. Thus, this option is unlikely.\n\n    *   **C) the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing:** The construct uses the CBA promoter, which is a strong, ubiquitously active promoter containing its own enhancer elements. It does not rely on a specific endogenous enhancer. The purpose of the `SOX10-Cre` is to activate the reporters by removing the stop cassettes, not to drive transcription. Therefore, a missing enhancer is not the problem.\n\n    *   **D) ligand and the receptor are in a paracrine relationship:** A paracrine relationship (cell signaling to a neighbor) versus an autocrine one (cell signaling to itself) is a biological question about the system's natural function. It has no bearing on the technical machinery of the reporter construct. The production of the Receptor-eGFP fusion protein within a cell depends on transcription, translation, and the successful removal of the stop cassette by Cre, not on how the ligand and receptor interact biologically. This option is irrelevant to the technical failure observed.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe most likely reason for the lack of a green signal is a fundamental error in the molecular design of the reporter construct. The 34 bp lox2272 scar left after Cre-mediated recombination causes a frameshift mutation, preventing the correct translation of the eGFP protein.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This question tests your understanding of advanced molecular biology concepts, particularly the design of conditional knockout/reporter systems using Cre-lox technology. Let's break down the experiment to find the flaw.\n\n### Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the Construct Design:** The core of the problem lies in the genetic construct. It's a bicistronic vector, meaning one mRNA is intended to produce two proteins.\n    *   **Promoter:** CBA (Chicken Beta-Actin) promoter is strong and ubiquitous. This means the construct will be transcribed in almost all cells of the mouse.\n    *   **First Protein Cassette:** `Ligand ORF - loxP-stop-loxP - mCherry`. This is a \"conditional reporter\" design. In the absence of Cre recombinase, translation hits the stop cassette and terminates, producing only the ligand. In the presence of Cre, the stop cassette is excised, creating a single `Ligand-mCherry` fusion protein.\n    *   **IRES:** An Internal Ribosome Entry Site allows translation to begin again at this point on the mRNA. This is how the second protein is made from the same transcript.\n    *   **Second Protein Cassette:** `Receptor ORF - lox2272-stop-lox2272 - eGFP`. This is another conditional reporter, similar to the first. `lox2272` is a variant of `loxP` that is also recognized by Cre recombinase. Without Cre, only the receptor protein is made. With Cre, the stop cassette is supposed to be excised, creating a `Receptor-eGFP` fusion protein.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Genetic Cross:**\n    *   The construct mouse is crossed with a `SOX10-Cre` mouse.\n    *   SOX10 is a transcription factor specific to the neural crest lineage. This means Cre recombinase will only be expressed in neural crest cells and their descendants.\n    *   Therefore, in SOX10-positive cells, Cre should be present and should cut out both stop cassettes.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Expected vs. Observed Outcome:**\n    *   **Expected:** In neural crest-derived cells, you should see red fluorescence (from Ligand-mCherry) and green fluorescence (from Receptor-eGFP).\n    *   **Observed:** \"You do not observe a green signal.\" This points to a specific failure in the production or function of the Receptor-eGFP protein.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Possible Reasons:**\n\n    *   **A) the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame:** Let's look closely at the Cre-lox recombination process. When Cre acts on the two `lox2272` sites, it removes the DNA between them but leaves one `lox2272` site behind. A lox site (both `loxP` and `lox2272`) is 34 base pairs (bp) long. For a fusion protein to be made correctly, the coding sequences of the two parts (Receptor and eGFP) must remain in the same translational reading frame. This means any \"linker\" DNA between them must have a length that is a multiple of 3 (since one amino acid is coded by 3 base pairs). The 34 bp `lox2272` scar is *not* a multiple of 3 (34 / 3 = 11 with a remainder of 1). This will cause a frameshift mutation. The ribosome will read the eGFP sequence in the wrong frame, produce a non-functional string of amino acids, and likely encounter a premature stop codon. No functional, fluorescent eGFP will be made. This is a classic design flaw and perfectly explains the result.\n\n    *   **B) the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi:** The receptor is a transmembrane protein, so it traffics through the ER-Golgi pathway. If the fusion protein was misfolded, it might be retained in the Golgi. However, the eGFP portion would likely still be synthesized and fluorescent. Therefore, you would observe a green signal, but it would be mislocalized to an internal compartment instead of the cell surface. The problem states there is *no* green signal, not a mislocalized one.\n\n    *   **C) the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing:** The construct uses the strong, ubiquitous CBA promoter, which contains its own enhancer elements. The role of `SOX10-Cre` is to provide the recombinase enzyme, not an enhancer for transcription. Transcription should be occurring in all cells; the *translation* of the reporters is what is conditional on Cre.\n\n    *   **D) ligand and the receptor are in a paracrine relationship:** Whether the natural interaction is paracrine (acting on a neighbor cell) or autocrine (acting on the same cell) is a biological question. It has no impact on the technical ability of the engineered construct to produce a fluorescent protein inside the cell where it is transcribed and translated.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe most direct and technically sound explanation for the complete lack of a green signal is the frameshift mutation introduced by the 34 bp `lox2272` scar that remains after Cre-mediated recombination.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This is an excellent question that requires a deep understanding of molecular genetics and the Cre-lox system. Let's break down the experimental design step-by-step to identify the most probable cause of the failure.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The aim is to track cells expressing a specific ligand-receptor pair that originates in the neural crest. This is a cell fate mapping experiment.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reporter Construct:** The core of the experiment is the bicistronic vector.\n    *   **Promoter:** It uses the CBA promoter, which is strong and generally active in all cell types. This means the mRNA for the construct will be made ubiquitously.\n    *   **First Gene (Ligand):** `Ligand ORF - loxP-stop-loxP - mCherry`. This is a conditional reporter. In cells without Cre recombinase, only the Ligand protein is made. In cells with Cre, the \"stop\" cassette is excised, creating a `Ligand-mCherry` fusion protein, which should be red.\n    *   **Second Gene (Receptor):** The IRES element allows translation to start again on the same mRNA. The cassette is `Receptor ORF - lox2272-stop-lox2272 - eGFP`. Similar to the first, this is a conditional reporter. `lox2272` is a variant of `loxP` that is also recognized by Cre. Without Cre, only the Receptor protein is made. With Cre, the stop cassette should be removed to create a `Receptor-eGFP` fusion protein, which should be green.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Animal Model:** The reporter mouse is crossed with a `SOX10-Cre` mouse.\n    *   SOX10 is a transcription factor that is a key marker for the neural crest lineage.\n    *   This means Cre recombinase will be specifically expressed in neural crest cells and all their descendant cell types.\n    *   Therefore, in any cell derived from the neural crest, Cre should be active and excise both stop cassettes.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Expected vs. Observed Result:**\n    *   **Expected Outcome:** In the offspring, cells of the neural crest lineage should express both `Ligand-mCherry` and `Receptor-eGFP`, and thus should fluoresce both red and green.\n    *   **Observed Outcome:** \"You do not observe a green signal.\" This points to a specific failure in the second half of the construct, related to the Receptor-eGFP fusion.\n\n5.  **Assess the Options:**\n\n    *   **A) the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame:** This is the most critical technical detail to check. When Cre recombinase acts on the two `lox2272` sites, it removes the DNA between them (the stop cassette) but leaves behind a single `lox2272` site as a \"scar\". A lox site is 34 base pairs (bp) long. For a fusion protein to be translated correctly, the number of base pairs in any linker or scar sequence between the two protein-coding domains must be a multiple of 3 to maintain the correct reading frame. The number 34 is not a multiple of 3 (34 ÷ 3 = 11, with a remainder of 1). This means that after the ribosome translates the receptor, the 34 bp lox scar will shift the reading frame by one base. Consequently, the eGFP sequence will be translated in the wrong frame, producing a garbage sequence of amino acids instead of a functional, fluorescent protein. This is a classic and fatal flaw in this type of reporter design and perfectly explains the complete absence of a green signal.\n\n    *   **B) the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi:** The receptor is a transmembrane protein and travels through the ER/Golgi secretory pathway. If the fusion protein was misfolded, it might be retained by quality control machinery in the Golgi. However, the eGFP protein itself would still have been synthesized and would be fluorescent. A confocal microscope would still detect a green signal, although it would be located inside the cell (in the Golgi) rather than at the cell surface. The problem states there is *no* green signal, not a mislocalized one. Therefore, this is unlikely.\n\n    *   **C) the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing:** The construct uses the CBA promoter, a strong, composite promoter that includes its own enhancer elements and drives ubiquitous expression. The system does not rely on a separate or endogenous enhancer. The tissue specificity comes from the `SOX10-Cre` driver, not the promoter on the reporter construct.\n\n    *   **D) ligand and the receptor are in a paracrine relationship:** A paracrine relationship (signaling to a nearby cell) versus an autocrine one (signaling to the same cell) is a biological property of the system. This property does not affect the technical ability of the engineered construct to produce a fluorescent protein inside a cell. The production of Receptor-eGFP is an intracellular process dependent on transcription and translation, not on cell-to-cell interaction.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe most scientifically sound and probable reason for the lack of a green signal is a fundamental design flaw in the reporter construct. The 34 bp lox2272 scar left after recombination introduces a frameshift mutation, preventing the correct translation of eGFP.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This is a complex question involving molecular biology, genetics, and the design of transgenic animal models. Let's break down the experimental setup to identify the most likely reason for the observed result.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Experimental Design:**\n    *   **Goal:** To track the fate of neural crest cells that express a specific ligand and receptor.\n    *   **Tool:** A bicistronic reporter construct. \"Bicistronic\" means one mRNA transcript is used to produce two separate proteins. This is achieved using an IRES (Internal Ribosome Entry Site).\n    *   **Reporter System:** The system is \"conditional,\" meaning it is activated by Cre recombinase. This is achieved by placing `loxP`-flanked \"stop\" cassettes (`loxP-stop-loxP` and `lox2272-stop-lox2272`) that prevent the translation of the fluorescent proteins (mCherry and eGFP).\n    *   **Animal Model:** The reporter mouse is crossed with a `SOX10-Cre` mouse. SOX10 is a transcription factor specific to the neural crest lineage. This means Cre recombinase will only be expressed in neural crest cells and their descendants.\n    *   **Expected Outcome:** In `SOX10`-expressing cells, Cre recombinase should be present. It will recognize the `loxP` and `lox2272` sites and excise both stop cassettes. This should lead to the production of two fusion proteins: `Ligand-mCherry` (red) and `Receptor-eGFP` (green).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Observed Result:**\n    *   The key finding is: \"You do not observe a green signal.\" This indicates a specific failure in the production or function of the `Receptor-eGFP` fusion protein.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Possible Explanations:**\n\n    *   **A) the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame:** This is a crucial detail in designing fusion proteins with the Cre-lox system. When Cre recombinase removes the DNA between two lox sites (like the `lox2272-stop-lox2272` cassette), it leaves behind a single `lox2272` site as a \"scar.\" A standard lox site is **34 base pairs** long. For the ribosome to correctly translate both the receptor and the eGFP as a single fusion protein, the number of base pairs in the linker region (the lox scar) must be a multiple of 3. The number 34 is not divisible by 3 (34 ÷ 3 = 11 with a remainder of 1). This means the 34 bp lox scar will shift the translational reading frame by one base. As a result, the mRNA sequence for eGFP will be read incorrectly, producing a string of non-functional amino acids and almost certainly encountering a premature stop codon. No functional, fluorescent eGFP protein will be made. This is a classic design flaw and perfectly explains the complete absence of a green signal.\n\n    *   **B) the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi:** The receptor is a transmembrane protein that must be processed through the ER and Golgi. If the fusion protein were misfolded and retained in the Golgi, it would still have been synthesized and the eGFP portion would still be fluorescent. A confocal microscope would detect a green signal, but it would be mislocalized inside the cell (likely as a bright spot near the nucleus) instead of at the cell membrane. The observation is a *complete absence* of a green signal, which contradicts this explanation.\n\n    *   **C) the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing:** The construct uses the CBA promoter, a strong, ubiquitous promoter that contains its own enhancer elements. It is designed to drive transcription in most cell types. The tissue-specific *activation* of the fluorescent reporters is controlled by the `SOX10-Cre` mouse, not by a specific enhancer in the reporter construct itself. Therefore, this is not the issue.\n\n    *   **D) ligand and the receptor are in a paracrine relationship:** A paracrine relationship describes how cells communicate with each other (a cell secretes a ligand that acts on a neighbor). This is a biological property of the native system. The engineered construct is an artificial reporter designed to function *inside* the cell. Whether the natural interaction is paracrine or autocrine has no effect on the technical ability of the cell to transcribe and translate the `Receptor-eGFP` fusion protein.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe most likely explanation for the experimental failure is a fundamental error in the molecular design. The residual 34 bp lox2272 site introduces a frameshift mutation, preventing the correct translation of the eGFP protein.\n\n<<<A>>>"

You can also solve the question without code and searching, just by your textual reasoning.\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code or search queries to solve the problem.\n\n    question: You identified a new ligand-receptor pair initially expressed in the neural crest cells and want to understand the developmental fate of their interaction. The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane barrel with eight alpha helices, four extracellular helices, and three beta sheets that create a binding site for the ligand. The ligand is a coiled-coil of two alpha helices. You create a bicistronic lox-Cre vector with the ligand ORF at the 5' position, fused to mCherry; the receptor ORF is at the 3' and fused to the eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and upstream of the receptor is the IRES regulatory element. Between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there is a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and between the receptor and the eGFP, there is a stop in the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. You had also raised antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and now use them to test the construct expression on the Western blot after plasmid transfection to primary astrocyte culture. Total proteins give a signal proportional to the actin loading. You finally breed a mouse model homozygous for your construct in the wt background. You cross it to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice; after the offspring is born you visualize them under the fluorescent confocal microscope. You do not observe a green signal. Which of the answers below explains the most likely reason for it?\n\nA) the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame\nB) the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi\nC) the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing\nD) ligand and the receptor are in a paracrine relationship\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n",
