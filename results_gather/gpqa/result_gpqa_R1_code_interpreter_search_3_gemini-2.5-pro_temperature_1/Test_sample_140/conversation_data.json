    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (D, an isotope of hydrogen) at position 2.\n    *   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃). NaNH₂ is an extremely strong base.\n    *   **Reaction:** The reaction of an aryl halide with a very strong base like NaNH₂ is a classic example of an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination to form Benzyne Intermediates**\n    *   The amide ion (NH₂⁻) acts as a base and abstracts a proton (or in this case, a proton or a deuteron) from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the leaving group (the bromine atom).\n    *   In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, the bromine is at C1. The two *ortho* positions are C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 has a deuterium atom (D).\n    *   C6 has a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   Because the C-H bond is weaker and more easily broken than the C-D bond (this is known as the kinetic isotope effect), the abstraction of the proton from C6 is faster. However, the question asks for all *possible* products, so we must consider both pathways, even if one is slower.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Two Possible Elimination Pathways:**\n\n    *   **Pathway A (Major): Abstraction of H from C6**\n        1.  The amide ion (NH₂⁻) removes the proton (H⁺) from C6.\n        2.  A carbanion is formed at C6.\n        3.  This carbanion expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from the adjacent C1 position.\n        4.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **3-deuteriobenzyne**.\n\n         \n\n    *   **Pathway B (Minor): Abstraction of D from C2**\n        1.  The amide ion (NH₂⁻) removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C2.\n        2.  A carbanion is formed at C2.\n        3.  This carbanion expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from the adjacent C1 position.\n        4.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, both the bromine and the deuterium are eliminated. The resulting intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n         \n\n4.  **Step 2: Addition of Nucleophile to Benzyne Intermediates**\n    *   The amide ion (NH₂⁻) now acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne's triple bond. This is followed by protonation from the solvent (liquid ammonia, NH₃) to give the final aniline product(s).\n\n5.  **Analyze the Products from Each Benzyne Intermediate:**\n\n    *   **Products from Pathway A (via 3-deuteriobenzyne):**\n        *   The intermediate is unsymmetrical (D at C2, triple bond at C1-C6). The nucleophile NH₂⁻ can attack either C1 or C6.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** NH₂⁻ adds to C1, creating a carbanion at C6. Protonation of C6 yields a product with the -NH₂ group at C1 and the -D at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   **Attack at C6:** NH₂⁻ adds to C6, creating a carbanion at C1. Protonation of C1 yields a product with the -NH₂ group at C6 and the -D at C2. The relationship between a group at C6 and a group at C2 is *meta*. Therefore, this product is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   So, Pathway A yields **two** distinct products.\n\n    *   **Products from Pathway B (via benzyne):**\n        *   The intermediate is the symmetrical, non-deuterated benzyne.\n        *   Attack of NH₂⁻ at C1 or C2 leads to the same carbanion intermediate.\n        *   Protonation of this intermediate yields a single product: **aniline** (with no deuterium).\n        *   So, Pathway B yields **one** product.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Combining the products from both possible pathways, we have three distinct possible organic products:\n        1.  2-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n        2.  3-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n        3.

    "This reaction proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism involving benzyne intermediates. Let's break down the process step-by-step.\n\n**Step 1: Elimination to Form Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe strong base, sodium amide (NaNH₂), provides the amide ion (NH₂⁻), which abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* to the bromine atom.

While the C-D bond is stronger than the C-H bond (kinetic isotope effect), this pathway is still possible and leads to a distinct product, so it must be considered.\n    2.
