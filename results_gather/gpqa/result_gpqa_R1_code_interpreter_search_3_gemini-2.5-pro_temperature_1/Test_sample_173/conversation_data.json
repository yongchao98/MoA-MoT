    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** An atomic nucleus is at rest.\n    *   Mass = M\n    *   Rest-mass energy = E_initial = M * c^2 = 300 GeV\n    *   Initial momentum = P_initial = 0\n\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments.\n    *   Rest masses of fragments: m1 and m2.\n    *   Kinetic energies of fragments: T1 and T2.\n    *   Momentums of fragments: p1 and p2.\n    *   The problem states m1 is the more massive fragment. Let's set m1 = 2 * m2.\n    *   The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M.\n\n**2. Calculate the Rest Masses of the Fragments**\n\nWe are given the rest-mass energies, which is more convenient to work with. Let's use E = mc^2.\n*   m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * (M*c^2)\n*   m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV\n\nWe have a system of two equations:\n1.  m1*c^2 = 2 * (m2*c^2)\n2.  m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV\n\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\n*   2 * (m2*c^2) + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV\n*   3 * (m2*c^2) = 297 GeV\n*   m2*c^2 = 99 GeV\n\nNow find the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (m1):\n*   m1*c^2 = 2 * (99 GeV) = 198 GeV\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy released as kinetic energy (Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy. This comes from the conservation of total energy.\n*   Q = E_initial - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)\n*   Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV\n*   This energy is shared between the two fragments: Q = T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.\n\n**4. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) Kinetic Energy T1**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total final momentum must be zero. The fragments fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n    *   p1 = p2 = p\n\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** The total energy E of a particle is given by E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2. The total energy is the sum of rest-mass energy and kinetic energy: E = m*c^2 + T.\n\n*   From the energy-momentum relation, we can write: (p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2.\n    *   For fragment 1: (p*c)^2 = E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2\n    *   For fragment 2: (p*c)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2\n    *   Therefore: E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2\n\n*   **Conservation of Total Energy:** The total energy before fission equals the total energy after.\n    *   M*c^2 = E1 + E2\n    *   300 GeV = E1 + E2  =>  E2 = 300 - E1\n\n*   Now substitute E2 into the momentum equation:\n    *   E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = (300 - E1)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2\n    *   Plug in the values for m1*c^2 (198 GeV) and m2*c^2 (99 GeV):\n    *   E1^2 - 198^2 = (300^2 - 600*E1 + E1^2) - 99^2\n    *   -198^2 = 300^2 - 600*E1 - 99^2\n    *   600*E1 = 300^2 + 198^2 - 99^2\n    *   600*E1 = 90000 + 39204 - 9801 = 119403\n    *   E1 = 119403 / 600 = 199.005 GeV\n\n*   The kinetic energy T1 is the total energy E1 minus the rest-mass energy m1*c^2:\n    *   T1_relativistic = E1 - m1*c^2 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV\n\n**5. Calculate the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Kinetic Energy T1**\n\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is T = p^2 / (2m).\n*   From conservation of momentum, p1 = p2 = p.\n*   The ratio of the kinetic energies is:\n    *   T1 / T2 = (p^2 / (2*m1)) / (p^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1\n*   Since m1 = 2*m2, the ratio is T1 / T2 = 1/2, or T2 = 2*T1.\n*   The total kinetic energy is T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.\n*   Substitute T2 = 2*T1:\n    *   T1 + 2*T1 = 3 GeV\n    *   3*T1 = 3 GeV\n    *   T1_classical = 1 GeV\n\n**6. Find the Difference**\n\n*   The difference is the relativistic value minus the classical value.\n*   Difference = T1_relativistic - T1_classical\n*   Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV\n\n*   The question asks for the answer in MeV. We convert GeV to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n*   Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV\n\nTo be certain of the calculation, we can use a Python script.\n```python\n# All energy values are in GeV\n# Initial rest-mass energy\nM_c2 = 300.0\n\n# Final total rest-mass energy\nfinal_rest_mass_energy = 0.99 * M_c2\n\n# Rest-mass energies of the two fragments\n# m1_c2 + m2_c2 = final_rest_mass_energy\n# m1_c2 = 2 * m2_c2\n# => 3 * m2_c2 = final_rest_mass_energy\nm2_c2 = final_rest_mass_energy / 3.0\nm1_c2 = 2.0 * m2_c2\n\n# Total kinetic energy released (Q-value)\nQ = M_c2 - final_rest_mass_energy\n\n# Relativistic calculation for T1\n# We derived the formula: E1 = ( (M*c^2)^2 + (m1*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2 ) / (2 * M*c^2)\nE1 = (M_c2**2 + m1_c2**2 - m2_c2**2) / (2 * M_c2)\nT1_relativistic = E1 - m1_c2\n\n# Classical calculation for T1\n# We derived that 3 * T1 = Q in the classical approximation\nT1_classical = Q / 3.0\n\n# Calculate the difference in MeV\ndifference_GeV = T1_relativistic - T1_classical\ndifference_MeV = difference_GeV * 1000\n\nprint(f\"{difference_MeV}\")\n```\n5.0\nThe result from the code confirms the manual calculation.\n\nFinal answer is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<C>>>",

Determine the rest-mass energies of the initial nucleus and the fragments.**\n\n*   Initial rest-mass energy: `E_i = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   Let the rest masses of the fragments be `m1` and `m2`, with `m1` being the more massive one.\n*   We are given `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   The sum of the rest-mass energies of the fragments is 99% of the initial rest-mass energy:\n    `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * M*c^2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   Now we solve the system of equations:\n    1.  `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2`\n    2.  `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n*   Substitute (1) into (2): `(2 * m2*c^2) + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n*   `3 * m2*c^2 = 297 GeV` => `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`.\n*   Then, `m1*c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value).**\n\n*   The Q-value is the initial rest-mass energy minus the final total rest-mass energy. This difference is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n*   `Q = T1 + T2 = E_i - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate the kinetic energy T1 using the classical approximation.**\n\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   Since the initial nucleus was at rest, by conservation of momentum, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta: `p1 = p2 = p`.\n*   The ratio of their kinetic energies is: `T1_classical / T2_classical = (p^2 / (2*m1)) / (p^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1`.\n*   Since `m1 = 2*m2`, the ratio is `1/2`. So, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n*   We know `T1_classical + T2_classical = Q = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substituting `T2`: `T1_classical + 2*T1_classical = 3 GeV` => `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate the correct (relativistic) kinetic energy T1.**\n\n*   We use conservation of total energy and momentum.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The magnitudes of the momenta are equal, `p1 = p2 = p`. The relativistic energy-momentum relation is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n*   Therefore, `(p*c)^2 = E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2` and `(p*c)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`.\n*   This gives: `E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`.\n*   **Conservation of Total Energy:** The total energy before (rest-mass energy of M) equals the total energy after (sum of total energies of fragments). The total energy of a fragment is `E = T + m*c^2`.\n*   `M*c^2 = E1 + E2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   From this, `E2 = 300 - E1`.\n*   Now substitute `E2` and the rest-mass energies into the momentum equation:\n    `E1^2 - (198)^2 = (300 - E1)^2 - (99)^2`\n    `E1^2 - 39204 = (90000 - 600*E1 + E1^2) - 9801`\n*   The `E1^2` terms cancel out:\n    `-39204 = 90000 - 600*E1 - 9801`\n    `600*E1 = 90000 + 39204 - 9801`\n    `600*E1 = 119403`\n    `E1 = 119403 / 600 = 199.005 GeV`.\n*   The relativistic kinetic energy `T1` is the total energy `E1` minus the rest-mass energy `m1*c^2`:\n    `T1_relativistic = E1 - m1*c^2 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**5.

Calculate T1 using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nIn classical physics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   The initial nucleus is at rest, so by the law of conservation of momentum, the final total momentum must also be zero.

Calculate T1 using Classical Approximation**\n*   By conservation of momentum (`p=mv`), the fragment with less mass has more velocity. The kinetic energies (`T = p^2/2m`) are inversely proportional to the masses.\n*   `T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = 1 / 2`.\n*   So, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n*   `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   `T1_classical + 2*T1_classical = 3 GeV` => `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)**\n*   We use conservation of total energy and momentum.\n*   **Total Energy Conservation:** `E_total_initial = E_total_final`. The total final energy is the sum of the total energies of the fragments (`E_frag = T + mc^2`).\n    `300 GeV = E_total1 + E_total2`.\n*   **Momentum Conservation:** The fragments have equal and opposite momenta. From the relativistic energy-momentum relation `E_total^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`, we can write:\n    `(pc)^2 = E_total1^2 - (E_1)^2 = E_total2^2 - (E_2)^2`\n*   Substitute `E_total2 = 300 - E_total1` and the rest-mass energies `E_1=198`, `E_2=99`:\n    `E_total1^2 - (198)^2 = (300 - E_total1)^2 - (99)^2`\n    `E_total1^2 - 39204 = (90000 - 600*E_total1 + E_total1^2) - 9801`\n    `-39204 = 80199 - 600*E_total1`\n    `600*E_total1 = 119403`\n    `E_total1 = 199.005 GeV`.\n*   The correct kinetic energy `T1` is the total energy minus the rest-mass energy:\n    `T1_correct = E_total1 - E_1 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**5. Find the Difference**\n*   Difference = `T1_correct - T1_classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   Convert to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n*   Difference = `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
