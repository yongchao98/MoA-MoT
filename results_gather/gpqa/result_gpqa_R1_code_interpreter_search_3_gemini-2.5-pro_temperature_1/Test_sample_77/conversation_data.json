    "This question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Let's derive them from first principles.\n\n### 1. The Retarded Potentials\n\nFor a time-varying charge distribution `ρ(r', t')` and current distribution `J(r', t')`, the general solutions for the scalar potential V and vector potential A in the Lorenz gauge are the retarded potentials:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r'$\n\nHere, `t_r` is the **retarded time**, defined by the condition that the signal, traveling at the speed of light `c`, emitted at time `t_r` from position `r'` reaches the observation point `r` at time `t`.\n$t_r = t - \\dfrac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|}{c}$\n\n### 2. Applying to a Moving Point Charge\n\nFor a single point charge `q` moving along a trajectory `s(t)`, its velocity is `v(t) = d s(t) / dt`. The charge and current densities can be written using the Dirac delta function:\n\n$\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n$\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\nSubstituting these into the retarded potential integrals:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{\\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o q}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{\\vec{v}(t_r) \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r'$\n\nThe key difficulty here is that the retarded time `t_r` itself depends on the integration variable `r'`. A standard procedure to evaluate such integrals is to change the integration variable or, more simply, use a known result from electromagnetism theory. The integral evaluates to:\n\n$\\int G(\\vec{r'}) \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t_r)) d^3r' = \\left[ \\dfrac{G(\\vec{r'})}{1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc}} \\right]_{\\vec{r'} = \\vec{s}(t_r)}$\n\nwhere the quantities in the bracket are all evaluated at the retarded time `t_r` which satisfies the condition $t = t_r + d/c$. In the notation of the problem:\n*   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the position of the charge at the retarded time.\n*   $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$ is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n*   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n*   $d = |\\vec{d}|$ is the distance from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n\n### 3. Evaluating the Scalar Potential (V)\n\nUsing this result with $G(\\vec{r'}) = 1/|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}| = 1/d$:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{1/d}{1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc}} \\right]$\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{1}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc})} = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{1}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\nTo match the format of the options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Vector Potential (A)\n\nSimilarly, for the vector potential, we have $G(\\vec{r'}) = \\vec{v}(t_r)/|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}| = \\vec{v}/d$:\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o q}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{\\vec{v}/d}{1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc}} \\right]$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o q \\vec{v}}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{1}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc})} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o q \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})}$\n\nAgain, multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nComparing our derived expressions with the given options:\n\n*   $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n*   $\\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese perfectly match the expressions in option A. We can also note the relationship between V and A:\n$\\vec{A} = (\\mu_o \\epsilon_o \\vec{v}) V$. Since $c^2 = 1/(\\mu_o \\epsilon_o)$, this becomes $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$, which is a well-known relation for Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\nThe other options are incorrect:\n*   B and C use the non-retarded distance `r` and lack the velocity-dependent correction factor in the denominator, making them valid only for static or quasi-static cases.\n*   D has the incorrect sign in the denominator, which would correspond to advanced potentials (signals arriving before they are sent), which are generally discarded as unphysical.\n\nTherefore, option A correctly states the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) for a moving point charge. These are the well-known Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Let's briefly outline their derivation to confirm the correct choice.\n\n### 1. Retarded Potentials\nThe starting point for time-dependent electromagnetism are the retarded potentials, which are the solutions to Maxwell's equations in the Lorenz gauge:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r'$\n\nHere, the sources (charge density $\\rho$ and current density $\\vec{J}$) are evaluated at the **retarded time** $t_r$, which is the time at which a signal, traveling at speed c, must be emitted from position $\\vec{r'}$ to reach the observer at position $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$.\n$t_r = t - \\dfrac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|}{c}$\n\n### 2. Point Charge Densities\nFor a point charge q moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$ with velocity $\\vec{v}(t) = d\\vec{s}/dt$, the charge and current densities are expressed using Dirac delta functions:\n$\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n$\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\n### 3. Evaluating the Integrals\nSubstituting these densities into the potential integrals is non-trivial because the retarded time $t_r$ depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r'}$. The evaluation of the integral over the delta function yields a correction factor related to the motion of the source during the signal propagation.\n\nThe result of this integration is:\n$\\int \\dfrac{\\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r' = \\left[ \\dfrac{1}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v}(t_r) \\cdot (\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|c})} \\right]$\n\nLet's use the notation from the problem statement:\n*   The position of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$ is $\\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n*   The velocity of the charge at the retarded time is $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$.\n*   The vector from the retarded position to the observation point is $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n*   The magnitude of this vector is $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$.\n*   The retarded time condition is $t - t_r = d/c$.\n\nWith this notation, the denominator term becomes:\n$d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{dc}) = d - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{c} = \\frac{dc - \\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{c}$\n\n### 4. Final Expressions\nPlugging this back into the integral for the **scalar potential V**:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{1}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right] = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{c}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\nFor the **vector potential A**, we perform a similar integration:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{q \\vec{v}(t_r) \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r' = \\dfrac{\\mu_o q \\vec{v}(t_r)}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{1}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o q \\vec{v}}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{c}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\n### 5. Comparison with Options\nLet's compare our results with the given options:\n*   $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n*   $\\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese expressions match Option A exactly.\n\n*   **Option B and C** use the simple Coulomb potential form, which is incorrect as it neglects the retardation effect in the denominator. They are only valid for static charges.\n*   **Option D** has a `+` sign in the denominator, which would correspond to \"advanced potentials\" (effects preceding their causes), which are typically excluded on physical grounds.\n\nTherefore, Option A provides the correct Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. These potentials are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n1.  **Conceptual Basis**: When a charge moves, the electromagnetic field it creates propagates outwards at the speed of light, c. An observer at a point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$ does not \"feel\" the effect of the charge at its current position and time. Instead, the observer feels the effect generated by the charge at an earlier time, called the **retarded time** ($t_r$), from a previous position, $\\vec{s}(t_r)$. The time delay ($t - t_r$) is precisely the time it takes for light to travel the distance $d$ from the charge's past position to the observer, i.e., $t - t_r = d/c$.\n\n2.  **The Retarded Potentials**: The general solutions for V and $\\vec{A}$ for any time-varying source are given by the retarded potential formulas. For a point charge, these integrals simplify. The key result is that the potential is not simply the static Coulomb potential evaluated at the retarded distance. An additional correction factor appears in the denominator due to the motion of the source. This factor accounts for the \"bunching up\" or \"spreading out\" of the potential due to the source moving towards or away from the observer.\n\n3.  **Liénard-Wiechert Formulas**: The resulting potentials are:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c}$\n\n    Where:\n    *   $q$ is the charge.\n    *   $\\vec{v}$ is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$.\n    *   $\\vec{d}$ is the vector from the charge's position at the retarded time, $\\vec{s}(t_r)$, to the observation point $\\vec{r}$. So, $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n    *   $d = |\\vec{d}|$.\n    *   All quantities in the denominator ($\\vec{d}$, $d$, and $\\vec{v}$) are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n4.  **Matching with the Options**: To match the format of the given options, we can manipulate the denominator of the standard formulas by multiplying the numerator and denominator by c:\n    $d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\n    Substituting this back into the potential expressions:\n    *   $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    *   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: These expressions exactly match option A.\n    *   Options B and C are incorrect because they use the static potential form, ignoring the crucial retardation effect in the denominator.\n    *   Option D is incorrect because it has a positive sign in the denominator, which would correspond to an \"advanced potential\" (violating causality) rather than the physical \"retarded potential\".\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) for a moving point charge. This is a classic problem in electromagnetism, and the solutions are the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### Reasoning:\n\n1.  **Retarded Time**: A key concept in electrodynamics is that electromagnetic effects propagate at the finite speed of light, $c$. Therefore, the field measured at a position $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$ is caused by the state of the charge at an earlier time, known as the **retarded time**, $t_r$. This earlier time is determined by the condition that the time elapsed, $t - t_r$, must equal the time it took for the signal to travel the distance $d$ from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observer's position.\n    *   Let $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ be the position of the charge at the retarded time.\n    *   The vector from the charge's retarded position to the field point is $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n    *   The distance is $d = |\\vec{d}|$.\n    *   The retarded time condition is: $t - t_r = \\frac{d}{c}$.\n\n2.  **Liénard-Wiechert Potentials Derivation**: The potentials are found by evaluating the general retarded potential integrals for the specific case of a point charge. The charge and current densities are given by:\n    *   $\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n    *   $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\n    Plugging these into the retarded potential formulas and evaluating the integrals yields the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. A crucial part of the derivation is accounting for the change in volume of the apparent source due to its motion, which introduces a correction factor of $(1 - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} / (dc))^{-1}$.\n\n3.  **The Resulting Formulas**: The standard forms of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c}$\n    where $\\vec{v}$ is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n4.  **Matching with the Given Options**: The expressions in the options are written in a slightly different form.

    "The question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge, which are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### Reasoning and Derivation:\n\n1.  **Retarded Potentials**: The foundation for calculating fields from time-varying sources is the concept of retarded potentials. Since electromagnetic influences travel at the speed of light, $c$, the potential at a field point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$ depends on the state of the source at an earlier, or **retarded time**, $t_r$. The time difference, $t - t_r$, is the time it took for the signal to travel from the source to the field point.\n\n2.  **Source Definitions**:\n    *   Let the trajectory of the point charge $q$ be $\\vec{s}(t)$.\n    *   The position of the charge at the retarded time is $\\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n    *   The velocity of the charge at the retarded time is $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$.\n    *   The vector from the charge's position at the retarded time to the observation point is $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n    *   The distance this signal traveled is $d = |\\vec{d}|$.\n    *   The retarded time condition is therefore $t - t_r = d/c$.\n\n3.  **The Liénard-Wiechert Formulas**: Solving the general retarded potential integrals for a moving point charge yields the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.
