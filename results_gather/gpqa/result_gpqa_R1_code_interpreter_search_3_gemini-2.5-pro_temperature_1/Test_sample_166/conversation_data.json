    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) of a specific Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure.\n*   **State:** `|psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>) / N`\n*   **Parameters:** `phi = -pi/4`, `alpha = 0.5`\n*   **Measure:** `del_b = Tr(rho * ln(rho)) - Tr(tau * ln(tau))`\n    This can be rewritten using the von Neumann entropy `S(x) = -Tr(x * ln(x))`.\n    `del_b = -S(rho) - (-S(tau)) = S(tau) - S(rho)`.\n\n**2. Analyze the State and its Entropy `S(rho)`**\nThe state `|psi>` is a pure quantum state. The density matrix is `rho = |psi><psi|`. For any pure state, the von Neumann entropy `S(rho)` is zero.\nTherefore, the non-Gaussianity measure simplifies to `nG = del_b = S(tau)`.\n\n**3. Define the Reference Gaussian State `tau`**\nThe state `tau` is the reference Gaussian state that has the same first and second moments as the state `rho`. This means we need to calculate the expectation values of the annihilation operator `a` and its combinations for the state `rho`. The entropy `S(tau)` is then calculated from these moments.\n\n**4. Calculate the Moments of `rho`**\nFirst, let's write down the state for the given parameters `phi = -pi/4` and `alpha = 0.5`.\n*   `cos(phi) = cos(-pi/4) = 1/sqrt(2)`\n*   `sin(phi) = sin(-pi/4) = -1/sqrt(2)`\n*   `sin(2*phi) = sin(-pi/2) = -1`\n*   `cos(2*phi) = cos(-pi/2) = 0`\n\nThe normalization constant squared is:\n`N^2 = 1 + sin(2*phi) * exp(-2*alpha^2) = 1 - exp(-2*alpha^2)`\n\nThe state is:\n`|psi> = ( (1/sqrt(2))|alpha> - (1/sqrt(2))|-alpha> ) / N = ( |alpha> - |-alpha> ) / (sqrt(2) * N)`\nThis is a form of the \"odd\" Schrödinger cat state.\n\nNow, we calculate the required expectation values (moments). We use the property `a|beta> = beta|beta>`, where `alpha` is a real number.\n*   **First moment `<a>`:**\n    `<a> = <psi|a|psi>`\n    `a|psi> = (1/(sqrt(2)N)) * (a|alpha> - a|-alpha>) = (1/(sqrt(2)N)) * (alpha|alpha> - (-alpha)|-alpha>) = (alpha/(sqrt(2)N)) * (|alpha> + |-alpha>)`\n    `<psi| = (1/(sqrt(2)N)) * (<alpha| - <-alpha|)`\n    `<a> = (alpha / (2N^2)) * (<alpha| - <-alpha|)(|alpha> + |-alpha>)`\n    `<a> = (alpha / (2N^2)) * (<alpha|alpha> + <alpha|-alpha> - <-alpha|alpha> - <-alpha|-alpha>)`\n    Using `<beta|gamma> = exp(-0.5*|beta|^2 - 0.5*|gamma|^2 + beta*gamma)`, we have `<alpha|alpha> = 1`, `<-alpha|-alpha> = 1`, and `<alpha|-alpha> = <-alpha|alpha> = exp(-2*alpha^2)`.\n    `<a> = (alpha / (2N^2)) * (1 + exp(-2a^2) - exp(-2a^2) - 1) = 0`.\n\n*   **Second moment `<a^2>`:**\n    The operator `a^2` acts on the basis states as `a^2|alpha> = alpha^2|alpha>` and `a^2|-alpha> = alpha^2|-alpha>`. Thus, any superposition of `|alpha>` and `|-alpha>` is an eigenstate of `a^2` with eigenvalue `alpha^2`.\n    `a^2|psi> = alpha^2|psi>`.\n    Therefore, `<a^2> = <psi|a^2|psi> = <psi|alpha^2|psi> = alpha^2 <psi|psi> = alpha^2`.\n\n*   **Mean photon number `<n> = <a_dagger a>`:**\n    `<n> = <psi|a_dagger a|psi>`. This is the norm squared of `a|psi>`.\n    `<n> = || a|psi> ||^2 = || (alpha/(sqrt(2)N)) * (|alpha> + |-alpha>) ||^2`\n    `<n> = (alpha^2 / (2N^2)) * < |alpha> + |-alpha> | |alpha> + |-alpha> >`\n    `<n> = (alpha^2 / (2N^2)) * (<alpha|alpha> + <alpha|-alpha> + <-alpha|alpha> + <-alpha|-alpha>)`\n    `<n> = (alpha^2 / (2N^2)) * (1 + exp(-2a^2) + exp(-2a^2) + 1) = (alpha^2 / (2N^2)) * (2 + 2exp(-2a^2))`\n    `<n> = (alpha^2 * (1 + exp(-2a^2))) / N^2 = alpha^2 * (1 + exp(-2a^2)) / (1 - exp(-2a^2))`\n    This can be written as `<n> = alpha^2 * coth(alpha^2)`.\n\n**5. Calculate the Covariance Matrix (CM) of `rho`**\nThe entropy of the Gaussian state `tau` depends on its covariance matrix `V`, which is the same as for `rho`. The quadrature operators are `q = (a+a_dagger)/sqrt(2)` and `p = (a-a_dagger)/(i*sqrt(2))`.\nThe CM elements `V_ij = <(Delta x_i)(Delta x_j)>` (with symmetrization for `i!=j`) where `Delta x_i = x_i - <x_i>`.\n*   Since `<a> = 0`, we have `<q> = 0` and `<p> = 0`.\n*   The CM is diagonal because `<a^2>` is real.\n*   `V_qq = <q^2> = <(1/2)(a^2 + a_dagger^2 + 2a_dagger a + 1)> = Re(<a^2>) + <n> + 1/2`\n*   `V_pp = <p^2> = <(-1/2)(a^2 + a_dagger^2 - 2a_dagger a - 1)> = -Re(<a^2>) + <n> + 1/2`\n\n**6. Calculate the Entropy `S(tau)`**\nNow, we plug in `alpha = 0.5`.\n*   `alpha^2 = 0.25`\n*   `<a^2> = 0.25`\n*   `<n> = 0.25 * coth(0.25) = 0.25 * ( (e^0.25 + e^-0.25) / (e^0.25 - e^-0.25) )`\n    `e^0.25 approx 1.2840`, `e^-0.25 approx 0.7788`.\n    `<n> approx 0.25 * (2.0628 / 0.5052) approx 0.25 * 4.083 = 1.0208`\n\nCM elements:\n*   `V_qq = 0.25 + 1.0208 + 0.5 = 1.7708`\n*   `V_pp = -0.25 + 1.0208 + 0.5 = 1.2708`\n\nThe entropy `S(tau)` depends on the symplectic eigenvalue `v = sqrt(det(V))`.\n*   `det(V) = V_qq * V_pp = 1.7708 * 1.2708 approx 2.25`. Let's check this analytically.\n    `det(V) = (Re(<a^2>) + <n> + 1/2) * (-Re(<a^2>) + <n> + 1/2)`\n    `= (<n> + 1/2)^2 - (Re(<a^2>))^2 = (a^2 coth(a^2) + 1/2)^2 - (a^2)^2`.\n    With `a^2=0.25`, `<n> = 1.0207459...`.\n    `det(V) = (1.0207459 + 0.5)^2 - 0.25^2 = 1.5207459^2 - 0.0625 = 2.3126 - 0.0625 = 2.2501`.\n    So, `det(V) = 2.25`.\n\nThe symplectic eigenvalue is `v = sqrt(2.25) = 1.5`.\nThe entropy of a single-mode Gaussian state is equivalent to that of a thermal state with `n_th` photons, where `v = n_th + 1/2`.\n*   `n_th = 1.5 - 0.5 = 1.0`.\n\nThe entropy is given by the formula `S = (n_th + 1)ln(n_th + 1) - n_th ln(n_th)`.\n*   `S(tau) = (1+1)ln(1+1) - 1*ln(1) = 2ln(2) - 0 = 2ln(2)`.\n\n**7.

    "To calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) of the Schrödinger cat state, we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Define the State and Parameters:**\n    The state is given by `|psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>) / N`.\n    The given parameters are `phi = -pi/4` and `alpha = 0.5`.\n\n2.  **Simplify the Non-Gaussianity Measure:**\n    The non-Gaussianity is measured by the relative entropy `del_b = S(tau) - S(rho)`.\n    *   `rho` is the density matrix of the state `|psi>`, which is a pure state.

This is known as an odd cat state.\n\n    Now, we calculate the moments:\n    *   **First moment `<a>`:** For an odd cat state, due to symmetry, the expectation value of the field operator `a` is zero. `<a> = 0`.\n    *   **Second moment `<a^2>`:** The state is an eigenstate of `a^2` with eigenvalue `alpha^2`.

    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) of the given Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure.\n\n**1.

The eigenvalue `v` is related to the second moments by the formula:\n*   `v^2 = (<n> + 1/2)^2 - |<a^2>|^2`\n\nThe entropy `S(tau)` is then identical to the entropy of a thermal state with a mean photon number `n_th = v - 1/2`:\n*   `S(tau) = (n_th + 1)ln(n_th + 1) - n_th ln(n_th)`\n\n**5.

    "To calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) of the specified Schrödinger cat state, we follow a well-defined procedure in quantum optics.\n\n**1. Define the Non-Gaussianity Measure**\n\nThe non-Gaussianity is calculated using the relative entropy between the state's density matrix, `rho`, and a reference Gaussian state, `tau`.\n`nG = S(tau) - S(rho)`\nwhere `S(x) = -Tr(x ln(x))` is the von Neumann entropy.\n\n**2. Simplify the Measure for a Pure State**\n\nThe given state `|psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>) / N` is a pure quantum state. For any pure state, the density matrix `rho = |psi><psi|` has an entropy of zero (`S(rho) = 0`).\nTherefore, the non-Gaussianity is simply the entropy of the reference Gaussian state:\n`nG = S(tau)`\n\n**3. Define the Reference Gaussian State `tau`**\n\nThe state `tau` is a Gaussian state that is constructed to have the same first and second statistical moments as `rho`. This means we need to calculate the expectation values `<a>`, `<a^2>`, and `<a†a>` for the state `|psi>`.\n\n**4. Calculate Moments for the Specific State**\n\nWe are given `phi = -pi/4` and `alpha = 0.5`.\n*   For `phi = -pi/4`, the state `|psi>` becomes an \"odd\" cat state: `|psi> ∝ |alpha> - |-alpha>`.\n*   For an odd cat state, the moments are:\n    *   **First Moment `<a>`**: Due to symmetry, `<a> = 0`.\n    *   **Second Moment `<a^2>`**: This state is an eigenstate of `a^2`, so `<a^2> = alpha^2`.\n    *   **Mean Photon Number `<n> = <a†a>`**: The formula for the odd cat state is `<n> = alpha^2 * coth(alpha^2)`.\n\n**5. Calculate the Entropy of the Reference State `S(tau)`**\n\nThe entropy of a single-mode Gaussian state with `<a>=0` is determined by its second moments through a quantity called the symplectic eigenvalue, `v`.\n*   `v^2 = (<n> + 1/2)^2 - |<a^2>|^2`\nThe entropy is then calculated as if it were a thermal state with a mean photon number of `n_th = v - 1/2`:\n*   `S(tau) = (n_th + 1)ln(n_th + 1) - n_th ln(n_th)`\n\n**6. Perform the Numerical Calculation**\n\nLet's plug in `alpha = 0.5`, which gives `alpha^2 = 0.25`:\n*   `<a^2> = 0.25`\n*   `<n> = 0.25 * coth(0.25)`\n*   `coth(0.25) ≈ 4.0827`\n*   `<n> ≈ 0.25 * 4.0827 ≈ 1.0207`\n\nNow, we find `v`:\n*   `v^2 ≈ (1.0207 + 0.5)^2 - (0.25)^2`\n*   `v^2 ≈ (1.5207)^2 - 0.0625`\n*   `v^2 ≈ 2.3125 - 0.0625 = 2.25`\n\nThis gives `v = sqrt(2.25) = 1.5`.\n\nNow, we find `n_th`:\n*   `n_th = v - 0.5 = 1.5 - 0.5 = 1`\n\nFinally, we calculate the entropy `S(tau)`:\n*   `S(tau) = (1 + 1)ln(1 + 1) - 1 * ln(1)`\n*   `S(tau) = 2 * ln(2) - 0 = 2 * ln(2)`\n*   `S(tau) ≈ 2 * 0.6931 = 1.3862`\n\nThe non-Gaussianity `nG` is equal to `S(tau)`.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated non-Gaussianity is approximately 1.386. Comparing this to the options provided:\nA) 1.38\nB) 0.25\nC) 2.48\nD) 0\n\nThe result is best matched by option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
