    "This problem requires us to find the minimum uncertainty in the energy (ΔE) of an electron, given its speed and the uncertainty in its position (Δx).\n\n**1. Identify the relevant physical principles:**\nThe core principle connecting uncertainty in position and momentum is the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**. The position-momentum uncertainty relation is given by:\nΔx ⋅ Δp ≥ ħ / 2\nwhere:\n*   Δx is the uncertainty in position.\n*   Δp is the uncertainty in momentum.\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ = h / 2π ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n\nThe problem asks for the *minimum* uncertainty, so we will use the equality:\nΔp_min = ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx)\n\n**2. Relate uncertainty in energy (ΔE) to uncertainty in momentum (Δp):**\nThe energy (E) of a particle is a function of its momentum (p). For small uncertainties, we can relate ΔE and Δp using calculus:\nΔE ≈ |dE/dp| ⋅ Δp\n\nWe need to find the derivative dE/dp. The relationship between energy and momentum for a particle is given by the relativistic energy-momentum relation (since the electron's speed, v = 2 x 10⁸ m/s, is a significant fraction of the speed of light, c ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s):\nE² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)²\nwhere m₀ is the rest mass of the electron.\n\nDifferentiating both sides with respect to p:\n2E (dE/dp) = 2c²p\ndE/dp = (pc²) / E\n\nWe also know that the total relativistic energy is E = γm₀c² and the relativistic momentum is p = γm₀v, where γ is the Lorentz factor. Substituting these into the expression for dE/dp:\ndE/dp = ( (γm₀v)c² ) / (γm₀c²) = v\n\nThis surprisingly simple result shows that the rate of change of energy with respect to momentum is the particle's velocity. This holds true for both relativistic and non-relativistic cases.\nTherefore, the relationship between the uncertainties is:\nΔE = v ⋅ Δp\n\n**3. Calculate the minimum uncertainty in energy (ΔE_min):**\nNow we can combine the equations from steps 1 and 2:\nΔE_min = v ⋅ Δp_min = v ⋅ (ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx))\n\n**4. Substitute the given values:**\n*   v = 2 x 10⁸ m/s\n*   Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 x 10⁻⁹ m = 1 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n*   ħ ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n\nLet's perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the constants\nh_bar = 1.054571817e-34  # Reduced Planck constant in J.s\nv = 2e8                   # Speed of the electron in m/s\ndelta_x = 0.1e-9          # Uncertainty in position in m\n\n# Calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle\n# delta_p_min = h_bar / (2 * delta_x)\ndelta_p_min = h_bar / (2 * delta_x)\n\n# Calculate the minimum uncertainty in energy\n# delta_E_min = v * delta_p_min\ndelta_E_min = v * delta_p_min\n\n# Print the result in scientific notation\nprint(f\"{delta_E_min:.3e}\")\n```\n executing code...\n```text\n1.055e-16\n```\nThe calculation yields ΔE_min ≈ 1.055 x 10⁻¹⁶ J.\n\n**5. Compare the result with the given options:**\nThe calculated value is approximately 1 x 10⁻¹⁶ J.\nThe options are:\nA) ~10⁻¹⁸ J\nB) ~10⁻¹⁶ J\nC) ~10⁻¹⁷ J\nD) ~10⁻¹⁹ J\n\nOur result, 1.055 x 10⁻¹⁶ J, matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
