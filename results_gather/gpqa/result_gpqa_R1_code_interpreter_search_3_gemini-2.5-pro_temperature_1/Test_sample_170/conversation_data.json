    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the substituents.**\nFirst, we need to classify the substituent on each benzene ring (C6H5-) as either activating or deactivating, and determine its directing effect (ortho/para or meta).\n\n1.  **C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** The methyl group (-CH3) is an activating group and is ortho, para-directing.\n2.  **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** The ester group (-COOC2H5) is a deactivating group and is meta-directing.\n3.  **C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** The chloro group (-Cl) is a deactivating group but is ortho, para-directing (a special case for halogens).\n4.  **C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** The nitro group (-NO2) is a strongly deactivating group and is meta-directing.\n5.  **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** The ethyl group (-C2H5) is an activating group and is ortho, para-directing.\n6.  **C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is a deactivating group and is meta-directing.\n\n**Step 2: Separate the substances into two main categories.**\nBased on the directing effects, we can separate the substances into two groups.\n*   **Meta-directors:** These will produce very little para-isomer. This group includes:\n    *   4) Nitrobenzene (C6H5-NO2)\n    *   2) Ethyl benzoate (C6H5-COOC2H5)\n    *   6) Benzoic acid (C6H5-COOH)\n*   **Ortho, para-directors:** These will produce significant amounts of para-isomer (along with the ortho-isomer). This group includes:\n    *   1) Toluene (C6H5-CH3)\n    *   5) Ethylbenzene (C6H5-C2H5)\n    *   3) Chlorobenzene (C6H5-Cl)\n\nThe final ordered list will have the meta-directors first, followed by the ortho, para-directors.\nOrder: {4, 2, 6} < {1, 5, 3}\n\n**Step 3: Order the meta-directing substances.**\nFor meta-directors, the yield of the para-isomer is very low. The amount of para-product is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of ortho and para isomers.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength for these groups is:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n(Nitro > Carboxylic Acid > Ester)\n\nTherefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be in the reverse order of the deactivating strength:\nYield(para-NO2) < Yield(para-COOH) < Yield(para-COOC2H5)\n\nThis corresponds to the substance numbers:\n4 < 6 < 2\n\n**Step 4: Order the ortho, para-directing substances.**\nFor ortho, para-directors, the distribution between the ortho and para positions depends on a balance of electronic and steric factors. The question asks for the weight fraction of the para-isomer, which is directly proportional to its percentage yield.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH3 (1) and -C2H5 (5):** The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased steric hindrance near the ortho positions makes the para position more accessible for the incoming electrophile (bromine). Therefore, ethylbenzene will produce a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene.\n    *   Yield(para-CH3) < Yield(para-C2H5)\n    *   Order: 1 < 5\n\n*   **Comparing alkyl groups (-CH3, -C2H5) with the chloro group (-Cl) (3):** While halogens are deactivating overall, they direct ortho/para. The high electronegativity of chlorine (inductive effect, -I) deactivates all positions, but the effect is strongest at the closest positions (ortho). The resonance effect (+R), which directs to the ortho and para positions, is less attenuated at the para position. This combination often leads to a high preference for the para position for halogens compared to alkyl groups. Published data for bromination confirms this trend.\n    *   Yield(para-Alkyls) < Yield(para-Cl)\n    *   Order: (1, 5) < 3\n\nCombining the findings for the ortho, para-directors, we get the order of increasing para-isomer yield:\n1 < 5 < 3\n\n**Step 5: Combine the order of both groups.**\nNow, we combine the ordered lists from Step 3 and Step 4.\n\nThe meta-directors (lowest para yield) come first:\n4 < 6 < 2\n\nFollowed by the ortho, para-directors:\n1 < 5 < 3\n\nThe complete order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3\n\nThis sequence matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here's a step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Reaction and the Goal**\nThe reaction is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a series of monosubstituted benzene rings. The goal is to arrange these substances in order of *increasing* weight fraction of the *para-isomer* yield. The weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the para product.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents**\nWe need to classify each substituent on the benzene ring based on its electronic effect (activating or deactivating) and its directing effect (ortho/para-directing or meta-directing).\n\n1.  **C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** The -CH3 (methyl) group is an alkyl group. It is electron-donating through induction and hyperconjugation.\n    *   Effect: Activating\n    *   Director: Ortho, para-directing\n\n2.  **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** The -COOC2H5 (ester) group has a carbonyl adjacent to the ring. It is strongly electron-withdrawing through resonance.\n    *   Effect: Deactivating\n    *   Director: Meta-directing\n\n3.  **C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** The -Cl (chloro) group is a halogen. It is electron-withdrawing by induction but electron-donating by resonance. The inductive effect dominates, making it deactivating overall. However, resonance directs the incoming electrophile.\n    *   Effect: Deactivating\n    *   Director: Ortho, para-directing\n\n4.  **C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** The -NO2 (nitro) group is very strongly electron-withdrawing by both induction and resonance.\n    *   Effect: Strongly deactivating\n    *   Director: Meta-directing\n\n5.  **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** The -C2H5 (ethyl) group is an alkyl group, similar to methyl but slightly more activating and bulkier.\n    *   Effect: Activating\n    *   Director: Ortho, para-directing\n\n6.  **C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** The -COOH (carboxylic acid) group has a carbonyl adjacent to the ring. It is electron-withdrawing.\n    *   Effect: Deactivating\n    *   Director: Meta-directing\n\n**Step 3: Separate Substances into Meta- and Ortho/Para-Directing Groups**\nThe yield of the para-isomer will be very low for meta-directors and much higher for ortho, para-directors. This creates a natural division in our list.\n\n*   **Low para yield (Meta-directors):**\n    *   4) C6H5-NO2\n    *   6) C6H5-COOH\n    *   2) C6H5-COOC2H5\n*   **High para yield (Ortho, para-directors):**\n    *   1) C6H5-CH3\n    *   5) C6H5-C2H5\n    *   3) C6H5-Cl\n\nThe final ordered list will have the meta-directors first, followed by the ortho, para-directors.\n\n**Step 4: Order the Meta-Directing Substances**\nFor meta-directors, the yield of the para-isomer (a minor product) is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of ortho and para isomers. The order of deactivating strength for these groups is well-established:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5 (Nitro > Carboxylic Acid > Ester)\n\nTherefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be in the reverse order of deactivating strength:\nYield(para-NO2) < Yield(para-COOH) < Yield(para-COOC2H5)\nThis corresponds to the substance numbers: **4 < 6 < 2**\n\n**Step 5: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances**\nFor ortho, para-directors, the distribution between the ortho and para positions depends on a balance of electronic and steric factors. A higher yield of the para-isomer is favored by factors that disfavor the ortho-isomers.\n\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** A bulkier substituent will block the two adjacent ortho positions, making the distant para position more accessible to the incoming electrophile (bromine).\n*   **Electronic Effects:** The electronic properties of the substituent can also influence the ortho/para ratio.\n\nLet's compare the groups: -CH3, -C2H5, and -Cl.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH3 (1) vs. -C2H5 (5):** The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased steric hindrance near the ortho positions leads to a greater preference for substitution at the para position. Therefore, ethylbenzene will produce a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene.\n    *   Order of increasing para yield: **1 < 5**\n\n*   **Comparing Alkyl Groups vs. -Cl (3):** The chloro group is deactivating overall due to its strong inductive effect (-I), but its resonance effect (+R) directs ortho/para. The strong -I effect deactivates the ortho positions more strongly than the para position. This electronic factor, combined with moderate steric bulk, makes halogens highly para-selective. In many cases, this electronic preference for the para position is stronger than the steric effect of even moderately sized alkyl groups. Textbooks often present the para-selectivity of halogens as being very high. Following this principle, we can place chlorobenzene as having a higher para yield than both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n    *   Order of increasing para yield: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\n**Step 6: Combine the Orders**\nNow, we combine the ordered list of meta-directors with the ordered list of ortho, para-directors.\n\n*   Meta-directors order: 4 < 6 < 2\n*   Ortho, para-directors order: 1 < 5 < 3\n\nCombining them gives the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is a detailed step-by-step thinking process to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Chemical Principle**\nThe question asks to order substances based on the yield of the *para-isomer* in an electrophilic substitution reaction (bromination). The product distribution in electrophilic aromatic substitution is governed by the nature of the substituent already present on the benzene ring. Substituents can be classified based on two properties:\n1.  **Activating/Deactivating:** Whether they make the ring more or less reactive than benzene.\n2.  **Directing Effect:** Where they direct the incoming electrophile (ortho/para positions or meta position).\n\nThe key to this problem is to understand the factors that influence the ratio of para-isomer to other isomers (ortho and meta).\n\n**Step 2: Classify Each Substituent**\nLet's analyze each of the six substances:\n\n*   **1) C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** The methyl group (-CH3) is an alkyl group. It is electron-donating via induction and hyperconjugation.\n    *   **Effect:** Activating\n    *   **Director:** Ortho, para-directing\n\n*   **2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** The ester group (-COOC2H5) is electron-withdrawing due to the resonance of the carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   **Effect:** Deactivating\n    *   **Director:** Meta-directing\n\n*   **3) C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** The chloro group (-Cl) is a halogen. It is electron-withdrawing via induction (due to high electronegativity) but electron-donating via resonance (lone pairs). The inductive effect is stronger, making it deactivating overall. However, the resonance directs the substitution.\n    *   **Effect:** Deactivating\n    *   **Director:** Ortho, para-directing\n\n*   **4) C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** The nitro group (-NO2) is one of the strongest electron-withdrawing groups by both induction and resonance.\n    *   **Effect:** Strongly Deactivating\n    *   **Director:** Meta-directing\n\n*   **5) C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** The ethyl group (-C2H5) is an alkyl group, similar to methyl but slightly bulkier.\n    *   **Effect:** Activating\n    *   **Director:** Ortho, para-directing\n\n*   **6) C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is electron-withdrawing due to the carbonyl group.\n    *   **Effect:** Deactivating\n    *   **Director:** Meta-directing\n\n**Step 3: Separate into Two Major Groups**\nWe can immediately divide the substances into two groups based on their directing effects.\n*   **Meta-directors:** These will produce very little ortho and para product. Their para-isomer yield will be the lowest. This group includes:\n    *   4) C6H5-NO2\n    *   6) C6H5-COOH\n    *   2) C6H5-COOC2H5\n*   **Ortho, para-directors:** These will produce significant amounts of ortho and para products. Their para-isomer yield will be the highest. This group includes:\n    *   3) C6H5-Cl\n    *   1) C6H5-CH3\n    *   5) C6H5-C2H5\n\nTherefore, the final ordered list will have the form {meta-directors} < {ortho, para-directors}.\n\n**Step 4: Order the Meta-Directing Group**\nWithin the meta-directing group, the yield of the minor para-isomer is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A more strongly deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, meaning it produces even less para product. The order of deactivating strength is:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n(Nitro is stronger than carboxylic acid, which is stronger than ester)\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse:\nYield(para-NO2) < Yield(para-COOH) < Yield(para-COOC2H5)\nThis corresponds to the substance order: **4 < 6 < 2**\n\n**Step 5: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Group**\nWithin the ortho, para-directing group, the ratio of para to ortho product is determined by steric and electronic factors.\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** A larger substituent will sterically block the adjacent ortho positions, favoring substitution at the more accessible para position.\n*   **Electronic Factors:** For halogens, the strong inductive effect deactivates the nearby ortho positions more than the distant para position, leading to a high para-selectivity.\n\nLet's compare them:\n*   **-CH3 (1) vs. -C2H5 (5):** The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased bulk hinders attack at the ortho positions, making the para product more favorable for ethylbenzene compared to toluene. So, **1 < 5**.\n*   **Alkyl groups (1, 5) vs. -Cl (3):** The chloro group, while deactivating overall, is known to be highly para-directing due to the combination of its strong inductive effect (which disfavors the ortho position) and its resonance effect. This electronic preference generally leads to a higher para/ortho ratio for halogens than for simple alkyl groups. Thus, chlorobenzene gives a higher percentage of the para isomer than both toluene and ethylbenzene. So, **(1, 5) < 3**.\n\nCombining these observations, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is:\nToluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene\nThis corresponds to the substance order: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\n**Step 6: Combine the Two Groups**\nNow, we assemble the final order by placing the ordered meta-directing group before the ordered ortho, para-directing group:\n\n{4 < 6 < 2} < {1 < 5 < 3}\n\nThe complete order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis sequence matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here's a detailed, step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Reaction and the Goal**\nThe problem involves an electrophilic substitution reaction (bromination) on six different monosubstituted benzene rings. The goal is to arrange these substances in order of *increasing* weight fraction of the *para-isomer* yield. The weight fraction is directly proportional to the percentage yield of the para product.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents**\nThe key to solving this problem lies in understanding how each substituent affects the benzene ring's reactivity and directs the incoming electrophile (bromine).\n\n1.  **C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** The -CH3 group is an alkyl group. It is electron-donating.\n    *   **Effect:** Activating\n    *   **Director:** Ortho, para-directing\n\n2.  **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** The -COOC2H5 group has a carbonyl (C=O) attached to the ring, making it electron-withdrawing.\n    *   **Effect:** Deactivating\n    *   **Director:** Meta-directing\n\n3.  **C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** The -Cl group is a halogen. It is deactivating due to its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect, but its lone pairs direct the substitution via resonance.\n    *   **Effect:** Deactivating\n    *   **Director:** Ortho, para-directing\n\n4.  **C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** The -NO2 group is a very strong electron-withdrawing group.\n    *   **Effect:** Strongly Deactivating\n    *   **Director:** Meta-directing\n\n5.  **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** The -C2H5 group is an alkyl group, similar to methyl but larger.\n    *   **Effect:** Activating\n    *   **Director:** Ortho, para-directing\n\n6.  **C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** The -COOH group is electron-withdrawing due to the carbonyl group.\n    *   **Effect:** Deactivating\n    *   **Director:** Meta-directing\n\n**Step 3: Separate into Meta- and Ortho/Para-Directing Groups**\nThe yield of the para-isomer will be very low for meta-directors and much higher for ortho, para-directors. This creates a clear division.\n\n*   **Low para yield (Meta-directors):** These will come first in the ordered list.\n    *   4) Nitrobenzene (C6H5-NO2)\n    *   6) Benzoic acid (C6H5-COOH)\n    *   2) Ethyl benzoate (C6H5-COOC2H5)\n*   **High para yield (Ortho, para-directors):** These will come last in the ordered list.\n    *   1) Toluene (C6H5-CH3)\n    *   5) Ethylbenzene (C6H5-C2H5)\n    *   3) Chlorobenzene (C6H5-Cl)\n\nThe final order will have the structure: {meta-directors} < {ortho, para-directors}.\n\n**Step 4: Order the Meta-Directing Substances**\nFor meta-directors, the para-isomer is a minor product. The yield of this minor product is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the group. A more powerful deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para isomer.\nThe established order of deactivating strength is:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n\nTherefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be in the reverse order:\nYield(para-NO2) < Yield(para-COOH) < Yield(para-COOC2H5)\nThis corresponds to the substance order: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 5: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances**\nFor this group, the para-isomer is a major product. The ratio of para to ortho product depends mainly on steric hindrance. A larger substituent blocks the adjacent ortho positions, favoring substitution at the more accessible para position.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH3 (1) vs. -C2H5 (5):** The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased steric hindrance disfavors ortho-substitution, leading to a higher proportion of the para-isomer for ethylbenzene compared to toluene. Thus, the para yield for Toluene is less than for Ethylbenzene.\n    *   Order: **1 < 5**\n\n*   **Comparing Alkyl Groups (1, 5) vs. -Cl (3):** The chloro group, while deactivating, is highly para-selective. This is due to its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect, which is felt more strongly at the closer ortho positions than at the distant para position, thus disfavoring ortho attack. Experimental data confirms this: the bromination of chlorobenzene gives about 89% para-isomer, while the bromination of toluene gives about 67% para-isomer. The para yield for ethylbenzene is higher than for toluene but still less than for chlorobenzene.\n    *   Order: **(1, 5) < 3**\n\nCombining these findings, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is:\nToluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene\nThis corresponds to the substance order: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 6: Combine the Orders into the Final Answer**\nNow, we assemble the final order by joining the two sorted groups:\n*   Meta-directors order: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Ortho, para-directors order: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThe complete sequence for increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the substituents based on their directing effects.**\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution, the substituent already on the benzene ring determines where the new group will be added. We can classify them into two main categories:\n*   **Ortho, para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (bromine) to the positions ortho and para to themselves. They typically have lone pairs on the atom attached to the ring or are alkyl groups.\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the positions meta to themselves. They typically have a partial or full positive charge on the atom attached to the ring.\n\nLet's classify each substance:\n1.  **C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** -CH3 is an alkyl group. It is an **ortho, para-director**.\n2.  **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** -COOC2H5 is an ester group. The carbonyl carbon has a partial positive charge, making it electron-withdrawing. It is a **meta-director**.\n3.  **C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** -Cl is a halogen. It is an **ortho, para-director**.\n4.  **C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** -NO2 is a strongly electron-withdrawing group. It is a **meta-director**.\n5.  **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** -C2H5 is an alkyl group. It is an **ortho, para-director**.\n6.  **C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** -COOH is a carboxylic acid group. The carbonyl carbon has a partial positive charge. It is a **meta-director**.\n\n**Step 2: Separate the substances into two groups.**\nBased on the directing effects, we can form two groups. The meta-directors will have a very low yield of the para-isomer, while the ortho, para-directors will have a significantly higher yield.\n*   **Low Para Yield Group (Meta-directors):**\n    *   4) Nitrobenzene (C6H5-NO2)\n    *   6) Benzoic acid (C6H5-COOH)\n    *   2) Ethyl benzoate (C6H5-COOC2H5)\n*   **High Para Yield Group (Ortho, para-directors):**\n    *   1) Toluene (C6H5-CH3)\n    *   5) Ethylbenzene (C6H5-C2H5)\n    *   3) Chlorobenzene (C6H5-Cl)\n\nThe final correct sequence must have the meta-directors first, followed by the ortho, para-directors.\n\n**Step 3: Order the meta-directing substances.**\nFor meta-directors, the para-isomer is a minor product. The yield of this minor product is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para isomer. The established order of deactivating strength is:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n(Nitro > Carboxylic Acid > Ester)\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse:\nYield(para-NO2) < Yield(para-COOH) < Yield(para-COOC2H5)\nThis corresponds to the substance order: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 4: Order the ortho, para-directing substances.**\nFor this group, the para-isomer is a major product. The ratio of para to ortho product depends mainly on steric hindrance and electronic factors.\n*   **Comparing -CH3 (1) vs. -C2H5 (5):** The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased size blocks the adjacent ortho positions, making the less hindered para position a more likely site for substitution. Therefore, ethylbenzene gives a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene. This gives us the order: **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing Alkyl Groups (1, 5) vs. -Cl (3):** The chloro group, while deactivating overall, is known to be highly para-selective. This is because its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I) deactivates the nearby ortho positions more strongly than the distant para position. This electronic factor typically results in a higher para/ortho ratio for halogens compared to alkyl groups. Thus, chlorobenzene will produce the highest percentage of para-isomer in this group. This gives us the order: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the orders into the final answer.**\nBy combining the results from Steps 3 and 4, we place the ordered meta-directing group before the ordered ortho, para-directing group.\n\n*   Meta-directors order: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Ortho, para-directors order: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThe complete sequence for increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"

Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\n\nIf you lack the related knowledge, you can use the Google Search Tool to search the web and get the information.\nYou can call a search query with the format of <search>your search query</search>, e.g., <search>Who is the current president of US?</search>. The searched results will be returned between <information> and </information>.\nOnce the search query is complete, stop the generation. Then, the search platform will return the searched results.\n\nIf you need to search the web, do not generate code in the same response. Vice versa. You can also solve the question without code and searching, just by your textual reasoning.\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code or search queries to solve the problem.\n\n    question: Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed):\n1) ะก6H5-CH3\n2) C6H5-COOC2H5\n3) C6H5-Cl\n4) C6H5-NO2\n5) C6H5-C2H5\n6) C6H5-COOH\nC6H5 - means benzene ring\nArrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer.\n\nA) 6<2<4<5<1<3\nB) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nC) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nD) 4<2<6<3<1<5\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n",
