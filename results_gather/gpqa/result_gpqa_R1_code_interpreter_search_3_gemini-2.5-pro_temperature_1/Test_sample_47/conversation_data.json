    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br2)**\n*   **Reaction:** This is the alpha-bromination of a ketone. In this reaction, one of the alpha-hydrogens (a hydrogen on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) is replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Starting Material:** Cyclohexanone is a symmetrical ketone. Both alpha-positions (C2 and C6) are chemically equivalent.\n*   **Product 1:** The product is **2-bromocyclohexanone**.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n*   **Reaction:** This is a classic example of the **Favorskii rearrangement**. An alpha-halo ketone with an abstractable proton on the other alpha-carbon, when treated with a strong base like sodium hydroxide, undergoes a ring contraction.\n*   **Mechanism Outline:**\n    1.  The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) removes a proton from the C6 position of 2-bromocyclohexanone to form an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate undergoes an intramolecular S_N2 reaction, where the carbanion at C6 attacks C2, displacing the bromide ion. This forms a bicyclic intermediate, bicyclo[3.1.0]hexan-2-one.\n    3.  The hydroxide ion then attacks the carbonyl carbon of the bicyclic ketone.\n    4.  The resulting tetrahedral intermediate collapses, and the strained cyclopropane ring opens. This results in the formation of a cyclopentanecarboxylate salt.\n    5.  Upon acidic workup (which is implied in such sequences), the salt is protonated.\n*   **Product 2:** The product is **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine**\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) is the chlorinating agent, and pyridine is used as a base to neutralize the HCl gas produced during the reaction.\n*   **Product 3:** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is converted to an acid chloride group (-COCl). The product is **cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)3)**\n*   **Reaction:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to the corresponding alcohol. This is a well-known selective reduction.\n*   **Product 4:** The acid chloride group (-COCl) is reduced to an aldehyde group (-CHO). The final product is **cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde**.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde**\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde. We do this by analyzing the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclopentane ring is attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry (a Cₛ plane). This plane passes through the aldehyde group (CHO), the carbon it's attached to (C1), and bisects the opposite C-C bond (the C3-C4 bond).\n*   **Counting the distinct hydrogens:**\n    1.  **Aldehyde Hydrogen:** The hydrogen in the -CHO group. It lies on the plane of symmetry and is unique. (1 type)\n    2.  **C1 Hydrogen:** The hydrogen on the carbon atom of the ring that is bonded to the aldehyde group. This hydrogen also lies on the plane of symmetry and is unique. (1 type)\n    3.  **C2 and C5 Hydrogens:** The C2 and C5 positions are equivalent due to reflection through the plane of symmetry. However, the two hydrogens on C2 are not equivalent to each other. They are diastereotopic because C1 is a stereocenter. One hydrogen is *cis* to the aldehyde group and the other is *trans*. The *cis* hydrogen on C2 is equivalent to the *cis* hydrogen on C5. The *trans* hydrogen on C2 is equivalent to the *trans* hydrogen on C5. This gives two distinct types of hydrogens for these four positions. (2 types)\n    4.  **C3 and C4 Hydrogens:** Similarly, the C3 and C4 positions are equivalent by symmetry. The two hydrogens on C3 are diastereotopic. The *cis*-like hydrogen on C3 is equivalent to the *cis*-like hydrogen on C4, and the *trans*-like hydrogen on C3 is equivalent to the *trans*-like hydrogen on C4. This gives another two distinct types of hydrogens. (2 types)\n\n**Total Count:**\n*   Type 1: Aldehyde H (1 proton)\n*   Type 2: C1 H (1 proton)\n*   Type 3: C2/C5 H's (2 protons)\n*   Type 4: C2/C5 H's (2 protons)\n*   Type 5: C3/C4 H's (2 protons)\n*   Type 6: C3/C4 H's (2 protons)\n\nSumming these up, there are 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **6** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "**Step-by-step Synthesis Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Cyclohexanone + Bromine (Br₂) → Product 1:**\n    *   This reaction is the α-bromination of a ketone. Cyclohexanone is a symmetrical ketone, meaning the α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group) are equivalent. One hydrogen atom on an α-carbon is replaced by a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1 is 2-bromocyclohexanone.**\n\n2.  **Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) + NaOH, heat → Product 2:**\n    *   This is a classic organic reaction known as the **Favorskii rearrangement**. When an α-halo ketone with an abstractable proton on the other α-carbon is treated with a strong base (like NaOH), it undergoes a ring contraction.\n    *   The mechanism involves the formation of a bicyclic intermediate (bicyclo[3.1.0]hexan-2-one), which is then attacked by the hydroxide ion. The ring system opens up to form a more stable carboxylate salt on a smaller ring.\n    *   The six-membered cyclohexanone ring contracts to a five-membered cyclopentane ring. The carbonyl group and the bromine atom are effectively replaced by a carboxylic acid group.\n    *   **Product 2 is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.**\n\n3.  **Product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) + Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) / Pyridine → Product 3:**\n    *   This is a standard procedure for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) is the chlorinating agent that replaces the -OH group with a -Cl atom. Pyridine is a base used to neutralize the HCl gas produced during the reaction.\n    *   **Product 3 is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.**\n\n4.  **Product 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)₃) → Product 4:**\n    *   Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a mild and sterically hindered reducing agent. It is specifically used for the selective reduction of acid chlorides to aldehydes. It is not strong enough to reduce the aldehyde further to an alcohol.\n    *   **Product 4 is cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde.**\n\n**Analysis of Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde):**\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product, cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde. We can do this by examining the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:** The molecule consists of a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (C-H and C=O bonds), the ring carbon it's attached to (C1), and the hydrogen on C1. This plane bisects the bond between C3 and C4 of the ring.\n*   **Chemically Distinct Hydrogens:** Hydrogen atoms are chemically distinct if they are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation (like reflection or rotation).\n\nLet's count the sets of equivalent hydrogens:\n\n1.  **The aldehyde hydrogen (-CHO):** This hydrogen is unique as it's the only one in an aldehyde functional group. It lies on the plane of symmetry. (1 type)\n2.  **The hydrogen on C1:** This is the hydrogen on the carbon atom of the ring that is bonded to the aldehyde group. It also lies on the plane of symmetry and is unique. (1 type)\n3.  **The hydrogens on C2 and C5:** Due to the plane of symmetry, the C2 position is equivalent to the C5 position. However, the two hydrogens on C2 are not equivalent to each other (they are diastereotopic because C1 is a chiral center). One hydrogen is in a different chemical environment than the other. The same applies to C5. The \"upper\" hydrogen on C2 is equivalent to the \"upper\" hydrogen on C5, and the \"lower\" hydrogen on C2 is equivalent to the \"lower\" hydrogen on C5. This gives two distinct sets of hydrogens for these four positions. (2 types)\n4.  **The hydrogens on C3 and C4:** Similarly, the C3 position is equivalent to the C4 position. The two hydrogens on C3 are diastereotopic. This gives another two distinct sets of hydrogens for these four positions. (2 types)\n\n**Total Count:**\n*   Type 1: Aldehyde H (1 proton)\n*   Type 2: C1 methine H (1 proton)\n*   Type 3 & 4: C2/C5 methylene H's (4 protons total)\n*   Type 5 & 6: C3/C4 methylene H's (4 protons total)\n\nSumming the types of distinct hydrogens: 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **6**.\n\nTherefore, there are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4.\n\n<<<C>>>",
