    "*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n    Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if its molecule is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is the presence of a chiral center (an atom, typically carbon, bonded to four different groups). However, chirality can also arise from other structural features, such as restricted rotation in certain molecules (atropisomerism). A molecule is achiral (and therefore not optically active) if it possesses an element of symmetry, such as a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n*   **Analyzing the Compounds**\n\n    1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:\n        *   **Structure**: This is a biphenyl derivative. The two phenyl rings are connected by a single C-C bond.\n        *   **Chirality**: The molecule has bulky substituents (nitro groups, -NO2, and dimethyl carboxylate groups, -COOCH3) at all four ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6'). These bulky groups sterically hinder the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restricted rotation forces the rings to be non-coplanar. The resulting molecule does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, making it chiral. This type of chirality is known as atropisomerism. Therefore, this compound will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n    2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n        *   **Structure**: The chemical formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. It is also known as methyl lactate.\n        *   **Chirality**: Let's examine carbon-2 (the carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl group). This carbon is attached to four different groups:\n            1.  a hydrogen atom (-H)\n            2.  a hydroxyl group (-OH)\n            3.  a methyl group (-CH3)\n            4.  a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n        *   Since carbon-2 is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n    3.  **benzophenone**:\n        *   **Structure**: The chemical formula is (C6H5)2CO. A central carbonyl group (C=O) is bonded to two phenyl rings.\n        *   **Chirality**: The molecule is symmetrical. It has a plane of symmetry that passes through the carbon and oxygen atoms of the carbonyl group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. The presence of a plane of symmetry means the molecule is achiral and superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, benzophenone does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n    4.  **dimethyl fumarate**:\n        *   **Structure**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans* isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. Its structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the two -COOCH3 groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n        *   **Chirality**: The molecule is planar. It has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and also a center of inversion (or center of symmetry) located at the midpoint of the carbon-carbon double bond. The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n    Based on the analysis, only compound 1 (due to atropisomerism) and compound 2 (due to a chiral center) are chiral and will show optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and will not.\n\nThus, the correct option includes only 1 and 2.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This question asks to identify which of the given compounds exhibit optical isomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if its molecule is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Let's analyze each compound.\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl molecule. The two phenyl rings are linked by a single C-C bond. The positions ortho to this bond (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are all substituted with large groups: two nitro groups (-NO2) and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3).\n*   **Chirality Analysis:** The bulky substituents at the ortho positions cause significant steric hindrance, which prevents free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restricted rotation forces the two rings to be non-coplanar (twisted relative to each other). The resulting molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. A molecule that is non-planar and lacks these symmetry elements is chiral. This specific type of chirality, arising from hindered rotation, is called atropisomerism.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the molecule is chiral, it will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\n*   **Structure:** The structure can be written as CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. This is an ester also known as methyl lactate.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:** We need to check for chiral centers. A chiral center is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group):\n    *   Group 1: -H (a hydrogen atom)\n    *   Group 2: -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n    *   Group 3: -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n    *   Group 4: -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n    Since this carbon atom is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center.\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n\n*   **Structure:** The formula is (C₆H₅)₂CO. It consists of a central carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two phenyl rings.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:** We look for elements of symmetry. The molecule has a C₂ axis of rotation along the C=O bond. More importantly, it possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the carbonyl carbon and oxygen atoms and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a plane of symmetry means the molecule is achiral and superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, benzophenone does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans* isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The two ester groups (-COOCH₃) are on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is planar. This molecular plane itself acts as a plane of symmetry. Additionally, there is a center of inversion (a point of symmetry) at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since dimethyl fumarate is achiral, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (atropisomerism).\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral center).\n*   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral, has a plane of symmetry).\n*   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral, has a plane and center of symmetry).\n\nTherefore, only compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "To determine which of the given compounds show optical isomerism, we need to assess whether their molecules are chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This typically occurs when a molecule lacks any elements of symmetry, such as a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nLet's analyze each molecule:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule is a biphenyl derivative. The two phenyl rings are connected by a single bond. Usually, there is free rotation around this bond. However, this molecule has large, bulky substituents (nitro groups and ester groups) at all four positions ortho to the connecting bond (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). These bulky groups sterically hinder each other, preventing the rings from rotating freely and becoming coplanar. This restricted rotation forces the molecule into a stable, twisted conformation that is not planar. This twisted structure lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral. This type of chirality due to hindered rotation is known as **atropisomerism**. Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2, the one bonded to the -OH group). This carbon atom is bonded to four different groups:\n    *   A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    *   A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    *   A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    *   A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon is bonded to four distinct substituents, it is a **chiral center**. A molecule containing a single chiral center is always chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The structure is (C₆H₅)₂CO. This molecule consists of a carbonyl group attached to two identical phenyl rings. The molecule possesses a **plane of symmetry** that passes through the carbon and oxygen atoms of the carbonyl group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. The presence of this plane of symmetry means the molecule is achiral and cannot be optically active.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, the *trans* isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is planar due to the C=C double bond. The molecule has both a **plane of symmetry** (the plane of the molecule itself) and a **center of inversion** (at the midpoint of the double bond). The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral, so it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nCompounds 1 and 2 are chiral and will show optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and will not.\n\nTherefore, the correct option includes compounds 1 and 2.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "To determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we must identify which molecules are chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image.
