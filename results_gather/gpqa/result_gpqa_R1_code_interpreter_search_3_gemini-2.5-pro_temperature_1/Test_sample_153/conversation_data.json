    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion (M⁺):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotopes.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M⁺+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 is two mass units heavier. The relative intensity ratio of the M⁺ peak (100%) to the M⁺+2 peak (32%) is approximately 3:1. This is the characteristic isotopic signature for a molecule containing **one chlorine atom** (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl ≈ 75% and ³⁷Cl ≈ 25%).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic, broad absorption band for the O-H stretch of a **carboxylic acid** (-COOH). The broadness is caused by extensive hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When seen in conjunction with the very broad O-H peak, it confirms the presence of a **carboxylic acid** functional group.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The molecule is a carboxylic acid.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is highly diagnostic for the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid**. The integration of 1H confirms it is a single proton.\n*   **Aromatic Region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm):** Both signals are in the aromatic region of the spectrum.\n    *   The pattern consists of two doublets, each integrating to 2H. This symmetry (two sets of two equivalent protons) is a classic indicator of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   The protons at 8.02 ppm are more deshielded (further downfield) than those at 7.72 ppm. This is consistent with them being ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the protons at 7.72 ppm are ortho to the chlorine atom.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The molecule is a para-substituted aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n**4. Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring with a -COOH group and a -Cl atom in the para (1,4) positions.\n    *   **Molecular Weight:** C₇H₅³⁵ClO₂ = 156 g/mol. (Matches MS)\n    *   **Functional Groups:** It is a carboxylic acid. (Matches IR and the 11.0 ppm NMR signal)\n    *   **Substitution Pattern:** It is a para-substituted benzene ring. (Matches the aromatic NMR pattern)\n    *   **This is a perfect match for all the data.**\n\n*   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an ortho-substituted isomer. Its aromatic ¹H NMR spectrum would be much more complex, showing four distinct signals for the four non-equivalent aromatic protons. This does not match the observed simple two-doublet pattern.\n\n*   **C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. It would lack the very broad O-H IR band and the NMR signal at 11.0 ppm. Instead, it would show an aldehyde proton signal around 9-10 ppm.\n\n*   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is an acid chloride. It lacks an O-H group, so it would not have the broad IR peak or the NMR signal at 11.0 ppm. Its C=O IR stretch would also be at a significantly higher frequency (around 1780 cm⁻¹).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of all spectral data, the unidentified compound is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion (M⁺):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotopes.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M⁺+2):** There is a peak at m/z = 158, which is two mass units heavier than the molecular ion. The relative intensity ratio of the M⁺ peak (100%) to the M⁺+2 peak (32%) is approximately 3:1. This is a characteristic isotopic pattern for a molecule containing **one chlorine atom**, due to the natural abundance of the isotopes ³⁵Cl (≈75%) and ³⁷Cl (≈25%).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic, broad absorption band for the O-H stretch of a **carboxylic acid** (-COOH). The extreme broadness is caused by hydrogen bonding between molecules.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When seen in conjunction with the very broad O-H peak, it strongly confirms the presence of a **carboxylic acid** functional group.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The molecule is a carboxylic acid.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is highly diagnostic for the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid**. The integration of 1H confirms it is a single proton, and it appears as a singlet because it exchanges rapidly and doesn't couple.\n*   **Aromatic Region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm):**\n    *   Both signals are in the aromatic region of the spectrum, indicating a substituted benzene ring.\n    *   The pattern consists of two distinct doublets, each integrating to 2H. This symmetry (two sets of two equivalent protons) is a classic indicator of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   The protons at 8.02 ppm are more deshielded (further downfield) than those at 7.72 ppm. This is consistent with them being *ortho* to the strongly electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The molecule contains a para-disubstituted benzene ring and a carboxylic acid proton.\n\n**4. Synthesizing the Data and Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   The data points to a molecule with a molecular weight of 156, containing one chlorine atom, a carboxylic acid group, and a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   Let's examine the choices:\n    *   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This structure has a carboxylic acid and a chlorine atom in a para (1,4) arrangement on a benzene ring. Its molecular formula is C₇H₅ClO₂, and its molecular weight with ³⁵Cl is 156 g/mol. This structure perfectly matches all the MS, IR, and ¹H NMR data.\n    *   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho*-substituted isomer. Its four aromatic protons would not be symmetrical and would produce a more complex ¹H NMR spectrum, not two simple doublets.\n    *   **C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. It would lack the very broad O-H IR band and the NMR signal at 11.0 ppm.\n    *   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is an acid chloride. It lacks an O-H group, so it would not have the broad IR peak or the NMR signal at 11.0 ppm.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nThe combined spectral evidence overwhelmingly supports the structure of 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n*   The molecular ion peak (M⁺) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the molecule with the most abundant isotopes.\n*   There is another peak at m/z = 158, which is two mass units heavier than the M⁺ peak. The ratio of the intensities of these peaks is M⁺ (100%) to M⁺+2 (32%), which is approximately 3:1.\n*   This 3:1 ratio for M⁺ and M⁺+2 peaks is the characteristic isotopic signature for a molecule containing **one chlorine atom**. This is due to the natural abundance of chlorine's isotopes: ³⁵Cl (≈75%) and ³⁷Cl (≈25%).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 (using the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n*   A very broad peak spanning from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is observed. This is a classic, unmistakable feature of the O-H stretching vibration in a **carboxylic acid** (-COOH). The broadness is caused by extensive hydrogen bonding.\n*   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. This position, combined with the broad O-H peak, confirms the presence of a **carboxylic acid** functional group.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n*   **Signal at 11.0 ppm (s, 1H):**\n    *   The chemical shift (11.0 ppm) is very far downfield, which is characteristic of the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid**.\n    *   The integration (1H) confirms it is a single proton.\n    *   This signal provides further strong evidence for a carboxylic acid group.\n*   **Signals at 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm), indicating a substituted benzene ring.\n    *   There are a total of 4 aromatic protons (2H + 2H), meaning the benzene ring is disubstituted.\n    *   The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. This symmetrical substitution pattern results in only two distinct types of aromatic protons.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid group attached to a para-substituted benzene ring.\n\n**4. Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring with a carboxylic acid and a chlorine atom in the 1,4 (para) positions. This matches the ¹H NMR substitution pattern.\n    *   **Functional Group:** It is a carboxylic acid, matching the IR and the 11.0 ppm NMR signal.\n    *   **Molecular Weight:** The formula is C₇H₅ClO₂. With ³⁵Cl, the mass is (7×12) + (5×1) + (1×35) + (2×16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156. This matches the MS data.\n    *   This structure is fully consistent with all the provided data.\n\n*   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho*-substituted isomer. It would not produce the simple two-doublet NMR pattern.\n\n*   **C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. It would not have the characteristic IR and NMR signals for a carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is an acid chloride, not a carboxylic acid.
