    "Here is the reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    The problem states that the number of stars (`N`) per unit of parallax (`plx`) varies as `1/plx^5`. In mathematical terms, this is a statement about a number density with respect to parallax. We can write this as:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`\n    where `dN/d(plx)` is the rate of change of the number of stars with respect to parallax.\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance (`r`) per unit range of distance. This is asking for the number density with respect to distance, which can be written as `dN/dr`. We need to find what `dN/dr` is proportional to.\n\n3.  **Relate Distance and Parallax:**\n    The parallax of a star is inversely proportional to its distance. The fundamental relationship is:\n    `r = 1/plx`\n    From this, we can also express parallax in terms of distance:\n    `plx = 1/r`\n\n4.  **Use the Chain Rule of Calculus:**\n    We need to find a relationship between `dN/dr` and `dN/d(plx)`.

    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Given Information**\n\nThe problem states that the number of stars (`N`) observed in a region of the sky varies with parallax (`plx`) as `1/plx^5`. This is a statement about the number density of stars with respect to parallax. In calculus terms, it means the rate of change of the number of stars with respect to a change in parallax is proportional to `1/plx^5`.\n\nWe can write this as:\n`dN / d(plx) ∝ 1 / plx^5`\n\n**2. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe question asks how the number of stars (`N`) changes with distance (`r`) per unit range of distance. This is asking for the number density of stars with respect to distance. In calculus terms, we need to find the proportionality for `dN / dr`.\n\n**3. Establish the Relationship between Distance and Parallax**\n\nThe distance to a star (`r`) is defined as the reciprocal of its parallax (`plx`).\n`r = 1 / plx`\n\nFrom this relationship, we can also express parallax in terms of distance:\n`plx = 1 / r`\n\n**4. Use the Chain Rule to Relate the Derivatives**\n\nWe want to find `dN/dr`, and we know the proportionality for `dN/d(plx)`. We can relate these two derivatives using the chain rule from calculus:\n\n`dN / dr = (dN / d(plx)) * (d(plx) / dr)`\n\n**5. Calculate the Derivative `d(plx) / dr`**\n\nWe need to differentiate the expression for parallax with respect to distance.\nSince `plx = 1/r = r⁻¹`, we can use the power rule for differentiation (`d(xⁿ)/dx = nxⁿ⁻¹`):\n\n`d(plx) / dr = d(r⁻¹) / dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1 / r²`\n\n**6. Substitute and Solve**\n\nNow we substitute our known expressions back into the chain rule equation:\n\n`dN / dr ∝ (1 / plx^5) * (-1 / r²)`\n\nThe expression on the right side contains both `plx` and `r`. To find the final relationship, we must express everything in terms of `r`. We use the relationship `plx = 1/r`:\n\n`1 / plx^5 = 1 / (1/r)⁵ = r⁵`\n\nNow, substitute this back into our proportionality:\n\n`dN / dr ∝ (r⁵) * (-1 / r²)`\n\n`dN / dr ∝ -r⁵ / r²`\n\n`dN / dr ∝ -r³`\n\n**7. Interpret the Result**\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the number density in a parallax interval and a distance interval have opposite relationships (as distance increases, parallax decreases), but for the purpose of the proportionality requested in the question (\"How does the number... change\"), we are interested in the magnitude.\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to `r³`.\n\n`dN / dr ∝ r³`\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",

We use `plx = 1/r`.\n    `1/plx^5 = 1/(1/r)⁵ = r⁵`\n\n    Now substitute this back into the proportionality for `dN/dr`:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (-1/r²)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ -r^(5-2)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ -r³`\n\n8.  **Interpret the result:** The question asks how the number of stars changes, which refers to the magnitude of the proportionality.

Specifically, it says the number of stars *per unit of parallax* varies as `1/plx^5`. In mathematical terms, this is a statement about a number density or a rate of change:\n`dN / d(plx) ∝ 1 / plx^5`\nwhere `∝` means \"is proportional to\".\n\n**2. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks how the number of stars, `N`, changes with distance, `r`, *per unit range of distance*. This means we need to find the proportionality for the number density with respect to distance, which is written as:\n`dN / dr`\n\n**3. Recall the Fundamental Relationship between Distance and Parallax**\nIn astronomy, the distance to a star (`r`) in parsecs is the reciprocal of its parallax angle (`plx`) in arcseconds:\n`r = 1 / plx`\nThis also means we can express parallax in terms of distance:\n`plx = 1 / r`\n\n**4. Use the Chain Rule to Relate the Two Rates**\nTo find `dN/dr` from `dN/d(plx)`, we can use the chain rule of calculus, which connects the rates of change of related variables:\n`dN / dr = (dN / d(plx)) * (d(plx) / dr)`\n\n**5. Calculate the Derivative `d(plx)/dr`**\nWe need to find how parallax changes with respect to distance. We start with the relationship `plx = 1/r = r⁻¹` and differentiate it with respect to `r` using the power rule:\n`d(plx) / dr = d(r⁻¹) / dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1 / r²`\n\n**6. Substitute and Simplify**\nNow we substitute our known relationships into the chain rule equation:\n*   `dN / d(plx) ∝ 1 / plx^5`\n*   `d(plx) / dr = -1 / r²`\n\nPlugging these in gives:\n`dN / dr ∝ (1 / plx^5) * (-1 / r²)`\n\nTo get our final answer, we must express the entire right side in terms of a single variable, `r`. We substitute `plx = 1/r` into the expression:\n`dN / dr ∝ (1 / (1/r)⁵) * (-1 / r²)`\n\nSimplify the `(1/r)⁵` term:\n`1 / (1/r)⁵ = r⁵`\n\nNow substitute this back into the proportionality:\n`dN / dr ∝ (r⁵) * (-1 / r²)`\n`dN / dr ∝ - (r⁵ / r²)`\n`dN / dr ∝ -r³`\n\n**7. Interpret the Final Result**\nThe result `dN/dr ∝ -r³` tells us that the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to `r³`. The negative sign arises from the inverse relationship between distance and parallax (as one increases, the other decreases). The question is concerned with the scaling of the number density, so we look at the magnitude of the relationship.\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit distance changes as `r³`.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
