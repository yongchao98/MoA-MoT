    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Part 1: Calculate the Relative Speed (v_rel)**\n\nThe problem involves relativistic speeds, so we must use the Lorentz velocity addition formula to find the relative speed. The formula for the velocity of object 2 as observed from object 1's reference frame is:\n\nv_rel = (v2 - v1) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c²)\n\nWhere:\n*   v1 = velocity of astronaut 1 = 0.6c\n*   v2 = velocity of astronaut 2 = 0.5c\n*   c = speed of light\n\nLet's plug in the values:\nv_rel = (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)\nv_rel = -0.1c / (1 - 0.3 * c² / c²)\nv_rel = -0.1c / (1 - 0.3)\nv_rel = -0.1c / 0.7\nv_rel = -(1/7)c\n\nThe question asks for the relative speed, which is the magnitude of the relative velocity.\n|v_rel| = (1/7)c ≈ 0.1428c\n\nSo, the relative speed is approximately **0.14c**.\n\n**Part 2: Calculate the Total Energy (E_total)**\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The formula for the relativistic energy of a single particle is:\n\nE = γ * m₀ * c²\n\nWhere:\n*   m₀ is the rest mass of the particle.\n*   γ (gamma, the Lorentz factor) is calculated as: γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)\n\n**Calculate the energy of the first astronaut (E1):**\n*   Rest mass (m₁₀) = 2m\n*   Velocity (v₁) = 0.6c\n*   γ₁ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25\n*   E₁ = γ₁ * m₁₀ * c² = 1.25 * (2m) * c² = 2.5 mc²\n\n**Calculate the energy of the second astronaut (E2):**\n*   Rest mass (m₂₀) = 3m\n*   Velocity (v₂) = 0.5c\n*   γ₂ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1 / 0.866 ≈ 1.1547\n*   E₂ = γ₂ * m₂₀ * c² = (1 / sqrt(0.75)) * (3m) * c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3 * mc² ≈ 3.464 mc²\n\n**Calculate the total energy (E_total):**\n*   E_total = E₁ + E₂\n*   E_total = 2.5 mc² + 3.464 mc²\n*   E_total ≈ 5.964 mc²\n\nSo, the total energy is approximately **5.96 mc²**.\n\nTo verify the calculations, we can use a Python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Part 1: Relative Speed\nv1 = 0.6\nv2 = 0.5\n# Formula: v_rel = (v2 - v1) / (1 - v1*v2)\nv_rel = (v2 - v1) / (1 - v1 * v2)\nv_rel_speed = abs(v_rel) # Speed is the magnitude\nprint(f\"Relative speed is approximately: {v_rel_speed:.2f}c\")\n\n# Part 2: Total Energy\n# Energy 1\ngamma1 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v1**2)\nE1_factor = gamma1 * 2 # E1 = (gamma1 * 2) * mc^2\n\n# Energy 2\ngamma2 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v2**2)\nE2_factor = gamma2 * 3 # E2 = (gamma2 * 3) * mc^2\n\n# Total Energy\nE_total_factor = E1_factor + E2_factor\nprint(f\"Total energy is approximately: {E_total_factor:.2f} mc^2\")\n```\n> Relative speed is approximately: 0.14c\n> Total energy is approximately: 5.96 mc^2\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated relative speed is **0.14c** and the total energy is **5.96 mc²**. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here's my thinking process to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Problem**\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the question is asking and what information is provided.\n\n*   **Given:**\n    *   Astronaut 1 mass (m₁): `2m`\n    *   Astronaut 1 velocity (v₁): `0.6c` in the positive x-direction.\n    *   Astronaut 2 mass (m₂): `3m`\n    *   Astronaut 2 velocity (v₂): `0.5c` in the positive x-direction.\n    *   `c` is the speed of light.\n\n*   **To Find:**\n    1.  The relative speed (`v_rel`) between the two astronauts.\n    2.  The total energy (`E_total`) of the system.\n\n*   **Key Concept:** The speeds are \"relativistic\" (a significant fraction of the speed of light). This tells me I cannot use classical mechanics (like simply subtracting speeds `0.6c - 0.5c`). I must use the formulas from Einstein's theory of special relativity.\n\n**2. Plan the Calculation**\n\nI will solve this in two parts, matching the two quantities I need to find.\n\n*   **Part 1: Calculate the Relative Speed (v_rel)**\n    *   The correct formula for relativistic velocity addition/subtraction is the Lorentz transformation for velocities. To find the velocity of astronaut 2 as observed by astronaut 1, the formula is:\n        `v_rel = (v₂ - v₁) / (1 - (v₁ * v₂) / c²)`\n    *   I will substitute `v₁ = 0.6c` and `v₂ = 0.5c` into this formula.\n    *   The result will be a velocity. The question asks for \"speed,\" which is the magnitude (absolute value) of the velocity.\n\n*   **Part 2: Calculate the Total Energy (E_total)**\n    *   The total energy of a system is the sum of the energies of its components.\n        `E_total = E₁ + E₂`\n    *   The formula for the total relativistic energy of a single particle is:\n        `E = γ * m₀ * c²`\n        where `m₀` is the rest mass and `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is `1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   I need to calculate the energy for each astronaut separately.\n        *   For astronaut 1: `E₁ = γ₁ * m₁ * c²`. I'll first calculate `γ₁` using `v₁ = 0.6c`.\n        *   For astronaut 2: `E₂ = γ₂ * m₂ * c²`. I'll first calculate `γ₂` using `v₂ = 0.5c`.\n    *   Finally, I'll add `E₁` and `E₂` to get `E_total`.\n\n**3. Execute the Plan (Step-by-Step Calculation)**\n\n**Part 1: Relative Speed**\n\n1.  Write down the formula:\n    `v_rel = (v₂ - v₁) / (1 - (v₁ * v₂) / c²)`\n\n2.  Substitute the values:\n    `v_rel = (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)`\n\n3.  Simplify the numerator and the term in the denominator:\n    `v_rel = (-0.1c) / (1 - (0.3c²) / c²)`\n\n4.  The `c²` terms cancel out in the denominator:\n    `v_rel = (-0.1c) / (1 - 0.3)`\n    `v_rel = (-0.1c) / 0.7`\n\n5.  Calculate the final value:\n    `v_rel = -(1/7)c ≈ -0.1428c`\n\n6.  Find the speed (the magnitude):\n    `|v_rel| ≈ 0.14c`\n\nThis already points towards options C or D.\n\n**Part 2: Total Energy**\n\n1.  **Energy of Astronaut 1 (E₁):**\n    *   Calculate `γ₁` for `v₁ = 0.6c`:\n        `γ₁ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25`\n    *   Calculate `E₁` using `m₁ = 2m`:\n        `E₁ = γ₁ * m₁ * c² = 1.25 * (2m) * c² = 2.5 mc²`\n\n2.  **Energy of Astronaut 2 (E₂):**\n    *   Calculate `γ₂` for `v₂ = 0.5c`:\n        `γ₂ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75)`\n        (This isn't a clean number, so I'll keep it as `1/sqrt(0.75)` for now or use a calculator). `sqrt(0.75) ≈ 0.866`. So `γ₂ ≈ 1 / 0.866 ≈ 1.1547`.\n    *   Calculate `E₂` using `m₂ = 3m`:\n        `E₂ = γ₂ * m₂ * c² ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c² ≈ 3.464 mc²`\n\n3.  **Total Energy (E_total):**\n    *   Add the two energies:\n        `E_total = E₁ + E₂ = 2.5 mc² + 3.464 mc²`\n    *   `E_total = (2.5 + 3.464) mc² = 5.964 mc²`\n\n4.  Round to two decimal places:\n    `E_total ≈ 5.96 mc²`\n\n**4. Final Verification and Answer Selection**\n\nMy calculated values are:\n*   `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`\n*   `E_total ≈ 5.96 mc²`\n\nNow I compare these with the given options:\nA) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc²  (Incorrect)\nB) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc² (Incorrect)\nC) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc² (Incorrect energy)\nD) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc² (Matches both my calculations)\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\nTo be absolutely sure of the numerical precision, I can quickly write a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given values ---\n# Velocities as a fraction of c\nv1 = 0.6\nv2 = 0.5\n# Mass factors\nm1_factor = 2\nm2_factor = 3\n\n# --- Part 1: Relative Speed ---\n# Using the Lorentz velocity transformation: v_rel = (v2 - v1) / (1 - v1*v2)\n# The velocities are in units of c, so c=1 in this calculation.\nv_rel_c = (v2 - v1) / (1 - v1 * v2)\n# Speed is the magnitude\nrelative_speed_c = abs(v_rel_c)\n\n# --- Part 2: Total Energy ---\n# Lorentz factor gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n# For astronaut 1\ngamma1 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v1**2)\nEnergy1_factor = gamma1 * m1_factor # This will be the coefficient of mc^2\n\n# For astronaut 2\ngamma2 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v2**2)\nEnergy2_factor = gamma2 * m2_factor # This will be the coefficient of mc^2\n\n# Total energy factor\nTotal_Energy_factor = Energy1_factor + Energy2_factor\n\n# --- Print the results formatted to match the options ---\nprint(f\"v_rel = {relative_speed_c:.2f}c\")\nprint(f\"E = {Total_Energy_factor:.2f} mc^2\")\n\n```\n> v_rel = 0.14c\n> E = 5.96 mc^2\n\nThe code confirms my manual calculations. The relative speed is `0.14c` and the total energy is `5.96 mc^2`. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
