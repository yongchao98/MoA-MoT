    "Answering this question requires a careful analysis of electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions, including the directing effects of various substituents. The goal is to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. It has three substituents on a benzene ring:\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n\nAll three substituents are in a *meta* relationship to each other (1,3,5 substitution pattern).\n\n**2. Analyze Substituent Directing Effects**\n\nWe need to consider how each substituent directs incoming electrophiles:\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating (weakly) and an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Deactivating (strongly) and a *meta*-director.\n\nThe 1,3,5-substitution pattern suggests that the synthesis should involve *meta*-directing groups to guide the substitution pattern.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences (Options A-D)**\n\nLet's evaluate each option step-by-step:\n\n**A) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n*   **Step i:** Benzene + Br2/FeBr3 → Bromobenzene. The -Br group is an *o,p*-director.\n*   **Step ii:** Bromobenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → A mixture of o-bromonitrobenzene and p-bromonitrobenzene.\n*   **Step iii:** Friedel-Crafts Acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3) on either bromonitrobenzene isomer. **This reaction fails.** The presence of a strongly deactivating nitro group (-NO2) on the ring prevents Friedel-Crafts acylation. Therefore, option A is incorrect.\n\n**B) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n*   **Step i:** Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitrobenzene.\n*   **Step ii:** Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → Aniline. The nitro group is reduced to an amino group (-NH2).\n*   **Step iii:** Friedel-Crafts Acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3) on aniline. **This reaction fails.** The amino group (-NH2) is a Lewis base and reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents the acylation reaction. Therefore, option B is incorrect.\n\n**C) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2 ...**\n*   **Step i:** Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n*   **Step ii:** Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n*   **Step iii:** Aniline → Benzenediazonium chloride.\n*   **Step iv:** Benzenediazonium chloride + H3PO2 → Benzene. This is a deamination reaction that removes the amino group, returning to the starting material, benzene. This sequence is circular and does not lead to the product. Therefore, option C is incorrect.\n\n**D) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n*   **Step i:** Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone. This Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the acetyl group. The -COCH3 group is a *meta*-director.\n*   **Step ii:** Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone. Since the acetyl group is a *meta*-director, the incoming bromine atom is directed to the meta position (position 3).\n*   **Step iii:** 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. At this stage, the ring has two substituents: -COCH3 (at position 1, *meta*-director) and -Br (at position 3, *o,p*-director).\n    *   The *meta*-directing -COCH3 group directs the incoming -NO2 group to position 5.\n    *   The *ortho,para*-directing -Br group directs the incoming -NO2 group to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n    *   The directing effects are **cooperative** or **reinforcing** for position 5 (which is *meta* to the acetyl group and *ortho* to the bromo group). This makes position 5 the major site of nitration.\n    *   This three-step sequence successfully produces the target molecule in high yield.\n\nThe remaining steps in option D (iv-vii) are nonsensical for the synthesis of the target compound. They describe the reduction of the nitro group and its eventual removal, which would undo the work of step iii. However, the initial three steps constitute a valid and efficient synthesis. Among the given choices, option D is the only one that contains a correct synthetic pathway to the desired product.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe most logical and high-yield synthesis route presented in the options is the one beginning with Friedel-Crafts acylation, followed by bromination, and then nitration. This corresponds to the first three steps of option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This problem requires us to determine the correct order of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene. This involves understanding electrophilic aromatic substitution and the directing effects of different substituents.\n\n**1.

It has three substituents on the benzene ring:\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n\nNotice the 1,3,5-substitution pattern. All substituents are *meta* to each other. This suggests that the synthesis will rely heavily on *meta*-directing groups.\n\n**2.

The -Br group is an *o,p*-director.\n    *   Step (ii) nitrates bromobenzene, forming a mixture of *o*- and *p*-bromonitrobenzene.\n    *   Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation. This step will fail because the ring already has a strongly deactivating nitro group on it. So, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n    *   Step (i) produces nitrobenzene.\n    *   Step (ii) reduces the nitro group to an amino group (-NH2), forming aniline.\n    *   Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This step will fail. The basic amino group (-NH2) reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents acylation. So, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2...**\n    *   This sequence converts benzene to nitrobenzene (i), then to aniline (ii), then to a diazonium salt (iii), and finally, the diazonium salt is reduced back to benzene (iv). This is a circular route that doesn't lead to the product. So, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n    *   **Step (i) Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene is acylated to form acetophenone. The acetyl group (-COCH3) is a *meta*-director. This is a good first step.\n    *   **Step (ii) Bromination:** Acetophenone is brominated. Since the acetyl group is a *meta*-director, the bromine will be added at the *meta* position (position 3), forming 3-bromoacetophenone. This correctly establishes the 1,3 relationship.\n    *   **Step (iii) Nitration:** 3-bromoacetophenone is nitrated. We must consider the directing effects of both groups already on the ring:\n        *   The -COCH3 group at position 1 is a *meta*-director, directing the new -NO2 group to position 5.\n        *   The -Br group at position 3 is an *o,p*-director, directing the new -NO2 group to positions 2, 4, and 5.\n        *   Since both groups direct the incoming nitro group to position 5, this position is strongly favored (a cooperative or reinforcing effect). This step will successfully produce the target molecule, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, in high yield.\n\nThe subsequent steps listed in option D (iv-vii) are unnecessary for making the target compound, but the initial three steps represent the only viable synthetic route among the choices.

Its *ortho* positions are 2 and 4, and its *para* position is 6.\n        *   However, the directing influence of the *meta*-directing acetyl group is dominant in this case, and placing the nitro group at position 5 is the only route that avoids placing the positive charge of the reaction intermediate on the carbon attached to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group. The directing effects are considered **cooperative** or **reinforcing** for position 5.\n    *   This sequence successfully produces the target molecule in high yield.
