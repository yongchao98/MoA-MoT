    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\nThe product in both reactions is a stereoisomer of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a delta-lactone, which is a six-membered cyclic ester. The structure has a chiral center at carbon 4, where the ethyl group is attached.\n*   Reaction 1 yields the (R)-enantiomer.\n*   Reaction 2 yields the (S)-enantiomer.\n\nA lactone like this is typically formed from the intramolecular cyclization of a corresponding hydroxy-carboxylic acid. For a six-membered lactone (delta-lactone), the precursor is a 5-hydroxy carboxylic acid. In this specific case, the precursor that cyclizes is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. The chiral center at C3 of this acid becomes the chiral center at C4 of the lactone.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\nThe options provided suggest the starting material is a stereoisomer of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule is a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid) where one carboxylic acid group is free and the other is an isobutyl ester.\n\nStructure: HOOC-CH₂(C2)-CH(Et)(C3)-CH₂(C4)-C(=O)O-iBu(C5)\n\nThis molecule has two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid and an ester. It also has a chiral center at carbon 3, the same carbon that corresponds to the chiral center in the final lactone product.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction 1**\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that is known to selectively reduce esters over carboxylic acids.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH₄ reduces the isobutyl ester at C5 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The carboxylic acid at C1 is left unchanged.\n    2.  This forms the intermediate: 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n        HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH\n    3.  The acid workup (H⁺) catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of this hydroxy-acid to form the final lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reactions occur at C1 and C5, which are not the chiral center (C3). Therefore, the configuration of the chiral center is retained throughout the reaction sequence. To produce the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction 2**\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (BH₃) is a reducing agent that is known for its high selectivity in reducing carboxylic acids over esters.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid at C1 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The isobutyl ester at C5 is left unchanged.\n    2.  This forms the intermediate: isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n        HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu\n    3.  The acid workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol to form the final lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Similar to Reaction 1, the chemical transformations do not involve the chiral center at C3. The configuration is retained. To produce the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Starting material A is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material B is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This problem requires understanding the selective reactivity of two different reducing agents, lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) and borane (BH₃), towards a molecule containing both a carboxylic acid and an ester functional group. It also involves tracking the stereochemistry through the reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Products**\n\n*   **Starting Materials (A and B):** The options indicate that the starting materials are stereoisomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule is a monoester of 3-ethylglutaric acid. It has a chiral center at carbon-3 (the carbon with the ethyl group), a free carboxylic acid group at one end, and an isobutyl ester at the other.\n*   **Products:** The products are the (R) and (S) enantiomers of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered cyclic ester, also known as a δ-lactone. The chiral center in the product is at carbon-4, which corresponds to carbon-3 in the starting material.\n\n**2. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH₄ will reduce the isobutyl ester group (`-COOiBu`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`).\n    2.  The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) remains unchanged.\n    3.  This creates an intermediate: 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    4.  The subsequent acid workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization), where the hydroxyl group attacks the carboxylic acid carbonyl to form the six-membered lactone ring.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The chemical transformations (reduction of the ester and lactonization) occur at C-1 and C-5 of the pentanoic acid chain. The chiral center is at C-3 and is not involved in the reaction. Therefore, its stereochemical configuration is retained. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** Borane (BH₃) is a unique reducing agent that selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  BH₃ will reduce the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`).\n    2.  The isobutyl ester group (`-COOiBu`) remains unchanged.\n    3.  This creates an intermediate: isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n    4.  The subsequent acid workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (iBuOH) to form the six-membered lactone ring.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, the chemical changes do not affect the chiral center at C-3. The configuration is retained. To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\n\nCombining the conclusions from both reactions:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis matches the description in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This problem requires a careful analysis of the selectivity of two different reducing agents and how stereochemistry is preserved during the reactions.\n\n**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material and Products:**\n    *   **Starting Material:** The options show that the starting material (A or B) is a stereoisomer of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule contains two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an ester (`-COOC₄H₉`). It also has a single chiral center at carbon 3, which bears the ethyl group.\n    *   **Product:** The product in both reactions is a stereoisomer of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a δ-lactone (a six-membered cyclic ester). The chiral center from the starting material (at C3) is now at C4 in the lactone product.

The chiral center at C3 is not involved in the reaction.
