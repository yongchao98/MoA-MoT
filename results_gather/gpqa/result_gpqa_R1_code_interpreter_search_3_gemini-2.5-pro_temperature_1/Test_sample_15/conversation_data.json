    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine its optical activity. A compound is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This generally means the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** The name indicates a four-carbon chain (but-ene) with a double bond at C1. There's a chlorine on C1 and a methyl group on C2. The (Z) configuration specifies the relative position of substituents around the double bond. The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** We need to check for chiral centers (a carbon with four different substituents) and overall molecular symmetry.\n        *   There are no chiral centers in this molecule. C1 and C2 are sp2 hybridized (part of a double bond). C3 is a CH2 group, and C4 is a CH3 group.\n        *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry. The plane containing the atoms of the double bond (Cl, H on C1; C2, C(methyl), C(ethyl)) acts as a plane of symmetry for the entire molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the molecule possesses a plane of symmetry, it is achiral and therefore **not optically active**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex bridged ring system. The name itself provides the key information. It specifies the absolute configuration at two stereocenters (3aR, 7aS) and the geometry of a double bond (E).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The designation of a specific configuration like (3aR, 7aS) strongly suggests the molecule is chiral and that this is one specific enantiomer. We must consider if it could be a meso compound (an achiral compound with stereocenters). The parent ring system without the substituent at position 8 would be meso with the (3aR, 7aS) configuration. However, the presence of the `8-(chloromethylene)` substituent (=CHCl) on the methano bridge (C8) breaks the internal symmetry of the molecule. There is no longer a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule has stereocenters and lacks internal symmetry. It is chiral. The name refers to a single enantiomer. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** Succinic acid is a four-carbon dicarboxylic acid. 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid has methyl groups on C2 and C3: `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule has two stereocenters, at C2 and C3. The name specifies the configuration as (2R, 3S). For a molecule with two stereocenters where the substituents at each center are the same (here, H, CH3, COOH, and the other chiral carbon group), the (R,S) combination corresponds to the meso form. A meso compound has stereocenters but is achiral due to internal symmetry. In a staggered conformation, this molecule has a center of inversion. In a Fischer projection representing an eclipsed conformation, it has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is a meso compound. It is achiral and **not optically active**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The stereoisomers of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid are the (2R,3R) enantiomer, the (2S,3S) enantiomer, and the (2R,3S) meso compound. The (2R,3R) isomer is the enantiomer of the (2S,3S) isomer. It does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   **Conclusion:** (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is a single enantiomer of a chiral compound. It is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an alcohol group on C1.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The name specifies the (R) configuration at C1. Let's verify C1 is a stereocenter. It is bonded to four different groups: 1) -OH, 2) -H, 3) -CH2-CH= (path towards C2), and 4) -CH2-CH2-CH= (path towards C6). Because the paths around the ring are different due to the position of the double bond, C1 is indeed a stereocenter. The molecule as a whole lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is chiral, and the name refers to a single enantiomer. It is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl (-OH) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The (1s,3s,5s) notation indicates the relative stereochemistry, meaning all three -OH groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** Although the molecule has three stereocenters (C1, C3, C5), the high degree of symmetry makes it achiral. Whether the chair conformation has the three -OH groups in axial positions or equatorial positions, the molecule possesses multiple planes of symmetry. For example, a plane passing through the C1-C4 axis will reflect C2 onto C6 and C3 onto C5, with the substituents also being reflected perfectly.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This molecule is a meso compound. It is achiral and **not optically active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** Based on IUPAC nomenclature for ketones, the name describes a butan-1-one parent, which is a 4-carbon chain with the ketone at C1. A cyclopentyl group is attached to C1, and a methyl group is attached to C3. The structure is `(Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3`.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** We must check for chiral centers. The only potential candidate is C3 of the butane chain. C3 is bonded to four groups:\n        1.  -H\n        2.  -CH3 (the substituent)\n        3.  -CH3 (which is C4 of the chain)\n        4.  -CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl (the rest of the molecule)\n        Groups 2 and 3 are both methyl groups. Since two of the four groups attached to C3 are identical, C3 is not a chiral center. The molecule can adopt a conformation with a plane of symmetry (the plane bisecting the two methyl groups of the isobutyl fragment and the cyclopentyl ring).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule has no chiral centers and is achiral. It is **not optically active**.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Optically active:\n    *   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n    *   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n    *   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n*   Not optically active:\n    *   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\n    *   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n    *   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol\n    *   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "A compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is not superimposable on its mirror image.

The plane containing the double bond acts as a plane of symmetry for the entire molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Since it has a plane of symmetry, it is achiral and **not optically active**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   **Structure**: This is a complex bicyclic molecule. The name itself provides the crucial information.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: The designation `(3aR, 7aS)` specifies the absolute configuration at two stereocenters. This indicates that the molecule is chiral and that we are considering a specific enantiomer. While some molecules with stereocenters can be achiral (meso compounds), the presence of the asymmetric `=CHCl` group on the methano bridge (C8) destroys any potential plane of symmetry that might exist in the parent ring system.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The molecule has stereocenters and lacks internal symmetry. Therefore, it is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   **Structure**: The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: The substituents on C2 are the same as on C3 (H, CH3, COOH). When a molecule has two identical stereocenters with opposite configurations (one R, one S), it is a meso compound. Meso compounds have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion and are achiral, despite having stereocenters.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This is a meso compound. It is achiral and **not optically active**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   **Structure**: This is a stereoisomer of the previous compound, with the structure `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: This is the (R,R) isomer. It is chiral and its mirror image is the (S,S) isomer. This molecule does not possess any plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This is a single enantiomer of a chiral compound.

Since the paths are different, C1 is a stereocenter. The designation `(R)` specifies a single enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The molecule is chiral and is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   **Structure**: This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The `(1s,3s,5s)` notation implies that all three groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane passing through the C1-OH bond and the C4 atom bisects the molecule into two identical halves.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Due to the presence of planes of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and **not optically active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   **Structure**: The structure is `(Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`. This is isobutyl cyclopentyl ketone.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: We check for chiral centers. The only candidate is C3 of the butanoyl chain. However, C3 is bonded to a hydrogen, a `-CH2-C(=O)-` group, and two identical methyl groups `(-CH3)`. Since two of the four groups are identical, C3 is not a chiral center.

    "A compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral, meaning it is a non-superimposable mirror image of itself.

Therefore, this molecule is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two stereocenters (at C2 and C3). However, the substituents on C2 are identical to those on C3.
