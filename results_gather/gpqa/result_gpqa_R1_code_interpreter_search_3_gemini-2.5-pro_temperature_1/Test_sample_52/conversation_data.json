    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the given information:**\n    *   **Molecular Structure:** The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This corresponds to a C6H4 core.\n    *   **FTIR Spectrum:** An ester group is present. An ester has the functional group -COO-, which contains one carbon and two oxygen atoms.\n    *   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n        *   **Six signals total:** This indicates six different types of protons in the molecule.\n        *   **Two aromatic-H signals:** A di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4) has 4 aromatic protons. The presence of only two signals for these 4 protons strongly suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely para (1,4) substitution. This would make the protons at positions 2 and 6 equivalent, and the protons at positions 3 and 5 equivalent, giving two signals.\n        *   **Two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This is a classic splitting pattern for a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3). The proton on the carbon adjacent to the CH3 group is split by the other vinyl proton (into a doublet) and by the three protons of the CH3 group (into a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets (dq). The other vinyl proton is only split by its vinyl neighbor, resulting in a doublet (d). This fragment has the formula C3H5.\n        *   **Two -CH3 signals:** One of these methyl groups belongs to the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) identified above. The second methyl group must be part of the ester functionality.\n        *   **No -CH2- signals:** This is a critical piece of information that helps eliminate many possible structures.\n\n2.  **Assemble the molecular fragments:**\n    *   Fragment 1: A di-substituted benzene ring, **C6H4**.\n    *   Fragment 2: A propenyl group, **-CH=CH-CH3** (formula **C3H5**).\n    *   Fragment 3: An ester group containing the second methyl group, with no -CH2- groups. There are two possibilities for this fragment:\n        *   A methyl ester group: **-COOCH3**. This fragment has the formula **C2H3O2**.\n        *   An acetate group: **-OCOCH3**. This fragment also has the formula **C2H3O2**.\n\n3.  **Determine the total chemical formula:**\n    Let's combine the fragments to build the complete molecule. Regardless of whether the ester is a methyl ester attached to the ring (e.g., methyl 4-propenylbenzoate) or an acetate ester attached to the ring (e.g., 4-propenylphenyl acetate), the constituent parts are the same:\n    *   Benzene ring part: C6H4\n    *   Propenyl part: C3H5\n    *   Ester-methyl part: C2H3O2\n\n    Now, sum the atoms:\n    *   Carbon (C): 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2\n\n    The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Verify the result and eliminate other options:**\n    *   **C11H12O2 (Option A):** This formula perfectly matches our derived structure. The degree of unsaturation (DoU) is C + 1 - H/2 = 11 + 1 - 12/2 = 6. This corresponds to a benzene ring (DoU=4), a C=C double bond (DoU=1), and a C=O double bond (DoU=1), which is consistent with our fragments.\n    *   **C11H14O2 (Option B):** The DoU is 11 + 1 - 14/2 = 5. A benzene ring (DoU=4) and an ester (DoU=1) already account for DoU=5. This leaves no room for the C=C double bond required for the vinyl protons. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n    *   **C12H14O2 (Option D):** The DoU is 12 + 1 - 14/2 = 6. This DoU is consistent with the required functional groups. To get from C11H12O2 to C12H14O2, we need to add CH2. For example, if we had an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) instead of a methyl ester, the formula would be C12H14O2. However, this structure contains a -CH2- group, which is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n    *   **C12H12O2 (Option C):** The DoU is 12 + 1 - 12/2 = 7. This requires an additional degree of unsaturation compared to our proposed structure (e.g., another C=C bond or a C≡C bond). This would lead to a more complex NMR spectrum (more vinyl or alkynyl signals) than what is described. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the spectroscopic data, the only plausible chemical formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This problem requires a step-by-step deduction of the molecular formula from spectroscopic data. Let's break down the information provided.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Skeleton and Functional Groups:**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us we have a benzene ring (C6H6) that has lost two hydrogen atoms to accommodate two substituents. This core fragment is **C6H4**.\n    *   **FTIR: \"presence of an ester group\"**: An ester functional group has the structure R-COO-R'. This group contributes at least one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms (**-COO-**).\n    *   **1H NMR: \"no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups\"**: This is a critical constraint. Whatever the structure is, it cannot contain a methylene group (-CH2-).\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Signals:**\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\"**: A di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4) has 4 aromatic protons. The fact that they appear as only two signals suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely a **para (1,4) substitution**. This would make the two protons adjacent to one substituent equivalent to each other, and the two protons adjacent to the other substituent also equivalent to each other.\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\"**: This is a classic splitting pattern for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**.\n        *   The proton on the carbon next to the methyl group is split by the adjacent vinyl proton (giving a doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (giving a quartet). This results in a \"doublet of quartets\" (dq).\n        *   The other vinyl proton is only split by its vinyl neighbor, resulting in a \"doublet\" (d).\n        *   This fragment has the formula **C3H5**.\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups\"**:\n        *   One -CH3 group is part of the propenyl group we just identified.\n        *   The second -CH3 group must be part of the ester. Since there are no -CH2- groups, it cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOCH2**CH3**). It must be either a **methyl ester (-COOCH3)** or an **acetate ester (-OCOCH3)**. In both cases, this fragment contributes **C2H3O2** to the formula (one carbon and three hydrogens from the methyl part, and one carbon and two oxygens from the carbonyl/ester part).\n\n3.  **Assemble the Fragments to Determine the Molecular Formula:**\n    Now, let's sum the atoms from all the identified pieces:\n    *   **Aromatic Ring**: C6H4\n    *   **Propenyl Group**: C3H5\n    *   **Ester-Methyl Group**: C2H3O2\n\n    Total atoms:\n    *   **Carbon (C)**: 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n    *   **Hydrogen (H)**: 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n    *   **Oxygen (O)**: 2\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Verify with Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    The formula for DoU is: `C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    For C11H12O2, the DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    Let's check if our proposed structure fits this DoU:\n    *   Benzene ring = 4 degrees (1 for the ring, 3 for the double bonds)\n    *   C=C double bond (in the propenyl group) = 1 degree\n    *   C=O double bond (in the ester group) = 1 degree\n    *   Total DoU = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n    The calculation is consistent.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   **A) C11H12O2**: This matches our derived formula perfectly.\n    *   **B) C11H14O2**: DoU = 5. This is inconsistent with the presence of a benzene ring, an ester, and a C=C double bond.\n    *   **C) C12H12O2**: DoU = 7. This requires an extra degree of unsaturation not supported by the data.\n    *   **D) C12H14O2**: DoU = 6. This DoU is possible, but to get this formula from C11H12O2, we would need to add a CH2 group (e.g., an ethyl ester instead of a methyl ester), which is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the evidence is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the given spectroscopic data to identify molecular fragments.**\n    *   **Structure Type:** The problem states the compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This means we start with a benzene ring (C6H6) and replace two hydrogens with two other groups. The core of the molecule is therefore a **C6H4** fragment.\n    *   **FTIR Data:** The spectrum shows an \"ester group\". An ester functional group is R-COO-R'. This group contains two oxygen atoms (**O2**) and at least one carbon atom (from the C=O carbonyl).\n    *   **1H NMR Data Breakdown:**\n        *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons. Seeing only two signals for these 4 protons implies symmetry. A para (1,4) substitution pattern is the most common arrangement that gives this symmetry (AA'BB' system), resulting in two signals. This confirms the **C6H4** fragment.\n        *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This is a very characteristic splitting pattern for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**.\n            *   The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by both the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and the three methyl protons (creating a quartet), leading to a \"doublet of quartets\".\n            *   The other vinyl proton is only coupled to its vinyl neighbor, resulting in a \"doublet\".\n            *   This fragment has the formula **C3H5**.\n        *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:**\n            *   One -CH3 group is part of the propenyl group we just identified.\n            *   The second -CH3 group must belong to the ester functionality.\n        *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a crucial piece of information. It means the ester cannot be, for example, an ethyl ester (-O-CH2-CH3) or have an ethyl group attached to the carbonyl (-CO-CH2-CH3), as both contain -CH2- groups. Since the second -CH3 group must be part of the ester, the only possibilities are a methyl ester (**-COOCH3**) or an acetate ester (**-O-CO-CH3**).\n\n2.  **Assemble the fragments to determine the chemical formula.**\n    We have identified three distinct parts of the molecule:\n    *   Fragment 1: The para-substituted benzene ring: **C6H4**\n    *   Fragment 2: The propenyl substituent: **C3H5**\n    *   Fragment 3: The ester part that includes the second methyl group. Whether it's -COOCH3 or -O-COCH3, the atoms contributed are the same: **C2H3O2** (one C and three H from the methyl, one C and two O from the ester core).\n\n3.  **Sum the atoms from all fragments.**\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5) + 2 (from C2H3O2) = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from C3H5) + 3 (from C2H3O2) = **12**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 0 + 0 + 2 (from C2H3O2) = **2**\n\n    The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Compare the result with the given options.**\n    *   A) C11H12O2 - This matches our derived formula.\n    *   B) C11H14O2 - Incorrect number of hydrogens.\n    *   C) C12H12O2 - Incorrect number of carbons.\n    *   D) C12H14O2 - Incorrect number of carbons and hydrogens. This would require an additional CH2 group, which is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data.\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly supports the formula C11H12O2.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This is a step-by-step analysis to determine the chemical formula from the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Framework and Functional Groups:**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This indicates a benzene ring (C6H6) where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by substituents. The core of this molecule is a C6H4 group.\n    *   **FTIR Spectrum**: The data confirms the \"presence of an ester group.\" An ester (R-COO-R') contains a carbonyl group (C=O) and an ether linkage (-O-). This functional group contributes two oxygen atoms (O2) to the molecule.\n    *   **1H NMR Constraint**: A crucial piece of information is that there are \"no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups.\" This significantly limits the possible structures of the substituents.\n\n2.  **Decode the 1H NMR Signals:**\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H**: A di-substituted benzene ring has four protons. The presence of only two signals for these four protons indicates a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely a para (1,4) arrangement. This confirms the C6H4 fragment.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets)**: This is a classic and definitive splitting pattern for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**. The proton on the carbon next to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (d) and the methyl group (q), resulting in a doublet of quartets (dq). The other vinyl proton is split only by its neighbor, giving a doublet (d). This fragment contributes **C3H5** to the formula.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups**:\n        *   One -CH3 signal belongs to the propenyl group identified above.\n        *   The second -CH3 signal must be part of the ester group. Given the constraint of \"no -CH2- groups,\" this methyl group must be directly attached to either the oxygen or the carbonyl of the ester. This means the ester is either a **methyl ester (-COOCH3)** or an **acetate ester (-OCOCH3)**.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Formula:**\n    Let's sum the atoms from the identified pieces:\n    *   **Fragment 1 (Aromatic Ring):** C6H4\n    *   **Fragment 2 (Propenyl Group):** C3H5\n    *   **Fragment 3 (Ester + Methyl Group):** Whether it's -COOCH3 or -OCOCH3, this fragment contributes one carbon and three hydrogens from the methyl group, plus one carbon and two oxygens from the ester core, for a total of **C2H3O2**.\n\n    Now, let's add them up:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 = **2**\n\n    The final chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Final Check against the Options:**\n    *   **A) C11H12O2**: This formula perfectly matches our deduction.\n    *   B) C11H14O2: Incorrect number of hydrogens.\n    *   C) C12H12O2: Incorrect number of carbons.\n    *   D) C12H14O2: Incorrect number of carbons and hydrogens. This formula would imply an additional CH2 group, which is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data.\n\nTherefore, the correct chemical formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to identify the correct chemical formula.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Structure:** The compound is described as a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" This means we start with a benzene ring (C6H6) and replace two of its hydrogen atoms with other groups. The core of the molecule is therefore a **C6H4** fragment.\n\n2.  **Identify Functional Groups from FTIR and NMR:**\n    *   **FTIR:** Shows an \"ester group.\" An ester has the general formula R-COO-R' and contributes two oxygen atoms (**O2**) to the molecular formula.\n    *   **1H NMR (Vinyl-H):** The spectrum shows two vinyl-H signals with specific splitting patterns: \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets.\" This is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**. This substituent has a formula of **C3H5**.\n    *   **1H NMR (-CH3):** The spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups.\"\n        *   One of these methyl groups is part of the propenyl group we just identified.\n        *   The other methyl group must be part of the ester substituent.\n    *   **1H NMR (No -CH2-):** The information that there are \"no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups\" is critical. It means that the ester cannot be, for instance, an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3), because that would contain a -CH2- group. Therefore, the second methyl group must be directly attached to the ester functionality, making it either a **methyl ester (-COOCH3)** or an **acetate ester (-OCOCH3)**. In either case, this entire fragment contributes **C2H3O2** to the total formula (C+H3 from the methyl part, and C+O2 from the ester core).\n\n3.  **Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Total Formula:**\n    Now, we sum the atoms from all the identified pieces:\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** C6H4\n    *   **Propenyl Group:** C3H5\n    *   **Ester-Methyl Group:** C2H3O2\n\n    Let's add them together:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2\n\n    The deduced molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    *   **A) C11H12O2:** This formula matches our detailed analysis.\n    *   B) C11H14O2: Incorrect number of hydrogens.\n    *   C) C12H12O2: Incorrect number of carbons.\n    *   D) C12H14O2: Incorrect number of carbons and hydrogens.
