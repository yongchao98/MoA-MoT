    "The probability of a planet transiting its host star, for a random orbital inclination and a circular orbit, is given by the formula:\n`P_transit = R_s / a`\nwhere `R_s` is the radius of the star and `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nWe want to find the ratio of the transit probability of Planet_1 to that of Planet_2:\n`Ratio = P_transit_1 / P_transit_2 = (R_s1 / a_1) / (R_s2 / a_2)`\n\nWe can rearrange this to:\n`Ratio = (R_s1 / R_s2) * (a_2 / a_1)`\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given that both host stars have the same radii, so `R_s1 = R_s2`. This makes the term `(R_s1 / R_s2) = 1`.\nThe ratio simplifies to:\n`Ratio = a_2 / a_1`\n\nTo find the semi-major axes (`a_1` and `a_2`), we use Kepler's Third Law, which relates the orbital period (`P`), the semi-major axis (`a`), and the mass of the host star (`M_s`).
