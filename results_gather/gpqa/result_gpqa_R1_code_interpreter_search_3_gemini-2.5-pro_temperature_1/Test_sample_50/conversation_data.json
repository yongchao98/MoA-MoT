    "This problem can be solved using the method of images, a powerful technique in electrostatics for problems involving conductors.\n\n### 1. The Method of Images\n\nThe core idea is to replace the complex induced charge distribution on the surface of the grounded conducting sphere with a simple \"image charge\" placed inside the sphere. The combination of the original charge `q` and this image charge `q'` must satisfy the boundary condition that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero (since it's grounded).\n\nLet the sphere have radius `R` and be centered at the origin. Let the real charge `q` be placed on the z-axis at a distance `d` from the center (position z = d).\n\nFor the potential to be zero on the surface of the sphere (at radius R), the image charge `q'` must be:\n*   Placed at a position `b` along the z-axis.\n*   The magnitude of the image charge `q'` and its position `b` are found to be:\n    *   `q' = - (R/d) * q`\n    *   `b = R^2 / d`\n\nNote that since `d > R` (the charge is outside the sphere), the position `b` is inside the sphere (`b < R`), and the image charge `q'` has the opposite sign to `q`.\n\n### 2. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. A common mistake is to simply calculate the potential energy between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`. The correct formula for the potential energy `U` in this configuration is half the product of the real charge and the potential created by the induced charges (or equivalently, the image charge) at the location of the real charge.\n\nThe formula is:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_image`\n\nWhere `V_image` is the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of the real charge `q`.\n\nLet's calculate `V_image`:\n*   The real charge `q` is at `z = d`.\n*   The image charge `q'` is at `z = b = R^2 / d`.\n*   The distance between the real charge and the image charge is `distance = d - b`.\n*   `distance = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\nThe potential `V_image` at the location `d` due to the charge `q'` at position `b` is:\n`V_image = k * q' / (distance)`\nwhere `k = 1 / (4πε₀)`.\n\nSubstitute the expressions for `q'` and `distance`:\n`V_image = k * (-R/d * q) / ((d^2 - R^2) / d)`\n\nThe `d` in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n`V_image = - k * R * q / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nNow, we can find the total potential energy `U` of the system:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_image`\n`U = (1/2) * q * [- k * R * q / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### 3. Conclusion\n\nThe calculated potential energy `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)` matches option A. The negative sign indicates that the force between the charge and the grounded sphere is attractive, which is expected.\n\n<<<A>>>",
