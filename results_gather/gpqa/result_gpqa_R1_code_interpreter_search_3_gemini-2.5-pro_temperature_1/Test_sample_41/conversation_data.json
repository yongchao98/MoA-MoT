    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main goal is to find the ratio of the orbital period of Planet3 to that of Planet1, which can be written as P3 / P1.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Given Information:**\n    *   System of three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, Planet3) around the same star.\n    *   Circular orbits.\n    *   Ratio of equilibrium temperatures: T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 1.4 and T_eq2 / T_eq3 = 2.3.\n    *   Ratio of masses: M1 / M2 = 1.15 and M2 / M3 = 1.35.\n    *   Albedo (A) is the same for all planets (A = 0.3).\n\n3.  **Relate Equilibrium Temperature to Orbital Distance:**\n    The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy absorbed from its star and the energy it radiates. The formula is:\n    T_eq⁴ ∝ (1 - A) / a²\n    where 'A' is the albedo and 'a' is the semi-major axis (orbital distance for a circular orbit).\n    Since all planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo 'A', the term (1 - A) is constant for all three planets. Therefore, the relationship simplifies to:\n    T_eq⁴ ∝ 1 / a²\n    Taking the square root of both sides gives:\n    T_eq² ∝ 1 / a\n    This can be rearranged to express the orbital distance in terms of temperature:\n    a ∝ 1 / T_eq²\n\n4.  **Relate Orbital Period to Orbital Distance:**\n    Kepler's Third Law states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a):\n    P² ∝ a³\n    This can be rewritten as:\n    P ∝ a^(3/2)\n    The mass of the planets is negligible compared to the star's mass and does not affect this relationship. Therefore, the information about planet masses and the TTV method is not needed for this calculation.\n\n5.  **Combine the Relationships to Find P vs. T_eq:**\n    Now we can combine the two relationships derived above to find a direct relationship between the orbital period (P) and the equilibrium temperature (T_eq).\n    We have P ∝ a^(3/2) and a ∝ 1 / T_eq².\n    Substitute the expression for 'a' into the expression for 'P':\n    P ∝ (1 / T_eq²)^(3/2)\n    P ∝ 1 / T_eq^(2 * 3/2)\n    P ∝ 1 / T_eq³\n    This crucial relationship shows that the orbital period is inversely proportional to the cube of the equilibrium temperature. For any two planets (x and y) in the system, the ratio of their periods is:\n    P_y / P_x = (T_eq_x / T_eq_y)³\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Ratio:**\n    We need to find P3 / P1. Using the formula from the previous step:\n    P3 / P1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)³\n    We are given the ratios T_eq1 / T_eq2 and T_eq2 / T_eq3. We can find T_eq1 / T_eq3 by multiplying these two ratios:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq3 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2) * (T_eq2 / T_eq3) = 1.4 * 2.3\n    Now, let's perform the final calculation.\n\n```python\n# Given ratios of equilibrium temperatures\nTeq1_over_Teq2 = 1.4\nTeq2_over_Teq3 = 2.3\n\n# The relationship between period (P) and equilibrium temperature (T_eq) is P ∝ 1/T_eq³.\n# Therefore, the ratio P3/P1 is equal to (T_eq1/T_eq3)³.\n\n# First, calculate the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq3\nTeq1_over_Teq3 = Teq1_over_Teq2 * Teq2_over_Teq3\n\n# Now, calculate the ratio of the orbital periods P3 / P1\nperiod_ratio_P3_over_P1 = Teq1_over_Teq3 ** 3\n\nprint(period_ratio_P3_over_P1)\n```\n<execute_result>\n33.386248000000005\n</execute_result>\nThe calculation shows that the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 by a factor of approximately 33.39.

    "Here's the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The primary objective is to determine the ratio of the orbital period of Planet3 to that of Planet1 (P₃ / P₁).\n\n2.  **Identify Key Physical Principles:**\n    *   **Planetary Equilibrium Temperature:** The temperature of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates into space. For a planet in a circular orbit, the equilibrium temperature (T_eq) is related to its orbital distance (semi-major axis, 'a') by the formula:\n        T_eq⁴ ∝ (1 - A) / a²\n        where 'A' is the albedo. Since all three planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, the term (1 - A) is a constant for all of them. This simplifies the relationship to:\n        T_eq⁴ ∝ 1 / a²\n        Taking the square root of both sides gives T_eq² ∝ 1/a, which can be rearranged to show the relationship for the orbital distance:\n        a ∝ 1 / T_eq²\n\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law:** This law relates a planet's orbital period (P) to its orbital distance (a). For planets orbiting the same star, the law states:\n        P² ∝ a³\n        This can be rewritten as:\n        P ∝ a^(3/2)\n\n    *   **Extraneous Information:** The problem provides the mass ratios between the planets and mentions the TTV method. The TTV (Transit Timing Variation) method uses gravitational interactions between planets to detect them and estimate their masses. However, for applying Kepler's Third Law in its standard form (where the star's mass is much greater than the planets' masses), the individual planet masses are not needed. The albedo value is also not needed for the final calculation since it is the same for all planets and thus cancels out in the ratios.\n\n3.  **Combine the Principles:** The goal is to find a direct relationship between the orbital period (P) and the equilibrium temperature (T_eq).\n    *   We have: P ∝ a^(3/2)\n    *   And we have: a ∝ 1 / T_eq²\n    *   Substitute the expression for 'a' into the expression for 'P':\n        P ∝ (1 / T_eq²)^(3/2)\n        P ∝ 1 / T_eq^(2 * 3/2)\n        P ∝ 1 / T_eq³\n    *   This gives us the crucial relationship: The orbital period is inversely proportional to the cube of the equilibrium temperature. For any two planets in the system (let's say planet 'x' and planet 'y'), the ratio of their periods is:\n        P_y / P_x = (T_eq_x / T_eq_y)³\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   We need to find P₃ / P₁. Using the formula from the previous step, we get:\n        P₃ / P₁ = (T_eq₁ / T_eq₃)³\n    *   We are not given the ratio T_eq₁ / T_eq₃ directly, but we can calculate it from the provided ratios:\n        T_eq₁ / T_eq₃ = (T_eq₁ / T_eq₂) * (T_eq₂ / T_eq₃)\n    *   Plugging in the given values:\n        T_eq₁ / T_eq₃ = 1.4 * 2.3\n    *   Now, we can calculate the final period ratio. The following Python code performs this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Given ratios of equilibrium temperatures\nTeq1_over_Teq2 = 1.4\nTeq2_over_Teq3 = 2.3\n\n# The relationship between period (P) and equilibrium temperature (T_eq) is P ∝ 1/T_eq³.\n# Therefore, the ratio of the periods P3/P1 is equal to (T_eq1/T_eq3)³.\n\n# First, calculate the ratio of the temperatures T_eq1 / T_eq3\nTeq1_over_Teq3 = Teq1_over_Teq2 * Teq2_over_Teq3\n\n# Now, cube this ratio to find the ratio of the orbital periods P3 / P1\nperiod_ratio_P3_over_P1 = Teq1_over_Teq3 ** 3\n\nprint(period_ratio_P3_over_P1)\n```\n<execute_result>\n33.386248000000005\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated factor is approximately 33.39.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1. This is the ratio P₃ / P₁.\n\n2.  **Relate Equilibrium Temperature to Orbital Distance:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the incoming radiation from its star and the outgoing thermal radiation. The formula is given by:\n    T_eq⁴ = [L_star * (1 - A)] / (16 * π * σ * a²)\n    where L_star is the star's luminosity, A is the albedo, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and 'a' is the semi-major axis (orbital distance).\n\n    Since all three planets orbit the same star (L_star is constant) and have the same albedo (A is constant), all terms except T_eq and 'a' are constant.
