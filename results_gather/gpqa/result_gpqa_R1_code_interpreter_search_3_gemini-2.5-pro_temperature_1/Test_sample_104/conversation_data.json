    "This problem requires us to compare the dimming of a star's light caused by two different phenomena: rotational modulation due to starspots and a transiting exoplanet. We need to find the relative size of an exoplanet that would produce the same amount of dimming as the starspots.\n\n**Step 1: Define the light curve amplitude due to starspots.**\n\nThe brightness of the star changes as it rotates, showing either its unspotted hemisphere or its spotted hemisphere to the observer. The amplitude of this variation is the difference in flux between the bright (unspotted) and dim (spotted) phases, relative to the maximum (bright) flux.\n\n*   Let F_bright be the flux when the unspotted hemisphere is facing the observer. This flux is proportional to the star's effective temperature to the fourth power, according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law (F ∝ T⁴). So, F_bright ∝ T_eff⁴.\n\n*   Let F_dim be the flux when the spotted hemisphere is facing the observer. This hemisphere has a fraction `f_spot` of its area covered by cooler spots. The flux is a weighted average of the flux from the normal photosphere and the spots.\n    *   The fraction of the area at temperature T_eff is (1 - f_spot).\n    *   The fraction of the area at temperature T_spot is f_spot.\n    *   Therefore, F_dim ∝ (1 - f_spot) * T_eff⁴ + f_spot * T_spot⁴.\n\n*   The amplitude (or depth, ΔF/F) of the signal is the relative drop in flux:\n    *   Amplitude_spots = (F_bright - F_dim) / F_bright\n    *   Amplitude_spots = 1 - (F_dim / F_bright)\n    *   Substituting the expressions for flux:\n        Amplitude_spots = 1 - [((1 - f_spot) * T_eff⁴ + f_spot * T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴]\n    *   Simplifying the expression:\n        Amplitude_spots = 1 - [(1 - f_spot) + f_spot * (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]\n        Amplitude_spots = 1 - 1 + f_spot - f_spot * (T_spot / T_eff)⁴\n        Amplitude_spots = f_spot * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)\n\n**Step 2: Define the light curve amplitude due to an exoplanet transit.**\n\nWhen a planet transits a star, it blocks a portion of the star's light. The depth of this transit is the ratio of the projected area of the planet to the projected area of the star.\n\n*   Amplitude_planet = (Area_planet / Area_star)\n*   Amplitude_planet = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²)\n*   Amplitude_planet = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\n**Step 3: Equate the two amplitudes and solve for the relative planet radius (R_pl / R_star).**\n\nWe are looking for the case where the signal from the planet is the same as the signal from the spots.\n\n*   Amplitude_planet = Amplitude_spots\n*   (R_pl / R_star)² = f_spot * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)\n*   R_pl / R_star = sqrt[ f_spot * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴) ]\n\n**Step 4: Plug in the given values and calculate the result.**\n\n*   Filling factor, f_spot = 20% = 0.20\n*   Effective temperature, T_eff = 6000 K\n*   Spot temperature, T_spot = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n\nNow, we can perform the calculation using a python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given parameters\nf_spot = 0.20\nT_eff = 6000.0\nT_spot = 5000.0\n\n# Calculate the amplitude of the signal due to spots\n# Amplitude_spots = f_spot * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\namplitude_spots = f_spot * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\n\n# The amplitude for a transiting exoplanet is (R_pl / R_star)**2\n# We set the two amplitudes to be equal:\n# (R_pl / R_star)**2 = amplitude_spots\n# Therefore, R_pl / R_star = sqrt(amplitude_spots)\nrelative_radius = math.sqrt(amplitude_spots)\n\nprint(relative_radius)\n```\n<execute_code>\n0.3217912440182582\n</execute_code>\nThe calculation shows that the relative radius of the hypothetical exoplanet is approximately 0.32.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem asks for the relative radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same dimming effect as a star with a heavily spotted hemisphere. We need to equate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots with the transit depth caused by the planet.\n\n**1.

The amplitude of this variation is the relative difference in flux.\n\n*   The flux (F) is proportional to the fourth power of the effective temperature (T), according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law (F ∝ T⁴).\n*   Let F_max be the flux from the unspotted hemisphere.

    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the Two Scenarios**\n\n*   **Scenario 1: Starspots.** The star's brightness varies because it rotates. When the hemisphere with dark, cool spots faces us, the star appears dimmer. When the unspotted, hotter hemisphere faces us, the star appears brighter. The \"amplitude\" of the signal is the maximum fractional drop in brightness.\n*   **Scenario 2: Exoplanet Transit.** A planet passes in front of a uniformly bright star, blocking a fraction of its light. The \"amplitude\" (or transit depth) is the fractional drop in brightness caused by the planet's silhouette.\n\n**2.

We can say `F_max ∝ T_eff⁴`.\n*   Let F_min be the flux from the dim, spotted side.
