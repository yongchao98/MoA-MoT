    "This problem involves a particle-antiparticle annihilation process. To solve it, we need to apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the Initial State:**\n    *   The initial state consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    *   The problem states that the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". This implies its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest energy. We can assume both the proton and antiproton are effectively at rest.\n    *   Therefore, the total initial momentum of the system is zero.\n    *   The total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n    *   The rest energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) is approximately 938.27 MeV. The antiproton has the same mass.\n    *   $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2$\n\n2.  **Analyze the Final State:**\n    *   The final state consists of four particles: two $A^{+}$ and two $A^{-}$.\n    *   The problem states the rest energy of particle A is $m_A c^2 = 300$ MeV. We assume $A^{+}$ and $A^{-}$ have the same mass.\n    *   So, the final state contains 4 particles, each with a rest energy of 300 MeV.\n    *   The total energy of a single A particle is given by the relativistic formula $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$ and $v$ is its velocity.\n    *   The total final energy ($E_{final}$) is the sum of the energies of the four A particles.\n\n3.  **Apply Conservation Laws:**\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial momentum is zero, the total final momentum must also be zero. The four A particles must fly off in directions such that their vector sum of momenta is zero. The most symmetric configuration, which is implied by the question asking for \"the velocity\" (a single value), is that all four particles have the same speed, $v$.\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:** The total initial energy must equal the total final energy.\n        $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n        $2 \\times m_p c^2 = E_{A1} + E_{A2} + E_{A3} + E_{A4}$\n        Since all four particles have the same mass and speed, they have the same energy:\n        $2 \\times m_p c^2 = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\times \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Velocity:**\n    *   We can now set up an equation to solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.\n        $2 \\times (938.27 \\text{ MeV}) = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times (300 \\text{ MeV})$\n        $1876.54 \\text{ MeV} = 1200 \\gamma \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   Solve for $\\gamma$:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{1876.54}{1200} \\approx 1.5638$\n    *   Now, we use the definition of $\\gamma$ to find the velocity $v$. Let $\\beta = v/c$.\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n        $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n        $1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    *   Substitute the value of $\\gamma$:\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n        $\\beta \\approx 0.7688$\n    *   Therefore, the velocity of each particle A is $v = 0.7688c$.\n\n5.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   The calculated value $v \\approx 0.77c$ matches option D.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, we can perform the calculation using a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Rest energy of a proton in MeV\nm_p_c2 = 938.272\n\n# Rest energy of particle A in MeV\nm_A_c2 = 300\n\n# The initial energy is the rest energy of the proton and antiproton\nE_initial = 2 * m_p_c2\n\n# The final energy is the total energy of the four A particles.\n# By energy conservation, E_initial = E_final = 4 * gamma * m_A_c2\n# We solve for the Lorentz factor, gamma.\ngamma = E_initial / (4 * m_A_c2)\n\n# Now we solve for beta (v/c) using the definition of gamma.\n# gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2) => beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2)\nbeta = math.sqrt(1 - 1 / (gamma**2))\n\nprint(f\"The calculated value of beta (v/c) is: {beta:.4f}\")\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
