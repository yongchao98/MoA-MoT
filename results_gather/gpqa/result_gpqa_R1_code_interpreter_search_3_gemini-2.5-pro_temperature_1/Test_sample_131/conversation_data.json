    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the given 1H NMR data**\n\nThe problem provides the following information about the 1H NMR spectrum of a 1:1 mixture of two compounds (both with the formula C10H14):\n\n1.  **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals.\n    *   Both are singlets.\n    *   The integration ratio is 1:1.\n2.  **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals.\n    *   All are singlets.\n    *   The integration ratio is 2:1:1.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds**\n\nWe need to analyze the structure and symmetry of each candidate molecule to predict the number of signals, their splitting patterns (multiplicity), and their relative integrations.\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring with methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a **single singlet with an integration of 2H**.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** All four methyl groups (at positions 1, 2, 4, 5) are chemically equivalent due to the symmetry. They will appear as a **single singlet with an integration of 12H**.\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H) and 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n2.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring with methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are adjacent but are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. Equivalent protons do not split each other, so they appear as a **single singlet with an integration of 2H**.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** The symmetry creates two sets of equivalent methyl groups:\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. This gives one signal: **1 singlet, 6H**.\n        *   The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent. This gives another signal: **1 singlet, 6H**.\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H) and 2 aliphatic singlets (6H each).\n\n3.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring with methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 3, and 5.\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has very low symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The proton at C4 (between two methyls) and the proton at C6 (between a methyl and a hydrogen) are in different chemical environments. They are non-equivalent and have no adjacent protons. This will result in **two separate singlets, each with an integration of 1H**.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are in unique chemical environments. This will result in **four separate singlets, each with an integration of 3H**.\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each) and 4 aliphatic singlets (3H each).\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring with ethyl groups at positions 1 and 4.\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four aromatic protons are equivalent, giving **1 singlet (4H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The ethyl group consists of a -CH2- (methylene) and a -CH3 (methyl) group. Protons on adjacent carbons will split each other (n+1 rule).\n        *   The -CH2- signal will be split into a quartet by the three protons of the -CH3 group.\n        *   The -CH3- signal will be split into a triplet by the two protons of the -CH2- group.\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:** The presence of quartets and triplets contradicts the problem statement that all observed signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the options based on the predicted spectra for a 1:1 mixture**\n\nNow we combine the predicted spectra for the remaining compounds to see which pair matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region (2 singlets, 1:1 ratio):**\n    *   We need to combine two compounds to get exactly two aromatic singlets with a 1:1 integration.\n    *   A mixture of **1,2,4,5-TMB** (1 singlet, 2H) and **1,2,3,4-TMB** (1 singlet, 2H) would produce two singlets in the aromatic region (assuming their chemical shifts are different). Since the mixture is 1:1 and both signals correspond to 2 protons, their integration ratio will be 2H:2H, which simplifies to 1:1. This is a perfect match.\n    *   Any mixture involving **1,2,3,5-TMB** (which has 2 aromatic singlets by itself) would result in at least 3 aromatic signals, which contradicts the data.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region (3 singlets, 2:1:1 ratio):**\n    *   Let's check our proposed pair: **1,2,4,5-TMB** and **1,2,3,4-TMB**.\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one aliphatic singlet with a relative integration of 12H.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two aliphatic singlets, each with a relative integration of 6H.\n    *   In total, the mixture gives three aliphatic singlets with integrations corresponding to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   The ratio of these integrations is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is also a perfect match.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only combination that matches both the aromatic and aliphatic 1H NMR data is a 1:1 mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",

The integrations are for 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   The integration ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the data.\n\nThis combination successfully explains all features of the given NMR spectrum. The other options would not work. For instance, any combination with 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene would produce at least three aromatic signals, which contradicts the data.\n\n<<<B>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\n\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\n\nIf you lack the related knowledge, you can use the Google Search Tool to search the web and get the information.\nYou can call a search query with the format of <search>your search query</search>, e.g., <search>Who is the current president of US?</search>. The searched results will be returned between <information> and </information>.\nOnce the search query is complete, stop the generation. Then, the search platform will return the searched results.\n\nIf you need to search the web, do not generate code in the same response. Vice versa. You can also solve the question without code and searching, just by your textual reasoning.\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code or search queries to solve the problem.\n\n    question: The 1H NMR spectrum of a solution containing a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14 exhibits two signals (two singlets) at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio.
