    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the information about substance A2 to identify element Y.**\n    The problem states that A2 is a binary fluoride of element Y (let's denote its formula as YF_n) and has a mass fraction of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96% (or 0.3196). The atomic mass of Fluorine (F) is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n    The formula for the mass fraction is:\n    ɷF = (n * Ar(F)) / (Ar(Y) + n * Ar(F))\n    0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (Ar(Y) + n * 19.00)\n    By rearranging the formula to solve for the atomic mass of Y (Ar(Y)), we get:\n    Ar(Y) = n * (19.00 / 0.3196 - 19.00)\n    Ar(Y) ≈ n * (59.45 - 19.00)\n    Ar(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\n\n    We can now test integer values for `n` (the number of fluorine atoms) to find a plausible atomic mass for element Y.\n    *   n = 1: Ar(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (closest is Calcium, Ar=40.08, or Scandium, Ar=44.96). These elements do not fit the other conditions (e.g., forming five fluorides, forming compounds that can oxidize xenon).\n    *   n = 2: Ar(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (closest is Bromine, Ar=79.9, or Selenium, Ar=78.97, or Krypton, Ar=83.80).\n    *   n = 3: Ar(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (closest is Antimony, Ar=121.76).\n    *   n = 4: Ar(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (no common element fits well).\n    *   n = 5: Ar(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (closest are Mercury, Ar=200.6, or Thallium, Ar=204.4).\n    *   n = 6: Ar(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (closest are actinides like Plutonium, Ar=244, or Americium, Ar=243).\n\n2.  **Evaluate the most promising candidates for Y.**\n    Let's check the candidates that have a good atomic mass match and are known to form multiple, highly reactive fluorides.\n    *   **Plutonium (Pu, n=6):** Ar(Pu-244) is 244.06. Required Ar(Y) is ~242.7. This is a very good match. Let's check ɷF for A2 = PuF6. ɷF = (6 * 19) / (244 + 6*19) = 114 / 358 ≈ 0.3184. Using precise masses gives an even better fit (0.31925). PuF6 is a very strong oxidizing agent. This hypothesis is strong but leads to contradictions later (the molecular weight of A4 does not match any of the options).\n    *   **Antimony (Sb, n=3):** Ar(Sb) is 121.76. Required Ar(Y) is ~121.35. This is also a very good match. Let's check ɷF for A2 = SbF3. ɷF = (3 * 19) / (121.76 + 3*19) = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 0.3188. This is also a very good fit. However, this hypothesis leads to contradictions with the properties of A1 (SbF5 is not red and is stable at 293 K).\n    *   **Krypton (Kr, n=2):** Ar(Kr) is 83.80. Required Ar(Y) is ~80.9. This match is not as precise as for Pu or Sb. Let's check ɷF for A2 = KrF2. ɷF = (2 * 19) / (83.8 + 2*19) = 38 / 121.8 ≈ 0.312. This value is off from 31.96% by about 2.4%, but let's consider it as a possibility if other clues fit.\n\n3.  **Test the Krypton (Kr) hypothesis against all the clues.**\n    Let's assume Y = Kr, despite the imperfect mass fraction match, and see if it resolves the puzzle.\n    *   **Element Y = Krypton (Kr).**\n    *   **A2 = KrF2.**\n    *   **A1:** The problem states A1 decomposes into A2 (KrF2) and fluorine. This means A1 must be KrF4.\n    *   **Properties of A1=KrF4:**\n        *   \"bright-red substance\": KrF4 is predicted to be a red solid. This fits.\n        *   \"decomposes at 293 K\": KrF4 is known to be very unstable, decomposing into KrF2 and F2 above -100 °C. So it would decompose at room temperature (293 K). This fits.\n        *   \"oxidizes xenon under normal conditions\": KrF4 is an extremely powerful oxidizing agent, much stronger than KrF2 or F2, and can oxidize xenon (e.g., to XeF6). This fits.\n    *   **A3:** It is obtained by fluorination of Y (Kr) with fluorine. This reaction produces KrF2. So, **A3 = KrF2**. The statement that A3 interacts with xenon is plausible, as KrF2 is a strong fluorinating agent.\n    *   **The crucial reaction for A4:** \"By adding Y (Kr) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n        *   The reaction is Kr + A4 → A5, where A5 is a binary fluoride of Kr (so, KrF2).\n        *   This means A4 must be a fluorinating agent that reacts with Kr in a 1:1 stoichiometry to produce KrF2.\n        *   Let's consider interhalogen compounds as candidates for A4. A potential reaction is: Kr + BrF5 → KrF2 + BrF3.\n        *   This reaction is chemically plausible and has the required 1:1 molar ratio of reactants.\n        *   Therefore, we can hypothesize that **A4 = BrF5** and **A5 = KrF2**.\n    *   **Properties of A4=BrF5:** Bromine pentafluoride (BrF5) is a colorless liquid, so its \"hot colorless concentrated solution\" (e.g., in HF) is perfectly plausible.\n    *   **Final clue for A5=KrF2:** \"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\" The hydrolysis of KrF2 is complex and yields Krypton (Kr), Oxygen (O2), and hydrofluoric acid (HF) – three substances. This is a weak point of the hypothesis, but it could be due to imprecise wording in the problem (e.g., counting only elemental products, Kr and O). Given how well all other points fit, we can proceed.\n\n4.  **Calculate the molecular weight of A4 and find the correct range.**\n    Based on our hypothesis, A4 is Bromine pentafluoride (BrF5).\n    *   Atomic mass of Bromine (Br) ≈ 79.90 g/mol.\n    *   Atomic mass of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol.\n    *   Molecular weight of A4 (BrF5) = Ar(Br) + 5 * Ar(F) = 79.90 + 5 * 19.00 = 79.90 + 95.00 = 174.90 g/mol.\n\n5.  **Compare the result with the given options.**\n    The calculated molecular weight is 174.90 g/mol. Let's check the ranges:\n    A) 140-160\n    B) 220-240\n    C) 110-130\n    D) 160-180\n\n    The value 174.90 falls within the range of 160-180.\n\nTo confirm the calculations:\n```python\ndef check_omega_F(element_Ar, n):\n    Ar_F = 18.9984\n    M_total = element_Ar + n * Ar_F\n    if M_total == 0:\n        return 0\n    omega_F = (n * Ar_F) / M_total\n    return omega_F\n\n# Check omega_F for KrF2\nomega_F_KrF2 = check_omega_F(83.798, 2)\n# print(f\"omega_F for KrF2: {omega_F_KrF2:.4f}\") # Output is ~0.3120, compared to 0.3196\n\n# Calculate MW of BrF5\nAr_Br = 79.904\nAr_F = 18.9984\nMW_BrF5 = Ar_Br + 5 * Ar_F\nprint(f\"Molecular Weight of BrF5: {MW_BrF5:.2f}\")\n\n```\nThe code output confirms the molecular weight of BrF5.\n`Molecular Weight of BrF5: 174.90`\n\nThis value falls into the range given in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y using Substance A2.**\n    The problem states that A2 is a binary fluoride of element Y (let's denote its formula as YF_n) and the mass fraction of fluorine (ɷF) is 31.96% or 0.3196. The atomic mass of Fluorine (F) is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n\n    The formula for the mass fraction of fluorine is:\n    ɷF = (n × Ar(F)) / (Ar(Y) + n × Ar(F))\n\n    We can rearrange this to solve for the atomic mass of Y, Ar(Y):\n    Ar(Y) = (n × Ar(F) / ɷF) - (n × Ar(F))\n    Ar(Y) = n × Ar(F) × (1/ɷF - 1)\n    Ar(Y) ≈ n × 19.00 × (1/0.3196 - 1)\n    Ar(Y) ≈ n × 19.00 × (3.129 - 1)\n    Ar(Y) ≈ n × 40.45\n\n    We can now test integer values of `n` to find a plausible element Y.\n    *   n = 1: Ar(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Calcium, Ca).\n    *   n = 2: Ar(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (close to Bromine, Br, or Krypton, Kr).\n    *   n = 3: Ar(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (very close to Antimony, Sb).\n    *   n = 6: Ar(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (close to Plutonium, Pu, or Uranium, U).\n\n2.  **Evaluate the candidates based on other chemical properties.**\n\n    *   **Antimony (Sb) hypothesis:** If n=3, Ar(Y) is 121.35 g/mol, which is an excellent match for Sb (121.76 g/mol). This would make A2 = SbF₃. The problem states that A1 decomposes into A2 (SbF₃) and F₂. This implies A1 would be SbF₅. However, SbF₅ is a colorless liquid that is stable at 293 K, not a \"bright-red substance\" that \"decomposes at 293 K\". This is a major contradiction.\n\n    *   **Krypton (Kr) hypothesis:** If n=2, Ar(Y) is 80.9 g/mol, which is reasonably close to Kr (83.80 g/mol). This would make A2 = KrF₂. Let's check the properties:\n        *   A1 decomposes into A2 (KrF₂) and F₂. This means **A1 = KrF₄**.\n        *   **Properties of A1 = KrF₄:**\n            *   It is described as a \"bright-red substance\". Theoretical calculations predict KrF₄ to be a red solid. This fits.\n            *   It \"decomposes at 293 K\". KrF₄ is known to be highly unstable, decomposing into KrF₂ and F₂ at temperatures above -100 °C (173 K). This fits perfectly with decomposition at room temperature (293 K).\n            *   It \"oxidizes xenon under normal conditions\". KrF₄ is an extremely powerful fluorinating agent and would readily oxidize xenon. This fits.\n        *   **A3** is obtained by fluorination of Y (Kr), which yields KrF₂. So, **A3 = KrF₂**. The statement that it interacts with xenon is also true.\n\n    The Krypton hypothesis fits all the chemical descriptions remarkably well, despite the slight numerical discrepancy in the mass percentage (calculated ɷF for KrF₂ is ~31.2%, vs. the given 31.96%). In chemistry problems of this nature, qualitative chemical properties often take precedence over a single numerical value that might contain an error. Thus, we proceed with **Y = Krypton**.\n\n3.  **Identify Substances A4 and A5.**\n    The problem describes the reaction: Y + A4 → A5, in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n    Substituting what we know: Kr + A4 → A5.\n    *   A5 is a binary fluoride of Krypton. Given the context, it's most likely the more stable fluoride, **A5 = KrF₂**.\n    *   The reaction is therefore **Kr + A4 → KrF₂**. This means A4 must be a strong fluorinating agent that can react with Krypton. A4 is described as a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\".\n    *   Interhalogen fluorides are excellent candidates for A4. Possible 1:1 reactions include:\n        *   Kr + BrF₅ → KrF₂ + BrF₃\n        *   Kr + IF₅ → KrF₂ + IF₃\n    *   Let's check the properties of the candidates for A4. Both BrF₅ and IF₅ are colorless liquids at room temperature and are powerful fluorinating agents.\n    *   To choose between them, we note that BrF₅ is a stronger fluorinating agent than IF₅, making it a more likely reactant for fluorinating a noble gas.\n\n4.  **Determine the Molecular Weight of A4.**\n    Based on the analysis, the most probable identity for A4 is Bromine pentafluoride (BrF₅). Let's calculate its molecular weight.\n    *   Atomic mass of Bromine (Br) ≈ 79.90 g/mol\n    *   Atomic mass of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n    *   Molecular Weight (MW) of BrF₅ = Ar(Br) + 5 × Ar(F) = 79.90 + 5 × 19.00 = 174.90 g/mol.\n\n    To verify with more precise masses:\n    ```python\n    # Using precise masses for calculation\n    # Ar(Br) = 79.904 g/mol\n    # Ar(F) = 18.9984 g/mol\n    mw_brf5 = 79.904 + 5 * 18.9984\n    print(f\"{mw_brf5:.2f}\")\n    ```\n    174.90\n\n5.  **Select the Correct Range.**\n    The calculated molecular weight of A4 (BrF₅) is 174.90 g/mol. We now compare this value to the given ranges:\n    A) 140-160\n    B) 220-240\n    C) 110-130\n    D) 160-180\n\n    The value 174.90 g/mol falls within the range of 160-180.\n\n<<<D>>>",

The atomic mass of Fluorine (F) is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n\n    The formula for the mass fraction is:\n    ɷF = (n × Ar(F)) / (Ar(Y) + n × Ar(F))\n\n    We can rearrange this formula to solve for the atomic mass of Y, Ar(Y):\n    Ar(Y) = n × Ar(F) × (1/ɷF - 1)\n    Ar(Y) ≈ n × 19.00 × (1/0.3196 - 1)\n    Ar(Y) ≈ n × 19.00 × (3.1289 - 1)\n    Ar(Y) ≈ n × 40.45\n\n    Let's test integer values for `n` to find a plausible atomic mass for a chemical element:\n    *   n = 1: Ar(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (Close to Calcium, but its chemistry doesn't fit).\n    *   n = 2: Ar(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (Close to Krypton, Kr, Ar=83.80).\n    *   n = 3: Ar(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (Very close to Antimony, Sb, Ar=121.76).\n    *   n = 6: Ar(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (Close to Plutonium, Pu, Ar≈244).\n\n2.  **Evaluate the candidates based on the chemical properties described.**\n    *   **Antimony (Sb) Hypothesis:** If Y=Sb, then A2=SbF₃. A1, which decomposes into A2 and F₂, must be SbF₅. However, the problem states A1 is a \"bright-red substance\" that \"decomposes at 293 K\". SbF₅ is a stable, colorless liquid. This is a direct contradiction.\n    *   **Krypton (Kr) Hypothesis:** If Y=Kr, then A2=KrF₂. The calculated mass percentage for KrF₂ is about 31.2%, which is slightly off from the given 31.96%, but the chemical properties provide a much stronger basis for identification.\n        *   **A1:** Decomposes into A2 (KrF₂) and F₂.

This fits perfectly.\n            *   \"oxidizes xenon under normal conditions\": KrF₄ is an extremely powerful fluorinating agent, capable of oxidizing xenon. This fits perfectly.\n    *   The krypton hypothesis aligns exceptionally well with the described chemical behaviors, making it the most plausible choice for element Y.\n\n3.  **Identify Substances A3, A4, and A5.**\n    *   **A3:** Obtained by fluorination of Y (Kr) with fluorine. This reaction yields **A3 = KrF₂**.\n    *   **A5:** Obtained from the reaction Y + A4 → A5, with a 1:1 molar ratio. Substituting Y=Kr and knowing A5 is a binary fluoride, we get Kr + A4 → A5 (likely KrF₂). So, **A5 = KrF₂**.\n    *   **A4:** The reaction is Kr + A4 → KrF₂. A4 must be a fluorinating agent that reacts 1:1 with Krypton. The problem states A4 is a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\". This points to a liquid interhalogen compound. A plausible and known reaction is:\n        Kr + BrF₅ → KrF₂ + BrF₃\n    *   This reaction fits the 1:1 stoichiometry.

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y using the Mass Fraction of Fluorine in Substance A2.**\n    The problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (YF_n) with a fluorine mass fraction (ɷF) of 31.96% (or 0.3196). The atomic mass of fluorine (Ar(F)) is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n\n    The formula for the mass fraction is:\n    ɷF = (n × Ar(F)) / (Ar(Y) + n × Ar(F))\n\n    We can rearrange this to solve for the atomic mass of Y (Ar(Y)):\n    Ar(Y) = n × Ar(F) × (1/ɷF - 1)\n    Ar(Y) ≈ n × 19.00 × (1/0.3196 - 1)\n    Ar(Y) ≈ n × 19.00 × (3.1289 - 1)\n    Ar(Y) ≈ n × 40.45\n\n    Now, we test integer values for `n` (the number of fluorine atoms) to find a plausible atomic mass for a known element:\n    *   n = 1: Ar(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (Close to Calcium, Ca).\n    *   n = 2: Ar(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (Close to Krypton, Kr, or Bromine, Br).\n    *   n = 3: Ar(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (Very close to Antimony, Sb).\n    *   n = 6: Ar(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (Close to Plutonium, Pu).\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Candidates using Chemical Properties.**\n    We must use the other clues to determine which candidate is correct. The properties of substance A1 are key. A1 is a \"bright-red substance\" that \"decomposes at 293 K\" into A2 and fluorine, and it \"oxidizes xenon\".\n\n    *   **Antimony (Sb) Hypothesis:** If Y=Sb, then A2=SbF₃ (since n=3). A1, which decomposes into A2 and F₂, would have to be SbF₅. However, SbF₅ is a stable, colorless liquid at room temperature (293 K). This contradicts the description of A1. So, Y is not Sb.\n    *   **Krypton (Kr) Hypothesis:** If Y=Kr, then A2=KrF₂ (since n=2). Let's check the properties:\n        *   A1 decomposes into A2 (KrF₂) and F₂. This means **A1 = KrF₄**.\n        *   Is KrF₄ a \"bright-red substance\"? KrF₄ is a volatile solid that has been described as having a reddish color. This is a good fit.\n        *   Does KrF₄ \"decompose at 293 K\"? Yes, KrF₄ is extremely unstable and decomposes at temperatures above -100 °C (173 K). It would certainly decompose at room temperature (293 K). This is a perfect fit.\n        *   Does KrF₄ \"oxidize xenon\"? Yes, KrF₄ is an exceptionally powerful fluorinating agent, much stronger than fluorine gas, and can easily oxidize xenon. This is a perfect fit.\n    *   The Krypton hypothesis aligns perfectly with the chemical properties described for A1 and its decomposition, despite a minor numerical discrepancy in the mass percentage of A2. Therefore, we conclude **Y = Krypton (Kr)**.\n\n3.  **Identify the Remaining Substances.**\n    *   **A3:** It is obtained by the fluorination of Y (Kr), so Kr + F₂ → KrF₂. Thus, **A3 = KrF₂**.\n    *   **A5 and A4:** A5 is formed by adding Y (Kr) to A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio: Kr + A4 → A5. A5 is a binary fluoride of krypton, most likely the more stable one, **A5 = KrF₂**. The reaction is therefore Kr + A4 → KrF₂. A4 is described as a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\". This suggests A4 is a powerful liquid fluorinating agent. An interhalogen compound fits this description. A plausible reaction with 1:1 stoichiometry is:\n        Kr + BrF₅ → KrF₂ + BrF₃\n    *   This reaction is chemically sound. Bromine pentafluoride (BrF₅) is a colorless liquid and a potent fluorinating agent. Thus, it is the most likely candidate for **A4 = BrF₅**.\n    *   The final clue is that A5 (KrF₂) decomposes in water. Indeed, KrF₂ hydrolyzes to form Kr, O₂, and HF.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4.**\n    Having identified A4 as Bromine pentafluoride (BrF₅), we can now calculate its molecular weight.\n\n    ```python\n    # Atomic mass of Bromine (Br) is 79.904 g/mol\n    # Atomic mass of Fluorine (F) is 18.9984 g/mol\n    mw_brf5 = 79.904 + 5 * 18.9984\n    print(f\"{mw_brf5:.2f}\")\n    ```\n    174.90\n\n5.  **Determine the Correct Range.**\n    The calculated molecular weight of A4 (BrF₅) is 174.90 g/mol.

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y using the Mass Fraction of Fluorine in Substance A2.**\n    The problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (YF_n) with a fluorine mass fraction (ɷF) of 31.96% (or 0.3196). The atomic mass of fluorine (Ar(F)) is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n\n    The formula for the mass fraction is:\n    ɷF = (n × Ar(F)) / (Ar(Y) + n × Ar(F))\n\n    We can rearrange this formula to solve for the atomic mass of Y (Ar(Y)):\n    Ar(Y) = n × Ar(F) × (1/ɷF - 1)\n    Ar(Y) ≈ n × 19.00 × (1/0.3196 - 1)\n    Ar(Y) ≈ n × 19.00 × (3.1289 - 1)\n    Ar(Y) ≈ n × 40.45\n\n    Now, we test integer values for `n` (the number of fluorine atoms) to find a plausible atomic mass for a known element:\n    *   n = 2: Ar(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (Close to Krypton, Kr, with Ar=83.8 g/mol).\n    *   n = 3: Ar(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (Very close to Antimony, Sb, with Ar=121.76 g/mol).\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Candidates using Chemical Properties.**\n    We must use the other clues to determine which candidate is correct. The properties of substance A1 are key. A1 is a \"bright-red substance\" that \"decomposes at 293 K\" into A2 and fluorine, and it \"oxidizes xenon\".\n\n    *   **Antimony (Sb) Hypothesis:** If Y=Sb, then A2=SbF₃ (since n=3 fits the mass perfectly). A1, which decomposes into A2 and F₂, would have to be SbF₅. However, SbF₅ is a stable, colorless liquid at room temperature (293 K). This directly contradicts the description of A1 as a \"bright-red substance\" that \"decomposes at 293 K\". Therefore, Y is not Antimony.\n\n    *   **Krypton (Kr) Hypothesis:** If Y=Kr, then A2=KrF₂ (for n=2). Although the mass calculation isn't perfect (calculated ɷF is ~31.2%), let's check the chemical properties.\n        *   **A1:** Decomposes into A2 (KrF₂) and F₂. This means **A1 = KrF₄**.\n        *   Let's check the properties of A1 = KrF₄ against the clues:\n            *   \"bright-red substance\": KrF₄ has been reported as a red solid. This is a good fit.\n            *   \"decomposes at 293 K\": KrF₄ is known to be extremely unstable, decomposing at temperatures above -100 °C (173 K). It would certainly decompose at room temperature (293 K). This is a perfect fit.\n            *   \"oxidizes xenon under normal conditions\": KrF₄ is an exceptionally powerful fluorinating agent, much stronger than fluorine gas, and can easily oxidize xenon. This is a perfect fit.\n    *   Conclusion: The Krypton hypothesis aligns perfectly with the chemical properties described for A1. In such problems, distinctive chemical properties are often more reliable than a single numerical value which may have a typo. We proceed with **Y = Krypton (Kr)**.\n\n3.  **Identify the Remaining Substances.**\n    *   **A3:** It is obtained by the fluorination of Y (Kr), so Kr + F₂ → KrF₂. Thus, **A3 = KrF₂**.\n    *   **A5 and A4:** A5 is formed by adding Y (Kr) to A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio: Kr + A4 → A5. A5 is a binary fluoride of krypton, most likely the more stable one, **A5 = KrF₂**. The reaction is therefore Kr + A4 → KrF₂. A4 is described as a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\". This suggests A4 is a powerful liquid fluorinating agent. An interhalogen compound fits this description. A plausible reaction with 1:1 stoichiometry is:\n        Kr + BrF₅ → KrF₂ + BrF₃\n    *   This reaction is chemically sound. Bromine pentafluoride (BrF₅) is a colorless liquid and a potent fluorinating agent, strong enough to react with an inert gas. Thus, it is a very strong candidate for **A4 = BrF₅**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4.**\n    Having identified A4 as Bromine pentafluoride (BrF₅), we can now calculate its molecular weight.\n\n    ```python\n    # Atomic mass of Bromine (Br) is 79.904 g/mol\n    # Atomic mass of Fluorine (F) is 18.9984 g/mol\n    mw_brf5 = 79.904 + 5 * 18.9984\n    print(f\"{mw_brf5:.2f}\")\n    ```\n    174.90\n\n5.  **Determine the Correct Range.**\n    The calculated molecular weight of A4 (BrF₅) is 174.90 g/mol. We compare this value to the given options:\n    A) 140-160\n    B) 220-240\n    C) 110-130\n    D) 160-180\n\n    The value 174.90 g/mol falls within the range of 160-180.\n\n<<<D>>>"
