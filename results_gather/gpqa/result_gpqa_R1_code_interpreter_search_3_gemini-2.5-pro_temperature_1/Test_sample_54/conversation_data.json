    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Total Number of Protons\nFirst, let's sum the integrations given in the 1H NMR data to find the total number of protons in the molecule.\nIntegration = 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8 protons.\n\nNow, let's determine the number of protons in each of the possible compounds:\n*   **Propenyl acetate (C5H8O2):** The propenyl group (C3H5) has 5 protons, and the acetate group (CH3CO) has 3 protons. Total = 5 + 3 = 8 protons.\n*   **Butenyl acetate (C6H10O2):** The butenyl group (C4H7) has 7 protons, and the acetate group (CH3CO) has 3 protons. Total = 7 + 3 = 10 protons.\n\nSince the 1H NMR data indicates a total of 8 protons, the unknown compound must be a propenyl acetate. This eliminates options A (Cis-butenyl acetate) and D (Trans-butenyl acetate).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Signals for Propenyl Acetate\nWe are now left with two possibilities: Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate. Let's analyze the structure of propenyl acetate and predict its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\nThe structure is: **CH3(a)-CH(b)=CH(c)-O-C(=O)CH3(d)**\n\nLet's assign the signals from the data to the protons in the structure:\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** This is a singlet integrating to 3 protons. This is characteristic of the methyl protons of an acetate group, **CH3(d)**, which have no adjacent protons to couple with.\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This is a doublet integrating to 3 protons. This corresponds to the methyl group attached to the double bond, **CH3(a)**. It is split into a doublet by the single adjacent vinylic proton, **H(b)**.\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)** and **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** These are the two vinylic protons, **H(b)** and **H(c)**.\n    *   The proton **H(c)** is attached to a carbon bonded to an electronegative oxygen atom, which deshields it significantly. Therefore, it will appear further downfield. We assign **H(c)** to the signal at **7.0 ppm**. This proton is coupled only to **H(b)**, so it appears as a doublet (d).\n    *   The proton **H(b)** is coupled to **H(c)** (giving a doublet) and also to the three protons of the methyl group **CH3(a)** (giving a quartet). Therefore, its signal will be a doublet of quartets (dq). We assign **H(b)** to the signal at **5.5 ppm**.\n\nThe assignments are consistent with the structure of propenyl acetate.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans)\nThe key to distinguishing between the cis and trans isomers is the magnitude of the coupling constant (J) between the two vinylic protons, H(b) and H(c).\n\n*   For a **trans** configuration, the protons are on opposite sides of the double bond, and the vicinal coupling constant (³J_trans) is typically large, in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n*   For a **cis** configuration, the protons are on the same side of the double bond, and the vicinal coupling constant (³J_cis) is smaller, in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n\nThe data for the vinylic proton H(c) at 7.0 ppm shows a coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz**. This value falls squarely within the typical range for a trans-coupling.\n\n### Conclusion\n1.  The proton count (8H) indicates the compound is propenyl acetate.\n2.  The chemical shifts and splitting patterns match the structure of propenyl acetate.\n3.  The large coupling constant of 16.0 Hz between the vinylic protons is definitive evidence for a **trans** configuration of the double bond.\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Total Number of Protons:** The first step is to sum the integrations from the 1H NMR data to determine the total number of hydrogen atoms in the molecule.\n    *   Integration = 1H (from 7.0 ppm) + 1H (from 5.5 ppm) + 3H (from 2.1 ppm) + 3H (from 1.6 ppm) = 8 protons.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Candidate Molecules:** Now, let's determine the number of protons for each of the possible answers.\n    *   **Propenyl acetate (C5H8O2):** The molecular formula tells us there are 8 hydrogen atoms. This matches our data.\n    *   **Butenyl acetate (C6H10O2):** The molecular formula tells us there are 10 hydrogen atoms. This does not match our data.\n    *   Based on the total proton count, we can immediately eliminate the butenyl acetate options: A) Cis-butenyl acetate and D) Trans-butenyl acetate. We are left with B) Cis-propenyl acetate and C) Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n3.  **Assign the NMR Signals to the Structure of Propenyl Acetate:**\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH₃. Let's label the protons for easier reference:\n        CH₃(a)-CH(b)=CH(c)-O-C(=O)-CH₃(d)\n    *   **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):** A singlet (s) for 3 protons around 2 ppm is a classic signature for the methyl group of an acetate ester (CH₃(d)). It's a singlet because there are no protons on the adjacent carbonyl carbon or oxygen atom.\n    *   **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):** A doublet (d) for 3 protons suggests a methyl group (CH₃(a)) coupled to a single adjacent proton (CH(b)).\n    *   **Signals at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm:** These are the two vinylic protons (on the C=C double bond), H(b) and H(c).\n        *   Proton H(c) is bonded to a carbon that is attached to an electronegative oxygen atom. This causes significant deshielding, shifting its signal far downfield. Therefore, the signal at **7.0 ppm** corresponds to **H(c)**. It is coupled to the adjacent H(b), so it appears as a doublet (d).\n        *   Proton H(b) is coupled to H(c) (one proton) and the CH₃(a) group (three protons). Coupling to one proton splits the signal into a doublet, and further coupling to three protons splits each line of the doublet into a quartet. The resulting pattern is a doublet of quartets (dq). This matches the signal at **5.5 ppm**.\n\n4.  **Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans):** The key to differentiating between the cis and trans isomers is the magnitude of the coupling constant (J) between the two vinylic protons, H(b) and H(c).\n    *   For **trans** isomers, where the vinylic protons are on opposite sides of the double bond, the coupling constant (³J_trans) is typically large, in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n    *   For **cis** isomers, where the vinylic protons are on the same side of the double bond, the coupling constant (³J_cis) is smaller, in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n    *   The 1H NMR data shows that the signal at 7.0 ppm (H(c)) is a doublet with a coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz**. This large value falls squarely in the typical range for a trans coupling.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The total proton count points to propenyl acetate. The chemical shifts and splitting patterns are consistent with this structure. The large coupling constant of 16.0 Hz is definitive evidence for a trans configuration around the double bond. Therefore, the unknown compound is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<C>>>",

This corresponds to the methyl group attached to the double bond.\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz) and 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** These two signals correspond to the two protons on the double bond (-CH=CH-).\n    *   The proton attached to the carbon bonded to the electronegative oxygen atom (-CH=CH-**O**-) will be significantly deshielded and appear further downfield. Thus, the signal at **7.0 ppm** is this proton. It is coupled to the other vinyl proton, so it appears as a doublet (d).\n    *   The other vinyl proton (-CH₃-**CH**=CH-) appears at **5.5 ppm**.

The resulting pattern is a doublet of quartets (dq).\n\nThe assignments are fully consistent with the structure of propenyl acetate.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans)\nThe final step is to use the coupling constant (J) to distinguish between the cis and trans isomers. The coupling constant between two protons on a double bond is highly dependent on their geometric relationship.\n*   For a **trans** configuration (protons on opposite sides), the vicinal coupling constant (³J) is typically large, in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n*   For a **cis** configuration (protons on the same side), the vicinal coupling constant (³J) is smaller, in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n\nThe data for the signal at 7.0 ppm shows a coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz**. This value is large and falls squarely within the typical range for a **trans** arrangement.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe proton count (8H) confirms the molecule is a propenyl acetate.
