    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   Let the formula of Z be CnHm. The mass fraction of hydrogen is `m / (12n + m)`.\n    *   `m / (12n + m) = 0.1428`\n    *   `m = 0.1428 * (12n + m) = 1.7136n + 0.1428m`\n    *   `0.8572m = 1.7136n`\n    *   `m/n ≈ 2.0`\n    *   This gives an empirical formula of CH2.\n    *   The general formula is (CH2)n or CnH2n.\n    *   Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (it does not react further with hydrogen) and is a liquid solvent. An alkene (CnH2n) is unsaturated. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in a cycloalkane CnH2n is `2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857`, which matches the given value.\n    *   Z is a widely used solvent. Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclohexane (C6H12) and methylcyclohexane (C7H14). Both fit the formula CnH2n.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, C and D.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water, which means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Z is a constituent of Y. Let's assume C = Z.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z. This means hydrogenation of D must also yield Z.\n    *   Since D does not decolorize bromine water, it's not a typical alkene/alkyne. For it to be hydrogenated to Z, it must be an aromatic compound with the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n    *   So, Y is a mixture of a cycloalkane (Z) and an aromatic hydrocarbon (D).\n    *   Let's test our two possibilities for Z:\n        *   **Case 1 (n=6):** Z is cyclohexane (C6H12). D must be an aromatic C6 hydrocarbon, which is benzene (C6H6). So, Y = {cyclohexane, benzene}.\n        *   **Case 2 (n=7):** Z is methylcyclohexane (C7H14). D must be an aromatic C7 hydrocarbon, which is toluene (C7H8). So, Y = {methylcyclohexane, toluene}.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction and Mixture X**\n    *   Mixture X (equimolar, A+B) undergoes disproportionation to form equimolar mixture Y (C+D). This is a hydrogen transfer reaction where one component is reduced and the other is oxidized.\n    *   `A + B -> C + D`\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms must be conserved: `H(A) + H(B) = H(C) + H(D)`.\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which is `H(A) + H(B)`. Therefore, we need to calculate `H(C) + H(D)`.\n    *   Let's calculate this for our two cases:\n        *   **Case 1 (n=6):** Y = {cyclohexane (C6H12), benzene (C6H6)}. Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n        *   **Case 2 (n=7):** Y = {methylcyclohexane (C7H14), toluene (C7H8)}. Total H atoms = 14 + 8 = 22.\n    *   The possible answers are 18 and 22, which correspond to options D and B.\n\n4.  **Distinguish Between the Two Cases**\n    *   Both cases are chemically plausible. We need to find a deciding factor.\n    *   Let's verify the full reaction for both cases.\n        *   **Case 1 (n=6):** H(A) + H(B) = 18. The components A and B must hydrogenate to cyclohexane (C6H12). They must be unsaturated and non-conjugated. A good choice would be cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n            *   H(A) + H(B) = 10 + 8 = 18. This fits.\n            *   Hydrogenation: C6H10 -> C6H12; C6H8 -> C6H12. This fits.\n            *   Reaction: C6H10 + C6H8 -> C6H12 + C6H6. This represents a transfer of 4 hydrogen atoms from the cyclohexene molecule (oxidizing it to benzene) to the cyclohexadiene molecule (reducing it to cyclohexane). This is a plausible disproportionation reaction. *Correction*: The H transfer is more likely to be 2H atoms. C6H10 (cyclohexene) loses 2H to become C6H8 (diene), which in turn loses 2H to become C6H6 (benzene). C6H8 (diene) gains 2H to become C6H10 (ene), which gains 2H to become C6H12 (alkane). A direct reaction C6H10 + C6H8 -> C6H12 + C6H6 is balanced (18H -> 18H) and represents a transfer of 4H from one molecule to the other. This scenario is fully consistent.\n        *   **Case 2 (n=7):** H(A) + H(B) = 22. A and B are likely a methylcyclohexene (C7H12) and a methylcyclohexadiene (C7H10).\n            *   H(A) + H(B) = 12 + 10 = 22. This fits.\n            *   Reaction: C7H12 + C7H10 -> C7H14 + C7H8. This represents a transfer of 2 hydrogen atoms from the diene (C7H10 -> C7H8) to the monoene (C7H12 -> C7H14). This scenario is also fully consistent.\n    *   Since both cases are chemically valid, we must rely on the hint \"widely used as a solvent\". Cyclohexane is arguably a more fundamental and widely used solvent in general chemistry than methylcyclohexane. Textbooks and standard problems often use the simplest parent compounds (C6 rings) to illustrate principles. This makes the n=6 case the most probable intended answer.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion**\n    *   Assuming the n=6 case is the correct one, Z is cyclohexane and Y is a mixture of cyclohexane and benzene.\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in the product mixture Y is 12 (from cyclohexane) + 6 (from benzene) = 18.\n    *   By conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactant mixture X (one molecule of A + one molecule of B) must also be 18.\n    *   The two liquids in mixture X would be cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). The sum of hydrogens is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "1.  **Determine the nature and formula of substance Z.**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon. Let its molecular formula be CxHy.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is given as 14.28%, or 0.1428.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as `(mass of H) / (total mass) = (y * 1.008) / (x * 12.011 + y * 1.008)`. Using integer masses for simplicity (12 for C, 1 for H), the formula is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   So, `y / (12x + y) = 0.1428`.\n    *   Let's rearrange the equation to find the ratio of y to x:\n        `y = 0.1428 * (12x + y)`\n        `y = 1.7136x + 0.1428y`\n        `y - 0.1428y = 1.7136x`\n        `0.8572y = 1.7136x`\n        `y / x = 1.7136 / 0.8572 ≈ 2.0`\n    *   This means the empirical formula for Z is CH2. The general formula is (CH2)n, or CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, which means it is a saturated compound.\n    *   A saturated hydrocarbon with the general formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane. The mass fraction of hydrogen in any cycloalkane CnH2n is `2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857`, which matches the given data perfectly.\n    *   So, Z is a cycloalkane.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y and its components.**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them C and D.\n    *   Y is formed from X and does not decolorize bromine water. This indicates that its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Z is a constituent of mixture Y. Let's assume C = Z. So, C is a cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z. This means `C + H2 → Z` and `D + H2 → Z`.\n    *   Since C is Z (a saturated cycloalkane), the first reaction is trivial.\n    *   The second reaction, `D + H2 → Z`, tells us that D can be hydrogenated to Z. Since D does not decolorize bromine water, it's not a typical alkene or alkyne. The most common type of compound that fits this description is an aromatic hydrocarbon that has the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n    *   Therefore, mixture Y consists of a cycloalkane (Z, formula CnH2n) and an aromatic hydrocarbon (D, which hydrogenates to Z).\n\n3.  **Identify the specific compounds.**\n    *   Z is described as a \"widely used as a solvent\". The simplest and most common cycloalkane solvents are cyclohexane (C6H12) and methylcyclohexane (C7H14). Let's examine these two possibilities.\n    *   **Case 1: Z is cyclohexane (C6H12).**\n        *   If Z is cyclohexane (C6H12, n=6), then D must be an aromatic C6 hydrocarbon that hydrogenates to cyclohexane. This is benzene (C6H6).\n        *   So, mixture Y = {cyclohexane (C6H12), benzene (C6H6)}. This pair fits the description.\n    *   **Case 2: Z is methylcyclohexane (C7H14).**\n        *   If Z is methylcyclohexane (C7H14, n=7), then D must be an aromatic C7 hydrocarbon that hydrogenates to methylcyclohexane. This is toluene (methylbenzene, C7H8).\n        *   So, mixture Y = {methylcyclohexane (C7H14), toluene (C7H8)}. This pair also fits the description.\n\n4.  **Analyze Mixture X and the reaction.**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B. It is converted into the equimolar mixture Y.\n    *   `Mixture X (A + B) --(Pt, heat)→ Mixture Y (C + D)`\n    *   This is a disproportionation reaction, which involves the transfer of hydrogen atoms. The total number of atoms of each element must be conserved between the initial and final mixtures.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A plus one molecule of B must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of C plus one molecule of D.\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which is `H_atoms(A) + H_atoms(B)`.\n    *   This sum is equal to `H_atoms(C) + H_atoms(D)`.\n    *   Let's calculate this sum for our two cases:\n        *   **Case 1 (C6 compounds):** Total H atoms = H(cyclohexane) + H(benzene) = 12 + 6 = 18.\n        *   **Case 2 (C7 compounds):** Total H atoms = H(methylcyclohexane) + H(toluene) = 14 + 8 = 22.\n    *   Both 18 (Option D) and 22 (Option B) are possible answers. We need to decide between the C6 and C7 cases. Both are chemically plausible. The disproportionation of cyclohexadienes or cyclohexenes to cyclohexane and benzene is a known reaction (Zelinsky-Kazansky reaction). A similar reaction can occur with methyl-substituted rings. Without further information, and given that cyclohexane/benzene is the most fundamental and classic example of this type of chemistry, it is the most likely intended answer in a general chemistry problem.\n\n5.  **Confirm the choice and conclude.**\n    *   Let's assume the C6 case is the intended one.\n    *   Mixture Y = {cyclohexane (C6H12), benzene (C6H6)}.\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in mixture Y is 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   By conservation of matter, the total number of hydrogen atoms in mixture X must also be 18.\n    *   We can even find plausible candidates for A and B. They must be unsaturated C6 rings that hydrogenate to cyclohexane, decolorize bromine water, and are non-conjugated. For example, A could be cyclohexene (C6H10) and B could be 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   The sum of hydrogens is 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   The reaction `A + B → C + D` is a conceptual representation of the overall transformation of the mixture. The number of atoms is conserved between the equimolar mixtures.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is the same as in mixture Y, which is 18.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "1.  **Analyze Substance Z:**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28% (or 0.1428). Let its formula be CₓHᵧ.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula: `Mass Fraction H = (Total Mass of H) / (Total Molar Mass) = y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   `y / (12x + y) = 0.1428`\n    *   Rearranging to find the ratio of y to x:\n        `y = 0.1428 * (12x + y)`\n        `y = 1.7136x + 0.1428y`\n        `y - 0.1428y = 1.7136x`\n        `0.8572y = 1.7136x`\n        `y/x = 1.7136 / 0.8572 ≈ 2`\n    *   The empirical formula of Z is CH₂, so its general molecular formula is CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   Z is described as not reacting further with hydrogen, meaning it is a saturated hydrocarbon.\n    *   A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a cycloalkane. An open-chain alkane has the formula CₙH₂ₙ₊₂.\n    *   Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them C and D.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water, which means its components are saturated (like alkanes/cycloalkanes) or aromatic.\n    *   Z is a constituent of Y. Let's say C = Z, so C is a cycloalkane (CₙH₂ₙ).\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z. This means both C and D, upon hydrogenation, yield Z.\n    *   Since C is Z, its \"hydrogenation\" is trivial.\n    *   For D, it must be hydrogenated to Z (`D + H₂ → Z`). Since D does not decolorize bromine water, it's not a typical unsaturated compound like an alkene. This profile fits an aromatic hydrocarbon, which doesn't react with bromine water but can be hydrogenated under severe conditions to form a cycloalkane with the same carbon skeleton.\n    *   So, mixture Y consists of a cycloalkane (Z, CₙH₂ₙ) and an aromatic hydrocarbon (D).\n\n3.  **Identify the specific compounds:**\n    *   Z is described as a \"widely used as a solvent\". The most common and simple cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). Let's assume Z is cyclohexane.\n    *   If Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), then D must be the corresponding aromatic hydrocarbon with 6 carbon atoms, which is benzene (C₆H₆).\n    *   So, Mixture Y = {cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), benzene (C₆H₆)}.\n\n4.  **Relate Mixture X to Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture X (an equimolar mixture of A and B) is converted to Mixture Y (an equimolar mixture of C and D) in a process described as disproportionation. This is a hydrogen transfer reaction.\n    *   The reaction can be conceptually written as: `A + B → C + D`.\n    *   Due to the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms of each element must be the same in the reactants (Mixture X) and the products (Mixture Y).\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which is the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B.\n    *   This sum must be equal to the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of C and one molecule of D.\n\n5.  **Calculate the total number of hydrogen atoms:**\n    *   Based on our identification, C = cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and D = benzene (C₆H₆).\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms in Mixture Y = (H atoms in C) + (H atoms in D)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 (from cyclohexane) + 6 (from benzene) = 18.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is also 18.\n\n6.  **Consistency Check:**\n    *   The components of X (A and B) must be unsaturated C₆ cyclic hydrocarbons that hydrogenate to cyclohexane (Z). They must also be non-conjugated.\n    *   For their total hydrogen count to be 18, we can propose A = cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and B = 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n    *   The sum of hydrogens is 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   Both decolorize bromine water.\n    *   1,4-cyclohexadiene is non-conjugated (unlike its isomer 1,3-cyclohexadiene).\n    *   The reaction `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` represents the hydrogen transfer (disproportionation), where the diene is oxidized to benzene and the ene is reduced to the alkane.\n    *   All conditions are met.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<D>>>",

This is the sum of H atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B.\n    *   Due to the conservation of atoms, this sum must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture Y (one molecule of C and one molecule of D).\n    *   Total H atoms in Mixture Y = (H atoms in cyclohexane) + (H atoms in benzene)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is also 18.\n\nTo confirm this, we can check the properties of mixture X. It must contain two unsaturated C₆ cyclic compounds (A and B) that are non-conjugated. For example, A could be cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and B could be 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈). The sum of their hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18, which matches our result. Both decolorize bromine water, and 1,4-cyclohexadiene is non-conjugated. All conditions of the problem are satisfied.\n\n<<<D>>>"

Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y in the presence of platinum under rather severe conditions gives only one substance, a certain hydrocarbon Z (mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%), which is a constituent of mixture Y and widely used as a solvent. Substance Z does not react further with hydrogen. There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X.\nIndicate the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X.\n\nA) 12\nB) 22\nC) 16\nD) 18\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n",
