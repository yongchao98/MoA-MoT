    "This problem requires calculating the relative concentration of a specific complex, dithiocyanato cobalt(II) or `[Co(SCN)2]`, in a solution containing multiple cobalt-thiocyanate complexes in equilibrium.\n\n**1. Understand the System and Equilibria**\n\nIn the solution, cobalt(II) ions (`Co^2+`) react with thiocyanate ions (`SCN-`) to form a series of complexes. The equilibria are described by the overall stability constants (β):\n\n*   `Co^2+ + SCN- ⇌ [Co(SCN)]^+`\n    *   `β₁ = [[Co(SCN)]^+] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]) = 9`\n*   `Co^2+ + 2SCN- ⇌ [Co(SCN)2]`\n    *   `β₂ = [[Co(SCN)2]] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]^2) = 40`\n*   `Co^2+ + 3SCN- ⇌ [Co(SCN)3]^-`\n    *   `β₃ = [[Co(SCN)3]^-] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]^3) = 63`\n*   `Co^2+ + 4SCN- ⇌ [Co(SCN)4]^2-`\n    *   `β₄ = [[Co(SCN)4]^2-] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]^4) = 16`\n\n**2. Define the Total Cobalt Concentration**\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all species containing cobalt:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [[Co(SCN)]^+] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]^-] + [[Co(SCN)4]^2-]`\n\n**3. Express Species Concentrations in Terms of `[Co^2+]`**\n\nUsing the stability constant expressions, we can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration, `[Co^2+]`, and the free ligand concentration, `[SCN-]`:\n\n*   `[[Co(SCN)]^+] = β₁[Co^2+][SCN-]`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)2]] = β₂[Co^2+][SCN-]^2`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)3]^-] = β₃[Co^2+][SCN-]^3`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)4]^2-] = β₄[Co^2+][SCN-]^4`\n\nSubstituting these into the total cobalt concentration equation:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β₁[SCN-] + β₂[SCN-]^2 + β₃[SCN-]^3 + β₄[SCN-]^4)`\n\n**4. Calculate the Mole Fraction (α) of the Desired Complex**\n\nThe percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, is its mole fraction (α₂) multiplied by 100. The mole fraction is the concentration of the specific complex divided by the total cobalt concentration.\n\n`α₂ = [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)`\n\n`α₂ = (β₂[Co^2+][SCN-]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β₁[SCN-] + β₂[SCN-]^2 + β₃[SCN-]^3 + β₄[SCN-]^4))`\n\nThe `[Co^2+]` term cancels out, simplifying the expression:\n\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN-]^2) / (1 + β₁[SCN-] + β₂[SCN-]^2 + β₃[SCN-]^3 + β₄[SCN-]^4)`\n\n**5. Perform the Calculation**\n\nWe are given:\n*   `[SCN-] = 0.1 M` (We will use the total concentration as an approximation for the free ligand concentration, which is standard for such problems unless the ligand is not in large excess).\n*   `β₁=9`, `β₂=40`, `β₃=63`, `β₄=16`\n\nNow, let's plug these values into the formula for α₂.\n\n```python\n# Given values\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nSCN_conc = 0.1  # [SCN-] in M\n\n# Numerator for the fraction of [Co(SCN)2]\nnumerator = beta2 * (SCN_conc)**2\n\n# Denominator (sum of all species terms)\n# The terms correspond to Co^2+, [Co(SCN)]+, [Co(SCN)2], [Co(SCN)3]-, and [Co(SCN)4]2-\ndenominator = 1 + beta1 * SCN_conc + beta2 * (SCN_conc)**2 + beta3 * (SCN_conc)**3 + beta4 * (SCN_conc)**4\n\n# Calculate the fraction (alpha_2)\nalpha_2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Calculate the percentage\npercentage = alpha_2 * 100\n\nprint(f\"Percentage of [Co(SCN)2]: {percentage}\")\n```\n>>>\nPercentage of [Co(SCN)2]: 16.916180326482278\n<<<\nThe calculation shows that the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is approximately 16.9%.

    "This is a classic chemical equilibrium problem involving complex formation. To solve it, we need to calculate the mole fraction of the `[Co(SCN)2]` species relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the species in solution:** The solution contains free cobalt ions (`Co^2+`) and a series of complexes formed with thiocyanate (`SCN-`):\n    *   `Co^2+` (free ion)\n    *   `[Co(SCN)]^+`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)2]` (the blue complex we are interested in)\n    *   `[Co(SCN)3]^-`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)4]^2-`\n\n2.  **Define the total cobalt concentration `c(Co)`:**\n    The total concentration of cobalt is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [[Co(SCN)]^+] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]^-] + [[Co(SCN)4]^2-]`\n\n3.  **Use the stability constants (β) to relate the concentrations:**\n    The stability constants relate the concentration of each complex to the concentration of the free metal ion (`[Co^2+]`) and the free ligand (`[SCN-]`).\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)]^+] = β₁ * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)2]] = β₂ * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)3]^-] = β₃ * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)4]^2-] = β₄ * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4`\n\n4.  **Calculate the mole fraction (α₂) of the desired complex:**\n    The percentage we want is the concentration of `[Co(SCN)2]` divided by the total cobalt concentration `c(Co)`, multiplied by 100. This is the mole fraction, α₂, times 100.\n\n    `α₂ = [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)`\n\n    We can substitute the expressions from steps 2 and 3 into this equation:\n\n    `α₂ = (β₂ * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2) / ([Co^2+] + β₁[Co^2+][SCN-] + β₂[Co^2+][SCN-]^2 + β₃[Co^2+][SCN-]^3 + β₄[Co^2+][SCN-]^4)`\n\n    Notice that `[Co^2+]` is a common factor in every term and can be canceled out:\n\n    `α₂ = (β₂ * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + β₁[SCN-] + β₂[SCN-]^2 + β₃[SCN-]^3 + β₄[SCN-]^4)`\n\n5.  **Plug in the given values and solve:**\n    *   `[SCN-] = 0.1 M`\n    *   `β₁ = 9`\n    *   `β₂ = 40`\n    *   `β₃ = 63`\n    *   `β₄ = 16`\n\n    Let's calculate the terms in the denominator first:\n    *   Term 1 (for `Co^2+`): 1\n    *   Term 2 (for `[Co(SCN)]^+`): `β₁ * [SCN-] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n    *   Term 3 (for `[Co(SCN)2]`): `β₂ * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n    *   Term 4 (for `[Co(SCN)3]^-`): `β₃ * [SCN-]^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063`\n    *   Term 5 (for `[Co(SCN)4]^2-`): `β₄ * [SCN-]^4 = 16 * (0.1)^4 = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016`\n\n    The numerator is the term for `[Co(SCN)2]`, which is `0.4`.\n    The denominator is the sum of all terms: `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\n    Now calculate the fraction α₂:\n    `α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n    To get the percentage, multiply by 100:\n    Percentage = `0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%`\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n```python\n# Given values\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nSCN_conc = 0.1\n\n# The numerator is the term corresponding to the [Co(SCN)2] complex\nnumerator = beta2 * (SCN_conc)**2\n\n# The denominator is the sum of terms for all species (from Co^2+ to [Co(SCN)4]^2-)\ndenominator = 1 + (beta1 * SCN_conc) + (beta2 * (SCN_conc)**2) + (beta3 * (SCN_conc)**3) + (beta4 * (SCN_conc)**4)\n\n# Calculate the mole fraction (alpha_2)\nalpha_2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage = alpha_2 * 100\n\nprint(percentage)\n```\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation.\n\n**1.
