    "Here is my thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main goal is to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to Star_2, which is $L_1 / L_2$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Relevant Physics Principles:**\n    *   **Luminosity of a Black Body:** The problem states that we should assume the stars radiate as black bodies. The luminosity ($L$) of a spherical black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:\n        $L = 4 \\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\n        where $R$ is the radius, $T$ is the surface temperature, and $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n    *   **Peak Wavelength of a Black Body:** The wavelength at which a black body appears brightest ($\\lambda_{max}$) is related to its temperature by Wien's Displacement Law:\n        $\\lambda_{max} = b / T$\n        where $b$ is Wien's displacement constant. This law applies to the radiation as it is *emitted* by the star.\n\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** The observed wavelength of light from a moving source is shifted. For a source moving with a radial velocity $v_r$ (positive for moving away, negative for moving towards), the observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) is related to the emitted wavelength ($\\lambda_{emit}$) by:\n        $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{emit} (1 + v_r / c)$\n        where $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n3.  **Set up the Luminosity Ratio:**\n    Using the Stefan-Boltzmann Law for both stars, the ratio of their luminosities is:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (4 \\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4) / (4 \\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4)$\n    The constants ($4\\pi\\sigma$) cancel out, leaving:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (R_1 / R_2)^2 \\times (T_1 / T_2)^4$\n\n4.  **Determine the Radius Ratio ($R_1 / R_2$):**\n    The problem states that \"Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2\".\n    So, $R_1 = 1.5 \\times R_2$, which means the ratio $(R_1 / R_2) = 1.5$.\n\n5.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio ($T_1 / T_2$):**\n    This is the most complex part. The temperature is related to the *emitted* peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{max, emit}$), but the astronomers measure the *observed* peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{max, obs}$). We must account for the Doppler shift caused by the stars' radial velocities.\n\n    *   The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: $\\lambda_{max, obs, 1} = \\lambda_{max, obs, 2}$.\n    *   For Star_1, the radial velocity $v_{r,1} = 0$ km/s. Therefore, there is no Doppler shift.\n        $\\lambda_{max, obs, 1} = \\lambda_{max, emit, 1} (1 + 0/c) = \\lambda_{max, emit, 1}$.\n    *   For Star_2, the radial velocity $v_{r,2} = 700$ km/s. There is a Doppler shift.\n        $\\lambda_{max, obs, 2} = \\lambda_{max, emit, 2} (1 + v_{r,2} / c)$.\n    *   Since the observed wavelengths are equal:\n        $\\lambda_{max, emit, 1} = \\lambda_{max, emit, 2} (1 + v_{r,2} / c)$.\n    *   Now, we relate this back to temperature using Wien's Law ($T = b / \\lambda_{max, emit}$, so $T \\propto 1 / \\lambda_{max, emit}$).\n        $T_1 / T_2 = (\\text{b} / \\lambda_{max, emit, 1}) / (\\text{b} / \\lambda_{max, emit, 2}) = \\lambda_{max, emit, 2} / \\lambda_{max, emit, 1}$.\n    *   Substitute the expression for $\\lambda_{max, emit, 1}$:\n        $T_1 / T_2 = \\lambda_{max, emit, 2} / [\\lambda_{max, emit, 2} (1 + v_{r,2} / c)] = 1 / (1 + v_{r,2} / c)$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Numerical Values:**\n    *   Radius ratio squared: $(R_1 / R_2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25$.\n    *   Temperature ratio: We need the values for $v_{r,2}$ and $c$.\n        $v_{r,2} = 700 \\text{ km/s} = 700 \\times 10^3 \\text{ m/s}$.\n        $c = 3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}$.\n        $T_1 / T_2 = 1 / (1 + (700 \\times 10^3) / (3 \\times 10^8)) = 1 / (1 + 7/3000)$.\n    *   Plug these into the luminosity ratio formula:\n        $L_1 / L_2 = (1.5)^2 \\times [1 / (1 + 7/3000)]^4$.\n\n7.  **Compute the Final Result:**\n    I will use a Python script to compute the final value accurately.\n```python\n# Radial velocity of Star 2 in m/s\nv_r2 = 700 * 1000\n# Speed of light in m/s\nc = 3.0 * 10**8\n\n# The ratio of the radii\nR1_over_R2 = 1.5\n\n# The ratio of the temperatures, accounting for the Doppler effect\n# T1/T2 = lambda_emit_2 / lambda_emit_1 = 1 / (1 + v_r2 / c)\nT1_over_T2 = 1 / (1 + v_r2 / c)\n\n# The ratio of the luminosities\n# L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4\nL1_over_L2 = (R1_over_R2)**2 * (T1_over_T2)**4\n\nprint(L1_over_L2)\n```\n<execute_result>\n2.229150033621763\n</execute_result>\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 2.229.\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated value ~2.229 is closest to option A) ~2.23.\n    (Note: The information about the mass of the stars is not needed for this calculation and is likely a distractor.)\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The user wants to find the ratio of the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2.\n\n**1.

Determine the Radius Ratio ($R_1 / R_2$)**\nThe problem states that \"Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2\".\nSo, $R_1 = 1.5 \\times R_2$.\nThis gives us the ratio: $(R_1 / R_2) = 1.5$.\n\n**4. Determine the Temperature Ratio ($T_1 / T_2$)**\nThis is the trickiest part. The temperature is related to the peak emission wavelength ($\\lambda_{emit}$) by Wien's Displacement Law:\n$T = b / \\lambda_{emit}$ , where $b$ is Wien's constant.\nThis means that the temperature ratio is inversely proportional to the ratio of their *emitted* peak wavelengths:\n$T_1 / T_2 = \\lambda_{emit, 2} / \\lambda_{emit, 1}$\n\nHowever, astronomers measure the *observed* peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$), which is affected by the Doppler shift due to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$).

    "The problem asks for the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to Star_2 ($L_1/L_2$).\n\n**1.

The relationship between observed and emitted wavelength is:\n$\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{emit} (1 + v_r/c)$, where c is the speed of light.\n\nLet's apply this to our stars:\n*   For Star_1: $v_{r,1} = 0$.

Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:\n\nA) ~2.23\nB) ~2.25\nC) ~2.35\nD) ~2.32\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n",
