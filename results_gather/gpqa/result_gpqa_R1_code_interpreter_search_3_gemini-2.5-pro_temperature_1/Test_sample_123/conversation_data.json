    "Here's my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Physics:** The problem involves two key concepts from special relativity and particle physics:\n    *   **Particle Decay:** Unstable particles decay exponentially. The number of particles, N, remaining after a time `t` is given by `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t/T)`, where `N₀` is the initial number of particles and `T` is the mean lifetime of the particles *in the frame where time `t` is measured*.\n    *   **Time Dilation:** The mean lifetime of a moving particle appears longer to a stationary observer (like the detector). If the particle's proper lifetime (its lifetime in its own rest frame) is `τ₀`, and it's moving with a Lorentz factor `γ`, its lifetime as measured in the lab frame will be `T = γτ₀`.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Equation:**\n    *   Let's combine the two concepts. The number of particles remaining after a time `t` (in the lab frame) is:\n        `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / (γτ₀))`\n    *   The particles are created at the center of a spherical detector of radius `R = 30 m`. They travel at an ultra-relativistic velocity, which means their speed `v` is very close to the speed of light, `c`.\n    *   The time it takes for a particle to reach the detector wall is `t_travel = R / v`. Since `v ≈ c`, we can approximate `t_travel ≈ R / c`.\n    *   The fraction `f` of particles that *reach* the detector is the number of particles that haven't decayed by `t_travel`, divided by the initial number `N₀`.\n        `f = N(t_travel) / N₀ = exp(-t_travel / (γτ₀))`\n    *   Substituting `t_travel = R/c`, we get:\n        `f = exp(-(R/c) / (γτ₀))`\n    *   Let's group the constants. The term `R / (cτ₀)` depends on the detector size and the intrinsic properties of the particle, but not on its energy (or Lorentz factor). Let's call this constant `K = R / (cτ₀)`.\n    *   The formula simplifies to:\n        `f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n3.  **Analyze the Two Scenarios:** The problem gives us two scenarios.\n\n    *   **Scenario 1:**\n        *   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`\n        *   Fraction reaching the detector, `f₁ = 1/3`\n\n    *   **Scenario 2:**\n        *   Lorentz factor, `γ₂ = ?`\n        *   Fraction reaching the detector, `f₂ = 2/3`\n\n4.  **Solve for the Unknown Lorentz Factor (`γ₂`):**\n    *   We can use the formula `f = exp(-K / γ)` for both scenarios.\n    *   From Scenario 1: `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n    *   From Scenario 2: `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n    *   To solve this system of equations, let's first isolate the constant `K` using the information from Scenario 1. We can do this by taking the natural logarithm (`ln`) of both sides:\n        `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n        `-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n        `K = 20 * ln(3)`\n    *   Now, we substitute this expression for `K` into the equation for Scenario 2:\n        `2/3 = exp(-(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂)`\n    *   Again, take the natural logarithm of both sides to solve for `γ₂`:\n        `ln(2/3) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n        `-ln(3/2) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n        `ln(1.5) = (20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n    *   Rearrange the equation to solve for `γ₂`:\n        `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(1.5)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Value:** At this point, I have a clear mathematical expression for `γ₂`. I can use a calculator or a simple script to compute the value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Based on the derived formula: gamma2 = 20 * ln(3) / ln(1.5)\ngamma2 = 20 * math.log(3) / math.log(1.5)\nprint(gamma2)\n```\n<execute_result>\n54.1895848386183\n</execute_result>\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated value is approximately 54.19.

    "The problem describes the decay of relativistic particles. The fraction of particles that survive after a certain time is governed by the principles of special relativity (time dilation) and radioactive decay.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Particle Decay Law:** The number of particles `N` remaining after a time `t` from an initial population `N₀` is given by the exponential decay formula:\n    `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / T)`\n    where `T` is the mean lifetime of the particles in the frame of reference where time `t` is measured (in this case, the lab frame).\n\n2.  **Time Dilation:** The lifetime `T` of a particle moving with a Lorentz factor `γ` as measured in the lab frame is dilated compared to its proper lifetime `τ₀` (its lifetime in its own rest frame). The relationship is:\n    `T = γ * τ₀`\n\n3.  **Combining Equations:** By substituting the time-dilated lifetime into the decay law, we get the decay equation in terms of the proper lifetime:\n    `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / (γ * τ₀))`\n\n4.  **Time of Flight:** The particles are produced at the center of a spherical detector with a radius `R = 30 m`. They travel at ultra-relativistic velocities, meaning their speed `v` is very close to the speed of light `c`. The time it takes for them to reach the detector wall in the lab frame is:\n    `t_flight = R / v ≈ R / c`\n\n5.  **Fraction of Surviving Particles:** The fraction `f` of particles that reach the detector is the ratio of the number of particles that haven't decayed by `t_flight` to the initial number `N₀`:\n    `f = N(t_flight) / N₀ = exp(-t_flight / (γ * τ₀))`\n    Substituting `t_flight = R/c`, we get:\n    `f = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ₀))`\n\n6.  **Applying the Scenarios:** We are given two scenarios. The term `R / (c * τ₀)` is a constant for a given particle and detector setup. Let's call this constant `K`. The formula simplifies to `f = exp(-K / γ)`.\n\n    *   **Scenario 1:** `γ₁ = 20` and `f₁ = 1/3`.\n        `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n\n    *   **Scenario 2:** We need to find `γ₂` for `f₂ = 2/3`.\n        `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n\n7.  **Solving for γ₂:** We can solve this system of equations.
