    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe objective is to find the order of magnitude of the entropy (S) of a supermassive black hole, given its distance (d) and the angular size (θ) of its event horizon.\n\n**2. Identify the Key Formula:**\nThe entropy of a black hole is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula:\nS = (k_B * A) / (4 * L_P^2)\nwhere:\n*   S is the entropy.\n*   k_B is the Boltzmann constant (1.38 x 10^-23 J/K).\n*   A is the area of the event horizon.\n*   L_P is the Planck length, L_P = sqrt(G * ħ / c^3).\n\nSubstituting L_P^2 = (G * ħ / c^3) into the entropy formula gives a more direct form:\nS = (k_B * A * c^3) / (4 * G * ħ)\n\nFor a spherical, non-rotating (Schwarzschild) black hole, the event horizon is a sphere with radius R_s (the Schwarzschild radius). Its area A is:\nA = 4 * π * R_s^2\n\nSubstituting this into the entropy formula, we get:\nS = (k_B * (4 * π * R_s^2) * c^3) / (4 * G * ħ)\nS = (k_B * π * c^3 * R_s^2) / (G * ħ)\n\n**3. Determine the Schwarzschild Radius (R_s):**\nWe are not given R_s directly, but we can calculate it from the distance (d) and the angular size (θ). The angular size is the angle subtended by the diameter of the event horizon (2 * R_s).\n\nFor small angles, the relationship between angular size (in radians), physical size (diameter), and distance is:\nθ_rad ≈ (diameter) / distance\nθ_rad ≈ (2 * R_s) / d\n\nFrom this, we can solve for R_s:\nR_s = (d * θ_rad) / 2\n\n**4. Convert Given Values to SI Units:**\nThe formulas require all values to be in standard SI units.\n\n*   **Distance (d):**\n    d = 10^10 parsecs\n    1 parsec ≈ 3.086 × 10^16 meters\n    d = 10^10 * (3.086 × 10^16 m) = 3.086 × 10^26 m\n\n*   **Angular size (θ):**\n    θ = 10^-17 degrees\n    We must convert this to radians since the small-angle formula requires it.\n    1 degree = π / 180 radians\n    θ_rad = 10^-17 * (π / 180) radians ≈ 1.745 × 10^-19 radians\n\n**5. Calculate R_s:**\nNow, plug the SI values into the formula for R_s:\nR_s = ( (3.086 × 10^26 m) * (1.745 × 10^-19) ) / 2\nR_s ≈ (5.385 × 10^7 m) / 2\nR_s ≈ 2.693 × 10^7 m\n\n**6.

Find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the blackhole.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the solution.\n\n**1. Understand the Relationship between Observables and Physical Properties**\nWe are given the angular size (θ) and the distance (d) to the black hole. We need to find its entropy (S). The key is to first relate the given observational data to a physical property of the black hole, namely its size (radius).\n\nFor small angles, the relationship between the physical diameter (D) of an object, its distance (d), and its angular size in radians (θ_rad) is given by:\n`θ_rad ≈ D / d`\n\nThe diameter of the black hole's event horizon is twice its Schwarzschild radius (R_s), so `D = 2 * R_s`.\nTherefore, `θ_rad = (2 * R_s) / d`.\nFrom this, we can express the Schwarzschild radius in terms of the given quantities:\n`R_s = (d * θ_rad) / 2`\n\n**2.

For a sphere, `A = 4 * π * R_s^2`.\n*   `L_P` is the Planck length, defined as `L_P = sqrt(G * ħ / c^3)`.\n\nSubstituting the expressions for `A` and `L_P^2` into the entropy formula gives:\n`S = (k_B * (4 * π * R_s^2) * c^3) / (4 * G * ħ)`\nSimplifying this, we get:\n`S = (k_B * π * c^3 * R_s^2) / (G * ħ)`\n\n**3.
