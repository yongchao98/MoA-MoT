    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the IR spectrum to identify functional groups in Compound X.**\n    *   The broad absorption from 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid, broadened by hydrogen bonding.\n    *   The strong absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch. The position is consistent with a carboxylic acid conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   The absorptions at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ are characteristic of C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR spectrum to determine the structure of Compound X.**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This very downfield, broad singlet signal is definitive for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, indicate a *para*-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is due to the protons *ortho* to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm is due to the protons *ortho* to the other substituent.\n    *   **Alkyl group signals (2.9 ppm, 1.7 ppm, 1.4 ppm, 0.9 ppm):** We need to piece together the structure of the second substituent on the ring.\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This gives a -CH₂CH₃ fragment (an ethyl group).\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methine group (-CH-).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons corresponds to the -CH₂- group of the ethyl fragment. It is a multiplet because it is coupled to both the methyl group (at 0.9 ppm) and the methine group (at 2.9 ppm).\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton corresponds to the -CH- group. Its downfield shift indicates it is the benzylic proton (directly attached to the aromatic ring). It is a multiplet because it is coupled to the adjacent methyl group (at 1.4 ppm) and the adjacent methylene group (at 1.7 ppm).\n        *   Assembling these pieces: The benzylic carbon is a CH, which is bonded to a -CH₃ group and a -CH₂CH₃ group. This entire group is a **sec-butyl group**: -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃).\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the full structure of Compound X.**\n    *   Based on the analysis, Compound X is a *para*-substituted benzoic acid with a *sec*-butyl group. The structure is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches option A.\n\n*   **Step 4: Identify the reaction and predict the product.**\n    *   The reaction is with red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    *   This combination of reagents is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   The aromatic ring and the alkyl (sec-butyl) group are stable under these conditions and will not react.\n    *   Therefore, the -COOH group of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid will be reduced to a -CH₃ group.\n    *   The final product will be **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Step 5: Compare the predicted product with the given options.**\n    *   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: This is the starting material, Compound X.\n    *   B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: Incorrect structure.\n    *   C) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: This matches our predicted product.\n    *   D) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: Incorrect alkyl group. An isobutyl group has a different structure and would give a different NMR spectrum.\n\nThe final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Decipher the structure of the starting material (Compound X) from the provided spectral data.**\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   The very broad absorption in the range of **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is a hallmark feature of the O-H stretching vibration of a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   The strong, sharp peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. Its position is consistent with a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   The peaks at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** are due to C=C bond stretching within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This extremely downfield and broad singlet signal is definitive for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This confirms the IR data.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each representing two protons, is a classic pattern for a *para*-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The protons at 8.0 ppm are *ortho* to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group, making them more deshielded. The protons at 7.2 ppm are *ortho* to the other substituent.\n    *   **Analysis of the alkyl substituent:** We need to assemble the remaining signals into a single group.\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This is the end of an ethyl fragment (-CH₂CH₃).\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet integrating to 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a single proton (a methine, -CH-).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons corresponds to the methylene group (-CH₂-) of the ethyl fragment. It is coupled to both the methyl group at 0.9 ppm and the methine group at 2.9 ppm, making it a complex multiplet.\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton is the methine group (-CH-). Its downfield shift indicates it is the benzylic proton (directly attached to the aromatic ring). It is coupled to the adjacent methyl group (1.4 ppm) and the adjacent methylene group (1.7 ppm).\n    *   **Assembling the structure:** The benzylic carbon is a methine (-CH-) bonded to the ring. This methine is also attached to a methyl group (-CH₃) and an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). This combined group is a **sec-butyl** group.\n\n*   **Structure of Compound X:** Based on the combined spectral data, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the reaction and predict the final product.**\n\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is carried out with red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This combination of reagents is a powerful reducing agent. It is known for the complete reduction of various functional groups, including carboxylic acids.\n*   **Transformation:** Red P and HI will reduce the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) completely to a methyl group (-CH₃). The aromatic ring and the sec-butyl alkyl chain are inert under these conditions.\n    *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n    *   Reaction: The -COOH group at position 1 is reduced to a -CH₃ group.\n    *   Final Product: The product will be **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n**Step 3: Match the predicted product with the given options.**\n\n*   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material, Compound X.\n*   B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - This is an incorrect structure.\n*   C) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This matches our deduced final product.\n*   D) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - This has an isobutyl group, which is a different isomer from the sec-butyl group identified in the starting material.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>",
