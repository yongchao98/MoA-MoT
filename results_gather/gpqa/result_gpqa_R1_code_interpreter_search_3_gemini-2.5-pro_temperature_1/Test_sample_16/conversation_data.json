    "This problem requires us to calculate the concentration of free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) from the dissociation of a Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n1.  **Understand the Equilibrium:**\n    The formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is given by the reaction:\n    $Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$\n\n    The formation constant ($K_f$) for this reaction is given as:\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n    The question asks for the concentration of free $Ca^{2+}$ ions in a solution that initially contains 0.02 M of the complex, $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$. We need to consider the dissociation of this complex, which is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n    $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Set up an ICE Table:**\n    Let's set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to track the concentrations of the species as the complex dissociates. Let 'x' be the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ formed at equilibrium.\n\n| Species             | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| ------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----------------- |\n| $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$   | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x          |\n| $Ca^{2+}$           | 0           | +x         | x                 |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$         | 0           | +x         | x                 |\n\n    Note: The problem states an \"ideal pH,\" which implies that the pH is high enough (typically > 10.2) so that all free EDTA is in its fully deprotonated form ($EDTA^{4-}$). Therefore, we can use the given formation constant directly without needing to calculate a conditional constant.\n\n3.  **Solve for x:**\n    Now, we substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n    $K_f = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x \\cdot x} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n    Because the formation constant ($K_f$) is extremely large, the equilibrium strongly favors the complexed form. This means the dissociation will be minimal, and 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can make the simplifying approximation:\n    $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\n    The equation becomes:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n    Now, we solve for $x^2$:\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x^2 \\approx 0.4 \\times 10^{-12}$\n\n    Finally, solve for x, which represents the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$:\n    $x = \\sqrt{0.4 \\times 10^{-12}} = \\sqrt{0.4} \\times \\sqrt{10^{-12}}$\n    $x \\approx 0.632 \\times 10^{-6}$ M\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n    The concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n4.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated value matches option D.\n\n    *   A) 1.0x10^-2 M\n    *   B) 5.0x10^-3 M\n    *   C) 2.0x10^-2 M\n    *   D) 6.3x10^-7 M\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{D}$.",
