    "<search>zeros of bessel function J1</search>\n<information>\nThe first few zeros of the Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x), are approximately:\n1. 3.83170597\n2. 7.01558667\n3. 10.17346814\n4. 13.32369194\n5. 16.47063005\nThese values are the non-zero values of x for which J₁(x) = 0. The first zero at x=0 is usually excluded when discussing diffraction minima because it corresponds to the central maximum.\nThe first minimum in the Airy diffraction pattern occurs at an angle θ such that sin(θ) ≈ 1.22λ/D, where D is the diameter of the aperture. Since D=2a, this is sin(θ) ≈ 1.22λ/(2a) = 0.61λ/a. This value comes from the first zero, 3.8317, since 3.8317 / π ≈ 1.22. More precisely, θ₁ = (3.8317 / (2π)) * (λ/a) ≈ 0.6098 λ/a.\n</information>\nThe reasoning process remains the same as in the previous steps. I will re-write it clearly, incorporating the verified values for the Bessel function zeros.\n\n**1. The Limiting Case of the Aperture**\nAn N-sided polygon with a constant apothem 'a' will, as N approaches infinity, become a circle of radius 'a'. The problem, therefore, simplifies to finding the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n**2. Fraunhofer Diffraction and the Airy Pattern**\nWhen monochromatic light passes through a circular aperture, it produces a far-field diffraction pattern known as the Airy pattern. The intensity of this pattern as a function of the angle $\\theta$ from the central axis is given by:\n$I(\\theta) = I_0 \\left[ \\frac{2 J_1(k a \\sin\\theta)}{k a \\sin\\theta} \\right]^2$\nwhere $J_1(x)$ is the Bessel function of the first kind of order one, $k = 2\\pi / \\lambda$ is the wave number, and 'a' is the radius of the aperture.\n\n**3. Location of the Intensity Minima**\nThe intensity minima (dark rings in the pattern) occur at angles where the numerator is zero, which means $J_1(k a \\sin\\theta) = 0$. This happens when the argument of the Bessel function, $x = k a \\sin\\theta$, is equal to a non-zero root of $J_1(x)$. Let's denote these roots as $z_m$, where $m = 1, 2, 3, ...$.\n\nThe condition for the m-th minimum is:\n$k a \\sin\\theta_m = z_m$\n\nUsing the small-angle approximation provided in the problem ($\\sin\\theta \\approx \\theta$), this becomes:\n$k a \\theta_m = z_m$\n\nSubstituting the definition of the wave number, $k = 2\\pi / \\lambda$:\n$\\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda} a \\theta_m = z_m$\n\nWe can solve for the angular position of the m-th minimum, $\\theta_m$:\n$\\theta_m = \\frac{z_m \\lambda}{2\\pi a}$\n\n**4. Calculating the Angular Distance**\nThe problem asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, which is $\\Delta\\theta = \\theta_2 - \\theta_1$.\n\n$\\Delta\\theta = \\theta_2 - \\theta_1 = \\left( \\frac{z_2 \\lambda}{2\\pi a} \\right) - \\left( \\frac{z_1 \\lambda}{2\\pi a} \\right) = \\frac{(z_2 - z_1)\\lambda}{2\\pi a}$\n\nFrom the search results and standard tables, the first two non-zero roots of the Bessel function $J_1(x)$ are:\n*   $z_1 \\approx 3.8317$\n*   $z_2 \\approx 7.0156$\n\nNow, we substitute these values into the equation for $\\Delta\\theta$:\n$\\Delta\\theta = \\frac{(7.0156 - 3.8317)\\lambda}{2\\pi a} = \\frac{3.1839 \\lambda}{2\\pi a}$\n\n**5. Numerical Calculation**\nTo find the final numerical coefficient, we perform the division.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# First two non-zero roots of the Bessel function J1(x)\nz1 = 3.8317\nz2 = 7.0156\n\n# Calculate the coefficient for the angular distance between the first two minima\ncoefficient = (z2 - z1) / (2 * np.pi)\nprint(coefficient)\n```\n<execute_on_code_interpreter>\n</execute_on_code_interpreter>\n<execution_result>\n0.506790751913753\n</execution_result>\nThe calculation gives a coefficient of approximately 0.5068. Therefore, the angular distance is:\n$\\Delta\\theta \\approx 0.5068 \\frac{\\lambda}{a}$\n\nComparing this result to the given options, the value 0.506 $\\lambda / a$ is the closest match.\n\n<<<D>>>",
