In relativistic mechanics, the total energy ($E_{total}$) of a particle with rest mass $m$ and velocity $v$ moving in a potential $U(x)$ is given by the sum of its relativistic energy and its potential energy:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x)$\n    where:\n    *   $m$ is the rest mass of the particle.\n    *   $c$ is the speed of light.\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   $U(x)$ is the potential energy associated with the conservative force.\n\n2.  **Define the Potential Energy**\n    The oscillator obeys Hooke's law, $F = -kx$.
