Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Step 1: Find the eigenvalues of the operator P.**\nWe need to solve the characteristic equation `det(P - λI) = 0`, where `I` is the identity matrix and `λ` represents the eigenvalues.\nThe matrix `P - λI` is:\n```\n[ -λ    1/√2    0   ]\n[ 1/√2   -λ    1/√2 ]\n[  0    1/√2   -λ   ]\n```\nThe determinant is:\n`det(P - λI) = -λ((-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2)) - (1/√2)((1/√2)(-λ) - 0)`\n`= -λ(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)(-λ/√2)`\n`= -λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2`\n`= -λ³ + λ`\n`= -λ(λ² - 1)`\n`= -λ(λ - 1)(λ + 1)`\n\nSetting the determinant to zero, `-λ(λ - 1)(λ + 1) = 0`, gives the eigenvalues: `λ = 0`, `λ = 1`, and `λ = -1`.\n\n**Step 2: Find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue of interest (`λ = 0`).**\nThe question asks for the probability of measuring the outcome 0. So, we need the eigenvector `|v₀⟩` corresponding to the eigenvalue `λ = 0`. We find this by solving the equation `P|v₀⟩ = 0|v₀⟩`, which simplifies to `P|v₀⟩ = 0`.\nLet the eigenvector `|v₀⟩` be `[x, y, z]`.\n```\n[ 0    1/√2    0   ] [x]   [0]\n[ 1/√2   0    1/√2 ] [y] = [0]\n[ 0    1/√2    0   ] [z]   [0]\n```\nThis gives us a system of linear equations:\n1.  `(1/√2)y = 0`  => `y = 0`\n2.  `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0` => `x + z = 0` => `x = -z`\n3.  `(1/√2)y = 0` (this is redundant)\n\nFrom these equations, we know the eigenvector must be of the form `[x, 0, -x]`. We can choose a simple non-zero value for `x`, for instance, `x = 1`.\nSo, an unnormalized eigenvector for `λ = 0` is `|v₀⟩ = [1, 0, -1]`.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the necessary components for the probability formula.**\n*   The state vector is `|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]`.\n*   The eigenvector for `λ=0` is `|v₀⟩ = [1, 0, -1]`.\n\nNow, we calculate the inner products:\n*   `⟨v₀|ψ⟩` (dot product of `v₀` and `ψ`):\n    `⟨v₀|ψ⟩ = (1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1) = -1 + 0 - 1 = -2`\n*   `⟨ψ|ψ⟩` (squared norm of `ψ`):\n    `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`\n*   `⟨v₀|v₀⟩` (squared norm of `v₀`):\n    `⟨v₀|v₀⟩ = 1² + 0² + (-1)² = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2`\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final probability.**\nUsing the formula `Prob(λ) = |⟨v_λ|ψ⟩|² / (⟨v_λ|v_λ⟩ * ⟨ψ|ψ⟩)`:\n`Prob(0) = |(-2)|² / (2 * 6)`\n`Prob(0) = 4 / 12`\n`Prob(0) = 1/3`\n\nTo confirm the calculation, let's use a Python script.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the state vector and the operator matrix\npsi = np.array([-1, 2, 1])\nP = np.array([[0, 1/np.sqrt(2), 0],\n              [1/np.sqrt(2), 0, 1/np.sqrt(2)],\n              [0, 1/np.sqrt(2), 0]])\n\n# Find eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P\neigenvalues, eigenvectors = np.linalg.eig(P)\n\n# The eigenvalue we are interested in is 0.

Calculate the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time t.\n\nA) 1/3\nB) 1\nC) \\sqrt{2/3}\nD) 2/3\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n",
