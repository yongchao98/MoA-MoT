Analyze the Gas Separation Process**\n\nThe mixture of gases produced by heating salts A and B is passed through a series of tubes to identify its components.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The weight increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 2(1.008) + 16.00 = 18.016 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.016 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂, SO₂, etc. Since the weight did not change, no such acidic gases were formed during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The weight increase of 0.80 g is due to the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.00 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Since oxygen gas is diatomic (O₂), the moles of O₂ gas are half the moles of O atoms.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** The gas that remains after passing through all three tubes is measured to be 2.24 L at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas did not react with a dehydrating agent, an alkaline solution, or hot copper. This suggests it is a relatively inert gas, with nitrogen (N₂) being the most likely candidate from the decomposition of nitrogen-containing salts. We will assume Gas C is N₂.\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Mixture**\n\nBased on the products, we can determine the total amount of each element in the initial 7.20 g mixture of salts A and B.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** Assuming Gas C is N₂, all nitrogen is in the 0.10 mol of N₂.\n    *   Moles of N = 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in both H₂O and O₂.\n    *   Moles of O = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O in O₂) = (1 × 0.20 mol) + (2 × 0.025 mol) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n\nLet's check if the masses of these elements sum to the initial mass of the mixture.\n*   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.008 g/mol ≈ 0.40 g\n*   Mass of N = 0.20 mol × 14.007 g/mol ≈ 2.80 g\n*   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.00 g/mol = 4.00 g\n*   Total mass = 0.40 + 2.80 + 4.00 = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass, confirming that salts A and B are composed solely of nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nWe are given that the mixture is equimolar. Let 'n' be the number of moles of salt A and 'n' be the number of moles of salt B.\n\nThe total elemental composition from 2n moles of the mixture is 0.40 mol H, 0.20 mol N, and 0.25 mol O.\nTherefore, the elemental ratio for the combined formula of (A + B) is:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\nTo get the simplest integer ratio, we can multiply by 20:\nN : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5\n\nSo, the combined chemical formula for one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nWe need to find two common nitrogen-hydrogen-oxygen salts that sum to this formula. The most common ions are ammonium (NH₄⁺), nitrate (NO₃⁻), and nitrite (NO₂⁻).\nLet's try to combine them:\n*   Salt A: Ammonium Nitrate, **NH₄NO₃** (Formula: N₂H₄O₃)\n*   Salt B: Ammonium Nitrite, **NH₄NO₂** (Formula: N₂H₄O₂)\n\nLet's check if their formulas sum to N₄H₈O₅:\n(N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = N(₂₊₂)H(₄₊₄)O(₃₊₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**.\nThis is a perfect match. So, salts A and B are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n**4. Verify with Reaction Stoichiometry**\n\nLet's verify if the decomposition of an equimolar mixture of these salts produces the observed amounts of gases.\nFirst, find the value of 'n' (moles of each salt).\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.04 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.04 g/mol.\n*   Total mass = n × (M_A + M_B) = n × (80.04 + 64.04) = n × 144.08 g/mol.\n*   7.20 g = n × 144.08 g/mol  =>  n = 7.20 / 144.08 ≈ 0.05 mol.\n\nSo, the mixture contains 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂.\n\n*   **Decomposition of NH₄NO₂:** NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n    *   0.05 mol NH₄NO₂ produces 0.05 mol N₂ and 2 × 0.05 = 0.10 mol H₂O.\n*   **Decomposition of NH₄NO₃:** The decomposition products (N₂, O₂, H₂O) suggest the reaction: 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O.\n    *   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃, the products are:\n        *   N₂: 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃ × (2 mol N₂ / 2 mol NH₄NO₃) = 0.05 mol N₂.\n        *   O₂: 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃ × (1 mol O₂ / 2 mol NH₄NO₃) = 0.025 mol O₂.\n        *   H₂O: 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃ × (4 mol H₂O / 2 mol NH₄NO₃) = 0.10 mol H₂O.\n\n*   **Total products from the mixture:**\n    *   Total N₂ = 0.05 mol (from A) + 0.05 mol (from B) = **0.10 mol** (Matches experimental value).\n    *   Total O₂ = **0.025 mol** (from A only) (Matches experimental value).\n    *   Total H₂O = 0.10 mol (from A) + 0.10 mol (from B) = **0.20 mol** (Matches experimental value).\n\nThe identification of the salts is confirmed.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (i.e., in one formula unit of each).\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 3(O) = 2 N + 4 H + 3 O = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 1(N) + 4(H) + 1(N) + 2(O) = 2 N + 4 H + 2 O = **8 atoms**.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nThe total number of atoms in salts A and B is 17. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the experimental data to identify the gaseous products.**\n    The problem describes heating a mixture of two salts, A and B. The resulting gases are passed through a series of tubes to separate and quantify them.\n\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a powerful dehydrating agent, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass of the tube increased by 3.60 g. This means 3.60 g of H₂O was produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O = 2 * 1.008 + 16.00 ≈ 18.02 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol.\n\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. Since the weight of the tube did not change, no acidic gases were formed in the decomposition.\n\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form solid copper(II) oxide (CuO). The reaction is 2Cu(s) + O₂(g) → 2CuO(s). The mass increase of the tube is due to the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted. The mass increased by 0.80 g.\n        *   This mass increase is the mass of oxygen (O).\n        *   Molar mass of O = 16.00 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n        *   Since oxygen gas is diatomic (O₂), the moles of O₂ gas are half the moles of O atoms.\n        *   Moles of O₂ gas = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n\n    *   **Remaining Gas C:** The gas that did not react in any of the tubes has a volume of 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n        *   At STP, one mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n        *   This gas is inert to a drying agent, a basic solution, and hot copper. This strongly suggests the gas is nitrogen (N₂), a common decomposition product of nitrogen-containing salts.\n\n2.  **Determine the elemental composition of the original salt mixture.**\n    The decomposition produced H₂O, O₂, and N₂. This means the original salts A and B must be composed of Hydrogen (H), Nitrogen (N), and Oxygen (O). Let's calculate the total moles of each element in the initial 7.20 g mixture.\n\n    *   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All H atoms are in the 0.20 mol of H₂O. Each H₂O molecule has 2 H atoms.\n        *   Total moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n    *   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All N atoms are in the 0.10 mol of N₂. Each N₂ molecule has 2 N atoms.\n        *   Total moles of N = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n    *   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen atoms are in both H₂O and O₂.\n        *   Total moles of O = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O in O₂)\n        *   Total moles of O = (1 × 0.20 mol) + (2 × 0.025 mol) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n\n    *   **Mass verification:** Let's check if the mass of these elements adds up to the initial mass of the mixture (7.20 g).\n        *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.4 g.\n        *   Mass of N = 0.20 mol × 14.0 g/mol = 2.8 g.\n        *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.0 g.\n        *   Total mass = 0.4 g + 2.8 g + 4.0 g = 7.20 g. This matches the given initial mass, confirming our analysis.\n\n3.  **Identify Salts A and B.**\n    The problem states we have an \"equimolar mixture\" of salts A and B. This means moles of A = moles of B. The combined empirical formula of one unit of A and one unit of B must have the elemental ratio we just calculated.\n    *   Ratio of moles: N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n    *   To find the simplest integer ratio, we can multiply all numbers by 20:\n        *   N: 0.20 × 20 = 4\n        *   H: 0.40 × 20 = 8\n        *   O: 0.25 × 20 = 5\n    *   So, the combined formula for (Salt A + Salt B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\n    We need to find two common salts composed of N, H, and O that add up to this formula. The most common ions are ammonium (NH₄⁺), nitrate (NO₃⁻), and nitrite (NO₂⁻). Let's try to form salts from these ions.\n    *   Candidate Salt 1: Ammonium Nitrate, **NH₄NO₃**. Formula: N₂H₄O₃.\n    *   Candidate Salt 2: Ammonium Nitrite, **NH₄NO₂**. Formula: N₂H₄O₂.\n\n    Let's check if their formulas sum to N₄H₈O₅:\n    (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = N(₂₊₂)H(₄₊₄)O(₃₊₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**.\n    This is a perfect match. Therefore, salts A and B are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n4.  **Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n    The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n    *   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 3 Oxygen atoms.\n        *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n    *   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 2 Oxygen atoms.\n        *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\n    *   **Total number of atoms in both salts = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B)**\n        *   Total atoms = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",

This implies that the original salts A and B must be composed of Hydrogen (H), Nitrogen (N), and Oxygen (O). We can now calculate the total moles of each element present in the initial 7.20 g mixture.\n\n    *   **Total moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen atoms from the salts are now in the 0.20 mol of H₂O. Since each H₂O molecule contains 2 H atoms:\n        *   Total moles of H = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n    *   **Total moles of Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen atoms are in the 0.10 mol of N₂.

This matches the given initial mass, confirming our analysis.\n\n3.  **Identify Salts A and B.**\n    The problem states we have an \"equimolar mixture\" of salts A and B. This means that if we take one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B, their combined elemental composition must have the molar ratio we just calculated.\n    *   Molar ratio of elements in (A + B): N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n    *   To convert this to the simplest integer ratio, we can multiply all numbers by 20:\n        *   N: 0.20 × 20 = 4\n        *   H: 0.40 × 20 = 8\n        *   O: 0.25 × 20 = 5\n    *   Therefore, the combined chemical formula for one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\n    Now, we need to find two common salts composed of N, H, and O that, when added together, give this formula. The most common ions are ammonium (NH₄⁺), nitrate (NO₃⁻), and nitrite (NO₂⁻). Let's try combining them:\n    *   Let Salt A be Ammonium Nitrate, **NH₄NO₃**.

Each N₂ molecule has 2 N atoms.\n    *   Total moles of N = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen atoms are present in both H₂O and O₂.\n    *   Total moles of O = (moles of O from H₂O) + (moles of O from O₂)\n    *   Total moles of O = (1 × 0.20 mol) + (2 × 0.025 mol) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n\nLet's verify the total mass: Mass = (0.40 mol H × 1.0 g/mol) + (0.20 mol N × 14.0 g/mol) + (0.25 mol O × 16.0 g/mol) = 0.4 g + 2.8 g + 4.0 g = 7.20 g. This matches the initial mass.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the mixture is \"equimolar\". This means the mixture contains equal moles of salt A and salt B. Therefore, the combined chemical formula of one unit of A and one unit of B must have the elemental ratio we just found.\n\n*   Elemental ratio in (A+B): N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n*   To get the simplest whole number ratio, we can multiply all values by 20:\n    *   N: 0.20 × 20 = 4\n    *   H: 0.40 × 20 = 8\n    *   O: 0.25 × 20 = 5\n*   The combined formula of (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nWe need to find two common N-H-O salts whose formulas sum to N₄H₈O₅. The most likely candidates are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n*   Salt A: Ammonium Nitrate, **NH₄NO₃** (Formula: N₂H₄O₃)\n*   Salt B: Ammonium Nitrite, **NH₄NO₂** (Formula: N₂H₄O₂)\n\nLet's sum their formulas: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = N(₂₊₂)H(₄₊₄)O(₃₊₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**.\nThis is a perfect match. The salts are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite. The decomposition reactions that yield the observed products are:\nNH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (i.e., in one formula unit of each).\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**\n\n*   **Total atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nThis result corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "An equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated to 200°C without air. In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (№1), Ca(OH)2 (№2) solution, and red-hot copper (№3). Results: the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube №3). The weight of the second tube has not changed. As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.\n\nA) 19\nB) 17\nC) 13\nD) 15\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the experimental data to identify the gaseous products and their quantities.**\n    The problem describes the heating of a mixture of two salts, A and B, and the subsequent analysis of the gaseous products.\n\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass of the tube increased by 3.60 g. This means 3.60 g of H₂O was produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂. Since the weight of the tube did not change, no acidic gases were formed in the decomposition.\n\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form solid copper(II) oxide (CuO), via the reaction 2Cu(s) + O₂(g) → 2CuO(s). The mass increase of the tube is due to the mass of the oxygen that reacted. The mass increased by 0.80 g.\n        *   This mass increase is the mass of oxygen (O) atoms.\n        *   Molar mass of an oxygen atom (O) = 16.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n        *   Since oxygen gas exists as diatomic molecules (O₂), the moles of O₂ gas are half the moles of O atoms.\n        *   Moles of O₂ gas = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n\n    *   **Remaining Gas C:** The gas that did not react in any of the tubes has a volume of 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n        *   At STP, one mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n        *   This gas is inert to a drying agent, a basic solution, and hot copper. This chemical behavior strongly suggests the gas is nitrogen (N₂), a common decomposition product of nitrogen-containing salts.\n\n2.  **Determine the elemental composition of the original salt mixture.**\n    The gaseous products were H₂O, O₂, and N₂. This implies that the original salts A and B are composed of Hydrogen (H), Nitrogen (N), and Oxygen (O). We can now calculate the total moles of each element in the initial 7.20 g mixture.\n\n    *   **Total moles of Hydrogen (H):** All H atoms from the salts formed 0.20 mol of H₂O. Since each H₂O molecule contains 2 H atoms:\n        *   Total moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n    *   **Total moles of Nitrogen (N):** All N atoms formed 0.10 mol of N₂. Since each N₂ molecule contains 2 N atoms:\n        *   Total moles of N = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n    *   **Total moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen atoms are found in both the H₂O and O₂ produced.\n        *   Total moles of O = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O in O₂)\n        *   Total moles of O = (1 × 0.20 mol) + (2 × 0.025 mol) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n\n    *   **Mass Verification:** Let's confirm that the mass of these elements adds up to the initial mass of the mixture (7.20 g).\n        *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.4 g.\n        *   Mass of N = 0.20 mol × 14.0 g/mol = 2.8 g.\n        *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.0 g.\n        *   Total mass = 0.4 g + 2.8 g + 4.0 g = 7.20 g. This matches the given initial mass, confirming our analysis.\n\n3.  **Identify Salts A and B.**\n    The problem states we have an \"equimolar mixture\" of salts A and B. This means that if we take one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B, their combined elemental formula must have the molar ratio we just calculated.\n    *   Molar ratio of elements in (A + B): N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n    *   To convert this to the simplest integer ratio, we can multiply all numbers by 20:\n        *   N: 0.20 × 20 = 4\n        *   H: 0.40 × 20 = 8\n        *   O: 0.25 × 20 = 5\n    *   Therefore, the combined chemical formula for one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\n    We need to find two common salts composed of N, H, and O that, when added together, give this formula. The most common ions are ammonium (NH₄⁺), nitrate (NO₃⁻), and nitrite (NO₂⁻). Let's try combining them:\n    *   Let Salt A be Ammonium Nitrate, **NH₄NO₃**. Its chemical formula is N₂H₄O₃.\n    *   Let Salt B be Ammonium Nitrite, **NH₄NO₂**. Its chemical formula is N₂H₄O₂.\n\n    Let's check if their combined formula matches our derived formula:\n    (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = N(₂₊₂)H(₄₊₄)O(₃₊₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**.\n    This is a perfect match. Thus, salts A and B are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n4.  **Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n    The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in one formula unit of NH₄NO₃ and one formula unit of NH₄NO₂.\n\n    *   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = **9 atoms**.\n    *   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = **8 atoms**.\n\n    *   **Total number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B)**\n    *   Total atoms = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
