    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene which is symmetrically substituted with a propyl group on each side of the double bond.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **mCPBA (m-Chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs epoxidation, which is a *syn-addition* of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This reagent causes acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. This reaction proceeds via an Sₙ2-like mechanism, resulting in *anti-addition* of two hydroxyl (-OH) groups across the original double bond.\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The two-step sequence (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis) results in the *anti-dihydroxylation* of the alkene.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** There is a well-established rule for the stereochemical outcome of additions to alkenes:\n    *   *An anti-addition to a trans-alkene results in a meso compound (if the alkene is symmetrically substituted).*\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** Since (E)-oct-4-ene is a symmetric trans-alkene, its anti-dihydroxylation will yield a single product: the meso diol, specifically **meso-octane-4,5-diol**, which has the configuration (4R, 5S). Let's call this compound **M**.\n\n*Detailed Path for Reaction 1 (Optional but confirmatory):*\n1.  (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA → A racemic mixture of trans-epoxides: (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n2.  Ring-opening of (4R,5R)-epoxide with H₃O⁺ gives (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (a meso compound) via anti-attack.\n3.  Ring-opening of (4S,5S)-epoxide with H₃O⁺ also gives (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n4.  Thus, the final product is exclusively the meso-diol.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene, also symmetrically substituted.\n*   **Reagents:** The same as in Reaction 1 (mCPBA, then H₃O⁺).\n*   **Overall Transformation:** This is also an *anti-dihydroxylation*.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** We apply the corresponding stereochemical rule:\n    *   *An anti-addition to a cis-alkene results in a racemic mixture of enantiomers.*\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** Since (Z)-oct-4-ene is a symmetric cis-alkene, its anti-dihydroxylation will yield a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric diols: **(4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. Let's call them **RR** and **SS**, respectively.\n\n*Detailed Path for Reaction 2 (Optional but confirmatory):*\n1.  (Z)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA → A single meso cis-epoxide: (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n2.  Ring-opening of this meso-epoxide with H₃O⁺ involves attack at either C4 or C5.\n3.  Attack at C4 (which is R) gives the (4S,5S)-diol.\n4.  Attack at C5 (which is S) gives the (4R,5R)-diol.\n5.  Since attacks at C4 and C5 are equally probable, a 1:1 mixture of the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers (a racemic mixture) is formed.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three stereoisomers:\n1.  **M:** meso-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **RR:** (4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **SS:** (4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's look at the relationships between these isomers:\n*   **RR** and **SS** are **enantiomers**.\n*   **M** is a **diastereomer** of both **RR** and **SS**.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\nThe product mixture is analyzed using two different HPLC techniques.\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   Achiral columns separate compounds based on properties like polarity, size, and shape, but they cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n    *   Enantiomers (like **RR** and **SS**) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will therefore elute at the same time, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers (like **M** vs. the **RR/SS** pair) have different physical properties and will be separated.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **two peaks**: one for the meso compound (**M**) and one for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair (**RR** + **SS**).\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   Chiral columns have a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The enantiomers **RR** and **SS** will be resolved into two separate peaks.\n    *   The meso compound **M**, being a diastereomer to **RR** and **SS**, will also elute at a distinct time, producing its own peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **three peaks**: one for **M**, one for **RR**, and one for **SS**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts:\n*   **2 peaks** in the standard (achiral) HPLC.\n*   **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the stereochemical outcomes of two reactions and how the resulting products would be resolved by different types of chromatography.\n\n### **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n**1. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. It is also symmetrically substituted, with a propyl group on each side of the double bond.\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is a two-step process.\n    1.  **mCPBA (m-Chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs epoxidation. Epoxidation is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond. For a *trans*-alkene, this produces a *trans*-epoxide. Since the starting material is achiral, the epoxidation will produce a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This reagent causes the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. This proceeds via an Sₙ2-type mechanism where a water molecule attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the back side. This results in an overall *anti*-dihydroxylation of the original alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 1:** There is a well-established rule for the stereochemistry of *anti*-addition to alkenes: *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene yields a *meso* compound (if the substitution pattern allows for a meso form, which it does here).\n    *   Let's verify this. Take the (4R,5R)-epoxide intermediate. Acid-catalyzed attack by water at C4 inverts its stereocenter to S, giving (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol. Attack at C5 inverts its stereocenter to S, giving (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. Note that (4S,5R) and (4R,5S) describe the *same* meso compound.\n    *   Starting with the (4S,5S)-epoxide also yields the same meso product.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single compound, **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**2. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene, which is also symmetrically substituted.\n*   **Reagents:** Same as Reaction 1 (mCPBA, then H₃O⁺), leading to an overall *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 2:** The corresponding stereochemical rule is: *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene yields a *racemic mixture* of enantiomers.\n    *   Let's verify this. Epoxidation (*syn*-addition) of the *cis*-alkene gives a *meso*-epoxide, (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   Acid-catalyzed ring opening (*anti*-attack) of this meso-epoxide can occur at either C4 or C5. Attack at C4 (R-configuration) inverts it to S, yielding **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. Attack at C5 (S-configuration) inverts it to R, yielding **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n    *   These two products, (4R,5R) and (4S,5S), are enantiomers. Since attack at either carbon is equally probable, they are formed in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A **racemic mixture** of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**3. Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe stereochemical relationships are:\n*   (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) compounds.\n\n**4. Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity) but *cannot* distinguish between enantiomers.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, the enantiomeric pair ((4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diol) will co-elute and appear as a **single peak**.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties. The meso-diol will have a different retention time from the enantiomeric pair. It will appear as a **separate peak**.\n    *   **Total Peaks:** 1 (for the enantiomeric pair) + 1 (for the meso compound) = **2 peaks**.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The enantiomers ((4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diol) will be resolved into **two separate peaks**.\n    *   The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also have a unique interaction with the chiral column and will elute as a **third, distinct peak**.\n    *   **Total Peaks:** 1 (for (4R,5R)-diol) + 1 (for (4S,5S)-diol) + 1 (for the meso compound) = **3 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<B>>>",

This is a *trans*-alkene and is symmetrically substituted.\n*   **Reagents:** The process involves two steps:\n    1.  **mCPBA (m-Chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs epoxidation. Epoxidation is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This reagent catalyzes the ring-opening of the epoxide. The water molecule acts as a nucleophile and attacks the epoxide from the side opposite the oxygen bridge (backside attack). This is an *anti*-addition of the two hydroxyl (-OH) groups.\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The combination of epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis results in the *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** A fundamental rule in stereochemistry states that the *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene results in a *meso* compound (provided the alkene is symmetric, which it is).\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** The reaction produces a single product, **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.

This is a *cis*-alkene, also symmetrically substituted.\n*   **Reagents:** The reagents are the same, so the overall transformation is also an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The corresponding rule for a *cis*-alkene is that *anti*-addition results in a *racemic mixture* of enantiomers.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** The reaction produces a 1:1 mixture of two enantiomers: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nAfter both reactions are complete, the chemist combines the products. The final mixture contains three stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's examine the relationship between these molecules:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols (stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the Chromatographic Results**\n\nThe mixture is analyzed by two types of HPLC.\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n    *   Enantiomers (the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will thus have the same retention time. They will elute together as a **single peak**.\n    *   Diastereomers (the meso-diol vs. the enantiomeric pair) have different physical properties and will be separated. The meso-diol will elute at a different time, producing a **second peak**.\n    *   **Conclusion for standard HPLC: 2 peaks.**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, will be resolved and elute as **two separate peaks**.\n    *   The meso-diol, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also interact uniquely with the chiral column and will elute as a **third distinct peak**.\n    *   **Conclusion for chiral HPLC: 3 peaks.**\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe 2 peaks on the standard HPLC column and 3 peaks on the chiral HPLC column.
