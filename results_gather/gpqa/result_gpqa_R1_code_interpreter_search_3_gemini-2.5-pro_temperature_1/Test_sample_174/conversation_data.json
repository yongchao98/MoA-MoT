    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Model:** The problem describes an \"oscillating charge distribution\" that is \"spheroid in shape\" with a symmetry axis along the z-axis. This system is radiating electromagnetic waves. In the context of electromagnetic radiation, any oscillating charge/current distribution can be analyzed using a multipole expansion. The lowest-order term that contributes to radiation is typically the electric dipole, followed by the magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole, and so on. Unless specific constraints are given (like a vanishing dipole moment), the electric dipole term is the dominant source of radiation, especially in the long-wavelength limit (which is implied by being in the \"radiation zone\"). The simplest and most general model for a charge distribution oscillating along a single axis (the z-axis, due to symmetry) is that of an oscillating electric dipole.\n\n2.  **Angular Dependence of Dipole Radiation:** For an electric dipole `p` oscillating along the z-axis, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle, `dP/dΩ`, is given by the formula:\n    `dP/dΩ = C * sin²(θ)`\n    where `θ` is the polar angle measured from the axis of the dipole (the z-axis), and `C` is a constant that depends on the dipole moment amplitude and frequency, but not on the angle `θ`. The function `f` in the problem is this power per unit solid angle, so `f(λ, θ) ∝ sin²(θ)`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Maximum Power:** The radiated power `f` depends on `sin²(θ)`. The maximum value of `sin²(θ)` is 1, which occurs when `θ = 90°` (i.e., in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis). The problem states that this maximum power is `A`.\n    `A = f_max = C * sin²(90°) = C * 1 = C`\n    So, the constant of proportionality `C` is the maximum power `A`. We can now write the power distribution as:\n    `f(λ, θ) = A * sin²(θ)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Power at θ = 30°:** We need to find the fraction of `A` that is radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`. We can calculate this using the formula from the previous step:\n    `f(λ, 30°) = A * sin²(30°)`\n    The value of `sin(30°)` is `1/2`.\n    Therefore, `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n    Substituting this back, we get:\n    `f(λ, 30°) = A * (1/4) = A/4`\n    The *fraction* of `A` radiated at this angle is `(A/4) / A = 1/4`.\n\n5.  **Determine the Wavelength Dependence:** Now we need to find the dependence of the function `f` on the wavelength `λ`. The power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is proportional to the fourth power of its angular frequency `ω`.\n    `P ∝ ω⁴`\n    The angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` and the speed of light `c` by the formula `ω = 2πf = 2πc/λ`.\n    Substituting this relationship into the power proportionality:\n    `P ∝ (2πc/λ)⁴ ∝ 1/λ⁴ = λ⁻⁴`\n    Since the power per unit solid angle `f(λ, θ)` is directly proportional to the total power `P`, it must have the same dependence on wavelength.\n    `f ∝ λ⁻⁴`\n    This is the famous Rayleigh scattering law dependence.\n\n6.  **Combine the Results:**\n    *   The fraction of `A` radiated at `θ = 30°` is `1/4`.\n    *   A possible form for the dependence of `f` on `λ` is `λ⁻⁴`.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** Matching these results with the given options:\n    A) 1/4, λ⁻³\n    B) 1/2, λ⁻⁴\n    C) 1/4, λ⁻⁴\n    D) 3/4, λ⁻⁶\n\n    The correct option is C.\n\n*(Note: One might consider higher-order multipoles like the electric quadrupole. A specific type of quadrupole oscillation would lead to option D. However, the electric dipole is the lowest-order and most general radiation source for an oscillating charge, making the dipole model the most appropriate interpretation of the problem statement.)*\n\n<<<C>>>",

The maximum power occurs when `sin²(θ)` is at its maximum value. The maximum value of `sin²(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°`.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n`A = f_max = C * sin²(90°) = C * 1 = C`\n\nTherefore, the constant `C` is equal to the maximum power `A`.

Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power**\n\nThe total power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency (`ω`) of oscillation.\n\n`P_total ∝ ω⁴`\n\nSince the power per unit solid angle `f(λ, θ)` is directly proportional to the total power, it has the same frequency dependence:\n\n`f ∝ ω⁴`\n\nThe angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` and the speed of light `c` by `ω = 2πc/λ`. Substituting this into the proportionality:\n\n`f ∝ (2πc/λ)⁴ ∝ 1/λ⁴ = λ⁻⁴`\n\nThis `λ⁻⁴` dependence is characteristic of dipole radiation and is also known as the Rayleigh scattering law.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining the two results:\n*   The fraction of maximum power `A` radiated at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n*   A possible form for the dependence of `f` on wavelength `λ` is **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nThese results correspond to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",

    "An oscillating charge distribution along a specific axis (the z-axis in this case) is best modeled as a simple oscillating electric dipole. The radiation properties of such a dipole are well-understood.\n\n**1.
