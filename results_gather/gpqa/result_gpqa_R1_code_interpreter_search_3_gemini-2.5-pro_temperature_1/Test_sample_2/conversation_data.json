    "The user wants to find the expectation value of the operator `10σ_z + 5σ_x` for a spin-half particle in a given state.\n\n1.  **Define the quantum state and the operator:**\n    The state of the spin-half particle is given as a linear superposition:\n    `|ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩`\n\n    The operator is:\n    `O = 10σ_z + 5σ_x`\n\n2.  **Recall the matrix representations:**\n    In the standard basis where `|↑⟩` is represented by the column vector `[1, 0]` and `|↓⟩` is represented by `[0, 1]`, the state vector is:\n    `|ψ⟩ = 0.5 * [1, 0]^T + (√3/2) * [0, 1]^T = [0.5, √3/2]^T`\n\n    The corresponding bra vector, `<ψ|`, is the conjugate transpose of `|ψ⟩`:\n    `<ψ| = [0.5, √3/2]`\n\n    The Pauli matrices are:\n    `σ_z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`\n    `σ_x = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\n\n3.  **Set up the expectation value calculation:**\n    The expectation value of an operator `O` in the state `|ψ⟩` is given by `<O> = <ψ|O|ψ>`.\n    Due to the linearity of the expectation value, we can write:\n    `<O> = <ψ|(10σ_z + 5σ_x)|ψ> = 10<ψ|σ_z|ψ> + 5<ψ|σ_x|ψ>`\n    This simplifies the problem to finding the individual expectation values of `σ_z` and `σ_x`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the expectation value of σ_z:**\n    `<σ_z> = <ψ|σ_z|ψ>`\n    First, apply `σ_z` to `|ψ⟩`:\n    `σ_z|ψ⟩ = [[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [0.5, √3/2]^T = [1*0.5, -1*(√3/2)]^T = [0.5, -√3/2]^T`\n    Now, take the inner product with `<ψ|`:\n    `<σ_z> = [0.5, √3/2] * [0.5, -√3/2]^T = (0.5 * 0.5) + ( (√3/2) * (-√3/2) ) = 0.25 - 3/4 = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5`\n\n5.  **Calculate the expectation value of σ_x:**\n    `<σ_x> = <ψ|σ_x|ψ>`\n    First, apply `σ_x` to `|ψ⟩`:\n    `σ_x|ψ⟩ = [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * [0.5, √3/2]^T = [1*(√3/2), 1*0.5]^T = [√3/2, 0.5]^T`\n    Now, take the inner product with `<ψ|`:\n    `<σ_x> = [0.5, √3/2] * [√3/2, 0.5]^T = (0.5 * √3/2) + ( (√3/2) * 0.5 ) = √3/4 + √3/4 = 2√3/4 = √3/2`\n\n6.  **Combine the results and find the final numerical value:**\n    Now substitute the individual expectation values back into the main expression:\n    `<O> = 10<σ_z> + 5<σ_x> = 10 * (-0.5) + 5 * (√3/2)`\n    `<O> = -5 + 2.5 * √3`\n\n    To get the numerical value, we can use a calculator or a simple script.\n```python\nimport math\n# Calculate the final expectation value\nexpectation_value = -5 + 2.5 * math.sqrt(3)\nprint(expectation_value)\n```\n<execute_result>\n-0.6698729810778066\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated value is approximately -0.66987.

    "The problem asks for the expectation value of the operator `O = 10σ_z + 5σ_x` for a spin-half particle in the state `|ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩`.\n\n**1. Define the state and operator in matrix form:**\n\nIn the standard basis where `|↑⟩ = [1, 0]^T` and `|↓⟩ = [0, 1]^T`, the state vector `|ψ⟩` is:\n`|ψ⟩ = 0.5 * [1, 0]^T + (√3/2) * [0, 1]^T = [0.5, √3/2]^T`\n\nThe corresponding bra vector, `<ψ|`, is the conjugate transpose of `|ψ⟩`.

Formulate the expectation value calculation:**\n\nThe expectation value of the operator `O` is given by `<O> = <ψ|O|ψ>`.\nDue to the linearity of the expectation value, we can write:\n`<O> = <ψ|(10σ_z + 5σ_x)|ψ> = 10<ψ|σ_z|ψ> + 5<ψ|σ_x|ψ>`\nThis is equivalent to `10<σ_z> + 5<σ_x>`, where `<σ_z>` and `<σ_x>` are the expectation values of the individual Pauli matrices.\n\n**3.

Calculate the expectation value of σ_x (`<σ_x>`):**\n\n`<σ_x> = <ψ|σ_x|ψ>`\nFirst, calculate `σ_x|ψ⟩`:\n`σ_x|ψ⟩ = [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * [0.5, √3/2]^T = [√3/2, 0.5]^T`\nThen, calculate the inner product with `<ψ|`:\n`<σ_x> = [0.5, √3/2] * [√3/2, 0.5]^T`\n`<σ_x> = (0.5 * √3/2) + (√3/2 * 0.5) = √3/4 + √3/4 = 2√3/4 = √3/2`\n\n**5.
