    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   The \"Galaxy reference frame\" (let's call it S). This is considered the stationary frame.\n    *   The \"ejecta reference frame\" (let's call it S'). This is the moving frame.\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time elapsed in the moving frame (the ejecta's frame) is `Δt' = 50 s`. This is the proper time, often denoted as `Δt₀`.\n    *   The speed of light, `c`, is approximately `300,000 km/s`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (S). Let's call this distance `d`.\n\n4.  **Apply the Principles of Special Relativity:**\n    *   **Distance in the Galaxy Frame:** The distance `d` is calculated by multiplying the ejecta's velocity `v` by the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame, `Δt`.\n        `d = v * Δt`\n    *   **Time Dilation:** An observer in the stationary frame (Galaxy) will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) compared to the time interval measured in the moving frame (`Δt'`). This phenomenon is called time dilation. The relationship is given by the formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n        where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    *   The Lorentz factor is defined as:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) `\n    *   First, let's calculate the ratio `β = v/c`:\n        `β = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Now, we can calculate `γ`. We can either use the exact formula or a common approximation. Given the context of multiple-choice questions, let's first try the binomial approximation for `γ` when `v` is much smaller than `c` (which `v=0.2c` can be considered for this purpose):\n        `γ = (1 - β²)^(-1/2) ≈ 1 + (1/2)β²`\n        `γ ≈ 1 + (1/2)(0.2)² = 1 + (1/2)(0.04) = 1 + 0.02 = 1.02`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Time in the Galaxy Frame (Δt):**\n    *   Using the approximate value of `γ`:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt' ≈ 1.02 * 50 s = 51 s`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy Frame (d):**\n    *   Now, we can calculate the distance `d`:\n        `d = v * Δt ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51 s = 3,060,000 km`\n\nThis result exactly matches option B.\n\n*Alternative Check (using the exact value of γ):*\nLet's see what the exact calculation gives.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the constants\nv = 60000  # velocity of the ejecta in km/s\ndelta_t0 = 50  # proper time in seconds (in the ejecta's frame)\nc = 300000 # speed of light in km/s\n\n# Calculate beta\nbeta = v / c\n\n# Calculate the exact Lorentz factor gamma\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta**2)\n\n# Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame\ndelta_t = gamma * delta_t0\n\n# Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame\ndistance_in_galaxy_frame = v * delta_t\n\nprint(f\"Calculated distance (km): {distance_in_galaxy_frame}\")\n```\n[execution result]\n```\nCalculated distance (km): 3061862.178478726\n```\nThe exact calculation gives `3,061,862 km`. This value is extremely close to option B (`3,060,000 km`) and much closer to it than to any other option. The fact that the approximation `γ ≈ 1.02` yields the exact answer for option B strongly suggests it was the intended method for this problem.\n\nFinal Answer Reasoning: The distance traveled in the Galaxy frame is given by `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time measured in the Galaxy frame. Due to time dilation, `Δt` is related to the proper time `Δt₀ = 50 s` by `Δt = γ * Δt₀`. Using the common binomial approximation for the Lorentz factor, `γ ≈ 1.02`. Therefore, `d ≈ 60,000 km/s * (1.02 * 50 s) = 3,060,000 km`.\n\n<<<B>>>",

    "This is a classic problem in special relativity involving time dilation. Let's break it down step-by-step.\n\n**1. Understand the Setup**\n\n*   We have two inertial frames of reference: The Galaxy's frame (let's call it S) and the ejecta's frame (let's call it S').\n*   The frame S' (ejecta) is moving relative to frame S (Galaxy) at a very high speed.\n*   The problem asks for a distance measured in the Galaxy's frame (S), based on a time interval measured in the ejecta's frame (S').\n\n**2. Identify the Given Information**\n\n*   **Relative velocity (v):** `60,000 km/s`.\n*   **Time in the moving frame (Δt'):** `50 s`.
