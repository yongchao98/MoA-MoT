    "This problem is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, specifically the energy-time uncertainty relation.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Principle:** The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time states that it is impossible to know both the exact energy of a quantum state and its exact lifetime simultaneously. The relationship is given by:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    where:\n    *   ΔE is the uncertainty in the energy of the state (also known as the natural linewidth).\n    *   Δt is the lifetime of the state (τ).\n    *   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ = h / 2π).\n\n2.  **Interpret the Problem:** We have two energy levels, E1 and E2, with lifetimes τ1 = 10⁻⁹ s and τ2 = 10⁻⁸ s, respectively. Due to their finite lifetimes, each energy level is not a sharp line but is broadened. The uncertainty or \"width\" of each energy level (ΔE) can be estimated using the uncertainty principle, where we can approximate ΔE ≈ ħ / τ.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Energy Uncertainty for Each State:** To resolve or \"clearly distinguish\" the two energy levels, the difference in their energies, |E1 - E2|, must be greater than the energy broadening of the levels. The state with the shorter lifetime will have the larger energy uncertainty, and this will be the limiting factor for resolution.\n\n    *   **State 1:** τ1 = 10⁻⁹ s (shorter lifetime)\n    *   **State 2:** τ2 = 10⁻⁸ s (longer lifetime)\n\n    The state with the shorter lifetime (State 1) will have the larger energy width (ΔE1). This is the dominant uncertainty. Let's calculate it.\n\n    *   ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1\n    *   ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2\n\n    For the levels to be resolvable, the energy difference between them must be at least of the order of the larger energy width, ΔE1. A more formal criterion (the Rayleigh criterion for spectroscopy) states that the separation should be greater than the sum of the half-widths, but comparing to the larger width is sufficient here.\n\n    |E1 - E2| > ΔE1\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:** We need the value of the reduced Planck constant, ħ, in units of electron-volts times seconds (eV·s) to get the energy uncertainty in eV.\n    *   ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n\n    Now, calculate the energy uncertainty for the state with the shorter lifetime (τ1 = 10⁻⁹ s):\n    *   ΔE1 ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s)\n    *   ΔE1 ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    Let's also calculate ΔE2 for completeness:\n    *   ΔE2 ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s)\n    *   ΔE2 ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n    As expected, ΔE1 is larger. Therefore, to clearly distinguish the two energy levels, their energy separation |E1 - E2| must be greater than approximately 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n5.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    *   A) 10⁻⁴ eV\n    *   B) 10⁻⁹ eV\n    *   C) 10⁻⁸ eV\n    *   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV\n\n    We need to find the option that is greater than our calculated minimum separation of ~10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n    *   A) 10⁻⁴ eV is much greater than 10⁻⁷ eV. This is a valid energy difference for resolution.\n    *   B) 10⁻⁹ eV is much less than 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would overlap completely.\n    *   C) 10⁻⁸ eV is less than 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would not be clearly resolved.\n    *   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV is much less than 10⁻⁷ eV. The levels would overlap completely.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The only energy difference large enough to ensure the two energy levels can be clearly resolved is 10⁻⁴ eV.\n\nTo be more precise, let's use a calculator.\n```python\n# Constants\nh_bar_eV_s = 6.582119569e-16  # Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\n\n# Lifetimes\ntau1 = 1e-9  # seconds\ntau2 = 1e-8  # seconds\n\n# Calculate energy uncertainties (linewidths)\ndelta_E1 = h_bar_eV_s / tau1\ndelta_E2 = h_bar_eV_s / tau2\n\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty for state 1 (ΔE1): {delta_E1:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty for state 2 (ΔE2): {delta_E2:.3e} eV\")\n\n# The required energy separation must be larger than the dominant (larger) uncertainty.\nrequired_separation = delta_E1\nprint(f\"To be resolvable, the energy difference must be greater than ~{required_separation:.3e} eV.\")\n\n# Check the options\noptions = {\n    \"A\": 1e-4,\n    \"B\": 1e-9,\n    \"C\": 1e-8,\n    \"D\": 1e-11\n}\n\nprint(\"\\nComparing with options:\")\nfor option, value in options.items():\n    if value > required_separation:\n        print(f\"Option {option} ({value:.1e} eV) is a possible energy difference.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Option {option} ({value:.1e} eV) is NOT a possible energy difference.\")\n```\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Governing Principle:** The problem relates the lifetime of a quantum state to its energy. This is a direct application of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, specifically the energy-time uncertainty relation.\n\n2.  **State the Uncertainty Principle:** The energy-time uncertainty principle is given by the formula:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    where:\n    *   ΔE is the uncertainty in the energy of the state. This can be interpreted as the natural linewidth or energy broadening of the state.\n    *   Δt is the lifetime of the state (often denoted by τ).\n    *   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ = h / 2π).\n\n3.  **Apply the Principle to the Problem:** For a quantum state with a finite lifetime τ, its energy is not perfectly defined. There is an inherent uncertainty or \"spread\" in its energy, ΔE. We can approximate this minimum uncertainty as:\n    ΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy Uncertainty for Each State:** We are given two states with different lifetimes:\n    *   State 1: Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   State 2: Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n\n    The energy uncertainty (linewidth) for each state is:\n    *   ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁\n    *   ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂\n\n    Notice that the state with the *shorter* lifetime (State 1) will have the *larger* energy uncertainty. This larger uncertainty is the primary factor that limits our ability to distinguish between the two energy levels.\n\n5.  **Determine the Condition for Resolution:** To \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the difference in their energies, |E₂ - E₁|, must be greater than their energy uncertainties. A common criterion is that the separation should be at least as large as the broader of the two linewidths. In this case, the broader linewidth is ΔE₁.\n    Therefore, the condition for resolution is:\n    |E₂ - E₁| > ΔE₁\n\n6.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   First, we need the value of the reduced Planck constant in units that are convenient for this problem, which is electron-volts-seconds (eV·s).\n        ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n    *   Now, calculate the larger energy uncertainty, ΔE₁, corresponding to the shorter lifetime, τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s:\n        ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s)\n        ΔE₁ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    (For completeness, let's also calculate ΔE₂:\n    ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV. As expected, ΔE₁ > ΔE₂.)\n\n7.  **Compare with the Given Options:** The energy difference |E₂ - E₁| must be greater than ~6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV for the levels to be clearly resolved. Let's check the options:\n    *   A) 10⁻⁴ eV: This value is much greater than 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV. (10⁻⁴ = 1000 × 10⁻⁷)\n    *   B) 10⁻⁹ eV: This value is much smaller than 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   C) 10⁻⁸ eV: This value is smaller than 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV. (10⁻⁸ ≈ 0.15 × (6.6 × 10⁻⁷))\n    *   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV: This value is much smaller than 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** If the energy difference were 10⁻⁸ eV or smaller, the energy levels would be so broadened (especially the one with the 10⁻⁹ s lifetime) that they would significantly overlap, making them impossible to distinguish. Only an energy difference of 10⁻⁴ eV is large enough to be clearly resolved.\n\n<<<A>>>",

Since both levels have a width, a conservative criterion is that the separation must be larger than the broader of the two widths.\n\n4.  **Calculate the energy widths (ΔE).** The energy width (uncertainty) is inversely proportional to the lifetime: ΔE ≈ ħ / τ.\n    *   We have two lifetimes: τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s and τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s.\n    *   The state with the *shorter* lifetime (τ₁) will have the *larger* energy width (ΔE₁).
