The relationship is $\\Gamma \\tau \\approx \\hbar$, which gives $\\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$. Here, $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n3.  **Combine the Formulas:**\n    We start with the formula for the decay distance:\n    $L = v \\cdot \\tau'$\n    Substitute $\\tau' = \\gamma \\tau$:\n    $L = v \\cdot \\gamma \\tau = \\gamma v \\tau$\n    It's standard to express velocity as a fraction of the speed of light, $v = \\beta c$.\n    $L = \\gamma \\beta c \\tau$\n    Now substitute $\\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$:\n    $L = \\gamma \\beta c \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$\n    For convenience in particle physics, we group $\\hbar$ and $c$ together, as the value of $\\hbar c$ is well-known. The final working formula is:\n    $L = (\\gamma \\beta) \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma}$\n\n4.  **Extract Given Values and Constants:**\n    *   Total energy of the particle: $E_{X}=8 \\, \\text{GeV} = 8000 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n    *   Rest mass of the particle: $m_{X}=1.2 \\, \\text{GeV}$, which means its rest mass energy is $m_{X}c^2=1.2 \\, \\text{GeV} = 1200 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n    *   Decay width: $\\Gamma_{X}=320 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n    *   Physical constant: $\\hbar c \\approx 197.327 \\, \\text{MeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}$ (where $1 \\, \\text{fm} = 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}$).\n\n5.  **Calculate the Relativistic Factor $\\gamma\\beta$:**\n    The term $\\gamma\\beta$ can be determined from the particle's energy and momentum.\n    The relativistic total energy is $E = \\gamma m c^2$.\n    The relativistic momentum is $p = \\gamma m v = \\gamma m \\beta c$.\n    The energy-momentum relation is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$.\n    From the momentum equation, we can see that $pc = (\\gamma \\beta) (mc^2)$.\n    Therefore, we can find $\\gamma\\beta$ by calculating $pc$ and dividing by $mc^2$.\n\n    First, calculate $pc$ from the energy-momentum relation:\n    $(pc)^2 = E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2$\n    $(pc)^2 = (8000 \\, \\text{MeV})^2 - (1200 \\, \\text{MeV})^2$\n    $(pc)^2 = 64,000,000 \\, \\text{MeV}^2 - 1,440,000 \\, \\text{MeV}^2 = 62,560,000 \\, \\text{MeV}^2$\n    $pc = \\sqrt{62,560,000} \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\n    Now, calculate $\\gamma\\beta$:\n    $\\gamma\\beta = \\frac{pc}{m_X c^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{62,560,000} \\, \\text{MeV}}{1200 \\, \\text{MeV}}$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Distance ($L$):**\n    Now substitute all the calculated and given values into our working formula:\n    $L = \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{62,560,000}}{1200} \\right) \\cdot \\frac{197.327 \\, \\text{MeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}}{320 \\, \\text{MeV}}$\n\n    To get the final numerical value, we use a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nhbar_c = 197.327  # in MeV fm\n\n# Given values converted to MeV\nE_X = 8000.0      # in MeV\nm_X_c2 = 1200.0   # in MeV\nGamma_X = 320.0   # in MeV\n\n# Calculate the momentum term (pc) using the relativistic energy-momentum relation\npc = math.sqrt(E_X**2 - m_X_c2**2)\n\n# Calculate the relativistic factor gamma*beta\n# From p = gamma*m*v and v = beta*c, we get pc = gamma*beta*(mc^2)\ngamma_beta = pc / m_X_c2\n\n# Calculate the mean proper decay length (c*tau)\nc_tau = hbar_c / Gamma_X\n\n# The mean decay distance in the lab frame is L = gamma*beta*c*tau\nL_fm = gamma_beta * c_tau\n\n# Convert the distance from femtometers (fm) to meters (m)\n# 1 fm = 1e-15 m\nL_m = L_fm * 1e-15\n\n# Print the result in scientific notation with 4 decimal places to match the options\nprint(f\"{L_m:.4e}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\n4.0655e-15\n</execute_result>\nThe result of the calculation is $4.0655 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}$.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m\nB) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m\nC) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m\nD) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
