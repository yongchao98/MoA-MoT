Identify the System as a Separable Harmonic Oscillator**\n\nThe potential V(x, y) is now in the form:\nV(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)\nwhere:\n*   V_x(x) = 2 * k * x^2\n*   V_y(y) = 1/2 * k * y^2\n\nThis is the potential for a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator. Because the potential is separable, the time-independent Schrödinger equation can be separated into two independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillator problems, one for the x-coordinate and one for the y-coordinate. The total energy E will be the sum of the energies from each dimension, E = E_x + E_y.\n\n**3.

    "This is a quantum mechanics problem asking for the energy spectrum of a particle in a two-dimensional potential. The standard approach for such problems is to analyze the potential and see if the Schrödinger equation can be solved. Often, this involves changing the coordinate system to simplify the potential, which may reveal a separable problem.\n\n**1. Express the Potential in Cartesian Coordinates**\n\nThe potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ):\n`V(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)`\n\nTo simplify the problem, we will convert the potential into Cartesian coordinates (x, y). The relationships between polar and Cartesian coordinates are:\n*   `x = r cos(θ)`\n*   `y = r sin(θ)`\n*   `r^2 = x^2 + y^2`\n\nFrom these, we can see that `x^2 = r^2 cos^2(θ)`. Substituting `r^2` and `r^2 cos^2(θ)` into the potential expression gives:\n`V(x, y) = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 kx^2`\n\nNow, we can combine the terms involving `x^2`:\n`V(x, y) = (1/2 k + 3/2 k)x^2 + 1/2 ky^2`\n`V(x, y) = (4/2 k)x^2 + 1/2 ky^2`\n`V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2`\n\n**2. Identify the Separable System**\n\nThe potential in Cartesian coordinates is `V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)`, where:\n*   `V_x(x) = 2kx^2`\n*   `V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2`\n\nThis is the potential for a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator. Because the potential is a sum of two independent functions, one of `x` and one of `y`, the time-independent Schrödinger equation is separable. This means we can solve the problem as two separate one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillators, and the total energy will be the sum of the energies from each dimension: `E = E_x + E_y`.\n\n**3. Solve for the Energy of Each 1D Oscillator**\n\nThe general form for the potential of a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO) is `V(q) = 1/2 k_{eff} q^2` or `V(q) = 1/2 mω^2 q^2`.

Combine to Find the Total Energy Spectrum**\n\nThe total energy `E` is the sum of the energies for the independent x and y motions:\n`E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}`\n`E = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * (2 * sqrt(k/m)) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)`\n\nNow, we factor out the common term `ħ * sqrt(k/m)`:\n`E = [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] * ħ * sqrt(k/m)`\n`E = [2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2] * ħ * sqrt(k/m)`\n`E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ħ * sqrt(k/m)`\n\nHere, `n_x` and `n_y` are the quantum numbers for the x and y oscillators, respectively, and they can be any non-negative integer (`n_x, n_y = 0, 1, 2, ...`).\n\n**5.

You can also solve the question without code and searching, just by your textual reasoning.\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code or search queries to solve the problem.\n\n    question: A quantum mechanical particle of mass m moves in two dimensions in the following potential, as a function of (r,θ): V (r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)\nFind the energy spectrum.\n\nA) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\nB) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nC) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nD) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n",
