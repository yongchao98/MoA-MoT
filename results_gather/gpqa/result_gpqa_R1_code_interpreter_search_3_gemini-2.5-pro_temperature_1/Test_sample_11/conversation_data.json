    "This is a problem about particle decay, which can be solved using the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum in the framework of special relativity.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the process and given information:**\n    *   The decay process is: Pi(+) -> mu(+) + nu\n    *   The initial particle, the positive pion (Pi+), is stationary.\n    *   Rest energy of Pi(+) (m_pi * c^2) = 139.6 MeV.\n    *   Rest energy of mu(+) (m_mu * c^2) = 105.7 MeV.\n    *   The neutrino (nu) is assumed to be massless, so its rest energy (m_nu * c^2) is 0 MeV.\n\n2.  **Apply Conservation of Momentum:**\n    *   Since the initial pion is stationary, its initial momentum is zero (p_initial = 0).\n    *   To conserve momentum, the total momentum of the product particles must also be zero. This means the muon (mu+) and the neutrino (nu) must travel in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n    *   Let `p` be the magnitude of the momentum of both the muon and the neutrino. So, |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p.\n\n3.  **Apply Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n    *   Energy before = Rest energy of the stationary pion = E_pi = 139.6 MeV.\n    *   Energy after = Total energy of the muon (E_mu) + Total energy of the neutrino (E_nu).\n    *   Therefore, E_pi = E_mu + E_nu.\n\n4.  **Use the Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\n    *   The total energy E of a particle is related to its rest mass `m` and momentum `p` by the equation: E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2.\n    *   For the muon (mu+): E_mu = sqrt((pc)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2)\n    *   For the massless neutrino (nu): E_nu = sqrt((pc)^2 + 0^2) = pc.\n\n5.  **Solve for the Unknown Momentum:**\n    *   Substitute the expressions for E_mu and E_nu into the energy conservation equation:\n        139.6 MeV = sqrt((pc)^2 + (105.7 MeV)^2) + pc\n    *   Rearrange the equation to solve for `pc`:\n        139.6 - pc = sqrt((pc)^2 + 105.7^2)\n    *   Square both sides of the equation:\n        (139.6 - pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + 105.7^2\n        139.6^2 - 2 * 139.6 * pc + (pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + 105.7^2\n    *   The (pc)^2 terms cancel out:\n        139.6^2 - 105.7^2 = 2 * 139.6 * pc\n    *   Solve for `pc`:\n        pc = (139.6^2 - 105.7^2) / (2 * 139.6)\n        pc = (19488.16 - 11172.49) / 279.2\n        pc = 8315.67 / 279.2\n        pc ≈ 29.78 MeV\n\n6.  **Calculate the Kinetic Energies (KE):**\n    *   The kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest energy (KE = E - mc^2).\n    *   **For the neutrino (nu):**\n        Since it's massless, its rest energy is 0.
