    "Here is my thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** I first need to understand what information is given and what the question is asking for.\n    *   **Given:**\n        *   Two star-planet systems (System 1 and System 2).\n        *   Star masses are equal: $M_{s1} = M_{s2}$.\n        *   Planet masses are equal: $m_{p1} = m_{p2}$.\n        *   Orbits are circular.\n        *   Detection method is Radial Velocity (RV).\n        *   Maximum periodic wavelength shift for Star 1 ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max,1}$) = 5 milliangstroms.\n        *   Maximum periodic wavelength shift for Star 2 ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max,2}$) = 7 milliangstroms.\n    *   **Question:** What is the ratio of the orbital periods, $T_2 / T_1$?\n\n2.  **Relate Observations to Physical Quantities:** The RV method measures the Doppler shift of light from a star. The wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$) along our line of sight. The maximum wavelength shift corresponds to the maximum radial velocity, which is the amplitude of the RV signal, denoted as $K$.\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda \\propto v_r$\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_{max} \\propto K$\n    *   Therefore, the ratio of the RV amplitudes is the same as the ratio of the maximum wavelength shifts:\n        $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max,2}}{\\Delta\\lambda_{max,1}} = \\frac{7 \\text{ mÅ}}{5 \\text{ mÅ}} = 1.4$\n\n3.  **Find the Physics Connecting RV Amplitude (K) and Orbital Period (T):** I need to find the formula that links $K$ and $T$.\n    *   The RV amplitude, $K$, is the maximum line-of-sight velocity of the star. For a circular orbit, this is given by $K = v_{star} \\sin(i)$, where $v_{star}$ is the star's orbital speed around the system's barycenter and $i$ is the inclination of the orbit relative to our line of sight.\n    *   By conservation of momentum between the star and the planet: $M_{star} v_{star} = m_{planet} v_{planet}$. This gives us $v_{star} = \\frac{m_{planet}}{M_{star}} v_{planet}$.\n    *   The planet's orbital speed is $v_{planet} = \\frac{2\\pi a}{T}$, where $a$ is the semi-major axis (orbital radius for a circular orbit) and $T$ is the orbital period.\n    *   Substituting these into the expression for $K$:\n        $K = \\left( \\frac{m_{planet}}{M_{star}} v_{planet} \\right) \\sin(i) = \\frac{m_{planet} \\sin(i)}{M_{star}} \\left( \\frac{2\\pi a}{T} \\right)$\n\n4.  **Introduce Kepler's Third Law:** The formula for $K$ currently has two variables, $a$ and $T$. I need to eliminate one. Kepler's Third Law relates $a$ and $T$.\n    *   $T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G(M_{star} + m_{planet})} a^3$.\n    *   Since the planets are Neptune-mass and the stars are Sun-mass, $m_{planet} \\ll M_{star}$. So, we can approximate this as $T^2 \\approx \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G M_{star}} a^3$.\n    *   I need to express $a$ in terms of $T$ to substitute it back into the equation for $K$. Rearranging Kepler's Law:\n        $a^3 = \\frac{G M_{star} T^2}{4\\pi^2} \\implies a = \\left( \\frac{G M_{star} T^2}{4\\pi^2} \\right)^{1/3}$\n\n5.  **Combine the Equations to Find the Final Proportionality:** Now I substitute the expression for $a$ into the equation for $K$.\n    *   $K = \\frac{m_{planet} \\sin(i)}{M_{star}} \\frac{2\\pi}{T} \\left( \\frac{G M_{star} T^2}{4\\pi^2} \\right)^{1/3}$\n    *   Let's simplify this by looking at the dependencies:\n        $K \\propto \\frac{m_{planet} \\sin(i)}{M_{star}} \\frac{1}{T} (M_{star} T^2)^{1/3}$\n        $K \\propto \\frac{m_{planet} \\sin(i)}{M_{star}} T^{-1} M_{star}^{1/3} T^{2/3}$\n        $K \\propto \\frac{m_{planet} \\sin(i)}{M_{star}^{2/3}} T^{-1/3}$\n\n6.  **Apply the Specifics of the Problem:** Now I use the information given for the two systems to simplify the proportionality.\n    *   $m_{p1} = m_{p2}$ (masses are the same)\n    *   $M_{s1} = M_{s2}$ (star masses are the same)\n    *   The problem is solvable with a single answer, which implies we can assume the unknown inclinations are the same ($i_1 = i_2$). This is a standard assumption in such textbook problems.\n    *   With these conditions, all terms except $T$ are constant for both systems. The proportionality simplifies to:\n        $K \\propto T^{-1/3}$\n\n7.  **Solve for the Ratio of Periods:** Now I can use the ratio of the RV amplitudes ($K_2/K_1$) to find the ratio of the periods ($T_2/T_1$).\n    *   $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{T_2^{-1/3}}{T_1^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{-1/3}$\n    *   We already found that $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = 1.4$.\n    *   $1.4 = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{-1/3}$\n    *   To solve for $\\frac{T_2}{T_1}$, I need to raise both sides of the equation to the power of -3.\n    *   $(1.4)^{-3} = \\left( \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{-1/3} \\right)^{-3}$\n    *   $\\frac{1}{(1.4)^3} = \\frac{T_2}{T_1}$\n\n8.  **Calculate the Final Value:** I will perform the calculation. A quick mental check: Since the RV signal for planet #2 is stronger ($K_2 > K_1$), and $K \\propto T^{-1/3}$, its period must be shorter ($T_2 < T_1$). So the ratio $T_2/T_1$ must be less than 1. This helps validate the direction of my result. I'll use a calculator (or a simple Python script) for precision.\n    *   $1.4^2 = 1.96$\n    *   $1.96 \\times 1.4 = 2.744$\n    *   $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\frac{1}{2.744}$\n\nI'll use python to get the final decimal value.\n```python\n# The ratio of the RV amplitudes K2/K1 is equal to the ratio of the wavelength shifts.\nratio_K = 7.0 / 5.0\n\n# The relationship between RV amplitude K and orbital period T is K is proportional to T^(-1/3).\n# So, K2/K1 = (T2/T1)^(-1/3).\n# To find T2/T1, we raise both sides to the power of -3.\nratio_T = ratio_K**(-3)\n\nprint(ratio_T)\n```\n<execute_output>\n0.3644330043839841\n</execute_output>\nThe calculated value is approximately 0.3644.

This motion causes its spectral lines to shift to the blue and red, respectively.\n\n2.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to RV Amplitude (K):** The magnitude of the wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$) along our line of sight.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Connection between Measurement and Physical Velocity:** The problem describes the detection of planets using the Radial Velocity (RV) method. The measured quantity is the periodic shift of a spectral line, $\\Delta\\lambda$. This shift is directly proportional to the star's velocity along our line of sight. The maximum shift, $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$, corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star, which is called the RV semi-amplitude, $K$.
