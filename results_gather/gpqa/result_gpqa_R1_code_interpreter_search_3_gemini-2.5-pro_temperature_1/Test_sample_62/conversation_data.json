    "*   **1. Understand the Model and Energy Levels**\n    The problem describes a diatomic molecule using the quantum rotation-vibration model (or non-rigid rotor). The energy levels for this model are given by the sum of the vibrational and rotational energies:\n    `E(v, J) = (v + 1/2) * ħ * ω + B * J * (J + 1)`\n    where:\n    *   `v` is the vibrational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...).\n    *   `J` is the rotational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...).\n    *   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (`1.054 x 10^-34 J·s`).\n    *   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration.\n    *   `B` is the rotational constant, `B = ħ^2 / (2*I)`.\n    *   `I` is the moment of inertia, `I = μ * R^2`.\n    *   `μ` is the reduced mass, `μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)`.\n\n*   **2. Identify the Transition**\n    *   **Initial State:** The molecule is in its fundamental (ground) state. This is the state with the lowest possible energy, which corresponds to the lowest quantum numbers: `v = 0` and `J = 0`.\n        `E_initial = E(0, 0) = (1/2) * ħ * ω`\n    *   **Final State:** The molecule absorbs a photon and transitions to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy\". For rovibrational absorption spectroscopy, the selection rules are `Δv = +1` and `ΔJ = ±1`. Starting from `J = 0`, the only possible rotational transition is `ΔJ = +1` (since `J` cannot be negative).\n    *   Therefore, the final state is `v = 1` and `J = 1`.\n        `E_final = E(1, 1) = (1 + 1/2) * ħ * ω + B * 1 * (1 + 1) = (3/2) * ħ * ω + 2*B`\n\n*   **3. Calculate the Energy of the Absorbed Photon (ΔE)**\n    The energy of the photon must equal the energy difference between the final and initial states.\n    `ΔE = E_final - E_initial`\n    `ΔE = [(3/2) * ħ * ω + 2*B] - [(1/2) * ħ * ω]`\n    `ΔE = ħ * ω + 2*B`\n\n*   **4. Calculate the Necessary Physical Quantities**\n    We will perform the calculations in SI units.\n    *   **Given:**\n        *   Mx = 20 amu\n        *   My = 2 amu\n        *   R = 2 Å = `2 x 10^-10 m`\n        *   ω = `4 x 10^14 rad/s`\n    *   **Constants:**\n        *   1 amu = `1.66054 x 10^-27 kg`\n        *   ħ = `1.05457 x 10^-34 J·s`\n        *   c (speed of light) = `2.998 x 10^8 m/s`\n\n    *   **Calculations:**\n        1.  **Reduced Mass (μ):**\n            `μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) amu = 40 / 22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu`\n            `μ = 1.818 * (1.66054 x 10^-27 kg) ≈ 3.019 x 10^-27 kg`\n        2.  **Moment of Inertia (I):**\n            `I = μ * R^2 = (3.019 x 10^-27 kg) * (2 x 10^-10 m)^2 ≈ 1.208 x 10^-46 kg·m^2`\n        3.  **Rotational Constant (B):**\n            `B = ħ^2 / (2*I) = (1.05457 x 10^-34)^2 / (2 * 1.208 x 10^-46) ≈ 4.60 x 10^-23 J`\n        4.  **Energy Difference (ΔE):**\n            `ΔE = ħ * ω + 2*B`\n            `ΔE = (1.05457 x 10^-34 J·s) * (4 x 10^14 rad/s) + 2 * (4.60 x 10^-23 J)`\n            `ΔE = (4.218 x 10^-20 J) + (9.20 x 10^-23 J) ≈ 4.227 x 10^-20 J`\n            *(Note: The rotational energy contribution is much smaller than the vibrational energy contribution, which is typical).*\n\n*   **5. Calculate the Photon's Momentum (p)**\n    The energy of a photon is related to its momentum by the equation `E = p*c`. Therefore, the momentum is:\n    `p = ΔE / c`\n    `p = (4.227 x 10^-20 J) / (2.998 x 10^8 m/s) ≈ 1.41 x 10^-28 N·s`\n\nThis value is closest to option D. We can use a more precise calculation to confirm.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nh_bar = 1.054571817e-34  # J*s (reduced Planck constant)\namu_to_kg = 1.66053906660e-27 # kg/amu\nc = 2.99792458e8 # m/s (speed of light)\n\n# Given data\nMx_amu = 20\nMy_amu = 2\nR_angstrom = 2\nw_rad_s = 4e14\n\n# Convert to SI units\nR_m = R_angstrom * 1e-10\n\n# 1.
