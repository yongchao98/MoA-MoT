    "This problem requires us to first identify the physical process causing the observed spectral feature and then use that information to calculate a cosmological distance.\n\n**1. Identifying the Spectral Feature and Calculating Redshift (z):**\n\nThe observation describes a significant drop in flux for wavelengths shorter than a peak at 790 nm. This is a classic signature of the Lyman-alpha (Ly-α) forest and the Gunn-Peterson trough. The peak corresponds to the Ly-α emission line from the quasar itself, which has been redshifted by the expansion of the universe. The flux drop at shorter wavelengths is due to the absorption of the quasar's light by intervening neutral hydrogen gas along the line of sight.\n\nThe rest-frame wavelength of the Ly-α transition is λ_rest ≈ 121.6 nm.\nThe observed wavelength is λ_obs = 790 nm.\n\nThe redshift (z) is given by the formula:\n1 + z = λ_obs / λ_rest\nz = (λ_obs / λ_rest) - 1\nz = (790 nm / 121.6 nm) - 1\nz ≈ 6.497 - 1 = 5.497\n\nSo, the redshift of the quasar is approximately z ≈ 5.5.\n\n**2. Calculating the Comoving Distance (D_c):**\n\nNow, we need to calculate the comoving distance to an object at redshift z = 5.5 in the specified ΛCDM universe. The parameters are:\n*   Hubble constant, H₀ = 70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹\n*   Matter density parameter, Ω_m = 0.3\n*   Dark energy density parameter, Ω_Λ = 0.7\n*   The universe is flat, so the curvature density parameter, Ω_k = 0.\n\nThe formula for the comoving distance is:\nD_c = (c / H₀) * ∫[from 0 to z] dz' / E(z')\n\nwhere c is the speed of light and E(z) is the Hubble parameter normalized by H₀:\nE(z) = sqrt(Ω_m * (1 + z)³ + Ω_k * (1 + z)² + Ω_Λ)\n\nSince Ω_k = 0, this simplifies to:\nE(z) = sqrt(Ω_m * (1 + z)³ + Ω_Λ)\n\nThis integral does not have a simple analytical solution and must be computed numerically. We can use a Python script to perform this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\n# Define cosmological parameters\nH0 = 70.0  # Hubble constant in km/s/Mpc\nc = 299792.458  # Speed of light in km/s\nOmega_m = 0.3  # Matter density parameter\nOmega_Lambda = 0.7  # Dark energy density parameter\n\n# Redshift of the quasar\nz = 5.497\n\n# Define the integrand for the comoving distance integral\n# E(z') = sqrt(Omega_m * (1 + z')^3 + Omega_Lambda)\ndef integrand(z_prime):\n    return 1.0 / np.sqrt(Omega_m * (1 + z_prime)**3 + Omega_Lambda)\n\n# Perform the numerical integration from 0 to z\nintegral_result, error = quad(integrand, 0, z)\n\n# Calculate the Hubble distance in Mpc\nDh = c / H0\n\n# Calculate the comoving distance in Mpc\nDc_Mpc = Dh * integral_result\n\n# Convert the comoving distance to Gpc\nDc_Gpc = Dc_Mpc / 1000.0\n\nprint(f\"{Dc_Gpc=}\")\n```\nDc_Gpc=8.888126857943534\n\nThe numerical calculation gives a comoving distance of approximately 8.89 Gpc.\n\n**3.

    "The user wants me to solve a problem in cosmology. I will break down the problem into two main parts. First, I need to interpret the observational data to find the redshift of the quasar. Second, I will use this redshift and the provided cosmological parameters to calculate the comoving distance.\n\n**Part 1: Determining the Redshift (z)**\n\nThe problem describes a key feature in the quasar's spectrum: a peak at 790 nm and a significant drop in flux at shorter wavelengths. This is a classic signature of the Lyman-alpha (Ly-α) emission line from a high-redshift object. The quasar emits light across a wide spectrum, but the light at wavelengths shorter than the Ly-α line (in the quasar's rest frame) gets absorbed by the neutral hydrogen gas located between the quasar and us. This absorption creates a sharp drop, known as the Gunn-Peterson trough. The peak at 790 nm, therefore, corresponds to the Ly-α emission line, which has been stretched (redshifted) by the expansion of the universe.\n\nThe rest-frame wavelength of the Lyman-alpha transition (the n=2 to n=1 electron transition in neutral hydrogen) is λ_rest ≈ 121.6 nm.\nThe observed wavelength is λ_obs = 790 nm.\n\nThe redshift (z) is defined by the formula:\n1 + z = λ_obs / λ_rest\n\nWe can calculate z as follows:\nz = (λ_obs / λ_rest) - 1\nz = (790 nm / 121.6 nm) - 1\nz ≈ 6.4967 - 1\nz ≈ 5.497\n\nSo, the redshift of the quasar is approximately z = 5.5.\n\n**Part 2: Calculating the Comoving Distance (D_c)**\n\nNow, I need to calculate the line-of-sight comoving distance to an object at z ≈ 5.5 in the specified ΛCDM (Lambda-Cold Dark Matter) cosmological model.
