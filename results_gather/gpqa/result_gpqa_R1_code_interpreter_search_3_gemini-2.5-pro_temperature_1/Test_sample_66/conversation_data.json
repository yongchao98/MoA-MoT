    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the initial state:** The system of two electrons is in a coupled angular momentum state given by $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n    *   $l_1 = 1$ is the orbital angular momentum quantum number of the first electron.\n    *   $l_2 = 1$ is the orbital angular momentum quantum number of the second electron.\n    *   $l = 2$ is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the two-electron system.\n    *   $m = -1$ is the magnetic quantum number for the total orbital angular momentum, corresponding to the z-component of the total angular momentum. The eigenvalue of the total angular momentum operator $\\hat{L}_z$ is $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the state to be measured (the final state):** We are measuring the z-components of the orbital angular momentum for each electron, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. We want to find the joint probability of getting the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$ for both.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $\\hat{L}_{1z}$ is $m_1\\hbar$. For this to be $-\\hbar$, we must have $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $\\hat{L}_{2z}$ is $m_2\\hbar$. For this to be $-\\hbar$, we must have $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   This corresponds to the system being found in the uncoupled state $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2> = |1, -1; 1, -1>$.\n\n3.  **Relate the initial and final states:** The probability of finding the system in the final state, given it was in the initial state, is the square of the magnitude of the inner product of the two state vectors.\n    *   Probability $P = |< \\text{final state} | \\text{initial state} >|^2$.\n    *   $P = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>|^2$.\n\n4.  **Apply the rules of angular momentum addition:** The vector operator for the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual angular momentum operators: $\\vec{L} = \\vec{L_1} + \\vec{L_2}$. This implies that the z-component operator is also additive: $\\hat{L}_z = \\hat{L}_{1z} + \\hat{L}_{2z}$.\n\n5.  **Use the selection rule for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients:** The inner product $<l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m>$ is known as a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. A fundamental property, derived from the additive nature of the z-component operators, is that this coefficient is non-zero only if the magnetic quantum numbers satisfy the relation:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n\n6.  **Check the selection rule for this specific problem:**\n    *   From the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$, we have the total magnetic quantum number $m = -1$.\n    *   From the desired final state $|1, -1; 1, -1>$, we have the individual magnetic quantum numbers $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   Let's check the sum: $m_1 + m_2 = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   We compare $m$ and $m_1+m_2$. Here, $-1 \\neq -2$.\n\n7.  **Calculate the probability:** Since the condition $m = m_1 + m_2$ is not met, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero:\n    *   $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1> = 0$.\n    *   Therefore, the probability is $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe measurement of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ is equivalent to a measurement of the total z-component of angular momentum $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. The initial state is an eigenstate of $L_z$ with an eigenvalue of $-1\\hbar$. The desired measurement outcome corresponds to a state where the total z-component of angular momentum would be $(-1 + -1)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$. Since the system is in a definite state of total z-angular momentum, the probability of measuring a different value is zero.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the initial and final states.**\n    *   The initial state of the two-electron system is the coupled angular momentum state `|ψ_initial> = |l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>`.\n        *   This tells us the total angular momentum quantum number is `l = 2`.\n        *   The z-component of the total angular momentum quantum number is `m = -1`. This means the system is in an eigenstate of the total angular momentum z-component operator, `L_z`, with a definite eigenvalue of `mħ = -ħ`.\n    *   The question asks for the probability of measuring the individual z-components of angular momentum. The desired outcome is:\n        *   For electron 1, the eigenvalue of `L_{1z}` is `-ħ`. This corresponds to the magnetic quantum number `m_1 = -1`.\n        *   For electron 2, the eigenvalue of `L_{2z}` is `-ħ`. This corresponds to the magnetic quantum number `m_2 = -1`.\n    *   This measurement outcome corresponds to finding the system in the uncoupled state `|ψ_final> = |l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2> = |1, -1; 1, -1>`.\n\n2.  **Formulate the probability calculation.**\n    The probability `P` of finding the system in the state `|ψ_final>` after a measurement, given that it was initially in `|ψ_initial>`, is given by the square of the magnitude of the inner product of the two states:\n    `P = |<ψ_final | ψ_initial>|^2`\n    Substituting the states:\n    `P = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>|^2`\n\n3.  **Apply the principles of angular momentum addition.**\n    The operator for the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-component operators:\n    `L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}`\n    This leads to a fundamental selection rule for the magnetic quantum numbers: for the inner product (which is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient) to be non-zero, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers must equal the total magnetic quantum number.\n    `m = m_1 + m_2`\n\n4.  **Check the selection rule for this problem.**\n    *   From the initial state `|1, 1, 2, -1>`, we have `m = -1`.\n    *   From the desired final state `|1, -1; 1, -1>`, we have `m_1 = -1` and `m_2 = -1`.\n    *   Let's check the sum: `m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2`.\n    *   Now, we compare `m` with the sum `m_1 + m_2`:\n        `-1 ≠ -2`\n\n5.  **Conclusion.**\n    Since the condition `m = m_1 + m_2` is not satisfied, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient `<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>` is zero.\n    Therefore, the probability `P` is:\n    `P = |0|^2 = 0`\n\n**Alternative Reasoning:**\nThe initial state `|1, 1, 2, -1>` is an eigenstate of the total angular momentum z-component operator `L_z` with a definite eigenvalue of `-ħ`. A measurement of `L_z` on this state will *always* yield `-ħ`.\nThe desired measurement outcome corresponds to a state where `m_1 = -1` and `m_2 = -1`. If the system were in this state, a measurement of the total angular momentum z-component `L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}` would yield `(-1 + -1)ħ = -2ħ`.\nSince the system is in a definite state of `L_z` with eigenvalue `-ħ`, the probability of measuring it to have a different value, such as `-2ħ`, is zero.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Initial State:** The system is composed of two electrons, and its state is described by the coupled angular momentum state vector $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   $l_1 = 1$: The orbital angular momentum quantum number of the first electron.\n    *   $l_2 = 1$: The orbital angular momentum quantum number of the second electron.\n    *   $l = 2$: The total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the two-electron system.\n    *   $m = -1$: The magnetic quantum number corresponding to the z-component of the *total* orbital angular momentum. This means the system is in an eigenstate of the total angular momentum z-component operator, $\\hat{L}_z$, with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Understand the Measurement and Final State:** We are performing a measurement of the individual z-components of orbital angular momentum for each electron, $\\hat{L}_{1z}$ and $\\hat{L}_{2z}$. We want to find the probability of a specific outcome:\n    *   The eigenvalue of $\\hat{L}_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the magnetic quantum number for the first electron being $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $\\hat{L}_{2z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the magnetic quantum number for the second electron being $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   This desired outcome corresponds to finding the system in the uncoupled state $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Relate the States and Calculate the Probability:** The probability of finding the system in the final state after the measurement, given it was in the initial state, is the square of the magnitude of the inner product of the two state vectors.\n    *   Probability $P = |\\langle \\text{final state} | \\text{initial state} \\rangle|^2$\n    *   $P = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$\n\n4.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum:** The operator for the total z-component of angular momentum is the sum of the individual operators: $\\hat{L}_z = \\hat{L}_{1z} + \\hat{L}_{2z}$. This physical relationship imposes a strict selection rule on the quantum numbers. For the inner product (which is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient) to be non-zero, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers ($m_1, m_2$) must equal the total magnetic quantum number ($m$).\n    *   Selection Rule: $m = m_1 + m_2$\n\n5.  **Check the Selection Rule for This Problem:**\n    *   From the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, we have the total magnetic quantum number $m = -1$.\n    *   From the desired final state $|1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$, we have the individual magnetic quantum numbers $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   Let's check if the selection rule is satisfied:\n        $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$\n    *   Comparing the required total $m$ with the sum of the individual components:\n        $-1 \\neq -2$\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Since the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is not met, the inner product $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle$ must be zero. Consequently, the probability is zero.\n    *   $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\nThis result makes physical sense. The initial state has a definite total z-component of angular momentum of $-1\\hbar$. The final state would have a total z-component of angular momentum of $(-1\\hbar) + (-1\\hbar) = -2\\hbar$. A system cannot simultaneously be in a state with total $L_z = -1\\hbar$ and be found to have a total $L_z = -2\\hbar$. The probability of such an outcome is zero.\n\n<<<C>>>",
