    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays of the $X^0$ particle. In this context, \"resolution\" refers to the minimum track length of the $X^0$ particle that the bubble chamber detector can measure before it decays. If a particle decays after traveling a distance shorter than the detector's resolution, its track is not \"observed\".\n\n2.  **Formulate the Physics:**\n    *   **Relativistic Effects:** The particle is moving at a relativistic speed, so its lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau_{lab}$) is longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) due to time dilation. The relationship is $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** The Lorentz factor can be calculated from the particle's total energy ($E$) and its rest mass ($m_0$). The formula is $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$, so $\\gamma = E / (m_0 c^2)$.\n    *   **Decay Law:** The decay of unstable particles follows an exponential law. The probability that a particle travels a distance $x$ before decaying is described by the probability density function $f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda}e^{-x/\\lambda}$, where $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length in the lab frame.\n    *   **Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):** This is the average distance a particle travels before decaying in the lab frame. It's given by $\\lambda = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity.\n    *   **Observation Condition:** To \"observe\" a decay, the particle's track length ($x$) must be greater than the detector's resolution ($\\Delta x$). The fraction of decays that can be observed is the probability that the decay distance is greater than the resolution, i.e., $P(x > \\Delta x)$. We are given that this fraction must be at least 30% ($0.3$).\n\n3.  **Step-by-Step Calculation:**\n\n    *   **Step 3a: Calculate the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$).**\n        Given: $E = 27$ GeV, $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV.\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0 c^2} = \\frac{27}{3.41}$\n\n    *   **Step 3b: Calculate the mean decay length ($\\lambda$).**\n        The particle is highly relativistic. The velocity $v$ is related to $\\gamma$ by $v = c\\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$.\n        The mean decay length is $\\lambda = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab} = (c\\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}) \\cdot (\\gamma \\tau_0) = c \\tau_0 \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$.\n        Given: $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s, and $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s.\n\n    *   **Step 3c: Set up the observation condition.**\n        The fraction of observed decays is $P(x > \\Delta x) = \\int_{\\Delta x}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\lambda}e^{-x/\\lambda} dx = e^{-\\Delta x / \\lambda}$.\n        We need this fraction to be at least 30%:\n        $e^{-\\Delta x / \\lambda} \\ge 0.3$\n        Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        $-\\frac{\\Delta x}{\\lambda} \\ge \\ln(0.3)$\n        $\\frac{\\Delta x}{\\lambda} \\le -\\ln(0.3)$\n        $\\Delta x \\le -\\lambda \\ln(0.3)$\n        The question asks for the \"minimum resolution needed\". This is interpreted as the coarsest resolution (largest $\\Delta x$) that still satisfies the condition. Thus, we take the equality:\n        $\\Delta x = -\\lambda \\ln(0.3)$\n\n4.  **Execute the Calculation:**\n    Let's use a Python script to perform the calculation with precision.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Physical constants\nc = 299792458  # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# Given values\ntau0 = 8e-16  # proper lifetime in s\nE = 27  # Energy in GeV\nm0 = 3.41  # Rest mass in GeV/c^2\n\n# 1.

    "The user has asked for a solution to a physics problem regarding particle decay in a bubble chamber.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Problem:**\n\n*   **Particle Decay:** A neutral particle $X^0$ decays into two charged particles $Y^+$ and $Z^-$.\n*   **Proper Lifetime ($\\tau_0$):** The lifetime of $X^0$ in its own rest frame is $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s.\n*   **Lab Frame Energy (E):** The total energy of the $X^0$ particle in the lab (bubble chamber) frame is $E = 27$ GeV.\n*   **Rest Mass ($m_0$):** The rest mass of the $X^0$ particle is $m_0 = 3.41$ GeV/$c^2$. (Note: Mass is often given in units of GeV, which implicitly means GeV/$c^2$).\n*   **Observation Condition:** We need to find the minimum resolution ($\\Delta x$) required to observe at least 30% of the decays.

Step-by-step Calculation Plan:**\n\n*   **Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$).**\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0 c^2}$. The units (GeV) will cancel out.\n*   **Step 2: Calculate the particle's velocity ($v$).**\n    The velocity can be found from the Lorentz factor: $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$. It is often easier to work with the term $\\beta = v/c = \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$. Since $\\gamma$ will be large, $\\beta \\approx 1$.\n*   **Step 3: Calculate the mean decay length ($\\lambda$) in the lab frame.**\n    $\\lambda = v \\tau_{lab} = v (\\gamma \\tau_0) = (c\\beta)(\\gamma \\tau_0) = c \\tau_0 (\\beta\\gamma)$.\n    We know that $\\beta\\gamma = \\frac{v}{c} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}} = \\frac{p}{m_0 c}$, where $p$ is the momentum. We can also use the energy-momentum relation $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$ to find $p$.\n    $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2}$.\n    So, $\\lambda = c \\tau_0 \\frac{p}{m_0 c} = \\frac{\\tau_0}{m_0} p = \\frac{\\tau_0 c}{m_0 c^2} \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2}$.\n*   **Step 4: Apply the observation condition.**\n    We want to observe at least 30% of the decays. This means the track length $x$ must be greater than the resolution $\\Delta x$. The fraction of particles that travel a distance greater than $\\Delta x$ is given by the survival probability:\n    $P(x > \\Delta x) = e^{-\\Delta x / \\lambda}$.\n    We are given $P(x > \\Delta x) \\ge 0.30$.\n    $e^{-\\Delta x / \\lambda} \\ge 0.30$.\n    To find the boundary condition (the \"minimum\" or, more accurately, the *coarsest* acceptable resolution), we set it as an equality:\n    $e^{-\\Delta x / \\lambda} = 0.30$.\n*   **Step 5: Solve for the resolution ($\\Delta x$).**\n    $-\\frac{\\Delta x}{\\lambda} = \\ln(0.30)$\n    $\\Delta x = -\\lambda \\ln(0.30)$\n\n**4.

    "Here is a detailed breakdown of the solution:\n\n### 1. Understand the Goal\n\nThe question asks for the minimum resolution of the bubble chamber required to \"observe\" at least 30% of the decays. In particle physics, observing a decay means detecting the track of the parent particle before it decays. Therefore, the particle must travel a distance ($x$) greater than the detector's resolution ($\\Delta x$) for its track to be resolved. We need to find the value of $\\Delta x$ such that the probability of the particle traveling further than this distance is at least 30% ($P(x > \\Delta x) \\ge 0.3$).\n\n### 2. Identify the Physical Principles\n\n*   **Special Relativity:** The particle has a total energy ($E = 27$ GeV) much greater than its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV), so it is moving at a relativistic speed. This means we must account for time dilation and the relativistic relationship between energy and momentum.\n*   **Particle Decay Law:** The decay of unstable particles is a random process governed by an exponential decay law. The probability that a particle travels a distance $x$ or more before decaying in the lab frame is given by:\n    $P(x > \\Delta x) = e^{-\\Delta x / \\lambda}$\n    where $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length in the lab frame.\n*   **Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):** The average distance a particle travels before decaying depends on its momentum ($p$), proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$), and rest mass ($m_0$). The formula is:\n    $\\lambda = \\frac{p}{m_0}\\tau_0$\n*   **Energy-Momentum Relation:** To find the momentum, we use the fundamental equation of special relativity:\n    $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Calculation\n\nThe calculation will be performed using a Python script to ensure accuracy.\n\n1.  **Calculate Momentum ($pc$):** Rearrange the energy-momentum relation to solve for $pc$:\n    $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2}$\n2.  **Calculate Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$):** Use the formula $\\lambda = \\frac{p \\tau_0}{m_0}$, which can be written with more convenient units as $\\lambda = \\left(\\frac{pc}{m_0c^2}\\right) \\cdot c \\cdot \\tau_0$.\n3.  **Solve for the Resolution ($\\Delta x$):** Use the decay probability formula. We need to find $\\Delta x$ that satisfies $e^{-\\Delta x / \\lambda} \\ge 0.3$. To find the coarsest possible resolution that meets this requirement, we solve the equation for the boundary case:\n    $e^{-\\Delta x / \\lambda} = 0.3$\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives:\n    $-\\frac{\\Delta x}{\\lambda} = \\ln(0.3)$\n    $\\Delta x = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.3)$\n\nLet's execute the calculation with a script.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given physical constants and values from the problem\nE_GeV = 27.0         # Total energy in GeV\nm0c2_GeV = 3.41      # Rest mass energy in GeV\ntau0_s = 8e-16         # Proper lifetime in seconds\nc_ms = 299792458.0     # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# 1. Calculate the momentum (pc) in GeV\npc_GeV = np.sqrt(E_GeV**2 - m0c2_GeV**2)\n\n# 2. Calculate the mean decay length (lambda) in meters\n# lambda = (p/m0)*tau0 = (pc/m0c2)*c*tau0\nmean_decay_length_m = (pc_GeV / m0c2_GeV) * c_ms * tau0_s\n\n# 3. Calculate the required resolution (delta_x) in meters\n# We need to observe at least 30% of decays, so P(x > delta_x) >= 0.3\n# This means exp(-delta_x / lambda) >= 0.3\n# Solving for the limiting case: delta_x = -lambda * ln(0.3)\nfraction_to_observe = 0.3\nresolution_m = -mean_decay_length_m * np.log(fraction_to_observe)\n\nprint(f\"{resolution_m}\")\n```\n2.267923758368819e-06\n\n### 4. Final Answer\n\nThe calculation gives a required resolution of approximately $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ meters. Comparing this result with the given options:\n\nA) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\nB) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\nC) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\nD) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\n\nThe calculated value is very close to option B. The minor discrepancy between $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ and $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ is likely due to the precision of the constants provided in the problem statement. Option B is the only physically plausible choice.\n\n<<<B>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\n\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\n\nIf you lack the related knowledge, you can use the Google Search Tool to search the web and get the information.\nYou can call a search query with the format of <search>your search query</search>, e.g., <search>Who is the current president of US?</search>. The searched results will be returned between <information> and </information>.\nOnce the search query is complete, stop the generation. Then, the search platform will return the searched results.\n\nIf you need to search the web, do not generate code in the same response. Vice versa.
