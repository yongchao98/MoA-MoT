    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material**\n    The starting material is 5-butylnona-2,6-diene. Let's draw its structure.\n    *   \"nona\" indicates a 9-carbon main chain.\n    *   \"2,6-diene\" indicates two double bonds, starting at carbon 2 and carbon 6. The double bonds are between C2-C3 and C6-C7.\n    *   \"5-butyl\" indicates a butyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃) is attached to carbon 5.\n\n    The structure is:\n    CH₃(1)-CH(2)=CH(3)-CH₂(4)-CH(5)(C₄H₉)-CH(6)=CH(7)-CH₂(8)-CH₃(9)\n    The total number of carbons is 9 (nonane) + 4 (butyl) = 13.\n    The molecular formula is C₁₃H₂₄. Any product of rearrangement must also have this formula.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction Type**\n    The problem states that the molecule is heated. Heating a diene, especially one where the double bonds are separated by a few single bonds, strongly suggests a pericyclic reaction. The options provided are all isomers of the starting material, which points towards a rearrangement reaction.\n\n    Let's examine the arrangement of the double bonds. The double bonds are at C2=C3 and C6=C7. The chain of atoms connecting them is C3-C4-C5-C6. This creates a C=C-C-C-C=C pattern, which is the characteristic structure of a 1,5-diene. (The '1' and '5' refer to the relative positions in the six-carbon system that rearranges, not necessarily the IUPAC numbering).\n\n    The thermal rearrangement of a 1,5-diene is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement known as the **Cope Rearrangement**.\n\n3.  **Apply the Cope Rearrangement Mechanism**\n    The Cope rearrangement involves a 6-carbon, 1,5-diene system. In our molecule, this system consists of carbons C2 through C7.\n    Let's number these six carbons from 1' to 6' for clarity during the mechanism analysis:\n    C2(1')=C3(2')-C4(3')-C5(4')-C6(5')=C7(6')\n\n    The Cope rearrangement mechanism dictates the following bond changes:\n    *   The sigma bond between atoms 3' and 4' (C4-C5) breaks.\n    *   A new sigma bond forms between atoms 1' and 6' (C2-C7).\n    *   The π bond between 1' and 2' (C2=C3) moves to between 2' and 3' (C3=C4).\n    *   The π bond between 5' and 6' (C6=C7) moves to between 4' and 5' (C4=C5). No, this is incorrect. The standard product connectivity is `C4=C5-C6-C1-C2=C3`.\n\n    Let's use the correct connectivity for the product backbone: the original atoms rearrange to form a new chain with the connectivity `(atom 4')=(atom 5')-(atom 6')-(atom 1')-(atom 2')=(atom 3')`.\n\n4.  **Determine the Structure of the Product**\n    Now, let's map the substituents from our starting molecule onto this new backbone.\n    *   Atom 1' (C2) is attached to a methyl group (C1) and a hydrogen.\n    *   Atom 2' (C3) is attached to a hydrogen.\n    *   Atom 3' (C4) is attached to two hydrogens.\n    *   Atom 4' (C5) is attached to a butyl group and a hydrogen.\n    *   Atom 5' (C6) is attached to a hydrogen.\n    *   Atom 6' (C7) is attached to an ethyl group (C8-C9) and a hydrogen.\n\n    Let's construct the product by assembling the pieces according to the new connectivity `C5=C6-C7-C2-C3=C4`:\n    *   Start with `C5=C6`: The group on C5 is butyl. The group on C6 is H. So, `(C₄H₉)CH=`\n    *   Attach `C7`: `(C₄H₉)CH=CH-CH(C₂H₅)-`\n    *   Attach `C2`: `(C₄H₉)CH=CH-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(CH₃)-`\n    *   Attach `C3=C4`: `(C₄H₉)CH=CH-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(CH₃)-CH=CH₂`\n\n    The resulting product structure is:\n    CH₃CH₂CH₂CH₂-CH=CH-CH(CH₂CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-CH=CH₂\n\n5.  **Name the Product and Compare with Options**\n    We need to find the IUPAC name for the product:\n    `Bu-CH=CH-CH(Et)-CH(Me)-CH=CH₂`\n    *   **Find the longest carbon chain** containing both double bonds. We can start from the right end (the `CH₂` group) and go left, into the butyl group.\n        `CH₂(1)=CH(2)-CH(Me)(3)-CH(Et)(4)-CH(5)=CH(6)-CH₂(7)-CH₂(8)-CH₂(9)-CH₃(10)`\n    *   The longest chain has 10 carbons, so it is a \"deca-\" chain.\n    *   There are two double bonds starting at C1 and C5, so it is a \"deca-1,5-diene\".\n    *   There is a methyl group on C3 and an ethyl group on C4.\n    *   Listing the substituents alphabetically, the name is **4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene**.\n\n    Now, let's compare this name with the given options:\n    A) 5-ethylundeca-2,6-diene\n    B) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene\n    C) 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene\n    D) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene\n\n    Our derived name matches option C exactly.\n\nFinal check using Python to verify isomerism (same molecular formula).\nStarting Material: 5-butylnona-2,6-diene -> C9H16 (nona-diene) + C4H9 (butyl) - 1H (attachment) = C13H24.\nProduct C: 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene -> C10H18 (deca-diene) + C2H5 (ethyl) + CH3 (methyl) - 2H (attachments) = C13H24.\nThe formulas match.\n\n```python\n# No code is needed as the reasoning is based on chemical principles.\n# The step-by-step derivation of the product structure and its IUPAC name is sufficient.\n# 1.
