    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clue about Substance B:** The problem states that substance B has a melting point \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope Deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    *   This is a very strong match. Therefore, substance **B is heavy water, D₂O**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Clues about G and the Heavier Isotope:**\n    *   Substance G, when heated, releases B (D₂O). This indicates that G is a deuterated hydrate or a deuteroxide, a compound that releases D₂O upon thermal decomposition.\n    *   Since D₂O is formed, the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned in the first clue must be **Deuterium (D)**, which is an isotope of the element Hydrogen.\n    *   This means substance X must contain Deuterium.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Organic Chemistry Clue:**\n    *   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" A keto acid has the general formula R-C(=O)-COOH, containing one ketone group and one carboxylic acid group, for a total of **3 oxygen atoms**.\n    *   A reaction that reduces the oxygen count from 3 to 2 implies the reduction of one of the oxygen-containing functional groups. Strong reducing agents can reduce both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols. The reaction would be: R-C(=O)-COOH + [Reducing Agent] → R-CH(OH)-CH₂(OH). The product, a diol, has **2 oxygen atoms**.\n    *   This indicates that substance X is a powerful reducing agent.\n    *   \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" This points towards common laboratory reducing agents. The most powerful and common ones are complex metal hydrides like Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄) and Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄).\n    *   Since X must contain Deuterium, the likely candidates for X are their deuterated analogs: **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)** or Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄).\n\n4.  **Analyze the Reaction of X with Y:**\n    *   The reaction is: X + Y(liquid) → W(gas) + G(precipitate)\n    *   We know X is likely LiAlD₄ or NaBD₄.\n    *   Gas W has an equal number of neutrons and protons. Let's test some simple gases. Deuterium gas, D₂, consists of two deuterium atoms (each with 1 proton and 1 neutron). The D₂ molecule, therefore, has **2 protons and 2 neutrons**. This fits the description (p=n).\n    *   Let's test the hypothesis that X = LiAlD₄ and the reaction produces D₂ gas. The reaction of a deuteride with a source of D⁺ (like D₂O) would produce D₂ gas. Let's assume the liquid Y is heavy water, D₂O.\n    *   **Reaction Hypothesis:** LiAlD₄ (X) + 4 D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G) + LiOD + 4 D₂ (W)\n    *   Let's check if this fits all the clues:\n        *   **Violent reaction?** Yes, the reaction of LiAlH₄ with water is extremely violent, and the same would be true for LiAlD₄ with D₂O.\n        *   **Gas W (p=n)?** The gas produced is D₂ (2 protons, 2 neutrons). This fits.\n        *   **Precipitate G?** The reaction forms Aluminium deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃. Aluminium hydroxide is a gelatinous precipitate, so Al(OD)₃ would also be a precipitate. This fits.\n        *   **Heating G releases B?** Heating aluminium deuteroxide decomposes it: 2 Al(OD)₃(s) → Al₂O₃(s) + 3 D₂O(g). This releases D₂O, which is substance B. This fits perfectly.\n\n5.  **Conclusion on the Identity of X:** All clues point consistently to **Substance X being Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. The hypothesis with NaBD₄ fails because its reaction products (like sodium borate/deuteroxide) are typically soluble, so no precipitate G would form.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Hydrogen (H, Z=1), Lithium (Li, Z=3), and Aluminium (Al, Z=13).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen (by atomic number).\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminium (by atomic number).\n    *   The problem specifies to sum the masses of all isotopes for an element if multiple instances exist. We will use integer mass numbers (protons + neutrons) for this calculation, as is standard for such problems.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains 4 atoms of the Deuterium isotope (²H). The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n        *   Cumulative mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminium):** The molecule contains 1 atom of Aluminium. The most common isotope is ²⁷Al. The mass number of Aluminium is 27.\n        *   Cumulative mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Total Sum:** The cumulative sum is the sum of these two values.\n        *   Total = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "*   **Step 1: Identify Substance B.** The problem states that the melting point of substance B is \"very close to 277 K\". We convert this temperature to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 K = 3.85 °C. The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C. However, the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope Deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C. This is an excellent match, so we can confidently identify **Substance B as D₂O**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the \"heavier isotope\" and Gas W.** Since B is D₂O, the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned must be **Deuterium (D)**, an isotope of hydrogen with one proton and one neutron. Substance X, therefore, must contain Deuterium. The reaction releases a gas W whose molecule contains an equal number of neutrons and protons. Let's consider Deuterium gas, D₂. Each D atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule therefore has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. The number of protons equals the number of neutrons, so **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the reaction of X with a keto acid.** A keto acid contains both a ketone group and a carboxylic acid group, for a total of 3 oxygen atoms (R-C(=O)-COOH). The problem states that the reaction with substance X results in a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. This implies a reduction reaction where one of the oxygen-containing functional groups is fully reduced. A strong reducing agent can reduce both the ketone and the carboxylic acid to alcohols: R-C(=O)-COOH → R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH. This resulting diol has 2 oxygen atoms. This tells us that **Substance X is a strong reducing agent**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Identify Substance X.** The problem states that X and its \"very close analog\" are used as reagents in organic chemistry. Combining this with the fact that X is a strong reducing agent containing deuterium, we can consider deuterated versions of common strong reducing agents like Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄) or Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄). The deuterated analogs are Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄) and Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄).\n\n*   **Step 5: Synthesize all clues to pinpoint Substance X.**\n    *   The overall reaction is: X + Y(liquid) → D₂(gas) + G(precipitate).\n    *   The violent reaction suggests a highly reactive hydride/deuteride with a protic/deuterated solvent. To produce D₂ gas, the deuteride (X) must react with a source of deuterium ions, such as D₂O. So, **liquid Y is likely D₂O**.\n    *   Let's test the reaction with X = LiAlD₄ and Y = D₂O:\n        `LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4 D₂`\n    *   This reaction is known to be violent. It produces D₂ gas (W). It forms a precipitate, Aluminium Deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, which corresponds to G.\n    *   Finally, heating the precipitate G, Al(OD)₃, would cause it to decompose: `2 Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3 D₂O`. This releases D₂O, which is substance B.\n    *   This scenario fits all the clues perfectly. (The alternative, NaBD₄, is less likely because its reaction products are generally soluble, so no precipitate G would form).\n    *   Therefore, **Substance X is Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n*   **Step 6: Perform the final calculation.** The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X (LiAlD₄). We will use the integer mass numbers for the isotopes involved.\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (in the form of its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The **lightest element** (by atomic number) is Hydrogen. The molecule contains 4 atoms of its isotope, Deuterium (²H), which has a mass number of 2.\n    *   The **heaviest element** (by atomic number) is Aluminium. The molecule contains 1 atom of its most common isotope, ²⁷Al, which has a mass number of 27.\n    *   Cumulative mass of the lightest element's atoms = 4 × (mass number of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Cumulative mass of the heaviest element's atoms = 1 × (mass number of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Total cumulative mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to identify substance X and solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The first critical clue is the melting point of substance B, which is \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   Converting Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of standard water (H₂O) is 0 °C.\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (Deuterium Oxide, D₂O) is 3.82 °C.\n    *   This is an extremely close match, so we can confidently identify **Substance B as D₂O**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Heavier Isotope and Gas W:**\n    *   Since D₂O is produced in the overall process, the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned in the problem must be **Deuterium (D)**, an isotope of Hydrogen with 1 proton and 1 neutron (mass number = 2).\n    *   This means Substance X must be a deuterated compound (it contains deuterium).\n    *   The reaction releases gas W, whose molecules have an equal number of neutrons and protons. Let's test Deuterium gas (D₂). Each D atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has **2 protons and 2 neutrons**. This perfectly fits the description. So, **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n3.  **Use the Organic Chemistry Clue to Determine the Function of X:**\n    *   A keto acid (general structure R-C(=O)-COOH) contains 3 oxygen atoms.\n    *   The reaction with substance X yields a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. This implies a powerful reduction reaction, for example, the reduction of both the ketone and carboxylic acid groups to alcohol groups (R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH), which results in a diol with 2 oxygen atoms.\n    *   This tells us that **Substance X is a strong reducing agent**.\n\n4.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    *   We know X is a strong reducing agent containing Deuterium. The clue that X and \"its very close analog\" are common organic chemistry reagents points towards complex metal hydrides.

To produce D₂ gas from a deuteride, the reactant Y must be a deuterium source, like heavy water (D₂O). So, **liquid Y is D₂O**.\n    *   Consider the reaction with **X = LiAlD₄**:\n        `LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4 D₂`\n    *   This reaction is known to be violent. It produces D₂ gas (W). It also forms Aluminium Deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, which is the analog of the gelatinous precipitate Aluminium Hydroxide, so it fits the description of precipitate G.\n    *   The final clue is that heating G releases B. Heating Aluminium Deuteroxide would cause it to decompose: `2 Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3 D₂O`. This releases D₂O (B).\n    *   All clues consistently point to **Substance X being Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).
