    "Here's my thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The main goal is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 and Planet 2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet depends on the star's properties and the planet's distance from the star. The formula is:\n    T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n    where:\n    *   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   A is the planet's albedo.\n    *   R_star is the star's radius.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** I need to compute the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n    T_eq1 = T_star * (1 - A_1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1))\n    T_eq2 = T_star * (1 - A_2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))\n\n    The problem states that the star is the same for both planets (so T_star and R_star are constant) and that the albedos are the same (A_1 = A_2). Therefore, most terms will cancel out when I take the ratio:\n\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [ T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1)) ] / [ T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2)) ]\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (R_star / (2 * a_1)) * (2 * a_2 / R_star) )\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n\n    So, the problem is now reduced to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes, a_2 / a_1.\n\n4.  **Relate Orbital Distance to Given Information:** The problem provides information from the radial velocity (RV) method: the Doppler shifts (Δλ) caused by each planet. The Doppler shift is related to the star's radial velocity amplitude (K).\n\n    The formula for the radial velocity amplitude (K) for a planet in a circular orbit is:\n    K = (M_p * sin(i)) / sqrt(M_star) * sqrt(G/a)\n    where:\n    *   M_p is the planet's mass.\n    *   M_star is the star's mass.\n    *   `i` is the orbital inclination.\n    *   G is the gravitational constant.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis.\n\n    The problem states that the planets were also detected via the transit method. This implies that their orbits are edge-on from our perspective, so the inclination `i` is approximately 90°, and sin(i) ≈ 1.\n\n    The radial velocity amplitude K is also directly proportional to the Doppler shift:\n    K = c * (Δλ / λ_0)\n    where c is the speed of light. This means K ∝ Δλ.\n\n5.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis (a):** I can rearrange the RV amplitude formula to solve for `a`:\n    K² = (M_p² * G) / (M_star * a)\n    a = (M_p² * G) / (K² * M_star)\n\n6.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a_2 / a_1):** Now I can use the formula for `a` to find the ratio a_2 / a_1. Again, many terms will cancel out (G, M_star).\n    a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_p2² * G) / (K_2² * M_star) ] / [ (M_p1² * G) / (K_1² * M_star) ]\n    a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2² / K_2²) / (M_p1² / K_1²)\n    a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K_1 / K_2)²\n\n7.  **Plug in the Given Values:**\n    *   Planet masses: M_p1 = 7 M_earth, M_p2 = 5 M_earth.\n        So, (M_p2 / M_p1) = 5 / 7.\n    *   Doppler shifts: Δλ_1 = 0.03 Å, Δλ_2 = 0.04 Å.\n        Since K ∝ Δλ, the ratio of amplitudes is (K_1 / K_2) = (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2) = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4.\n\n8.  **Compute the Ratios:**\n    *   First, the ratio of semi-major axes:\n        a_2 / a_1 = (5/7)² * (3/4)² = (25/49) * (9/16) = 225 / 784.\n    *   Now, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures:\n        T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1) = sqrt(225 / 784) = 15 / 28.\n\n9.  **Final Calculation:** Perform the final division to get a decimal value. I will use a python script for precision.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\n# Masses\nM_p1 = 7  # in Earth masses\nM_p2 = 5  # in Earth masses\n\n# Doppler shifts\ndelta_lambda_1 = 0.03  # in Angstroms\ndelta_lambda_2 = 0.04  # in Angstroms\n\n# Ratio of masses\nmass_ratio_2_over_1 = M_p2 / M_p1\n\n# Ratio of RV amplitudes (K is proportional to delta_lambda)\nK_ratio_1_over_2 = delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2\n\n# Calculate the ratio of semi-major axes (a2/a1)\n# a2/a1 = (Mp2/Mp1)^2 * (K1/K2)^2\na_ratio_2_over_1 = (mass_ratio_2_over_1)**2 * (K_ratio_1_over_2)**2\n\n# Calculate the ratio of equilibrium temperatures (T_eq1 / T_eq2)\n# T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2/a1)\nT_ratio_1_over_2 = math.sqrt(a_ratio_2_over_1)\n\nprint(f\"{T_ratio_1_over_2:.2f}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.54\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated value is approximately 0.54, which is closest to option C (~0.53).

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 and Planet 2, which is T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the star's properties and the planet's orbital distance. The formula is:\n    T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n    where:\n    *   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   A is the planet's albedo.\n    *   R_star is the star's radius.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n3.  **Simplify the Ratio:** We need to compute the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2. Since both planets orbit the same star, T_star and R_star are constant. The problem also states that both planets have the same albedo (A). Therefore, these terms will cancel out in the ratio:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1))] / [T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))]\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n    This simplifies the problem to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes, a_2 / a_1.\n\n4.  **Relate Orbital Distance to Radial Velocity Data:** The problem provides radial velocity (RV) data in the form of Doppler shifts (Δλ). The RV semi-amplitude (K) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n    K = (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * v_orb = (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n    K = (M_p * sin(i)) * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))\n    Since the planets were detected by the transit method, their orbits are edge-on to our line of sight, meaning the inclination `i` is approximately 90°, and sin(i) ≈ 1.\n    So, K ≈ M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))\n\n5.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis (a):** We can rearrange the formula to solve for `a`:\n    K² ≈ M_p² * (G / (M_star * a))\n    a ≈ (M_p² * G) / (K² * M_star)\n\n6.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:** Now we can find the ratio a_2 / a_1. The gravitational constant (G) and the star's mass (M_star) are the same for both and will cancel out:\n    a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_p2² * G) / (K_2² * M_star) ] / [ (M_p1² * G) / (K_1² * M_star) ]\n    a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2² / K_2²) * (K_1² / M_p1²)\n    a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K_1 / K_2)²\n\n7.  **Incorporate the Given Values:**\n    *   The ratio of the planet masses is: M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 M_earth / 7 M_earth = 5/7.\n    *   The Doppler shift (Δλ) is proportional to the RV semi-amplitude (K) via the formula K = c * (Δλ / λ_0). Therefore, the ratio of the RV amplitudes is equal to the ratio of their Doppler shifts:\n        K_1 / K_2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3/4.\n\n8.  **Compute the Final Ratios:**\n    *   First, substitute the mass and RV amplitude ratios to find the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n        a_2 / a_1 = (5/7)² * (3/4)² = (25/49) * (9/16) = 225 / 784.\n    *   Next, use this result to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\n        T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1) = sqrt(225 / 784) = 15 / 28.\n\n9.  **Final Calculation:** To compare with the given options, we convert the fraction to a decimal.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures is the square root of the ratio of semi-major axes (a2/a1).\n# T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n# From the derivation, a2/a1 = (M_p2/M_p1)^2 * (K_1/K_2)^2\n# where M_p is planet mass and K is RV semi-amplitude.\n\n# M_p2/M_p1 = 5/7\n# K_1/K_2 = 0.03/0.04 = 3/4\n\n# Calculate a2/a1\na_ratio_2_over_1 = (5/7)**2 * (3/4)**2\n\n# Calculate T_eq1/T_eq2\nT_ratio_1_over_2 = math.sqrt(a_ratio_2_over_1)\n\nprint(f\"{T_ratio_1_over_2:.4f}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.5357\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.5357.

    "The final answer is C. Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the Relevant Physical Laws:**\n    *   The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet depends on its distance (semi-major axis, `a`) from the star: T_eq ∝ 1/√a.\n    *   The radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) induced on the star by a planet in a circular orbit depends on the planet's mass (M_p) and its orbital distance (`a`): K ∝ M_p/√a.\n\n2.  **Combine the Equations to Find a Direct Relationship:**\n    Our goal is to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2. We can see that both expressions involve the term 1/√a. Let's isolate this term in the second equation:\n    From K ∝ M_p/√a, we can write 1/√a ∝ K/M_p.\n\n    Now, substitute this into the first equation:\n    T_eq ∝ 1/√a ∝ K/M_p.\n    This gives us a direct relationship between the equilibrium temperature, the RV semi-amplitude, and the planet's mass.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:**\n    Using the proportionality T_eq ∝ K/M_p, we can write the ratio of the temperatures as:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (K_1 / M_p1) / (K_2 / M_p2)\n    This can be rearranged to:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (K_1 / K_2) * (M_p2 / M_p1)\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ratios from the Given Data:**\n    *   **Mass Ratio (M_p2 / M_p1):**\n        M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n        M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n        M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n\n    *   **RV Amplitude Ratio (K_1 / K_2):**\n        The RV amplitude (K) is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift (Δλ).
