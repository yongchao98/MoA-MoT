    "An electric dipole transition in a hydrogen-like atom is governed by a set of selection rules for the quantum numbers |n, l, m>. The rules are:\n1.  The change in the principal quantum number, Δn, can be any integer. Since this is a decay process (emission of a photon), the energy must decrease, so n must decrease.\n2.  The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, Δl, must be ±1.\n3.  The change in the magnetic quantum number, Δm, must be 0 or ±1.\n\nThe problem describes a two-step decay from the initial state |3,0,0> to the final state |1,0,0>. This is a cascade decay, meaning it proceeds through an intermediate state. Let's call the intermediate state |n', l', m'>.\n\n**Step 1: First Transition (|3,0,0> → |n',l',m'>)**\n\n*   Initial state: |i> = |3, 0, 0>. So, n=3, l=0, m=0.\n*   We apply the selection rules to find the possible intermediate state(s) |n', l', m'>.\n*   **Δl = ±1**: Since the initial l=0, the intermediate state must have l' = 0 ± 1 = 1. (l' cannot be -1).\n*   **Δn**: The principal quantum number must decrease. A transition from n=3 to n'=2 is possible, as is a transition to n'=1. However, a transition to l'=1 requires n'≥2. Thus, the most likely intermediate state will have n'=2.\n*   **Δm = 0, ±1**: Since the initial m=0, the intermediate state can have m' = 0 + (0, ±1) = 0, +1, or -1.\n\nSo, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>.\n\n**Step 2: Second Transition (|n',l',m'> → |1,0,0>)**\n\n*   Final state: |f> = |1, 0, 0>. So, n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0.\n*   Let's check if transitions from our possible intermediate states are allowed.\n    *   From |2,1,-1>: Δl = 0 - 1 = -1 (Allowed). Δm = 0 - (-1) = +1 (Allowed). This path is possible: |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0>.\n    *   From |2,1,0>: Δl = 0 - 1 = -1 (Allowed). Δm = 0 - 0 = 0 (Allowed). This path is possible: |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>.\n    *   From |2,1,1>: Δl = 0 - 1 = -1 (Allowed). Δm = 0 - 1 = -1 (Allowed). This path is possible: |3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0>.\n\nAll three routes are allowed by the selection rules. The question asks for *the* route and its corresponding probability. This means we need to calculate the branching ratios for the first transition.\n\n**Step 3: Calculating the Probability (Branching Ratio)**\n\nThe probability of a particular decay channel is proportional to the square of the transition dipole matrix element, `W ∝ |<f| **r** |i>|^2`. We need to find the relative rates of transition from |3,0,0> to each of the three possible intermediate states: |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>.\n\nThe initial state |3,0,0> (a 3s orbital) is spherically symmetric. In the absence of any external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the atom has no preference for emitting a photon that would leave it in the m'=-1, m'=0, or m'=1 state. The transition rates to these three degenerate states must be equal.\n\nLet W_m' be the rate of transition from |3,0,0> to |2,1,m'>.\nDue to symmetry: `W_{-1} = W_{0} = W_{1}`.\n\nThe total transition rate out of |3,0,0> to the |2,1,m'> manifold is `W_{total} = W_{-1} + W_{0} + W_{1} = 3W_{0}`.\n\nThe probability, or branching ratio, for any one of these specific paths is the rate for that path divided by the total rate.\n*   Probability (for path via |2,1,-1>) = `W_{-1} / W_{total} = W_{0} / (3W_{0}) = 1/3`.\n*   Probability (for path via |2,1,0>) = `W_{0} / W_{total} = W_{0} / (3W_{0}) = 1/3`.\n*   Probability (for path via |2,1,1>) = `W_{1} / W_{total} = W_{0} / (3W_{0}) = 1/3`.\n\nOnce the atom is in an intermediate state, for instance |2,1,0>, it will decay to |1,0,0> with a probability of 1 (as this is the only available dipole decay channel to a lower energy state). Therefore, the overall probability of a specific cascade route is simply the branching ratio of the first step.\n\nNow we check the given options:\nA) |3,0,0>→|2,1,-1>→|1,0,0> and 1/4. (Probability is incorrect, should be 1/3)\nB) |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0> and 1/3. (This matches our calculation)\nC) >→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0> and 2/3. (Probability is incorrect)\nD) |3,0,0>→|2,1,1>→|1,0,0> and 1/4.

    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Process\n\nThe problem describes a two-step radiative decay from an excited state of a hydrogen atom, |3,0,0>, to the ground state, |1,0,0>. This is a \"cascade\" decay, meaning it goes through an intermediate state. The transitions are specified as \"dipole transitions,\" which means they must obey the electric dipole selection rules.\n\n### 2. Electric Dipole Selection Rules\n\nFor a transition from an initial state |n, l, m> to a final state |n', l', m'>, the selection rules are:\n1.  **Δl = l' - l = ±1**: The orbital angular momentum quantum number must change by exactly one unit.\n2.  **Δm = m' - m = 0, ±1**: The magnetic quantum number can change by at most one unit.\n3.  **Δn = n' - n**: The principal quantum number can change by any integer. For a decay process (emission of a photon), energy must be lost, so the final state must have lower energy, meaning n' < n.\n\n### 3. Step 1: First Transition (|3,0,0> → Intermediate State |n',l',m'>)\n\nLet's apply the selection rules to the initial state |i> = |3,0,0> (n=3, l=0, m=0).\n\n*   **Rule for l**: Δl = ±1. Since the initial l=0, the intermediate state must have l' = 1.\n*   **Rule for n**: n' < 3. Also, for a given l', the principal quantum number n' must be at least l'+1. Since l'=1, the minimum possible value for n' is 2. So, the intermediate state will have n'=2.\n*   **Rule for m**: Δm = 0, ±1. Since the initial m=0, the intermediate state can have m' = 0 ± 1 or m' = 0 + 0. This gives possible values of m' = -1, 0, +1.\n\nCombining these results, the possible intermediate states are:\n*   |2,1,-1>\n*   |2,1,0>\n*   |2,1,1>\n\n### 4. Step 2: Second Transition (Intermediate State |n',l',m'> → |1,0,0>)\n\nNow we check if these intermediate states can decay to the final state |f> = |1,0,0> (n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0).\n\n*   **From |2,1,-1>**:\n    *   Δl = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1 (Allowed)\n    *   Δm = m_f - m' = 0 - (-1) = +1 (Allowed)\n    *   This is a valid transition path.\n\n*   **From |2,1,0>**:\n    *   Δl = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1 (Allowed)\n    *   Δm = m_f - m' = 0 - 0 = 0 (Allowed)\n    *   This is a valid transition path.\n\n*   **From |2,1,1>**:\n    *   Δl = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1 (Allowed)\n    *   Δm = m_f - m' = 0 - 1 = -1 (Allowed)\n    *   This is a valid transition path.\n\nAll three routes are physically possible. The options provided in the question list these individual routes.\n\n### 5. Calculating the Probability (Branching Ratio)\n\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific route. This is the branching ratio for the first transition. The probability of a transition is proportional to the square of the transition dipole matrix element, `|<final| **r** |initial>|^2`. We need to compare the probabilities of the three possible first-step transitions:\n1.  |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>\n2.  |3,0,0> → |2,1,0>\n3.  |3,0,0> → |2,1,1>\n\n**Symmetry Argument:**\nThe initial state |3,0,0> (a 3s orbital) is spherically symmetric. In the absence of external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the atom should have no preference for decaying into any particular m' state of the l'=1 subshell. The states |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1> are degenerate in energy. This symmetry implies that the transition rates to these three states must be equal.\n\nLet W_m' be the transition rate to the state |2,1,m'>.\nThen, `W_{-1} = W_{0} = W_{1}`.\n\nThe total transition rate `W_{total}` out of |3,0,0> into the l'=1 manifold is the sum of the individual rates:\n`W_{total} = W_{-1} + W_{0} + W_{1} = 3 * W_{0}`\n\nThe probability (branching ratio) for any one specific path, for example the one via |2,1,0>, is the rate for that path divided by the total rate:\n`P(|2,1,0>) = W_{0} / W_{total} = W_{0} / (3 * W_{0}) = 1/3`.\n\nSimilarly, the probability for the path via |2,1,-1> is 1/3, and the probability for the path via |2,1,1> is also 1/3.\n\nTo confirm this, we can compute the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients associated with the coupling of the atom's angular momentum (l=0) with the photon's angular momentum (l=1) to produce the final atom's angular momentum (l'=1). The square of these coefficients is proportional to the transition probability.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy.physics.quantum.cg import CG\nfrom sympy import N\n\n# The transition is from l=0 to l'=1. This corresponds to adding an angular momentum of j2=1 (from the dipole operator)\n# to the initial angular momentum of j1=0. The final angular momentum is j3=1.\n# We are interested in the probabilities for the different final m3=m' states.\n# The probability is proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient <j1,m1; j2,m2 | j3,m3>\n# Here, j1=0, m1=0, j2=1, j3=1. m2 = m3 = m'.\n\n# For m' = 0\ncg_0 = CG(j1=0, m1=0, j2=1, m2=0, j3=1, m3=0).doit()\nprob_0 = cg_0**2\n\n# For m' = 1\ncg_1 = CG(j1=0, m1=0, j2=1, m2=1, j3=1, m3=1).doit()\nprob_1 = cg_1**2\n\n# For m' = -1\ncg_minus_1 = CG(j1=0, m1=0, j2=1, m2=-1, j3=1, m3=-1).doit()\nprob_minus_1 = cg_minus_1**2\n\n# The probabilities are proportional to these values.\ntotal_proportional_prob = prob_0 + prob_1 + prob_minus_1\n\n# The branching ratio for the path via m'=0 is:\nbranching_ratio_0 = prob_0 / total_proportional_prob\n\nprint(f\"Proportional probability for m'=0: {N(prob_0)}\")\nprint(f\"Proportional probability for m'=1: {N(prob_1)}\")\nprint(f\"Proportional probability for m'=-1: {N(prob_minus_1)}\")\nprint(f\"Branching ratio for the path via m'=0: {N(branching_ratio_0)}\")\n```\n\n### 6. Conclusion\n\nThe code output confirms that the proportional probabilities for transitioning to m'=-1, 0, and +1 are all equal (equal to 1 in this case), and thus the branching ratio for each path is 1/3.\n\nNow let's review the options:\nA) |3,0,0>→|2,1,-1>→|1,0,0> and 1/4. (Probability is incorrect)\nB) |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0> and 1/3. (Route is valid, probability is correct)\nC) >→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0> and 2/3. (Probability is incorrect)\nD) |3,0,0>→|2,1,1>→|1,0,0> and 1/4. (Probability is incorrect)\n\nThe only option that presents a valid decay route with the correct corresponding probability is B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Problem\nThe problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from the excited state |3,0,0> to the ground state |1,0,0>. This decay happens in two steps, and each step is an electric dipole transition. We need to identify a valid decay path and the probability (or branching ratio) for that specific path.\n\n### 2. Electric Dipole Selection Rules\nAn electric dipole transition between an initial state |n, l, m> and a final state |n', l', m'> is only allowed if the following selection rules are met:\n*   **Δl = l' - l = ±1** (The orbital angular momentum quantum number must change by one).\n*   **Δm = m' - m = 0, ±1** (The magnetic quantum number must change by zero or one).\n*   **Δn = n' - n** can be any integer, but for a decay (emission), energy must be lost, so **n' < n**.\n\n### 3. Step 1: The First Transition\nThe atom starts in the initial state **|i> = |3,0,0>**, where n=3, l=0, m=0. Let the intermediate state be **|n', l', m'>**.\n\n*   **Applying the Δl rule:** Since the initial l=0, we must have Δl = +1 (as l cannot be negative). Therefore, the intermediate state must have **l' = 1**.\n*   **Applying the Δn rule:** Since l'=1, the principal quantum number n' must be at least l'+1=2. Also, n' must be less than the initial n=3. The only possible value is **n' = 2**.\n*   **Applying the Δm rule:** Since the initial m=0, the change Δm can be 0, +1, or -1. This means the intermediate state can have **m' = 0, +1, or -1**.\n\nCombining these results, there are three possible intermediate states: **|2,1,-1>**, **|2,1,0>**, and **|2,1,1>**.\n\n### 4. Step 2: The Second Transition\nFrom the intermediate state |2,1,m'>, the atom decays to the final state **|f> = |1,0,0>**. Let's check if this is allowed for all three possible intermediate states.\n\n*   **From |2,1,m'> to |1,0,0>**:\n    *   **Δl = l_final - l_intermediate = 0 - 1 = -1**. This is an allowed change (Δl = ±1).\n    *   **Δm = m_final - m_intermediate = 0 - m'**. For this to be allowed (Δm = 0, ±1), the value of m' must be 0, +1, or -1.\n    *   All three intermediate states (|2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, |2,1,1>) satisfy the Δm selection rule for the transition to |1,0,0>.\n\nTherefore, there are three valid two-step decay routes:\n1.  |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0>\n2.  |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>\n3.  |3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0>\n\n### 5. Calculating the Probability\nThe question asks for the probability of a *specific* route. This is the branching ratio of the first transition. The total probability of decay from |3,0,0> to the |2,1,m'> level is the sum of the probabilities of decaying to each of the three possible m' states.\n\nThe probability of a transition is proportional to the square of the transition matrix element. A key principle of quantum mechanics is that in the absence of an external field, space is isotropic (there is no preferred direction). The initial state |3,0,0> is spherically symmetric. Therefore, there is no reason for the atom to prefer decaying to the m'=-1 state over the m'=0 or m'=1 states. All three transitions are equally likely.\n\nLet the probability of transitioning to |2,1,m'> be P(m').\nDue to symmetry: **P(-1) = P(0) = P(1)**.\n\nSince these are the only three possible outcomes for the first decay step, their probabilities must sum to 1.\nP(total) = P(-1) + P(0) + P(1) = 1\n3 * P(0) = 1\n**P(0) = 1/3**\n\nTherefore, the probability of the specific decay route |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0> is **1/3**. The same probability of 1/3 applies to the other two routes as well.\n\n### 6. Comparing with the Options\nLet's check the given options against our findings:\n*   A) |3,0,0>→|2,1,-1>→|1,0,0> and 1/4. The route is correct, but the probability is wrong.\n*   B) **|3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0> and 1/3**. The route is correct, and the probability is correct.\n*   C) >→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0> and 2/3. The probability is wrong.\n*   D) |3,0,0>→|2,1,1>→|1,0,0> and 1/4. The route is correct, but the probability is wrong.\n\nThe only option that matches our analysis is B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the solution:\n\n### 1. Understand the Physics of the Process\nThe problem describes a two-step decay of a hydrogen atom from the |3,0,0> state to the |1,0,0> state. Each step is an \"electric dipole transition,\" which means the process must obey a specific set of rules known as selection rules.\n\n### 2. State the Electric Dipole Selection Rules\nFor a transition to occur from an initial quantum state |n, l, m> to a final state |n', l', m'>, the following conditions on the quantum numbers must be met:\n*   **Principal Quantum Number (n):** Δn = n' - n can be any integer. For a decay process (emission of a photon), the atom loses energy, so the final principal quantum number must be smaller than the initial one (n' < n).\n*   **Orbital Angular Momentum Quantum Number (l):** Δl = l' - l = ±1. The orbital angular momentum must change by exactly one unit.\n*   **Magnetic Quantum Number (m):** Δm = m' - m = 0, ±1. The magnetic quantum number can change by zero or one unit.\n\n### 3. Analyze the First Transition Step\nThe decay starts from the initial state **|i> = |3,0,0>** (so n=3, l=0, m=0) and goes to an intermediate state **|n', l', m'>**.\n\n*   **Applying the Δl rule:** Since the initial l=0, and Δl must be ±1, the only possibility is that Δl = +1 (as l cannot be negative). This means the intermediate state must have **l' = 1**.\n*   **Applying the Δn rule:** We know n' < n, so n' < 3. Also, a fundamental rule of quantum mechanics is that for a given l, the principal quantum number n must be at least l+1. Since l'=1, the intermediate state must have n' ≥ 2. The only integer that satisfies both n' < 3 and n' ≥ 2 is **n' = 2**.\n*   **Applying the Δm rule:** Since the initial m=0, the change Δm can be 0, +1, or -1. This means the final magnetic quantum number can be m' = m + Δm = 0 + (0, ±1). Therefore, the possible values for the intermediate magnetic quantum number are **m' = -1, 0, or +1**.\n\nCombining these, we find that there are three possible intermediate states: **|2,1,-1>**, **|2,1,0>**, and **|2,1,1>**.\n\n### 4. Analyze the Second Transition Step\nThe second step is the decay from one of the intermediate states |2,1,m'> to the final ground state **|f> = |1,0,0>**. We must check if this transition is allowed.\n\n*   **Applying the Δl rule:** The change is Δl = l_final - l_intermediate = 0 - 1 = -1. This satisfies the Δl=±1 rule.\n*   **Applying the Δm rule:** The change is Δm = m_final - m_intermediate = 0 - m'. For this to be allowed, m' must be 0, +1, or -1. All three possible intermediate states satisfy this condition.\n\nSo, all three potential decay routes are physically allowed by the selection rules.\n1.  |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0>\n2.  |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>\n3.  |3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0>\n\n### 5. Calculate the Probability of a Specific Route\nThe question asks for the probability of a *specific* decay route. This probability is the branching ratio for the first transition step.\n\nThe initial state |3,0,0> is a 3s orbital, which is spherically symmetric. In the absence of any external fields, there is no preferred direction in space (space is isotropic). Therefore, the atom has no preference for which of the three degenerate m' states (|2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, |2,1,1>) it decays into. The probability of transitioning to each of these three states must be equal.\n\nLet P(-1), P(0), and P(1) be the probabilities of transitioning to the m'=-1, m'=0, and m'=1 states, respectively.\nDue to symmetry:\nP(-1) = P(0) = P(1)\n\nSince these are the only possible outcomes for the first decay step, their probabilities must sum to 1:\nP(-1) + P(0) + P(1) = 1\n3 × P(0) = 1\nP(0) = 1/3\n\nTherefore, the probability for the specific route passing through |2,1,0> is 1/3. The same applies to the other two routes.\n\n### 6. Conclusion\nWe compare our result with the given options:\n*   A) Route |3,0,0>→|2,1,-1>→|1,0,0> with probability 1/4. (Incorrect probability)\n*   B) Route |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0> with probability 1/3. (**Correct path and probability**)\n*   C) Route |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0> with probability 2/3. (Incorrect probability)\n*   D) Route |3,0,0>→|2,1,1>→|1,0,0> with probability 1/4.

The only integer satisfying both n' ≥ 2 and n' < 3 is **n' = 2**.\n*   **Rule for m:** Since m=0, the change Δm can be 0, +1, or -1.

All three of our possible intermediate states satisfy this.\n\nTherefore, all three decay paths are valid according to the selection rules.\n\n### 5. Calculating the Probability (Branching Ratio)\nThe question asks for the probability of a *specific* route. This is the branching ratio of the first transition. The initial state |3,0,0⟩ is a 3s orbital, which is spherically symmetric. In the absence of external fields, space is isotropic (has no preferred direction). Therefore, there is no reason for the atom to prefer decaying to one m' state over another. The three possible destination states (|2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩) are degenerate in energy.\n\nThis symmetry implies that the transition rates to these three states must be equal. Let the probability of transitioning to |2,1,m'⟩ be P(m').\nThen, **P(-1) = P(0) = P(1)**.\n\nSince these three paths are the only possible outcomes for the first decay step, their probabilities must sum to 1:\nP_total = P(-1) + P(0) + P(1) = 1\n3 × P(0) = 1\n**P(0) = 1/3**\n\nSo, the probability for the specific route passing through |2,1,0⟩ is 1/3. The same probability of 1/3 applies to the routes passing through |2,1,-1⟩ and |2,1,1⟩.\n\n### 6. Comparing with the Options\nLet's examine the choices provided:\n\n*   **A) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/4:** The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **B) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/3:** The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n*   **C) ⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 2/3:** The probability is incorrect.\n*   **D) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/4:** The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that matches our analysis is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
