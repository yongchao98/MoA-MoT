    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound's chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between molecules. While alcohols also show an O-H stretch, it is typically less broad than that of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Combined with the broad O-H peak, it strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (C=O stretch is typically 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ for acids).\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n    *   **FTIR Conclusion:** The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons attached directly to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation confirms the presence of an alkene functional group, which supports the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** We need to identify a common chemical fragment with this mass-to-charge ratio. Let's calculate the mass of the carboxylic acid fragment, [COOH]⁺.\n        *   Mass = (1 × Carbon) + (2 × Oxygen) + (1 × Hydrogen)\n        *   Mass = (1 × 12) + (2 × 16) + (1 × 1) = 12 + 32 + 1 = 45\n    *   The fragment at m/z = 45 is a very characteristic and diagnostically important fragment for carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Mass Spec Conclusion:** This provides strong evidence for the presence of a carboxylic acid group.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   From the combined spectral data, we have deduced that the unknown compound must contain both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n    *   A carboxylic acid group contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options B (C6H12O) and D (C6H10O), as they only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   We are now left with two possibilities: **A) C6H10O2** and **C) C6H12O2**.\n    *   To differentiate between these two, we can calculate the **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**. The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule.\n    *   The formula for DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)` (where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens; oxygens do not affect the calculation).\n    *   Our structure has a C=O bond (one degree of unsaturation) and a C=C bond (a second degree of unsaturation). Therefore, the correct formula must have a **DoU of at least 2**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the DoU for the remaining options:**\n    *   **For A) C6H10O2:**\n        *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**.\n        *   This DoU of 2 perfectly accounts for one C=O bond and one C=C bond. This formula is consistent with all the spectral evidence.\n    *   **For C) C6H12O2:**\n        *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**.\n        *   A DoU of 1 means there is only one double bond (or one ring) in the molecule. This contradicts our evidence, which points to the presence of two double bonds (one C=O and one C=C).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOnly the chemical formula **C6H10O2** is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data (FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry), as it accounts for the two oxygen atoms of a carboxylic acid and the two degrees of unsaturation required for a carbonyl group and an alkene group.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to deduce the functional groups present in the unknown compound and then determine which of the given chemical formulas is consistent with these findings.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a hallmark feature of the O-H stretching vibration within a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The significant broadening is caused by intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the characteristic range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When seen in conjunction with the broad O-H peak, it strongly confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating that the molecule is an alkene.\n\n*Conclusion from FTIR:* The unknown compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid. This means it must contain both a -COOH group and a C=C bond. The presence of a carboxylic acid group implies the molecule must have **two oxygen atoms**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the NMR spectrum confirms the existence of an alkene group, which supports the conclusion from the FTIR data.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Mass Spectrum**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** We need to identify a common fragment with this mass-to-charge ratio. Let's calculate the mass of the carboxyl fragment, [COOH]⁺:\n    *   Mass = (1 × atomic mass of C) + (2 × atomic mass of O) + (1 × atomic mass of H)\n    *   Mass = (1 × 12) + (2 × 16) + (1 × 1) = 12 + 32 + 1 = 45\n*   A fragment at m/z = 45 is highly diagnostic for a carboxylic acid.\n\n*Conclusion from all spectra:* The compound is definitively an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Molecular Formula Options**\n\nBased on our analysis, the correct formula must satisfy two conditions:\n1.  It must contain **two oxygen atoms** (from the carboxylic acid).\n2.  It must have a sufficient **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)** to account for both the C=O bond and the C=C bond. A double bond counts as one degree of unsaturation. Therefore, we need a total DoU of at least 2.\n\nLet's check the options:\n\n*   **B) C6H12O** and **D) C6H10O**: Both have only one oxygen atom. They can be eliminated.\n*   We are left with **A) C6H10O2** and **C) C6H12O2**.\n\nNow, let's calculate the Degree of Unsaturation for the remaining two options using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **A) C6H10O2:**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = **2**\n    *   This DoU of 2 perfectly accounts for one C=O bond (1 DoU) and one C=C bond (1 DoU). This formula is fully consistent with all the spectroscopic data.\n\n*   **C) C6H12O2:**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = **1**\n    *   This DoU of 1 can only account for the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid. It does not allow for the presence of a C=C bond, which contradicts both the FTIR and 1H NMR data.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical formula that fits all the evidence is C6H10O2.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_dou(formula_str):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for a chemical formula like 'C6H10O2'.\"\"\"\n    import re\n    c_match = re.search(r'C(\\d+)', formula_str)\n    h_match = re.search(r'H(\\d+)', formula_str)\n    \n    C = int(c_match.group(1)) if c_match else 0\n    H = int(h_match.group(1)) if h_match else 0\n    \n    # DoU = C - H/2 + 1 (Oxygens don't affect the calculation)\n    return C - (H / 2) + 1\n\n# From the spectral analysis, we know the compound is a carboxylic acid (2 oxygens) and has an alkene (C=C).\n# This means we need DoU = 2 (1 for C=O, 1 for C=C).\n\noptions = {\n    \"A\": \"C6H10O2\",\n    \"B\": \"C6H12O\",\n    \"C\": \"C6H12O2\",\n    \"D\": \"C6H10O\"\n}\n\nprint(\"Evaluating options based on requirements:\")\nprint(\"Requirement 1: Must have 2 Oxygen atoms (Carboxylic Acid).\")\nprint(\"Requirement 2: Must have a Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) of 2 (for C=O and C=C).\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\nfor option, formula in options.items():\n    has_o2 = \"O2\" in formula\n    dou = calculate_dou(formula)\n    print(f\"Option {option} ({formula}):\")\n    print(f\"  - Meets O2 requirement? {'Yes' if has_o2 else 'No'}\")\n    print(f\"  - Calculated DoU: {dou}\")\n    if has_o2 and dou == 2:\n        print(\"  - Result: This is the correct formula.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"  - Result: This formula is incorrect.\")\n    print(\"\")\n\n```\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   A **very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid (-COOH) due to strong hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A **strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Together with the broad O-H peak, this confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   A **strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), indicating an alkene.\n    *   *Conclusion from FTIR:* The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid. This means it contains **two oxygen atoms**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   The presence of **vinyl-hydrogens** confirms the existence of a C=C double bond, supporting the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   The **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is a classic indicator of a carboxylic acid. The fragment is the carboxyl group itself, [COOH]⁺ (Mass = 12 for C + 2*16 for O + 1 for H = 45).\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Chemical Formula Options:**\n    *   Based on the evidence for a carboxylic acid, the molecule must contain **two oxygen atoms**.

This matches our requirement.\n    *   **For C) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**.

    "This problem requires a systematic interpretation of spectroscopic data to determine the structure and, subsequently, the chemical formula of an unknown compound.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Reasoning**\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature for the O-H stretching vibration of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**.

    "This problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the functional groups present in the unknown compound. This information will then be used to determine which of the given chemical formulas is correct.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Reasoning**\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a highly characteristic feature of the O-H stretching vibration within a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** group.
