Analysis of the FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded system. The broadness is characteristic of carboxylic acids, where molecules form dimers through hydrogen bonding. This region also contains C-H stretching peaks, but the broad O-H signal is the most prominent feature.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position is typical for a carboxylic acid (usually 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four given options are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the choices.\n\n**2. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **No vinyl hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds in the molecule. All four options are saturated compounds, consistent with this observation.\n*   **Splitting Patterns (Multiplicity):** This is the key information to differentiate the isomers. The multiplicity of a proton's signal is determined by the number of adjacent, non-equivalent protons (n) following the n+1 rule. When a proton is coupled to multiple, different groups of protons, the multiplicities multiply.\n    *   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq).** This means a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   One neighboring proton (n=1), which splits the signal into a **d**oublet (1+1=2).\n        *   A group of two neighboring protons (n=2), which splits the signal into a **t**riplet (2+1=3).\n        *   A group of three neighboring protons (n=3), which splits the signal into a **q**uartet (3+1=4).\n    *   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt).** This means a different proton in the molecule is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   One neighboring proton (n=1), which splits the signal into a **d**oublet (1+1=2).\n        *   A group of two neighboring protons (n=2), which splits the signal into a **t**riplet (2+1=3).\n        *   Another, different group of two neighboring protons (n=2), which splits the signal into another **t**riplet (2+1=3).\n\n**3. Evaluation of Each Candidate Structure**\n\nLet's analyze the protons in each molecule to see if they can produce these specific splitting patterns. We will focus on the methine (CH) protons on the main carbon chain, as they are most likely to have such complex coupling. We will assume the condensed formulas represent a linear carbon backbone with the bracketed groups as substituents.\n\n*   **A) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid: (CH₃)₂CH-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-COOH**\n    *   Let's analyze the proton at C3: `–CH(CH₃)–`. It's coupled to the C2-`CH₂` (2H), the C4-`CH` (1H), and its own methyl group `CH₃` (3H). This proton would indeed be a **triplet of doublets of quartets (tdq)** or some permutation like `dqt`. So, this molecule has one of the required signals.\n    *   Let's check for a `dtt` signal (a proton coupled to 1H, 2H, and 2H). No proton in this molecule fits this description.\n    *   *Conclusion: Molecule A has a `dqt` but not a `dtt`.

This would give a `tdt` or `dtt` signal.\n    *   However, there is no proton in the molecule coupled to (1H, 2H, and 3H) to give the `dqt` signal.\n    *   *Conclusion: Molecule D has a `dtt` but not a `dqt`. Incorrect.*\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nOnly the structure corresponding to option B, `CH₃-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-CH₂-COOH`, has two different protons that would produce the two distinct and complex splitting patterns described in the ¹H NMR data (a `dqt` and a `dtt`).\n\n<<<B>>>",

    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to identify the correct compound.\n\n### 1. Analysis of FTIR Spectroscopy Data\n\n*   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic hallmark of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded system. The significant broadening is characteristic of carboxylic acids, which form dimers through hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. A frequency of 1700 cm⁻¹ is typical for the carbonyl group in a saturated carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The data strongly indicate the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. All four provided options are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data confirm the functional group type but do not help distinguish between the isomers.\n\n### 2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in analyzing the splitting patterns (multiplicity) of the signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **No Vinyl Hydrogens:** This tells us the molecule is saturated and contains no C=C double bonds. All four options are saturated, which is consistent with this finding.\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This complex splitting means there is a proton in the molecule that is coupled to three different, non-equivalent sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   A single proton (n=1), which splits the signal into a **d**oublet (n+1 = 2).\n    *   A group of two protons (n=2), which splits the signal into a **t**riplet (n+1 = 3).\n    *   A group of three protons (n=3), which splits the signal into a **q**uartet (n+1 = 4).\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This means a different proton in the molecule is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   A single proton (n=1), which splits the signal into a **d**oublet (n+1 = 2).\n    *   A group of two protons (n=2), which splits the signal into a **t**riplet (n+1 = 3).\n    *   Another, chemically distinct group of two protons (n=2), which splits the signal into another **t**riplet (n+1 = 3).\n\n### 3. Evaluation of Each Candidate Structure\n\nWe must now analyze the protons on the main carbon chain (the methine, or CH, protons) for each option to see if they can produce these specific splitting patterns.\n\n**A) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n*   The proton at C3 is coupled to the CH₂ at C2 (2H), the CH at C4 (1H), and the C3-methyl group (3H). This would produce a **dtq** signal.\n*   However, no proton in this molecule is coupled to one proton, a group of two protons, and another group of two protons. Therefore, it cannot produce the **dtt** signal.\n*   *Conclusion: Incorrect.*\n\n**C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n*   The proton at C3 is coupled to the CH₂ at C4 (2H), the CH at C2 (1H), and the C3-methyl group (3H). This would produce a **dtq** signal.\n*   Similar to option A, there is no proton that would give a **dtt** signal.\n*   *Conclusion: Incorrect.*\n\n**D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n*   The proton at C3 is coupled to the CH₂ at C4 (2H), the CH at C2 (1H), and the CH₂ of its ethyl substituent (2H). This would produce a **dtt** signal.\n*   However, no proton in this molecule is coupled to a group of one, two, and three protons. Therefore, it cannot produce the **dtq** signal.\n*   *Conclusion: Incorrect.*\n\n**B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (This is 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid)**\nLet's analyze the two central methine (CH) protons in this structure.\nLet's label the key protons Hc and Hd:\n`      CH₃`\n`      |`\n`CH₃-CH(c)-CH(d)-(CH₂)-COOH`\n`          |`\n`          CH₂CH₃`\n\n*   **Proton Hc:** This proton is coupled to:\n    1.  The `CH₃` group above it (3H) → gives a **quartet**.\n    2.  The `CH` proton next to it (Hd, 1H) → gives a **doublet**.\n    3.  The `CH₂` of the ethyl group on the same carbon (2H) → gives a **triplet**.\n    The resulting signal for Hc is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This perfectly matches the first signal described.\n\n*   **Proton Hd:** This proton is coupled to:\n    1.  The `CH` proton next to it (Hc, 1H) → gives a **doublet**.\n    2.  The `CH₂` group in the chain towards the acid (2H) → gives a **triplet**.\n    3.  The `CH₂` of the ethyl group on the same carbon (2H) → gives a **triplet**.\n    The resulting signal for Hd is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This perfectly matches the second signal described.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe structure corresponding to option B is the only one that contains two different protons whose environments would produce the two distinct and complex splitting patterns observed in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>"
