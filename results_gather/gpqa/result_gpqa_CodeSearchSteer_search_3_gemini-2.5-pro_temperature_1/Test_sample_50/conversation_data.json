    "The problem asks for the net potential energy of a system where a point charge `q` is placed a distance `d` away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. This is a classic problem in electrostatics that is most readily solved using the method of images.\n\nHere's a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **The Method of Images**: To solve this problem, we can replace the grounded conducting sphere with an \"image charge\", `q'`. This image charge is positioned such that the potential on the surface of the sphere becomes zero, mimicking the effect of the grounded conductor. The image charge `q'` is placed along the line connecting the center of the sphere and the real charge `q`.\n\n2.  **Image Charge and Position**: For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` and its position `b` (from the center) are given by:\n    *   `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   `b = R² / d`\n\n3.  **Calculating Potential Energy**: The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. This work is done against the electric field created by the induced charges on the sphere. The potential created by these induced charges is equivalent to the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n\n    The potential energy `U` of a system of charges can be expressed as `U = (1/2) * q * V`, where `V` is the potential at the location of charge `q` due to all *other* charges in the system. In this case, `V` is the potential at distance `d` from the center, caused by the induced charge on the sphere (which is the same as the potential from the image charge `q'`).\n\n4.  **Potential at the location of q**: The potential `V` at the location of the real charge `q` due to the image charge `q'` is:\n    *   `V = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\n    *   The distance between `q` (at `d`) and `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\n    *   `d - b = d - R²/d = (d² - R²)/d`\n    *   Substituting the expressions for `q'` and `(d-b)`:\n        `V = k * [-q(R/d)] / [(d² - R²)/d]`\n    *   Simplifying this expression gives:\n        `V = -k * q * R / (d² - R²)`\n\n5.  **Final Energy Calculation**: Now we can calculate the total potential energy `U` of the system:\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * V`\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d² - R²)]`\n    *   `U = - (1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\n\n*   A) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\n*   B) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\n*   C) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\n*   D) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nThe derived formula matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
