    "### Analyzing the Statements\n\nThe core of the question is about a dual-catalyst system that performs two functions in a single reactor using only ethylene as a feedstock:\n1.  **Polymerization** of ethylene to form a linear, high-density polyethylene backbone.\n2.  **Oligomerization** of ethylene to form short alpha-olefins (like 1-butene, 1-hexene, 1-octene). These alpha-olefins then act as comonomers and are incorporated into the polyethylene backbone by the polymerization catalyst, creating regular branches. This entire process is often referred to as tandem catalysis.\n\nLet's evaluate each statement based on the search results.\n\n**A) Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.**\nThe search results show that tandem catalysis for producing LLDPE from an ethylene-only feed is a known and industrially relevant concept. Phillips Petroleum Company (now part of ConocoPhillips, a US-based company) was the first to industrialize ethylene trimerization to 1-hexene in 2003. Sasol has also industrialized ethylene tetramerization. These processes generate specific alpha-olefins which are key comonomers for LLDPE. While these are often separate processes, the concept of \"reactor blending\" or using tandem catalysts in a single process has received \"considerable industrial attention\". A patent for a tandem catalytic system producing LLDPE from only ethylene describes the technology. Given that major players like Phillips (a US company) pioneered key parts of this technology and the industrial interest is high, it is plausible that such systems are in industrial use. This statement appears to be correct.\n\n**B) Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.**\nThe \"essential additional reaction step\" is the oligomerization of ethylene. The statement claims aluminum-based activators (like MAO, methylaluminoxane) are ineffective for this. The search results directly contradict this.\n*   Numerous studies show that chromium-based oligomerization catalysts are activated by aluminum-based activators, most commonly methylaluminoxane (MAO) or modified methylaluminoxane (MMAO).\n*   Iron-based catalysts for ethylene oligomerization are also activated by MAO and MMAO.\n*   A study on a tandem system used a chromium trimerization catalyst activated by MAO in conjunction with a zirconium polymerization catalyst.\nTherefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\n**C) One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.**\nGroup VIa (or Group 6) includes Chromium (Cr), Molybdenum (Mo), and Tungsten (W). The search results are rich with examples of chromium-based catalysts being used for the selective oligomerization of ethylene to produce 1-hexene and 1-octene. These are precisely the comonomers needed to introduce branches. For instance, reports mention PNP/Cr(acac)3/MAO catalytic systems exhibiting high activity for selective ethylene oligomerization. A patent also describes catalyst compositions for producing 1-octene using a chromium compound and an aluminum-based activator. Therefore, using a Group 6 metal catalyst for the oligomerization part of the dual system is a well-established and correct concept.\n\n**D) Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.**\nNoble metals include palladium (Pd), platinum (Pt), iridium (Ir), and others. The search results show that noble metals are indeed studied for ethylene oligomerization.\n*   Palladium diphosphine complexes can convert ethylene to branched oligomers.\n*   Palladium and nickel diimine catalysts are well-known for producing a range of polyethylene microstructures, from linear to hyperbranched.\n*   A master's thesis investigated palladium and platinum-based catalysts for ethylene oligomerization.\nThe second part of the statement concerns the cost. While the search results don't provide a direct cost comparison making them prohibitive for this specific tandem application, it is a widely accepted fact in industrial chemistry that noble metals (Pd, Pt, Ir, Rh) are significantly more expensive than base metals like chromium, iron, or titanium, which often makes them economically unviable for high-volume processes like polyethylene production unless their activity and longevity are exceptionally high. The statement that they *can* be used is correct, and the assertion that they are \"too expensive\" is a very strong practical consideration in industrial catalysis. However, compared to statement C, which describes the most common and industrially proven approach (Cr-based catalysts), this statement is more general. Both B and C are very specific chemical statements. B is demonstrably false. C is demonstrably true and central to the technology.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Statement A is plausible and likely correct, as the underlying technologies are industrialized.\n*   Statement B is definitively incorrect. Aluminum-based activators are very common for the oligomerization step.\n*   Statement C is definitively correct. Chromium, a Group 6 metal, is the basis for many of the most successful selective ethylene oligomerization catalysts used to generate comonomers.\n*   Statement D is plausible, as noble metals do show catalytic activity, and their high cost is a known issue.\n\nBetween A and C, statement C is a more fundamental chemical fact about the catalysts involved, which is directly supported by numerous research articles and patents. Statement A is about the industrial implementation, which is also supported but relies on interpreting the scope of \"implemented on an industrial scale\". However, the question asks which statement is *correct*. Statement C describes a chemically accurate and widely practiced method for the key reaction step. Given the options, it is the most robust and verifiably correct statement regarding the chemistry of the system. The scenario describes a scientist designing a system, making a statement about the chemical components (like C) more directly relevant than a statement about industrial economics (like A or D).\n\nFinal check: The senior scientist provides four distinct pieces of information. The prompt asks to identify the correct one.\n- A (Industrial implementation): Plausible.\n- B (Al-activators fail): False.\n- C (Group VIa metals work): True.\n- D (Noble metals work but are expensive): Plausible.\n\nBoth C and A/D seem correct or plausible. However, statement C is a direct, factual statement about the catalytic chemistry that is overwhelmingly supported by the literature as a primary method for the desired transformation. The effectiveness of Group 6 metals, particularly chromium, for selective ethylene oligomerization is a cornerstone of this technology.\n\n<<<C>>>"
