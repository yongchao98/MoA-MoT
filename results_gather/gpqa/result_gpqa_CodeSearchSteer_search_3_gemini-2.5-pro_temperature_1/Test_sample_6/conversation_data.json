    "The physical process described is the annihilation of a high-energy gamma-ray (γ) with a low-energy photon from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) to produce an electron-positron pair (e⁺e⁻). This interaction, γγ → e⁺e⁻, is a threshold process, meaning it only occurs if the combined energy of the two photons in their center-of-mass frame is sufficient to create the rest mass of the electron and positron.\n\nThe key steps to determine the threshold energy for the high-energy gamma-ray are:\n\n1.  **Condition for Pair Production**: The reaction can only happen if the total energy in the center-of-mass frame (√s) is at least the combined rest mass energy of the electron and positron. The rest mass of an electron (mₑ) is approximately 0.511 MeV/c². Therefore, the minimum energy required is 2mₑc².\n\n2.  **Center-of-Mass Energy**: The threshold energy for the incoming gamma-ray is lowest when the collision is head-on. For a head-on collision between a high-energy photon of energy Eᵧ and a CMB photon of energy E_CMB, the square of the center-of-mass energy (s) is given by s = 4 * Eᵧ * E_CMB.\n\n3.  **Threshold Calculation**: By setting the center-of-mass energy equal to the required rest mass energy, we get the condition for the threshold:\n    4 * Eᵧ * E_CMB ≥ (2mₑc²)²\n    This simplifies to:\n    Eᵧ ≥ (mₑc²)² / E_CMB\n\n4.  **Numerical Evaluation**: We can now substitute the given and known values into this equation:\n    *   The rest mass energy of an electron, mₑc², is 0.511 MeV = 0.511 x 10⁶ eV.\n    *   The average energy of a CMB photon, E_CMB, is given as 10⁻³ eV.\n\n    Plugging these values into the formula:\n    Eᵧ ≥ (0.511 x 10⁶ eV)² / (10⁻³ eV)\n    Eᵧ ≥ (0.2611 x 10¹² eV²) / (10⁻³ eV)\n    Eᵧ ≥ 0.2611 x 10¹⁵ eV\n    Eᵧ ≥ 2.611 x 10¹⁴ eV\n\n5.  **Conversion to GeV**: The final step is to convert this energy from electronvolts (eV) to giga-electronvolts (GeV). Since 1 GeV = 10⁹ eV:\n    Eᵧ ≥ (2.611 x 10¹⁴ eV) / (10⁹ eV/GeV)\n    Eᵧ ≥ 2.611 x 10⁵ GeV\n\nThis calculated threshold energy of approximately 2.6 x 10⁵ GeV matches option B. Above this energy, high-energy gamma rays can readily interact with CMB photons, limiting their travel distance and thus their lifetime in the universe.\n\n<<<B>>>"
