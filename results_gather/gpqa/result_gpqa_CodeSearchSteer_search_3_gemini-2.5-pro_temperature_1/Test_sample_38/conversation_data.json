    "To determine the value of \"a\", we must use the normalization condition from quantum mechanics. This principle states that the total probability of finding the particle somewhere in space is 1. The problem specifies that the particles are only found in the region between x=1 and x=3. Therefore, the integral of the probability density function over this interval must be equal to 1.\n\nThe probability density is the square of the modulus of the wave function, |Ψ(x)|².\n\nGiven the wave function:\nΨ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i\n\nFirst, we calculate the probability density |Ψ(x)|²:\nThe wave function has a real part, Re(Ψ) = a / sqrt(1 + x), and an imaginary part, Im(Ψ) = -0.5.\nThe square of the modulus is the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts:\n|Ψ(x)|² = [Re(Ψ)]² + [Im(Ψ)]²\n|Ψ(x)|² = [a / sqrt(1 + x)]² + (-0.5)²\n|Ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\nNext, we apply the normalization condition by integrating the probability density from x=1 to x=3 and setting the result to 1:\n∫¹₃ (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1\n\nWe solve this integral step-by-step:\n1.  Separate the integral:\n    ∫¹₃ [a² / (1 + x)] dx + ∫¹₃ 0.25 dx = 1\n\n2.  Solve the first integral:\n    ∫ [a² / (1 + x)] dx = a² ∫ [1 / (1 + x)] dx = a² * ln(1 + x).\n\n3.  Solve the second integral:\n    ∫ 0.25 dx = 0.25x\n\n4.  Combine and evaluate the definite integral from 1 to 3:\n    [a² * ln(1 + x) + 0.25x] from 1 to 3 = 1\n    (a² * ln(1 + 3) + 0.25 * 3) - (a² * ln(1 + 1) + 0.25 * 1) = 1\n    (a² * ln(4) + 0.75) - (a² * ln(2) + 0.25) = 1\n\n5.  Simplify and solve for 'a':\n    a² * (ln(4) - ln(2)) + 0.5 = 1\n    Using the logarithm property ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B):\n    a² * ln(4/2) = 0.5\n    a² * ln(2) = 0.5\n    a² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n\n6.  Calculate the numerical value:\n    Using the approximation ln(2) ≈ 0.6931:\n    a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931\n    a² ≈ 0.7214\n    a ≈ √0.7214\n    a ≈ 0.8493\n\nThis value is closest to the option 0.85.\n\n<<<B>>>"
