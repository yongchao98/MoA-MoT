    "To identify the mutation most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to find the mutation that would most effectively inactivate the protein synthesized from this gene. This usually involves a \"loss-of-function\" mutation that prevents the formation of a complete, functional protein.\n\n### Analysis of the Gene and Mutations:\n\nFirst, let's analyze the sequence of the intact gene by breaking it into codons (groups of three DNA bases). The gene starts with `ATG`, which is the start codon for protein synthesis.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...TGA-3’`\n    *   Amino Acids: `Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr...Stop`\n\nNow, let's examine each mutant to see how the change affects the resulting amino acid sequence.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...`\n    *   Changes: The codon `CTC` (coding for Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (coding for Tyrosine).\n    *   Type of Mutation: This is a **missense mutation**, where one amino acid is substituted for another. While this could potentially alter the protein's function, it is not guaranteed to eliminate it completely.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...`\n    *   Changes: The codon `CTC` (coding for Leucine) is changed to `TAA`.\n    *   Type of Mutation: `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**, which signals for protein synthesis to stop prematurely. This mutation occurs very early in the gene (at the third codon). The resulting protein would be extremely short (only two amino acids long) and almost certainly non-functional. This type of mutation is a highly effective way to \"knock out\" or inactivate a gene.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...`\n    *   Changes: The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), and further downstream, another change occurs.\n    *   Type of Mutation: This involves multiple **missense mutations**. Like Mutant 1, this changes amino acids but doesn't guarantee a complete loss of function.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...`\n    *   Changes: The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), and `GGT` (Glycine) is changed to `ACT` (Threonine).\n    *   Type of Mutation: This also contains multiple **missense mutations**. Again, this alters the protein, but complete inactivation is less certain than with a nonsense mutation.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nA nonsense mutation that introduces a premature stop codon early in the coding sequence is the most reliable way to produce a truncated and non-functional protein, thereby eliminating its activity. Mutant 2 is the only one with this type of mutation.\n\n<<<A>>>"
