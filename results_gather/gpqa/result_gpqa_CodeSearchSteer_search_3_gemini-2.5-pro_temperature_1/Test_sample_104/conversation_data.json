    "To determine the relative radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same signal as the spotted star, we must first calculate the brightness drop caused by the starspots and then find the exoplanet-to-star radius ratio that would cause an equivalent drop in brightness.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Brightness Drop from Starspots\n\nThe change in brightness is due to the rotation of the star, which alternately shows its unspotted and spotted hemispheres. The flux (brightness) from a surface is proportional to the fourth power of its effective temperature (Teff), according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law (F ∝ T⁴).\n\nThe given values are:\n*   Star's effective temperature (Teff_star) = 6000 K\n*   Spots' temperature (Teff_spots) = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n*   Spot filling factor on one hemisphere (f_spots) = 20% or 0.20\n\nThe maximum flux (F_max) occurs when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer. The flux is proportional to the star's normal temperature raised to the fourth power.\nF_max ∝ T_star⁴\n\nThe minimum flux (F_min) occurs when the spotted hemisphere faces the observer. This hemisphere's flux is a combination of the normal photosphere (80% of the area) and the cooler spots (20% of the area).\nF_min ∝ (1 - f_spots) * T_star⁴ + f_spots * T_spots⁴\n\nThe relative amplitude of the brightness variation is the difference between the maximum and minimum flux, divided by the maximum flux:\n\nAmplitude_spots = (F_max - F_min) / F_max\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nAmplitude_spots = f_spots * (1 - (T_spots / T_star)⁴)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nAmplitude_spots = 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴)\nAmplitude_spots = 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)⁴)\nAmplitude_spots = 0.20 * (1 - 625 / 1296)\nAmplitude_spots = 0.20 * (671 / 1296)\nAmplitude_spots ≈ 0.20 * 0.5177\nAmplitude_spots ≈ 0.1035\n\nSo, the rotational modulation due to the spotted hemisphere causes a brightness drop of about 10.35%.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Equivalent Exoplanet Radius\n\nAn exoplanet transiting its star causes a dip in brightness equal to the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. This is known as the transit depth.\n\nAmplitude_planet = (Area_planet / Area_star) = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\nTo produce the same signal, the planet's transit depth must equal the amplitude from the starspots.\n\n(R_pl / R_star)² = Amplitude_spots\n(R_pl / R_star)² ≈ 0.1035\n\nNow, we solve for the relative radius (R_pl / R_star):\n\nR_pl / R_star = √0.1035\nR_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3217\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) ~0.39\nB) ~0.32\nC) ~0.07\nD) ~0.11\n\nThe calculated value aligns with option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
