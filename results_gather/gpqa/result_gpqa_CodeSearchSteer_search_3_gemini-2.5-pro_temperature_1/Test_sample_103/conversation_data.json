    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Understanding the Radial Velocity (RV) Method:** The RV method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. The star \"wobbles\" as the planet orbits it, causing its light to be slightly redshifted as it moves away from us and blueshifted as it moves towards us. The magnitude of this shift is related to the star's radial velocity.\n\n2.  **Relating Wavelength Shift to Velocity Amplitude:** The observed wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r). The maximum wavelength shift (Δλ_max) corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity curve (K).\n    *   For planet #1, Δλ₁ = 5 milliangstrom.\n    *   For planet #2, Δλ₂ = 7 milliangstrom.\n\n    Since K is directly proportional to Δλ_max, we can find the ratio of the velocity amplitudes:\n    K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4\n\n3.  **The Radial Velocity Amplitude Formula:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the stellar velocity semi-amplitude (K) is given by the formula:\n    K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * [ mₚ sin(i) / M_★^(2/3) ]\n    Where:\n    *   P is the orbital period.\n    *   mₚ is the planet's mass.\n    *   M_★ is the star's mass.\n    *   G is the gravitational constant.\n    *   i is the orbital inclination.\n\n4.  **Applying the Formula to the Problem:** We are given that the star masses are the same (M_★₁ = M_★₂) and the planet masses are similar (mₚ₁ ≈ mₚ₂). In such problems, it is standard to assume that other unstated parameters, like the orbital inclination (i), are also similar for both systems. With these assumptions, all the terms in the formula except the period (P) are constant for both planets.\n\n    This simplifies the relationship to:\n    K ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n5.  **Calculating the Period Ratio:** We can now set up a ratio for the two systems:\n    K₂ / K₁ = (P₂)^(-1/3) / (P₁)^(-1/3) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    From step 2, we know that K₂ / K₁ = 1.4. So we can substitute this value into the equation:\n    1.4 = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    To solve for the ratio of the periods, we first cube both sides of the equation:\n    (1.4)³ = P₁ / P₂\n    1.4 * 1.4 * 1.4 = 1.96 * 1.4 = 2.744\n    So, P₁ / P₂ = 2.744\n\n6.  **Finding the Final Answer:** The question asks for how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which corresponds to the ratio P₂ / P₁. To find this, we take the reciprocal of our previous result:\n    P₂ / P₁ = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644\n\n    This value is approximately 0.36.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) ~ 1.40\nB) ~ 1.96\nC) ~ 0.85\nD) ~ 0.36\n\nThe calculated ratio matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
