    "To identify the unknown organic compound, we need to analyze the provided 1H NMR data and match it to one of the four possible structures: Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, or Trans-butenyl acetate.\n\n### Analysis of the 1H NMR Data:\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** This signal is a singlet integrating to three protons. This is characteristic of the methyl protons of an acetate group (-O-C(=O)-CH₃), which are not coupled to any adjacent protons. All four potential compounds contain an acetate group, so this signal is expected for all of them.\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This signal is a doublet integrating to three protons, which indicates a methyl group (CH₃) coupled to a single proton (-CH). This pattern is consistent with a propenyl group (CH₃-CH=CH-) but not a butenyl group (e.g., CH₃CH₂CH=CH-), which would show more complex signals for an ethyl group. The total proton integration of the spectrum (1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8H) also matches the eight protons of propenyl acetate (C₅H₈O₂), whereas butenyl acetate (C₆H₁₀O₂) has ten protons. Therefore, we can eliminate the butenyl acetate options.\n*   **Vinyl Protons and Stereochemistry:** The signals at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm are in the vinylic region (4.6-5.9 ppm or higher for conjugated or substituted alkenes), corresponding to the protons on the carbon-carbon double bond (-CH=CH-).\n    *   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This is a doublet for one proton with a large coupling constant (J) of 16.0 Hz. Coupling constants between vinylic protons are highly dependent on their stereochemistry. A *trans* relationship typically shows a large coupling constant in the range of 11-18 Hz, while a *cis* relationship shows a smaller one, usually between 6-15 Hz. The observed J value of 16.0 Hz strongly indicates a *trans* configuration for the double bond. The downfield chemical shift is consistent with a vinylic proton attached to an oxygen-bearing carbon (-CH=CH-O-).\n    *   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This signal for one proton is a doublet of quartets. The doublet arises from the coupling with the other vinylic proton (the one at 7.0 ppm). The quartet arises from coupling with the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (the one at 1.6 ppm).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe fragmentation pattern and proton count point to a propenyl acetate structure. The large coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz) of the vinylic proton unequivocally establishes the stereochemistry as *trans*. The complete data set perfectly matches the structure of trans-propenyl acetate:\n\n*   **trans-CH₃(a)-CH(b)=CH(c)-O-C(=O)-CH₃(d)**\n    *   **2.1 ppm (s, 3H):** Acetate methyl protons (d).\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 1H, J=16.0 Hz):** Vinylic proton H(c), coupled to H(b), deshielded by the adjacent oxygen.\n    *   **5.5 ppm (dq, 1H):** Vinylic proton H(b), coupled to H(c) (doublet) and the methyl group (a) (quartet).\n    *   **1.6 ppm (d, 3H):** Methyl protons (a), coupled to H(b).\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<B>>>"
