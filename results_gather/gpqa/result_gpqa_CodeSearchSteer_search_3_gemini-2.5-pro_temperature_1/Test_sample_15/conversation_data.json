    "A compound will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is not superimposable on its mirror image. This typically occurs when a molecule lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion and possesses one or more chiral centers.\n\nHere is an analysis of each compound:\n\n1.  ***(Z)*-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule is an alkene. The atoms of the double bond (C1 and C2) and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane. This plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\n2.  ***(3aR,7aS,E)-*8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name of this complex molecule includes stereochemical descriptors (R, S, and E), which specify a particular stereoisomer. The presence of these descriptors indicates that the molecule has defined chiral centers and is a single enantiomer. A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is optically active.\n\n3.  ***(2R,3S)-*2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers at carbons 2 and 3. However, the substituents on C2 are identical to those on C3 (H, CH3, and COOH). The (2R, 3S) configuration results in a plane of symmetry between these two carbons. Molecules with chiral centers and an internal plane of symmetry are called meso compounds, which are achiral and optically inactive.\n\n4.  ***(2R,3R)-*2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the compound above. In the (2R, 3R) configuration, there is no internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. The molecule is therefore chiral and will exhibit optical activity. Its non-superimposable mirror image is the (2S, 3S) enantiomer.\n\n5.  ***(R)-*cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The name specifies the (R) configuration at carbon 1, which is a chiral center. The four different groups attached to C1 are the hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), and two different carbon paths around the ring (-CH2-CH= and -CH=CH-CH2-). As a specific, single enantiomer of a chiral molecule, it is optically active.\n\n6.  ***(1s,3s,5s)-*cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This notation typically refers to the all-*cis* isomer, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This molecule possesses multiple planes of symmetry (each passing through an OH-bearing carbon and the opposite CH2 group) and a threefold axis of rotation (C3). Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is (Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3. Carbon-3 is attached to four different groups: a hydrogen atom, a methyl group, another methyl group (as part of the isobutyl group), and the cyclopentylcarbonylmethyl group [-CH2C(=O)Cyclopentyl]. Therefore, C3 is a chiral center. The molecule as a whole lacks any plane of symmetry and is chiral. Chiral molecules are capable of exhibiting optical activity.\n\nBased on this analysis, the four compounds that will exhibit optical activity are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one\n\nThus, a total of 4 compounds will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<B>>>"
