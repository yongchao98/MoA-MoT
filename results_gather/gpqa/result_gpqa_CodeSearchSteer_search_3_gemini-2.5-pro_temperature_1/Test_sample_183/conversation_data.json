    "The initial analysis of the reaction options proved challenging, as standard electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) rules do not obviously lead to the desired 1,2,3-trisubstituted product in high yield. Synthesizing such compounds can be complex, often requiring non-obvious strategies like blocking groups or directing group manipulation. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. The key precursor to this ether is likely 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol, which would be converted to the final product via a Williamson ether synthesis (using a base like NaOH and an ethylating agent like EtBr).\n\nLet's re-evaluate the provided options by tracing the intermediates, keeping in mind that one of them must represent a viable, high-yield pathway.\n\n**Analysis of Option D**\n\n*   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 on Benzene:** This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, which produces **tert-butylbenzene**.\n*   **ii) HNO3/H2SO4 on tert-butylbenzene:** This is a nitration reaction. The tert-butyl group is an ortho, para-director. Due to the steric bulk of the tert-butyl group, the major product is the *para* isomer, **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene**. A high-yield synthesis would proceed using this major product.\n*   **iii) Fe/HCl on 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene:** This reaction reduces the nitro group to an amine, yielding **4-tert-butylaniline**.\n*   **iv) HNO3/H2SO4 on 4-tert-butylaniline:** This is the nitration of an aniline derivative. In the strongly acidic conditions of nitration, the amino group is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH3+). The anilinium ion is a deactivating, *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group is an activating, *ortho, para*-director. The directing effects of the two groups are cooperative:\n    *   The -tBu group at position 1 directs ortho, to positions 2 and 6.\n    *   The -NH3+ group at position 4 directs meta, to positions 2 and 6.\n    Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same position (position 2). This results in the high-yield formation of **4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline**.\n*   **v) NaNO2/HCl on 4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline:** This step converts the primary aromatic amine (-NH2) into a diazonium salt. The product is **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenediazonium chloride**.\n*   **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat on the diazonium salt:** Heating an aqueous acidic solution of a diazonium salt replaces the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group. This forms **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol**.\n*   **vii) NaOH/EtBr on 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol:** This is a Williamson ether synthesis. The phenol is deprotonated by NaOH to form a phenoxide, which then acts as a nucleophile to displace the bromide from ethyl bromide (EtBr), forming an ether. The product is **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**.\n\nAt this point, it is clear that this reaction sequence (Option D) produces an isomer of the desired product, not the target molecule 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. There seems to be an issue with all the provided options, as none follow a standard, logical pathway to the target molecule in high yield.\n\nHowever, if we are forced to choose the \"best\" option, we must re-examine the premises. Let's reconsider step (iv) of option D. Perhaps the naming of the final compound is based on the IUPAC priority of the ethoxy group, which would renumber the ring. Let's check the final product from Option D: 1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene. This is a 1,2,4 substitution pattern, which is different from the target's 1,2,3 pattern.\n\nLet's assume there is an error in the question's options and re-evaluate the most plausible synthetic route from scratch, which often involves a blocking group strategy that none of the options correctly represent.\n\nA plausible, though not listed, synthesis might be:\n1.  **t-Butylation:** Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene.\n2.  **Sulfonation:** -> 4-tert-Butylbenzenesulfonic acid (blocks the para position).\n3.  **Nitration:** -> 4-tert-Butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.\n4.  **Reduction of Nitro:** -> 2-Amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n5.  **Removal of Sulfonic Acid Group:** (e.g., via diazotization followed by reduction with H3PO2, not straightforward) to get 3-tert-butylaniline. This is already convoluted.\n\nGiven the discrepancy, let's reconsider the nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline from my initial scratchpad analysis.\n1.  Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene\n2.  Nitration -> *o*-Nitro-tert-butylbenzene (minor isomer, but let's assume it's isolated for this hypothetical path).\n3.  Reduction -> 2-tert-Butylaniline.\n4.  Nitration: If we could somehow force nitration at position 3, we would get 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline.\n5.  Diazotization -> Diazonium salt.\n6.  Hydrolysis -> 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol.\n7.  Etherification -> 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\nThis path is also flawed due to the difficulty of the nitration step (step 4).\n\n**Conclusion based on elimination**\n\n*   Options A and B involve sulfonation steps that lead to incorrect isomers.\n*   Option C starts with nitration, followed by Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline, which is problematic and leads to meta-alkylation, not the required ortho-substitution.\n*   Option D provides a chemically sound sequence of reactions that proceeds via major isomers and cooperative directing effects. However, it leads to the wrong final isomer: 1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene instead of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n\nThere is a strong possibility that there is an error in the question or the provided options, as none of them correctly synthesize the target compound in high yield. However, if a choice must be made, Option D represents the most logical and regiochemically controlled sequence of reactions, even though its final product is incorrectly named or is an isomer of the target. Without a viable alternative, and acknowledging the discrepancy, none of the choices are correct. If this is a multiple-choice question from a source, there may be an error in the source material itself.\n\nSince I must choose from the given options, and none perfectly match, I cannot provide a definitive correct answer. The process of elimination reveals fatal flaws in A, B, and C. Option D is the most synthetically sound pathway, but it leads to the wrong isomer.\n\nGiven the constraints, no option is correct. However, if forced to select the \"most plausible\" chemical sequence despite the incorrect final product, Option D is the strongest contender in terms of regiochemical control. This highlights a likely error in the problem statement.\n\n<<<D>>>"
