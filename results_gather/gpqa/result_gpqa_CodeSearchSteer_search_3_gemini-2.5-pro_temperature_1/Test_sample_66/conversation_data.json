    "The problem asks for the joint probability of measuring the z-components of the orbital angular momentum for two electrons, `L₁z` and `L₂z`, to both be `-ħ`. This corresponds to the individual magnetic quantum numbers being `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1`.\n\nThe two-electron system is in a coupled angular momentum state represented by `|l₁, l₂, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>`. In this state:\n*   `l₁ = 1` and `l₂ = 1` are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for the two electrons (since they are in p-orbitals).\n*   `l = 2` is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the system.\n*   `m = -1` is the total magnetic quantum number, which corresponds to the z-component of the total angular momentum.\n\nA fundamental principle of angular momentum coupling in quantum mechanics is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the z-components of the individual angular momenta. This relationship also holds for their respective quantum numbers:\n\n`m = m₁ + m₂`\n\nIn this specific case, the system is in a state where the total magnetic quantum number `m` is -1. Therefore, any measurement of the individual magnetic quantum numbers `m₁` and `m₂` must result in values that sum to -1.\n\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific measurement outcome where `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1`. For this outcome, the sum would be:\n\n`m₁ + m₂ = -1 + (-1) = -2`\n\nThis result (`-2`) contradicts the known state of the system, where `m = -1`. Because this measurement outcome would violate the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum, it is a physically impossible event.\n\nThe probability of measuring an outcome that is inconsistent with the conservation laws of the system is zero. This can also be seen by considering the expansion of the coupled state into the uncoupled basis states using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The coefficient `<l₁, m₁, l₂, m₂ | l, m>` is only non-zero if `m = m₁ + m₂`. Since `-1 ≠ -1 + (-1)`, the corresponding Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero, and thus the probability, which is the square of this coefficient, is also zero.\n\nTherefore, the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both `L₁z` and `L₂z` as `-ħ` is 0.\n\n<<<A>>>"
