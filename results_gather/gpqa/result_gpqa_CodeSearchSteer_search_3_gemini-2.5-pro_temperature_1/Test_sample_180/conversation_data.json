    "To determine the approximate ratio of neutrino fluxes in the specified energy bands after the hypothetical cessation of the pp-III branch, we must analyze the remaining sources of solar neutrinos in those bands.\n\n### Analysis of Solar Neutrino Sources\n\nThe Sun produces neutrinos through several nuclear reaction pathways, primarily the proton-proton (pp) chain and the CNO cycle.\n\n*   **Proton-Proton (pp) Chain**: This is the main source of the Sun's energy and has three main branches (pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III).\n    *   **pp-I Branch**: Produces low-energy 'pp' neutrinos with a continuous spectrum up to 420 keV. These are below both energy bands in the question.\n    *   **pp-II Branch**: This branch involves the electron capture by Beryllium-7 (`⁷Be`). This reaction is crucial as it produces mono-energetic neutrinos, primarily at **861 keV** (with a smaller line at 384 keV). The 861 keV line falls directly into the second energy band (800-900 keV).\n    *   **pp-III Branch**: This branch begins with the beta decay of Boron-8 (`⁸B`), which produces high-energy neutrinos with a continuous spectrum extending up to about 14-15 MeV. These `⁸B` neutrinos contribute flux across both of the specified energy bands (700-800 keV and 800-900 keV).\n\n*   **CNO Cycle**: This cycle also produces neutrinos, notably from the decay of `¹³N` and `¹⁵O`, which have continuous energy spectra that extend up to 1.20 MeV and 1.73 MeV, respectively. These neutrinos contribute a small amount of flux to both energy bands in question, but their overall flux is significantly lower than that of the main pp-chain neutrinos.\n\n### Impact of the Hypothetical Scenario\n\nThe problem states that the **pp-III branch suddenly stops**. This means the production of `⁸B` neutrinos ceases entirely. All other reactions, including the pp-II branch and the CNO cycle, continue as normal.\n\nLet's examine the remaining neutrino flux in each energy band:\n\n*   **Flux (Band 1: 700-800 keV):**\n    *   The primary contributor to this band under normal conditions is the continuous spectrum of `⁸B` neutrinos.\n    *   With the `⁸B` source removed, the only remaining sources are from the CNO cycle (`¹³N` and `¹⁵O` neutrinos).\n    *   The flux from the CNO cycle in this narrow energy band is very small.\n\n*   **Flux (Band 2: 800-900 keV):**\n    *   Under normal conditions, this band receives contributions from both the continuous `⁸B` spectrum and the very strong, mono-energetic `⁷Be` line at 861 keV.\n    *   With the `⁸B` source removed, the dominant, high-flux `⁷Be` line at 861 keV remains, as it is part of the pp-II branch. There is also a minor contribution from CNO neutrinos.\n\n### Calculating the Flux Ratio\n\nAfter the pp-III branch stops, the ratio becomes:\n\nFlux (Band 1) / Flux (Band 2) ≈ (Flux from CNO) / (Flux from `⁷Be` line)\n\nTo estimate this ratio, we can compare the total fluxes of these sources. The total flux of the `⁷Be` neutrinos (at 861 keV) is approximately 5 x 10⁹ neutrinos/cm²/s. The total flux of the main CNO neutrinos (`¹³N` and `¹⁵O`) combined is roughly 5 x 10⁸ neutrinos/cm²/s.\n\n*   The flux in **Band 2** is almost the entire `⁷Be` line flux, which is a very large number (~5 x 10⁹).\n*   The flux in **Band 1** is only a small fraction of the total CNO flux, as the CNO energy spectrum is spread out over more than 1 MeV.\n\nA reasonable order-of-magnitude estimate would be that the CNO flux in the 100 keV-wide Band 1 is about one-tenth of the total CNO flux. The ratio of the *total* CNO flux to the *total* `⁷Be` flux is about 0.1. Therefore, the ratio of the flux in Band 1 (a fraction of the CNO flux) to the flux in Band 2 (the total `⁷Be` flux) will be roughly another order of magnitude smaller.\n\nRatio ≈ (0.1 * Total CNO Flux) / (Total `⁷Be` Flux) ≈ 0.1 * (5 x 10⁸ / 5 x 10⁹) = 0.1 * 0.1 = **0.01**.\n\nThus, the flux in the 700-800 keV band would be approximately 1% of the flux in the 800-900 keV band.\n\n<<<B>>>"
