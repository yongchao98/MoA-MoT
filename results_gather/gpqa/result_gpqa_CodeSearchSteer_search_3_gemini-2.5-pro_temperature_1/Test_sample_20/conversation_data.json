    "**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\n*   **Benzoquinone:** For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it typically needs a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an alpha-hydrogen). In p-benzoquinone, the carbons adjacent to the two carbonyl groups are part of a double bond and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached. Therefore, benzoquinone does not have the necessary alpha-hydrogens to undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has hydrogen atoms on the carbons located between the carbonyl groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6). These alpha-hydrogens are readily removed, allowing the compound to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. In fact, it exists in equilibrium with its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). The enol form is aromatic and, therefore, particularly stable.\n\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is a chiral center - a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. In methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃), the second carbon atom is bonded to a hydrogen (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and an ester group (-COOCH₃). Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center. Therefore, the molecule is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism, existing as D and L isomers.\n\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond in a *trans* configuration. It does not possess a chiral center. Due to its planar structure and a plane of symmetry, it is achiral and cannot exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.\n\nCombining these findings, the compound that does not show tautomerism is benzoquinone (A), and the one that shows optical isomerism is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (B).\n\n<<<D>>>"
