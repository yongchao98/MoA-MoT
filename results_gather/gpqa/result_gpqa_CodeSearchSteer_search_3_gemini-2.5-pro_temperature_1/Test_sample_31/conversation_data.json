    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the energy required.\n\n### 1. Identify the Nucleus and its Properties\nThe nucleus is specified as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons.\n*   The atomic number of Lithium (number of protons, Z) is 3.\n*   The number of neutrons (N) is given as 3.\n*   The mass number (A) is the sum of protons and neutrons, so A = 3 + 3 = 6.\nThe nucleus is therefore Lithium-6 ($^6$Li).\n\n### 2. Determine the Rest Mass of the Lithium-6 Nucleus\nThe problem requires the energy of the nucleus, so we need its rest mass. The mass of a $^6$Li *atom* is about 6.015122 atomic mass units (amu). However, we must use the mass of the *nucleus*, which means subtracting the mass of its electrons.\n\nA more precise method is to calculate the nuclear mass from its constituent protons and neutrons and then subtract the binding energy. An even better approach is to use a tabulated value for the nuclear binding energy per nucleon.\n\nThe binding energy per nucleon for $^6$Li is 5.332 MeV/nucleon. Since there are 6 nucleons (3 protons and 3 neutrons), the total binding energy is:\nTotal Binding Energy = 6 nucleons * 5.332 MeV/nucleon = 31.992 MeV\n\nNow, we calculate the total mass of the individual, unbound nucleons:\n*   Mass of a proton ≈ 938.272 MeV/c²\n*   Mass of a neutron ≈ 939.565 MeV/c²\n\nTotal mass of 3 protons = 3 * 938.272 MeV/c² = 2814.816 MeV/c²\nTotal mass of 3 neutrons = 3 * 939.565 MeV/c² = 2818.695 MeV/c²\nSum of constituent masses = 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV/c²\n\nThe rest mass of the $^6$Li nucleus is the sum of the masses of its parts minus the binding energy that holds them together.\nRest Mass ($m_0$) = (Sum of constituent masses) - (Total Binding Energy / c²)\nRest Mass ($m_0$) = 5633.511 MeV/c² - 31.992 MeV/c² = 5601.519 MeV/c²\n\nSo, the rest energy ($E_0 = m_0c²$) of the $^6$Li nucleus is **5601.519 MeV**.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)\nThe nucleus travels at a speed (v) of 0.96c. The Lorentz factor is calculated as:\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\nγ = 1 / √(1 - (0.96c)²/c²)\nγ = 1 / √(1 - 0.9216)\nγ = 1 / √(0.0784)\nγ = 1 / 0.28\nγ ≈ 3.57142857\n\n### 4. Calculate the Total and Kinetic Energy\nThe \"energy of the collider\" refers to the kinetic energy (K) it imparts to the nucleus. The kinetic energy is the difference between the total relativistic energy (E) and the rest energy ($E_0$).\n\nK = E - E₀ = (γ - 1) * E₀\nK = (3.57142857 - 1) * 5601.519 MeV\nK = 2.57142857 * 5601.519 MeV\nK ≈ 14403.92 MeV\n\n### 5. Convert to Giga-electron Volts (GeV)\nThe options are given in GeV. To convert from MeV to GeV, we divide by 1000.\nK = 14403.92 MeV / 1000\nK ≈ 14.404 GeV\n\nThis calculated value does not match any of the options provided. Let's re-evaluate the premise. The \"energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)\" often refers to the energy **per nucleon**. Let's calculate this value.\n\n### 6. Calculate the Kinetic Energy per Nucleon\nThe $^6$Li nucleus has 6 nucleons.\nKinetic Energy per Nucleon = Total Kinetic Energy / Number of Nucleons\nKinetic Energy per Nucleon = 14.404 GeV / 6 nucleons\nKinetic Energy per Nucleon ≈ 2.4007 GeV/nucleon\n\nThis also does not match the options. Let's reconsider the definition of \"energy\". Sometimes, it can refer to the total energy (E = γE₀), not just the kinetic energy.\n\n### 7. Recalculate Using Total Energy (E)\nTotal Energy (E) = γ * E₀\nE = 3.57142857 * 5601.519 MeV\nE ≈ 20005.44 MeV\nE ≈ 20.005 GeV\n\nThis value is very close to option C.\n\nLet's assume the question is asking for the total energy of the nucleus.\n\nTotal Energy = 20.005 GeV. This is approximately 20.132 GeV. The small discrepancy might arise from using slightly different values for the masses of the proton and neutron or a more precise value for the binding energy of Lithium-6. For instance, some sources list the atomic mass of Li-6 as 6.015122 u. Let's try the calculation with this value.\n*   1 u = 931.5 MeV/c²\n*   Mass of 3 electrons = 3 * 0.511 MeV/c² = 1.533 MeV/c²\n\nRest Mass of $^6$Li atom = 6.015122 u * 931.5 MeV/u = 5603.08 MeV\nRest Mass of $^6$Li nucleus = 5603.08 MeV - 1.533 MeV = 5601.547 MeV\n\nTotal Energy (E) = γ * E₀\nE = 3.57142857 * 5601.547 MeV\nE ≈ 20005.52 MeV\nE ≈ 20.006 GeV\n\nThis result is still closest to 20.132 GeV. Let's solve backwards from option C.\n\nIf Total Energy E = 20.132 GeV = 20132 MeV, then:\nE₀ = E / γ = 20132 MeV / 3.57142857 ≈ 5636.96 MeV\nThis would imply a rest mass for the $^6$Li nucleus of about 5637 MeV/c², which corresponds to the approximate sum of the masses of 3 protons and 3 neutrons *without* subtracting the binding energy (5633.5 MeV/c²). It seems the question intends for the calculation to be done this way.\n\nLet's proceed assuming the binding energy is ignored, which is a common simplification in such problems.\nRest Energy E₀ ≈ (3 * m_p + 3 * m_n) * c²\nE₀ ≈ (3 * 938.272 MeV + 3 * 939.565 MeV)\nE₀ ≈ 2814.816 MeV + 2818.695 MeV\nE₀ ≈ 5633.511 MeV\n\nTotal Energy E = γ * E₀\nE = 3.57142857 * 5633.511 MeV\nE ≈ 20119.68 MeV\nE ≈ 20.120 GeV\n\nThis value is extremely close to option C.\n\nFinal check of the calculation:\nE = (1 / √(1 - 0.96²)) * (3 * 938.272 + 3 * 939.565) MeV\nE = (3.57142857) * (5633.511) MeV\nE ≈ 20119.68 MeV ≈ 20.120 GeV\n\nGiven the options, 20.132 GeV is the intended answer, with the small difference attributable to the precise mass values used for protons and neutrons.\n\n<<<C>>>"
