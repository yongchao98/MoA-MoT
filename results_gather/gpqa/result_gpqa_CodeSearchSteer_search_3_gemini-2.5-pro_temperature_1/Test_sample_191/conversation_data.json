    "Here is a step-by-by-step derivation for the electric field at point P.\n\n1.  **Charge Induction:** The positive charge `+q` placed inside the cavity of the uncharged conductor will attract free electrons from the conductor. These electrons will accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity, inducing a net charge of `-q` on this inner surface.\n\n2.  **Charge on the Outer Surface:** Since the conductor was initially neutral, to maintain its overall charge neutrality, a charge of `+q` must appear elsewhere. This positive charge will move to the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A fundamental property of conductors is electrostatic shielding. The charges on the outer surface of the conductor are unaffected by the arrangement of charges inside the cavity. Due to the spherical symmetry of the outer conductor, the induced positive charge `+q` will distribute itself *uniformly* over the outer surface.\n\n4.  **Electric Field Outside the Conductor:** For any point outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution, the electric field is identical to that of a point charge with the same total charge, located at the center of the sphere (by Shell Theorem or Gauss's Law).\n\n5.  **Calculation:** In this case, the electric field at the external point P is created solely by the `+q` charge distributed uniformly on the outer surface of the conductor. Therefore, the field is equivalent to that of a point charge `+q` located at the center of the spherical conductor. The distance from the center of the conductor to point P is given as `L`.\n\nUsing Coulomb's law, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is:\n\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThe information about the cavity's radius `r`, its off-center position `s`, the distance `l`, and the angle `Î¸` is irrelevant for calculating the electric field outside the conductor due to the shielding effect.\n\n<<<D>>>"
