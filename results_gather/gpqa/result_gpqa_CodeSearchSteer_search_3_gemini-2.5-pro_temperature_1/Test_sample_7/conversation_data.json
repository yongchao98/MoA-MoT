  "question": "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s).

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the experimental results to determine the interactions between genes G1, G2, and G3.\n\n### Analysis of Single Mutants\n*   **g1 mutant (75% resistance):** The loss of G1 function causes a partial reduction in resistance (25% loss). This indicates G1 plays a role in the plant's defense.\n*   **g3 mutant (50% resistance):** The loss of G3 function results in a more significant reduction in resistance (50% loss) than the g1 mutant. G3 is also clearly involved in the defense mechanism.\n*   **g2 mutant (0% resistance):** The loss of G2 function completely eliminates the plant's resistance. This is the most severe phenotype, suggesting G2 has a critical and essential role in the resistance pathway.\n\n### Analysis of Double Mutants\n*   **g1g2, g2g3, and g1g3 interactions:** The study of double mutants is key to understanding how genes function relative to one another.\n*   **g1g2 (0% resistance) and g2g3 (0% resistance):** In both cases, the phenotype of the double mutant is identical to the phenotype of the `g2` single mutant. This phenomenon is called **epistasis**, where the phenotype of one gene mutation (in this case, `g2`) masks the phenotype of another (`g1` or `g3`). This strongly suggests that G2 acts upstream of both G1 and G3 in the same pathway. A common biological explanation for this is that G2 is a transcription factor required to activate the expression of G1 and G3. If G2 is knocked out, neither G1 nor G3 can be produced, leading to a complete loss of resistance, regardless of whether the G1 or G3 genes themselves are functional.\n*   **g1g3 (10% resistance):** The phenotype of the `g1g3` double mutant is much more severe than that of either single mutant (`g1` at 75% or `g3` at 50%). This type of genetic interaction, where the double mutant shows a more severe phenotype than the combination of the individual effects, is known as a negative or synergistic interaction. It often indicates that the two genes function in parallel pathways or have redundant functions. In this case, G1 and G3 likely perform similar or complementary roles, and the plant can partially cope with the loss of one but not both. This relationship is best described as **gene redundancy**.\n\n### Evaluating the Options\n*   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:**\n    *   *G2 is a transcription factor:* This aligns perfectly with G2 being epistatic to both G1 and G3.\n    *   *G1 and G3 show gene redundancy:* This correctly describes the synergistic effect seen in the `g1g3` double mutant.\n    *   *G1 is epistatic towards G3:* This part is incorrect. In the `g1g3` mutant, a new, more severe phenotype appears, rather than one mutant's phenotype masking the other.\n\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** The experiment only measures one trait (disease resistance), so no conclusion can be drawn about pleiotropy (a single gene affecting multiple traits). This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1:** G2, not G1, is the gene that is epistatic to the others, making it the better candidate for the upstream transcription factor. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1:** We cannot determine if they share a promoter from this data. Also, G3 is not epistatic to G1. This option is incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the analysis, the most accurate conclusions are that G2 is an upstream regulator (like a transcription factor) that is epistatic to G1 and G3, and that G1 and G3 exhibit gene redundancy. Option A contains both of these correct conclusions. Despite the final clause (\"G1 is epistatic towards G3\") being inconsistent with the data, the other two statements in option A are strongly supported and are the best description of the genetic interactions among the given choices.\n\n<<<A>>>"
