    "To determine the time experienced by the astronaut, we must use the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\n### 1. Distance and Time in Earth's Frame of Reference\n\nFirst, we need the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud. According to astronomical observations, the distance is approximately 163,000 light-years.\n\nNext, we calculate the time it would take to travel this distance at the given speed from an observer's perspective on Earth.\n\n*   **Distance (d):** 163,000 light-years\n*   **Speed (v):** 0.99999987 * c (where c is the speed of light)\n\nThe time (t) in Earth's reference frame is:\nt = Distance / Speed = 163,000 light-years / (0.99999987 * c)\nSince a light-year is the distance light travels in one year (1 ly = c * 1 year), the 'c' cancels out.\nt ≈ 163,000.21 years (as measured from Earth)\n\n### 2. Time Dilation Calculation\n\nTime dilation describes how time passes slower for a moving object relative to a stationary observer. The formula for time dilation involves the Lorentz factor (γ).\n\nThe Lorentz factor is calculated as:\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nGiven v = 0.99999987 * c, we get:\nγ = 1 / √(1 - (0.99999987c)²/c²)\nγ = 1 / √(1 - 0.99999974)\nγ = 1 / √0.00000026\nγ ≈ 1 / 0.0005099\nγ ≈ 1961.16\n\nNow, we can find the time experienced by the astronaut (t'), which is the proper time.\nt' = t / γ\nt' = 163,000.21 years / 1961.16\nt' ≈ 83.11 years\n\n### 3. Conclusion\n\nThe journey would take approximately 83.11 years from the astronaut's point of view. The astronaut's age upon arrival would be 22 + 83.11 = 105.11 years. Since their average lifetime is 150 years, the astronaut would survive the trip, making option D incorrect.\n\nComparing our calculated time of ~83.11 years to the given options:\nA) 72 years\nB) 81 years\nC) 77 years\n\nThe closest answer is 81 years. The slight difference is likely due to the use of a slightly different value for the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud in the problem's source (e.g., using a distance of approximately 159,000 light-years would yield an answer of roughly 81 years). Based on the available choices, 81 years is the most plausible answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
