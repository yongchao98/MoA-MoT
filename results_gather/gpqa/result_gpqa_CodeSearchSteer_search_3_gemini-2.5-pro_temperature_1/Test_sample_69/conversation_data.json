    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Analyze Clue 3: The Hydrolysis Reaction**\n    *   `C + H₂O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)`\n    *   The fact that product C hydrolyzes to reform the initial reactant A strongly suggests that A is a chemical element that forms the core of compound C.\n    *   The formation of two different acids, one strong and one weak, from a compound made of only A and B, is a classic indicator of the hydrolysis of a compound containing two different non-metals, often halogens. A very common example of a strong/weak acid pair is hydrochloric acid (HCl, strong) and hydrofluoric acid (HF, weak). This implies that compound C contains both chlorine and fluorine.\n\n2.  **Analyze Clue 1 & Identify B:**\n    *   `A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (bright red product)`\n    *   If C contains chlorine and fluorine, then gas B must be a chlorine-fluorine compound (an interhalogen). The most common gaseous chlorine fluorides are ClF and ClF₃. Let's consider **Chlorine trifluoride (ClF₃)** as a candidate for gas B, as it is a powerful fluorinating and chlorinating agent.\n\n3.  **Analyze Clue 4 & Identify D and H:**\n    *   `D (gas) + B (gas) → H (solvent) (1:1 ratio)`\n    *   If B is ClF₃, the reaction is `D + ClF₃ → H (solvent)`. A known reaction that fits this description involves arsenic trifluoride (AsF₃), which can be a gas (boiling point 62.8 °C).\n    *   The reaction is: `AsF₃ + ClF₃ → [ClF₂]⁺[AsF₄]⁻`. This product is an ionic liquid, which can act as a solvent. Thus, we can tentatively identify **D = AsF₃** and **H = [ClF₂]⁺[AsF₄]⁻**.\n\n4.  **Identify A and C:**\n    *   With B = ClF₃, Reaction 1 is `A(s) + 8 ClF₃(g) → C (bright red)`. This reaction involves a solid element reacting with a large amount of a powerful halogenating agent. A plausible candidate for A is **Iodine (I₂)**, a solid element.\n    *   Iodine reacts with ClF₃ to form various complex interhalogen compounds, which are often brightly colored (red or yellow). The exact identity of C is complex and could be a mixture or a salt-like compound such as `[I(ClF₂)₂]⁺[I(ClF₄)₂]⁻`, but for the purpose of the puzzle, we can identify C as a complex formed from iodine, chlorine, and fluorine. The hydrolysis of such a compound would yield I₂ (A), HCl (F), and HF (G), fitting Clue 3.\n\n5.  **Identify E and its Molecular Symmetry:**\n    *   This is the final step. The reaction is `C + 2 D → E (extremely hazardous)`.\n    *   Substituting our identified compounds: `C (Iodine/Chlorine/Fluorine complex) + 2 AsF₃ → E`.\n    *   The reaction between a powerful oxidizing/halogenating agent like C and arsenic trifluoride would be vigorous and produce hazardous materials. The product E would likely be an arsenic halide. A very stable and extremely hazardous product from such a reaction is **Arsenic pentafluoride (AsF₅)**.\n    *   Now, we must determine the molecular geometry and symmetry point group of AsF₅. According to VSEPR theory, AsF₅ has a central arsenic atom bonded to five fluorine atoms with no lone pairs. This results in a **trigonal bipyramidal** geometry.\n    *   The point group for a trigonal bipyramidal molecule like AsF₅ is **D3h**.\n\nThis result (D3h) is not among the options (A) D4h, B) C2, C) D∞h, D) C2v). This indicates that there is likely a different, perhaps more common, set of reactants intended by the puzzle.\n\nLet's re-evaluate based on the options, focusing on finding a plausible identity for E.\n\n*   **COCl₂ (Phosgene)** is an extremely hazardous gas with **C₂ᵥ symmetry** (Option D).\n    *   Let's test this path. If E is not formed in Reaction 4, let's assume `H = COCl₂`. This means `D + B -> COCl₂`. The synthesis of phosgene is `CO + Cl₂ -> COCl₂`. So, let's set **B = CO** and **D = Cl₂**.\n    *   Reaction 1: `A(s) + 8 CO(g) -> C(bright red)`. This is a classic metal carbonyl formation. A well-known example is `2Co(s) + 8CO(g) -> Co₂(CO)₈`. So **A = Co** and **C = Co₂(CO)₈**, which is described as reddish-orange.\n    *   Reaction 2: `C + 2 D -> E`. This becomes `Co₂(CO)₈ + 2 Cl₂ -> E`. This reaction is known to produce cobalt(II) chloride and carbon monoxide, but it can also produce phosgene under certain conditions, though the stoichiometry is complex.\n    *   Reaction 3: `Co₂(CO)₈ + H₂O -> Co + F + G`. This is the major inconsistency. The hydrolysis of cobalt carbonyl does not typically produce a strong and a weak acid.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, the most logical approach is to recognize which of the provided symmetry groups most commonly corresponds to simple, \"extremely hazardous\" molecules as described.\n*   **A) D4h:** Example: XeF₄ (Hazardous, but the reaction path is inconsistent).\n*   **B) C2:** Represents a broad class of chiral molecules.\n*   **C) D∞h:** Examples: CO₂, N₂ (Not typically considered \"extremely hazardous\" in this context).\n*   **D) C2v:** Examples: O₃ (Ozone), SO₂, NO₂, H₂S, **COCl₂ (Phosgene)**. This group contains several common and extremely hazardous substances.\n\nThe molecule **Ozone (O₃)** is extremely hazardous and has **C₂ᵥ** symmetry. It fits the description of E and is a simple, common molecule. While building a fully consistent narrative for all reactants (A, B, C, D, H) is difficult due to the puzzle's ambiguity, ozone is a very strong candidate for E. Its symmetry group is C₂ᵥ.\n\nTherefore, based on the common properties of hazardous materials and their molecular structures, C₂ᵥ is the most plausible answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
