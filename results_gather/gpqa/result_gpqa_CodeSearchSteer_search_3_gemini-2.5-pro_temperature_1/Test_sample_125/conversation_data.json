    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the products from each reaction and how they will behave during the chromatographic separation.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral ketone with a single stereocenter at the C5 position.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone at the C3 position is reduced to an alcohol by Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH). This reaction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** Since the starting material is enantiomerically pure and a new stereocenter is formed, the two resulting products will be diastereomers: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Summary for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups at C2 and C4 are reduced to alcohols by sodium borohydride (NaBH4). This creates two stereocenters in the product, pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Products:** The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), and (2R, 4S).\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) forms are non-superimposable mirror images, making them a pair of enantiomers. Since the starting material and reagent are achiral, they will be produced in a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) form has an internal plane of symmetry, making it an achiral meso compound.\n*   **Summary for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomers are formed: one meso compound and a pair of enantiomers.\n\n### **Combined Product Mixture**\n\nAfter combining the products from both reactions, the mixture contains a total of **five** different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Diastereomer A)\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Diastereomer B)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (Enantiomer C)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Enantiomer D)\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (Meso E)\n\n### **Chromatographic Analysis**\n\n**1. Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity but cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   Diastereomers A and B have different physical properties and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   Enantiomers C and D are indistinguishable on an achiral column and will elute together as **one peak**.\n*   Meso compound E is a diastereomer of C and D, has different physical properties, and will elute as a separate, **one peak**.\nThe products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are structurally distinct molecules with different polarities and will be well separated from each other.\nTherefore, the total number of peaks observed will be 2 (from Reaction I) + 1 (for the enantiomeric pair) + 1 (for the meso compound) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**2. Chiral HPLC**\nA chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase that can distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   Diastereomers A and B will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   Enantiomers C and D will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase and will be resolved into **two separate peaks**.\n*   Meso compound E, being a distinct achiral molecule, will produce **one peak**.\nAs a result, all five compounds in the mixture will be separated from one another.\nTherefore, the total number of peaks observed will be 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from the resolved enantiomers) + 1 (for the meso compound) = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe chemist will observe 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<B>>>"
