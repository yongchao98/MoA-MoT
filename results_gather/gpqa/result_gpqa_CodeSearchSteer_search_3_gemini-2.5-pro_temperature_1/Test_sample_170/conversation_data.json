    "To arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield from electrophilic bromination, we must first classify the substituents on the benzene ring and then analyze their directing effects and the steric hindrance they impose.\n\n### **Step 1: Classify the Substituents**\n\nFirst, we classify the substituents as either ortho-, para-directing or meta-directing. This determines where the bromine atom is most likely to substitute.\n\n*   **Ortho-, para-directing groups:** These groups activate or weakly deactivate the ring and direct incoming electrophiles to the ortho (positions 2 and 6) and para (position 4) positions.\n    *   **-CH3 (in Toluene, 1):** Activating, ortho-, para-directing.\n    *   **-C2H5 (in Ethylbenzene, 5):** Activating, ortho-, para-directing.\n    *   **-Cl (in Chlorobenzene, 3):** Deactivating, but ortho-, para-directing.\n*   **Meta-directing groups:** These groups deactivate the ring and direct incoming electrophiles to the meta (positions 3 and 5) positions.\n    *   **-NO2 (in Nitrobenzene, 4):** Strongly deactivating, meta-directing.\n    *   **-COOH (in Benzoic acid, 6):** Deactivating, meta-directing.\n    *   **-COOC2H5 (in Ethyl benzoate, 2):** Deactivating, meta-directing.\n\n### **Step 2: Compare Para-Isomer Yields Within Each Group**\n\n**Meta-Directing Substances (Lowest Para Yield)**\n\nSubstances with meta-directing groups will produce very low yields of the para-isomer. Bromination of these compounds predominantly yields the meta-product. The small amount of para-isomer formed is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent.\n\n*   **Nitrobenzene (4, -NO2):** The nitro group is one of the strongest deactivating groups. Bromination yields almost exclusively the meta-isomer, with only trace amounts of the para-isomer (around 1% or less).\n*   **Benzoic acid (6, -COOH) and Ethyl benzoate (2, -COOC2H5):** These are also strong deactivators, though generally less so than the nitro group. They will produce slightly more para-isomer than nitrobenzene but still in very small quantities. For similar reactions like nitration, ethyl benzoate yields around 5% para-isomer. Comparing -COOH and -COOC2H5, they have similar deactivating strengths, but the trend generally places -COOH as slightly more deactivating than -COOR.\n\nThus, for the meta-directors, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is:\n**Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)**\n\n**Ortho-, Para-Directing Substances (Highest Para Yield)**\n\nSubstances with ortho-, para-directing groups will produce significant amounts of the para-isomer. The ratio of the para to ortho isomer is primarily governed by two factors: electronics and sterics.\n\n*   **-Cl (Chlorobenzene, 3):** Halogens are a unique case. While they are deactivating overall due to their strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I), they direct ortho-para because of their electron-donating resonance effect (+R). The inductive effect deactivates the adjacent ortho positions more strongly than the more distant para position. This leads to a strong preference for para substitution. For instance, nitration of chlorobenzene gives about 70% para product. For bromination, the para-isomer is also heavily favored, often around 89%.\n*   **-CH3 (Toluene, 1) and -C2H5 (Ethylbenzene, 5):** Alkyl groups are activating and direct ortho-para. The key factor determining the ortho/para ratio between them is steric hindrance. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased size makes it more difficult for the incoming electrophile (the bulky bromine) to attack the ortho positions, thus favoring the less hindered para position to a greater extent. Therefore, ethylbenzene will have a higher para/ortho ratio than toluene.\n    *   The bromination of toluene yields about 67% para-isomer.\n    *   The bromination of ethylbenzene is expected to yield an even higher percentage of the para-isomer due to increased steric hindrance at the ortho position.\n\nSo, for the ortho-, para-directors, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is:\n**Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**\n\n### **Step 3: Combine the Rankings**\n\nBy combining the two groups, we establish the final order from the lowest percentage of para-isomer to the highest:\n\n**4 (-NO2) < 6 (-COOH) < 2 (-COOC2H5) < 1 (-CH3) < 5 (-C2H5) < 3 (-Cl)**\n\nThis sequence matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
