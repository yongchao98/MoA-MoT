    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the spectroscopic data to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. A benzene ring itself has a DBE of 4 (one ring and three double bonds). The FTIR spectrum shows an ester group (-COO-), which contains a C=O double bond, adding 1 to the DBE. The ¹H NMR spectrum shows two signals for vinyl-H, indicating the presence of a C=C double bond, which adds another 1 to the DBE.\n    *   Total DBE = 4 (aromatic ring) + 1 (ester C=O) + 1 (vinyl C=C) = 6.\n\n2.  **Calculate the DBE for each possible formula:** The formula for DBE is `C - H/2 + 1` (ignoring the oxygen atoms as they don't affect the calculation).\n    *   A) C11H14O2: DBE = 11 - (14/2) + 1 = 11 - 7 + 1 = 5. This does not match the required DBE of 6.\n    *   B) C12H14O2: DBE = 12 - (14/2) + 1 = 12 - 7 + 1 = 6. This matches the required DBE.\n    *   C) C11H12O2: DBE = 11 - (12/2) + 1 = 11 - 6 + 1 = 6. This matches the required DBE.\n    *   D) C12H12O2: DBE = 12 - (12/2) + 1 = 12 - 6 + 1 = 7. This does not match the required DBE of 6.\n\n    Based on the DBE calculation, we can eliminate options A and D. We are left with C11H14O2 and C11H12O2. Let's recheck the calculation for B. C12H14O2: DBE = 12 - 7 + 1 = 6. So B and C are possible based on DBE alone.\n\n3.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Data to Build the Structure:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** There are two signals for aromatic hydrogens. A di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4) with a para (1,4) substitution pattern would give two distinct signals due to symmetry. This accounts for `C6H4`.\n    *   **Vinyl Region:** There are two signals for vinyl hydrogens. One is a doublet, and the other is a doublet of quartets. This pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`). The hydrogen on the carbon next to the ring would be split by the other vinyl hydrogen (doublet). The other vinyl hydrogen would be split by the first vinyl hydrogen (doublet) and by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. This fragment accounts for `C3H5` (`-CH=CH-CH3`).\n    *   **Alkyl Region:** There are two signals for -CH3 groups. One of these is accounted for by the propenyl group. The second -CH3 group must be part of the ester. Since the compound has no -CH2- groups, the ester must be either a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate ester (`-OCOCH3`). Both of these contain a methyl group.\n    *   **Absence of -CH2-:** The explicit mention of no signals for -CH2- groups is a crucial clue.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Formula:**\n    *   We have a para-substituted benzene ring: `C6H4`.\n    *   We have a propenyl substituent: `-C3H5`.\n    *   We have an ester that includes a methyl group. Let's assume a methyl ester group: `-COOCH3`. This accounts for `C2H3O2`.\n\n    Let's assemble these pieces into a final structure: `methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate`.\n    The total formula is the sum of the parts: C6H4 (ring) + C3H5 (propenyl) + COOCH3 (methyl ester group).\n    *   **Carbons:** 6 (ring) + 3 (propenyl) + 1 (carbonyl) + 1 (methyl ester) = 11 Carbons.\n    *   **Hydrogens:** 4 (ring) + 5 (propenyl) + 3 (methyl ester) = 12 Hydrogens.\n    *   **Oxygens:** 2 (ester) = 2 Oxygens.\n    *   The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n5.  **Final Check:**\n    *   The derived formula C11H12O2 matches option C.\n    *   The DBE for C11H12O2 is 6, which is consistent with our analysis.\n    *   The structure derived from the NMR data has no -CH2- groups.\n    *   Let's consider option B (C12H14O2). To get from C11H12O2 to C12H14O2, we would need to add a `CH2` group. However, the problem states there are no signals for -CH2- groups, which makes C12H14O2 impossible.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical formula that fits all the given spectral data is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>"
