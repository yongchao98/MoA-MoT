    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the difference between the relativistic and classical kinetic energy of the more massive fragment.\n\n### 1. Define Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   An atomic nucleus at rest with mass M.\n    *   Rest-mass energy: Mc² = 300 GeV.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   Two fragments with rest-masses m₁ and m₂.\n    *   m₁ is the more massive fragment, with m₁ = 2m₂.\n    *   The sum of the fragment rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M.\n\n### 2. Calculate Fragment Masses and Energy Released\n\nFirst, we determine the rest-mass energies of the two fragments. We have a system of two equations:\n1.  m₁ = 2m₂\n2.  m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M\n3m₂ = 0.99M\nm₂ = 0.33M\n\nNow, find m₁:\nm₁ = 2 * (0.33M) = 0.66M\n\nNext, we calculate their rest-mass energies:\n*   **m₁c²** = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = **198 GeV**\n*   **m₂c²** = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = **99 GeV**\n\nThe total energy released as kinetic energy (Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest energy and the total final rest energy.\n*   **Q** = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = **3 GeV**\n\nThis released energy is shared between the two fragments as kinetic energy: T₁ + T₂ = Q = 3 GeV.\n\n### 3. Relativistic Calculation (Correct T₁)\n\nIn spontaneous fission, the initial momentum is zero. Due to the conservation of momentum, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. For relativistic particles, the relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass (m) is E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². The kinetic energy (T) is the total energy minus the rest-mass energy (T = E - mc²).\n\nFrom the energy-momentum relation, we can write:\n(pc)² = E² - (mc²)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2Tmc²\n\nSince the momenta are equal (|p₁| = |p₂|), we have (p₁c)² = (p₂c)²:\nT₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c²\n\nWe also know that T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3 - T₁. Substituting this into the equation:\nT₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)\nT₁² + 396T₁ = 9 - 6T₁ + T₁² + 594 - 198T₁\n\nSimplifying the equation by canceling T₁² from both sides:\n396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁\n600T₁ = 603\nT₁ = 603 / 600 GeV = **1.005 GeV**\n\nConverting to MeV:\nT₁ = 1.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = **1005 MeV**\n\n### 4. Classical Calculation (Approximate T₁)\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is T_cl = ½mv² and momentum is p_cl = mv. This gives the relationship p_cl² = 2mT_cl.\n\nFrom the conservation of momentum (p₁_cl = p₂_cl):\n2m₁T₁_cl = 2m₂T₂_cl\nm₁T₁_cl = m₂T₂_cl\n\nSince m₁ = 2m₂, we have:\n2m₂T₁_cl = m₂T₂_cl\nT₂_cl = 2T₁_cl\n\nThe total kinetic energy is still Q = 3 GeV:\nT₁_cl + T₂_cl = 3 GeV\nT₁_cl + 2T₁_cl = 3 GeV\n3T₁_cl = 3 GeV\nT₁_cl = **1 GeV**\n\nConverting to MeV:\nT₁_cl = 1 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = **1000 MeV**\n\n### 5. Calculate the Difference\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation:\nDifference = T₁ - T₁_cl = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = **5 MeV**\n\n<<<C>>>"
