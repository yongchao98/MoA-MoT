    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of product 3 and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n**Step 1: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid.**\nThis is an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction, specifically the nitration of toluene. The methyl group (-CH₃) is an ortho-, para-directing activator. The reaction produces a mixture of ortho- and para-nitrotoluene. Given that no specific isomer is mentioned, we will consider the major product, which is p-nitrotoluene (4-nitrotoluene), as product 1, due to less steric hindrance at the para position.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is treated with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄.**\nProduct 1 (p-nitrotoluene) is subjected to oxidation. MnO₂ in the presence of sulfuric acid is an oxidizing agent. While this combination can oxidize a methyl group on a benzene ring to a carboxylic acid (p-nitrobenzoic acid), it can also, under certain conditions, result in partial oxidation to an aldehyde. Another possibility is a \"nitroxidation\" reaction where both nitration and oxidation occur; treating p-nitrotoluene with a nitrating mixture and MnO₂ can yield 2,4-dinitrobenzaldehyde.\n\nFor the subsequent reaction in step 3 to proceed to a product with one of the given symmetries, the most plausible intermediate is p-nitrobenzaldehyde. If the reaction proceeded to p-nitrobenzoic acid, the final product would likely be a Meisenheimer complex, which lacks the symmetry required by the answer choices. Therefore, it is logical to assume that product 2 is p-nitrobenzaldehyde.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide.**\nThis step involves the reaction of p-nitrobenzaldehyde (product 2) with acetone in the presence of a base (NaOH). This is a classic base-catalyzed aldol condensation, specifically a Claisen-Schmidt condensation. The hydroxide ion removes an acidic α-proton from acetone to form an enolate, which then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of p-nitrobenzaldehyde. The resulting β-hydroxy ketone readily undergoes dehydration (loss of water) to form the more stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated ketone. The final product, product 3, is 4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n\n**Molecular Symmetry of Product 3**\nThe structure of product 3 is 4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one. To determine its molecular symmetry group, we analyze its symmetry elements. The most stable conformation of this molecule is the (E)-isomer, where the entire conjugated system, including the benzene ring, the double bond, and the carbonyl group, is planar to maximize π-orbital overlap.\n\nThis planar structure possesses a plane of symmetry (σ) that is coplanar with the molecule itself. This plane contains the benzene ring, the nitro group, the carbon-carbon double bond, and the carbonyl group. One hydrogen of the methyl group can also lie in this plane, with the other two positioned symmetrically above and below it. The molecule does not possess any rotational axes (other than the trivial C₁), an inversion center, or any improper rotation axes.\n\nA molecule that has only the identity element (E) and a single mirror plane (σ) belongs to the **Cs** point group.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of product 3 is Cs.\n\n<<<C>>>"
