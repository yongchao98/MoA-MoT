    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures.\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**\n    The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\n    `T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`\n    where `T_star` is the star's temperature, `R_star` is the star's radius, `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, and `A` is the planet's albedo.\n\n    We want to find the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2`.\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (R_star / (2*a1))^(1/2) * (1 - A1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2*a2))^(1/2) * (1 - A2)^(1/4)]`\n\n    Since both planets orbit the same star (`T_star` and `R_star` are constant) and have the same albedo (`A1 = A2`), the formula simplifies to:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (1/a1)^(1/2) / (1/a2)^(1/2) = (a2 / a1)^(1/2)`\n\n2.  **Relating Doppler Shift to Radial Velocity Amplitude (K)**\n    The maximum Doppler shift `Δλ` is related to the star's maximum radial velocity `K` (the semi-amplitude of the RV curve) by:\n    `K = c * (Δλ / λ)`\n    where `c` is the speed of light and `λ` is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\n    The ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes for the two planets is:\n    `K1 / K2 = (c * Δλ1 / λ) / (c * Δλ2 / λ) = Δλ1 / Δλ2`\n    Given `Δλ1 = 0.03 Å` and `Δλ2 = 0.04 Å`:\n    `K1 / K2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4`\n\n3.  **Relating Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Parameters**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude `K` is given by:\n    `K = (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * v_p`\n    where `M_p` is the planet's mass, `M_star` is the star's mass, `i` is the orbital inclination, and `v_p` is the planet's orbital velocity.\n    The planet's orbital velocity `v_p` is given by `sqrt(G * M_star / a)`.\n\n    Substituting `v_p` into the equation for `K`:\n    `K = (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a) = (M_p * sin(i) / sqrt(M_star)) * sqrt(G/a)`\n\n    Since both planets were detected by the transit method, we can assume their orbits are edge-on, meaning the inclination `i ≈ 90°` and `sin(i) ≈ 1`.\n    So, `K ≈ (M_p / sqrt(M_star)) * sqrt(G/a)`.\n\n4.  **Finding the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a2 / a1)**\n    From the formula above, we can see that `K` is proportional to `M_p / sqrt(a)`.\n    `K ∝ M_p / a^(1/2)`\n    Rearranging for `a`:\n    `a^(1/2) ∝ M_p / K`\n    `a ∝ (M_p / K)²`\n\n    Now we can find the ratio `a2 / a1`:\n    `a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / K2)² / (M_p1 / K1)² = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K1 / K2)²`\n\n    We are given the masses `M_p1 = 7 M_earth` and `M_p2 = 5 M_earth`, so `M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7`.\n    We previously calculated `K1 / K2 = 3 / 4`.\n\n    Substitute these values into the equation for `a2 / a1`:\n    `a2 / a1 = (5 / 7)² * (3 / 4)² = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16) = 225 / 784`\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**\n    Now, substitute the value of `a2 / a1` back into the temperature ratio equation:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a2 / a1)^(1/2) = (225 / 784)^(1/2)`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225) / sqrt(784) = 15 / 28`\n\n    Converting the fraction to a decimal:\n    `15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<C>>>"
