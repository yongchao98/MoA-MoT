    "To solve this problem, we must calculate the energy of a photon that can be absorbed by the diatomic molecule XY, causing it to transition from its ground state to the next lowest possible energy state, and then determine the photon's momentum.\n\n**1. Understanding the Molecular State and Transitions**\n\nThe energy of a diatomic molecule in the quantum rotation-vibration model is determined by its vibrational quantum number (v) and rotational quantum number (J). The total energy E(v, J) is the sum of the vibrational and rotational energies.\n\n*   **Ground State:** The lowest energy state, or ground state, corresponds to the lowest quantum numbers, which are v=0 and J=0.\n*   **Selection Rules:** For a photon to be absorbed by a diatomic molecule and induce a ro-vibrational transition, specific selection rules must be followed. For the fundamental transition, the change in quantum numbers must be Δv = +1 and ΔJ = ±1.\n*   **Transition from Ground State:** Starting from the ground state (v=0, J=0), the only allowed transition according to these rules is to the state where v=1 and J=1 (since J cannot become negative). Therefore, the \"next state with the lowest possible energy\" accessible via photon absorption is the (v=1, J=1) state.\n\n**2. Calculating the Transition Energy (ΔE)**\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon must equal the energy difference between the final and initial states.\n\n*   **Energy Levels Formula:** The energy of a given state (v, J) is:\n    E(v, J) = ħω(v + 1/2) + (ħ² / 2I) * J(J+1)\n    where:\n    *   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n    *   ω is the angular frequency of vibration.\n    *   I is the moment of inertia.\n\n*   **Energy Difference:** The energy for the transition from (v=0, J=0) to (v=1, J=1) is:\n    ΔE = E(1, 1) - E(0, 0)\n    ΔE = [ħω(1 + 1/2) + (ħ²/2I) * 1(1+1)] - [ħω(0 + 1/2) + (ħ²/2I) * 0(0+1)]\n    ΔE = [ (3/2)ħω + ħ²/I ] - [ (1/2)ħω + 0 ]\n    ΔE = ħω + ħ²/I\n\n**3. Calculating the Moment of Inertia (I)**\n\nThe moment of inertia depends on the reduced mass (μ) and the bond length (R).\n\n*   **Reduced Mass (μ):**\n    μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)\n    Given: Mx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu\n    μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 amu ≈ 1.8182 amu\n    Converting to kg (1 amu ≈ 1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg):\n    μ ≈ 1.8182 * 1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg ≈ 3.0192 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n\n*   **Moment of Inertia (I):**\n    I = μ * R²\n    Given: R = 2 angstroms = 2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n    I ≈ (3.0192 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)²\n    I ≈ 1.2077 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n\n**4. Final Energy and Momentum Calculation**\n\nNow we can calculate the total energy change and the corresponding photon momentum.\n\n*   **Vibrational Energy Change (ħω):**\n    Given: ω = 4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s\n    ΔE_vib = ħω = (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s) ≈ 4.2183 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n\n*   **Rotational Energy Change (ħ²/I):**\n    ΔE_rot = ħ²/I = (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (1.2077 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²) ≈ 9.208 x 10⁻²³ J\n\n*   **Total Energy Change (ΔE):**\n    ΔE = ΔE_vib + ΔE_rot ≈ 4.2183 x 10⁻²⁰ J + 0.0009208 x 10⁻²⁰ J ≈ 4.2184 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n    (Note: The rotational energy contribution is negligible compared to the vibrational energy.)\n\n*   **Photon Momentum (p):**\n    The energy of a photon is related to its momentum by the equation E = pc, where c is the speed of light (≈ 2.9979 x 10⁸ m/s).\n    p = ΔE / c\n    p ≈ (4.2184 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (2.9979 x 10⁸ m/s)\n    p ≈ 1.407 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n\nThis calculated value is approximately 1.4 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) p = 1.4*10^(-28) N*s\nB) p = 1.1*10^(-27) N*s\nC) p = 1.9*10^(-28) N*s\nD) p = 2.3*10^(-27) N*s\n\nThe calculated momentum matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
