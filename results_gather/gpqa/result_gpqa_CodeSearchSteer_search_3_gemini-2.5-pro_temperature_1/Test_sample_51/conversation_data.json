    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the final answer.\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the factor by which the ratio of the populations of two energy levels of neutral Titanium (Ti) changes when the star's effective temperature drops from 6000 K (no spots) to 5500 K (with spots). This factor is `Ratio_nospots / Ratio_spots`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Governing Physics:** Since the stellar photosphere is assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the population of atoms in different energy levels is described by the Boltzmann distribution.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** The ratio `R` of the number of atoms in two energy levels (n₁ and n₂) is given by the Boltzmann equation. Let's denote the ratio as R. The problem states that this ratio *decreases* as the star develops spots, meaning the ratio is lower at 5500 K than at 6000 K.\n    *   The ratio of populations is generally given by `(n₂/n₁) = (g₂/g₁) * exp(-(E₂ - E₁)/(kT))`, where `g` is the statistical weight, `E` is the energy, `k` is the Boltzmann constant, and `T` is the temperature.\n    *   For the ratio to decrease with temperature, it must be proportional to `exp(-ΔE / kT)`, where `ΔE` is the positive energy difference between the two levels. This ensures that as `T` decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, and the ratio decreases.\n    *   So, we have `R(T) ∝ exp(-ΔE / kT)`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy Difference (ΔE):** The problem states that the transition between the two energy levels corresponds to a wavelength (λ) of 1448 Å. The energy difference `ΔE` is the energy of a photon with this wavelength.\n    *   The formula relating photon energy to wavelength is `ΔE = h * c / λ`, where `h` is Planck's constant and `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   λ = 1448 Å = 144.8 nm.\n    *   A convenient formula for this calculation is `ΔE (in eV) = 1240 / λ (in nm)`.\n    *   ΔE = 1240 / 144.8 ≈ 8.5635 eV.\n\n5.  **Set up the Factor Calculation:** We need to compute the factor `R(6000 K) / R(5500 K)`.\n    *   Factor = `[C * exp(-ΔE / (k * 6000))] / [C * exp(-ΔE / (k * 5500))]`\n    *   The constant `C` cancels out.\n    *   Factor = `exp[(-ΔE/k) * (1/6000 - 1/5500)]`\n    *   Factor = `exp[(-ΔE/k) * ((5500 - 6000) / (6000 * 5500))]`\n    *   Factor = `exp[(-ΔE/k) * (-500 / 33,000,000)]`\n    *   Factor = `exp[(ΔE/k) * (500 / 33,000,000)]`\n    *   Factor = `exp[(ΔE/k) * (1 / 66,000)]`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    *   We need the value of `ΔE / k`.\n    *   k (Boltzmann constant) ≈ 8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K.\n    *   `ΔE / k` ≈ 8.5635 eV / (8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K) ≈ 99376 K.\n    *   Now, substitute this into the exponent: Exponent ≈ 99376 / 66000 ≈ 1.5057.\n    *   Factor = `exp(1.5057)` ≈ 4.507.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The calculated factor is approximately 4.5. This corresponds to option C. The extraneous information about the star's radius, mass, and the percentage of spot coverage is not needed for the calculation itself but provides context for the change in effective temperature.\n\n<<<C>>>"
