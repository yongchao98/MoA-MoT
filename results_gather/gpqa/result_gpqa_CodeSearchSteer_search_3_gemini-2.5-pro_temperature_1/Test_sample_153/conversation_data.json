    "Based on the spectral information, the most reasonable structure for the unidentified compound is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**. Here is a detailed analysis of why this structure is the correct choice:\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry (MS):** The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound. The presence of a significant peak at m/z = 158, which is about one-third the intensity of the main peak, is a classic isotopic signature for a compound containing one chlorine atom (due to the natural abundance of the ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes). 4-chlorobenzoic acid (C₇H₅ClO₂) has a molecular weight of approximately 156.57 g/mol, which is consistent with this data.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:** The spectrum shows two key features. First, an extremely broad absorption between 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H bond in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. Second, the strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The singlet at a very downfield chemical shift of 11.0 ppm is indicative of a highly acidic proton, which is characteristic of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   The aromatic region displays two doublets at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm, with each signal integrating to two protons (2H). This symmetrical pattern of two doublets is a hallmark of a *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The protons next to the electron-withdrawing carboxyl group are shifted further downfield (8.02 ppm) compared to the protons next to the chlorine atom.\n\n### Evaluation of Other Options:\n\n*   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** While it matches the molecular weight and IR data, its *ortho*-substitution pattern would produce a more complex and asymmetric set of signals in the aromatic region of the ¹H NMR spectrum, not two simple doublets.\n*   **B) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This compound lacks a carboxylic acid, so it would not show a proton signal around 11.0 ppm in the ¹H NMR, nor the very broad O-H stretch characteristic of a carboxylic acid in the IR spectrum.\n*   **C) Phenyl chloroformate:** This molecule lacks an O-H group entirely, which is inconsistent with the IR spectrum. It also does not have a carboxylic acid proton, which contradicts the ¹H NMR data.\n\nTherefore, the combined evidence from all three spectroscopic techniques points conclusively to 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>"
