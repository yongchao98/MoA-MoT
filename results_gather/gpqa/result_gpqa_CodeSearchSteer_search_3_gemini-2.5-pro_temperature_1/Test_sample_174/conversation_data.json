    "An oscillating spheroidal charge distribution with its symmetry axis along the z-axis can be modeled as an oscillating electric dipole, provided its dimensions are much smaller than the wavelength of the radiation. The time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle, `(dP)/(dOmega)`, by such a dipole is a function of the angle `theta` with the z-axis and the wavelength `lambda`.\n\nThe formula for the radiated power per unit solid angle is given by:\n\n`(dP)/(dOmega) = (p_0^2 omega^4)/(32pi^2epsilon_0c^3) sin^2(theta)`\n\nHere, `p_0` is the amplitude of the electric dipole moment, `omega` is the angular frequency of oscillation, `epsilon_0` is the permittivity of free space, and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n**Angular Dependence:**\n\nThe radiated power is proportional to `sin^2(theta)`. The maximum power, `A`, is radiated when `sin^2(theta)` is at its maximum value of 1, which occurs at `theta = 90^0` (perpendicular to the axis of oscillation).\n\nTo find the fraction of the maximum power radiated at `theta = 30^0`, we calculate `sin^2(30^0)`:\n\n`sin(30^0) = 1/2`\n`sin^2(30^0) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4`\n\nTherefore, the power radiated at `30^0` is `A/4`, and the fraction is 1/4.\n\n**Wavelength Dependence:**\n\nThe angular frequency `omega` is related to the wavelength `lambda` by the equation `omega = (2pic)/lambda`. The radiated power is proportional to `omega^4`.\n\nSubstituting the relation for `omega` into the proportionality gives:\n\n`(dP)/(dOmega) prop omega^4 prop ((2pic)/lambda)^4 prop 1/lambda^4 prop lambda^(-4)`\n\nThis `lambda^(-4)` dependence is characteristic of electric dipole radiation, a phenomenon also known as Rayleigh scattering, which explains why the sky appears blue.\n\nCombining these two results, the fraction of the maximum power `A` radiated at an angle `theta = 30^0` is 1/4, and a possible form for the wavelength dependence of the function `f` is `lambda^(-4)`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
