    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical transformations and spectroscopic data to determine the final product and its NMR spectrum.\n\n### Step 1: Identification of Product 1\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C₁₀H₁₄Br₂).\n2.  **Reagents:** Excess KOH at 240°C. This is a high-temperature reaction with a strong base on a tertiary dihalide. Such conditions often promote complex rearrangements and/or fragmentations, rather than simple substitution or elimination.\n3.  **Spectroscopic Data for Product 1:**\n    *   **¹H NMR:** The spectrum shows 14 protons in total (2H + 10H + 2H), which is the same number of protons as the starting material. This implies the molecular formula of the product is C₁₀H₁₄O, as the reaction with KOH typically replaces bromine with oxygen functionalities.\n    *   **IR:** A strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a ketone (C=O) group, likely in a strained or five-membered ring.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** A signal at 4.79 ppm (2H) is in the vinylic region, strongly suggesting the presence of a double bond. The integration of 2H and its chemical shift are consistent with an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂).\n4.  **Structure Determination:**\n    *   The formula C₁₀H₁₄O has four degrees of unsaturation. The adamantane skeleton has three rings (3 degrees). A ketone C=O adds a fourth degree. However, the presence of a C=C double bond means the tricyclic adamantane cage must have opened to form a bicyclic structure. Degrees of unsaturation = (2 rings) + (1 C=O) + (1 C=C) = 4.\n    *   A known reaction pathway for adamantane derivatives under these conditions is rearrangement to a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane skeleton.\n    *   A structure that fits all the data is **2-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**.\n        *   **Formula:** C₁₀H₁₄O. (Correct proton count: 1H at C1, 2H at C4, 1H at C5, 2H at C6, 2H at C7, 2H at C8, 2H at C9, plus 2H on the methylene group = 14H).\n        *   **Functional Groups:** It contains a ketone (conjugated with the double bond, which is consistent with the IR value) and an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂), explaining the ¹H NMR signal at 4.79 ppm.\n\n### Step 2: Identification of Product 2\n\n1.  **Reaction:** Product 1 is heated with aluminum isopropoxide. This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction.\n2.  **Transformation:** The MPV reduction selectively reduces ketones to alcohols. The double bond remains unchanged.\n3.  **Product 2 Structure:** The ketone in 2-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one is reduced to a hydroxyl group. Product 2 is **2-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n### Step 3: Identification of Product 3\n\n1.  **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) at low temperature, followed by dimethyl sulfide (DMS). This is an ozonolysis reaction with a reductive workup.\n2.  **Transformation:** Ozonolysis cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond. The reductive workup with DMS converts the cleaved ends into aldehydes or ketones.\n3.  **Product 3 Structure:** The exocyclic double bond (C=CH₂) of Product 2 is cleaved. The terminal CH₂ group becomes formaldehyde (which is removed during workup), and the internal carbon of the double bond (C2) becomes a ketone (C=O). The alcohol group at C3 is unaffected.\n4.  Therefore, Product 3 is **3-hydroxy-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-2-one**.\n\n### Step 4: ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3\n\n1.  **Structure:** 3-hydroxy-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-2-one.\n2.  **Most Deshielded Proton:** We need to identify the non-exchangeable proton with the highest chemical shift.\n    *   Protons alpha to the ketone (at C1 and C3) are deshielded.\n    *   The proton on the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (at C3) is also deshielded.\n    *   The proton at C3 is subjected to both of these deshielding effects (alpha to a ketone and on a carbon with an alcohol). It will be the most deshielded proton in the molecule (typically δ > 4.0 ppm).\n3.  **Coupling Pattern of the C3-Proton (H3):** To determine the splitting pattern (multiplicity) of H3, we must identify all neighboring protons it couples to.\n    *   **Vicinal Coupling (³J):** H3 will couple to the two adjacent protons on C4 (H4a and H4b). In a simplified model where these two protons are treated as magnetically equivalent, this coupling would produce a triplet (n+1 = 2+1 = 3).\n    *   **Long-Range Coupling (⁴J):** Rigid bicyclic systems like this one often exhibit long-range coupling through space or through a \"W\"-shaped arrangement of bonds. The H3 proton is in a position to have a significant W-coupling (⁴J) with the bridgehead proton at C5 (H5).\n4.  **Resulting Pattern:**\n    *   The coupling to the single H5 proton would split the H3 signal into a **doublet**.\n    *   The coupling to the two H4 protons would split each line of that doublet into a **triplet** (assuming H4a and H4b are treated as equivalent).\n    *   The final, combined pattern is therefore a **doublet of triplets**. While in reality the two H4 protons are not equivalent and would give a doublet of doublets, \"doublet of triplets\" is a common representation in problems of this nature and is one of the options provided. It reflects the coupling to two distinct sets of neighbors: one set of a single proton (H5) and one set of two protons (the C4 protons).\n\nBased on this analysis, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in product 3 is a doublet of triplets.\n\n<<<A>>>"
