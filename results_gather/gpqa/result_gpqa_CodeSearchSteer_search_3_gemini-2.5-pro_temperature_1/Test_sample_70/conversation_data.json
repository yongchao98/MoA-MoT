    "The search results confirm the physical principles I used for the calculation.\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature:** The planetary equilibrium temperature (T_eq) is the theoretical temperature a planet would have if it were a black body heated only by its star. The formula involves the star's temperature and radius, and the planet's distance and albedo. Multiple sources confirm that for a given star and a planet with a given albedo, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance (a).\n    *   T_eq ∝ (1/a)^(1/2)\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law:** The square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a). This can be expressed as a ratio for two planets orbiting the same star: (P₁/P₂)² = (a₁/a₂)³. For the circular orbits specified in the problem, the semi-major axis is the orbital distance.\n\nThe steps derived in my initial thinking process are correct. I will proceed with the calculation.\n\n**Step-by-step derivation:**\n\n1.  The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) is related to the semi-major axis (a) by the proportionality:\n    T_eq ∝ (1/a)^(1/2)\n\n2.  Therefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 4 and Planet 2 is:\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (a2 / a4)^(1/2)\n\n3.  According to Kepler's Third Law, the relationship between the orbital period (P) and the semi-major axis (a) is P² ∝ a³.\n\n4.  This means a ∝ P^(2/3). We can write the ratio of the semi-major axes as:\n    a2 / a4 = (P2 / P4)^(2/3)\n\n5.  Substitute the expression for the semi-major axis ratio back into the temperature ratio equation:\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = [ (P2 / P4)^(2/3) ]^(1/2)\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P2 / P4)^((2/3) * (1/2))\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P2 / P4)^(1/3)\n\n6.  From the problem statement, the ratio of orbital periods is P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\n    Therefore, the ratio of the periods of Planet 2 to Planet 4 is:\n    P2 / P4 = 2 / 3.5\n\n7.  Now, calculate the final temperature ratio:\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (0.5714...)^(1/3)\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.8298\n\nThis value is approximately 0.83.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) ~0.75\nB) ~0.57\nC) ~0.69\nD) ~0.83\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\nThe problem relies on fundamental relationships.\n- Equilibrium Temperature vs. distance from star.\n- Distance from star vs. orbital period (Kepler's 3rd Law).\n\nThe logic is sound and the calculation is straightforward. The other information in the prompt (TTV method, five planets, orbital resonance) is context to create a plausible astrophysical scenario but is not needed for the calculation itself, other than providing the period ratios. The assumption of same albedo and circular orbits simplifies the problem to these two core principles.\n\nFinal answer is D.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is proportional to the inverse square root of its semi-major axis (a), assuming the same stellar properties and planetary albedo:\nT_eq ∝ (1/a)^(1/2)\n\nThe ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 4 and Planet 2 is therefore:\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (a2 / a4)^(1/2)\n\nAccording to Kepler's Third Law, the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a³). This gives the relationship a ∝ P^(2/3).\nThe ratio of the semi-major axes can be expressed in terms of their orbital periods:\na2 / a4 = (P2 / P4)^(2/3)\n\nSubstituting this into the temperature ratio equation:\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = [(P2 / P4)^(2/3)]^(1/2) = (P2 / P4)^(1/3)\n\nThe problem states the orbital periods are in a ratio of P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\nThus, the ratio P2 / P4 is 2 / 3.5.\n\nNow, we can calculate the temperature ratio:\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (0.571428...)^(1/3)\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.8298\n\nThis value is approximately 0.83.\n\n<<<D>>>"
