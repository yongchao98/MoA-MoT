    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the chemical puzzle and determine the molecular weight range of substance A4.\n\n**1. Identifying Element Y and Substance A2**\n\nThe problem states that substance A2 has a mass fraction of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula for A2 be YFₙ. The molar mass of an element Y can be calculated using the formula:\nM(Y) = (n × M(F) / ɷF) - (n × M(F))\n\nUsing the atomic mass of Fluorine (F) as ~19 g/mol and the given mass fraction (0.3196):\nM(Y) ≈ (n × 19 / 0.3196) - (n × 19) ≈ 40.45n\n\nWe can test integer values for 'n':\n*   If n = 1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (resembles Calcium or Argon, which are chemically unlikely candidates based on the other information).\n*   If n = 2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is very close to the atomic mass of Krypton (Kr), which is 83.8 g/mol. Let's verify the mass percentage for KrF₂. Using precise atomic masses (Kr ≈ 83.8 g/mol, F ≈ 19 g/mol), the mass percentage of fluorine in KrF₂ is (2 * 19) / (83.8 + 2 * 19) = 38 / 121.8 ≈ 31.2%. This is very close to the given 31.96%.\n\nLet's assume Y is Krypton (Kr) and A2 is Krypton difluoride (KrF₂).\n\n**2. Identifying Substances A1, A3, A4, and A5**\n\n*   **A1:** It is described as a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (20 °C) into A2 (KrF₂) and fluorine. This implies the reaction: A1 → KrF₂ + F₂. Therefore, A1 must be Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄). KrF₄ is known to be thermally unstable. One inconsistency is its color; KrF₄ is reported as a white crystalline solid, not bright-red. However, given the other fitting evidence, this might be an inaccuracy in the problem description. Importantly, A1 (KrF₄) is a powerful oxidizing agent and would oxidize xenon, which fits the description.\n*   **A3:** This substance is obtained by the fluorination of element Y (Krypton) and also interacts with xenon. The direct fluorination of Krypton produces KrF₂. So, A3 is KrF₂.\n*   **A4 and A5:** A5 is formed by adding Y (Kr) to a hot, colorless, concentrated solution of A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio. Considering the known binary fluorides of Krypton (KrF₂ and KrF₄), this reaction is most plausibly the comproportionation of Krypton metal with Krypton tetrafluoride:\n    Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂\n    This reaction fits the 1:1 molar ratio of the reactants. This identifies **A4 as KrF₄** and **A5 as KrF₂**. The \"hot colorless concentrated solution\" could refer to KrF₄ dissolved in a solvent like anhydrous hydrogen fluoride (HF).\n\n**3. Verifying the Final Clues**\n\n*   **Five binary compounds:** The problem states that five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known. For Krypton, only KrF₂ is well-characterized, and KrF₄ is highly unstable and its initial discovery was later disputed. However, theoretical calculations suggest other fluorides like KrF₆ could exist under specific conditions, and various ions like KrF⁺ and Kr₂F₃⁺ are known. This clue might be interpreted loosely to include these species.\n*   **Decomposition of A5 in water:** The problem states that A5 (KrF₂) decomposes in water to form two substances. The hydrolysis of KrF₂ is complex, but one possible interpretation is the simple decomposition into its constituent elements, which can be facilitated by water:\n    KrF₂ → Kr + F₂\n    This yields two distinct substances, Krypton gas and Fluorine gas, fitting the description.\n\n**4. Calculating the Molecular Weight of A4**\n\nBased on the deductions, substance A4 is Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄).\nThe molecular weight is calculated as:\nM(A4) = M(Kr) + 4 × M(F)\nM(A4) ≈ 83.8 g/mol + 4 × 19.0 g/mol = 159.8 g/mol.\n\n**5. Selecting the Correct Range**\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of A4 is 159.8 g/mol. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 220-240\nB) 140-160\nC) 110-130\nD) 160-180\n\nThe value 159.8 g/mol falls squarely within the range of 140-160 g/mol.\n\n<<<B>>>"
