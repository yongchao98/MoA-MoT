    "Here is the step-by-step derivation of how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with parallax, assuming a uniform distribution of stars in the sky.\n\n1.  **Uniform Star Distribution**: The initial assumption is that stars are distributed uniformly throughout space. This means the number of stars per unit volume, known as the stellar density (ρ), is constant.\n\n2.  **Number of Stars up to a Distance**: The number of stars (N) within a spherical volume of radius (d) is the product of the stellar density and the volume of the sphere.\n    *   Volume of a sphere (V) = (4/3)πd³\n    *   Therefore, the cumulative number of stars up to distance d is N(d) = ρ * (4/3)πd³\n\n3.  **Number of Stars in a Thin Shell**: To find how the number of stars changes with distance, we consider a thin spherical shell at a distance d with a small thickness Δd.\n    *   The volume of this shell (ΔV) is approximately its surface area (4πd²) multiplied by its thickness (Δd).\n    *   ΔV ≈ 4πd² * Δd\n    *   The number of stars within this shell (ΔN) is ΔN ≈ ρ * ΔV = 4πρd² * Δd.\n    *   In differential form, this gives the number of stars per unit distance: dN/dd = 4πρd².\n\n4.  **Relating Distance and Parallax**: Stellar parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance (d) to the star. The relationship is:\n    *   plx = 1/d, which means d = 1/plx.\n\n5.  **Finding the Number of Stars per Unit Parallax**: We want to find how the number of stars changes per unit of parallax, which is the derivative dN/d(plx). We can use the chain rule for derivatives:\n    *   dN/d(plx) = (dN/dd) * (dd/d(plx))\n\n6.  **Calculate the Derivative of Distance with Respect to Parallax**: We need to find the derivative of d = 1/plx with respect to plx.\n    *   dd/d(plx) = -1/plx²\n    *   Since we are interested in the number of stars, which must be a positive quantity, we consider the magnitude: |dd/d(plx)| = 1/plx².\n\n7.  **Combine the Equations**: Now, substitute the expressions for dN/dd and |dd/d(plx)| back into the chain rule equation.\n    *   dN/d(plx) = (4πρd²) * (1/plx²)\n\n8.  **Express in Terms of Parallax Only**: Finally, replace the distance (d) with its parallax equivalent (1/plx) in the equation.\n    *   dN/d(plx) = 4πρ * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²)\n    *   dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴\n\nSince 4, π, and ρ are constants, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to 1/plx⁴. This relationship is also noted in astronomical studies, such as in the context of the Lutz-Kelker bias.\n\n<<<B>>>"
