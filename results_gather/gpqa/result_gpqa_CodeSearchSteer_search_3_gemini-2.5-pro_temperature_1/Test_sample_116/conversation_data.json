    "An isomer is a molecule that has the same molecular formula as another molecule but differs in the arrangement of its atoms. These differences can be in the connectivity of the atoms (constitutional isomers) or their spatial arrangement (stereoisomers). Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. Optical isomers, or enantiomers, are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. A key feature for most optical isomers is the presence of a chiral center or an element of axial or planar chirality, and the absence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n1.  **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This compound is a substituted biphenyl. Due to the presence of bulky substituents (nitro and dimethyl carboxylate groups) at the ortho positions (the 2, 2', 6, and 6' positions), the rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is severely restricted. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, results in a molecule that is not superimposable on its mirror image, thus conferring chirality and optical activity.\n\n2.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule contains a carbon atom (at the 2-position) that is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four distinct substituents is a stereocenter, or chiral center, which makes the molecule chiral and thus optically active. It exists as two enantiomers, (R)-methyl lactate and (S)-methyl lactate.\n\n3.  **Benzophenone**: The chemical formula for benzophenone is (C6H5)2CO. The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and also bonded to two phenyl groups. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that bisects the C=O bond and the angle between the two phenyl rings. Individual benzophenone molecules are achiral and therefore do not exhibit optical isomerism. While it can form chiral crystals, the molecule itself is not chiral.\n\n4.  **Dimethyl fumarate**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The molecule has a center of symmetry and a plane of symmetry, rendering it achiral and incapable of optical isomerism.\n\nBased on this analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate are the moieties that exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n<<<C>>>"
