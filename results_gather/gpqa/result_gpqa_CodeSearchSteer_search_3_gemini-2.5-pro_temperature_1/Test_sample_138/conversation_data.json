    "The search results confirm that the reaction of a ketone with sodium nitrite (NaNO2) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) is a standard method for preparing 1,2-diketones. The reaction proceeds through the acid-catalyzed formation of an enol from the starting ketone. The enol then attacks the nitrosonium ion (NO+), which is generated from NaNO2 and HCl. The resulting α-nitroso ketone tautomerizes to an oxime, which is then hydrolyzed in the aqueous acidic solution to yield the final 1,2-diketone. This overall process converts a methylene group (–CH₂–) alpha (adjacent) to a carbonyl group into a second carbonyl group.\n\nLet's apply this confirmed mechanism to the specific reactions in the question.\n\n**Reaction A: Synthesis of 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione**\nThe product is a 1,2-diketone. This reaction involves the oxidation of the carbon atom at position 2 (the α-carbon) of a cyclohexanone ring. Therefore, the starting material (A) must be a ketone with the carbon skeleton of the product. The appropriate starting material is **4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one**. The reaction introduces a new carbonyl group at the C-2 position.\n\n**Reaction B: Synthesis of 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione**\nThe product is an acyclic 1,2-diketone. This means the reaction oxidized a methylene group adjacent to an existing carbonyl group. The starting material (B) must be a ketone. Based on the product's structure, the starting material could be either 5-methylhexan-2-one (where the methylene at C-3 is oxidized) or 5-methylhexan-3-one (where the methylene at C-2 is oxidized). Looking at the options provided, **5-methylhexan-2-one** is listed. When 5-methylhexan-2-one is treated with NaNO2/HCl, the methylene group at the C-3 position is oxidized to a carbonyl group, yielding the desired 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione.\n\nNow, we evaluate the given options:\n\n*   **A) A = 4-isopropyl-2-methoxycyclohexan-1-ol, B = 5-methylhexane-2,3-diol:** These are not ketones and are incorrect starting materials for this type of reaction.\n*   **B) A = 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one, B = 5-methylhexan-2-one:** This option correctly identifies both starting materials as ketones that would yield the respective diketone products upon reaction with NaNO2/HCl.\n*   **C) A = 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one, B = 5-methylhexane-2,3-diol:** Starting material A is correct, but B is a diol, which is incorrect.\n*   **D) A = 4-isopropyl-2-methoxycyclohexan-1-ol, B = 5-methylhexan-2-one:** Starting material A is incorrect, while B is correct.\n\nTherefore, the only option where both starting materials are correct is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
