    "To determine the pH of the final solution, we must first calculate the moles of each acid and base component and then determine which species is in excess after all neutralization reactions have occurred.\n\nHere is a step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Calculate the initial moles of each reactant:**\n    *   **CH3COOH (weak acid):** 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = 0.050 moles\n    *   **HCl (strong acid):** 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.080 moles. Since HCl is a strong acid, this provides 0.080 moles of H⁺ ions.\n    *   **Ba(OH)2 (strong base):** 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.090 moles. Since Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base that dissociates to provide two hydroxide ions per formula unit (Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻), the moles of OH⁻ are 0.090 moles × 2 = 0.180 moles.\n\n2.  **Neutralize the strong acid and strong base.** The H⁺ ions from HCl will react with the OH⁻ ions from Ba(OH)₂ in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   Initial moles of H⁺ = 0.080 mol\n    *   Initial moles of OH⁻ = 0.180 mol\n    *   The H⁺ ions are the limiting reactant. After neutralization, the moles of OH⁻ remaining are: 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 moles of OH⁻.\n\n3.  **React the remaining strong base with the weak acid.** The 0.100 moles of excess OH⁻ will now react with the weak acid, CH₃COOH.\n    *   Initial moles of CH₃COOH = 0.050 mol\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ available = 0.100 mol\n    *   The CH₃COOH is the limiting reactant in this step. All 0.050 moles will be neutralized.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining after reacting with the weak acid: 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 moles of OH⁻.\n\n4.  **Determine the composition of the final solution and calculate the pH.**\n    *   The final solution contains 0.050 moles of excess OH⁻ from the strong base. The presence of a strong base will dictate the pH, making the contribution from the conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻) negligible.\n    *   Calculate the total volume of the solution: 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.\n    *   Calculate the final concentration of OH⁻: [OH⁻] = 0.050 moles / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M.\n    *   Calculate the pOH: pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38.\n    *   Calculate the pH: pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.\n\nThe final pH of the solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<D>>>"
