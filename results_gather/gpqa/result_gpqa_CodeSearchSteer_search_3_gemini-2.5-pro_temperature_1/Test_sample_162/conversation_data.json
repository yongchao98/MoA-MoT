    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine the correct option.\n\nThe problem requires us to find the minimum volume of a strong monobasic acid needed to dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ and the pH of the resulting 100 cm³ solution.\n\n**1. The Chemical Reaction**\n\nFirst, the solid iron(III) hydroxide must react with the hydrogen ions (H⁺) from the strong acid to dissolve. The overall chemical equation for this process is:\n\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\n**2. Moles of Fe(OH)₃**\n\nWe need to calculate the number of moles corresponding to 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃.\n*   The molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ is approximately 106.87 g/mol.\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol ≈ 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol\n\n**3. Acid Required for the Reaction**\n\nBased on the stoichiometry of the reaction, 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ reacts with 3 moles of H⁺.\n*   Moles of H⁺ for reaction = 3 * Moles of Fe(OH)₃\n*   Moles of H⁺ for reaction = 3 * 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol ≈ 2.807 x 10⁻³ mol\n\nThis is the amount of acid needed just to neutralize the hydroxide and dissolve the solid.\n\n**4. Acid Required to Maintain the Final pH**\n\nThe resulting solution is acidic due to the presence of dissolved Fe³⁺ ions and the remaining excess H⁺ ions. The final pH of the solution determines the concentration of these excess H⁺ ions. We will test the values provided in the options. Let's analyze Option A.\n\n*   **If the final pH is 2.69 (from Option A):**\n    *   The concentration of H⁺ at equilibrium is [H⁺] = 10⁻ᵖᴴ = 10⁻²·⁶⁹ M ≈ 0.00204 M.\n    *   The amount of excess H⁺ in the final 100 cm³ (0.1 L) solution is:\n    *   Moles of excess H⁺ = Concentration * Volume = 0.00204 mol/L * 0.1 L = 2.04 x 10⁻⁴ mol.\n\n**5. Total Acid Volume**\n\nThe total amount of acid needed is the sum of the acid used in the reaction and the excess acid remaining to establish the final pH.\n\n*   Total moles of H⁺ = Moles for reaction + Moles of excess H⁺\n*   Total moles of H⁺ = (2.807 x 10⁻³) + (2.04 x 10⁻⁴) mol = 3.011 x 10⁻³ mol\n\nNow, we calculate the volume of the 0.1 M strong acid that contains this many moles.\n\n*   Volume = Total Moles / Concentration\n*   Volume = 3.011 x 10⁻³ mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.03011 L\n*   To convert to cm³, we multiply by 1000:\n*   Volume = 0.03011 L * 1000 cm³/L = 30.11 cm³\n\nThis calculated volume of 30.11 cm³ is a near-perfect match for the 30.09 cm³ provided in Option A. The minor difference can be attributed to rounding during intermediate steps or slight variations in the molar mass value used.\n\nLet's quickly check another option to confirm.\n\n*   **If the final pH is 2.04 (from Option B):**\n    *   [H⁺] = 10⁻²·⁰⁴ M ≈ 0.00912 M.\n    *   Moles of excess H⁺ = 0.00912 M * 0.1 L = 9.12 x 10⁻⁴ mol.\n    *   Total moles H⁺ = (2.807 x 10⁻³) + (9.12 x 10⁻⁴) = 3.719 x 10⁻³ mol.\n    *   Volume = 3.719 x 10⁻³ mol / 0.1 M = 0.03719 L = 37.19 cm³. This value does not match the 28.05 cm³ in option B.\n\nThe calculations confirm that the values in Option A are consistent.\n\n<<<A>>>"
