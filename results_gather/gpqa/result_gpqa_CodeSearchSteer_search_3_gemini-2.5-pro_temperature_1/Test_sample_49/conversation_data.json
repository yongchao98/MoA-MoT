    "The number of loops in a Feynman diagram can be determined from the factors of `1/(4π)` that appear in the mathematical expression for the diagram's amplitude.\n\nIn quantum field theory calculations set in four-dimensional spacetime, each loop in a Feynman diagram contributes a factor of `1/(4π)^2` to the overall expression. This factor arises from the integration over the loop's four-dimensional momentum.\n\nThe expression found on the note is:\n`alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`\n\nThe key term for determining the number of loops is `1/(4pi)^6`. We can express this term as:\n`1/(4pi)^6 = (1/(4pi)^2)^3`\n\nSince each loop contributes a factor of `1/(4pi)^2`, the exponent, in this case, `3`, directly indicates the number of loops in the diagram.\n\nThe other terms in the expression provide additional context:\n*   `alpha^3` and `g^2` are coupling constants, indicating the strength and types of interactions. Their powers suggest a complex diagram with multiple interaction points (vertices). A three-loop diagram is consistent with such a high-order expression in the coupling constants.\n*   The numerical factors `sqrt(2)` and `8` typically arise from symmetries of the diagram and conventions used in the calculation.\n*   `(Q/M)^2` is a ratio of energy scales squared, which results from the evaluation of the loop integrals.\n\nBased on the `1/(4pi)^6` factor, the diagram must have contained three loops.\n\n<<<A>>>"
