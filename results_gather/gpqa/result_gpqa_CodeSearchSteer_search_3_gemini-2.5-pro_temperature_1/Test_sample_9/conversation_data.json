    "Here is the step-by-step analysis to determine which exoplanet has the highest density:\n\n1.  **Analyze Planet (a):** This is a planet with the same mass and radius as Earth. Therefore, its density is equal to Earth's density, which is approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n2.  **Analyze Planet (b):** This planet has a mass of two Earths, and its density is explicitly stated as approximately 5.5 g/cm³. This is very close to Earth's density.\n\n3.  **Analyze Planet (c):** This planet has the same composition as Earth but is five times more massive. For planets with the same composition, an increase in mass leads to stronger gravitational compression. This compression reduces the planet's size relative to its mass, thereby increasing its overall density. Consequently, this planet will be significantly denser than Earth.\n\n4.  **Analyze Planet (d):** This planet also has the same composition as Earth but is only half as massive. Due to lower mass, gravitational compression will be weaker. As a result, it will be less dense than Earth.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Planet (a) and Planet (b) have densities approximately equal to Earth's (~5.5 g/cm³).\n*   Planet (d) is less massive and therefore less dense than Earth.\n*   Planet (c) is more massive and, due to gravitational compression, is denser than Earth.\n\nBy comparing the options, the planet that is five times more massive than Earth but with the same composition (c) will have the highest density.\n\n<<<B>>>"
