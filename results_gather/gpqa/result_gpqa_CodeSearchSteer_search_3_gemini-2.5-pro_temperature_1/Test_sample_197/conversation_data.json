    "To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], in the solution, we need to calculate the mole fraction of this species relative to all cobalt-containing species.\n\nThe formation of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes is governed by the following equilibria and their overall stability constants (β):\n*   Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺ ; β₁ = 9\n*   Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂] ; β₂ = 40\n*   Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ ; β₃ = 63\n*   Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ ; β₄ = 16\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of the free Co²⁺ ion and all its complexes:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\nThe concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration, [Co²⁺], the thiocyanate concentration, [SCN⁻], and the stability constants. Since the total cobalt concentration (10⁻² M) is much lower than the thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M), we can assume the equilibrium concentration of thiocyanate is approximately its initial concentration, so [SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M.\n\nThe mole fraction (αₙ) of each species is given by the formula:\nαₙ = (βₙ[SCN⁻]ⁿ) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nWe are interested in the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], which corresponds to n=2.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the denominator (often denoted as Φ):\nΦ = 1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴\nΦ = 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.1²) + (63 * 0.1³) + (16 * 0.1⁴)\nΦ = 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.01) + (63 * 0.001) + (16 * 0.0001)\nΦ = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016\nΦ = 2.3646\n\nNext, we calculate the numerator term for the dithiocyanato complex:\nNumerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n\nNow, we can find the mole fraction (α₂) of [Co(SCN)₂]:\nα₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\nPercentage of [Co(SCN)₂] = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%\n\nThe calculation confirms that the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is approximately 16.9%. While various cobalt thiocyanate complexes can be blue, the question specifically asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato species.\n\n<<<D>>>"
