    "Based on the detailed analysis of the provided spectroscopic data, the unknown compound is identified as **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. Here is a breakdown of how the data supports this conclusion:\n\n### 1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation:** The formula indicates 5 degrees of unsaturation. This is consistent with a benzene ring (4 degrees) and one additional double bond, such as a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectrum Analysis\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** These two medium-to-strong bands are highly characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂) group.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch, specifically in the range for an ester.\n\n### 3. ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectrum Analysis\n*   **Aromatic Region (7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm):** The presence of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, is a classic pattern for a para- (1,4-) disubstituted benzene ring. The significant difference in chemical shift between the two doublets suggests one substituent is electron-donating (shielding the protons, moving them upfield to ~7.0 ppm) and the other is electron-withdrawing (deshielding the protons, moving them downfield to ~8.0 ppm). The amino group (-NH₂) is donating, and the ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃) is withdrawing, which perfectly fits this observation.\n*   **Ethyl Group (1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm):**\n    *   The triplet at **1.20 ppm (3H)** corresponds to a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   The quartet at **4.5 ppm (2H)** corresponds to a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to a methyl group. The downfield shift to 4.5 ppm is indicative of the methylene group being attached to an electronegative oxygen atom, confirming the presence of an ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃) as part of an ester.\n*   **Amine Protons (4.0 ppm):** The broad singlet at **4.0 ppm integrating to 2H** is consistent with the two protons of the primary amine (-NH₂) group identified in the IR spectrum. The broadness is due to chemical exchange and quadrupole broadening from the nitrogen atom.\n\n### Conclusion by Evaluating the Options:\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure contains a para-substituted benzene ring, a primary amine, and an ethyl ester group. All features perfectly match the IR and ¹H NMR data. Spectroscopic data for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (also known as Benzocaine) confirms these spectral features.\n*   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR and one N-H proton in the ¹H NMR.\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a meta-substituted compound, which would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the ¹H NMR, not two clean doublets.\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** In this isomer, the quartet for the -CH₂- group would be adjacent to the carbonyl, shifting its signal to a much more upfield position (around 2.2-2.6 ppm), which contradicts the observed shift at 4.5 ppm.\n\nTherefore, all the provided evidence points unequivocally to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
