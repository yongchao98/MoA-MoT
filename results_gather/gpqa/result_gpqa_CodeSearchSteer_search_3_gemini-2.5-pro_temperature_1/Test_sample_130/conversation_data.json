    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n**1. Identification of Reactants and Reaction:**\n*   The problem describes the dehydration of a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid to an anhydride. The anhydride's spectroscopic data (¹H NMR: one peak at 7 ppm; ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) are characteristic of **maleic anhydride**. The single proton peak corresponds to the two equivalent alkene protons, and the two carbon peaks correspond to the two equivalent alkene carbons and the two equivalent carbonyl carbons.\n*   This anhydride reacts with **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, which forms a bicyclic adduct.\n\n**2. Determination of the Major and Minor Products:**\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n*   Generally, the *endo* product is favored kinetically due to secondary orbital interactions. However, significant steric hindrance can cause the more sterically stable *exo* product to be favored.\n*   In this specific reaction, the diene has four bulky methyl groups. These groups create substantial steric hindrance, which overrides the normal *endo* preference. Consequently, the **exo adduct is the major product**, and the *endo* adduct is the minor product.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Product Structures and NOESY Spectra:**\n*   A 2D NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (typically less than 5 Å apart). The problem states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major product's spectrum but absent or weak in the minor product's spectrum. We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *exo* adduct (major) and far apart in the *endo* adduct (minor).\n\n*   **Signal Assignment:**\n    *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** These are the two equivalent protons on the anhydride part of the molecule (let's call them H_anhydride).\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** These are one pair of equivalent methyl groups. Given their chemical shift, they are likely the methyl groups attached to the double bond of the bicyclic system (Me_alkene).\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1 ppm:** This is the other pair of equivalent methyl groups, located at the bridgehead positions (Me_bridgehead).\n    *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This signal corresponds to one of the two non-equivalent protons of the CH₂ bridge.\n\n*   **Spatial Proximity in the Isomers:**\n    *   **In the *exo* adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is oriented away from the one-carbon (CH₂) bridge and toward the C=C double bond. This places the H_anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm) in close proximity to the Me_alkene groups (~1.7 ppm). Therefore, a strong NOESY cross-peak between these two signals is expected.\n    *   **In the *endo* adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is oriented toward the CH₂ bridge and away from the C=C double bond. This makes the distance between the H_anhydride protons and the Me_alkene groups large. Thus, the corresponding NOESY cross-peak would be absent or very weak.\n\n**4. Conclusion:**\nThe cross-peak that is present in the major (*exo*) product and absent in the minor (*endo*) product is between the anhydride protons and the alkene methyl groups. This corresponds to the resonances at ~3.5 ppm (2H singlet) and ~1.7 ppm (6H singlet).\n\nTherefore, the correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
