    "To determine by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, we can use the principles of orbital mechanics applied to binary star systems. For a double-lined spectroscopic binary, where the radial velocities of both stars can be measured, the total mass of the system is related to the orbital period and the radial velocity amplitudes.\n\nThe problem states that both systems are eclipsing, which implies that their orbital planes are viewed nearly edge-on. This simplifies the calculations, as we can assume the inclination angle is 90 degrees.\n\nThe formula for the total mass (M) of an eclipsing binary system is given by:\n\nM_total = (P / (2πG)) * (K₁ + K₂)^3\n\nWhere:\n*   P is the orbital period.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n*   K₁ and K₂ are the amplitudes of the radial velocities for the two stars.\n\nWe can set up a ratio of the masses of the two systems, M₁ / M₂. The constant term (1 / (2πG)) will cancel out, leaving the following relationship:\n\nM₁ / M₂ = (P₁ * (K₁ₐ + K₁ₑ)³) / (P₂ * (K₂ₐ + K₂ₑ)³)\n\nNow, we can substitute the given values for each system:\n\n**For System 1:**\n*   Period (P₁) = 2 years\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K₁ₐ + K₁ₑ) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n**For System 2:**\n*   Period (P₂) = 1 year\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K₂ₐ + K₂ₑ) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nPlugging these values into the ratio equation:\n\nM₁ / M₂ = (2 * (15)³) / (1 * (25)³)\nM₁ / M₂ = 2 * (3375) / (15625)\nM₁ / M₂ = 6750 / 15625\n\nSimplifying the fraction:\n\nM₁ / M₂ = 2 * (15/25)³\nM₁ / M₂ = 2 * (3/5)³\nM₁ / M₂ = 2 * (27 / 125)\nM₁ / M₂ = 54 / 125\nM₁ / M₂ = 0.432\n\nThe calculated mass ratio of system_1 to system_2 is approximately 0.432. This value is closest to the provided option of ~0.4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
