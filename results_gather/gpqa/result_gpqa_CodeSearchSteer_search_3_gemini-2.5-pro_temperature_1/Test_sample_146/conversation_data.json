    "To solve this problem, we will use the principles of conservation of energy and momentum. The annihilation process is given by:\n\n$p+\\bar{p}\\rightarrow2A^{+}+2A^{-}$\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1.  **Initial State Analysis**: The problem states that a proton ($p$) and a \"slowly moving\" antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) annihilate. The term \"slowly moving\" implies that the kinetic energy of the antiproton is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. Therefore, we can approximate both the proton and the antiproton as being at rest before the annihilation.\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum**: Since both particles are effectively at rest, the total initial momentum of the system is zero. To conserve momentum, the total momentum of the four resulting 'A' particles must also be zero.\n    *   **Conservation of Energy**: The total initial energy is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton. The rest mass energy of a proton is approximately 938.3 MeV. An antiproton has the same rest mass.\n\n2.  **Final State Analysis**: The annihilation produces four particles, two $A^{+}$ and two $A^{-}$, all with the same mass $m_{A}$. The problem gives the rest mass energy of particle A as $m_{A}c^{2}=300$ MeV.\n    *   Because the total initial momentum is zero, the four final particles must share the total initial energy equally, and they will all have the same speed, *v*.\n\n3.  **Applying Conservation of Energy**: The total initial energy must equal the total final energy.\n    *   Initial Energy ($E_i$): $E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times (m_p c^2)$\n    *   Final Energy ($E_f$): The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the four 'A' particles. The total energy of a single moving particle is given by the relativistic formula $E = \\gamma m c^2$, where $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n        $E_f = 4 \\times (\\gamma m_A c^2)$\n\n4.  **Calculation**:\n    *   Set $E_i = E_f$:\n        $2 \\times (m_p c^2) = 4 \\times (\\gamma m_A c^2)$\n    *   Plug in the known values: $m_p c^2 = 938.3$ MeV and $m_A c^2 = 300$ MeV.\n        $2 \\times 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times 300 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   Solve for $\\gamma$:\n        $1876.6 = 1200 \\gamma$\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{1876.6}{1200} \\approx 1.5638$\n    *   Now, solve for the velocity *v* using the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n        $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n        $1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}}$\n        $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}}$\n        $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089}$\n        $v/c = \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n        $v/c \\approx 0.7688$\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: The velocity of particle A is approximately 0.77 times the speed of light (c). Comparing this result to the given options:\n    A) 0.96c\n    B) 0.77c\n    C) 0.86c\n    D) 0.91c\n\nThe calculated velocity matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
