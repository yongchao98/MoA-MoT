    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻).\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the initial molar concentrations of the buffer components.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of moles for each component:\n\n*   **Moles of KH₂PO₄:**\n    *   Mass = 1.00 g\n    *   Molar Mass (Mw) = 136.09 g/mol\n    *   Moles = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 moles of H₂PO₄⁻\n\n*   **Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O:**\n    *   Mass = 1.00 g\n    *   Molar Mass (Mw) = 177.99 g/mol\n    *   Moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 moles of HPO₄²⁻\n\nNext, we calculate the molar concentration of each ion in the 200.00 cm³ (0.200 L) solution:\n\n*   **Concentration of [H₂PO₄⁻]:**\n    *   [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M\n\n*   **Concentration of [HPO₄²⁻]:**\n    *   [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M\n\n### Step 2: Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺].\n\nThe solution is a buffer system composed of the weak acid H₂PO₄⁻ and its conjugate base HPO₄²⁻. The relevant equilibrium is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄), which has an equilibrium constant Kₐ₂.\n\nThe equilibrium reaction is:\nH₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n\nThe equilibrium expression is:\nKₐ₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for [H⁺]:\n[H⁺] = Kₐ₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n\nUsing the given values:\n[H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n[H⁺] ≈ 8.109 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the orthophosphate ion [PO₄³⁻] concentration.\n\nThe orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is formed from the dissociation of HPO₄²⁻. This corresponds to the third dissociation step of phosphoric acid, governed by Kₐ₃.\n\nThe equilibrium reaction is:\nHPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n\nThe equilibrium expression is:\nKₐ₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n\nWe can now solve for the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, [PO₄³⁻]:\n[PO₄³⁻] = Kₐ₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n\nUsing the calculated values and the given Kₐ₃:\n[PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.109 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n[PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.235 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThis result is very close to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
