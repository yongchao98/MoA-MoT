    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the FTIR Spectrum\n\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration found in a carboxylic acid. The significant broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When seen with a broad O-H peak, it strongly suggests the C=O of a carboxylic acid (1760-1690 cm⁻¹).\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch (1680-1640 cm⁻¹).\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) and a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n\n### 2. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the spectrum, typically in the 4.5-6.5 ppm chemical shift range, confirms the existence of an alkene group.\n\n**Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** This corroborates the FTIR data, confirming the presence of a C=C double bond.\n\n### 3. Analysis of the Mass Spectrum\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids, corresponding to the [COOH]⁺ cation. It can also arise from other structures, but in the context of the FTIR data, the carboxylic acid fragment is the most logical conclusion.\n\n**Conclusion from Mass Spectrometry:** The data strongly supports the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n\n### 4. Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nThe degree of unsaturation indicates the total number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2). Let's calculate it for the given options:\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = **2**\n*   **B) C₆H₁₂O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = **1**\n*   **C) C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = **1**\n*   **D) C₆H₁₀O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = **2**\n\nThe combined spectroscopic evidence points to a molecule containing one carboxylic acid group (which includes one C=O double bond) and one C=C double bond. Each double bond accounts for one degree of unsaturation. Therefore, the molecule must have a total of **two degrees of unsaturation**.\n\n### 5. Final Identification\n\n*   We need a formula with a DoU of 2 and two oxygen atoms to account for the carboxylic acid.\n*   **C₆H₁₀O₂** has a DoU of 2 and contains two oxygens. This fits all the spectral evidence.\n*   **C₆H₁₂O** is eliminated because it only has one oxygen and a DoU of 1.\n*   **C₆H₁₂O₂** is eliminated because it has a DoU of 1, which is not enough to account for both a C=O and a C=C bond.\n*   **C₆H₁₀O** is eliminated because, while it has a DoU of 2, it only has one oxygen and cannot be a carboxylic acid.\n\nThe only formula that accommodates all the experimental evidence—a carboxylic acid group, a C=C double bond, and the corresponding degree of unsaturation—is **C₆H₁₀O₂**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
