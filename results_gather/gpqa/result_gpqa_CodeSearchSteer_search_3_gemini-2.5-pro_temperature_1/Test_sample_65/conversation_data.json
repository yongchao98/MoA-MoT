    "The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model Lagrangian. These operators are built from the Standard Model fields and must respect certain fundamental symmetries.\n\n*   **Lorentz and Poincare Symmetry:** SMEFT is a local quantum field theory, and as such, it must be invariant under Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts) and, more generally, Poincare transformations (which also include spacetime translations). These symmetries are foundational to the structure of spacetime in which the theory is defined.\n\n*   **CPT Symmetry:** The CPT theorem states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be CPT (Charge-Parity-Time Reversal) invariant. Since SMEFT adheres to these principles, its operators must respect CPT symmetry. A violation of CPT would imply a violation of Lorentz invariance.\n\n*   **CP Symmetry:** CP (Charge-Parity) symmetry is known to be violated in the Standard Model itself. SMEFT, as an extension, not only incorporates this violation but can also introduce new sources of CP violation through higher-dimensional operators. Therefore, SMEFT operators are not required to respect CP symmetry.\n\nBased on this, all operators in the SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry.\n\n<<<A>>>"
