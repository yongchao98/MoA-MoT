    "In our universe, one of the fundamental principles of magnetism is that magnetic poles always come in pairs: a north and a south. An isolated magnetic pole, or a magnetic monopole, has never been observed. This empirical fact is embedded in Maxwell's equations, the set of foundational equations for electromagnetism.\n\nIf a magnetic monopole were discovered, two of Maxwell's equations would need to be modified to account for it.\n\n**The affected equations would be:**\n\n*   **Gauss's Law for Magnetism (related to the divergence of the magnetic field):** In its current form, this law states that the divergence of the magnetic field (∇ · B) is zero. This is the mathematical statement that there are no magnetic \"charges\" or monopoles. If monopoles existed, they would act as sources or sinks for magnetic field lines, just as electric charges do for electric field lines. The equation would be changed to show that the divergence of the magnetic field is proportional to the density of magnetic charge (ρ‎m).\n\n*   **Faraday's Law of Induction (related to the circulation of the electric field):** This law describes how a changing magnetic field creates a circulating electric field (∇ × E). To make the equations fully symmetric, the existence of magnetic monopoles implies that their movement would constitute a \"magnetic current\" (Jm). This magnetic current would also act as a source for a circulating electric field, requiring a new term to be added to Faraday's Law.\n\nTherefore, the two equations that would change are the ones related to the divergence of the magnetic field and the circulation (or curl) of the electric field.\n\n<<<C>>>"
