    "The problem describes a classic scenario in special relativity involving particle decay and time dilation. The survival probability of a particle traveling a certain distance depends on its speed, or more precisely, its Lorentz factor (γ).\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Understanding Particle Decay:** The decay of unstable particles is an exponential process. The fraction of particles, P, that survive after a time *t* in their own rest frame is given by P = e^(-t/τ), where τ is the proper mean lifetime of the particle.\n\n2.  **Time Dilation:** According to special relativity, time for a moving particle, as observed from a stationary frame (the lab frame), appears to run slower. This effect is called time dilation. The particle's lifetime in the lab frame (t') is dilated by the Lorentz factor, γ: t' = γτ. This means the particle's average decay length in the lab is L = vγτ, where v is its velocity.\n\n3.  **Applying to the Problem:**\n    *   The particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" so their velocity *v* is approximately the speed of light, *c*.\n    *   The time it takes to travel from the center to the detector wall (a distance R = 30 m) in the lab frame is t_lab = R/v ≈ R/c.\n    *   The survival probability, P, is the probability that the particle survives for at least the time t_lab. This is given by the formula P = e^(-t_lab / t') = e^(-(R/c) / (γτ)).\n\n4.  **Setting up the Equations:** We have two scenarios:\n\n    *   **Scenario 1:** Lorentz factor γ₁ = 20, and the survival fraction P₁ = 1/3.\n        1/3 = e^(-R / (γ₁cτ)) = e^(-30 / (20cτ))\n\n    *   **Scenario 2:** A new Lorentz factor γ₂ is needed for a survival fraction P₂ = 2/3.\n        2/3 = e^(-R / (γ₂cτ)) = e^(-30 / (γ₂cτ))\n\n5.  **Solving for the Unknown Lorentz Factor (γ₂):** To solve for γ₂, we can take the natural logarithm of both equations:\n\n    *   ln(1/3) = -30 / (20cτ)  =>  -ln(3) = -30 / (20cτ)  =>  ln(3) = 1.5 / (cτ)\n    *   ln(2/3) = -30 / (γ₂cτ)  =>  -ln(3/2) = -30 / (γ₂cτ) => ln(3/2) = 30 / (γ₂cτ)\n\n    Now, we can create a ratio of the two results to eliminate the unknown particle lifetime (τ) and the speed of light (c):\n\n    (ln(3)) / (ln(3/2)) = (1.5 / cτ) / (30 / (γ₂cτ))\n    (ln(3)) / (ln(3/2)) = (1.5 * γ₂) / 30\n    (ln(3)) / (ln(3/2)) = γ₂ / 20\n\n    Finally, we solve for γ₂:\n\n    γ₂ = 20 * [ln(3) / ln(3/2)]\n    γ₂ ≈ 20 * [1.0986 / 0.4055]\n    γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709\n    γ₂ ≈ 54.18\n\nThis result is very close to 54.\n\n<<<B>>>"
