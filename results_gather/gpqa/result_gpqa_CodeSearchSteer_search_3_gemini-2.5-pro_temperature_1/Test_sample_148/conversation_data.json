    "Here is an analysis of the provided experimental data and options:\n\n### Analysis of the Observations\n\n1.  **¹H NMR Data:** The spectrum shows two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton. Since they have roughly equal integrals that sum to one proton, it indicates the presence of two different species in an approximate 1:1 ratio. Each species contains that specific alpha-proton, but in a slightly different chemical environment, leading to different chemical shifts. Spin-spin coupling has been ruled out as the cause.\n2.  **LC-MS Data:** The liquid chromatography (LC) shows two separate peaks, confirming the presence of two distinct compounds that can be separated based on their physical properties. The mass spectrometry (MS) data shows that both of these separated compounds have the identical mass, and this mass corresponds to the expected product.\n\n### Evaluation of the Options\n\n*   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n    *   **Consistency with NMR:** Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images. They have different physical and chemical properties. In an NMR spectrometer (an achiral environment), diastereomers are chemically non-equivalent and are expected to produce different signals. Therefore, the alpha-proton in each diastereomer would have a unique chemical shift, resulting in two peaks, which is consistent with the observation. The equal integrals suggest a roughly 1:1 mixture of the two diastereomers.\n    *   **Consistency with LC-MS:** Because diastereomers have different physical properties, they can be separated by standard (achiral) liquid chromatography. This would result in two distinct peaks in the LC chromatogram. Since they are isomers, they have the same molecular formula and thus the same mass, which is consistent with both LC peaks giving the identical mass spectrum.\n    *   **Plausibility in Synthesis:** In peptide synthesis, epimerization (the change in configuration at one chiral center) is a known side reaction that converts the desired product into its diastereomer. Another possibility is the presence of stable *cis-trans* isomers around a peptide bond (especially involving proline), which are also a form of diastereomers. These isomers are often stable enough to be observed as separate species in both NMR and chromatography.\n\n*   **B) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:**\n    *   This would result in a molecule with a higher mass than the expected product. This is inconsistent with the LC-MS data, which shows both peaks having the *expected* mass.\n\n*   **C) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:**\n    *   A precursor would be a different chemical entity, likely with a different molecular weight (e.g., a starting material or a shorter peptide fragment). This contradicts the MS data showing both peaks have the same, expected mass.\n\n*   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n    *   **Inconsistency with NMR:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard, achiral NMR solvent, they are indistinguishable and give the exact same NMR spectrum. One would see a single set of peaks, not two peaks for the same proton. Distinguishing enantiomers requires a chiral solvent or a chiral derivatizing agent.\n    *   **Inconsistency with LC:** Standard LC uses an achiral stationary phase and cannot separate enantiomers; they would elute together as a single peak. Separating enantiomers requires a specialized chiral column. The observation of two clearly defined peaks on a standard LC system rules out enantiomers.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe observation of two distinct chemical species that are separable by LC but have the same mass points directly to the presence of isomers. The fact that these isomers are distinguishable in a standard ¹H NMR spectrum confirms they are diastereomers. This scenario commonly arises in peptide synthesis through either epimerization or *cis-trans* isomerism. Therefore, the presence of a diastereomeric mixture is the most likely explanation for all the provided data.\n\n<<<A>>>"
