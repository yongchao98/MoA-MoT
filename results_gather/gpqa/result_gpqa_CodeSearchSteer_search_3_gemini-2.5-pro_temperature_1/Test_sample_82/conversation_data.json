    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.\n\n### Summary of Initial Conditions:\n*   **Analyte:** 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n*   **Dilution:** Addition of 20.00 cm³ of water.\n*   **Titrant:** 0.1 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n*   **Acid Dissociation Constant (Ka) for CH₃COOH:** 1.85 x 10⁻⁵.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Concentration of the Diluted Acetic Acid\n\nFirst, we determine the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted with water.\n*   **Initial moles of acetic acid:**\n    Volume × Molarity = 0.02000 L × 0.05 mol/L = 0.001 mol\n*   **Total volume after dilution:**\n    20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³ = 0.04000 L\n*   **Concentration of diluted acetic acid ([CH₃COOH]):**\n    Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.04000 L = 0.025 M\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the pH at 25% Titration\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the initial acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH, forming its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). The solution now contains a mixture of a weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻), which constitutes a buffer.\n\n1.  **Determine moles:**\n    *   Moles of CH₃COO⁻ formed = 25% of 0.001 mol = 0.00025 mol\n    *   Moles of CH₃COOH remaining = 75% of 0.001 mol = 0.00075 mol\n\n2.  **Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation:**\n    The pH of a buffer solution can be calculated using this equation: pH = pKa + log(\\[A⁻]/\\[HA]), where \\[A⁻] is the concentration of the conjugate base and \\[HA] is the concentration of the weak acid.\n\n    *   **Calculate pKa:**\n        pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n    *   **Calculate pH:**\n        The ratio of concentrations is equal to the ratio of moles since they are in the same volume.\n        pH = 4.73 + log(0.00025 / 0.00075)\n        pH = 4.73 + log(1/3)\n        pH = 4.73 - 0.48\n        pH ≈ 4.25\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the pH is **4.26**.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the pH at the Equivalence Point\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH to form sodium acetate (NaCH₃COO). The resulting solution contains the conjugate base of a weak acid, which will hydrolyze water to produce hydroxide ions (OH⁻), making the solution basic.\n\n1.  **Determine the volume of NaOH added:**\n    *   Moles of NaOH needed = Moles of CH₃COOH = 0.001 mol\n    *   Volume of NaOH = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³\n\n2.  **Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion ([CH₃COO⁻]):**\n    *   **Total volume:** 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.05000 L\n    *   **Moles of acetate formed:** 0.001 mol\n    *   **[CH₃COO⁻]:** 0.001 mol / 0.05000 L = 0.02 M\n\n3.  **Calculate the pOH from the hydrolysis of acetate:**\n    The reaction is: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n\n    *   **Calculate Kb for acetate:**\n        Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n    *   **Calculate [OH⁻]:**\n        Kb = \\[CH₃COOH]\\[OH⁻] / \\[CH₃COO⁻] = x² / (0.02 - x)\n        Assuming x is small, we can simplify: x² ≈ Kb × 0.02\n        x² ≈ (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 ≈ 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n        x = \\[OH⁻] ≈ √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n    *   **Calculate pOH:**\n        pOH = -log(\\[OH⁻]) = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n\n4.  **Calculate the pH:**\n    At 25°C, pH + pOH = 14.\n    pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.48 ≈ 8.52\n\nThe pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated pH values are approximately 4.26 at 25% titration and 8.52 at the equivalence point.\n\n<<<A>>>"
