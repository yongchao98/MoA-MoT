    "Here is the step-by-step analysis of the reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type**: This is a Michael addition reaction.\n    *   **Michael Donor**: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), will remove an acidic alpha-proton to form an enolate.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor**: Ethyl acrylate, an α,β-unsaturated ester.\n    *   **Base**: Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, sterically hindered base.\n\n2.  **Enolate Formation**: The ketone has two alpha-carbons, C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, C1, and C3) and has no alpha-protons.\n    *   C6 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to a methyl group, a hydrogen, C1, and C5) and has one acidic alpha-proton.\n    *   The t-BuOK base will abstract the only available alpha-proton from C6 to form the enolate.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: The resulting enolate is a nucleophile. It will attack the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate in a conjugate addition.\n\n4.  **Product Formation**: A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate. After protonation (usually from the solvent or during workup), the final product is formed.\n\n5.  **Product Structure and Naming**:\n    *   The product has the ethyl propanoate group (`-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt`) attached to the C6 position of the original ketone.\n    *   The IUPAC naming for such a complex molecule can be approached by treating the larger cyclohexanone ring as a substituent on the propanoate chain.\n    *   Let's analyze the name `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`:\n        *   `ethyl ... propanoate`: This indicates the `CH₂CH₂COOEt` chain.\n        *   The cyclohexyl group is a substituent attached at position 3 of the propanoate chain.\n        *   To name the cyclohexyl substituent, we number its ring starting from the point of attachment as C1.\n        *   C1 (formerly C6 of the ketone) has a methyl group.\n        *   C2 (formerly C1 of the ketone) has the oxo (=O) group.\n        *   C3 (formerly C2 of the ketone) has an ethyl and a methyl group.\n        *   This matches the name: `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   Therefore, product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type**: This is a nitro-Michael addition.\n    *   **Michael Donor**: 1-nitropropane (`CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂`). The alpha-carbon (C1) has acidic protons due to the electron-withdrawing nitro group.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor**: (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, `CH₃CH=CH-CN`).\n    *   **Base**: Potassium hydroxide (KOH) is the base used to deprotonate the 1-nitropropane.\n\n2.  **Carbanion Formation**: KOH removes a proton from the carbon adjacent to the nitro group in 1-nitropropane, forming a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate).\n    `CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂ + KOH → CH₃CH₂CH⁻NO₂ K⁺ + H₂O`\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: The nitronate attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`\n    The carbanion `CH₃CH₂CH⁻NO₂` attacks the β-carbon.\n\n4.  **Product Formation**: A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the alpha-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the beta-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile. Subsequent protonation by water yields the final product.\n\n5.  **Product Structure and Naming**:\n    *   The resulting structure is `NC-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(NO₂)-CH₂-CH₃`.\n    *   To name this product according to IUPAC rules, we find the longest carbon chain that includes the principal functional group (the nitrile, -CN).\n    *   The longest chain has 6 carbons, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1: `¹(CN)-²(CH₂)-³(CH)-⁴(CH)-⁵(CH₂)-⁶(CH₃)`.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   Thus, the correct IUPAC name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   The major product for reaction A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   The major product for reaction B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options, the correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
