    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the required minimum resolution:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Physics\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the distance the particle $X^0$ travels in the bubble chamber (the lab frame) before it decays. This distance is known as the decay length. Due to relativistic effects, a fast-moving particle's lifetime is extended in the lab frame through time dilation.\n\n*   **Proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$)**: The lifetime of the particle in its own rest frame, given as $8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s.\n*   **Lab frame lifetime ($\\tau$)**: The lifetime as observed in the bubble chamber. It is longer than the proper lifetime by a factor of $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor).\n*   **Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**: The average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying. It is calculated as $\\lambda = v \\cdot \\tau$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity.\n\nThe probability that a particle travels a distance *x* before decaying follows an exponential decay law: $P(x) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda}e^{-x/\\lambda}$.\n\n### 2. Calculation Steps\n\n**a. Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**\n\nThe Lorentz factor relates the particle's total energy (E) to its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$).\n\n*   Energy $E = 27$ GeV\n*   Rest Mass $m_0 = 3.41$ GeV/$c^2$ (Note: Particle mass is often given in units of GeV, which implicitly means GeV/$c^2$)\n\nThe Lorentz factor is given by:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\n**b. Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**\n\nThe mean decay length can be calculated using the formula $\\lambda = \\frac{p}{m_0} c \\tau_0$, where *p* is the particle's momentum. We first find the momentum using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n\n*   $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = (27 \\text{ GeV})^2 - (3.41 \\text{ GeV})^2 = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 \\text{ GeV}^2$\n*   $pc = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nNow, we can calculate the decay length $\\lambda$:\n$\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c \\cdot \\tau_0$\n$\\lambda = \\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\cdot (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n$\\lambda \\approx 7.8545 \\cdot (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n**c. Determine the Required Resolution**\n\nTo \"observe\" a decay, the particle's track must be distinguishable before it decays. This means the particle must travel a distance *L* that is at least as long as the detector's resolution, *d*. The problem requires that we observe at least 30% of the decays. This translates to the condition that the probability of the decay length *L* being greater than or equal to the resolution *d* must be at least 0.3.\n\nThe probability of a particle traveling a distance of at least *d* is:\n$P(L \\ge d) = e^{-d/\\lambda}$\n\nWe set this to be greater than or equal to 30%:\n$e^{-d/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n\nTo solve for *d*, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$-d/\\lambda \\ge \\ln(0.30)$\n$d \\le -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n$d \\le -\\lambda \\cdot (-1.204)$\n$d \\le 1.204 \\cdot \\lambda$\n\nSubstituting the value of $\\lambda$:\n$d \\le 1.204 \\cdot (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m})$\n$d \\le 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\nThis result means the resolution *d* must be smaller than or equal to $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The question asks for the minimum resolution needed, which in this context means the coarsest resolution (largest *d*) that still satisfies the condition.\n\n### 3. Conclusion\n\nThe calculated maximum allowable resolution is $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. Looking at the options provided:\n\nA) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\nB) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\nC) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\nD) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\nOption (D) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m is the only value that is close to and satisfies the condition ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6} m \\le 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} m$). The small discrepancy between the calculated value and the option is likely due to rounding in the problem's given values. With a resolution of $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, the fraction of observed decays would be $e^{-2.08/1.885} \\approx 0.33$, which is greater than 30%.\n\n<<<D>>>"
