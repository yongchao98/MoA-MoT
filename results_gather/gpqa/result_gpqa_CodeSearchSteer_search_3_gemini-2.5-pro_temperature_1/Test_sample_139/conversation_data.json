    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical riddle and arrive at the final answer.\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The melting point of B is very close to 277 K (3.85 °C). This is the well-known melting point of heavy water (D₂O). The \"normal conditions\" melting point of regular water is 273.15 K (0 °C).\n\n2.  **Identify Substance X and the Heavier Isotope:** Since a product of a subsequent reaction is heavy water (D₂O), the heavier isotope mentioned in the first clue must be deuterium (D or ²H). This implies that Substance X contains deuterium. The clue that \"X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\" points strongly to Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄), a powerful and common reducing agent. Its \"very close analog\" containing the heavier isotope is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride, **LiAlD₄**. This is our Substance X. It is a powerful reducing agent known for its violent reactions, especially with water.\n\n3.  **Identify Liquid Y and Gas W:** Substance X (LiAlD₄) reacts violently with a liquid Y to produce a gas W and a precipitate G. The most logical violent reaction for a metal hydride is with water. Given the context of deuterium, liquid Y is likely heavy water (D₂O).\n    *   **Reaction:** LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂\n    *   **Gas W:** The gas produced is D₂ (deuterium gas). Let's check if it fits the description: \"a gas whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons\". A D₂ molecule consists of two deuterium atoms. Each deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This matches the clue perfectly. Other common molecules like N₂, O₂, and CO₂ also have this property, but D₂ is the most logical product in this specific reaction.\n\n4.  **Identify Precipitate G:** In the reaction above, Lithium Deuteroxide (LiOD) is soluble, but Aluminum Deuteroxide, **Al(OD)₃**, would form a precipitate, analogous to Aluminum Hydroxide, Al(OH)₃. So, G is Al(OD)₃.\n\n5.  **Confirm the Decomposition of G:** The clue states that when precipitate G is heated, it releases B.\n    *   **Reaction:** Heating Aluminum Hydroxide causes it to decompose into aluminum oxide and water: 2Al(OH)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3H₂O.\n    *   Therefore, heating G (Al(OD)₃) would yield: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O.\n    *   This reaction releases **D₂O**, which we've identified as substance B. This confirms the entire reaction sequence.\n\n6.  **Verify the Final Clue:** \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n    *   Substance X (LiAlD₄) is a strong reducing agent.\n    *   A keto acid contains both a ketone group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). An example is pyruvic acid (CH₃COCOOH), which has three oxygen atoms.\n    *   LiAlH₄ (and by extension LiAlD₄) reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols.\n    *   The ketone is reduced to a secondary alcohol (-CH(OH)-), and the carboxylic acid is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n    *   So, pyruvic acid would be reduced to 1,2-propanediol (CH₃CH(OH)CH₂OH). This resulting molecule contains exactly two oxygen atoms, satisfying the clue.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses:** The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄), summing all instances.\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li, atomic number 3), Aluminum (Al, atomic number 13), and Hydrogen (as Deuterium, D, atomic number 1).\n    *   **Lightest element:** Hydrogen (as Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Heaviest element:** Aluminum (Al).\n    *   The formula LiAlD₄ contains one atom of the heaviest element (Al) and four atoms of the lightest element (D).\n    *   We need the atomic mass of the specific isotopes: ²⁷Al and ²H (Deuterium).\n    *   Atomic mass of ²⁷Al ≈ 26.9815 u.\n    *   Atomic mass of ²H (Deuterium) ≈ 2.0141 u.\n    *   **Calculation:**\n        *   Total mass of the heaviest element (Aluminum): 1 × 26.9815 u = 26.9815 u\n        *   Total mass of the lightest element (Deuterium): 4 × 2.0141 u = 8.0564 u\n        *   Cumulative mass = 26.9815 + 8.0564 = 35.0379 u\n\n8.  **Final Answer:** The calculated cumulative atomic mass is approximately 35. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
