    "To determine the correct starting materials, we must analyze the two reactions and the selectivity of the reducing agents involved.\n\n**The Product and Starting Material Structures**\n\n*   **Product:** The reactions produce (R)- and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a lactone, which is a cyclic ester formed from a molecule containing both a carboxylic acid and an alcohol group. The chiral center is the carbon at position 4, which bears the ethyl group.\n*   **Starting Material:** The proposed starting materials are (R)- or (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule is a derivative of a dicarboxylic acid where one acid group is free (-COOH) and the other is an isobutyl ester (-COO-iBu). The chiral center is the carbon at position 3, which has the ethyl group.\n\n**Analyzing the Reactions and Reagent Selectivity**\n\nThe formation of the lactone product requires one of the carbonyl groups in the starting material to be reduced to an alcohol, followed by cyclization (lactonization). The key to this problem lies in the different chemoselectivities of the two reducing agents, borane (BH₃) and lithium borohydride (LiBH₄).\n\n*   **Reaction with BH₃ (Borane):** Borane is well-known for its high selectivity in reducing carboxylic acids much more rapidly than esters. In the presence of both functional groups, BH₃ will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid (-COOH) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n*   **Reaction with LiBH₄ (Lithium Borohydride):** Lithium borohydride is a stronger reducing agent than sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) and is capable of reducing esters. Crucially, LiBH₄ is commonly used for the selective reduction of esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n\n**Step-by-Step Derivation**\n\n1.  **Reaction 2 (Compound B + BH₃):**\n    *   Reagent: BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid.\n    *   Reaction: The -COOH group of compound B is reduced to a -CH₂OH group, leaving the isobutyl ester group intact.\n    *   Intermediate: This forms a 5-hydroxy ester.\n    *   Cyclization: Under acidic workup (H⁺), the newly formed alcohol group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol and forming the lactone.\n    *   Stereochemistry: This sequence of reactions (reduction and lactonization) does not affect the existing stereocenter at position 3 of the starting material, which becomes position 4 in the lactone product. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the product is the same as the starting material.\n    *   Conclusion: Since the product is **(S)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n2.  **Reaction 1 (Compound A + LiBH₄):**\n    *   Reagent: LiBH₄ selectively reduces the ester.\n    *   Reaction: The isobutyl ester group of compound A is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), leaving the carboxylic acid group untouched.\n    *   Intermediate: This forms a 5-hydroxy carboxylic acid.\n    *   Cyclization: Under acidic workup (H⁺), the alcohol group attacks the carboxylic acid carbonyl, eliminating water to form the lactone.\n    *   Stereochemistry: As in the first reaction, the stereocenter is not altered during this process. The stereochemistry of the starting material dictates the stereochemistry of the product.\n    *   Conclusion: Since the product is **(R)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material **A** must be **(R)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
