    "To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, ⟨S_y⟩, for an electron in the spin state (3i, 4), we use the formula from quantum mechanics:\n\n⟨S_y⟩ = (⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩) / (⟨ψ|ψ⟩)\n\nHere, |ψ⟩ represents the spin state, ⟨ψ| is its conjugate transpose, and S_y is the spin operator for the y-direction.\n\n**1. Define the State Vector and its Conjugate Transpose:**\n\n*   The spin state is given as a vector |ψ⟩ = (3i, 4). In column vector notation, this is:\n    |ψ⟩ = [ 3i, 4 ]^T\n*   The conjugate transpose, ⟨ψ|, is found by taking the transpose of the vector and then the complex conjugate of each element:\n    ⟨ψ| = [ -3i, 4 ]\n\n**2. Calculate the Normalization Factor:**\n\n*   The normalization factor is the inner product ⟨ψ|ψ⟩:\n    ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = [-3i, 4] * [3i, 4]^T = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4) = -9i² + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25.\n\n**3. Define the Spin Operator S_y:**\n\n*   The spin operator S_y is defined in terms of the reduced Planck constant (ħ) and the Pauli Y-matrix (σ_y):\n    S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y\n*   Given the Pauli Y-matrix:\n    σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\n*   The S_y operator is:\n    S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\n\n**4. Calculate ⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩:**\n\n*   First, we apply the S_y operator to the state vector |ψ⟩:\n    S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] * [3i, 4]^T\n    S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [(0)(3i) + (-i)(4), (i)(3i) + (0)(4)]^T\n    S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [-4i, 3i²]^T\n    S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [-4i, -3]^T\n*   Next, we multiply this result by the bra vector ⟨ψ|:\n    ⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = [-3i, 4] * (ħ/2) * [-4i, -3]^T\n    ⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [(-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3)]\n    ⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [12i² - 12]\n    ⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [-12 - 12] = (ħ/2) * [-24] = -12ħ.\n\n**5. Calculate the Expectation Value ⟨S_y⟩:**\n\n*   Finally, we divide the result from step 4 by the normalization factor from step 2:\n    ⟨S_y⟩ = -12ħ / 25.\n\nThis result corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
