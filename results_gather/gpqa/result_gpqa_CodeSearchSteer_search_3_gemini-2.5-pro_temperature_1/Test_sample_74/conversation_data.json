  "question": "You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected.

    "To solve this problem, one must analyze the provided DNA sequence in the context of molecular biology principles, specifically gene expression.\n\n1.  **Analyze the start of the sequence**: The sequence begins with `ATG`. In molecular biology, ATG is the most common start codon, signaling the ribosome to begin protein synthesis with the amino acid Methionine.\n2.  **Identify the HA tag**: The scenario specifies that a single influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag was added to the N-terminus. The standard amino acid sequence for an HA tag is YPYDVPDYA. The corresponding DNA sequence is `TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC`. Looking at the provided sequence after the initial `ATG`, we find `TACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCC`, which perfectly matches the DNA sequence for the HA tag. Therefore, there is no missense mutation in the antigenic determinant's sequence, ruling out option C.\n3.  **Translate the sequence from the start**: The ribosome reads the DNA sequence in groups of three nucleotides, called codons. Let's translate the beginning of the construct:\n    *   `ATG`: Methionine (Start codon)\n    *   `TAC`: Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   `CCA`: Proline (P)\n    *   `TAC`: Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   `GAT`: Aspartic acid (D)\n    *   `GTT`: Valine (V)\n    *   `CCA`: Proline (P)\n    *   `GAT`: Aspartic acid (D)\n    *   `TAC`: Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   `GCC`: Alanine (A)\n    *   `AAA`: Lysine (K)\n    *   `TGA`: **Stop**\n\n4.  **Identify the premature stop codon**: The codon `TGA` is one of the three standard stop codons (along with TAA and TAG) that terminate translation. This stop codon appears immediately after the HA tag and a single Lysine codon, and well before the actual coding sequence for the GADD45G protein begins (`...CTCTGGAAGAAG...`).\n5.  **Conclusion**: Because of this premature stop codon, the ribosome detaches from the mRNA, and the translation process ends. This results in the production of only a very short, non-functional peptide and explains the inability to detect the full-length recombinant protein.\n\nThis directly supports option A. Option B is incorrect because a tRNA for a stop codon does not exist in any organism as a standard mechanism; instead, release factors recognize stop codons. Option D is less likely because while a lack of a linker can sometimes affect protein stability, the presence of a premature stop codon provides a definitive reason for the complete failure of translation of the full-length protein.\n\n<<<A>>>"
