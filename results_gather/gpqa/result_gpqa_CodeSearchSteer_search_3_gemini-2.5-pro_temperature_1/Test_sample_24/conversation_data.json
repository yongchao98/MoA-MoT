    "The problem asks to identify the reactants for two separate named reactions.\n\n**Reaction A: A + H2SO4 ---> 2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-one**\n\nThis reaction uses a strong acid (H2SO4) to convert reactant A into a spiroketone. This is characteristic of a Pinacol rearrangement, which involves the acid-catalyzed rearrangement of a 1,2-diol (a vicinal diol). The starting material is expected to be a diol that, upon reaction with acid, undergoes a 1,2-alkyl shift to form the ketone. The transformation of a decalin-based diol (like an octahydronaphthalene-diol) into a spiro[4.5]decanone system is a known variant of this rearrangement.\n\n*   **Proposed Reactant A = `2,7-dimethyloctahydronaphthalene-4a,8a-diol`**: This is a vicinal diol on a decalin (octahydronaphthalene) framework. This structure is a suitable precursor for a pinacol-type rearrangement to form a spirocyclic ketone. The reaction proceeds by protonation of one hydroxyl group, loss of water to form a carbocation, followed by migration of a carbon-carbon bond to form the spiro[4.5]decane skeleton and the ketone.\n*   **Proposed Reactant A = `2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-ol`**: This is the alcohol corresponding to the ketone product. Treatment with H2SO4 would primarily cause dehydration to an alkene, not oxidation to the ketone.\n\nTherefore, `2,7-dimethyloctahydronaphthalene-4a,8a-diol` is the correct reactant A.\n\n**Reaction B: B + BuLi + H+ ---> 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol**\n\nThis reaction involves a strong base (BuLi, butyllithium) and an ether to form a rearranged alcohol. This is indicative of the-Wittig rearrangement. This reaction converts an allylic ether into a homoallylic alcohol after deprotonation alpha to the ether oxygen followed by a concerted-sigmatropic shift.\n\n*   **Proposed Reactant B = `(((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene`**: This is benzyl prenyl ether. Its structure is Ph-CH2-O-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. BuLi, a strong base, deprotonates the most acidic position, which is the benzylic carbon (alpha to both the phenyl group and the ether oxygen). The resulting carbanion undergoes a-Wittig rearrangement. The mechanism leads to the formation of an alkoxide, which upon protonation (H+ workup), yields `4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol` (Ph-CH(OH)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2).\n*   **Proposed Reactant B = `4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-one`**: This is a ketone. Reaction with BuLi, a strong nucleophile, would result in the addition of a butyl group to the carbonyl carbon, forming `1-phenyl-1-butyl-4-methylpent-3-en-1-ol`, a different product than the one specified.\n\nTherefore, `(((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene` is the correct reactant B.\n\nCombining the findings for both reactions, reactant A is `2,7-dimethyloctahydronaphthalene-4a,8a-diol` and reactant B is `(((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
