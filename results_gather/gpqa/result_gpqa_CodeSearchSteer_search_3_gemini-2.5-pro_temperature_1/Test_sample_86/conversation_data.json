    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct 1H NMR data for the described compound.\n\n### 1. Determine the Molecular Structure\n\n*   **Parent Structure**: The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, which is a benzene ring with two substituents (C₆H₄). This accounts for 6 carbon atoms and 4 hydrogen atoms on the ring.\n*   **Total Carbons**: The compound has a total of 8 carbon atoms. Since the benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, the two substituents together must contain 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **Functional Groups**: The FTIR data reveals two key functional groups:\n    1.  A carbonyl group (C=O).\n    2.  An aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X, where X is a halogen like F, Cl, Br, or I).\n*   **Substituents**: Based on the functional groups, one substituent on the benzene ring is a halogen atom (-X). Halogens do not contain carbon. Therefore, the other substituent must contain both the carbonyl group and the two carbon atoms.\n*   **Carbonyl-containing Substituent**: The most common and stable substituent containing two carbons and a carbonyl group is the **acetyl group** (-COCH₃).\n*   **Final Structure**: Combining these pieces of information, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Substitution Pattern and Expected ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\nThe two substituents (-X and -COCH₃) can be arranged in ortho, meta, or para positions. The provided NMR data options will help determine the specific arrangement. Let's analyze the expected signals for a haloacetophenone (C₆H₄(X)(COCH₃)):\n\n*   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H)**: There are 4 protons on the di-substituted ring. Their chemical shift and splitting pattern will depend on the substitution pattern. They typically appear in the range of 7.0-8.0 ppm.\n*   **Methyl Protons (-CH₃)**: There are 3 protons in the acetyl group's methyl group. Since this methyl group is adjacent to a carbonyl and not to any carbon with protons, it will appear as a **singlet (s)**. Its chemical shift is typically around **2.3-2.6 ppm**.\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Given NMR Options\n\n**A) ¹H NMR: chemical shift (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n*   The peak at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde proton (-CHO)**, not a ketone. This would imply the structure is a halophenylacetaldehyde (X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO). While this structure also has 8 carbons, the multiplicity is incorrect. The -CH₂- and -CHO protons would couple, leading to a doublet and a triplet, not two singlets.\n\n**B) ¹H NMR: chemical shift (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n*   The chemical shifts around 4.6-4.8 ppm are too low for aromatic protons, which are typically found above 6.5 ppm. This option is inconsistent with an aromatic structure.\n\n**C) ¹H NMR: chemical shift (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n*   Similar to option B, the signals at 4.6-4.8 ppm are not in the aromatic region. The methyl singlet at 1.3 ppm is too shielded (upfield) for an acetyl group, which is typically found around 2.5 ppm.\n\n**D) ¹H NMR: chemical shift (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n*   **Aromatic Region**: The two doublets at 7.8 ppm (2H) and 7.6 ppm (2H) are a classic pattern for a **para (1,4)-disubstituted** benzene ring. The two pairs of chemically non-equivalent protons split each other into doublets. The chemical shifts are in the expected range for an aromatic ring with two electron-withdrawing groups.\n*   **Aliphatic Region**: The singlet at 2.3 ppm integrating to 3H perfectly matches the methyl protons of an acetyl group.\n*   **Overall Consistency**: This spectrum is fully consistent with the structure of a **para-haloacetophenone**. It accounts for the correct number of protons (4 aromatic + 3 methyl = 7 total), correct multiplicities (two doublets and a singlet), and plausible chemical shifts.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe data in option D precisely describes the ¹H NMR spectrum for a para-haloacetophenone, which fits all the criteria given in the problem statement.\n\n<<<D>>>"
