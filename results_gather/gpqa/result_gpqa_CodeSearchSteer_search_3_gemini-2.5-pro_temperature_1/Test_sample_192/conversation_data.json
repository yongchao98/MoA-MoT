    "To determine how the number of stars changes with distance, we first need to understand the relationship between parallax and distance.\n\nStellar parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`r`) to a star. This relationship is expressed as:\n\n`plx ∝ 1/r` or `r ∝ 1/plx`\n\nThe problem states that the number of stars (`N`) in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as:\n\n`N ∝ 1/plx^5`\n\nWe can substitute the relationship between parallax and distance into this equation. Since `plx ∝ 1/r`, we have:\n\n`N ∝ 1 / (1/r)^5`\n`N ∝ 1 / (1/r^5)`\n`N ∝ r^5`\n\nThis equation tells us that the *total* number of stars up to a certain distance `r` is proportional to `r^5`. However, the question asks how the number of stars changes *per unit range of distance*. This requires finding the rate of change of the number of stars with respect to distance, which is the derivative of `N` with respect to `r` (`dN/dr`).\n\nGiven `N ∝ r^5`, we can write this as `N = k * r^5`, where `k` is a constant of proportionality.\n\nNow, we differentiate `N` with respect to `r`:\n\n`dN/dr = d/dr (k * r^5)`\n`dN/dr = 5 * k * r^4`\n\nFrom this, we can see that the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to `r^4`:\n\n`dN/dr ∝ r^4`\n\nTherefore, the number of stars in that region of the sky changes with distance with a proportionality of `r^4`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
