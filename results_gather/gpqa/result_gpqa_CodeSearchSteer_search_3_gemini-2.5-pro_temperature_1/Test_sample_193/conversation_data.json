    "To find the partition function Z for the system of three spins S1, S2, and S3, we must sum the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE), over all possible states of the system. The energy E is given by the expression E = -J[S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3], and each spin can take a value of +1 or -1.\n\nFirst, we identify all possible configurations of the three spins and calculate the energy for each state. There are 2^3 = 8 possible states:\n\n1.  **All spins up:** (S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1)\n    E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\n2.  **Two spins up, one spin down:** There are three such states.\n    *   (S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1): E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = J\n    *   (S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1): E = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = J\n    *   (S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1): E = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = J\n\n3.  **One spin up, two spins down:** There are three such states.\n    *   (S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1): E = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = J\n    *   (S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1): E = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = J\n    *   (S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1): E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = J\n\n4.  **All spins down:** (S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1)\n    E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\nNext, we group the states by their energy levels to find the degeneracy of each level:\n\n*   **Energy Level E = -3J:** There are two states with this energy (all spins up and all spins down). The degeneracy is 2.\n*   **Energy Level E = J:** There are six states with this energy (the \"two spins up, one down\" and \"one spin up, two down\" configurations). The degeneracy is 6.\n\nThe partition function Z is the sum over all states, which can be written as a sum over the energy levels multiplied by their degeneracies:\n\nZ = Σ_i g_i * e^(-βE_i)\n\nSubstituting the energy levels and their degeneracies we found:\n\nZ = (2 * e^(-β * -3J)) + (6 * e^(-β * J))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
