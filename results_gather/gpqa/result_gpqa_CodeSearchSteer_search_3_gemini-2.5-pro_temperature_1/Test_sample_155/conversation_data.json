    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reactions and the resulting chromatograms.\n\n### Reaction Analysis\n\n*   **Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**\n    1.  **Epoxidation:** (E)-oct-4-ene (a trans-alkene) is treated with mCPBA. This is a syn-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond. This reaction is stereospecific, and the trans configuration of the starting material is maintained in the product. This results in the formation of a trans-epoxide. Since the starting alkene is achiral, the product is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening:** The epoxide ring is then opened by an aqueous acid. This is an anti-addition, where the water molecule attacks from the opposite side of the epoxide oxygen. The attack on either the (4R,5R) or (4S,5S) enantiomer results in the formation of the same single, achiral meso compound: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. This compound has two stereocenters but is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n    1.  **Epoxidation:** (Z)-oct-4-ene (a cis-alkene) reacts with mCPBA. The syn-addition of oxygen results in a cis-epoxide. Because the starting alkene is symmetrical, this cis-epoxide is a meso compound (meso-4,5-epoxyoctane).\n    2.  **Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening:** The subsequent anti-addition of water opens the meso-epoxide. This process leads to the formation of a racemic mixture of two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### Product Mixture\nThe final mixture that is analyzed contains the products from both reactions:\n1.  **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (a meso compound from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (an enantiomer from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (an enantiomer from Reaction 2)\n\nThese three molecules are stereoisomers. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are enantiomers of each other. The meso diol is a diastereomer of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols.\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis\n\n*   **Standard (Achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated. The meso diol will have a different retention time than the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   Therefore, the standard HPLC will show **two peaks**.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This method uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The chiral column will be able to resolve the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers into two separate peaks.\n    *   The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the enantiomers, will also be separated and will appear as a distinct peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chiral HPLC will show **three peaks**.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<B>>>"
