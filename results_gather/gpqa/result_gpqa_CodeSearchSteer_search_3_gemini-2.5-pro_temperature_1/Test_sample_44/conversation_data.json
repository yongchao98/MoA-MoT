    "The problem asks for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n### Key Principles\n\n1.  **Energy Levels in an Infinite Well:** For a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L, the allowed energy levels are given by `En = n^2 * (π^2 * ħ^2) / (2mL^2)`. The problem defines the energy unit `E = (π^2 * ħ^2) / (2mL^2)`, so the single-particle energy levels are `En = n^2 * E`, where `n = 1, 2, 3, ...`.\n2.  **Identical Spin-1/2 Particles:** These particles are fermions.\n3.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** No two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. For a particle in this potential well, a quantum state is defined by its energy quantum number `n` and its spin projection (`ms = +1/2` for spin up or `ms = -1/2` for spin down). This means each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles, one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n### Calculation of System Energies\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the four individual particles. To find the energies of the different states, we must fill the single-particle energy levels according to the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   **Single-particle energy levels:**\n    *   `E1 = 1^2 * E = 1E`\n    *   `E2 = 2^2 * E = 4E`\n    *   `E3 = 3^2 * E = 9E`\n    *   `E4 = 4^2 * E = 16E`\n    *   and so on...\n\n#### Ground State Energy\n\nTo achieve the ground state (the lowest possible total energy), we fill the lowest available energy levels first.\n\n*   Two particles go into the `n=1` level (one spin up, one spin down).\n*   The remaining two particles go into the `n=2` level (one spin up, one spin down).\n\nThe total ground state energy is:\n`E_ground = (2 * E1) + (2 * E2) = (2 * 1E) + (2 * 4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E`\n\n#### First Excited State Energy\n\nTo get the first excited state, we need to make the smallest possible energy jump from the ground state configuration. This is achieved by moving one particle from the highest occupied energy level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (`n=3`).\n\n*   The new configuration is: two particles in `n=1`, one particle in `n=2`, and one particle in `n=3`.\n\nThe total first excited state energy is:\n`E_first_excited = (2 * E1) + (1 * E2) + (1 * E3) = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`\n\n#### Second Excited State Energy\n\nTo find the second excited state, we consider the next possible low-energy excitations from the ground state. There are two primary possibilities to create a state with energy higher than the first excited state:\n\n1.  **Promote a particle from `n=2` to `n=4`**:\n    *   Configuration: Two particles in `n=1`, one in `n=2`, one in `n=4`.\n    *   Energy = `(2 * E1) + (1 * E2) + (1 * E4) = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E`.\n\n2.  **Promote a particle from `n=1` to `n=3`**:\n    *   Configuration: One particle in `n=1`, two in `n=2`, one in `n=3`.\n    *   Energy = `(1 * E1) + (2 * E2) + (1 * E3) = (1 * 1E) + (2 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E`.\n\nComparing the possible energies, the lower value is 18E. Thus, this is the energy of the second excited state.\n\n### Summary of Energies:\n\n*   **Ground State:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State:** 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
