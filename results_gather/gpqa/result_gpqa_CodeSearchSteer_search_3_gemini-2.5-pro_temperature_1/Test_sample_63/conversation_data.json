    "The detailed chemical analysis provided in the prompt allows for a step-by-step deduction of the identities of salts A and B.\n\n### Analysis of Gaseous Products\n\n1.  **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent used to absorb water. The mass increase of 3.60 g is due to the absorption of water (H₂O).\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol\n\n2.  **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases, most notably carbon dioxide (CO₂). The fact that the weight of the tube did not change indicates that no acidic gases were present in the mixture produced by the decomposition.\n\n3.  **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂). The mass increase of the tube (0.80 g) corresponds to the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted to form copper oxide (CuO).\n    *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 0.80 g\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol\n    *   Since the gas is O₂, moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol\n\n4.  **Gas C (Remaining gas):** The remaining gas C has a volume of 2.24 liters at standard temperature and pressure (STP), which corresponds to:\n    *   Moles of C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, the total mass of the products equals the initial mass of the reactants (7.20 g). We can find the mass of gas C:\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.025 mol * 32.0 g/mol = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of C = Total Mass - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(O₂) = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g\n\nNow, we can determine the molar mass of gas C:\n*   Molar Mass of C = Mass of C / Moles of C = 2.80 g / 0.1 mol = 28.0 g/mol\n\nA gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol that is inert to the reagents used is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n### Identification of Salts A and B\n\nThe decomposition of the salt mixture produced H₂O, O₂, and N₂. This indicates the original salts were composed of nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen. As no solid residue was left, this points towards ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing oxoacids. The most common candidates are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nLet's examine their decomposition reactions:\n*   **Ammonium Nitrite:** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g).\n*   **Ammonium Nitrate:** At temperatures around 200-250°C, the decomposition is 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g). At lower temperatures, it primarily produces N₂O and H₂O. Given the products, the higher temperature decomposition is the relevant reaction.\n\nThe problem states the initial mixture was equimolar. Let's assume the mixture consists of `x` moles of salt A (NH₄NO₂) and `x` moles of salt B (NH₄NO₃).\n\nThe total moles of products would be:\n*   **From `x` mol of NH₄NO₂:** `x` mol N₂ + `2x` mol H₂O\n*   **From `x` mol of NH₄NO₃:** `x` mol N₂ + `0.5x` mol O₂ + `2x` mol H₂O\n\nThe total moles of each product from the mixture are:\n*   **Total N₂:** `x` + `x` = `2x`\n*   **Total H₂O:** `2x` + `2x` = `4x`\n*   **Total O₂:** `0.5x`\n\nThe ratio of the product moles is H₂O : N₂ : O₂ = `4x` : `2x` : `0.5x`, which simplifies to 8 : 4 : 1.\n\nLet's compare this to the experimental moles we calculated:\n*   n(H₂O) = 0.2 mol\n*   n(N₂) = 0.1 mol\n*   n(O₂) = 0.025 mol\n\nThe experimental ratio is 0.2 : 0.1 : 0.025, which also simplifies to 8 : 4 : 1. The perfect match confirms our hypothesis.\n\nNow, we can find the value of `x`:\n*   Using O₂: `0.5x` = 0.025 mol  => `x` = 0.05 mol\n*   Using N₂: `2x` = 0.1 mol => `x` = 0.05 mol\n*   Using H₂O: `4x` = 0.2 mol => `x` = 0.05 mol\n\nAll calculations consistently show that the mixture contained 0.05 moles of each salt.\n\nAs a final check, let's calculate the initial mass:\n*   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.04 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.04 g/mol.\n*   Total Mass = (0.05 mol * 64.04 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 80.04 g/mol) = 3.202 g + 4.002 g = 7.204 g. This matches the given initial mass of 7.20 g.\n\n### Calculation of Total Atoms\n\nThe final step is to find the total number of atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one of salt B.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite - NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 2 O = 8 atoms\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate - NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 3 O = 9 atoms\n\nTotal number of atoms = 8 (from A) + 9 (from B) = 17 atoms.\n\n<<<A>>>"
