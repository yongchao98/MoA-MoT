    "To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs, we must check two conditions for each star:\n1.  **Visibility:** The star must be observable from both the Paranal Observatory in Chile (Southern Hemisphere) and the Keck Observatory in Hawaii, USA (Northern Hemisphere).\n2.  **Brightness:** The star's apparent V magnitude must be brighter than the limits of *both* instruments. Since ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag and HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag, the combined requirement is an **apparent V magnitude < 16.0**.\n\n### **1. Observatory Visibility**\n*   The Paranal Observatory is located at a latitude of about -24.6 degrees.\n*   The W. M. Keck Observatory is located at a latitude of approximately +19.8 degrees.\n\nDisregarding pointing limits as requested, a simplified visibility range can be estimated. A star is generally visible if its declination (DEC) is between the observatory's latitude - 90° and its latitude + 90°.\n*   **Paranal (Southern Hemisphere):** The theoretical northern limit is approximately DEC < -24.6° + 90° = +65.4°.\n*   **Keck (Northern Hemisphere):** The theoretical southern limit is approximately DEC > +19.8° - 90° = -70.2°.\n\nTherefore, for a star to be visible from both locations, its declination must be within the approximate range of **-70.2° < DEC < +65.4°**.\n\n### **2. Star Analysis**\n\nThe apparent magnitude (m) is calculated from the absolute magnitude (M) and distance (d) in parsecs using the distance modulus formula: **m = M + 5log₁₀(d) - 5**. If there is interstellar dust, the magnitude is further dimmed by an extinction value (Aᵥ), making the observed magnitude **m_obs = m + Aᵥ**.\n\nHere is the analysis for each star:\n\n*   **Star1:**\n    *   **Visibility:** Its declination is -75°, which is south of the visibility limit for the Keck Observatory (~ -70.2°).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not observable by both.\n\n*   **Star2:**\n    *   **Visibility:** Its declination is +55°, which is within the observable range for both observatories.\n    *   **Brightness:** Its apparent V magnitude is given as 16.5 mag. This is fainter than the required < 16.0 mag limit for HIRES.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not observable by both.\n\n*   **Star3:**\n    *   **Visibility:** Its declination is +48°, which is within the observable range for both observatories.\n    *   **Brightness:** Its apparent V magnitude is given as 15.5 mag. This is brighter than the 16.0 mag limit. The additional information about color excess E(B-V) does not alter the already provided apparent magnitude.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Observable by both.**\n\n*   **Star4:**\n    *   **Visibility:** Its declination is -48°, which is within the observable range for both observatories.\n    *   **Brightness:** To find the apparent magnitude, we must first calculate it from its absolute magnitude and distance, and then add the extinction.\n        *   Apparent magnitude without extinction: m = 15.5 + 5log₁₀(10) - 5 = 15.5 mag.\n        *   Extinction (Aᵥ) = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag.\n        *   Observed Apparent V magnitude = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74 mag. This is fainter than the 16.0 mag limit.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not observable by both.\n\n*   **Star5:**\n    *   **Visibility:** Its declination is +60°, which is within the observable range for both observatories.\n    *   **Brightness:** We calculate the apparent magnitude from its absolute magnitude (16.5) and distance (5 pc).\n        *   Apparent V magnitude = 16.5 + 5log₁₀(5) - 5 ≈ 16.5 + 5(0.699) - 5 ≈ 14.995 mag.\n        *   This is brighter than the 16.0 mag limit.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Observable by both.**\n\nBased on the analysis, only Star3 and Star5 meet both the visibility and brightness criteria for both observatories.\n\n<<<B>>>"
