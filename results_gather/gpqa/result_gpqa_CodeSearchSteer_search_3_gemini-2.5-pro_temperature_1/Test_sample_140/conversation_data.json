    "The reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in condensed ammonia is a classic example of an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate. Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of possible organic products.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates\n\nThe strong base, the amide anion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton from a position ortho (adjacent) to the bromine atom. In 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene, there are two such positions:\n*   **C6:** This carbon has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **C2:** This carbon has a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThe amide ion can abstract either the proton from C6 or the deuteron from C2, leading to two different pathways and two different benzyne intermediates:\n\n1.  **Path A: Abstraction of H from C6:** The removal of H⁺ from C6 and the subsequent elimination of the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1 results in a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains in the molecule. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n2.  **Path B: Abstraction of D from C2:** The removal of D⁺ from C2 and the elimination of Br⁻ from C1 forms a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C2. In this case, the deuterium is removed from the ring. This intermediate is **benzyne** (with no deuterium).\n\nDue to the kinetic isotope effect, breaking a C-H bond is faster than breaking a C-D bond, so Path A is favored. However, both reactions occur, leading to the formation of both benzyne intermediates.\n\n### Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to Benzyne Intermediates\n\nThe amide anion (NH₂⁻) then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the benzyne intermediates.\n\n1.  **Addition to Benzyne (from Path B):**\n    *   The benzyne formed has a triple bond between C1 and C2 and is symmetrical with respect to the incoming nucleophile.\n    *   Attack of NH₂⁻ at either C1 or C2, followed by protonation from the ammonia solvent, leads to the same product: **Aniline**.\n\n2.  **Addition to 3-deuterobenzyne (from Path A):**\n    *   This intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C6, and a deuterium atom at C2. It is not symmetrical.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** If the NH₂⁻ group attacks C1, a carbanion forms at C6. Protonation at C6 yields **2-deuterioaniline** (the amino group and the deuterium are ortho to each other).\n    *   **Attack at C6:** If the NH₂⁻ group attacks C6, a carbanion forms at C1. Protonation at C1 yields **3-deuterioaniline** (the amino group and the deuterium are meta to each other).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining the products from both pathways, we get a total of three possible organic products:\n1.  Aniline\n2.  2-deuterioaniline\n3.  3-deuterioaniline\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>"
