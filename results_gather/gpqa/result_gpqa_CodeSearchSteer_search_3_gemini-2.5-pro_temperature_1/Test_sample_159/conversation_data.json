    "An N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a' approaches the shape of a circle as N becomes infinitely large. The apothem of the polygon becomes the radius of the circle. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\nThe diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture is known as the Airy pattern. This pattern consists of a central bright disk, called the Airy disk, surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings. The angular positions of the dark rings (minima) are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function.\n\nFor a circular aperture of diameter D, the angular positions of the minima are given by the formula:\nsin(θ) ≈ θ = m * λ / D\nwhere:\n*   θ is the angular position of the minimum.\n*   λ is the wavelength of the light.\n*   D is the diameter of the aperture.\n*   m is a coefficient corresponding to the order of the minimum.\n\nIn this problem, the radius of the aperture is 'a', so its diameter D = 2a. The positions of the first two minima are given by specific values for 'm'.\n\n*   **First Minimum:** This occurs at the edge of the central Airy disk. The accepted value for m₁ is approximately 1.220.\n    The angular position of the first minimum (θ₁) is:\n    θ₁ = 1.220 * λ / (2a) = 0.610 * λ / a\n\n*   **Second Minimum:** This is the next dark ring in the pattern. The value for m₂ is approximately 2.233.\n    The angular position of the second minimum (θ₂) is:\n    θ₂ = 2.233 * λ / (2a) ≈ 1.1165 * λ / a\n\nThe angular distance between these first two minima is the difference between their angular positions:\nΔθ = θ₂ - θ₁\nΔθ = (1.1165 * λ / a) - (0.610 * λ / a)\nΔθ = (1.1165 - 0.610) * λ / a\nΔθ = 0.5065 * λ / a\n\nThis value is approximately 0.506 λ / a.\n\n<<<A>>>"
