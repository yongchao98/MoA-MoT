    "This riddle describes the initial steps of the protein secretory pathway.\n\n*   **\"Oh, I know you,\" the ribonucleoprotein particle says to the nascent chain as they meet.**\n    The \"ribonucleoprotein particle\" is the Signal Recognition Particle (SRP), which is composed of both RNA and protein. The \"nascent chain\" is a newly forming protein emerging from a ribosome. The SRP recognizes a specific signal sequence on the chain. This meeting occurs in the cell's cytosol.\n\n*   **\"Pause there for a minute. Let me show you in; you really need some sugar.\"**\n    When the SRP binds to the nascent chain and ribosome, it temporarily pauses protein synthesis. The SRP then guides this entire complex to the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The phrase \"you really need some sugar\" alludes to N-linked glycosylation, a process where sugar molecules are attached to the protein, which begins inside the ER.\n\n*   **\"It seems somewhat rough. I guess this is goodbye; I need to be on my way\", the chain replies.**\n    The destination the SRP leads the chain to is the **Rough** Endoplasmic Reticulum (RER), so named because its surface is studded with ribosomes. Once the protein is delivered to the RER, the SRP's job is done. The protein is then fed into the RER, where it will be folded and modified. From the RER, proteins in the secretory pathway are transported to the Golgi apparatus and then onward to their final destinations, which often include being secreted from the cell into the extracellular space.\n\nTherefore, they met in the **cytosol**, and the chain is ultimately heading to the **extracellular space**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
