    "Spontaneously broken symmetries are a fundamental concept in physics, where the underlying laws of a system possess a symmetry that the ground state (the state of lowest energy) does not. According to Goldstone's theorem, for every continuous symmetry that is spontaneously broken, a new massless particle (or quasiparticle) must appear, known as a Goldstone boson. In some cases, if the symmetry is also slightly broken by another effect (explicitly broken), this particle acquires a small mass and is called a pseudo-Goldstone boson.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the particles listed:\n\n*   **A) Pion:** In the theory of the strong nuclear force (Quantum Chromodynamics), there is an approximate symmetry called chiral symmetry. This symmetry is spontaneously broken, and the resulting pseudo-Goldstone bosons are the pions. Their relatively small mass compared to other hadrons is a consequence of this mechanism.\n\n*   **B) Phonon:** In a crystalline solid, the atoms are arranged in a regular lattice. This arrangement breaks the continuous translational symmetry of empty spaceâ€”the laws of physics don't change if you shift everything, but the crystal itself is not unchanged by an arbitrary shift. The collective, quantized vibrations of this lattice are known as phonons. Phonons are the Goldstone bosons associated with this spontaneously broken translational symmetry.\n\n*   **D) Magnon:** In a ferromagnet below its Curie temperature, all the magnetic moments (spins) of the atoms spontaneously align in a single direction. This breaks the rotational symmetry of the underlying physical laws, as a preferred direction has been chosen. The Goldstone bosons corresponding to this broken rotational symmetry are magnons, which are quantized spin waves.\n\n*   **C) Skyrmion:** A skyrmion is not a Goldstone boson. It is a topologically stable, particle-like solution (a topological soliton) in a nonlinear field theory. While skyrmions can arise in theories that also exhibit spontaneous symmetry breaking (for instance, the original Skyrme model described baryons as solitons of the pion field, where the pions themselves are Goldstone bosons), the skyrmion itself is not the Goldstone boson. Its stability comes from its topological character (a \"knot\" in the field), not from being the massless excitation of a broken symmetry.\n\nTherefore, the pion, phonon, and magnon are all associated with spontaneously-broken symmetries as Goldstone bosons, while the skyrmion is not.\n\n<<<C>>>"
