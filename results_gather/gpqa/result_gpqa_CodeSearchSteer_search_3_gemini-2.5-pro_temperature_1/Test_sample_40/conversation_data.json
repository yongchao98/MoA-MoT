    "This problem requires the application of the relativistic velocity addition formula, a key concept in Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity. This scenario is a classic example, famously demonstrated by the Fizeau experiment, which measured the speed of light in moving water and was a crucial piece of evidence supporting special relativity.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Define the reference frames:**\n    *   **Laboratory Frame (S):** This is the observer's stationary frame of reference.\n    *   **Glass's Frame (S'):** This is the moving frame of reference, which is the glass itself.\n\n2.  **Define the velocities:**\n    *   **v:** The velocity of the glass (frame S') relative to the laboratory (frame S).\n    *   **u':** The velocity of the light beam relative to the glass (frame S').\n    *   **u:** The velocity of the light beam relative to the laboratory (frame S). This is the value we need to find.\n\n3.  **Determine the speed of light in the glass's rest frame (u'):**\n    The speed of light in a medium with a refractive index *n* is given by `c/n`. Since the problem states the speed of light in a vacuum `c=1`, the speed of light within the glass, as measured in the glass's own rest frame, is:\n    `u' = 1/n`\n\n4.  **Apply the relativistic velocity addition formula:**\n    The formula for adding velocities in the same direction in special relativity is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\n5.  **Substitute the known values into the formula:**\n    We substitute `u' = 1/n` and `c = 1` into the equation:\n    `u = ((1/n) + v) / (1 + ((1/n) * v) / 1^2)`\n\n6.  **Simplify the expression:**\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n    To eliminate the fractions in the numerator and denominator, multiply both by *n*:\n    `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\nThis result matches option B. This formula was confirmed by Max von Laue in 1907, who showed that the results of the Fizeau experiment were a natural consequence of Einstein's velocity addition law.\n\n<<<B>>>"
