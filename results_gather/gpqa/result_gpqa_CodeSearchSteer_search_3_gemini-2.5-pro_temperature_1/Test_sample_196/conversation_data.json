    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product:\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of Compound X from Spectroscopic Data**\n\nFirst, we will deduce the structure of the starting material, Compound X, using the provided Infrared (IR) and Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) data.\n\n**Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n*   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This very broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is undergoing hydrogen bonding.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong, sharp peak falls in the region for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, specifically indicating a carboxylic acid.\n*   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These absorptions are typical for carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretching within an aromatic ring.\n\nFrom the IR data, we can confidently conclude that Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n**¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n*   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet appearing far downfield is a classic signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n*   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is indicative of a *para*-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The doublet at 8.0 ppm is downfield because it is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group. The doublet at 7.2 ppm is further upfield, suggesting it is adjacent to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n*   **Alkyl Group Signals:**\n    *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for one proton, likely a CH group attached to multiple other carbons.\n    *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for two protons, suggesting a CH₂ group.\n    *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for three protons, which is a CH₃ group adjacent to a CH group.\n    *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for three protons, indicating a CH₃ group adjacent to a CH₂ group.\n\n**Assembling the Alkyl Group:**\nLet's piece together the alkyl substituent from its NMR signals. We have a -CH(CH₃)- fragment (from the 2.9 ppm and 1.4 ppm signals) and a -CH₂CH₃ fragment (from the 1.7 ppm and 0.9 ppm signals). Combining these, the most logical structure for the alkyl chain is a *sec*-butyl group: -CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃. The CH at 2.9 ppm is the proton attached directly to the aromatic ring.\n\n**Structure of Compound X:**\nCombining all the information, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option (D).\n\n### **Step 2: Identify the Product of the Reaction**\n\nThe problem states that Compound X, which we've identified as 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, reacts with red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n\n*   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus and HI are a powerful reducing agent system.\n*   **Reaction:** This combination is known to completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). The general reaction is R-COOH → R-CH₃. It is a strong reduction that will not stop at the alcohol stage. The aromatic ring and the existing alkyl group will remain unaffected by these conditions.\n\n**Applying the Reaction to Compound X:**\n*   **Starting Material:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n*   **Transformation:** The -COOH group at position 1 of the benzene ring is reduced to a -CH₃ group.\n*   **Final Product:** The *sec*-butyl group at position 4 remains unchanged. The resulting molecule is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n### **Step 3: Match the Product to the Given Options**\n\nLet's compare our predicted product with the choices:\n*   A) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: Incorrect. The alkyl group is *sec*-butyl, not isobutyl.\n*   B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: Incorrect. The carboxylic acid is reduced, not retained.\n*   C) **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene:** Correct. This matches our predicted product.\n*   D) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: Incorrect. This is the starting material.\n\nThe final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>"
