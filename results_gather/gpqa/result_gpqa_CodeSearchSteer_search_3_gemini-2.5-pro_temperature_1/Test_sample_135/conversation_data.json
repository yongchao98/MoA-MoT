    "This problem requires evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a radially dependent vector field, `f(r)`. The magnitude of the field is given as `f(r) = 1/r^2`, and it points exclusively in the radial direction. In spherical coordinates, this vector field `f` can be expressed as `f = (1/r^2) * r_hat`, where `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\nThe task is to calculate `∫∇⋅f dV` over the volume of a sphere of radius R centered at the origin.\n\nA direct calculation of the divergence of `f` in spherical coordinates yields:\n`∇⋅f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * f_r)/∂r`\nSince `f_r = 1/r^2`, this becomes:\n`∇⋅f = (1/r^2) * ∂(r^2 * (1/r^2))/∂r = (1/r^2) * ∂(1)/∂r = 0`.\n\nThis result, however, is only valid for `r ≠ 0`. At the origin (r=0), the field `f` is singular (undefined), which means its divergence is also not defined in the traditional sense. The origin acts as a \"source of divergence\". This situation is analogous to the electric field of a point charge, where the divergence is zero everywhere except at the location of the charge.\n\nTo correctly evaluate the integral over a volume that includes this singularity, we can use the Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem). The theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the flux of that field through the closed surface enclosing the volume:\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S f ⋅ dS`\n\nHere, `V` is the sphere of radius R, and `S` is its surface. The differential surface element `dS` for a sphere of radius R is `dS = R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ * r_hat`.\n\nThe surface integral (or flux) is calculated as follows:\n`∮_S f ⋅ dS = ∫∫_S (1/R^2 * r_hat) ⋅ (R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ * r_hat)`\nThe `R^2` terms cancel out, and the dot product `r_hat ⋅ r_hat` is 1. The integral becomes:\n`∫_0^(2π) dφ ∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ`\nEvaluating this integral gives:\n`[φ]_0^(2π) * [-cos(θ)]_0^π = (2π) * (-cos(π) - (-cos(0))) = (2π) * (-(-1) - (-1)) = 2π * (1 + 1) = 4π`.\n\nThis result of `4π` is independent of the radius R of the sphere (as long as R > 0). The calculation shows that even though the divergence is zero almost everywhere, the singularity at the origin creates a finite, non-zero value for the integral over any volume containing it. The divergence at the origin can be described by the Dirac delta function, such that `∇ ⋅ (r_hat/r^2) = 4πδ(r)`.\n\nTherefore, the volume integral of the divergence of the field within the sphere is `4π`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
