    "Thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts **slower** in acidic solutions.\n\nHere is the reasoning behind this conclusion:\n\n*   **Thermodynamics: Weaker in Basic Solutions**\n    The strength of an oxidizing agent is determined by its standard reduction potential (E°). A more positive E° value indicates a stronger oxidant.\n    *   In an acidic solution (pH 0), the reduction of oxygen is represented as: O₂ + 4H⁺ + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O, with a standard potential of **+1.23 V**.\n    *   In a basic solution (pH 14), the reaction is: O₂ + 2H₂O + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻, with a standard potential of **+0.40 V**.\n    Since the reduction potential is significantly lower (less positive) in basic solution compared to acidic solution, oxygen is thermodynamically a weaker oxidizing agent in basic conditions.\n\n*   **Kinetics: Slower in Acidic Solutions**\n    Kinetics deals with the rate of a reaction. Despite being a stronger oxidant thermodynamically, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is kinetically sluggish. Several studies show that the reaction is generally slower in acidic media compared to alkaline (basic) media. For instance, the rate of oxidation of some substances by oxygen is inversely proportional to the H⁺ concentration, meaning the reaction slows down as acidity increases. Studies on various electrode materials have confirmed that the ORR activity is often lower in acidic solutions than in alkaline ones.\n\nTherefore, the correct words to complete the statement are \"weaker\" and \"slower\".\n\n<<<B>>>"
