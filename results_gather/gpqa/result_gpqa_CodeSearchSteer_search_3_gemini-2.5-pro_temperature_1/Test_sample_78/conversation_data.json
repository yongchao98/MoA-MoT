    "The problem asks to identify Compound X (C11H12O) which, upon reaction with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K, yields a product with specific ¹H and ¹³C NMR spectra. This reaction is a base-catalyzed isomerization, as the molecular formula of the product remains C11H12O.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Structure of the Product from NMR Data\n\nFirst, we analyze the provided NMR spectra to determine the structure of the reaction product.\n\n**¹³C NMR Analysis:**\n*   **δ 197.7 (1C, s):** This chemical shift is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon, specifically a ketone.\n*   **δ 144.1, 141.5, 130.3, 129.1 (2C), 127.1, 126.9 (2C):** These signals are in the alkene/aromatic region (100-150 ppm). The presence of two signals with an integration of 2C each (129.1 and 126.9 ppm) suggests a symmetrically substituted aromatic ring, likely a para-substituted benzene ring.\n*   **δ 28.4 (1C, s) and 21.3 (1C, s):** These are aliphatic carbon signals, corresponding to two different methyl groups.\n\n**¹H NMR Analysis:**\n*   **δ 2.28 (3H, s) and 2.31 (3H, s):** These are two singlets, each integrating to 3 protons, confirming the presence of two methyl groups that are not coupled to any adjacent protons.\n*   **δ 7.71 (2H, d) and 7.08 (2H, d):** These two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, are characteristic of a para-substituted benzene ring.\n*   **δ 7.68 (1H, d) and 6.75 (1H, d):** These two doublets, each integrating to 1 proton, indicate two vinyl protons that are coupled to each other, forming a `-CH=CH-` group.\n\n**Assembling the Product Structure:**\nBased on the NMR data, the product contains:\n1.  A ketone group (`C=O`).\n2.  A para-substituted benzene ring.\n3.  Two methyl groups (`-CH₃`).\n4.  A disubstituted vinyl group (`-CH=CH-`).\n\nOne methyl group (e.g., at δ 2.31) is attached to the benzene ring, forming a p-tolyl group. The other methyl group (δ 2.28) is part of an acetyl group (`-C(=O)CH₃`), consistent with the ketone signal. The p-tolyl group and the acetyl group are connected by the vinyl bridge. This leads to the structure of **(E)-4-(4-methylphenyl)-3-buten-2-one**.\n\n*   **Structure:** `p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)CH₃`\n*   **Formula:** C₁₁H₁₂O, which matches the starting material.\n*   **NMR Assignment:**\n    *   ¹H NMR: `Ar-CH₃` (δ 2.31), `-C(=O)CH₃` (δ 2.28), `Ar-H` (δ 7.08 and 7.71, though the shifts are somewhat unusual, the pattern is correct), `=CH-CO` (δ 6.75), `Ar-CH=` (δ 7.68).\n    *   ¹³C NMR: `C=O` (δ 197.7), aromatic & vinyl carbons (δ 126.9-144.1), `Ar-CH₃` (δ 21.3), `CO-CH₃` (δ 28.4).\n\n### Step 2: Identify Compound X by Proposing a Reaction Mechanism\n\nThe reaction is a rearrangement of Compound X to (E)-4-(4-methylphenyl)-3-buten-2-one, catalyzed by the non-nucleophilic base DABCO at high temperature. This suggests an isomerization of an epoxide. Specifically, the DABCO-catalyzed rearrangement of vinyl epoxides to α,β-unsaturated ketones is a known reaction, often referred to as a Meinwald-type rearrangement.\n\nLet's examine the given options for Compound X:\n\n*   **A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:**\n    *   The \"4-methylstyryl\" group is `p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-`.\n    *   The structure is `p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂` (a terminal vinyl epoxide).\n    *   The molecular formula is C₁₁H₁₂O.\n    *   This compound is a vinyl epoxide which can rearrange to the identified product, (E)-4-(4-methylphenyl)-3-buten-2-one. This is a plausible starting material.\n\n*   **B) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:**\n    *   The \"styryl\" group is `C₆H₅-CH=CH-`.\n    *   The structure contains a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group. Rearrangement would not yield a product with a p-tolyl group.\n\n*   **C) 2-styrylepoxide:**\n    *   Also known as 2-styryloxirane.\n    *   The molecular formula is C₁₀H₁₀O, which is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:**\n    *   The structure is `C₆H₅-CH=C(CH₃)-CH(O)CH₂`.\n    *   Rearrangement of this epoxide would lead to `3-methyl-4-phenyl-3-buten-2-one`. The ¹H NMR spectrum of this product would show a vinyl singlet and a 5H multiplet for the phenyl group, which does not match the experimental data.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe product of the reaction is (E)-4-(4-methylphenyl)-3-buten-2-one. The only starting material that has the correct molecular formula (C₁₁H₁₂O) and could plausibly rearrange to this product under the given conditions is 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. The reaction is a base-catalyzed Meinwald rearrangement of a vinyl epoxide to an α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n\n<<<A>>>"
