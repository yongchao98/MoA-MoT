    "The final answer is $\\boxed{A}$.\n### Step-by-step Deriviation:\nThe problem asks for the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product formed when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus (Red P) and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI).\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material:**\n\nFirst, let's determine the structure and molecular formula of the starting material: **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**.\n\n*   **Parent Structure:** `cyclohex-3-ene` is a six-membered ring with one double bond.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   A `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) at position 1.\n    *   A `formyl` (aldehyde) group (-CHO) at position 2.\n    *   A `vinyl` group (-CH=CH₂) at position 5.\n\nLet's calculate the initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) from the structure. The IHD is the sum of rings and π-bonds in a molecule.\n\n*   One ring: IHD = 1\n*   One C=C double bond in the cyclohexene ring: IHD = 1\n*   One C=C double bond in the vinyl group: IHD = 1\n*   One C=O double bond in the formyl group: IHD = 1\n*   One C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group: IHD = 1\n\n**Total IHD of starting material = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.**\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction:**\n\nThe reagent is **Red Phosphorus (P) and excess Hydroiodic Acid (HI)**. This combination is a very powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. It is known to reduce many functional groups completely to their corresponding alkanes.\n\n*   **Aldehydes (-CHO)** are reduced to alkanes (-CH₃).\n*   **Carboxylic acids (-COOH)** are reduced to alkanes (-CH₃).\n*   **Alkenes (C=C)** are reduced to alkanes (C-C).\n*   It also reduces alcohols and ketones to alkanes.\n\nThe reaction will cause the following transformations:\n*   The **formyl group** (-CHO) will be reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n*   The **carboxylic acid group** (-COOH) will be reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n*   The **vinyl group's double bond** (-CH=CH₂) will be reduced to an **ethyl group** (-CH₂CH₃).\n*   The **double bond in the cyclohexene ring** will be reduced, making it a **cyclohexane ring**.\n\n**3. Determine the Product:**\n\nThe reaction reduces all π-bonds (C=C and C=O) and removes all oxygen atoms, but it does not open the ring.\nThe carbon skeleton of the starting material consists of a 6-carbon ring, a 1-carbon formyl group, a 1-carbon carboxylic acid group, and a 2-carbon vinyl group, totaling 10 carbon atoms. The product will be a fully saturated hydrocarbon (a substituted cycloalkane) with the same 10-carbon skeleton.\n\nThe product is a **disubstituted ethyl- and dimethyl-cyclohexane**. Since it is a substituted cycloalkane, it contains no double bonds.\n\n**4. Calculate the IHD of the Product:**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) is a count of the rings and/or π-bonds in a molecule.\n*   **Rings:** The product still has the cyclohexane ring. This contributes **1** to the IHD.\n*   **π-bonds:** All double bonds from the original molecule have been reduced. The product has **0** π-bonds.\n\n**Total IHD of the product = 1 (for the ring) + 0 (for π-bonds) = 1.**\n\nAlternatively, we can determine the molecular formula. A saturated monocyclic alkane follows the general formula CₙH₂ₙ. Since the product has 10 carbon atoms, its formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n\nUsing the IHD formula: IHD = C - (H/2) + 1 (for molecules with C and H only).\nIHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1\nIHD = 10 - 10 + 1\nIHD = 1\n\nTherefore, the index of hydrogen deficiency of the final product is 1.\n\n"
