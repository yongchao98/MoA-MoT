    "The problem asks for the minimum energy of a system of 13 identical particles. One particle is fixed at a point P, and the other 12 are constrained to a distance of 2 meters from P. Each particle has a charge of +2e.\n\nTo find the minimum energy of this system, we must calculate the total electrostatic potential energy of the configuration where the 12 mobile charges arrange themselves to minimize this energy.\n\n### Breakdown of the Energy Calculation\n\nThe total potential energy (`E_total`) is the sum of the potential energies of all unique pairs of charges in the system. This can be divided into two main components:\n1.  **Interaction Energy between the central charge and the 12 shell charges (`E_c-s`)**: This is the energy due to the interaction of the charge at P with each of the 12 charges on the spherical shell.\n2.  **Interaction Energy among the 12 shell charges (`E_s-s`)**: This is the energy due to the mutual repulsion of the 12 charges on the surface of the sphere.\n\n### The Arrangement of Charges\n\nThe 12 charges on the sphere will move to positions that minimize the total energy. The central charge exerts an equal potential on all points of the sphere, so it does not influence the relative positions of the 12 charges. They will arrange themselves to minimize their own mutual repulsion energy, `E_s-s`. This is a well-known problem in physics called the **Thomson problem**. For 12 charges, the minimum energy configuration is achieved when they are at the vertices of a regular icosahedron.\n\n### Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe potential energy `U` between two point charges `q1` and `q2` separated by a distance `d` is given by:\n`U = k * (q1 * q2) / d`\nwhere `k` is Coulomb's constant.\n\n**1. Energy of Central-Shell Interaction (`E_c-s`)**\n\n*   Charge of each particle, `q = 2e`\n*   Distance from the center P to each of the 12 charges, `r = 2 m`\n*   Coulomb's constant, `k ≈ 8.98755 × 10^9 N·m²/C²`\n*   Elementary charge, `e ≈ 1.602176634 × 10^-19 C`\n\nThe energy between the central charge and one shell charge is `k * q² / r`. Since there are 12 such charges:\n`E_c-s = 12 * (k * q² / r)`\n\n**2. Energy of Shell-Shell Interaction (`E_s-s`)**\n\nThe energy of the 12 charges at the vertices of an icosahedron is the sum of the potential energies for all 66 pairs. This can be expressed as:\n`E_s-s = (k * q² / r) * C_12`\nwhere `C_12` is a dimensionless constant representing the sum of reciprocal distances between vertices for an icosahedron inscribed in a unit-radius sphere.\n\nThe value of `C_12` has been calculated from the geometry of the icosahedron to be approximately **49.1653**.\n\n**3. Total Energy (`E_total`)**\n\nThe total minimum energy of the system is the sum of these two components:\n`E_total = E_c-s + E_s-s`\n`E_total = 12 * (k * q² / r) + (k * q² / r) * C_12`\n`E_total = (k * q² / r) * (12 + C_12)`\n\n### Numerical Calculation\n\nLet's plug in the values:\n*   `k ≈ 8.98755 × 10^9 N·m²/C²`\n*   `q = 2 * (1.602176634 × 10^-19 C) = 3.204353268 × 10^-19 C`\n*   `q² ≈ 1.026788 × 10^-37 C²`\n*   `r = 2 m`\n*   `C_12 ≈ 49.1653`\n\nFirst, calculate the term `k * q² / r`:\n`k * q² / r = (8.98755 × 10^9 * 1.026788 × 10^-37) / 2`\n`k * q² / r ≈ 4.61445 × 10^-28 J`\n\nNow, use this to find the total energy:\n`E_total = (4.61445 × 10^-28) * (12 + 49.1653)`\n`E_total = (4.61445 × 10^-28) * (61.1653)`\n`E_total ≈ 2.82234 × 10^-26 J`\n\nRounding to three decimal places, the minimum energy is **2.822 x 10⁻²⁶ J**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
