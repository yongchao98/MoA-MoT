    "To determine the mass dimension of Îº and the renormalizability of the theory, we first need to establish the mass dimensions of all components in the interaction Lagrangian, $\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}$. In quantum field theory, using natural units where $\\hbar = c = 1$, the action $S = \\int d^4x \\mathcal{L}$ is dimensionless. Since the spacetime element $d^4x$ has a mass dimension of [length]$^4$ or [mass]$^{-4}$, the Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}$ must have a mass dimension of 4.\n\n1.  **Mass Dimension of the Fields:**\n    *   **Fermion field ($\\psi$)**: The kinetic term for a fermion in the Lagrangian is $\\bar{\\psi}i\\gamma^\\mu\\partial_\\mu\\psi$. For this term to have a mass dimension of 4, and knowing that the derivative $\\partial_\\mu$ has a mass dimension of 1, the fermion fields $\\bar{\\psi}$ and $\\psi$ must each have a mass dimension of 3/2. This is because $[\\bar{\\psi}] + [\\psi] + [\\partial_\\mu] = 4$, which leads to $2[\\psi] + 1 = 4$, so $[\\psi]=3/2$.\n    *   **Electromagnetic field strength tensor ($F^{\\mu\\nu}$)**: This tensor is derived from the vector potential $A_\\mu$ as $F_{\\mu\\nu} = \\partial_\\mu A_\\nu - \\partial_\\nu A_\\mu$. The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field in the Lagrangian is $-\\frac{1}{4}F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$. For this term to have a mass dimension of 4, the field strength tensor $F^{\\mu\\nu}$ must have a mass dimension of 2. This comes from $2[F^{\\mu\\nu}] = 4$.\n    *   **Sigma tensor ($\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$)**: The term $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}=\\frac{i}{2}\\left[\\gamma_{\\mu},\\gamma_{\\nu}\\right]$ is composed of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless constants. Therefore, $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$ is dimensionless.\n\n2.  **Mass Dimension of the Coupling Constant ($\\kappa$):**\n    The entire interaction term $\\mathcal{L}_{int}$ must have a mass dimension of 4. We can write the dimensional equation as:\n    $[\\mathcal{L}_{int}] = [\\kappa] + [\\bar{\\psi}] + [\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}] + [\\psi] + [F^{\\mu\\nu}] = 4$\n\n    Substituting the known dimensions:\n    $[\\kappa] + \\frac{3}{2} + 0 + \\frac{3}{2} + 2 = 4$\n    $[\\kappa] + 3 + 2 = 4$\n    $[\\kappa] + 5 = 4$\n    $[\\kappa] = -1$\n\n    Thus, the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\\kappa$ is -1.\n\n3.  **Renormalizability of the Theory:**\n    The renormalizability of a quantum field theory can be determined by the mass dimension of its coupling constants.\n    *   If a coupling constant has a positive mass dimension, the theory is super-renormalizable.\n    *   If a coupling constant is dimensionless (mass dimension 0), the theory is renormalizable.\n    *   If a coupling constant has a negative mass dimension, the theory is non-renormalizable.\n\n    Since the mass dimension of $\\kappa$ is -1, the theory is non-renormalizable. This is because interactions with negative mass dimension couplings become increasingly significant at high energies, leading to an infinite number of divergences that cannot be absorbed by a finite number of renormalization constants.\n\nCombining these findings, the mass dimension of $\\kappa$ is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable.\n\n<<<B>>>"
