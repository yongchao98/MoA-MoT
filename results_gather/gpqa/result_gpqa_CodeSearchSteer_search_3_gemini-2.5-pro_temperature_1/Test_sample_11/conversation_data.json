    "To find the kinetic energies of the product particles in the decay of a stationary positive pion (Pi+), we apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\nThe decay process is:\nPi(+) → mu(+) + nu\n\nGiven:\n*   Rest mass of Pi+ (m_π) = 139.6 MeV/c²\n*   Rest mass of mu+ (m_μ) = 105.7 MeV/c²\n*   The rest mass of the neutrino (m_ν) is considered to be zero.\n*   The initial Pi+ particle is stationary, so its initial momentum is zero.\n\n**1. Conservation of Momentum:**\nSince the pion is at rest, the total momentum before the decay is zero. Therefore, the total momentum of the products must also be zero. This means the muon (mu+) and the neutrino (nu) must travel in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitudes.\n\np_μ = p_ν\n\n**2. Conservation of Energy:**\nThe total energy before the decay is the rest energy of the pion. The total energy after the decay is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n\nE_π = E_μ + E_ν\n\nThe total energy of a particle is the sum of its rest mass energy and its kinetic energy (KE).\n*   E_π = m_π * c² (since it's at rest)\n*   E_μ = KE_μ + m_μ * c²\n*   E_ν = KE_ν (since neutrino mass is zero)\n\nSo, the energy conservation equation is:\nm_π * c² = (KE_μ + m_μ * c²) + KE_ν\n\n**3. Relativistic Kinematics:**\nWe use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E² = (pc)² + (m*c²)².\n\n*   For the muon: E_μ² = (p_μc)² + (m_μc²)²\n*   For the neutrino (mass ≈ 0): E_ν = p_νc\n\nFrom momentum conservation, p_μc = p_νc, which means E_ν = p_μc.\n\nNow, we can solve for the total energy of the muon (E_μ):\n1.  From energy conservation: E_μ = m_πc² - E_ν\n2.  Substitute E_ν = p_μc: E_μ = m_πc² - p_μc  =>  p_μc = m_πc² - E_μ\n3.  Substitute this into the muon's energy-momentum relation:\n    E_μ² = (m_πc² - E_μ)² + (m_μc²)²\n    E_μ² = (m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)E_μ + E_μ² + (m_μc²)²\n4.  Simplify and solve for E_μ:\n    2(m_πc²)E_μ = (m_πc²)² + (m_μc²)²\n    E_μ = [(m_πc²)² + (m_μc²)²] / [2(m_πc²)]\n\n**Calculations:**\nUsing the given rest mass energies:\n*   E_μ = [(139.6)² + (105.7)²] / [2 * 139.6]\n*   E_μ = [19488.16 + 11172.49] / 279.2\n*   E_μ = 30660.65 / 279.2 ≈ 109.816 MeV\n\n**Kinetic Energy of the Muon (KE_μ):**\nKE_μ = E_μ - m_μc²\nKE_μ = 109.816 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 4.116 MeV\nThis rounds to **4.12 MeV**.\n\n**Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino (KE_ν):**\nUsing the energy conservation principle:\nKE_ν = E_ν = m_πc² - E_μ\nKE_ν = 139.6 MeV - 109.816 MeV = 29.784 MeV\nThis rounds to **29.8 MeV**.\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies for the muon and the neutrino are approximately 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV, respectively. This matches one of the given options.\n\n<<<D>>>"
