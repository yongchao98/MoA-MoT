    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product:\n\n**1. Identification of the Starting Compound**\n\nThe molecular formula is C8H9NO, and the 1H-NMR data provides the following signals:\n*   **Analysis of the Degree of Unsaturation:** The formula C8H9NO has 5 degrees of unsaturation, which strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (4 degrees) and one additional double bond (e.g., a carbonyl group, C=O).\n*   **Analysis of the 1H-NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet multiplicity indicates it is adjacent to a methylene (-CH2-) group.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals in the aromatic region are characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is typical for a primary amine (-NH2). The presence of the electron-donating amine group on the ring explains the upfield shift of the aromatic protons.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** A doublet for two protons, consistent with a benzylic methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to the aldehyde proton.\n*   **Conclusion for Starting Material:** Assembling these fragments leads to the structure **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. This structure is consistent with both the molecular formula and all the NMR data.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO2 + HCl**\n    This is a standard diazotization reaction. The primary aromatic amine (-NH2) is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-). The product after this step is (4-(formylmethyl)phenyl)diazonium chloride.\n\n*   **Step 2: H2O, Heat**\n    The diazonium salt is treated with water and heated, which replaces the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group (-OH). This reaction forms **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    This step involves treating 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (KOH) and heat. These are the classic conditions for an aldol condensation reaction. Since heat is applied, the reaction proceeds through both an aldol addition and a subsequent dehydration.\n    1.  **Aldol Addition:** A base-generated enolate of one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde attacks the carbonyl group of a second molecule. This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, specifically 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal (Option C).\n    2.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** Because the reaction is heated, the initially formed β-hydroxy aldehyde eliminates a molecule of water to form a more stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\nThe final product after the elimination of water is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\nLet's compare this with the given options:\n*   A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect structure; lacks hydroxyl groups and the double bond is in the wrong position.\n*   B) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: This matches the expected product from the aldol condensation of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n*   C) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the intermediate aldol addition product before dehydration. Since heat is applied, this is not the final product.\n*   D) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect structure resulting from a different type of reaction.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<B>>>"
