    "In a synthetic organic chemistry lab, the phrase \"my compounds are on top of each other\" is a common way to describe a failed or poor separation. This most often refers to the results of a chromatography experiment, such as Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) or column chromatography.\n\nThese techniques are used to separate components of a mixture based on their differing polarities. In TLC, for example, a mixture is spotted onto a plate coated with a polar stationary phase (like silica gel). A solvent, known as the mobile phase, then moves up the plate via capillary action.\n\nCompounds with lower polarity travel further up the plate with the less polar mobile phase, while more polar compounds interact more strongly with the stationary phase and travel shorter distances. This difference in movement results in the separation of the compounds into distinct spots.\n\nWhen a chemist says their compounds are \"on top of each other,\" it means that the compounds in their mixture have very similar polarities. Because of this, they travel at nearly the same rate during chromatography, resulting in spots that overlap or are not resolved from one another. This makes it impossible to isolate the individual pure compounds.\n\n*   **Option A** is incorrect because optical rotation is a physical property measured with a polarimeter and is not related to chromatographic separation.\n*   **Option B** is an indirect explanation. While polarity is a result of non-covalent interactions, the direct property that governs this type of separation is polarity itself.\n*   **Option C** is incorrect because similar boiling points are a problem for separation by distillation, not chromatography. The phrasing is much more characteristic of a chromatographic result.\n*   **Option D** is correct because similar polarities are the direct cause for compounds failing to separate during chromatography, leading a chemist to say they are \"on top of each other.\"\n\n<<<D>>>"
