    "The \"impulse\" approximation in many-body nuclear calculations simplifies complex interactions by assuming that a projectile interacts with a single nucleon within the nucleus as if that nucleon were a free particle. This approximation is underpinned by a set of core assumptions.\n\nThe assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are:\n\n1.  **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons**: This is known as the one-body current assumption. It posits that the interaction is a sum of interactions with each nucleon individually, ignoring more complex multi-nucleon interaction currents.\n2.  **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon**: This implies that the incoming projectile interacts with only one nucleon, and neither the projectile nor the struck nucleon has significant interactions with the other nucleons in the nucleus (the spectators). This neglects final-state interactions.\n3.  **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces**: A key element of this approximation is that the interaction happens over a very short timescale. On this timescale, the potential energy binding the nucleon to the nucleus is considered negligible compared to the energy of the interaction. Therefore, the nucleon is treated as a free particle at the moment of interaction.\n\nThe statement that the quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic is not a foundational assumption of the impulse approximation. The impulse approximation generally operates at the level of nucleons, not their constituent quarks. While relativistic treatments of the nucleons themselves exist within the relativistic impulse approximation (RIA), the internal dynamics of the quarks are a separate consideration.\n\nTherefore, the three assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
