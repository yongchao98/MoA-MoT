    "This is a problem that can be solved by applying the principles of orbital mechanics and the geometry of planetary transits. Here is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Understanding Transit Geometry**: A transit occurs when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view. An occultation is when the planet passes behind the star. Both events require the planet's orbit to be nearly edge-on. The impact parameter, 'b', describes how close to the center of the star the planet appears to pass. It is defined as the projected distance between the planet's and star's centers, divided by the star's radius. A `b` of 0 is a central transit, and a `b` of 1 means the planet's center just skims the star's edge.\n\n2.  **Relating the Two Planets**: The problem states both planets share the same orbital plane. This is a crucial piece of information as it means they have the same orbital inclination (`i`) relative to our line of sight.\n\n3.  **Using Planet 1's Data**: We are given that Planet 1 has an orbital period (P₁) of 3 days and an impact parameter (b₁) of 0.2. The formula for the impact parameter is:\n    `b₁ = (a₁ * cos(i)) / Rₛ`\n    where `a₁` is the semi-major axis of Planet 1, and `Rₛ` is the star's radius.\n\n4.  **Condition for Planet 2's Transit**: For Planet 2 to exhibit a transit and occultation, its center must, at a minimum, pass over the star's disk. This sets the maximum possible impact parameter for Planet 2 (`b₂`) to be 1.\n    `b₂ ≤ 1`\n\n5.  **Finding the Maximum Orbital Distance**: We can express `b₂` in terms of `b₁`.\n    Since `cos(i) = (b₁ * Rₛ) / a₁` from Planet 1's data, we can substitute this into the formula for Planet 2's impact parameter:\n    `b₂ = (a₂ * cos(i)) / Rₛ = a₂/Rₛ * (b₁ * Rₛ / a₁) = b₁ * (a₂ / a₁)`\n\n    Now, we apply the condition `b₂ ≤ 1`:\n    `b₁ * (a₂ / a₁) ≤ 1`\n    To find the maximum possible semi-major axis for Planet 2 (`a₂_max`), we solve for the equality:\n    `a₂_max / a₁ = 1 / b₁ = 1 / 0.2 = 5`\n    This means the second planet can be at most 5 times farther from its star than the first planet and still have its center transit the star.\n\n6.  **Applying Kepler's Third Law**: Kepler's Third Law relates the orbital period (P) to the semi-major axis (a). For two planets orbiting the same star, the law is:\n    `(P₂ / P₁)² = (a₂ / a₁)`³\n    To find the maximum orbital period for Planet 2 (`P₂_max`), we use the maximum ratio of the semi-major axes we just found:\n    `(P₂_max / 3 days)² = 5³ = 125`\n\n7.  **Calculating the Final Answer**:\n    `P₂_max² = 125 * (3 days)² = 125 * 9 = 1125`\n    `P₂_max = √1125`\n    `P₂_max ≈ 33.54` days\n\nThe maximum orbital period for the second planet to exhibit both transit and occultation events is approximately 33.5 days. The radii of the star and the planets were not needed for this calculation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
