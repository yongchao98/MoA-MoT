    "To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we need to compare their luminosities (L1 / L2).\n\n### Key Principles\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is determined by its radius (R) and its surface temperature (T). The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n2.  **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates the peak emission wavelength (λ_max) of a black body to its absolute temperature (T). The formula is λ_max = b/T, where 'b' is Wien's constant. This means that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature.\n3.  **Doppler Effect for Light:** The observed wavelength of light from a moving source is shifted depending on its velocity relative to the observer. For a source moving away, the observed wavelength (λ_obs) is longer than the rest-frame wavelength (λ_rest). For non-relativistic speeds, the relationship is approximately λ_obs / λ_rest = 1 + (v/c), where 'v' is the radial velocity and 'c' is the speed of light.\n\n### Calculation Steps\n\n1.  **Luminosity Ratio:** We can set up a ratio of the luminosities of the two stars using the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    *   L1 / L2 = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n    *   Simplifying by canceling the constants (4, π, σ), we get:\n        L1 / L2 = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n2.  **Radius Ratio:** The problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2.\n    *   R₁ = 1.5 * R₂\n    *   Therefore, the ratio R₁/R₂ = 1.5.\n\n3.  **Temperature Ratio:** This requires combining Wien's Law and the Doppler effect.\n    *   The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same (λ_obs1 = λ_obs2).\n    *   For Star_1, the radial velocity is 0 km/s, so its observed wavelength is its true, rest-frame wavelength: λ_obs1 = λ_rest1.\n    *   For Star_2, the radial velocity is 700 km/s. We must account for the Doppler shift to find its rest-frame wavelength. Since it's moving, its light is redshifted. The formula connects the observed and rest wavelengths: λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Since λ_obs1 = λ_obs2, we have: λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Now, we apply Wien's Law (λ_rest = b/T) to each star:\n        b/T₁ = (b/T₂) * (1 + v₂/c)\n    *   This simplifies to: 1/T₁ = (1/T₂) * (1 + v₂/c), which means T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c).\n    *   Using the values v₂ = 700 km/s and c = 300,000 km/s, we get:\n        T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + 700/300000) ≈ 1 / 1.002333\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:** Substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio formula:\n    *   L1 / L2 = (1.5)² * [1 / (1.002333)]⁴\n    *   L1 / L2 = 2.25 * (1 / 1.00935)\n    *   L1 / L2 ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is approximately 2.23. The information about the stars' masses is not needed for this calculation.\n\nThe luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.23.\n\n<<<D>>>"
