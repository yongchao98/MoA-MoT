    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Normalize the Initial State**\n\nThe initial state of the system is given by the column matrix:\n|ψ⟩ = `[[-1], [2], [1]]`\n\nFirst, we need to normalize this state vector. The squared norm is:\n⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6\n\nThe normalized state vector, |ψ_norm⟩, is:\n|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * `[[-1], [2], [1]]`\n\n**2. First Measurement: Operator P**\n\nThe operator P is given by the matrix:\nP = `[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n\nWe are interested in the outcome of measuring P and getting the value 0. This value corresponds to an eigenvalue of P. Let's find the eigenvector |p₀⟩ corresponding to the eigenvalue λ = 0.\n\nThe eigenvector equation is P|p₀⟩ = 0|p₀⟩.\n`[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]` * `[[x], [y], [z]]` = `[[0], [0], [0]]`\n\nThis gives the system of equations:\n1.  (1/√2)y = 0  => y = 0\n2.  (1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0 => x + z = 0 => x = -z\n\nThe un-normalized eigenvector is `[[1], [0], [-1]]`.\nNormalizing this eigenvector: 1² + 0² + (-1)² = 2.\nThe normalized eigenvector |p₀⟩ is:\n|p₀⟩ = (1/√2) * `[[1], [0], [-1]]`\n\n**3. Probability of Measuring P = 0**\n\nThe probability of measuring the eigenvalue 0 for P is the squared magnitude of the projection of the normalized initial state onto the corresponding eigenvector |p₀⟩.\nProb(P=0) = |⟨p₀|ψ_norm⟩|²\n\n⟨p₀|ψ_norm⟩ = [(1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]] . [(1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]]\n⟨p₀|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√12) * [1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1]\n⟨p₀|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√12) * (-1 - 1) = -2/√12 = -2/(2√3) = -1/√3\n\nProb(P=0) = |-1/√3|² = 1/3\n\n**4. State Collapse**\n\nAfter measuring P and obtaining the value 0, the state of the system collapses to the corresponding eigenvector |p₀⟩. The new state of the system, |ψ'⟩, is:\n|ψ'⟩ = |p₀⟩ = (1/√2) * `[[1], [0], [-1]]`\n\n**5. Second Measurement: Operator Q**\n\nThe operator Q is given by the matrix:\nQ = `[[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]]`\n\nWe want to find the probability of measuring Q and getting the value -1. Since Q is a diagonal matrix, its eigenvalues are the diagonal elements (1, 0, -1), and its eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.\nThe eigenvector |q₋₁⟩ corresponding to the eigenvalue λ = -1 is:\n|q₋₁⟩ = `[[0], [0], [1]]`\n\n**6. Probability of Measuring Q = -1**\n\nThe probability of measuring Q = -1 is the squared magnitude of the projection of the new state |ψ'⟩ onto the eigenvector |q₋₁⟩.\nProb(Q=-1 after P=0) = |⟨q₋₁|ψ'⟩|²\n\n⟨q₋₁|ψ'⟩ = . [(1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]]\n⟨q₋₁|ψ'⟩ = (1/√2) * [0*1 + 0*0 + 1*(-1)] = -1/√2\n\nProb(Q=-1 after P=0) = |-1/√2|² = 1/2\n\n**7. Total Probability**\n\nThe probability of the sequence of events (measuring P=0 and then measuring Q=-1) is the product of the individual probabilities:\nTotal Probability = Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1 after P=0)\nTotal Probability = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6\n\nTherefore, the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements is 1/6.\n\n<<<A>>>"
