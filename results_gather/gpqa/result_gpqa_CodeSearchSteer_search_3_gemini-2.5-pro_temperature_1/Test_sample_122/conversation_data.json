    "This problem requires the application of the special theory of relativity, specifically the concept of time dilation.\n\n### 1. Identify the Given Information:\n*   **Velocity (v):** The ejecta and the center of the Galaxy are moving towards each other at 60,000 km/s. This is the relative velocity between the two inertial frames of reference.\n*   **Proper Time (Δt₀):** 50 seconds is the time measured in the ejecta's own reference frame. Time measured in a moving frame of reference is known as proper time.\n*   **Speed of Light (c):** For calculations, the speed of light is approximated as 300,000 km/s.\n\n### 2. The Goal:\nThe question asks for the distance traveled by the ejecta as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame. To find this distance, we need to know the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt) and multiply it by the velocity (v).\n\n### 3. Time Dilation:\nAccording to special relativity, an observer in a stationary frame will measure a longer time interval for events occurring in a moving frame. This phenomenon is called time dilation. The formula for time dilation is:\n\nΔt = γ * Δt₀\n\nwhere:\n*   Δt is the time observed in the stationary frame (the Galaxy).\n*   Δt₀ is the proper time observed in the moving frame (the ejecta), which is 50 s.\n*   γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n### 4. Calculation Steps:\n\n**a. Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):**\nThe Lorentz factor is calculated using the formula:\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nFirst, find the ratio of the velocity to the speed of light:\nv/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2\n\nNow, square this value:\n(v/c)² = (0.2)² = 0.04\n\nSubstitute this into the Lorentz factor formula:\nγ = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √0.96\n\n**b. Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt):**\nUsing the time dilation formula:\nΔt = Δt₀ / √0.96 = 50 s / √0.96\n\n**c. Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame (d):**\nThe distance is the velocity multiplied by the time measured in the Galaxy's frame:\nd = v * Δt\nd = 60,000 km/s * (50 s / √0.96)\nd = 3,000,000 km / √0.96\n\nNow, we calculate the final value:\n√0.96 ≈ 0.9798\nd ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798\nd ≈ 3,061,862 km\n\nThis calculated distance is closest to the multiple-choice option B. The non-relativistic calculation (60,000 km/s * 50 s) would yield 3,000,000 km (Option A), but time dilation means the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame is longer, resulting in a greater distance traveled.\n\nTherefore, the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame is approximately 3,060,000 km.\n\n<<<B>>>"
