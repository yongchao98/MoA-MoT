    "To determine the number of revolutions the proton makes in the synchrocyclotron, we need to calculate the energy gained per revolution and divide the final kinetic energy by this value.\n\nThe key steps are as follows:\n1.  **Determine the energy gain per revolution.** A proton in a synchrocyclotron is accelerated twice per revolution as it crosses the gap between the two \"dee\" electrodes. The energy gained at each crossing depends on the accelerating voltage at that moment. The voltage is given by $U(t) = U_0 \\cos(2\\pi\\nu t + \\Phi_0)$. In a synchrocyclotron, particles are accelerated at a stable, synchronous phase, which we can assume to be the given initial phase $\\Phi_0 = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$. The energy gained per crossing is therefore $\\Delta T_{cross} = e U_0 \\cos(\\Phi_0)$, where *e* is the elementary charge.\n2.  **Calculate the total energy gain per revolution.** Since there are two accelerations per revolution, the total energy gain per revolution is $\\Delta T_{rev} = 2 \\times \\Delta T_{cross} = 2 e U_0 \\cos(\\Phi_0)$.\n3.  **Calculate the total number of revolutions.** The total number of revolutions, *N*, is the final kinetic energy, $T_1$, divided by the energy gained per revolution, $\\Delta T_{rev}$.\n\nGiven data:\n*   Final kinetic energy, $T_1 = 950 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n*   Peak voltage, $U_0 = 190 \\, \\text{kV} = 190 \\times 10^3 \\, \\text{V}$\n*   Synchronous phase, $\\Phi_0 = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nFirst, we calculate the energy gain per revolution in electronvolts (eV), since the charge of the proton is 1*e*.\n$\\Delta T_{rev} = 2 \\times (1e) \\times (190 \\times 10^3 \\, \\text{V}) \\times \\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{4})$\n$\\Delta T_{rev} = 380 \\times 10^3 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\, \\text{eV}$\n$\\Delta T_{rev} = 190 \\sqrt{2} \\times 10^3 \\, \\text{eV} = 190 \\sqrt{2} \\, \\text{keV}$\n\nNext, we convert the final kinetic energy to keV:\n$T_1 = 950 \\, \\text{MeV} = 950 \\times 10^3 \\, \\text{keV}$\n\nFinally, we calculate the number of revolutions, *N*:\n$N = \\frac{T_1}{\\Delta T_{rev}} = \\frac{950 \\times 10^3 \\, \\text{keV}}{190 \\sqrt{2} \\, \\text{keV}}$\n$N = \\frac{9500}{19\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{500}{\\sqrt{2}} = 250\\sqrt{2}$\n\nUsing the approximation $\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.4142$:\n$N \\approx 250 \\times 1.4142 = 3535.5$\n\nSince the number of revolutions must be an integer, and after 3535 revolutions the proton has not yet reached the final energy, it must complete another revolution. Therefore, the total number of revolutions is 3536.\n\nAn alternative calculation would be to assume the particle is always accelerated at the peak voltage, which corresponds to a synchronous phase of 0. In this case, $\\cos(0) = 1$, and the energy gain per revolution is $\\Delta T_{rev} = 2 e U_0 = 380 \\, \\text{keV}$. The number of revolutions would be $N = \\frac{950,000 \\, \\text{keV}}{380 \\, \\text{keV}} = 2500$. However, the principle of phase stability in a synchrocyclotron requires a synchronous phase that is not at the peak of the voltage waveform to keep the beam stable. Since a specific phase, $\\Phi_0 = \\pi/4$, is provided, it should be used in the calculation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
