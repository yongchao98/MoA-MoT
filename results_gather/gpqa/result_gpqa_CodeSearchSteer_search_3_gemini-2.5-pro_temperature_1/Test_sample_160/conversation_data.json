    "To determine the relationship between λ1 (the mean free path of gas molecules) and λ2 (the mean free path of electrons scattering off gas molecules), we need to analyze the underlying physics of each phenomenon.\n\n### Analysis of the Mean Free Path\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. Its general formula is inversely proportional to the number density of target particles (n) and the collision cross-section (σ).\n\n1.  **λ1: Mean Free Path of Gas Molecules**\n    This refers to the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with another gas molecule. The formula is:\n    λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gas)\n    Here, 'n' is the number density of the gas molecules and 'σ_gas' is the kinetic collision cross-section for a gas molecule with another, which is related to the molecule's physical size (σ_gas = πd², where d is the molecular diameter). The √2 factor accounts for the relative motion of the colliding molecules.\n\n2.  **λ2: Mean Free Path of Electrons**\n    This refers to the average distance a high-energy electron travels before scattering off a gas molecule. The formula is:\n    λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_e)\n    In this case, 'n' is the same gas molecule number density, but 'σ_e' is the scattering cross-section for an electron with a gas molecule. The √2 factor is absent because the gas molecules are essentially stationary compared to the highly energetic electrons (1000 keV) in the TEM.\n\n### Comparing the Collision Cross-Sections\n\nThe crucial difference lies in the cross-sections, 'σ_gas' versus 'σ_e':\n*   **σ_gas (Molecule-Molecule):** This is the kinetic cross-section, representing the effective target area one molecule presents to another. It's based on their physical diameters.\n*   **σ_e (Electron-Molecule):** This is the scattering cross-section. A high-energy electron is a point-like particle that can pass through the electron cloud of a gas molecule. A collision or scattering event only occurs with a close interaction with the atomic nucleus or the inner-shell electrons. For a fast-moving electron, the gas molecule presents a much smaller effective target than it does for another, slower-moving molecule of similar size. Therefore, the electron-molecule scattering cross-section (σ_e) is significantly smaller than the molecule-molecule kinetic cross-section (σ_gas).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince the mean free path is inversely proportional to the cross-section, a smaller cross-section results in a longer mean free path.\n\n*   Because σ_e < σ_gas, it follows that λ2 will be larger than λ1.\n\nLet's examine the ratio:\nλ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_e)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gas)] = (√2 * σ_gas) / σ_e\n\nSince σ_gas is considerably larger than σ_e, the ratio (σ_gas / σ_e) is a number greater than 1. Multiplying this by √2 (approximately 1.414) means that λ2 must be significantly larger than λ1.\n\nTherefore, λ2 > 1.414 * λ1.\n\nLooking at the given options:\nA) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation - Incorrect.\nB) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 - This is consistent with our finding that λ2 is greater than 1.414*λ1.\nC) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 - Incorrect, the lower bound is too low.\nD) λ2 < λ1 - Incorrect, this would imply electrons have a shorter path, which contradicts the physics.\n\nThe correct conclusion is that the mean free path for the electrons (λ2) is substantially longer than the mean free path for the gas molecules themselves (λ1).\n\n<<<B>>>"
