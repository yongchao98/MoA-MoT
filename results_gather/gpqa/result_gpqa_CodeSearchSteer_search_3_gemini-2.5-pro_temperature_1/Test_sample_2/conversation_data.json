    "To determine the expectation value of the operator `10σ_z + 5σ_x`, we can calculate the expectation values of `σ_z` and `σ_x` separately and then combine them.\n\nThe spin-half particle is in the state `|ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩`. In vector notation, where `|↑⟩` is `[1, 0]` and `|↓⟩` is `[0, 1]`, the state is:\n`|ψ⟩ = [0.5, √3/2]`\n\nThe bra vector `⟨ψ|` is the conjugate transpose:\n`⟨ψ| = [0.5, √3/2]`\n\nThe Pauli matrices `σ_z` and `σ_x` are represented as:\n`σ_z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`\n`σ_x = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\n\n**1. Calculate the expectation value of σ_z:**\n\nThe expectation value `⟨σ_z⟩` is given by the formula `⟨ψ|σ_z|ψ⟩`.\n\nFirst, we apply `σ_z` to `|ψ⟩`:\n`σ_z|ψ⟩ = [[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [0.5, √3/2] = [1*0.5 + 0*(√3/2), 0*0.5 + (-1)*(√3/2)] = [0.5, -√3/2]`\n\nNext, we calculate the inner product with `⟨ψ|`:\n`⟨σ_z⟩ = ⟨ψ|σ_z|ψ⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [0.5, -√3/2]`\n`⟨σ_z⟩ = (0.5 * 0.5) + (√3/2 * -√3/2) = 0.25 - 3/4 = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5`\n\n**2. Calculate the expectation value of σ_x:**\n\nSimilarly, the expectation value `⟨σ_x⟩` is `⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩`.\n\nFirst, apply `σ_x` to `|ψ⟩`:\n`σ_x|ψ⟩ = [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * [0.5, √3/2] = [0*0.5 + 1*(√3/2), 1*0.5 + 0*(√3/2)] = [√3/2, 0.5]`\n\nNext, calculate the inner product with `⟨ψ|`:\n`⟨σ_x⟩ = ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [√3/2, 0.5]`\n`⟨σ_x⟩ = (0.5 * √3/2) + (√3/2 * 0.5) = √3/4 + √3/4 = 2√3/4 = √3/2`\n\n**3. Calculate the total expectation value:**\n\nThe operator is `10σ_z + 5σ_x`. Due to the linearity of expectation values, we have:\n`⟨10σ_z + 5σ_x⟩ = 10⟨σ_z⟩ + 5⟨σ_x⟩`\n\nSubstitute the calculated values:\n`⟨O⟩ = 10 * (-0.5) + 5 * (√3/2) = -5 + 2.5√3`\n\nNow, we use the approximation `√3 ≈ 1.732`:\n`⟨O⟩ ≈ -5 + 2.5 * 1.732 = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67`\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the expectation value is -0.7.\n\n<<<B>>>"
