    "To identify the unknown compound, we must analyze the provided spectral data and compare it to the structures of the four possible options.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H bond in a carboxylic acid, broadened by hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) bond in a carboxylic acid.\n    *   This information confirms the compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data is consistent with all of them.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds, which is consistent with all four proposed structures.\n    *   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This complex splitting pattern arises when a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   One adjacent proton (giving a **d**oublet).\n        *   A group of two equivalent adjacent protons (giving a **t**riplet).\n        *   A group of three equivalent adjacent protons (giving a **q**uartet).\n    *   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This pattern occurs when a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   One adjacent proton (giving a **d**oublet).\n        *   A group of two equivalent adjacent protons (giving a **t**riplet).\n        *   Another, non-equivalent group of two adjacent protons (giving another **t**riplet).\n\nThe key to identifying the compound is to find the structure that possesses two different protons matching these complex splitting patterns.\n\n### Analysis of the Potential Compounds\n\nLet's analyze the expected splitting patterns for the protons in each candidate molecule. The splitting of a signal can be predicted using the n+1 rule, where n is the number of equivalent adjacent protons. For complex cases, these effects are multiplicative.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the proton at C2 (doublet), the CH₂ group at C4 (triplet), and the CH₃ group on C3 (quartet). This would result in a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    *   However, no other proton in this molecule would produce a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt). Therefore, A is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the proton at C2 (doublet), the CH₂ group of the ethyl substituent at C3 (triplet), and the CH₂ group at C4 (triplet). This would result in a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n    *   No proton in this molecule would produce a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq). Therefore, B is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the proton at C4 (doublet), the CH₂ group at C2 (triplet), and the CH₃ group at C3 (quartet). This would give a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    *   No proton in this molecule would produce a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt). Therefore, C is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid):**\n    Let's analyze the structure `CH₃-CH(Et)-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`.\n    *   **Proton at C4:** This proton (H-C4) is coupled to the CH₃ group at C5 (quartet), the proton at C3 (doublet), and the CH₂ of the ethyl group attached to C4 (triplet). This matches the **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)** signal.\n    *   **Proton at C3:** This proton (H-C3) is coupled to the proton at C4 (doublet), the CH₂ group at C2 (triplet), and the CH₂ of the ethyl group attached to C3 (triplet). This matches the **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)** signal.\n\nSince molecule D is the only structure that contains protons corresponding to both of the observed complex splitting patterns, it is the correct identification for the unknown compound.\n\n<<<D>>>"
