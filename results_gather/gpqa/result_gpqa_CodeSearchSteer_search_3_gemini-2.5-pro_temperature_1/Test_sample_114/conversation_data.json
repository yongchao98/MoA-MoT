    "To determine the angle between the two photons produced in the electron-positron annihilation, we must apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n### Analysis of the Collision\n\nFirst, we calculate the total energy and momentum of the system before the collision. The energy (E) and momentum (p) of a relativistic particle are given by E = γmc² and p = sqrt(γ² - 1)mc, where 'm' is the rest mass, 'c' is the speed of light, and 'γ' is the Lorentz factor.\n\n**Before the Collision:**\n\n*   **Electron (e⁻):**\n    *   Lorentz factor (γ_e) = 4\n    *   Energy (E_e) = 4 * m_e * c²\n    *   Momentum (p_e) = sqrt(4² - 1) * m_e * c = sqrt(15) * m_e * c (moving from left, so in the +x direction)\n*   **Positron (e⁺):**\n    *   Lorentz factor (γ_p) = 2\n    *   Energy (E_p) = 2 * m_e * c²\n    *   Momentum (p_p) = sqrt(2² - 1) * m_e * c = sqrt(3) * m_e * c (moving from right, so in the -x direction)\n\n**Total Energy and Momentum Before Collision:**\n\n*   The total energy of the system is the sum of the individual energies.\n    *   E_total = E_e + E_p = 4m_e*c² + 2m_e*c² = 6m_e*c²\n*   The total momentum is the vector sum of the individual momenta. Since they are moving in opposite directions along the horizontal axis:\n    *   p_total = p_e - p_p = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e * c\n\n### Applying Conservation Laws\n\nAccording to the laws of conservation, the total energy and momentum before the annihilation must equal the total energy and momentum after. The annihilation produces two photons.\n\n**After the Collision:**\n\n*   The problem states that the two resulting photons (γ₁) and (γ₂) have the same energy (E_γ).\n*   From the conservation of energy:\n    *   E_total (after) = E_γ + E_γ = 2E_γ\n    *   6m_e*c² = 2E_γ  =>  E_γ = 3m_e*c²\n*   For a photon, momentum (p_γ) is related to its energy by p_γ = E_γ / c.\n    *   p_γ = (3m_e*c²) / c = 3m_e*c\n*   The initial momentum is entirely along the horizontal (x-axis). To conserve momentum, the vertical components of the photons' momenta must cancel out. This means if one photon moves at an angle θ with the horizontal axis, the other must move at an angle -θ.\n*   The total momentum in the x-direction after the collision is the sum of the x-components of each photon's momentum:\n    *   p_total (after) = p_γ * cos(θ) + p_γ * cos(-θ) = 2 * p_γ * cos(θ)\n\n### Calculating the Angle\n\nNow we equate the total momentum before and after the collision:\n*   (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e * c = 2 * (3m_e*c) * cos(θ)\n*   (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) = 6 * cos(θ)\n*   cos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6\n\nUsing the approximate values for the square roots:\n*   sqrt(15) ≈ 3.873\n*   sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732\n*   cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 = 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568\n\nSolving for θ:\n*   θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°\n\nThe question asks for the angle *between* the directions of the two photons, which is 2θ.\n*   Angle = 2 * θ ≈ 2 * 69.1° ≈ 138.2°\n\nThis value is closest to 138.\n\n<<<D>>>"
