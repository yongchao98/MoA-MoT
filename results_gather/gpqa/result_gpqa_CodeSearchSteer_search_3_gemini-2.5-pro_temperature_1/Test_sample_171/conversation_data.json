    "The search results confirm my reasoning.\n\n1.  **Boltzmann Equation**: The ratio of the number of atoms (N) in two different energy states (a and b) is given by the Boltzmann equation. The formula is:\n    N_b / N_a = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-(E_b - E_a) / (k * T)]\n    Here, `g` represents the statistical weights (degeneracy) of the energy levels, `E` is the energy, `k` is the Boltzmann constant, and `T` is the temperature.\n\n2.  **Boltzmann Constant (k)**: The value of the Boltzmann constant is defined as exactly 1.380649 x 10⁻²³ J/K.\n\n3.  **Problem Analysis**:\n    *   The problem compares the excitation of iron atoms in two stars, star_1 (temperature T_1) and star_2 (temperature T_2).\n    *   The phrase \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... when compared to the iron atoms in star_2\" means that the ratio of the population in an excited state (let's call it level 2) to a lower state (level 1) in star 1 is double the same ratio in star 2.\n    *   Let R_1 be the ratio for star 1 and R_2 for star 2. Then R_1 = 2 * R_2.\n    *   R_1 = (N_2 / N_1)_star1 = (g_2 / g_1) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\n    *   R_2 = (N_2 / N_1)_star2 = (g_2 / g_1) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n    *   Substituting these into R_1 = 2 * R_2 gives:\n        (g_2 / g_1) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * (g_2 / g_1) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n    *   The degeneracy term (g_2 / g_1) cancels out:\n        exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n    *   Taking the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n        -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n    *   Rearranging the terms to solve for ln(2):\n        ln(2) = ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1)\n        ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)\n        ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\n4.  **Final Step**:\n    *   The problem gives the energy difference ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J.\n    *   The Boltzmann constant k is approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K.\n    *   Therefore, the ratio (ΔE / k) is approximately 1.\n    *   Substituting this value into the derived equation:\n        ln(2) = 1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n        ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\nThis matches option D. I am confident in this answer.\n\nTo determine which of the provided equations for the effective temperatures of the stars (T_1 and T_2) is correct, we must use the Boltzmann equation, which describes the statistical distribution of atoms in various energy levels under conditions of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation:\n\n1.  **The Boltzmann Equation**: The ratio of the number of atoms in a higher energy level (N_2) to the number of atoms in a lower energy level (N_1) is given by:\n    N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / kT)\n    where:\n    *   `g₁` and `g₂` are the statistical weights of the energy levels.\n    *   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the two levels (E₂ - E₁).\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `T` is the temperature.\n\n2.  **Applying to the Stars**: We are given two stars, star_1 and star_2, with effective temperatures T_1 and T_2, respectively. The problem states that iron atoms in star_1 are \"twice as excited\" as in star_2. This is interpreted as the ratio of populations (N₂/N₁) in star_1 being twice that in star_2.\n\n    For star_1 (temperature T_1):\n    (N₂ / N₁)_₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / kT₁)\n\n    For star_2 (temperature T_2):\n    (N₂ / N₁)_₂ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / kT₂)\n\n3.  **Setting up the Relationship**: According to the problem statement:\n    (N₂ / N₁)_₁ = 2 * (N₂ / N₁)_₂\n\n    Substituting the Boltzmann expressions:\n    (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / kT₁) = 2 * [(g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / kT₂)]\n\n    The statistical weight ratio (g₂ / g₁) is the same for both stars and cancels out:\n    exp(-ΔE / kT₁) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / kT₂)\n\n4.  **Solving for the Temperatures**: To isolate the temperatures, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides of the equation:\n    ln[exp(-ΔE / kT₁)] = ln[2 * exp(-ΔE / kT₂)]\n    -ΔE / kT₁ = ln(2) + ln[exp(-ΔE / kT₂)]\n    -ΔE / kT₁ = ln(2) - ΔE / kT₂\n\n    Rearranging the equation to solve for ln(2):\n    ΔE / kT₂ - ΔE / kT₁ = ln(2)\n\n    Factoring out the common term (ΔE / k):\n    (ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) = ln(2)\n\n    Combining the terms in the parenthesis:\n    (ΔE / k) * [(T₁ - T₂) / (T₁T₂)] = ln(2)\n\n5.  **Using the Given Values**: The problem provides a crucial piece of information: the energy difference ΔE is approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J. The Boltzmann constant, `k`, has a value of approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K. Therefore, the ratio `ΔE / k` is:\n    ΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) = 1 K\n\n    Substituting this value back into our derived equation:\n    1 * [(T₁ - T₂) / (T₁T₂)] = ln(2)\n    ln(2) = [(T₁ - T₂) / (T₁T₂)]\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
