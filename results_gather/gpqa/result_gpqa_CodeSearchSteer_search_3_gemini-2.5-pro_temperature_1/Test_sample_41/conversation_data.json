    "The final calculation is confirmed to be sound. The web search results reinforce the fundamental principles used:\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature:** The search results confirm that the equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is related to its distance from the star (D or `a`), the star's properties, and the planet's albedo (A). Several sources provide the formula, which simplifies to show that T_eq is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance (`a`) when the star and albedo are constant: T_eq ∝ 1/√a. This confirms the relationship used in the derivation: a_y / a_x = (T_eq_x / T_eq_y)².\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law:** Multiple sources state Kepler's Third Law as P² ∝ a³, where P is the orbital period and `a` is the semi-major axis. This means the ratio of orbital periods of two planets around the same star is (P_x / P_y) = (a_x / a_y)^(3/2). This is the exact relationship used in the final step of the calculation.\n\n3.  **Irrelevance of Planet Mass:** The provided information about planet masses and the TTV discovery method is extraneous to the calculation. Kepler's Third Law, in its simplest form, does not depend on the planet's mass, assuming it's negligible compared to the star's mass. The question does not require considering gravitational perturbations between the planets for this specific calculation.\n\nThe calculation steps are as follows:\n\n1.  **Find the ratio of semi-major axes (a2/a1) from the temperature ratio (T_eq1/T_eq2):**\n    *   a2 / a1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2)² = 1.4² = 1.96\n\n2.  **Find the ratio of semi-major axes (a3/a2) from the temperature ratio (T_eq2/T_eq3):**\n    *   a3 / a2 = (T_eq2 / T_eq3)² = 2.3² = 5.29\n\n3.  **Calculate the total ratio of the semi-major axes (a3/a1):**\n    *   a3 / a1 = (a3 / a2) * (a2 / a1) = 5.29 * 1.96 = 10.3684\n\n4.  **Use Kepler's Third Law to find the ratio of the orbital periods (P3/P1):**\n    *   P3 / P1 = (a3 / a1)^(3/2) = (10.3684)^(1.5)\n    *   P3 / P1 ≈ 33.385\n\nThis result is approximately 33.4, which corresponds to option D.\n\nThe problem is a straightforward physics problem disguised with extra, irrelevant information. The logic and calculations hold up.\n\nFinal check of the calculations:\n1.4 * 1.4 = 1.96\n2.3 * 2.3 = 5.29\n1.96 * 5.29 = 10.3684\nsqrt(10.3684) = 3.2200\n10.3684 * 3.2200 = 33.386248\nThe result is robust.\nFinal Answer seems to be D.\n\n```\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Relating Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance:**\n    The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it absorbs from its host star. The formula is:\n    T_eq ∝ ( (1-A) / a² )^(1/4)\n    Where A is the albedo and `a` is the semi-major axis (orbital distance for a circular orbit).\n    Since the albedo (A) is the same for all three planets and they orbit the same star, this simplifies to:\n    T_eq ∝ 1 / a^(1/2)  or T_eq ∝ 1 / sqrt(a)\n\n    Therefore, for any two planets (x and y) in the system, the ratio of their temperatures is related to the ratio of their orbital distances:\n    T_eq_x / T_eq_y = sqrt(a_y / a_x)\n    Squaring both sides gives the relationship for the orbital distance ratio:\n    a_y / a_x = (T_eq_x / T_eq_y)²\n\n2.  **Calculating the Ratios of Orbital Distances:**\n    We apply this formula to the given temperature ratios:\n    *   For Planet 1 and Planet 2:\n        a₂ / a₁ = (T_eq₁ / T_eq₂)² = (1.4)² = 1.96\n    *   For Planet 2 and Planet 3:\n        a₃ / a₂ = (T_eq₂ / T_eq₃)² = (2.3)² = 5.29\n\n3.  **Finding the Orbital Distance Ratio between Planet 3 and Planet 1:**\n    To find the ratio of the orbital distance of Planet 3 to Planet 1 (a₃ / a₁), we multiply the individual ratios:\n    a₃ / a₁ = (a₃ / a₂) * (a₂ / a₁) = 5.29 * 1.96 = 10.3684\n\n4.  **Using Kepler's Third Law to Find the Orbital Period Ratio:**\n    Kepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a). [1, 2, 3]\n    P² ∝ a³\n    Therefore, the ratio of the periods of two planets is:\n    (P_x / P_y)² = (a_x / a_y)³\n    P_x / P_y = (a_x / a_y)^(3/2)\n\n    Applying this to Planet 3 and Planet 1:\n    P₃ / P₁ = (a₃ / a₁)^(3/2) = (10.3684)^(1.5)\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:**\n    P₃ / P₁ = (10.3684) * sqrt(10.3684) ≈ 10.3684 * 3.22 ≈ 33.38\n    This value is approximately 33.4.\n\nThe information about the planets' masses and their discovery via the TTV method is not needed for this calculation, as the planet's mass is negligible in Kepler's Third Law for typical exoplanetary systems.\n\nTherefore, the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 by a factor of approximately 33.4.\n```To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we will use the relationship between a planet's equilibrium temperature, its orbital distance, and its orbital period. The information regarding the masses of the planets and the TTV discovery method is not necessary for this specific calculation.\n\n### Step 1: Relate Equilibrium Temperature to Orbital Distance\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet in a circular orbit around its star is given by the formula:\n\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2a))\n\nWhere:\n*   `T_star` is the star's temperature.\n*   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n*   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (the orbital distance for a circular orbit).\n\nFor two planets orbiting the same star with the same albedo, the terms T_star, R_star, and (1 - A) are constant. Therefore, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance:\n\nT_eq ∝ 1 / √a\n\nFrom this relationship, we can establish a ratio for two planets (x and y):\n\n(T_eq_x / T_eq_y) = √(a_y / a_x)  =>  (a_y / a_x) = (T_eq_x / T_eq_y)²\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Ratios of the Orbital Distances\n\nUsing the given temperature ratios, we can find the ratios of the orbital distances:\n\n*   **For Planet 1 and Planet 2:** The ratio of their equilibrium temperatures is T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 1.4. The ratio of their orbital distances is:\n    a₂ / a₁ = (T_eq₁ / T_eq₂)² = (1.4)² = 1.96\n\n*   **For Planet 2 and Planet 3:** The ratio of their equilibrium temperatures is T_eq2 / T_eq3 ≈ 2.3. The ratio of their orbital distances is:\n    a₃ / a₂ = (T_eq₂ / T_eq₃)² = (2.3)² = 5.29\n\nNow, we can find the ratio of the orbital distance of Planet 3 to Planet 1 (a₃ / a₁) by multiplying the intermediate ratios:\n\na₃ / a₁ = (a₃ / a₂) * (a₂ / a₁) = 5.29 * 1.96 = 10.3684\n\n### Step 3: Use Kepler's Third Law to Find the Orbital Period Ratio\n\nKepler's Third Law states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a).\n\nP² ∝ a³\n\nThis gives us the following relationship for the periods of two planets:\n\n(P_x / P_y) = (a_x / a_y)^(3/2)\n\nWe can now calculate the ratio of the orbital period of Planet 3 to Planet 1:\n\nP₃ / P₁ = (a₃ / a₁)^(3/2) = (10.3684)^(1.5)\n\nP₃ / P₁ ≈ 33.385\n\nThis result is approximately **33.4**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
