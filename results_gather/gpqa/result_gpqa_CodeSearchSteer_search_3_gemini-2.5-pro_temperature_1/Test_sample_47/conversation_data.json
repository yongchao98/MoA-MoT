    "The synthesis of product 4 proceeds through the following four steps:\n\n*   **Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br2)**\n    This reaction is the alpha-bromination of a ketone, which results in the formation of 2-bromocyclohexanone (product 1).\n\n*   **Step 2: 2-bromocyclohexanone heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n    When an Î±-halo ketone with available protons on the other side of the carbonyl group is treated with a strong base like NaOH, it undergoes a Favorskii rearrangement. This reaction involves a ring contraction. In this case, 2-bromocyclohexanone rearranges to form cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (product 2).\n\n*   **Step 3: Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine**\n    This is a standard procedure to convert a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. Thionyl chloride is the chlorinating agent, and pyridine is used as a base. The product is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride (product 3).\n\n*   **Step 4: Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAl(OtBu)3H)**\n    Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a bulky and mild reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce highly reactive acid chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to an alcohol. Therefore, cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride is reduced to cyclopentanecarbaldehyde (product 4).\n\n**Analysis of Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde)**\n\nThe final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\nThe structure of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde (C5H9CHO) features a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO). The carbon atom of the ring bonded to the aldehyde group (C1) is a chiral center. This is because it is attached to four different groups:\n1.  A hydrogen atom\n2.  An aldehyde group (-CHO)\n3.  The C2-C3-C4 portion of the ring\n4.  The C5-C4-C3 portion of the ring\n\nThe presence of this single chiral center makes the entire molecule chiral and removes all elements of symmetry (like planes or axes of symmetry). In a molecule with no symmetry, all protons that cannot be interconverted by bond rotation or a symmetry operation are chemically distinct.\n\nLet's count the hydrogen atoms based on their unique chemical environments:\n*   **Aldehyde proton:** The single proton of the -CHO group is unique. (1 H)\n*   **Methine proton:** The proton on C1 (the chiral center) is in a unique environment. (1 H)\n*   **Ring protons:**\n    *   The two protons on C2 are adjacent to the chiral center, making them diastereotopic and thus chemically different from each other.\n    *   Similarly, the two protons on C5 are diastereotopic and non-equivalent. Because there is no symmetry to interconvert C2 and C5, the C2 protons are also different from the C5 protons.\n    *   The same logic applies to the protons on C3 and C4. The two protons on C3 are diastereotopic, as are the two on C4. C3 is adjacent to the non-equivalent C2, and C4 is adjacent to the non-equivalent C5, making the protons on C3 and C4 distinct from each other.\n\nCounting all the non-equivalent protons:\n*   1 aldehyde proton\n*   1 proton on C1\n*   2 distinct protons on C2\n*   2 distinct protons on C3\n*   2 distinct protons on C4\n*   2 distinct protons on C5\n\nTotal = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 10 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<A>>>"
