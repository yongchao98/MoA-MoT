    "The expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) for a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials are derived from Maxwell's equations and account for the fact that electromagnetic fields propagate at the finite speed of light, `c`.\n\nThe potential at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t` is determined by the state of the charge `q` at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time `tr`. The retarded time is defined by the condition that the time elapsed (`t - tr`) equals the time it took for the field to travel from the charge's position at `tr` to the observation point, i.e., $t - t_r = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)| / c = d/c$.\n\nThe Liénard-Wiechert potentials are given by the following expressions:\n\nThe scalar potential V is:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n\nAnd the vector potential $\\vec{A}$ is:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n\nIn these expressions, all quantities in the brackets are evaluated at the retarded time `tr`. The terms can be rearranged by multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nComparing these correct formulas with the given options, we find that option B is the correct choice.\n\n<<<B>>>"
