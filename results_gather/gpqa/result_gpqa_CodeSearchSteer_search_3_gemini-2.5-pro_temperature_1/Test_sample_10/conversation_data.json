    "All of the provided statements accurately describe various aspects of SARS-CoV-2 molecular biology, with the exception of one. After a thorough review of the current scientific literature, the incorrect statement has been identified.\n\n*   **Statement A is correct.** Programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting is a crucial mechanism for coronaviruses. It occurs at a specific \"slippery sequence\" and is stimulated by a downstream RNA pseudoknot structure, causing the ribosome to shift back by one nucleotide. This allows for the synthesis of two different polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, from the same genomic region. Structural and functional analyses have confirmed that the frameshifting signals of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are highly conserved, promoting similar frameshifting rates and sharing nearly identical conformations.\n\n*   **Statement B is correct.** The accessory protein ORF3a of SARS-CoV-2 is known to induce apoptosis (programmed cell death) in host cells. Studies have shown that it triggers the activation and cleavage of caspase-8, a key initiator of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. Importantly, this action does not affect the expression levels of Bcl-2, a primary regulator of the intrinsic (mitochondrial) apoptotic pathway. This evidence strongly supports the conclusion that ORF3a initiates apoptosis primarily through the extrinsic pathway.\n\n*   **Statement D is correct.** The efficiency of ribosomal frameshifting has been linked to the conformational dynamics of the RNA pseudoknot. Research has shown a correlation between the rate of frameshifting and the number of different conformations the pseudoknot can adopt under tension. The frameshift signals for both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have been observed to adopt two main conformations when placed under tension, which is consistent with other viral pseudoknots that exhibit comparable frameshifting efficiencies.\n\n*   **Statement C is incorrect.** The SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN complex does function as a heterodimer and is essential for a proofreading, or mismatch repair, mechanism. The nsp10 protein activates the N-terminal ExoN (exonuclease) domain of nsp14. However, the function of this active complex is to *degrade* or *break down* RNA, specifically by removing mismatched nucleotides from the 3' end of a newly synthesized RNA strand. It has also been proposed to degrade dsRNA to help the virus evade the host's innate immune response. The statement claims the complex *prevents* the breakdown of dsRNA, which is the exact opposite of its known enzymatic activity.\n\n<<<C>>>"
