    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Normalize the State `|alpha>`\n\nThe given state is `|alpha> ∝ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>`. To make it a valid quantum state, we must normalize it. Let `|alpha> = C * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`. The normalization condition is `<alpha|alpha> = 1`.\n\nThe corresponding bra vector is `<alpha| = C* * [(1-i)<up| + (2+i)<down|]`.\n\nThe inner product is:\n`<alpha|alpha> = |C|^2 * [(1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i)]`\n`<alpha|alpha> = |C|^2 * [|1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2]`\n`<alpha|alpha> = |C|^2 * [(1^2 + 1^2) + (2^2 + (-1)^2)]`\n`<alpha|alpha> = |C|^2 * (2 + 5) = 7|C|^2`\n\nSetting this to 1 gives `7|C|^2 = 1`, so we can choose the real constant `C = 1/sqrt(7)`.\n\nThe normalized state is:\n`|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`\n\nIn vector notation, where `|up> = [1, 0]` and `|down> = [0, 1]`, this is:\n`|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [[1+i], [2-i]]`\n\n### 2. Find the Eigenstates and Eigenvalues of Operator A\n\nThe operator A is defined by its matrix elements: `Aij = hbar/2` for `i ≠ j` and `Aij = 0` for `i = j`. This results in the matrix:\n`A = [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]] = (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (`λ`), we solve the characteristic equation `det(A - λI) = 0`:\n`det([[-λ, hbar/2], [hbar/2, -λ]]) = λ^2 - (hbar/2)^2 = 0`\nThis gives two eigenvalues:\n*   `λ_1 = +hbar/2`\n*   `λ_2 = -hbar/2`\n\nNext, we find the corresponding normalized eigenvectors (`|a_i>`).\n\n**For `λ_1 = +hbar/2`**:\n`[[ -hbar/2, hbar/2 ], [ hbar/2, -hbar/2 ]] * [[x], [y]] = [[0], [0]]`\nThis simplifies to `-x + y = 0`, or `x = y`. The unnormalized eigenvector is `[[1], [1]]`. Normalizing this gives the eigenvector:\n`|a_1> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [[1], [1]]`\n\n**For `λ_2 = -hbar/2`**:\n`[[ hbar/2, hbar/2 ], [ hbar/2, hbar/2 ]] * [[x], [y]] = [[0], [0]]`\nThis simplifies to `x + y = 0`, or `x = -y`. The unnormalized eigenvector is `[[1], [-1]]`. Normalizing this gives the eigenvector:\n`|a_2> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [[1], [-1]]`\n\n### 3. Calculate the Measurement Probabilities\n\nThe probability of measuring an eigenvalue `λ_i` is given by `P_i = |<a_i|alpha>|^2`.\n\n**Probability `P_1` (for `λ_1 = +hbar/2`):**\n`<a_1|alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, 1] * (1/sqrt(7)) * [[1+i], [2-i]]`\n`<a_1|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * [1*(1+i) + 1*(2-i)]`\n`<a_1|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * (3) = 3/sqrt(14)`\n`P_1 = |3/sqrt(14)|^2 = 9/14 ≈ 0.6428`\n\n**Probability `P_2` (for `λ_2 = -hbar/2`):**\n`<a_2|alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, -1] * (1/sqrt(7)) * [[1+i], [2-i]]`\n`<a_2|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * [1*(1+i) - 1*(2-i)]`\n`<a_2|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * (1 + i - 2 + i) = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)`\n`P_2 = |(-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)|^2 = ((-1)^2 + 2^2)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.3571`\n\nSo the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.\n\n### 4. Find the Average (Expectation) Value `<A>`\n\nThe expectation value of an operator is the average of all possible measurement outcomes weighted by their probabilities. It can be calculated as `<A> = <alpha|A|alpha>`.\n\n`A|alpha> = (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * (1/sqrt(7)) * [[1+i], [2-i]]`\n`A|alpha> = (hbar / (2*sqrt(7))) * [[2-i], [1+i]]`\n\nNow, we compute `<alpha|A|alpha>`:\n`<A> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [1-i, 2+i] * (hbar / (2*sqrt(7))) * [[2-i], [1+i]]`\n`<A> = (hbar / 14) * [(1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i)]`\n`<A> = (hbar / 14) * [(2 - 3i - 1) + (2 + 3i - 1)]`\n`<A> = (hbar / 14) * [(1 - 3i) + (1 + 3i)]`\n`<A> = (hbar / 14) * 2 = hbar / 7`\n\nAlternatively, we can use the probabilities and eigenvalues:\n`<A> = P_1*λ_1 + P_2*λ_2`\n`<A> = (9/14)*(hbar/2) + (5/14)*(-hbar/2)`\n`<A> = (hbar/28) * (9 - 5) = 4*hbar/28 = hbar/7`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value of the operator is `hbar/7`. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
