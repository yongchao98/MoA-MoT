    "Based on the principles of organic chemistry, the suitable reagents for the reactions are determined as follows:\n\n**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\nThis reaction is a cyanohydrin formation. The process involves the nucleophilic attack of the cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN on the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms an alkoxide intermediate, which must be protonated to yield the final hydroxyl group (-OH). An acid is required for this protonation step. While the reaction can be carried out under various pH conditions, an acidic workup (represented by H₃O⁺) ensures the formation of the final cyanohydrin product. Therefore, reagent **A** is **H₃O⁺**.\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\nThis reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This transformation is effectively catalyzed by heating the nitrile with a strong acid, such as dilute hydrochloric acid (HCl) or sulfuric acid, in an aqueous solution. A weak acid like acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is generally not sufficient to promote this hydrolysis efficiently. Therefore, reagent **B** is a strong acid like **HCl**.\n\nCombining these findings:\n*   **A = H₃O⁺**\n*   **B = HCl**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
