    "To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X, we need to calculate its momentum and its proper lifetime from the given information.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Concepts\n\n*   **Proper Lifetime (τ):** This is the average lifetime of a particle in its own rest frame. It is inversely related to the decay width (Γ) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: τ = ħ / Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n*   **Mean Decay Distance (L):** This is the average distance a particle travels in the lab frame before it decays. It depends on the particle's velocity (v), its Lorentz factor (γ), and its proper lifetime (τ). The exact formula is L = γ * v * τ. This can also be expressed in terms of the particle's momentum (p) and mass (m) as L = (p/m) * τ.\n\n### 2. Given Information\n\n*   Total energy of the particle, E_X = 8 GeV\n*   Mass of the particle, m_X = 1.2 GeV/c² (In particle physics, mass is often quoted in units of energy, GeV, with c² being implicit).\n*   Decay width of the particle, Γ_X = 320 MeV = 0.320 GeV.\n\n### 3. Calculation Steps\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the particle's momentum (p).**\n\nWe use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n*   E = 8 GeV\n*   m = 1.2 GeV\n\n(pc)² = E² - m² = (8 GeV)² - (1.2 GeV)² = 64 GeV² - 1.44 GeV² = 62.56 GeV²\npc = √62.56 GeV ≈ 7.9095 GeV\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the mean decay distance (L).**\n\nThe most direct formula to use is L = (pc / m) * (ħc / Γ). This formula combines the calculations for lifetime and relativistic motion.\n\n*   pc = √62.56 GeV\n*   m = 1.2 GeV\n*   Γ = 0.320 GeV\n*   The value of ħc (h-bar c) is a physical constant, approximately 197.327 MeV·fm, which is equal to 0.197327 GeV·fm. (1 fm = 10⁻¹⁵ m).\n\nNow, we plug the values into the formula:\n\nL = (√62.56 GeV / 1.2 GeV) * (0.197327 GeV·fm / 0.320 GeV)\nL ≈ (7.9095 / 1.2) * (0.197327 / 0.320) fm\nL ≈ 6.5912 * 0.6166 fm\nL ≈ 4.0655 fm\n\nSince 1 fm = 10⁻¹⁵ meters, the mean decay distance is approximately 4.0655 * 10⁻¹⁵ m.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe calculated mean decay distance matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
