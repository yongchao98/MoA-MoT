    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z:**\n    *   Substance Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This percentage is characteristic of a cycloalkane with the general formula CnH2n.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in a cycloalkane is (2n * 1.008) / (12.011 * n + 2n * 1.008) ≈ 2/14 = 1/7 ≈ 14.3%.\n    *   The problem states that Z is a widely used solvent and is the sole product of the hydrogenation of all components in mixtures X and Y. A very common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane (C6H12). Its hydrogenation would not yield a different product, which is consistent with the information that Z does not react further with hydrogen.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y and its Hydrogenation:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This suggests the components are saturated (like alkanes/cycloalkanes) or aromatic.\n    *   Z (cyclohexane) is a component of Y. Let the other component be D. So, Y = (cyclohexane + D).\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means the hydrogenation of D must also yield cyclohexane.\n    *   If D were a saturated isomer of cyclohexane (like methylcyclopentane), its hydrogenation under severe conditions would likely break the ring and form acyclic alkanes, not exclusively cyclohexane.\n    *   The only common hydrocarbon that does not decolorize bromine water and can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane is **benzene (C6H6)**.\n    *   Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and its reaction to Y:**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (let's call them A and B) that decolorize bromine water, indicating they contain C=C double bonds (alkenes/cycloalkenes).\n    *   X is converted to Y (cyclohexane + benzene) upon heating with platinum. This is described as a disproportionation reaction, which in this context implies a hydrogen transfer.\n    *   The overall reaction is: A + B → C6H12 + C6H6.\n    *   By conservation of atoms, the reactants A and B together must contain 12 carbon atoms and 18 hydrogen atoms (12 from cyclohexane + 6 from benzene).\n    *   Since A and B are in an equimolar mixture and hydrogenation of both yields cyclohexane, they must both be C6 hydrocarbons with different degrees of unsaturation. Let their formulas be C6Hx and C6Hy.\n    *   From the stoichiometry, we have x + y = 18.\n    *   Both A and B are unsaturated C6 cyclic hydrocarbons. Possible candidates include cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexadienes (C6H8).\n    *   The combination C6H10 and C6H8 satisfies the condition x + y = 18 (10 + 8 = 18).\n    *   The problem specifies that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in mixture X. There are two common isomers of cyclohexadiene: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated). Therefore, the diene must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n    *   The other component is **cyclohexene (C6H10)**.\n\n4.  **Confirm the Reaction Pathway:**\n    *   **Mixture X**: An equimolar mixture of cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   **Disproportionation Reaction**: Upon heating with platinum, cyclohexene can be dehydrogenated to benzene, and 1,4-cyclohexadiene can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane. This is a known type of reaction called catalytic hydrogen transfer.\n        *   C6H10 (cyclohexene) → C6H6 (benzene) + 4[H]\n        *   C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) + 4[H] → C6H12 (cyclohexane)\n        *   Net Reaction: C6H10 + C6H8 → C6H6 + C6H12\n    *   This produces an equimolar mixture of benzene and cyclohexane (Mixture Y), which fits all the conditions.\n    *   **Hydrogenation of X**: Hydrogenation of both cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene produces cyclohexane.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   The two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in their respective molecular formulas.\n    *   Total Hydrogen Atoms = (H atoms in C6H10) + (H atoms in C6H8) = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<B>>>"
