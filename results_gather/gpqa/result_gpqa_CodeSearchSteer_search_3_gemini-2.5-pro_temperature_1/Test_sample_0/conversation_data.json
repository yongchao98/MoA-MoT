    "To clearly distinguish between two quantum energy levels, the difference in their energies must be greater than the uncertainty in their energies. The energy uncertainty of a quantum state is related to its lifetime by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle for energy and time.\n\nThe relationship is given by:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n\nwhere:\n*   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy.\n*   Δt is the lifetime of the state.\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\nFor two energy levels to be clearly resolvable, the energy difference between them, |E2 - E1|, must be larger than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties, ΔE1 + ΔE2.  However, a simpler and often used criterion is that the energy difference should be at least as large as the larger of the two energy uncertainties. A state with a shorter lifetime will have a larger energy uncertainty.\n\nFirst, we calculate the energy uncertainty for each state:\n\n**State 1:**\n*   Lifetime (Δt₁) = 10⁻⁹ s\n*   ΔE₁ ≥ ħ / (2 * Δt₁)\n*   ΔE₁ ≥ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (2 * 10⁻⁹ s)\n*   ΔE₁ ≥ 3.291 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**State 2:**\n*   Lifetime (Δt₂) = 10⁻⁸ s\n*   ΔE₂ ≥ ħ / (2 * Δt₂)\n*   ΔE₂ ≥ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (2 * 10⁻⁸ s)\n*   ΔE₂ ≥ 3.291 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nThe energy uncertainty for state 1 (≈ 3.291 x 10⁻⁷ eV) is larger than that of state 2 (≈ 3.291 x 10⁻⁸ eV). To clearly resolve the two levels, the energy difference between them should be at least on the order of the larger uncertainty.\n\nTherefore, the energy difference |E2 - E1| should be greater than approximately 3.291 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nNow let's examine the given options:\nA) 10⁻¹¹ eV\nB) 10⁻⁴ eV\nC) 10⁻⁸ eV\nD) 10⁻⁹ eV\n\nComparing our calculated minimum energy difference with the options, only 10⁻⁴ eV is significantly larger than the energy uncertainty of both states. This larger energy separation ensures that the energy levels can be clearly distinguished.\n\n<<<B>>>"
