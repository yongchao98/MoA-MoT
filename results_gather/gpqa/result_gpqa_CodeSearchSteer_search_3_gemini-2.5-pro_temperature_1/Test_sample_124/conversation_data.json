    "The problem describes a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator. The energy eigenvalues for such a system are given by the formula:\n\nE_n = (n + 3/2)ħω\n\nwhere 'n' is the principal quantum number (n = 0, 1, 2, ...), ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, and ω is the angular frequency.\n\nThe energy levels are:\n*   **Ground State (n=0):** E₀ = (0 + 3/2)ħω = (3/2)ħω\n*   **First Excited State (n=1):** E₁ = (1 + 3/2)ħω = (5/2)ħω\n*   **Second Excited State (n=2):** E₂ = (2 + 3/2)ħω = (7/2)ħω\n*   **Third Excited State (n=3):** E₃ = (3 + 3/2)ħω = (9/2)ħω\n\nSo, the energy of the third excited state is (9/2)ħω.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for this energy level, which is known as the degeneracy of the state. The degeneracy, g_n, for an energy level 'n' of the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is given by the formula:\n\ng_n = (n + 1)(n + 2) / 2\n\nFor the third excited state, n = 3. Plugging this into the degeneracy formula:\n\ng₃ = (3 + 1)(3 + 2) / 2\ng₃ = (4)(5) / 2\ng₃ = 20 / 2\ng₃ = 10\n\nTherefore, the energy of the third excited state is (9/2)ħω, and it has a degeneracy of 10. This corresponds to 10 possible linearly independent eigenfunctions.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) (9/2)ħω, 3\nB) 11 π²ħ² / (2m r²), 10\nC) (9/2)ħω, 10\nD) 11 π²ħ² / (2m r²), 3\n\nThe calculated values match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
