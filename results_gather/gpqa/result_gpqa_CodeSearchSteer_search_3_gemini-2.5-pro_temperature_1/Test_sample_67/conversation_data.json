    "This problem describes a classic case of Larmor precession. When a magnetic moment is placed in a magnetic field, it precesses around the direction of the field. The frequency of this precession is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the situation:\n\n1.  **Initial State**: The particle's spin is aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the spin is in the \"spin up\" state along the Z-axis.\n\n2.  **Sudden Change**: The Z-direction field is turned off and a new field of the same magnitude, B, is turned on along the +Y direction. The spin of the particle does not change instantaneously.\n\n3.  **Precession**: The magnetic moment (and thus the spin) begins to precess around the new magnetic field direction (+Y). This precession occurs at the Larmor frequency.\n\n4.  **Larmor Frequency**: The Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment `μ` in a magnetic field `B` is `H = -μ · B`. For a spin, where `μ = γS` (`γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio and `S` is the spin operator), the Hamiltonian becomes `H = -γS · B`. The equation of motion for the spin shows that it precesses around the magnetic field with an angular frequency `ω = γB`. This is the Larmor frequency.\n\n5.  **Oscillation of the Z-component**: As the spin vector precesses around the Y-axis, its projection onto the Z-axis will change. If the spin vector starts along the Z-axis, it will rotate in the X-Z plane (as it precesses around Y). The value of the z-component will trace out a cosine function over time. The frequency of this oscillation is the same as the precession frequency.\n\nTherefore, the average of the z-component of the particle's moment will oscillate with an angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nB) gamma*B/2\nC) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nD) gamma*B\n\nThe correct oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
