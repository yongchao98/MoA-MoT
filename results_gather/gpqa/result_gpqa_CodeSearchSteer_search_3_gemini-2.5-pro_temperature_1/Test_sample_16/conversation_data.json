    "The initial calculation appears correct based on the principles of equilibrium chemistry. The problem involves the dissociation of a stable complex, Ca-EDTA.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction:** The Ca-EDTA complex ([CaY]²⁻) is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, Ca²⁺ and EDTA (Y⁴⁻).\n    [CaY]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n\n2.  **Define the equilibrium constant:** The problem provides the formation constant (K_f or K_Ca-EDTA), which is for the forward reaction (Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ [CaY]²⁻).\n    K_f = [[CaY]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\n3.  **Set up the equilibrium concentrations:** We start with 0.02 M of the complex. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ that forms from the dissociation. According to the stoichiometry of the dissociation, the concentration of Y⁴⁻ will also be 'x', and the concentration of the complex will decrease by 'x'.\n    *   [[CaY]²⁻] = 0.02 - x\n    *   [Ca²⁺] = x\n    *   [Y⁴⁻] = x\n\n4.  **Substitute into the equilibrium expression:**\n    5 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n\n5.  **Simplify the equation:** Because the formation constant is very large, the equilibrium lies far to the left for the dissociation reaction. This means 'x' will be a very small number compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). Therefore, we can approximate (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n    5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\n6.  **Solve for x:**\n    *   x² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\n    *   x² ≈ (2 x 10⁻²) / (5 x 10¹⁰)\n    *   x² ≈ 0.4 x 10⁻¹²\n    *   x² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n    *   x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\n    *   x = √(40 x 10⁻¹⁴)\n    *   x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe calculated concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M. This matches one of the provided options. The search results confirm that this method of using the formation constant and an ICE table is the correct approach for this type of problem. The assumption of an \"ideal pH\" allows the direct use of the given formation constant (K_f) without correcting for the protonation of EDTA, which would lower the effective formation constant.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) 2.0x10⁻² M\nB) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M\nC) 5.0x10⁻³ M\nD) 1.0x10⁻² M\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
