    "The Mott-Gurney equation is derived based on several key assumptions about the semiconductor device and the charge transport mechanism. Analyzing these assumptions will reveal the correct statement.\n\nThe primary assumptions for the validity of the Mott-Gurney law are:\n*   **Single-carrier device**: The current is assumed to be carried by only one type of charge carrier, either electrons or holes.\n*   **Trap-free**: The model applies to an ideal semiconductor or insulator with no charge traps within the bandgap. If traps are present, the current-voltage relationship is modified, leading to trap-limited SCLC.\n*   **Ohmic contact**: The charge-injecting contact must be Ohmic, meaning it can supply an unlimited number of carriers into the device. This ensures there is no barrier to injection and that the current is limited by the bulk properties of the material (the space charge) rather than by the contact itself. A Schottky contact, which has an injection barrier, would violate this assumption.\n*   **Drift current dominates**: The model assumes that the current is primarily due to the drift of charge carriers under the influence of the applied electric field. Diffusion current is considered negligible.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on these principles:\n\n*   **A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.** This is incorrect because the model assumes a single-carrier device.\n*   **B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.** This statement aligns perfectly with all the key assumptions: it specifies a trap-free material, single-carrier transport, no injection barrier (which implies an Ohmic contact), and negligible diffusion current.\n*   **C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.** This is incorrect. The SCLC regime is fundamentally a drift-dominated phenomenon; neglecting the drift current contradicts the basis of the model.\n*   **D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.** This is incorrect because a Schottky contact creates an injection barrier, which violates the assumption of an Ohmic contact required for the current to be limited by space charge rather than injection.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement describing the conditions for the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
