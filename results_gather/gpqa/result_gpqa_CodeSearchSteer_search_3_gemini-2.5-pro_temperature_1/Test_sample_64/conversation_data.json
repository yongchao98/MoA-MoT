    "### Analysis of the Reactions\n\n**Reaction 1: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol + (THF, KH, H+) ---> A**\n\nThis reaction involves a tertiary allylic alcohol treated with a strong base (potassium hydride, KH) followed by an acid workup (H+). These are classic conditions for an **anionic oxy-Cope rearrangement**. The substrate, 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol, possesses the required 3-hydroxy-1,5-diene framework necessary for this type of-sigmatropic rearrangement.\n\n1.  **Deprotonation:** The strong base KH deprotonates the hydroxyl group to form a potassium alkoxide. This is the \"anionic\" part of the reaction name and it dramatically accelerates the rearrangement.\n2.  **-Sigmatropic Rearrangement:** The alkoxide undergoes a concerted rearrangement. In this specific substrate, the rearrangement involves the breaking of a carbon-carbon bond within the cyclobutane ring, leading to a ring expansion.\n3.  **Intermediate:** The rearrangement forms an enolate intermediate.\n4.  **Protonation:** The acidic workup (H+) protonates the enolate, which then tautomerizes to the final, stable ketone product.\n\nThe starting spiro[3.5]nonane skeleton (a 4-membered ring fused to a 6-membered ring) rearranges into a bridged bicyclic system. A detailed analysis of the bond-breaking and bond-forming steps reveals that the product has a **bicyclo[5.3.1]undecane** skeleton. The ketone group forms at the carbon that was originally the alcohol (C1), and a new double bond is formed within the newly expanded ring system. A previous study on the reaction of spiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-one with vinylmagnesium bromide, which forms the same alcohol, confirms that the anionic oxy-Cope rearrangement leads to the formation of bicyclo[5.3.1]undec-1-(11)-en-4-ones in high yield.\n\nTherefore, product A is **(E)-bicyclo[5.3.1]undec-1(11)-en-4-one**.\n\n**Reaction 2: (E)-pent-2-en-1-ol + acetyl bromide (Base = LDA) ---> B**\n\nThis reaction involves an allylic alcohol, an acylating agent (acetyl bromide), and a strong, non-nucleophilic base (lithium diisopropylamide, LDA). These reagents are characteristic of the **Ireland-Claisen rearrangement**.\n\n1.  **Esterification:** The allylic alcohol, (E)-pent-2-en-1-ol, first reacts with acetyl bromide to form an allylic acetate ester, `CH3-CO-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH2CH3`.\n2.  **Enolate Formation:** The strong base, LDA, deprotonates the Î±-carbon of the acetyl group to form a lithium ester enolate.\n3.  **-Sigmatropic Rearrangement:** This enolate undergoes a-sigmatropic rearrangement. A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between the enolate carbon and the terminal carbon of the allylic double bond. The ester C-O bond is cleaved.\n4.  **Product Formation:** The direct product of this rearrangement is a lithium carboxylate. The rearrangement results in the formation of the lithium salt of 3-ethylpent-4-enoic acid.\n\nThe reaction conditions provided do not specify a final acidic workup step (unlike in Reaction 1). Therefore, the major product isolated directly from the reaction mixture is the salt.\n\nTherefore, product B is **lithium 3-ethylpent-4-enoate**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the mechanistic analysis:\n*   Product **A** is **(E)-bicyclo[5.3.1]undec-1(11)-en-4-one**.\n*   Product **B** is **lithium 3-ethylpent-4-enoate**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
