    "A dominant-negative mutation results in an altered protein that, when present alongside the wild-type protein, disrupts the function of the wild-type protein. This phenomenon is particularly common in proteins that must assemble into multi-unit complexes, such as dimers, to be functional.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the scenario:\n*   **Normal Function:** A wild-type transcription factor subunit dimerizes with another wild-type subunit. This functional dimer then enters the nucleus and activates gene transcription.\n*   **Mutation Y:** This mutation is in the dimerization domain. The key feature of a dominant-negative mutant in this context is that it can still interact with the wild-type protein. The mutant subunit (Y) binds to a wild-type subunit, forming a heterodimer (Wild-Type/Y).\n*   **The \"Poison\" Effect:** This resulting heterodimer is non-functional. By sequestering wild-type subunits into these inactive complexes, the mutant protein effectively inhibits the activity of the remaining wild-type protein. This leads to an overall loss of protein function, even though the wild-type allele is still being expressed. This mechanism is a hallmark of dominant-negative mutations in dimerizing proteins.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n*   **A) change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype:** Incorrect. A dominant-negative mutation causes a loss-of-function, not a gain-of-function.\n*   **B) loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype:** Incorrect. The phenotype is not wild-type; it's a loss-of-function. Furthermore, the issue isn't necessarily a complete loss of dimerization, but the formation of non-functional dimers that interfere with the wild-type protein's activity.\n*   **C) protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype:** While aggregation can be a consequence of some mutations, the primary mechanism for a dominant-negative effect in a dimerizing protein is the formation of a non-functional \"poison\" complex, not necessarily large-scale aggregation.\n*   **D) protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele:** Correct. The defining characteristic of this dominant-negative mutation is that it causes a \"loss-of-function of the wild-type allele\" by interfering with its protein product. The formation of improper or non-functional protein complexes can also target them for degradation by cellular machinery, making this a very likely molecular phenotype.\n\n<<<D>>>"
