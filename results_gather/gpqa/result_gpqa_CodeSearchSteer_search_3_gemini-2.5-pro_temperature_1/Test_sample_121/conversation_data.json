    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the determination of the final product's structure, followed by an analysis of its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\nAcetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2) and pyridine in the presence of acetic anhydride. This reaction is an α-bromination of the carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction. The α-carbon of acetic acid is brominated.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH)\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\nProduct 1 (bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4). This is a classic Fischer esterification reaction, where the carboxylic acid is converted to an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3)\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\nProduct 2 (ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a good nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion in an SN2 reaction.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3)\n\n**Step 4: Formation of the Final Product 4**\nProduct 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH2)5Br).\n1.  Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate, which is acidic due to the electron-withdrawing effects of both the cyano (-CN) and the ester (-COOCH2CH3) groups. This forms an enolate anion.\n    NCCH2COOEt + NaH → [NCCHCOOEt]⁻Na⁺ + H2\n2.  The resulting enolate anion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromide ion in a first alkylation step.\n    [NCCHCOOEt]⁻ + Br(CH2)5Br → NCCH( (CH2)5Br )COOEt + Br⁻\n3.  The problem states that *excess* NaH is used. This means there is enough base to deprotonate the newly formed product, which still has one acidic proton on the α-carbon.\n    NCCH( (CH2)5Br )COOEt + NaH → [NCC( (CH2)5Br )COOEt]⁻Na⁺ + H2\n4.  This new carbanion then undergoes a second, *intramolecular* SN2 reaction. The carbanion attacks the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromide ion and forming a six-membered ring (the α-carbon plus the five carbons from the pentane chain). This is a favored cyclization reaction.\n*   **Final Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4 (Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate)**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the molecule.\n*   **Structure:** The molecule consists of a cyclohexane ring substituted on one carbon (C1) with both a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3).\n*   **Symmetry:** The two substituents on C1, -CN and -COOCH2CH3, are different in terms of size and electronic properties. Because of this asymmetry, the molecule does not have a plane of symmetry. The molecule is chiral.\n*   **Counting the Signals:** In a molecule with no symmetry, all protons that are not interchangeable by bond rotation are chemically distinct and should, in principle, give separate signals.\n    *   **Ethyl Group (-COOCH2CH3):**\n        1.  The three protons of the methyl (-CH3) group are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n        2.  The two protons of the methylene (-CH2-) group are adjacent to the rest of the asymmetric molecule. This makes them diastereotopic and thus chemically non-equivalent. However, in many contexts, especially for flexible ethyl groups, they are considered to produce a single, albeit complex, signal (a quartet). Following this common convention, we count this as **1 signal**.\n    *   **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n        *   The ring contains 10 protons on five CH2 groups (at positions C2, C3, C4, C5, C6).\n        *   Due to the lack of symmetry, none of the CH2 groups are equivalent. C2 is different from C6, and C3 is different from C5.\n        *   Furthermore, within each CH2 group, the axial and equatorial protons are diastereotopic and thus non-equivalent.\n        *   Therefore, all 10 protons on the cyclohexane ring are chemically distinct. This gives **10 signals**.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\nAdding the signals from the different parts of the molecule:\nTotal Signals = 10 (from ring) + 1 (from ethyl -CH2-) + 1 (from ethyl -CH3) = **12 signals**.\n\nThus, there will be 12 distinct hydrogen signals observable in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product.\n\n<<<C>>>"
