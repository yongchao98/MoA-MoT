    "To find the energy spectrum of the quantum mechanical particle, we first need to express the given potential in Cartesian coordinates, which is often more convenient for solving the Schrödinger equation for harmonic oscillators.\n\nThe potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ) as:\n`V(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)`\n\nWe use the standard transformations from polar to Cartesian coordinates:\n*   `x = r cos(θ)`\n*   `y = r sin(θ)`\n*   `r^2 = x^2 + y^2`\n\nSubstituting these into the potential energy expression:\n`V(x, y) = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 k(r cos(θ))^2`\n`V(x, y) = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 kx^2`\n\nNow, we combine the terms with `x^2`:\n`V(x, y) = (1/2 k + 3/2 k)x^2 + 1/2 ky^2`\n`V(x, y) = (4/2 k)x^2 + 1/2 ky^2`\n`V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2`\n\nThis potential represents a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator. The potential is separable, meaning it can be written as a sum of two independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillator potentials: `V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)`, where:\n*   `V_x(x) = 1/2 (4k)x^2`\n*   `V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2`\n\nThe energy of a 2D quantum system with a separable potential is the sum of the energies of the individual one-dimensional systems. The energy spectrum for a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator with potential `V(z) = 1/2 mω^2 z^2` is given by `E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω`, where `ω = sqrt(k_eff / m)`.\n\nFor the motion in the x-direction:\n*   The effective spring constant is `k_x = 4k`.\n*   The angular frequency is `ω_x = sqrt(4k / m) = 2 * sqrt(k / m)`.\n*   The energy eigenvalues are `E_{n_x} = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * 2 * sqrt(k / m)`.\n\nFor the motion in the y-direction:\n*   The effective spring constant is `k_y = k`.\n*   The angular frequency is `ω_y = sqrt(k / m)`.\n*   The energy eigenvalues are `E_{n_y} = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k / m)`.\n\nThe total energy E is the sum of the energies for the x and y motions:\n`E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}`\n`E = 2(n_x + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k / m) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k / m)`\n\nFactoring out the common term `ħ * sqrt(k / m)`:\n`E = [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] * ħ * sqrt(k / m)`\n`E = [2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2] * ħ * sqrt(k / m)`\n`E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ħ * sqrt(k / m)`\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
