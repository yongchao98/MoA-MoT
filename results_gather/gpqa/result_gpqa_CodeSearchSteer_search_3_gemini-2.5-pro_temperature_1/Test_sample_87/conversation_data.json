    "The experiment described involves the introduction of a viral antigen (rotavirus capsid protein) via the oral route, which leads to an immune response in the Peyer's patches, a type of secondary lymphoid organ in the small intestine. The isolation of a *proliferating* cell population that shows *high variability* in the *variable heavy chain gene* points specifically to one of the following processes.\n\n*   **A) VDJ recombination:** This process creates the initial diversity of antigen receptors in developing B cells. However, it occurs in the bone marrow (a primary lymphoid organ) *before* the B cells encounter an antigen. The experiment is observing a response in a secondary lymphoid organ *after* antigen exposure.\n\n*   **B) Complement activation:** This is a component of the innate immune system, consisting of a cascade of proteins that help eliminate pathogens. It does not involve the mutation of antibody genes.\n\n*   **C) Class switching recombination (CSR):** This process changes the constant region of the antibody heavy chain (e.g., from IgM to IgA). This alters the antibody's function but crucially does *not* affect the variable region, which determines antigen specificity. Therefore, CSR is not responsible for the high variability observed in the variable gene.\n\n*   **D) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This process takes place in activated, proliferating B cells within the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs like the Peyer's patches. Following antigen stimulation, SHM introduces numerous point mutations specifically into the variable regions of the immunoglobulin genes. This creates a pool of B cells with slightly different antibodies, from which those with the highest affinity for the antigen are selected. The high variability observed in the sequenced variable heavy chain gene is the direct result of somatic hypermutation.\n\nThe key events—antigen delivery to Peyer's patches, isolation of proliferating B cells, and high genetic variability in the antigen-binding region of the antibody—are all hallmarks of somatic hypermutation occurring during an active immune response.\n\n<<<D>>>"
