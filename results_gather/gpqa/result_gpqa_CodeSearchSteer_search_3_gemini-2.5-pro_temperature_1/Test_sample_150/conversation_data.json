    "To calculate the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield a value of 0, we must follow the principles of quantum mechanics, specifically the Born rule. This involves several steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the state vector and the observable operator.**\n    *   The state of the system is given by the column matrix |ψ⟩ = `[[-1], [2], [1]]`.\n    *   The observable is represented by the matrix P:\n        ```\n        P = [[0,   1/√2, 0],\n             [1/√2, 0,   1/√2],\n             [0,   1/√2, 0]]\n        ```\n\n2.  **Find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue of interest.**\n    The measurement is expected to yield 0, so we need to find the eigenvector |v₀⟩ associated with the eigenvalue λ = 0. This is done by solving the equation P|v₀⟩ = 0|v₀⟩.\n    Let the eigenvector be |v₀⟩ = `[[x], [y], [z]]`. The equation becomes:\n    ```\n    [[0,   1/√2, 0],     [[x]]   [[0]]\n     [1/√2, 0,   1/√2], * [[y]] = [[0]]\n     [0,   1/√2, 0]]      [[z]]   [[0]]\n    ```\n    This yields the system of equations:\n    *   (1/√2)y = 0  ⇒  y = 0\n    *   (1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0  ⇒  x + z = 0  ⇒  z = -x\n    Choosing x=1, a non-normalized eigenvector is |v₀⟩ = `[[1], [0], [-1]]`.\n\n3.  **Normalize both the state vector and the eigenvector.**\n    *   **State vector |ψ⟩:**\n        The squared norm is ||ψ||² = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6.\n        The normalized state |ψ_norm⟩ is (1/√6) * `[[-1], [2], [1]]`.\n    *   **Eigenvector |v₀⟩:**\n        The squared norm is ||v₀||² = 1² + 0² + (-1)² = 2.\n        The normalized eigenvector |v₀_norm⟩ is (1/√2) * `[[1], [0], [-1]]`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the probability.**\n    According to the Born rule, the probability of measuring an eigenvalue is the square of the magnitude of the inner product (or projection) of the normalized state vector onto the normalized eigenvector corresponding to that eigenvalue. The probability P(0) is given by:\n    P(0) = |⟨v₀_norm|ψ_norm⟩|²\n\n    The inner product is:\n    ⟨v₀_norm|ψ_norm⟩ = [(1/√2), 0, -(1/√2)] * [[-1/√6], [2/√6], [1/√6]]\n    ⟨v₀_norm|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√2)(-1/√6) + (0)(2/√6) + (-1/√2)(1/√6)\n    ⟨v₀_norm|ψ_norm⟩ = -1/√12 - 1/√12 = -2/√12 = -2/(2√3) = -1/√3\n\n    The probability is the square of the magnitude of this value:\n    P(0) = |-1/√3|² = 1/3.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time t is 1/3.\n\n<<<D>>>"
