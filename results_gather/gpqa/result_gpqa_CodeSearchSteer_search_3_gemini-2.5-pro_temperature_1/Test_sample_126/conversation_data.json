    "When 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated, it undergoes a-sigmatropic rearrangement known as the Cope rearrangement. This type of reaction is common for 1,5-dienes and proceeds through a concerted mechanism involving a cyclic, chair-like transition state.\n\nThe starting material, 5-butylnona-2,6-diene, can be viewed as two allyl fragments joined by a sigma bond, which allows it to adopt the necessary conformation for the rearrangement. The reaction results in a structural isomer where the carbon skeleton has been reorganized.\n\nThe product of this specific rearrangement is 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene. This occurs through the breaking of one carbon-carbon sigma bond and the formation of a new one, along with the shifting of two pi bonds. The overall reaction is typically reversible, with the equilibrium favoring the most thermodynamically stable isomer. In this case, the product, 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene, is a stable diene.\n\nThe structure of the reactant is:\n`CH₃-CH=CH-CH₂-CH(CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃)-CH=CH-CH₂-CH₃`\n\nThe structure of the product is:\n`CH₃-CH=CH-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₂CH₃)-CH=CH-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃`\n\nThe options provided are:\nA) 5-ethylundeca-2,6-diene\nB) 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene\nC) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene\nD) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene\n\nBased on the reaction mechanism, the correct product is 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene. Options C and D are identical, indicating a likely typo in the question, but both correspond to the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
