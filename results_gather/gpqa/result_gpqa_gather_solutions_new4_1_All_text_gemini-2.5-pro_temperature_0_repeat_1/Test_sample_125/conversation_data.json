This molecule is a ketone and possesses a single chiral center at the C5 position with (S) configuration.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at the C3 position to a hydroxyl group.\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. Since the starting material already has a stereocenter at C5, the attack of the hydride ion on the planar carbonyl group can occur from two different faces, leading to the formation of two different products. These products, (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers of each other. Diastereomers have different physical properties.\n\n### Reaction II\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups.\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the two ketone groups in pentane-2,4-dione results in the formation of pentane-2,4-diol. This product has two new chiral centers at C2 and C4. Three stereoisomers are possible:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   meso-pentane-2,4-diol ((2R, 4S)- or (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol)\n*   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are a pair of enantiomers. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis of the Combined Products\n\nAfter both reactions are complete, the products are combined. In total, there are five different stereoisomers: two from Reaction I and three from Reaction II.\n\n#### Normal-Phase HPLC\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity and other physical properties. It can separate diastereomers but cannot resolve enantiomers.\n*   **From Reaction I:** The two diastereomers, (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, will be separated. This will result in **2 peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer to the enantiomeric pair of (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. Therefore, the meso compound will be separated from the enantiomers. However, the enantiomers will not be resolved and will elute together as a single peak. This will result in **2 peaks**.\n*   Assuming no accidental co-elution between the products of Reaction I and Reaction II (which is a reasonable assumption given their different structures), the total number of peaks observed in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram will be the sum of the peaks from each reaction.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### Chiral HPLC\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase that can differentiate between enantiomers in addition to separating diastereomers.\n*   **From Reaction I:** The two diastereomers will be separated. This will result in **2 peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** The chiral column will separate the meso compound from the enantiomers, and it will also resolve the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomeric pair into two separate peaks. This will result in **3 peaks**.\n*   Again, assuming no accidental co-elution, the total number of peaks will be the sum from both reactions.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 peaks**.\n\nBased on this analysis, the chemist will observe 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the products from each reaction and how they will behave in the different HPLC systems.\n\n### **Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a chiral ketone. The stereocenter is at the C5 position.\n*   **Reaction:** It is treated with Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. The ketone at the C3 position is reduced to a hydroxyl group.\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the carbonyl group creates a new stereocenter at C3. Since the starting material is enantiomerically pure (only the S-isomer at C5), the hydride can attack the planar carbonyl from two different faces. This results in the formation of two products that are diastereomers of each other: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Separation:** Diastereomers have different physical and chemical properties. Therefore, they can be separated by both normal-phase and chiral HPLC. This reaction will produce **two peaks** in both chromatograms.\n\n### **Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reaction:** It is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), a reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. Both ketone groups at C2 and C4 are reduced to hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Products:** The reduction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. This leads to the formation of three stereoisomers:\n    *   A pair of enantiomers: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   A meso compound: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, which is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\n### **Combined Chromatographic Analysis**\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of five different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral and separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n*   It can separate diastereomers and constitutional isomers because they have different physical properties.\n*   It cannot separate enantiomers, which have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n*   Therefore, the analysis will show:\n    *   **Peak 1:** (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   **Peak 2:** (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (diastereomer of Peak 1)\n    *   **Peak 3:** A single peak containing both (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (enantiomers).\n    *   **Peak 4:** (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso compound, diastereomer of the compounds in Peak 3).\n*   This results in a total of **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that can distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   It can separate all five stereoisomers in the mixture, as they will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n*   Therefore, the analysis will show:\n    *   **Peak 1:** (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   **Peak 2:** (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   **Peak 3:** (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   **Peak 4:** (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   **Peak 5:** (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n*   This results in a total of **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\nBased on this analysis, the chemist will observe 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of peaks in each chromatogram.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule with one stereocenter at the C5 position.\n    *   Structure: `CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3`\n    *   The stereocenter at C5 has the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The starting material is treated with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. LAH will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the Product:** The reduction of the ketone at C3 creates a new stereocenter. The carbonyl carbon is prochiral, and the hydride nucleophile can attack from either face. The original stereocenter at C5 is not affected by the reaction.\n    *   Attack from one face will yield (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n    *   Attack from the other face will yield (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Relationship between Products:** The two products, (3R, 5S) and (3S, 5S), have the same connectivity but differ in the configuration at one stereocenter (C3) while having the same configuration at another (C5). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral molecule.\n    *   Structure: `CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3`\n*   **Reaction:** The starting material is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH4), a reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. The excess NaBH4 will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the Product:** The product, pentane-2,4-diol, has two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n    *   Structure: `CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3`\n    *   Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, the overall mixture of products must be achiral.\n    *   The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   The molecule is symmetric. Let's analyze the isomers:\n        *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since they are formed from an achiral starting material, they will be produced in equal amounts, forming a racemic mixture.\n        *   (2R, 4S) is identical to (2S, 4R). This isomer has an internal plane of symmetry in one of its conformations and is an achiral **meso compound**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomers are formed: a racemic pair of enantiomers ((±)-pentane-2,4-diol) and a meso compound (meso-pentane-2,4-diol). The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the combined mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC is an **achiral** separation technique. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore **cannot be separated**. They will elute together as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** and **constitutional isomers** have different physical properties and **can be separated**.\n*   Let's count the separable species in the combined mixture:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n    3.  The racemic mixture of (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n    4.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n*   Species 1 and 2 are diastereomers, so they will separate into **two peaks**.\n*   Species 3 (the enantiomeric pair) will elute as **one peak**.\n*   Species 4 (the meso compound) is a diastereomer of the compounds in species 3, so it will be separated from them, giving **one peak**.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C7 ethers/alcohols) are constitutional isomers of the products from Reaction II (C5 diols), so they are structurally very different and will have different retention times.\n*   Total peaks = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the combined mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   Chiral HPLC uses a **chiral** stationary phase. This chiral environment allows for the separation of **enantiomers**, in addition to diastereomers and constitutional isomers.\n*   Essentially, a chiral column can separate all stereoisomers that are not identical.\n*   Let's count the distinct stereoisomers in the mixture:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   All five of these are distinct chemical compounds. The chiral column can differentiate between the enantiomers (3 and 4) as well as all the diastereomeric and constitutional relationships.\n*   Therefore, we expect to see a separate peak for each of the five stereoisomers.\n*   Total peaks = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Summary**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is a six-carbon chain with a ketone at position 3 and a methoxy group (-OCH3) at position 5.\n    *   The carbon at position 5 is a chiral center with an (S) configuration. This means the starting material is enantiomerically pure.\n    *   Structure: `CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(S)(OCH3)-CH3`\n*   **Reagents:** The reactant is treated with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH, LiAlH4), followed by an acidic workup (H3O+).\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. The reagent itself is achiral.\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the ketone at C3 creates a new chiral center. The hydride ion (H-) can attack the planar carbonyl group from either the top face or the bottom face.\n    *   This non-selective attack on the C3 carbonyl will produce both (R) and (S) configurations at the new C3 chiral center.\n    *   The original chiral center at C5 remains unchanged (it keeps its S configuration).\n    *   Therefore, two products are formed:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship between products:** These two products have the same connectivity but different stereochemistry at one of their two chiral centers. This makes them **diastereomers**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** The starting material is pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone).\n    *   Structure: `CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3`\n    *   This molecule is **achiral** as it possesses a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reagents:** The reactant is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH4), followed by an acidic workup (H3O+).\n    *   NaBH4 is also a reducing agent for ketones. \"Excess\" indicates that both ketone groups will be reduced to secondary alcohols. The reagent is achiral.\n*   **Products:** The reduction of both ketones at C2 and C4 creates two new chiral centers. The product is pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   Let's analyze these stereoisomers:\n        *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol are **enantiomers** of each other. Since the reaction starts with an achiral reactant and uses an achiral reagent, this pair of enantiomers will be produced in a 1:1 ratio, forming a **racemic mixture**.\n        *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol has an internal plane of symmetry. This makes it a **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration represents the same meso compound.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction II produces three distinct stereoisomers: the (R,R) enantiomer, the (S,S) enantiomer, and the meso compound.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of five different compounds:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n\n**Analysis with Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column):**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   The two products from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and **will be separated**. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   The three products from Reaction II are a pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) and a meso compound.\n    *   The enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and **will not be separated**, eluting together as a single peak.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It has different physical properties and **will be separated** from the enantiomeric pair's peak.\n    *   This gives **2 peaks** from the products of Reaction II.\n*   The products of Reaction I (C7H16O2) and Reaction II (C5H12O2) are structurally very different (different molecular formulas and weights) and will be easily separated from each other.\n*   Total peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Analysis with Chiral HPLC (Chiral Stationary Phase):**\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation. It can also separate diastereomers and constitutional isomers.\n*   All five stereoisomers in the mixture are chemically distinct.\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (diastereomer of 1, will be separated)\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (enantiomer of 3, will be separated by the chiral column)\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (diastereomer of 3 & 4, will be separated)\n*   Since all five compounds are unique stereoisomers, a chiral column is capable of resolving all of them.\n*   Total peaks in chiral HPLC = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe analysis predicts **5 peaks in chiral HPLC** and **4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC**. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   It has one chiral center at carbon 5 (C5), with an (S) configuration. This chiral center is not affected by the reaction.\n*   **Reagents:** LAH (Lithium aluminum hydride) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Reaction:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol. This reduction creates a new chiral center at C3.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The hydride ion (H⁻) can attack the planar carbonyl group from either the front face or the back face. This leads to the formation of two possible configurations (R or S) at the new chiral center (C3).\n*   **Products of Reaction I:**\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** Since one chiral center is the same ((S) at C5) and the other is different ((R) vs (S) at C3), these two products are **diastereomers**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral (it has a plane of symmetry).\n*   **Reagents:** Excess NaBH₄ (Sodium borohydride) followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction:** NaBH₄ reduces both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, forming pentane-2,4-diol. The reduction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, all possible stereoisomers will be formed. The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   **(2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S):** These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are **enantiomers**. They will be formed in a 1:1 ratio, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C3. A chiral molecule with an internal plane of symmetry is called a **meso compound**.\n    *   **(2S, 4R):** This is identical to the (2R, 4S) meso compound (rotating the molecule 180° in the plane of the paper shows they are the same).\n*   **Products of Reaction II:**\n    1.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    2.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    3.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso compound)\n*   **Relationship:** The products are a pair of enantiomers and their diastereomer (the meso compound). In total, there are three distinct stereoisomers.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains all five products from both reactions:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n\n**Analysis on Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column):**\n\n*   An achiral column separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n*   It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers.\n*   It **cannot** separate enantiomers, which have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Enantiomers will elute together as a single peak.\n*   Let's count the peaks:\n    *   The products from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. They have different properties and will separate. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction II consist of a meso compound and a racemic pair of enantiomers. The meso compound ((2R, 4S)-diol) is a diastereomer of the enantiomers ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-diols). Therefore, the meso compound will separate from the enantiomeric pair. The enantiomers themselves will not separate and will elute as one peak. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are constitutional isomers with different molecular formulas and structures. They will have significantly different retention times and will not co-elute.\n    *   Total peaks = (Peaks from Rxn I) + (Peaks from Rxn II) = 2 + 2 = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Analysis on Chiral HPLC:**\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with different stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n*   It can separate all five distinct stereoisomers present in the mixture.\n*   Let's count the peaks:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 1)\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 2)\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 3)\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 4)\n    5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso) (Peak 5)\n*   Total peaks = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe analysis shows there will be **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram and **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral ketone with one stereocenter at the C5 position, with an (S) configuration.\n    *   Structure: CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol. This reaction is followed by an acidic workup to protonate the resulting alkoxide.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. Since the starting material already has a stereocenter at C5, the attack of the hydride ion (H-) on the two faces of the carbonyl group is not equally probable. This leads to the formation of two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Relationship:** These two products have the same connectivity but are not mirror images of each other (the mirror image of (3R, 5S) is (3S, 5R)). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral diketone.\n    *   Structure: CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4) reduces both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Product:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   Structure: CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The product has two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. Since the starting material and reagent are achiral, we must consider all possible stereoisomers. The molecule is symmetric around the C3 carbon.\n    1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These two are non-superimposable mirror images, making them a pair of **enantiomers**. They will be formed in equal amounts, creating a racemic mixture.\n    2.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This stereoisomer has a plane of symmetry passing through the C3 atom and is therefore an achiral **meso compound**. (Note: (2S, 4R) is the same meso compound).\n*   **Relationship:** The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the enantiomeric pair.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomeric products are formed: a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the combined product mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC uses an achiral stationary phase and separates compounds based on differences in polarity. It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis of the mixture:**\n    *   **From Reaction I:** The two products are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, including polarity, so they will have different retention times and will be separated into **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** The three products consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The two enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) have identical polarities and will not be separated, eluting together as **1 peak**. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers, has a different polarity, and will be separated, giving a second, distinct **1 peak**. Thus, the products of Reaction II will show **2 peaks**.\n    *   **Combined:** The products from Reaction I (C7 ether-alcohols) are structurally distinct from the products of Reaction II (C5 diols) and will have different polarities. Therefore, it is assumed that none of the peaks from Reaction I will accidentally overlap with peaks from Reaction II.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 peaks (from Reaction I) + 2 peaks (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the combined product mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. This allows for the separation of all different stereoisomers, including **both diastereomers and enantiomers**.\n*   **Analysis of the mixture:**\n    *   **From Reaction I:** The two diastereomeric products will be separated, resulting in **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** The three stereoisomeric products will all be separated from each other. The two enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase and will be resolved into **2 separate peaks**. The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also have a unique retention time, giving **1 peak**. Thus, the products of Reaction II will show **3 peaks**.\n    *   **Combined:** Again, assuming no accidental overlap between the products of the two reactions.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** 2 peaks (from Reaction I) + 3 peaks (from Reaction II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts:\n*   **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n*   **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(OCH₃)-CH₃.\n    *   It has one stereocenter at carbon C5, with the (S) configuration. This stereocenter is not affected by the reaction.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Reaction:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Product Stereochemistry:** The carbonyl carbon at C3 is prochiral. The reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3. The hydride ion (H⁻) can attack the planar carbonyl group from either the front face or the back face. This results in the formation of two possible configurations at C3: (R) and (S).\n*   **Products of Reaction I:** Since the original stereocenter at C5 remains (S), the reaction produces a mixture of two diastereomers:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    These two compounds are diastereomers because they have one stereocenter that is the same (5S) and one that is different (3R vs. 3S).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral; it has a plane of symmetry passing through the central CH₂ group.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction:** NaBH₄ reduces both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Product Stereochemistry:** The reduction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** are enantiomers of each other. They will be formed as a racemic mixture (equal amounts).\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** has a plane of symmetry (it can be drawn in a conformation where the top half is a mirror image of the bottom half). Therefore, it is a **meso compound**. A meso compound is achiral and superimposable on its mirror image. This means (2R, 4S) is identical to (2S, 4R).\n*   **Products of Reaction II:** The reaction produces three distinct stereoisomers:\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol ((2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol)\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC is an achiral technique. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated. They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated.\n*   **Applying to the mixture:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. They have different shapes and polarities and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) and a meso compound.\n        *   The enantiomers (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) will co-elute, giving **one peak**.\n        *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It has different physical properties and will be separated, giving a **second peak**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are structurally very different (different molecular weight, different functional groups - ether vs. diol). They will have significantly different polarities and will be easily separated from each other.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** The two peaks from Reaction I products plus the two peaks from Reaction II products result in a total of **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase (CSP). The CSP interacts differently with different stereoisomers, allowing for the separation of both enantiomers and diastereomers.\n*   **Applying to the mixture:** The combined mixture contains a total of five unique stereoisomers:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** Since a chiral column can resolve all distinct stereoisomers, and there are five stereoisomers in the mixture, the chromatogram will show **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **Goal:** Determine the number of peaks in two different HPLC analyses (normal-phase and chiral) of a combined product mixture.\n    *   **Source of products:** Two separate chemical reactions.\n    *   **Reaction I:** Reduction of a chiral ketone, (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, with LAH.\n    *   **Reaction II:** Reduction of an achiral diketone, pentane-2,4-dione, with NaBH4.\n    *   **Analysis I:** Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds by polarity. It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but *not* enantiomers.\n    *   **Analysis II:** Chiral HPLC separates compounds based on their interaction with a chiral stationary phase. It can separate constitutional isomers, diastereomers, *and* enantiomers.\n\n2.  **Plan the Analysis:**\n    *   **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I.** Determine the structure and stereochemistry of the product(s).\n    *   **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II.** Determine the structure and stereochemistry of the product(s).\n    *   **Step 3: Combine the products.** List all unique molecules formed.\n    *   **Step 4: Predict the number of peaks for Normal-Phase HPLC.** Group enantiomers together, but separate diastereomers and constitutional isomers.\n    *   **Step 5: Predict the number of peaks for Chiral HPLC.** Count every unique stereoisomer.\n    *   **Step 6: Match the results to the given options.**\n\n3.  **Execute the Plan:**\n\n    *   **Action 1: Analyze Reaction I.**\n        *   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a ketone with one existing stereocenter at carbon 5.\n        *   **Reagent:** LAH (Lithium aluminum hydride) is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone (C=O) at carbon 3 to an alcohol (CH-OH).\n        *   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The reduction of the planar carbonyl group creates a *new* stereocenter at carbon 3. The original stereocenter at carbon 5 is unaffected. The hydride can attack from two different faces, creating both (R) and (S) configurations at the new center.\n        *   **Products of Reaction I:**\n            *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n            *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        *   **Relationship:** These two products have the same connectivity but different stereochemistry at one center (C3) while the other is the same (C5). They are **diastereomers**.\n        *   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Produces 2 diastereomeric compounds.\n\n    *   **Action 2: Analyze Reaction II.**\n        *   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is a symmetric, achiral diketone.\n        *   **Reagent:** Excess NaBH4 will reduce both ketone groups to alcohols, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n        *   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The reaction creates two new stereocenters at carbons 2 and 4. We must consider all possible combinations: (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n        *   **Products of Reaction II:**\n            *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. These are non-superimposable mirror images, so they are an **enantiomeric pair**.\n            *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry between C2 and C4. It is a **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration is the same molecule, just flipped over.\n        *   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Produces 3 stereoisomers in total: one pair of enantiomers and one meso compound.\n\n    *   **Action 3: Predict Normal-Phase HPLC Peaks.**\n        *   Normal-phase HPLC separates based on polarity. Enantiomers have identical polarities and co-elute (give one peak). Diastereomers and constitutional isomers have different polarities and separate.\n        *   **From Reaction I:** The two products are diastereomers. They will separate. -> **2 peaks**.\n        *   **From Reaction II:** The enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) will co-elute. -> **1 peak**. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will elute separately. -> **1 peak**.\n        *   **Total Normal-Phase Peaks:** The products from Reaction I are constitutionally different from the products of Reaction II, so they will all be distinct. Total peaks = 2 (from I) + 1 (enantiomers from II) + 1 (meso from II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n    *   **Action 4: Predict Chiral HPLC Peaks.**\n        *   Chiral HPLC separates all stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n        *   **From Reaction I:** The two diastereomers will separate. -> **2 peaks**.\n        *   **From Reaction II:** The enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) will be resolved into two separate peaks. -> **2 peaks**. The meso compound is achiral but is a distinct molecule from the others, so it will give its own peak. -> **1 peak**.\n        *   **Total Chiral HPLC Peaks:** Total peaks = 2 (from I) + 2 (enantiomers from II) + 1 (meso from II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n    *   **Action 5: Final Conclusion.**\n        *   The analysis predicts 5 peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.\n        *   This corresponds to option D.\n\nThe plan is complete and the logic is sound. I am confident in the result.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nAn analysis of the reactions and the resulting products is required to determine the number of peaks in the chromatograms.\n\n### **Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a chiral ketone. The stereocenter is at the C5 position.\n*   **Reaction:** It is treated with lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. LAH reduces the ketone at C3 to a hydroxyl group.\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. Since the starting material is chiral and the reducing agent is achiral, the hydride can attack the planar carbonyl from either face. This results in the formation of two products that are diastereomers of each other:\n    *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n\nThese two compounds are diastereomers because one stereocenter is the same (S at C5) while the other is different (R or S at C3).\n\n### **Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reaction:** It is treated with excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4), which reduces both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups, followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Products:** The reduction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. This leads to the formation of three stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol:\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol:** This is a pair of enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images).\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol:** This is a meso compound. It is achiral because it has a plane of symmetry, and it is a diastereomer of the other two products.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of five different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n\n### **Chromatographic Separation**\n\n**Normal-Phase HPLC:**\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated by normal-phase HPLC.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated by a normal-phase (achiral) column.\n\nBased on this, we can predict the number of peaks:\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, will separate into **two peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will co-elute as a **single peak**.\n*   The meso compound, (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have a different retention time, resulting in a **separate peak**.\n*   The products of Reaction I (methoxy-alcohols) and Reaction II (diols) are structurally distinct molecules with different polarities and will be separated from each other.\n\nTherefore, the total number of peaks in the normal-phase HPLC will be 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Chiral HPLC:**\nChiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase that can differentiate between stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n*   It can separate diastereomers.\n*   It can separate enantiomers.\n\nTherefore, all five unique stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 1)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 2)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 3)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 4)\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 5)\n\nThis results in a total of **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe chemist will observe 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms:\n\n### Reaction I\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a ketone with a single chiral center at the C5 position.\n*   **Reaction:** It is treated with lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, which reduces the ketone at the C3 position to a hydroxyl group. This reduction creates a new chiral center at C3.\n*   **Products:** The attack of the hydride on the planar carbonyl group can occur from two different faces. Since the starting material is already chiral, this leads to the formation of two different products that are diastereomers of each other: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n\n### Reaction II\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reaction:** It is treated with sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), which reduces both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Products:** The reduction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4. This results in the formation of three stereoisomers:\n    *   A pair of enantiomers: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   A meso compound: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, which is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\n### Combined Products\n\nAfter both reactions are complete, the product mixture contains a total of five distinct compounds:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis\n\n**Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column):**\nThis technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore will not be separated.\n*   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n\nLet's analyze the mixture:\n*   The two products from Reaction I, (3S, 5S)- and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will elute together as a **single peak**.\n*   The meso compound, (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will be separated, resulting in another **single peak**.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C7 alcohols) and Reaction II (C5 diols) are structurally different and will have different retention times.\n\nTherefore, the total number of peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram will be 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Chiral HPLC (Chiral Stationary Phase):**\nThis technique is designed to separate chiral molecules, including enantiomers.\n*   The chiral stationary phase interacts differently with each enantiomer, allowing for their separation.\n\nLet's analyze the five compounds in the mixture:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (chiral)\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (chiral)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (chiral)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (chiral)\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (achiral, meso)\n\n*   The chiral column will separate the two diastereomers from Reaction I.\n*   It will also separate the enantiomeric pair from Reaction II.\n*   The achiral meso compound will elute as a single peak, separated from the other compounds.\n\nAssuming the column can resolve all distinct species, each of the five compounds will produce a separate peak. Thus, the total number of peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram will be **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe chemist will observe 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatographic separation:\n\n### **Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a ketone with a pre-existing chiral center at the C5 position, with the (S) configuration.\n2.  **Reaction:** The ketone at the C3 position is reduced to a secondary alcohol by Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent. This reduction creates a new chiral center at C3.\n3.  **Products:** Since the hydride from the achiral LAH can attack the planar carbonyl group from either the top or bottom face, two different stereoisomers are formed. The original chiral center at C5 remains unchanged (S configuration). The new chiral center at C3 can be either (R) or (S). This results in the formation of two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n4.  **Stereochemical Relationship:** These two products are diastereomers because they have multiple chiral centers and are not mirror images of each other.\n\n### **Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral diketone.\n2.  **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols by excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄). This creates two new chiral centers at the C2 and C4 positions.\n3.  **Products:** The reduction of an achiral starting material with an achiral reagent produces all possible stereoisomers. The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), and (2R, 4S).\n4.  **Stereochemical Relationship:**\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol are enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images).\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol is a meso compound. It has chiral centers, but it is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry. The (2S, 4R) configuration is identical to the (2R, 4S) one.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction II produces a total of three distinct stereoisomers.\n\n### **Chromatographic Analysis of the Combined Products**\n\nThe final mixture contains five different compounds: the two diastereomers from Reaction I and the three stereoisomers (the enantiomeric pair and the meso compound) from Reaction II.\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\nA normal-phase HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   **From Reaction I:** The two products, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** The enantiomers, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound, (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, is a diastereomer of the enantiomers and has different physical properties, so it will be separated as a distinct peak. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   **Total Peaks:** Assuming the products of Reaction I and Reaction II are all resolved from each other, the total number of peaks will be 2 + 2 = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC**\n\nA chiral HPLC column has a stationary phase that is itself chiral, allowing it to interact differently with enantiomers and thus separate them.\n*   **From Reaction I:** The two diastereomers will be separated, giving **2 peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** The chiral column will separate the (2R, 4R) enantiomer from the (2S, 4S) enantiomer. The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also be separated. This results in **3 peaks**.\n*   **Total Peaks:** The total number of peaks observed will be the sum of all separable compounds, which is 2 + 3 = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe chemist will observe 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n1.  **Stereochemistry of Starting Materials:** Identify if the starting materials are chiral or achiral.\n2.  **Nature of the Reaction:** Understand how the reagents (LAH, NaBH4) affect the functional groups (ketones).\n3.  **Creation of New Stereocenters:** Determine if the reactions create new chiral centers.\n4.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** Predict the stereoisomers formed (enantiomers, diastereomers, meso compounds) and their relationships.\n5.  **Principles of HPLC Separation:**\n    *   **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral):** Separates compounds based on polarity. It can separate diastereomers but cannot separate enantiomers.\n    *   **Chiral HPLC:** Uses a chiral stationary phase to separate enantiomers. It can also separate diastereomers.\n6.  **Combined Mixture:** The final analysis is on the combined products of both reactions. We must assume that structurally distinct molecules (e.g., products from Reaction I vs. Reaction II) and diastereomers will not accidentally have the same retention time.\n\n---\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This molecule has one stereocenter at carbon 5 (C5) and is therefore chiral.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol by Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH). This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** The original stereocenter at C5 is not affected by the reaction. The new stereocenter at C3 can be either (R) or (S). This results in the formation of two products:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products have the same molecular formula but different spatial arrangements. One stereocenter is the same ((S) at C5) while the other is different ((R) vs. (S) at C3). This makes them **diastereomers**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is symmetric and achiral.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups at C2 and C4 are reduced to secondary alcohols by excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH4). This creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol. We must consider all possible stereoisomers. The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images. They are a pair of **enantiomers**.\n    *   (2R, 4S) has an internal plane of symmetry and is superimposable on its mirror image, (2S, 4R). This is a single, achiral **meso compound**.\n*   **Relationship:** The reaction starts with an achiral molecule and produces all possible stereoisomers. Therefore, the products are a mixture of three compounds:\n    1.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    2.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    3.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso compound)\n    The two enantiomers will be formed in equal amounts, creating a racemic mixture. The meso compound is a diastereomer of each of the enantiomers.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture on Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates diastereomers but not enantiomers.\n*   **From Reaction I:** We have two diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** We have a meso compound and a racemic pair of enantiomers.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers, so it will be separated from them, giving **1 peak**.\n    *   The two enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) are inseparable on an achiral column and will elute together as **1 peak**.\n    *   Thus, the products from Reaction II give a total of **2 peaks**.\n*   **Total Peaks:** The products from Reaction I (C7 compounds) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (C5 compounds) and will elute at different times.\n    *   Total Peaks = (Peaks from Rxn I) + (Peaks from Rxn II) = 2 + 2 = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture on Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   Chiral HPLC separates both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n*   **From Reaction I:** We have two diastereomers. They will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** We have a meso compound and a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   The meso compound is achiral and will give **1 peak**.\n    *   The two enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) will be separated by the chiral column, giving **2 peaks**.\n    *   Thus, the products from Reaction II give a total of **3 peaks**.\n*   **Total Peaks:** Again, assuming no accidental overlap between the two sets of products.\n    *   Total Peaks = (Peaks from Rxn I) + (Peaks from Rxn II) = 2 + 3 = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Number of peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 4\n*   Number of peaks in chiral HPLC = 5\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a detailed analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatographic separations:\n\n### **Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a chiral ketone. The stereocenter at carbon 5 has the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** It is treated with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. LAH will reduce the ketone at carbon 3 to a hydroxyl group.\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. Since the starting material is chiral and the reducing agent (LAH) is achiral, the hydride can attack the planar carbonyl group from either face. This results in the formation of two products with different configurations (R or S) at the newly formed chiral center (C3).\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:** These two products are diastereomers because they have one stereocenter that is the same (5S) and one that is different (3R vs. 3S).\n\n### **Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reaction:** It is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH4), a reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. NaBH4 will reduce both ketone groups at carbons 2 and 4 to hydroxyl groups.\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the two ketones creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. The possible stereoisomers are:\n    *   Product 3: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Product 4: (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Product 5: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:**\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, making them a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol has an internal plane of symmetry, which makes it a meso compound. It is achiral.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n    *   Therefore, this reaction produces three distinct stereoisomers.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of five different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n\n### **Chromatographic Separation**\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\nA normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, primarily polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers**, having identical physical properties in an achiral environment, will not be separated and will elute as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated.\n*   The two products from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers and will therefore produce **two separate peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will co-elute as **one peak**.\n*   The meso compound, (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have a different polarity, resulting in a **separate, second peak** for the products of Reaction II.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C7 alcohols with an ether group) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (C5 diols) and will have different retention times.\n*   Therefore, the total number of peaks observed will be 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC**\nAn HPLC with a chiral stationary phase is designed to separate stereoisomers, including enantiomers. It can distinguish between all five unique stereoisomers present in the mixture.\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol will give **one peak**.\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol will give a **second peak**.\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol will give a **third peak**.\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol will give a **fourth peak**.\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (the meso compound) is also a unique stereoisomer and will give a **fifth peak**.\n*   Therefore, the total number of peaks observed in the chiral HPLC chromatogram will be **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nBased on the analysis:\n\n*   **Reaction I** produces two diastereomers: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Reaction II** produces three stereoisomers: an enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) and a meso compound (meso-pentane-2,4-diol).\n*   In total, there are **5 unique stereoisomers** in the final mixture.\n\n**HPLC Analysis:**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC** can separate all 5 unique stereoisomers, resulting in **5 peaks**.\n*   **Normal-phase (achiral) HPLC** separates diastereomers but not enantiomers.\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I give 2 peaks.\n    *   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair gives 1 peak, and the meso compound gives a separate peak (2 peaks total).\n    *   The products from the two reactions are structurally different and will not co-elute.\n    *   Total peaks = 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\nThe final result is 5 peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\n### Analysis of the Reactions and Products\n\n**Reaction I:**\nThe starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, a chiral ketone. It is treated with lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. The reduction of the ketone at the C3 position creates a new stereocenter. Since there is a pre-existing stereocenter at C5, the hydride attack on the carbonyl group is not equally probable from both faces. This results in the formation of two diastereomers: (3S,5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R,5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n\n**Reaction II:**\nThe starting material is pentane-2,4-dione, an achiral diketone. It is treated with excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4), which reduces both ketone groups to alcohols. This reaction creates two new stereocenters at positions C2 and C4. The possible products are (2R,4R)-pentane-2,4-diol, (2S,4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, and (2R,4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. The (2R,4R) and (2S,4S) isomers are a pair of enantiomers. The (2R,4S) isomer is a meso compound, as it has an internal plane of symmetry and is achiral. Therefore, Reaction II produces a total of three stereoisomers.\n\n### Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe final mixture that is analyzed contains a total of five different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3S,5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3R,5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R,4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S,4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2R,4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso compound)\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis\n\n**Normal-Phase HPLC:**\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated.\n*   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n\nIn the product mixture:\n*   The two products from Reaction I, (3S,5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R,5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair, (2R,4R)- and (2S,4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will co-elute as a **single peak**.\n*   The meso compound, (2R,4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, is a diastereomer to the other two products of Reaction II and will be separated, giving a **second peak** from this reaction's products.\n*   The products from Reaction I (methoxyhexanols) are structurally distinct from the products of Reaction II (pentanediols) and will have different retention times.\n\nTherefore, the total number of peaks observed in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram will be 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Chiral HPLC:**\nChiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with each stereoisomer, allowing for the separation of enantiomers as well as diastereomers.\n*   The column will separate the two diastereomers from Reaction I.\n*   The column will separate the two enantiomers and the meso compound from Reaction II.\n\nSince there are five distinct stereoisomers in the mixture, and a chiral column can resolve all of them, the chemist will observe **5 peaks**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis leads to the following conclusion:\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nAnswering the user's question.\n### Analysis of the Reactions and Products\n\n**Reaction I:**\nThe starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral ketone with a stereocenter at the C5 position. It is treated with Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, which reduces the ketone at C3 to an alcohol. This reduction creates a new stereocenter at the C3 position. Since the starting material is chiral and the reducing agent is achiral, the hydride can attack the planar carbonyl group from either face, resulting in the formation of two products: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two products are diastereomers because they have one stereocenter in common (C5) and one that is different (C3).\n\n*   **Products of Reaction I:** A mixture of two diastereomers.\n\n**Reaction II:**\nThe starting material is pentane-2,4-dione, an achiral diketone. It is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH4), which reduces both ketone groups to alcohols, forming pentane-2,4-diol. The reduction of the carbonyls at C2 and C4 creates two new stereocenters. The possible stereoisomers are:\n1.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n2.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n3.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n\nThe (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are a pair of enantiomers. The (2R, 4S) isomer has an internal plane of symmetry and is therefore an achiral meso compound. The reduction of an achiral starting material with an achiral reagent produces all possible stereoisomers, so the product is a mixture of the racemic pair and the meso compound.\n\n*   **Products of Reaction II:** A mixture of three stereoisomers (one pair of enantiomers and one meso compound).\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis\n\nThe products from both reactions are combined, resulting in a total of five different stereoisomers to be analyzed.\n\n**Normal-Phase HPLC:**\nThis technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, primarily polarity. The stationary phase is achiral (e.g., silica).\n*   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n*   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated; they will elute together as a single peak.\n\nApplying this to the product mixture:\n1.  The two diastereomers from Reaction I ((3S, 5S)- and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol) will have different polarities and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n2.  From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) will co-elute as **one peak**.\n3.  The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have a different polarity, eluting as a separate, **second peak** from the Reaction II products.\n4.  The products of Reaction I (C7 ether-alcohols) and Reaction II (C5 diols) are structurally very different and will have distinct polarities, ensuring they do not accidentally elute at the same time.\n\nTherefore, the total number of peaks in the normal-phase HPLC is 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Chiral HPLC:**\nThis technique uses a chiral stationary phase (CSP) which allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n*   It can separate all stereoisomers, including both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n\nApplying this to the product mixture:\n1.  The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated, giving **two peaks**.\n2.  The enantiomeric pair from Reaction II will be resolved by the chiral column into **two separate peaks**.\n3.  The meso compound from Reaction II is achiral and will produce a single, distinct **one peak**.\n\nTherefore, the total number of peaks in the chiral HPLC is 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis predicts 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

This molecule is a ketone and possesses a single chiral center at the C5 position with (S) configuration.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at the C3 position to a hydroxyl group.\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. Since the starting material already has a stereocenter at C5, the attack of the hydride ion on the planar carbonyl group can occur from two different faces, leading to the formation of two different products. These products, (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers of each other. Diastereomers have different physical properties.\n\n### Reaction II\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups.\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the two ketone groups in pentane-2,4-dione results in the formation of pentane-2,4-diol. This product has two new chiral centers at C2 and C4. Three stereoisomers are possible:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   meso-pentane-2,4-diol ((2R, 4S)- or (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol)\n*   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are a pair of enantiomers. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis of the Combined Products\n\nAfter both reactions are complete, the products are combined. In total, there are five different stereoisomers: two from Reaction I and three from Reaction II.\n\n#### Normal-Phase HPLC\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity and other physical properties. It can separate diastereomers but cannot resolve enantiomers.\n*   **From Reaction I:** The two diastereomers, (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, will be separated. This will result in **2 peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer to the enantiomeric pair of (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. Therefore, the meso compound will be separated from the enantiomers. However, the enantiomers will not be resolved and will elute together as a single peak. This will result in **2 peaks**.\n*   Assuming no accidental co-elution between the products of Reaction I and Reaction II (which is a reasonable assumption given their different structures), the total number of peaks observed in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram will be the sum of the peaks from each reaction.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### Chiral HPLC\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase that can differentiate between enantiomers in addition to separating diastereomers.\n*   **From Reaction I:** The two diastereomers will be separated. This will result in **2 peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** The chiral column will separate the meso compound from the enantiomers, and it will also resolve the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomeric pair into two separate peaks. This will result in **3 peaks**.\n*   Again, assuming no accidental co-elution, the total number of peaks will be the sum from both reactions.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 peaks**.\n\nBased on this analysis, the chemist will observe 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the products from each reaction and how they will behave in the different HPLC systems.\n\n### **Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a chiral ketone. The stereocenter is at the C5 position.\n*   **Reaction:** It is treated with Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. The ketone at the C3 position is reduced to a hydroxyl group.\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the carbonyl group creates a new stereocenter at C3. Since the starting material is enantiomerically pure (only the S-isomer at C5), the hydride can attack the planar carbonyl from two different faces. This results in the formation of two products that are diastereomers of each other: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Separation:** Diastereomers have different physical and chemical properties. Therefore, they can be separated by both normal-phase and chiral HPLC. This reaction will produce **two peaks** in both chromatograms.\n\n### **Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reaction:** It is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), a reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. Both ketone groups at C2 and C4 are reduced to hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Products:** The reduction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. This leads to the formation of three stereoisomers:\n    *   A pair of enantiomers: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   A meso compound: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, which is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\n### **Combined Chromatographic Analysis**\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of five different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral and separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n*   It can separate diastereomers and constitutional isomers because they have different physical properties.\n*   It cannot separate enantiomers, which have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n*   Therefore, the analysis will show:\n    *   **Peak 1:** (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   **Peak 2:** (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (diastereomer of Peak 1)\n    *   **Peak 3:** A single peak containing both (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (enantiomers).\n    *   **Peak 4:** (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso compound, diastereomer of the compounds in Peak 3).\n*   This results in a total of **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that can distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   It can separate all five stereoisomers in the mixture, as they will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n*   Therefore, the analysis will show:\n    *   **Peak 1:** (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   **Peak 2:** (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   **Peak 3:** (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   **Peak 4:** (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   **Peak 5:** (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n*   This results in a total of **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\nBased on this analysis, the chemist will observe 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of peaks in each chromatogram.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule with one stereocenter at the C5 position.\n    *   Structure: `CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3`\n    *   The stereocenter at C5 has the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The starting material is treated with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. LAH will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the Product:** The reduction of the ketone at C3 creates a new stereocenter. The carbonyl carbon is prochiral, and the hydride nucleophile can attack from either face. The original stereocenter at C5 is not affected by the reaction.\n    *   Attack from one face will yield (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n    *   Attack from the other face will yield (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Relationship between Products:** The two products, (3R, 5S) and (3S, 5S), have the same connectivity but differ in the configuration at one stereocenter (C3) while having the same configuration at another (C5). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral molecule.\n    *   Structure: `CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3`\n*   **Reaction:** The starting material is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH4), a reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. The excess NaBH4 will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the Product:** The product, pentane-2,4-diol, has two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n    *   Structure: `CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3`\n    *   Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, the overall mixture of products must be achiral.\n    *   The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   The molecule is symmetric. Let's analyze the isomers:\n        *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since they are formed from an achiral starting material, they will be produced in equal amounts, forming a racemic mixture.\n        *   (2R, 4S) is identical to (2S, 4R). This isomer has an internal plane of symmetry in one of its conformations and is an achiral **meso compound**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomers are formed: a racemic pair of enantiomers ((±)-pentane-2,4-diol) and a meso compound (meso-pentane-2,4-diol). The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the combined mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC is an **achiral** separation technique. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore **cannot be separated**. They will elute together as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** and **constitutional isomers** have different physical properties and **can be separated**.\n*   Let's count the separable species in the combined mixture:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n    3.  The racemic mixture of (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n    4.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n*   Species 1 and 2 are diastereomers, so they will separate into **two peaks**.\n*   Species 3 (the enantiomeric pair) will elute as **one peak**.\n*   Species 4 (the meso compound) is a diastereomer of the compounds in species 3, so it will be separated from them, giving **one peak**.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C7 ethers/alcohols) are constitutional isomers of the products from Reaction II (C5 diols), so they are structurally very different and will have different retention times.\n*   Total peaks = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the combined mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   Chiral HPLC uses a **chiral** stationary phase. This chiral environment allows for the separation of **enantiomers**, in addition to diastereomers and constitutional isomers.\n*   Essentially, a chiral column can separate all stereoisomers that are not identical.\n*   Let's count the distinct stereoisomers in the mixture:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   All five of these are distinct chemical compounds. The chiral column can differentiate between the enantiomers (3 and 4) as well as all the diastereomeric and constitutional relationships.\n*   Therefore, we expect to see a separate peak for each of the five stereoisomers.\n*   Total peaks = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Summary**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is a six-carbon chain with a ketone at position 3 and a methoxy group (-OCH3) at position 5.\n    *   The carbon at position 5 is a chiral center with an (S) configuration. This means the starting material is enantiomerically pure.\n    *   Structure: `CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(S)(OCH3)-CH3`\n*   **Reagents:** The reactant is treated with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH, LiAlH4), followed by an acidic workup (H3O+).\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. The reagent itself is achiral.\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the ketone at C3 creates a new chiral center. The hydride ion (H-) can attack the planar carbonyl group from either the top face or the bottom face.\n    *   This non-selective attack on the C3 carbonyl will produce both (R) and (S) configurations at the new C3 chiral center.\n    *   The original chiral center at C5 remains unchanged (it keeps its S configuration).\n    *   Therefore, two products are formed:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship between products:** These two products have the same connectivity but different stereochemistry at one of their two chiral centers. This makes them **diastereomers**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** The starting material is pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone).\n    *   Structure: `CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3`\n    *   This molecule is **achiral** as it possesses a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reagents:** The reactant is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH4), followed by an acidic workup (H3O+).\n    *   NaBH4 is also a reducing agent for ketones. \"Excess\" indicates that both ketone groups will be reduced to secondary alcohols. The reagent is achiral.\n*   **Products:** The reduction of both ketones at C2 and C4 creates two new chiral centers. The product is pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   Let's analyze these stereoisomers:\n        *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol are **enantiomers** of each other. Since the reaction starts with an achiral reactant and uses an achiral reagent, this pair of enantiomers will be produced in a 1:1 ratio, forming a **racemic mixture**.\n        *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol has an internal plane of symmetry. This makes it a **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration represents the same meso compound.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction II produces three distinct stereoisomers: the (R,R) enantiomer, the (S,S) enantiomer, and the meso compound.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of five different compounds:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n\n**Analysis with Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column):**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   The two products from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and **will be separated**. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   The three products from Reaction II are a pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) and a meso compound.\n    *   The enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and **will not be separated**, eluting together as a single peak.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It has different physical properties and **will be separated** from the enantiomeric pair's peak.\n    *   This gives **2 peaks** from the products of Reaction II.\n*   The products of Reaction I (C7H16O2) and Reaction II (C5H12O2) are structurally very different (different molecular formulas and weights) and will be easily separated from each other.\n*   Total peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Analysis with Chiral HPLC (Chiral Stationary Phase):**\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation. It can also separate diastereomers and constitutional isomers.\n*   All five stereoisomers in the mixture are chemically distinct.\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (diastereomer of 1, will be separated)\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (enantiomer of 3, will be separated by the chiral column)\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (diastereomer of 3 & 4, will be separated)\n*   Since all five compounds are unique stereoisomers, a chiral column is capable of resolving all of them.\n*   Total peaks in chiral HPLC = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe analysis predicts **5 peaks in chiral HPLC** and **4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC**. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   It has one chiral center at carbon 5 (C5), with an (S) configuration. This chiral center is not affected by the reaction.\n*   **Reagents:** LAH (Lithium aluminum hydride) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Reaction:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol. This reduction creates a new chiral center at C3.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The hydride ion (H⁻) can attack the planar carbonyl group from either the front face or the back face. This leads to the formation of two possible configurations (R or S) at the new chiral center (C3).\n*   **Products of Reaction I:**\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** Since one chiral center is the same ((S) at C5) and the other is different ((R) vs (S) at C3), these two products are **diastereomers**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral (it has a plane of symmetry).\n*   **Reagents:** Excess NaBH₄ (Sodium borohydride) followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction:** NaBH₄ reduces both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, forming pentane-2,4-diol. The reduction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, all possible stereoisomers will be formed. The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   **(2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S):** These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are **enantiomers**. They will be formed in a 1:1 ratio, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C3. A chiral molecule with an internal plane of symmetry is called a **meso compound**.\n    *   **(2S, 4R):** This is identical to the (2R, 4S) meso compound (rotating the molecule 180° in the plane of the paper shows they are the same).\n*   **Products of Reaction II:**\n    1.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    2.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    3.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso compound)\n*   **Relationship:** The products are a pair of enantiomers and their diastereomer (the meso compound). In total, there are three distinct stereoisomers.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains all five products from both reactions:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n\n**Analysis on Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column):**\n\n*   An achiral column separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n*   It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers.\n*   It **cannot** separate enantiomers, which have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Enantiomers will elute together as a single peak.\n*   Let's count the peaks:\n    *   The products from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. They have different properties and will separate. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction II consist of a meso compound and a racemic pair of enantiomers. The meso compound ((2R, 4S)-diol) is a diastereomer of the enantiomers ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-diols). Therefore, the meso compound will separate from the enantiomeric pair. The enantiomers themselves will not separate and will elute as one peak. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are constitutional isomers with different molecular formulas and structures. They will have significantly different retention times and will not co-elute.\n    *   Total peaks = (Peaks from Rxn I) + (Peaks from Rxn II) = 2 + 2 = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Analysis on Chiral HPLC:**\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with different stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n*   It can separate all five distinct stereoisomers present in the mixture.\n*   Let's count the peaks:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 1)\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 2)\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 3)\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 4)\n    5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso) (Peak 5)\n*   Total peaks = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe analysis shows there will be **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram and **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral ketone with one stereocenter at the C5 position, with an (S) configuration.\n    *   Structure: CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol. This reaction is followed by an acidic workup to protonate the resulting alkoxide.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. Since the starting material already has a stereocenter at C5, the attack of the hydride ion (H-) on the two faces of the carbonyl group is not equally probable. This leads to the formation of two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Relationship:** These two products have the same connectivity but are not mirror images of each other (the mirror image of (3R, 5S) is (3S, 5R)). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral diketone.\n    *   Structure: CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4) reduces both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Product:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   Structure: CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The product has two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. Since the starting material and reagent are achiral, we must consider all possible stereoisomers. The molecule is symmetric around the C3 carbon.\n    1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These two are non-superimposable mirror images, making them a pair of **enantiomers**. They will be formed in equal amounts, creating a racemic mixture.\n    2.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This stereoisomer has a plane of symmetry passing through the C3 atom and is therefore an achiral **meso compound**. (Note: (2S, 4R) is the same meso compound).\n*   **Relationship:** The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the enantiomeric pair.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomeric products are formed: a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the combined product mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC uses an achiral stationary phase and separates compounds based on differences in polarity. It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis of the mixture:**\n    *   **From Reaction I:** The two products are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, including polarity, so they will have different retention times and will be separated into **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** The three products consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The two enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) have identical polarities and will not be separated, eluting together as **1 peak**. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers, has a different polarity, and will be separated, giving a second, distinct **1 peak**. Thus, the products of Reaction II will show **2 peaks**.\n    *   **Combined:** The products from Reaction I (C7 ether-alcohols) are structurally distinct from the products of Reaction II (C5 diols) and will have different polarities. Therefore, it is assumed that none of the peaks from Reaction I will accidentally overlap with peaks from Reaction II.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 peaks (from Reaction I) + 2 peaks (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the combined product mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. This allows for the separation of all different stereoisomers, including **both diastereomers and enantiomers**.\n*   **Analysis of the mixture:**\n    *   **From Reaction I:** The two diastereomeric products will be separated, resulting in **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** The three stereoisomeric products will all be separated from each other. The two enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase and will be resolved into **2 separate peaks**. The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also have a unique retention time, giving **1 peak**. Thus, the products of Reaction II will show **3 peaks**.\n    *   **Combined:** Again, assuming no accidental overlap between the products of the two reactions.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** 2 peaks (from Reaction I) + 3 peaks (from Reaction II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts:\n*   **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n*   **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(OCH₃)-CH₃.\n    *   It has one stereocenter at carbon C5, with the (S) configuration. This stereocenter is not affected by the reaction.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Reaction:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Product Stereochemistry:** The carbonyl carbon at C3 is prochiral. The reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3. The hydride ion (H⁻) can attack the planar carbonyl group from either the front face or the back face. This results in the formation of two possible configurations at C3: (R) and (S).\n*   **Products of Reaction I:** Since the original stereocenter at C5 remains (S), the reaction produces a mixture of two diastereomers:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    These two compounds are diastereomers because they have one stereocenter that is the same (5S) and one that is different (3R vs. 3S).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral; it has a plane of symmetry passing through the central CH₂ group.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction:** NaBH₄ reduces both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Product Stereochemistry:** The reduction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** are enantiomers of each other. They will be formed as a racemic mixture (equal amounts).\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** has a plane of symmetry (it can be drawn in a conformation where the top half is a mirror image of the bottom half). Therefore, it is a **meso compound**. A meso compound is achiral and superimposable on its mirror image. This means (2R, 4S) is identical to (2S, 4R).\n*   **Products of Reaction II:** The reaction produces three distinct stereoisomers:\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol ((2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol)\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC is an achiral technique. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated. They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated.\n*   **Applying to the mixture:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. They have different shapes and polarities and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) and a meso compound.\n        *   The enantiomers (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) will co-elute, giving **one peak**.\n        *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It has different physical properties and will be separated, giving a **second peak**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are structurally very different (different molecular weight, different functional groups - ether vs. diol). They will have significantly different polarities and will be easily separated from each other.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** The two peaks from Reaction I products plus the two peaks from Reaction II products result in a total of **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase (CSP). The CSP interacts differently with different stereoisomers, allowing for the separation of both enantiomers and diastereomers.\n*   **Applying to the mixture:** The combined mixture contains a total of five unique stereoisomers:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** Since a chiral column can resolve all distinct stereoisomers, and there are five stereoisomers in the mixture, the chromatogram will show **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **Goal:** Determine the number of peaks in two different HPLC analyses (normal-phase and chiral) of a combined product mixture.\n    *   **Source of products:** Two separate chemical reactions.\n    *   **Reaction I:** Reduction of a chiral ketone, (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, with LAH.\n    *   **Reaction II:** Reduction of an achiral diketone, pentane-2,4-dione, with NaBH4.\n    *   **Analysis I:** Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds by polarity. It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but *not* enantiomers.\n    *   **Analysis II:** Chiral HPLC separates compounds based on their interaction with a chiral stationary phase. It can separate constitutional isomers, diastereomers, *and* enantiomers.\n\n2.  **Plan the Analysis:**\n    *   **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I.** Determine the structure and stereochemistry of the product(s).\n    *   **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II.** Determine the structure and stereochemistry of the product(s).\n    *   **Step 3: Combine the products.** List all unique molecules formed.\n    *   **Step 4: Predict the number of peaks for Normal-Phase HPLC.** Group enantiomers together, but separate diastereomers and constitutional isomers.\n    *   **Step 5: Predict the number of peaks for Chiral HPLC.** Count every unique stereoisomer.\n    *   **Step 6: Match the results to the given options.**\n\n3.  **Execute the Plan:**\n\n    *   **Action 1: Analyze Reaction I.**\n        *   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a ketone with one existing stereocenter at carbon 5.\n        *   **Reagent:** LAH (Lithium aluminum hydride) is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone (C=O) at carbon 3 to an alcohol (CH-OH).\n        *   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The reduction of the planar carbonyl group creates a *new* stereocenter at carbon 3. The original stereocenter at carbon 5 is unaffected. The hydride can attack from two different faces, creating both (R) and (S) configurations at the new center.\n        *   **Products of Reaction I:**\n            *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n            *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        *   **Relationship:** These two products have the same connectivity but different stereochemistry at one center (C3) while the other is the same (C5). They are **diastereomers**.\n        *   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Produces 2 diastereomeric compounds.\n\n    *   **Action 2: Analyze Reaction II.**\n        *   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is a symmetric, achiral diketone.\n        *   **Reagent:** Excess NaBH4 will reduce both ketone groups to alcohols, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n        *   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The reaction creates two new stereocenters at carbons 2 and 4. We must consider all possible combinations: (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n        *   **Products of Reaction II:**\n            *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. These are non-superimposable mirror images, so they are an **enantiomeric pair**.\n            *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry between C2 and C4. It is a **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration is the same molecule, just flipped over.\n        *   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Produces 3 stereoisomers in total: one pair of enantiomers and one meso compound.\n\n    *   **Action 3: Predict Normal-Phase HPLC Peaks.**\n        *   Normal-phase HPLC separates based on polarity. Enantiomers have identical polarities and co-elute (give one peak). Diastereomers and constitutional isomers have different polarities and separate.\n        *   **From Reaction I:** The two products are diastereomers. They will separate. -> **2 peaks**.\n        *   **From Reaction II:** The enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) will co-elute. -> **1 peak**. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will elute separately. -> **1 peak**.\n        *   **Total Normal-Phase Peaks:** The products from Reaction I are constitutionally different from the products of Reaction II, so they will all be distinct. Total peaks = 2 (from I) + 1 (enantiomers from II) + 1 (meso from II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n    *   **Action 4: Predict Chiral HPLC Peaks.**\n        *   Chiral HPLC separates all stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n        *   **From Reaction I:** The two diastereomers will separate. -> **2 peaks**.\n        *   **From Reaction II:** The enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) will be resolved into two separate peaks. -> **2 peaks**. The meso compound is achiral but is a distinct molecule from the others, so it will give its own peak. -> **1 peak**.\n        *   **Total Chiral HPLC Peaks:** Total peaks = 2 (from I) + 2 (enantiomers from II) + 1 (meso from II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n    *   **Action 5: Final Conclusion.**\n        *   The analysis predicts 5 peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.\n        *   This corresponds to option D.\n\nThe plan is complete and the logic is sound. I am confident in the result.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nAn analysis of the reactions and the resulting products is required to determine the number of peaks in the chromatograms.\n\n### **Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a chiral ketone. The stereocenter is at the C5 position.\n*   **Reaction:** It is treated with lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. LAH reduces the ketone at C3 to a hydroxyl group.\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. Since the starting material is chiral and the reducing agent is achiral, the hydride can attack the planar carbonyl from either face. This results in the formation of two products that are diastereomers of each other:\n    *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n\nThese two compounds are diastereomers because one stereocenter is the same (S at C5) while the other is different (R or S at C3).\n\n### **Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reaction:** It is treated with excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4), which reduces both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups, followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Products:** The reduction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. This leads to the formation of three stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol:\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol:** This is a pair of enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images).\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol:** This is a meso compound. It is achiral because it has a plane of symmetry, and it is a diastereomer of the other two products.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of five different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n\n### **Chromatographic Separation**\n\n**Normal-Phase HPLC:**\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated by normal-phase HPLC.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated by a normal-phase (achiral) column.\n\nBased on this, we can predict the number of peaks:\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, will separate into **two peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will co-elute as a **single peak**.\n*   The meso compound, (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have a different retention time, resulting in a **separate peak**.\n*   The products of Reaction I (methoxy-alcohols) and Reaction II (diols) are structurally distinct molecules with different polarities and will be separated from each other.\n\nTherefore, the total number of peaks in the normal-phase HPLC will be 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Chiral HPLC:**\nChiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase that can differentiate between stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n*   It can separate diastereomers.\n*   It can separate enantiomers.\n\nTherefore, all five unique stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 1)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 2)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 3)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 4)\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 5)\n\nThis results in a total of **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe chemist will observe 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms:\n\n### Reaction I\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a ketone with a single chiral center at the C5 position.\n*   **Reaction:** It is treated with lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, which reduces the ketone at the C3 position to a hydroxyl group. This reduction creates a new chiral center at C3.\n*   **Products:** The attack of the hydride on the planar carbonyl group can occur from two different faces. Since the starting material is already chiral, this leads to the formation of two different products that are diastereomers of each other: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n\n### Reaction II\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reaction:** It is treated with sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), which reduces both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Products:** The reduction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4. This results in the formation of three stereoisomers:\n    *   A pair of enantiomers: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   A meso compound: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, which is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\n### Combined Products\n\nAfter both reactions are complete, the product mixture contains a total of five distinct compounds:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis\n\n**Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column):**\nThis technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore will not be separated.\n*   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n\nLet's analyze the mixture:\n*   The two products from Reaction I, (3S, 5S)- and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will elute together as a **single peak**.\n*   The meso compound, (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will be separated, resulting in another **single peak**.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C7 alcohols) and Reaction II (C5 diols) are structurally different and will have different retention times.\n\nTherefore, the total number of peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram will be 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Chiral HPLC (Chiral Stationary Phase):**\nThis technique is designed to separate chiral molecules, including enantiomers.\n*   The chiral stationary phase interacts differently with each enantiomer, allowing for their separation.\n\nLet's analyze the five compounds in the mixture:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (chiral)\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (chiral)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (chiral)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (chiral)\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (achiral, meso)\n\n*   The chiral column will separate the two diastereomers from Reaction I.\n*   It will also separate the enantiomeric pair from Reaction II.\n*   The achiral meso compound will elute as a single peak, separated from the other compounds.\n\nAssuming the column can resolve all distinct species, each of the five compounds will produce a separate peak. Thus, the total number of peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram will be **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe chemist will observe 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatographic separation:\n\n### **Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a ketone with a pre-existing chiral center at the C5 position, with the (S) configuration.\n2.  **Reaction:** The ketone at the C3 position is reduced to a secondary alcohol by Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent. This reduction creates a new chiral center at C3.\n3.  **Products:** Since the hydride from the achiral LAH can attack the planar carbonyl group from either the top or bottom face, two different stereoisomers are formed. The original chiral center at C5 remains unchanged (S configuration). The new chiral center at C3 can be either (R) or (S). This results in the formation of two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n4.  **Stereochemical Relationship:** These two products are diastereomers because they have multiple chiral centers and are not mirror images of each other.\n\n### **Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral diketone.\n2.  **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols by excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄). This creates two new chiral centers at the C2 and C4 positions.\n3.  **Products:** The reduction of an achiral starting material with an achiral reagent produces all possible stereoisomers. The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), and (2R, 4S).\n4.  **Stereochemical Relationship:**\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol are enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images).\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol is a meso compound. It has chiral centers, but it is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry. The (2S, 4R) configuration is identical to the (2R, 4S) one.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction II produces a total of three distinct stereoisomers.\n\n### **Chromatographic Analysis of the Combined Products**\n\nThe final mixture contains five different compounds: the two diastereomers from Reaction I and the three stereoisomers (the enantiomeric pair and the meso compound) from Reaction II.\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\nA normal-phase HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   **From Reaction I:** The two products, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** The enantiomers, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound, (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, is a diastereomer of the enantiomers and has different physical properties, so it will be separated as a distinct peak. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   **Total Peaks:** Assuming the products of Reaction I and Reaction II are all resolved from each other, the total number of peaks will be 2 + 2 = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC**\n\nA chiral HPLC column has a stationary phase that is itself chiral, allowing it to interact differently with enantiomers and thus separate them.\n*   **From Reaction I:** The two diastereomers will be separated, giving **2 peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** The chiral column will separate the (2R, 4R) enantiomer from the (2S, 4S) enantiomer. The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also be separated. This results in **3 peaks**.\n*   **Total Peaks:** The total number of peaks observed will be the sum of all separable compounds, which is 2 + 3 = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe chemist will observe 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n1.  **Stereochemistry of Starting Materials:** Identify if the starting materials are chiral or achiral.\n2.  **Nature of the Reaction:** Understand how the reagents (LAH, NaBH4) affect the functional groups (ketones).\n3.  **Creation of New Stereocenters:** Determine if the reactions create new chiral centers.\n4.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** Predict the stereoisomers formed (enantiomers, diastereomers, meso compounds) and their relationships.\n5.  **Principles of HPLC Separation:**\n    *   **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral):** Separates compounds based on polarity. It can separate diastereomers but cannot separate enantiomers.\n    *   **Chiral HPLC:** Uses a chiral stationary phase to separate enantiomers. It can also separate diastereomers.\n6.  **Combined Mixture:** The final analysis is on the combined products of both reactions. We must assume that structurally distinct molecules (e.g., products from Reaction I vs. Reaction II) and diastereomers will not accidentally have the same retention time.\n\n---\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This molecule has one stereocenter at carbon 5 (C5) and is therefore chiral.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol by Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH). This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** The original stereocenter at C5 is not affected by the reaction. The new stereocenter at C3 can be either (R) or (S). This results in the formation of two products:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products have the same molecular formula but different spatial arrangements. One stereocenter is the same ((S) at C5) while the other is different ((R) vs. (S) at C3). This makes them **diastereomers**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is symmetric and achiral.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups at C2 and C4 are reduced to secondary alcohols by excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH4). This creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol. We must consider all possible stereoisomers. The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images. They are a pair of **enantiomers**.\n    *   (2R, 4S) has an internal plane of symmetry and is superimposable on its mirror image, (2S, 4R). This is a single, achiral **meso compound**.\n*   **Relationship:** The reaction starts with an achiral molecule and produces all possible stereoisomers. Therefore, the products are a mixture of three compounds:\n    1.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    2.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    3.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso compound)\n    The two enantiomers will be formed in equal amounts, creating a racemic mixture. The meso compound is a diastereomer of each of the enantiomers.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture on Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates diastereomers but not enantiomers.\n*   **From Reaction I:** We have two diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** We have a meso compound and a racemic pair of enantiomers.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers, so it will be separated from them, giving **1 peak**.\n    *   The two enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) are inseparable on an achiral column and will elute together as **1 peak**.\n    *   Thus, the products from Reaction II give a total of **2 peaks**.\n*   **Total Peaks:** The products from Reaction I (C7 compounds) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (C5 compounds) and will elute at different times.\n    *   Total Peaks = (Peaks from Rxn I) + (Peaks from Rxn II) = 2 + 2 = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture on Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   Chiral HPLC separates both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n*   **From Reaction I:** We have two diastereomers. They will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** We have a meso compound and a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   The meso compound is achiral and will give **1 peak**.\n    *   The two enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) will be separated by the chiral column, giving **2 peaks**.\n    *   Thus, the products from Reaction II give a total of **3 peaks**.\n*   **Total Peaks:** Again, assuming no accidental overlap between the two sets of products.\n    *   Total Peaks = (Peaks from Rxn I) + (Peaks from Rxn II) = 2 + 3 = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Number of peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 4\n*   Number of peaks in chiral HPLC = 5\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a detailed analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatographic separations:\n\n### **Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a chiral ketone. The stereocenter at carbon 5 has the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** It is treated with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. LAH will reduce the ketone at carbon 3 to a hydroxyl group.\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. Since the starting material is chiral and the reducing agent (LAH) is achiral, the hydride can attack the planar carbonyl group from either face. This results in the formation of two products with different configurations (R or S) at the newly formed chiral center (C3).\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:** These two products are diastereomers because they have one stereocenter that is the same (5S) and one that is different (3R vs. 3S).\n\n### **Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reaction:** It is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH4), a reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. NaBH4 will reduce both ketone groups at carbons 2 and 4 to hydroxyl groups.\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the two ketones creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. The possible stereoisomers are:\n    *   Product 3: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Product 4: (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Product 5: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:**\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, making them a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol has an internal plane of symmetry, which makes it a meso compound. It is achiral.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n    *   Therefore, this reaction produces three distinct stereoisomers.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of five different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n\n### **Chromatographic Separation**\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\nA normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, primarily polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers**, having identical physical properties in an achiral environment, will not be separated and will elute as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated.\n*   The two products from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers and will therefore produce **two separate peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will co-elute as **one peak**.\n*   The meso compound, (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have a different polarity, resulting in a **separate, second peak** for the products of Reaction II.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C7 alcohols with an ether group) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (C5 diols) and will have different retention times.\n*   Therefore, the total number of peaks observed will be 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC**\nAn HPLC with a chiral stationary phase is designed to separate stereoisomers, including enantiomers. It can distinguish between all five unique stereoisomers present in the mixture.\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol will give **one peak**.\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol will give a **second peak**.\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol will give a **third peak**.\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol will give a **fourth peak**.\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (the meso compound) is also a unique stereoisomer and will give a **fifth peak**.\n*   Therefore, the total number of peaks observed in the chiral HPLC chromatogram will be **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nBased on the analysis:\n\n*   **Reaction I** produces two diastereomers: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Reaction II** produces three stereoisomers: an enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) and a meso compound (meso-pentane-2,4-diol).\n*   In total, there are **5 unique stereoisomers** in the final mixture.\n\n**HPLC Analysis:**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC** can separate all 5 unique stereoisomers, resulting in **5 peaks**.\n*   **Normal-phase (achiral) HPLC** separates diastereomers but not enantiomers.\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I give 2 peaks.\n    *   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair gives 1 peak, and the meso compound gives a separate peak (2 peaks total).\n    *   The products from the two reactions are structurally different and will not co-elute.\n    *   Total peaks = 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\nThe final result is 5 peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\n### Analysis of the Reactions and Products\n\n**Reaction I:**\nThe starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, a chiral ketone. It is treated with lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. The reduction of the ketone at the C3 position creates a new stereocenter. Since there is a pre-existing stereocenter at C5, the hydride attack on the carbonyl group is not equally probable from both faces. This results in the formation of two diastereomers: (3S,5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R,5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n\n**Reaction II:**\nThe starting material is pentane-2,4-dione, an achiral diketone. It is treated with excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4), which reduces both ketone groups to alcohols. This reaction creates two new stereocenters at positions C2 and C4. The possible products are (2R,4R)-pentane-2,4-diol, (2S,4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, and (2R,4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. The (2R,4R) and (2S,4S) isomers are a pair of enantiomers. The (2R,4S) isomer is a meso compound, as it has an internal plane of symmetry and is achiral. Therefore, Reaction II produces a total of three stereoisomers.\n\n### Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe final mixture that is analyzed contains a total of five different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3S,5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3R,5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R,4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S,4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.

This is a chiral ketone with a stereocenter at the C5 position. It is treated with Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, which reduces the ketone at C3 to an alcohol. This reduction creates a new stereocenter at the C3 position. Since the starting material is chiral and the reducing agent is achiral, the hydride can attack the planar carbonyl group from either face, resulting in the formation of two products: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two products are diastereomers because they have one stereocenter in common (C5) and one that is different (C3).\n\n*   **Products of Reaction I:** A mixture of two diastereomers.\n\n**Reaction II:**\nThe starting material is pentane-2,4-dione, an achiral diketone. It is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH4), which reduces both ketone groups to alcohols, forming pentane-2,4-diol. The reduction of the carbonyls at C2 and C4 creates two new stereocenters. The possible stereoisomers are:\n1.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n2.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n3.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n\nThe (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are a pair of enantiomers. The (2R, 4S) isomer has an internal plane of symmetry and is therefore an achiral meso compound. The reduction of an achiral starting material with an achiral reagent produces all possible stereoisomers, so the product is a mixture of the racemic pair and the meso compound.\n\n*   **Products of Reaction II:** A mixture of three stereoisomers (one pair of enantiomers and one meso compound).\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis\n\nThe products from both reactions are combined, resulting in a total of five different stereoisomers to be analyzed.\n\n**Normal-Phase HPLC:**\nThis technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, primarily polarity. The stationary phase is achiral (e.g., silica).\n*   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n*   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated; they will elute together as a single peak.\n\nApplying this to the product mixture:\n1.  The two diastereomers from Reaction I ((3S, 5S)- and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol) will have different polarities and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n2.  From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) will co-elute as **one peak**.\n3.  The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have a different polarity, eluting as a separate, **second peak** from the Reaction II products.\n4.  The products of Reaction I (C7 ether-alcohols) and Reaction II (C5 diols) are structurally very different and will have distinct polarities, ensuring they do not accidentally elute at the same time.\n\nTherefore, the total number of peaks in the normal-phase HPLC is 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Chiral HPLC:**\nThis technique uses a chiral stationary phase (CSP) which allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n*   It can separate all stereoisomers, including both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n\nApplying this to the product mixture:\n1.  The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated, giving **two peaks**.\n2.  The enantiomeric pair from Reaction II will be resolved by the chiral column into **two separate peaks**.\n3.  The meso compound from Reaction II is achiral and will produce a single, distinct **one peak**.\n\nTherefore, the total number of peaks in the chiral HPLC is 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis predicts 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
