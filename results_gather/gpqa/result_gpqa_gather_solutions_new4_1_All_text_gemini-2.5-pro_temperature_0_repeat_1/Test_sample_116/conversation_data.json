This property can arise from a chiral center (typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or from axial chirality, as seen in some substituted biphenyls. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:** This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. The bulky nitro (-NO₂) and dimethyl dicarboxylate (-COOCH₃) groups at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6') of the phenyl rings create significant steric hindrance. This hindrance restricts free rotation around the single bond connecting the two biphenyl rings. Because the substitution pattern lacks a plane of symmetry, the molecule is chiral and exists as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers). This specific type of stereoisomerism is known as atropisomerism. Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** Also known as methyl lactate, this compound has a carbon atom at the second position that is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). A carbon atom attached to four distinct groups is a chiral center. Consequently, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a chiral molecule and exists as two enantiomers, (R)-methyl lactate and (S)-methyl lactate, which are optically active.\n\n3.  **Benzophenone:** The benzophenone molecule consists of a central carbonyl group attached to two phenyl rings. In solution, the phenyl rings can rotate. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the carbonyl group, making it achiral. Although benzophenone can crystallize in a chiral arrangement, the individual molecule itself is not chiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism in solution.\n\n4.  **Dimethyl fumarate:** This is the methyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond with identical substituents on each carbon atom of the double bond. It possesses a center of symmetry and a plane of symmetry, making it an achiral molecule. Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate are the compounds that show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine which of the given organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism, each molecule must be assessed for chirality. A molecule is chiral, and therefore optically active, if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This typically arises from the presence of a chiral center or an axis of chirality.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This compound is a substituted biphenyl. Due to the large size of the nitro (-NO2) and dimethyl dicarboxylate (-COOCH3) groups at the ortho positions (6, 6', 2, and 2'), there is significant steric hindrance that restricts free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, makes the molecule chiral as it lacks a plane of symmetry. Biphenyls with bulky ortho substituents are classic examples of molecules that exhibit this type of optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule contains a carbon atom (at position 2) that is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four different substituents is a chiral center. The presence of this stereocenter means the molecule can exist as two non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers), specifically methyl (R)-lactate and methyl (S)-lactate. Therefore, it is optically active.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The chemical structure of benzophenone is (C6H5)2CO. The central carbonyl carbon is bonded to two phenyl groups and double-bonded to an oxygen atom. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that bisects the C=O bond and the angle between the two phenyl rings. Because it has a plane of symmetry and lacks a chiral center, benzophenone is an achiral molecule and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This molecule is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The molecule is planar and has a center of inversion, which is a point of symmetry. Any molecule with a center of inversion is achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is not optically active.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate are the two compounds that show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nAn organic compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This property is most commonly due to the presence of a chiral center (an atom bonded to four different groups) or due to restricted rotation that creates a chiral axis (atropisomerism). Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:\n    *   This is a substituted biphenyl compound. In biphenyls, if there are bulky substituents at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'), the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is restricted.\n    *   In this molecule, all four ortho positions are substituted with bulky groups: two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH₃) and two nitro groups (-NO₂).\n    *   This steric hindrance prevents the molecule from becoming planar. The two rings are forced into a non-planar, twisted conformation.\n    *   Because the substitution pattern on each ring is asymmetric (e.g., on one ring, you have -COOCH₃ at position 2 and -NO₂ at position 6), the molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is chiral and its mirror image is non-superimposable. This phenomenon is called atropisomerism, a form of axial chirality. The compound will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   To check for chirality, we look for a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group):\n        *   Group 1: -H (hydrogen)\n        *   Group 2: -OH (hydroxyl)\n        *   Group 3: -CH₃ (methyl)\n        *   Group 4: -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)\n    *   Since all four groups attached to this carbon are different, it is a chiral center.\n    *   A molecule with one chiral center is always chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**:\n    *   The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. It consists of a central carbonyl carbon double-bonded to an oxygen and single-bonded to two phenyl rings.\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers.\n    *   The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   Due to the presence of this plane of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and superimposable on its mirror image. It does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**:\n    *   This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans* isomer of but-2-enedioic acid.\n    *   The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   The molecule is planar and has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n    *   Any molecule with a center of inversion is achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is not optically active.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nCompounds 1 and 2 are chiral and will show optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and will not.\n\nTherefore, the correct option includes only 1 and 2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nAn analysis of the question and the provided options is performed step-by-step.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definition of optical isomerism.**\nOptical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is considered chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicator of chirality is the presence of a chiral center (an atom, typically carbon, bonded to four different groups). However, chirality can also arise from other structural features like restricted rotation in certain molecules (axial chirality) or specific planar structures (planar chirality), as long as the molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze each compound for chirality.**\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl system, meaning two benzene rings are connected by a single C-C bond. The name indicates the following substituents:\n    *   Two nitro groups (-NO2) at positions 6 and 6'.\n    *   Two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3) at positions 2 and 2'.\n*   **Careful Point (Atropisomerism):** In biphenyl systems, if there are bulky groups at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6'), the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings is hindered. This steric hindrance can lock the molecule into a twisted, non-planar conformation.\n*   **Analysis:** In this molecule, all four ortho positions are substituted with bulky groups (-NO2 and -COOCH3). This severe steric hindrance prevents the rings from becoming coplanar. The resulting twisted structure lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Therefore, the molecule is chiral and its mirror image is non-superimposable. This phenomenon is known as atropisomerism, a type of axial chirality.\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound shows optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Structure:** This is the methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid (lactic acid). Its chemical structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n*   **Careful Point (Chiral Center):** We need to check for the presence of a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n*   **Analysis:** Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the hydroxyl group). The four groups attached to this carbon are:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center.\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a chiral center makes the molecule chiral. Thus, it exists as a pair of enantiomers and shows optical isomerism.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n*   **Structure:** The chemical name for benzophenone is diphenyl ketone. Its structure is C6H5-C(=O)-C6H5.\n*   **Careful Point (Symmetry):** We need to check for elements of symmetry like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n*   **Analysis:** The molecule consists of a central carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two identical phenyl groups (C6H5). There are no chiral centers. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is an achiral molecule and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans* isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Careful Point (Geometric vs. Optical Isomerism and Symmetry):** This molecule is a geometric isomer (*trans*). We need to determine if it is also optically active. We must check for symmetry elements.\n*   **Analysis:** The molecule is planar. This molecular plane itself acts as a plane of symmetry. Furthermore, it has a center of inversion located at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. The presence of either a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion makes a molecule achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is an achiral molecule and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Step 3: Final Conclusion**\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Compound 1 (dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate) is chiral and shows optical isomerism.\n*   Compound 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) is chiral and shows optical isomerism.\n*   Compound 3 (benzophenone) is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n*   Compound 4 (dimethyl fumarate) is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the correct combination is compounds 1 and 2. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nA compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Let's analyze each compound for chirality.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This is a substituted biphenyl molecule. The two phenyl rings are connected by a single bond. Usually, there is free rotation around this bond. However, in this case, there are large, bulky groups (nitro groups and dimethyl carboxylate groups) at all four *ortho* positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). These bulky groups sterically hinder the rotation around the central single bond, forcing the two rings to be non-coplanar. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, creates a chiral axis, making the molecule chiral and thus optically active.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2. It is bonded to four different groups:\n    *   a hydrogen atom (-H)\n    *   a hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    *   a methyl group (-CH₃)\n    *   a methyl carboxylate group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon is bonded to four different substituents, it is a chiral center (or stereocenter). A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral and therefore optically active.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O.

It is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans* isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon double bond. The molecule is planar and has a center of inversion (a point of symmetry) at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.

Here is a summary of the reasoning that leads to the final answer.\n\nOptical isomerism is exhibited by molecules that are chiral, meaning they are non-superimposable on their mirror images. We can assess each compound for chirality:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:** This molecule does not have a chiral carbon. However, it has bulky substituents (nitro and carboxylate groups) at all four ortho-positions to the bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This steric hindrance prevents free rotation around the central C-C single bond, creating a form of axial chirality known as atropisomerism. The molecule and its mirror image are non-superimposable enantiomers. Therefore, it is optically active.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The second carbon atom is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). This makes it a chiral center. The molecule exists as a pair of enantiomers and is therefore optically active.\n\n3.  **benzophenone:** The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the two phenyl rings. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral and cannot be optically active.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate:** This is the trans-isomer of an alkene with the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry. Due to these elements of symmetry, it is achiral and not optically active.\n\nBased on this analysis, only compounds 1 and 2 are optically active.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nOptical isomerism is a property exhibited by chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. Let's analyze each of the given compounds:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:** This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. Due to the presence of bulky substituents (nitro groups and carboxylate groups) at the ortho-positions (2, 2', 6, and 6') of the phenyl rings, the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings is severely restricted. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, leads to a stable chiral conformation. The molecule and its mirror image are non-superimposable, resulting in a pair of enantiomers. Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism. A closely related compound, 6,6'-dinitro-2,2'-diphenic acid, is a classic example of a molecule that is optically active due to this phenomenon.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** This compound, also known as methyl lactate, is the methyl ester of lactic acid. The carbon atom at the second position is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom attached to four different substituents is a chiral center. Molecules with a single chiral center are optically active. Indeed, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exists as two distinct enantiomers: (R)-methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and (S)-methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\n3.  **benzophenone:** The chemical formula for benzophenone is (C₆H₅)₂CO. The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. This molecule does not contain a chiral center. It possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the carbonyl group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image and is therefore achiral. Consequently, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The molecule has a center of symmetry (an inversion center) and a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. While it is a stereoisomer (a geometric isomer or diastereomer of dimethyl maleate), it is not optically active.\n\nBased on the analysis, only dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nTo determine which of the given organic moieties exhibit optical isomerism, we need to identify which molecules are chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common sources of chirality in organic molecules are chiral centers (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) and axial chirality (as seen in some substituted biphenyls).\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. Biphenyls can exhibit a type of chirality called atropisomerism if the rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is restricted. This typically happens when there are large, bulky substituents in the ortho positions (the 2, 2', 6, and 6' positions). In this compound, the nitro groups (-NO2) at the 6 and 6' positions and the dimethyl dicarboxylate groups (-COOCH3) at the 2 and 2' positions are large enough to prevent free rotation. This restricted rotation leads to two stable, non-superimposable mirror-image conformations (enantiomers). Therefore, this compound is optically active.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule has a central carbon atom (the second carbon in the propanoate chain) that is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four different substituents is a chiral center. Molecules with a single chiral center are chiral and therefore optically active (unless they are part of a racemic mixture).\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The central carbon atom in benzophenone is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. To be a chiral center, a carbon must be bonded to four *different* groups. Since this carbon is only bonded to three groups and two of them are identical (phenyl groups), it is not a chiral center. The molecule as a whole is achiral because it has a plane of symmetry and is superimposable on its mirror image. While it can crystallize into chiral solids, the individual molecule is not chiral.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of inversion symmetry, which makes it achiral. It does not have any chiral centers and is superimposable on its mirror image, so it does not show optical isomerism.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate are optically active.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nTo determine which of the given organic moieties show optical isomerism, each compound must be assessed for chirality. A molecule is chiral, and thus optically active, if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This often arises from a chiral center or axial chirality.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. Biphenyls can exhibit a type of stereoisomerism called atropisomerism when there is restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restriction is caused by bulky substituents at the ortho positions (the positions adjacent to the connecting bond). In this specific molecule, the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6') are occupied by large groups: two nitro groups (-NO2) and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3). These bulky groups prevent the two phenyl rings from rotating freely, which can lead to two stable, non-superimposable mirror-image conformations (enantiomers). Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism due to axial chirality.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule has a central carbon atom (the second carbon) bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four different substituents is a chiral center. Molecules with a single chiral center are chiral and optically active, existing as a pair of enantiomers (D and L isomers).\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The chemical formula for benzophenone is (C6H5)2CO. The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two identical phenyl groups. It does not possess a chiral center. While individual molecules can adopt a twisted, non-planar conformation, the molecule as a whole is achiral because it can easily interconvert between mirror-image conformations and possesses planes of symmetry in some conformations. It does not exhibit optical isomerism under normal conditions.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry, which makes it achiral. It does not have any chiral centers and cannot be optically active.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate (1) and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (2) are the compounds that show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nAn analysis of the question and the provided options is as follows:\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\nThe question asks to identify which of the given compounds exhibit optical isomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This property is often due to the presence of a chiral center or other elements of chirality like an axis or a plane of chirality.\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl derivative. The two phenyl rings are linked by a C-C single bond. There are bulky substituents at all four ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). Specifically, methyl carboxylate (-COOCH3) groups are at positions 2 and 2', and nitro (-NO2) groups are at positions 6 and 6'.\n*   **Careful Points:** Biphenyls with bulky substituents at the ortho positions can exhibit a special type of stereoisomerism called **atropisomerism**. This occurs because the steric hindrance from the bulky groups prevents free rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   **Restricted Rotation:** The nitro groups and methyl carboxylate groups are large enough to prevent the two phenyl rings from becoming coplanar. The rotation around the central C-C bond is severely restricted.\n    *   **Chirality Condition:** For an atropisomer to be chiral, the molecule must not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion in its stable, non-planar conformation. This is generally true if each ring is asymmetrically substituted. In this molecule, one ring has a -COOCH3 group at C2 and a -NO2 group at C6. The other ring has a -COOCH3 group at C2' and a -NO2 group at C6'.\n    *   **Symmetry:** Due to the restricted rotation, the rings are twisted relative to each other. In this non-planar conformation, the molecule does not possess a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Therefore, it is chiral and its mirror image is non-superimposable.\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound shows optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Structure:** The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. This is the methyl ester of lactic acid.\n*   **Careful Points:** The most common source of chirality in organic molecules is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n*   **Analysis:** Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group).\n    *   It is bonded to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    *   Since all four groups attached to this carbon are different, it is a chiral center.\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral and exists as a pair of enantiomers (R and S forms). Therefore, it shows optical isomerism.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n*   **Structure:** The structure is C6H5-C(=O)-C6H5. It is a ketone with two phenyl groups attached to the carbonyl carbon.\n*   **Careful Points:** We need to check for any elements of chirality.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The central carbonyl carbon is sp2 hybridized and is only bonded to three groups (one oxygen and two phenyl groups). It cannot be a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule possesses elements of symmetry. It has a C2 rotational axis passing through the C=O bond. It also has a plane of symmetry that contains the C=O group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings (assuming a stable, non-planar propeller-like conformation) or the molecular plane if it were planar. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is always achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, where the two ester groups are *trans* to each other across the C=C double bond.\n*   **Careful Points:** This molecule exhibits geometric (cis-trans) isomerism, but the question is about optical isomerism. We need to check for chirality.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The molecule is planar. Any planar molecule is achiral because the plane of the molecule itself acts as a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Alternatively, the molecule has a center of inversion (a point of symmetry) at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. A molecule with a center of inversion is always achiral.\n    *   There are no chiral centers in the molecule.\n*   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Final Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (atropisomerism).\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral center).\n*   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n*   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nTherefore, the compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nOptical isomerism is a property exhibited by chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. The most common sources of chirality in organic molecules are the presence of a chiral center (an atom, typically carbon, bonded to four different groups) or axial chirality, which can occur in molecules with hindered rotation about a single bond, such as in certain substituted biphenyls.\n\nHere is an analysis of each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. The presence of large groups (nitro and dimethyl dicarboxylate) in all four ortho-positions (the 2, 2', 6, and 6' positions) creates significant steric hindrance. This restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings forces the rings to be non-coplanar. This arrangement results in a molecule that is not superimposable on its mirror image, a condition known as atropisomerism. Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule contains a carbon atom (at position 2) that is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). A carbon atom with four different substituents is a chiral center. Molecules containing a single chiral center are chiral and thus optically active.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The chemical formula for benzophenone is (C₆H₅)₂CO. The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. Since it is not bonded to four different groups, it is not a chiral center. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry and is therefore achiral, meaning it does not exhibit optical isomerism in solution.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This compound is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The molecule is planar and has a center of symmetry, which makes it achiral. Consequently, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate are the compounds that show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe code successfully analyzed four organic compounds for optical isomerism.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate** was identified as having optical isomerism due to atropisomerism, a form of axial chirality caused by restricted rotation around the central single bond.\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** was identified as having optical isomerism because it contains a chiral carbon atom bonded to four distinct groups.\n3.  **benzophenone** was identified as achiral because it possesses a plane of symmetry, making it optically inactive.\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate** was identified as achiral due to its planar structure and having both a plane and a center of symmetry, making it optically inactive.\n\nThe analysis correctly concludes that only compounds 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a breakdown of each compound's potential for optical isomerism:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. Biphenyls can exhibit a type of stereoisomerism called atropisomerism when rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is restricted. For this to occur, there must be bulky substituents in the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). In this case, the nitro (-NO2) and dimethyl dicarboxylate (-COOCH3) groups are large enough to hinder free rotation. Because the substitution pattern on the rings is asymmetrical, the molecule is chiral and cannot be superimposed on its mirror image. Therefore, it will show optical isomerism. A related compound, 6,6'-dinitro-2,2'-diphenic acid, is a classic example of an optically active biphenyl.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: This compound, also known as methyl lactate, has a central carbon atom (the second carbon) bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four different substituents is a chiral center. Molecules with a single chiral center are always chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exists as two enantiomers: methyl (R)-2-hydroxypropanoate and methyl (S)-2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The chemical formula for benzophenone is (C6H5)2CO. The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two identical phenyl groups. It does not have a chiral center. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the carbonyl group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. Although the phenyl rings are twisted out of the plane of the carbonyl group, the molecule as a whole is achiral in its ground state and does not exhibit optical isomerism in solution.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The molecule is planar and has a center of inversion, which is a type of symmetry element that precludes chirality. Therefore, it is achiral and does not show optical isomerism. It is a geometric isomer (a type of diastereomer) of dimethyl maleate, but it is not optically active itself.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nProposer: My hypothesis is that compounds 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism, while 3 and 4 do not.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This is a substituted biphenyl. The presence of bulky groups (nitro and dicarboxylate) at all four ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6') should severely restrict rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, can lead to non-superimposable mirror images, which are optically active.\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The second carbon atom is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four different substituents is a chiral center, which is a common cause of optical isomerism.\n3.  **benzophenone**: The structure is (C6H5)2C=O. This molecule has a plane of symmetry that includes the carbonyl group (C=O) and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. Molecules with a plane of symmetry are achiral and therefore not optically active.\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of inversion. Any molecule with a center of inversion is achiral and not optically active.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer should be C. I will perform a search to verify the chirality of these compounds.\n\nSkeptic: The reasoning seems solid, especially for compounds 2, 3, and 4. The identification of the chiral center in methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is straightforward. The arguments based on the plane of symmetry for benzophenone and the center of inversion for dimethyl fumarate are also strong indicators of achirality. The main point to confirm is for compound 1. While ortho-substituted biphenyls are classic examples of atropisomerism, it's crucial to be certain that these specific substituents (nitro and dicarboxylate) are bulky enough to create stable, resolvable enantiomers at room temperature. A search should confirm the existence of atropisomerism in this class of compounds.\n\nDecide: I will execute a search to confirm the optical activity of each of the four compounds, paying special attention to the atropisomerism in dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.Proposer: The search results confirm my initial analysis.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: The search results show that substituted biphenyls with bulky groups at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6') exhibit atropisomerism and are optically active. Specifically, 6,6'-dinitro-2,2'-diphenic acid is a classic example of a resolvable, optically active biphenyl. The compound in question has nitro groups at 6,6' and dicarboxylate groups at 2,2', which are all bulky. This confirms it will show optical isomerism.\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The search results explicitly state that this compound, also known as methyl lactate, is the \"simplest chiral ester\". It exists as separate (R) and (S) enantiomers. This confirms it is optically active.\n3.  **benzophenone**: While individual molecules of benzophenone are achiral, they can crystallize into enantiomorphic solids that show optical activity. However, in solution or as an individual molecule, it is achiral due to symmetry and does not exhibit optical isomerism. The question refers to the properties of the compound itself, not its crystalline form.\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the *trans*-isomer of a butenedioate. The molecule is planar and has a center of inversion, making it achiral. It is a geometric isomer of dimethyl maleate, but it is not optically active.\n\nTherefore, compounds 1 and 2 are the ones that show optical isomerism.\n\nSkeptic: The evidence is compelling. The searches confirm the initial reasoning for all four compounds. The point about benzophenone crystallizing into chiral forms is interesting but irrelevant to the inherent chirality of the molecule itself, which is the focus of the question. The atropisomerism of compound 1 and the chiral center of compound 2 are well-supported. The achiral nature of compounds 3 and 4 is also clearly confirmed. The debate can be concluded.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

This property can arise from a chiral center (typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or from axial chirality, as seen in some substituted biphenyls. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:** This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. The bulky nitro (-NO₂) and dimethyl dicarboxylate (-COOCH₃) groups at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6') of the phenyl rings create significant steric hindrance. This hindrance restricts free rotation around the single bond connecting the two biphenyl rings. Because the substitution pattern lacks a plane of symmetry, the molecule is chiral and exists as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers). This specific type of stereoisomerism is known as atropisomerism. Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** Also known as methyl lactate, this compound has a carbon atom at the second position that is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). A carbon atom attached to four distinct groups is a chiral center. Consequently, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a chiral molecule and exists as two enantiomers, (R)-methyl lactate and (S)-methyl lactate, which are optically active.\n\n3.  **Benzophenone:** The benzophenone molecule consists of a central carbonyl group attached to two phenyl rings. In solution, the phenyl rings can rotate. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the carbonyl group, making it achiral. Although benzophenone can crystallize in a chiral arrangement, the individual molecule itself is not chiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism in solution.\n\n4.  **Dimethyl fumarate:** This is the methyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond with identical substituents on each carbon atom of the double bond. It possesses a center of symmetry and a plane of symmetry, making it an achiral molecule. Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate are the compounds that show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine which of the given organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism, each molecule must be assessed for chirality. A molecule is chiral, and therefore optically active, if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This typically arises from the presence of a chiral center or an axis of chirality.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This compound is a substituted biphenyl. Due to the large size of the nitro (-NO2) and dimethyl dicarboxylate (-COOCH3) groups at the ortho positions (6, 6', 2, and 2'), there is significant steric hindrance that restricts free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, makes the molecule chiral as it lacks a plane of symmetry. Biphenyls with bulky ortho substituents are classic examples of molecules that exhibit this type of optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule contains a carbon atom (at position 2) that is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four different substituents is a chiral center. The presence of this stereocenter means the molecule can exist as two non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers), specifically methyl (R)-lactate and methyl (S)-lactate. Therefore, it is optically active.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The chemical structure of benzophenone is (C6H5)2CO. The central carbonyl carbon is bonded to two phenyl groups and double-bonded to an oxygen atom. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that bisects the C=O bond and the angle between the two phenyl rings. Because it has a plane of symmetry and lacks a chiral center, benzophenone is an achiral molecule and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This molecule is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The molecule is planar and has a center of inversion, which is a point of symmetry. Any molecule with a center of inversion is achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is not optically active.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate are the two compounds that show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nAn organic compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This property is most commonly due to the presence of a chiral center (an atom bonded to four different groups) or due to restricted rotation that creates a chiral axis (atropisomerism). Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:\n    *   This is a substituted biphenyl compound. In biphenyls, if there are bulky substituents at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'), the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is restricted.\n    *   In this molecule, all four ortho positions are substituted with bulky groups: two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH₃) and two nitro groups (-NO₂).\n    *   This steric hindrance prevents the molecule from becoming planar. The two rings are forced into a non-planar, twisted conformation.\n    *   Because the substitution pattern on each ring is asymmetric (e.g., on one ring, you have -COOCH₃ at position 2 and -NO₂ at position 6), the molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is chiral and its mirror image is non-superimposable. This phenomenon is called atropisomerism, a form of axial chirality. The compound will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   To check for chirality, we look for a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group):\n        *   Group 1: -H (hydrogen)\n        *   Group 2: -OH (hydroxyl)\n        *   Group 3: -CH₃ (methyl)\n        *   Group 4: -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)\n    *   Since all four groups attached to this carbon are different, it is a chiral center.\n    *   A molecule with one chiral center is always chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**:\n    *   The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O.

A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is considered chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicator of chirality is the presence of a chiral center (an atom, typically carbon, bonded to four different groups). However, chirality can also arise from other structural features like restricted rotation in certain molecules (axial chirality) or specific planar structures (planar chirality), as long as the molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze each compound for chirality.**\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl system, meaning two benzene rings are connected by a single C-C bond. The name indicates the following substituents:\n    *   Two nitro groups (-NO2) at positions 6 and 6'.\n    *   Two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3) at positions 2 and 2'.\n*   **Careful Point (Atropisomerism):** In biphenyl systems, if there are bulky groups at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6'), the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings is hindered. This steric hindrance can lock the molecule into a twisted, non-planar conformation.\n*   **Analysis:** In this molecule, all four ortho positions are substituted with bulky groups (-NO2 and -COOCH3). This severe steric hindrance prevents the rings from becoming coplanar. The resulting twisted structure lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Therefore, the molecule is chiral and its mirror image is non-superimposable. This phenomenon is known as atropisomerism, a type of axial chirality.\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound shows optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Structure:** This is the methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid (lactic acid). Its chemical structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n*   **Careful Point (Chiral Center):** We need to check for the presence of a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n*   **Analysis:** Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the hydroxyl group). The four groups attached to this carbon are:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center.\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a chiral center makes the molecule chiral. Thus, it exists as a pair of enantiomers and shows optical isomerism.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n*   **Structure:** The chemical name for benzophenone is diphenyl ketone. Its structure is C6H5-C(=O)-C6H5.\n*   **Careful Point (Symmetry):** We need to check for elements of symmetry like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n*   **Analysis:** The molecule consists of a central carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two identical phenyl groups (C6H5). There are no chiral centers. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is an achiral molecule and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans* isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Careful Point (Geometric vs. Optical Isomerism and Symmetry):** This molecule is a geometric isomer (*trans*). We need to determine if it is also optically active. We must check for symmetry elements.\n*   **Analysis:** The molecule is planar. This molecular plane itself acts as a plane of symmetry. Furthermore, it has a center of inversion located at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. The presence of either a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion makes a molecule achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is an achiral molecule and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Step 3: Final Conclusion**\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Compound 1 (dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate) is chiral and shows optical isomerism.\n*   Compound 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) is chiral and shows optical isomerism.\n*   Compound 3 (benzophenone) is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n*   Compound 4 (dimethyl fumarate) is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the correct combination is compounds 1 and 2. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nA compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Let's analyze each compound for chirality.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This is a substituted biphenyl molecule. The two phenyl rings are connected by a single bond. Usually, there is free rotation around this bond. However, in this case, there are large, bulky groups (nitro groups and dimethyl carboxylate groups) at all four *ortho* positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). These bulky groups sterically hinder the rotation around the central single bond, forcing the two rings to be non-coplanar. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, creates a chiral axis, making the molecule chiral and thus optically active.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2. It is bonded to four different groups:\n    *   a hydrogen atom (-H)\n    *   a hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    *   a methyl group (-CH₃)\n    *   a methyl carboxylate group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon is bonded to four different substituents, it is a chiral center (or stereocenter). A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral and therefore optically active.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom, so it is sp² hybridized and cannot be a chiral center. The molecule as a whole is symmetric and superimposable on its mirror image. It is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans* isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon double bond. The molecule is planar and has a center of inversion (a point of symmetry) at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.

The most common feature that leads to chirality is the presence of a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups). However, chirality can also arise from other structural features, such as a chiral axis (in atropisomers and allenes) or a chiral plane. A molecule that has a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is achiral and will not be optically active.\n\n*   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. The two phenyl rings are joined by a single C-C bond.\n    *   Rotation around this central C-C bond is severely restricted due to the presence of bulky substituents at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). The substituents are nitro groups (-NO2) and methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH3).\n    *   This restricted rotation, known as steric hindrance, forces the two phenyl rings to be in different planes (non-coplanar).\n    *   This arrangement creates a chiral axis along the biphenyl bond. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion.\n    *   As a result, the molecule and its mirror image are non-superimposable. This phenomenon is called atropisomerism, a type of axial chirality.\n    *   Therefore, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. This is the methyl ester of lactic acid.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the hydroxyl group).\n    *   This carbon atom is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.

A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    *   Since this carbon is attached to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center (or stereocenter).\n    *   A molecule containing a single chiral center is always chiral.\n    *   Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   The structure is (C6H5)2C=O. It consists of a carbonyl group bonded to two phenyl rings.\n    *   The molecule does not contain any chiral centers.\n    *   The molecule possesses elements of symmetry. For instance, a plane of symmetry can pass through the C=O bond, bisecting the angle between the two phenyl rings.

A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality are the presence of a chiral center or axial chirality (atropisomerism). Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:\n    *   This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. The two phenyl rings are joined by a single C-C bond.\n    *   The positions ortho to this connecting bond (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are all substituted with bulky groups: two nitro groups (-NO₂) and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH₃).\n    *   The steric hindrance caused by these large groups prevents free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This locks the molecule into a specific, non-planar conformation.\n    *   In this twisted conformation, the molecule does not possess a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   A molecule that is chiral due to restricted rotation about a single bond is called an atropisomer. Atropisomers are a type of optical isomer.\n    *   Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   The chemical structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the hydroxyl group). This carbon atom is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.

Here is a summary of the reasoning that leads to the final answer.\n\nOptical isomerism is exhibited by molecules that are chiral, meaning they are non-superimposable on their mirror images. We can assess each compound for chirality:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:** This molecule does not have a chiral carbon. However, it has bulky substituents (nitro and carboxylate groups) at all four ortho-positions to the bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This steric hindrance prevents free rotation around the central C-C single bond, creating a form of axial chirality known as atropisomerism. The molecule and its mirror image are non-superimposable enantiomers. Therefore, it is optically active.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The second carbon atom is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). This makes it a chiral center. The molecule exists as a pair of enantiomers and is therefore optically active.\n\n3.  **benzophenone:** The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the two phenyl rings. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral and cannot be optically active.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate:** This is the trans-isomer of an alkene with the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry. Due to these elements of symmetry, it is achiral and not optically active.\n\nBased on this analysis, only compounds 1 and 2 are optically active.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nOptical isomerism is a property exhibited by chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. Let's analyze each of the given compounds:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:** This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. Due to the presence of bulky substituents (nitro groups and carboxylate groups) at the ortho-positions (2, 2', 6, and 6') of the phenyl rings, the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings is severely restricted. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, leads to a stable chiral conformation. The molecule and its mirror image are non-superimposable, resulting in a pair of enantiomers. Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism. A closely related compound, 6,6'-dinitro-2,2'-diphenic acid, is a classic example of a molecule that is optically active due to this phenomenon.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** This compound, also known as methyl lactate, is the methyl ester of lactic acid. The carbon atom at the second position is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom attached to four different substituents is a chiral center. Molecules with a single chiral center are optically active. Indeed, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exists as two distinct enantiomers: (R)-methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and (S)-methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\n3.  **benzophenone:** The chemical formula for benzophenone is (C₆H₅)₂CO. The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. This molecule does not contain a chiral center. It possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the carbonyl group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image and is therefore achiral. Consequently, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The molecule has a center of symmetry (an inversion center) and a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. While it is a stereoisomer (a geometric isomer or diastereomer of dimethyl maleate), it is not optically active.\n\nBased on the analysis, only dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nTo determine which of the given organic moieties exhibit optical isomerism, we need to identify which molecules are chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common sources of chirality in organic molecules are chiral centers (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) and axial chirality (as seen in some substituted biphenyls).\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. Biphenyls can exhibit a type of chirality called atropisomerism if the rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is restricted. This typically happens when there are large, bulky substituents in the ortho positions (the 2, 2', 6, and 6' positions). In this compound, the nitro groups (-NO2) at the 6 and 6' positions and the dimethyl dicarboxylate groups (-COOCH3) at the 2 and 2' positions are large enough to prevent free rotation. This restricted rotation leads to two stable, non-superimposable mirror-image conformations (enantiomers). Therefore, this compound is optically active.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule has a central carbon atom (the second carbon in the propanoate chain) that is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four different substituents is a chiral center. Molecules with a single chiral center are chiral and therefore optically active (unless they are part of a racemic mixture).\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The central carbon atom in benzophenone is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. To be a chiral center, a carbon must be bonded to four *different* groups. Since this carbon is only bonded to three groups and two of them are identical (phenyl groups), it is not a chiral center. The molecule as a whole is achiral because it has a plane of symmetry and is superimposable on its mirror image. While it can crystallize into chiral solids, the individual molecule is not chiral.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of inversion symmetry, which makes it achiral. It does not have any chiral centers and is superimposable on its mirror image, so it does not show optical isomerism.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate are optically active.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nTo determine which of the given organic moieties show optical isomerism, each compound must be assessed for chirality. A molecule is chiral, and thus optically active, if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This often arises from a chiral center or axial chirality.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. Biphenyls can exhibit a type of stereoisomerism called atropisomerism when there is restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restriction is caused by bulky substituents at the ortho positions (the positions adjacent to the connecting bond). In this specific molecule, the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6') are occupied by large groups: two nitro groups (-NO2) and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3). These bulky groups prevent the two phenyl rings from rotating freely, which can lead to two stable, non-superimposable mirror-image conformations (enantiomers). Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism due to axial chirality.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule has a central carbon atom (the second carbon) bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four different substituents is a chiral center. Molecules with a single chiral center are chiral and optically active, existing as a pair of enantiomers (D and L isomers).\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The chemical formula for benzophenone is (C6H5)2CO. The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two identical phenyl groups. It does not possess a chiral center. While individual molecules can adopt a twisted, non-planar conformation, the molecule as a whole is achiral because it can easily interconvert between mirror-image conformations and possesses planes of symmetry in some conformations. It does not exhibit optical isomerism under normal conditions.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry, which makes it achiral. It does not have any chiral centers and cannot be optically active.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate (1) and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (2) are the compounds that show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nAn analysis of the question and the provided options is as follows:\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\nThe question asks to identify which of the given compounds exhibit optical isomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This property is often due to the presence of a chiral center or other elements of chirality like an axis or a plane of chirality.\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl derivative. The two phenyl rings are linked by a C-C single bond. There are bulky substituents at all four ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). Specifically, methyl carboxylate (-COOCH3) groups are at positions 2 and 2', and nitro (-NO2) groups are at positions 6 and 6'.\n*   **Careful Points:** Biphenyls with bulky substituents at the ortho positions can exhibit a special type of stereoisomerism called **atropisomerism**. This occurs because the steric hindrance from the bulky groups prevents free rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   **Restricted Rotation:** The nitro groups and methyl carboxylate groups are large enough to prevent the two phenyl rings from becoming coplanar. The rotation around the central C-C bond is severely restricted.\n    *   **Chirality Condition:** For an atropisomer to be chiral, the molecule must not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion in its stable, non-planar conformation. This is generally true if each ring is asymmetrically substituted. In this molecule, one ring has a -COOCH3 group at C2 and a -NO2 group at C6. The other ring has a -COOCH3 group at C2' and a -NO2 group at C6'.\n    *   **Symmetry:** Due to the restricted rotation, the rings are twisted relative to each other. In this non-planar conformation, the molecule does not possess a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Therefore, it is chiral and its mirror image is non-superimposable.\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound shows optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Structure:** The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. This is the methyl ester of lactic acid.\n*   **Careful Points:** The most common source of chirality in organic molecules is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n*   **Analysis:** Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group).\n    *   It is bonded to:\n        1.

A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    *   Since all four groups attached to this carbon are different, it is a chiral center.\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral and exists as a pair of enantiomers (R and S forms). Therefore, it shows optical isomerism.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n*   **Structure:** The structure is C6H5-C(=O)-C6H5. It is a ketone with two phenyl groups attached to the carbonyl carbon.\n*   **Careful Points:** We need to check for any elements of chirality.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The central carbonyl carbon is sp2 hybridized and is only bonded to three groups (one oxygen and two phenyl groups). It cannot be a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule possesses elements of symmetry. It has a C2 rotational axis passing through the C=O bond. It also has a plane of symmetry that contains the C=O group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings (assuming a stable, non-planar propeller-like conformation) or the molecular plane if it were planar. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is always achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, where the two ester groups are *trans* to each other across the C=C double bond.\n*   **Careful Points:** This molecule exhibits geometric (cis-trans) isomerism, but the question is about optical isomerism. We need to check for chirality.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The molecule is planar. Any planar molecule is achiral because the plane of the molecule itself acts as a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Alternatively, the molecule has a center of inversion (a point of symmetry) at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. A molecule with a center of inversion is always achiral.\n    *   There are no chiral centers in the molecule.\n*   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Final Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (atropisomerism).\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral center).\n*   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n*   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nTherefore, the compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2.

The presence of large groups (nitro and dimethyl dicarboxylate) in all four ortho-positions (the 2, 2', 6, and 6' positions) creates significant steric hindrance. This restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings forces the rings to be non-coplanar. This arrangement results in a molecule that is not superimposable on its mirror image, a condition known as atropisomerism. Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule contains a carbon atom (at position 2) that is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). A carbon atom with four different substituents is a chiral center. Molecules containing a single chiral center are chiral and thus optically active.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The chemical formula for benzophenone is (C₆H₅)₂CO. The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. Since it is not bonded to four different groups, it is not a chiral center. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry and is therefore achiral, meaning it does not exhibit optical isomerism in solution.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This compound is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The molecule is planar and has a center of symmetry, which makes it achiral. Consequently, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate are the compounds that show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe code successfully analyzed four organic compounds for optical isomerism.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate** was identified as having optical isomerism due to atropisomerism, a form of axial chirality caused by restricted rotation around the central single bond.\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** was identified as having optical isomerism because it contains a chiral carbon atom bonded to four distinct groups.\n3.  **benzophenone** was identified as achiral because it possesses a plane of symmetry, making it optically inactive.\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate** was identified as achiral due to its planar structure and having both a plane and a center of symmetry, making it optically inactive.\n\nThe analysis correctly concludes that only compounds 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a breakdown of each compound's potential for optical isomerism:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. Biphenyls can exhibit a type of stereoisomerism called atropisomerism when rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is restricted. For this to occur, there must be bulky substituents in the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). In this case, the nitro (-NO2) and dimethyl dicarboxylate (-COOCH3) groups are large enough to hinder free rotation. Because the substitution pattern on the rings is asymmetrical, the molecule is chiral and cannot be superimposed on its mirror image. Therefore, it will show optical isomerism. A related compound, 6,6'-dinitro-2,2'-diphenic acid, is a classic example of an optically active biphenyl.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: This compound, also known as methyl lactate, has a central carbon atom (the second carbon) bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four different substituents is a chiral center. Molecules with a single chiral center are always chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exists as two enantiomers: methyl (R)-2-hydroxypropanoate and methyl (S)-2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The chemical formula for benzophenone is (C6H5)2CO. The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two identical phenyl groups. It does not have a chiral center. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the carbonyl group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. Although the phenyl rings are twisted out of the plane of the carbonyl group, the molecule as a whole is achiral in its ground state and does not exhibit optical isomerism in solution.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The molecule is planar and has a center of inversion, which is a type of symmetry element that precludes chirality. Therefore, it is achiral and does not show optical isomerism. It is a geometric isomer (a type of diastereomer) of dimethyl maleate, but it is not optically active itself.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nProposer: My hypothesis is that compounds 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism, while 3 and 4 do not.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This is a substituted biphenyl. The presence of bulky groups (nitro and dicarboxylate) at all four ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6') should severely restrict rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, can lead to non-superimposable mirror images, which are optically active.\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The second carbon atom is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four different substituents is a chiral center, which is a common cause of optical isomerism.\n3.  **benzophenone**: The structure is (C6H5)2C=O. This molecule has a plane of symmetry that includes the carbonyl group (C=O) and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. Molecules with a plane of symmetry are achiral and therefore not optically active.\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of inversion. Any molecule with a center of inversion is achiral and not optically active.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer should be C. I will perform a search to verify the chirality of these compounds.\n\nSkeptic: The reasoning seems solid, especially for compounds 2, 3, and 4. The identification of the chiral center in methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is straightforward. The arguments based on the plane of symmetry for benzophenone and the center of inversion for dimethyl fumarate are also strong indicators of achirality. The main point to confirm is for compound 1. While ortho-substituted biphenyls are classic examples of atropisomerism, it's crucial to be certain that these specific substituents (nitro and dicarboxylate) are bulky enough to create stable, resolvable enantiomers at room temperature. A search should confirm the existence of atropisomerism in this class of compounds.\n\nDecide: I will execute a search to confirm the optical activity of each of the four compounds, paying special attention to the atropisomerism in dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.Proposer: The search results confirm my initial analysis.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: The search results show that substituted biphenyls with bulky groups at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6') exhibit atropisomerism and are optically active. Specifically, 6,6'-dinitro-2,2'-diphenic acid is a classic example of a resolvable, optically active biphenyl. The compound in question has nitro groups at 6,6' and dicarboxylate groups at 2,2', which are all bulky. This confirms it will show optical isomerism.\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The search results explicitly state that this compound, also known as methyl lactate, is the \"simplest chiral ester\". It exists as separate (R) and (S) enantiomers. This confirms it is optically active.\n3.  **benzophenone**: While individual molecules of benzophenone are achiral, they can crystallize into enantiomorphic solids that show optical activity. However, in solution or as an individual molecule, it is achiral due to symmetry and does not exhibit optical isomerism. The question refers to the properties of the compound itself, not its crystalline form.\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the *trans*-isomer of a butenedioate. The molecule is planar and has a center of inversion, making it achiral. It is a geometric isomer of dimethyl maleate, but it is not optically active.\n\nTherefore, compounds 1 and 2 are the ones that show optical isomerism.\n\nSkeptic: The evidence is compelling. The searches confirm the initial reasoning for all four compounds. The point about benzophenone crystallizing into chiral forms is interesting but irrelevant to the inherent chirality of the molecule itself, which is the focus of the question. The atropisomerism of compound 1 and the chiral center of compound 2 are well-supported. The achiral nature of compounds 3 and 4 is also clearly confirmed. The debate can be concluded.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
