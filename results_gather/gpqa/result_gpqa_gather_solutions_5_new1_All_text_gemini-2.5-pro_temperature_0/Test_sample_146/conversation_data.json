Understand the Initial State and Apply Conservation of Energy**\n\nThe problem describes the annihilation of a proton ($p$) and a slowly moving antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). The term \"slowly moving\" implies that the kinetic energy of the antiproton is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. We can assume the proton is also at rest (as in a fixed-target experiment). Therefore, the total initial energy of the system is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n\nThe rest mass energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938 \\text{ MeV}$.\nThe rest mass energy of an antiproton is the same, $m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 \\approx 938 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\nTotal initial energy ($E_{initial}$):\n$E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 938 \\text{ MeV} + 938 \\text{ MeV} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**2. Understand the Final State and Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n\nThe initial system is effectively at rest, so the total initial momentum is zero. By the law of conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the final particles must also be zero.\n\nThe final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. Since they all have the same mass ($m_A$) and the total momentum is zero, the total energy must be distributed equally among them for the system to be symmetric.\n\n**3. Calculate the Energy of a Single Particle A**\n\nThe total final energy ($E_{final}$) must be equal to the total initial energy.\n$E_{final} = E_{initial} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$\n\nThis total energy is shared among the four final particles. The energy of a single particle A ($E_A$) is:\n$E_A = \\frac{E_{final}}{4} = \\frac{1876 \\text{ MeV}}{4} = 469 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**4. Calculate the Velocity of Particle A**\n\nWe now know the total energy ($E_A$) and the rest mass energy ($m_A c^2$) of a single particle A. We can use the relativistic energy equation to find its velocity.\n\nThe relativistic energy equation is $E = \\gamma m c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\nWe have:\n*   $E_A = 469 \\text{ MeV}$\n*   $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$\n\nFirst, calculate the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469 \\text{ MeV}}{300 \\text{ MeV}} \\approx 1.5633$\n\nNow, solve for the velocity $v$. Let $\\beta = v/c$.\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n$1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nSubstitute the value of $\\gamma$:\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5633)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.444}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4091} = \\sqrt{0.5909}$\n$\\beta \\approx 0.7687$\n\nSo, the velocity of particle A is $v \\approx 0.77c$.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThe initial calculation seems correct. I will refine it with a more precise value for the proton's rest mass energy and then finalize the answer.\n\n1.  **Initial State & Energy Conservation**: The process is a proton-antiproton annihilation. The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which implies its kinetic energy is negligible. We can assume the annihilation happens at rest. In this scenario, the total initial energy is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n    *   The rest mass of a proton ($m_p$) is equal to the rest mass of an antiproton ($m_{\\bar{p}}$).\n    *   The rest energy of a proton is approximately 938.27 MeV. Some sources round this to 938 MeV or 939.3 MeV. I will use 938.27 MeV for better precision.\n    *   Total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) = $E_p + E_{\\bar{p}} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times 938.27 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.54 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n2.  **Final State & Energy Distribution**: The annihilation produces four particles of mass $m_A$, where $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   According to the principle of conservation of energy, the total initial energy is converted into the total energy of the final particles.\n    *   $E_{initial} = E_{final} = 1876.54 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   Due to the conservation of momentum (initial momentum is zero), the energy will be distributed equally among the four resulting particles.\n    *   Energy per particle A ($E_A$) = $E_{final} / 4 = 1876.54 \\text{ MeV} / 4 = 469.135 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n3.  **Relativistic Velocity Calculation**: Each particle A has a total energy $E_A = 469.135 \\text{ MeV}$ and a rest energy $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$. We can find its velocity using the relativistic energy-momentum relation.\n    *   The total energy of a particle is given by $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = 1 / \\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}$.\n    *   $\\gamma = E_A / (m_A c^2) = 469.135 \\text{ MeV} / 300 \\text{ MeV} \\approx 1.56378$.\n    *   Now, we solve for the velocity, $v$.\n        *   $\\gamma^2 = 1 / (1 - v^2/c^2)$\n        *   $1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 / \\gamma^2$\n        *   $v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1 / \\gamma^2$\n        *   $v = c \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$\n    *   Plugging in the value for $\\gamma$:\n        *   $v = c \\sqrt{1 - 1/(1.56378)^2}$\n        *   $v = c \\sqrt{1 - 1/2.44558}$\n        *   $v = c \\sqrt{1 - 0.40890}$\n        *   $v = c \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n        *   $v \\approx 0.7688c$\n\n4.  **Conclusion**: The calculated velocity is approximately $0.77c$. This matches option B.\n\nFinal check of the steps and reasoning.\n- The assumption of annihilation at rest is justified by the \"slowly moving\" antiproton.\n- Conservation of energy is correctly applied.\n- Equal energy distribution among the four identical product particles is justified by momentum conservation in the center-of-mass frame.\n- The relativistic energy formula is correctly used to find the velocity.\nThe calculation is robust.\n\nFinal Answer is B.\nThe problem describes a proton-antiproton annihilation at rest, producing four particles.\n\n1.  **Calculate the total initial energy.**\n    The process begins with a proton and a \"slowly moving\" antiproton. This implies we can consider them both to be effectively at rest, so their initial kinetic energy is negligible. The total initial energy is the sum of their rest energies. The rest energy of a proton is approximately 938.27 MeV. An antiproton has the same rest mass.\n    *   Total Initial Energy ($E_{initial}$) = $2 \\times (\\text{rest energy of a proton})$\n    *   $E_{initial} = 2 \\times 938.27 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.54 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n2.  **Determine the energy of each final particle.**\n    The annihilation results in four particles ($2A^+$ and $2A^-$). By the law of conservation of energy, the total initial energy is distributed among these four particles. Since the initial momentum is zero, the energy is shared equally.\n    *   Energy per particle A ($E_A$) = $E_{initial} / 4$\n    *   $E_A = 1876.54 \\text{ MeV} / 4 = 469.135 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the velocity of particle A.**\n    The total energy ($E_A$) of each particle A is the sum of its rest energy ($m_A c^2$) and its kinetic energy. The relationship is given by the relativistic formula $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   We are given $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   The Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ is $E_A / (m_A c^2) = 469.135 \\text{ MeV} / 300 \\text{ MeV} \\approx 1.564$.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is also defined as $\\gamma = 1 / \\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}$. We can solve for the velocity $v$.\n    *   $\\gamma^2 = 1 / (1 - v^2/c^2)$\n    *   $v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/\\gamma^2$\n    *   $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - 1/(1.564)^2} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 1/2.446} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.4088} \\approx \\sqrt{0.5912} \\approx 0.769$.\n    *   Therefore, the velocity of particle A is approximately $0.77c$.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0.96c\nB) 0.77c\nC) 0.91c\nD) 0.86c\n\nThe calculated velocity matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing principle:** The core principle is the conservation of energy. The total energy before the annihilation must equal the total energy after the annihilation.\n2.  **Calculate the initial energy ($E_{initial}$):** The initial state consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which implies its kinetic energy is negligible. We can assume both particles are effectively at rest. Therefore, the total initial energy is the sum of their rest mass energies. The rest mass energy of a proton is approximately 938.27 MeV, and an antiproton has the same rest mass.\n3.  **Calculate the final energy ($E_{final}$):** The final state consists of four particles (two $A^+$ and two $A^-$). The total final energy is the sum of the energies of these four particles. By symmetry, each of these four particles will have the same energy, which we'll call $E_A$. So, $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A$.\n4.  **Equate initial and final energies:** From the conservation of energy, $E_{initial} = E_{final}$. This allows us to solve for the energy of a single particle A, $E_A$.\n5.  **Relate energy to velocity:** The total energy of a relativistic particle is given by $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor and $m_A c^2$ is the rest mass energy of particle A (given as 300 MeV). We can use this to calculate $\\gamma$.\n6.  **Solve for velocity:** The Lorentz factor is defined as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$.

In any such interaction, both total energy and total momentum must be conserved. Since the final particles are expected to be moving at high speeds, we must use the principles of special relativity.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Initial State (Before Annihilation):**\n    *   The initial particles are a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    *   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". This is a key phrase indicating that its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. We can therefore approximate it as being at rest.\n    *   In a typical fixed-target experiment, the proton would be part of a stationary target. Thus, we can assume the proton is also at rest.\n    *   With both initial particles effectively at rest, the total initial momentum of the system is zero ($\\vec{P}_{initial} \\approx 0$). This means the annihilation occurs in the center-of-mass frame.\n    *   The total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n    *   The rest energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   A particle and its antiparticle have the same mass, so $m_{\\bar{p}} = m_p$.\n    *   Therefore, $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 m_p c^2$.\n    *   $E_{initial} \\approx 2 \\times 938 \\text{ MeV} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Final State (After Annihilation):**\n    *   The final state consists of four particles: $2A^+ + 2A^-$.\n    *   We are given that the rest energy of particle A is $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$. We assume the antiparticle $A^-$ has the same mass as the particle $A^+$.\n    *   By the conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero ($\\vec{P}_{final} = 0$).\n    *   For the total momentum to be zero, the four final particles must fly off in directions such that their vector momenta cancel out.\n    *   Since the system is in the center-of-mass frame and the four final particles have identical masses, the available energy will be distributed equally among them. This means each of the four A particles will have the same speed, $v_A$, and thus the same total energy, $E_A$.\n    *   The total energy of a single relativistic particle is $E_A = \\gamma_A m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma_A = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v_A/c)^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The total final energy is the sum of the energies of the four A particles: $E_{final} = 4 E_A = 4 \\gamma_A m_A c^2$.\n\n4.  **Apply the Law of Conservation of Energy:**\n    We equate the total initial energy and the total final energy:\n    $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    $2 m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma_A m_A c^2$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Velocity of Particle A ($v_A$):**\n    *   First, we solve the energy equation for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_A$:\n        $\\gamma_A = \\frac{2 m_p c^2}{4 m_A c^2} = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 m_A c^2}$\n    *   Now, substitute the known values for the rest energies:\n        $\\gamma_A = \\frac{938 \\text{ MeV}}{2 \\times 300 \\text{ MeV}} = \\frac{938}{600} \\approx 1.5633$\n    *   Next, we use the definition of the Lorentz factor to find the velocity. Let $\\beta = v_A/c$.\n        $\\gamma_A = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n    *   Rearrange the formula to solve for $\\beta$:\n        $\\gamma_A^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2} \\implies 1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma_A^2} \\implies \\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_A^2}$\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_A^2}}$\n    *   Substitute the calculated value of $\\gamma_A$:\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5633)^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.444}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.4091}$\n        $\\beta \\approx \\sqrt{0.5909} \\approx 0.7687$\n    *   The velocity of particle A is $v_A = \\beta c \\approx 0.77c$.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated velocity is approximately 0.77c, which corresponds to option D.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **\"Slowly moving\" approximation:** It is critical to interpret this as meaning the initial kinetic energy is negligible, simplifying the initial state to a system at rest.\n*   **Relativistic kinematics:** The energies involved ($m_p c^2 \\gg m_A c^2$) and the resulting speeds require the use of relativistic formulas for energy ($E=\\gamma mc^2$), not classical ones ($E=mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$).\n*   **Symmetry:** The symmetry of the initial state (at rest) and the final state (four identical-mass particles) allows for the simple assumption that energy is distributed equally.\n*   **Constants:** Using the standard value for the proton's rest energy ($m_p c^2 \\approx 938$ MeV) is necessary.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is the step-by-step solution:\n\n**1.

Principle of Conservation of Energy\n\nThe process is the annihilation of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) into four new particles ($2A^{+} + 2A^{-}$). According to the principle of conservation of energy, the total energy before the annihilation must equal the total energy after the annihilation.\n\n### 2. Initial Energy\n\n*   The problem states that the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which implies its kinetic energy is negligible.

Using a more precise value won't significantly change the result to match another option, but let's recalculate with 938.27 MeV.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the principles of conservation of energy and momentum, which are fundamental in particle annihilation processes.\n\n**Detailed Steps:**\n\n1.  **Identify Initial State:**\n    *   One proton ($p$) and one antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    *   The antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which implies its kinetic energy is negligible. To conserve momentum (initially near zero), the proton must also be nearly at rest.

The most straightforward way for this to happen is if they share the available energy equally. Therefore, each of the four particles will have the same total energy, $E_A$.\n    *   The total final energy is $E_f = 4 \\times E_A$.\n\n3.  **Apply Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   $E_i = E_f$\n    *   $1876.54 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\times E_A$\n    *   $E_A = \\frac{1876.54}{4} \\text{ MeV} = 469.135 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Velocity:**\n    *   The total energy of a single particle A is given by the relativistic formula $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   We know $E_A = 469.135$ MeV and $m_A c^2 = 300$ MeV.\n    *   $469.135 = \\gamma \\times 300$\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{469.135}{300} \\approx 1.56378$\n\n5.  **Convert Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$) to Velocity (v):**\n    *   The Lorentz factor is defined as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$. Let $\\beta = v/c$.\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n    *   $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n    *   $1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    *   $\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    *   $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    *   $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.56378)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.44541}}$\n    *   $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - 0.40892} = \\sqrt{0.59108}$\n    *   $\\beta \\approx 0.7688$\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The velocity of particle A is $v = \\beta c \\approx 0.77c$.\n    *   This corresponds to option D.\n\nThe calculation is robust.

Principle of Conservation of Energy**\n\nThe fundamental principle we will use is the conservation of total energy. The total energy of the system before the annihilation must be equal to the total energy of the system after the annihilation. We will also implicitly use the conservation of momentum.\n\n**2. Initial State Energy ($E_{initial}$)**\n\n*   The initial state consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n*   The problem states that the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". This is a common simplification in such problems, implying that the kinetic energies of the initial particles are negligible compared to their rest mass energies. To satisfy the conservation of momentum (initial momentum must be zero), we analyze the event in the center-of-mass frame, where both the proton and antiproton are effectively at rest.\n*   The total initial energy is therefore the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n*   The rest energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) is approximately 938.3 MeV. The antiproton has the same rest energy.\n*   Therefore, the total initial energy is:\n    $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2$\n    $E_{initial} = 2 \\times 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**3. Final State Energy ($E_{final}$)**\n\n*   The final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$.\n*   We assume that $A^+$ and $A^-$ have the same mass, $m_A$. The problem gives the rest energy of particle A as $m_A c^2 = 300$ MeV.\n*   Since the initial total momentum is zero, the total momentum of the four final particles must also be zero. By symmetry, the total energy released ($E_{initial}$) will be distributed equally among the four final particles. Each particle will have the same speed and thus the same total energy, which we'll call $E_A$.\n*   The total final energy is the sum of the energies of the four A particles:\n    $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A$\n\n**4. Equating Initial and Final Energy**\n\n*   According to the conservation of energy:\n    $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    $1876.6 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\times E_A$\n*   We can now find the total energy of a single particle A:\n    $E_A = \\frac{1876.6 \\text{ MeV}}{4} = 469.15 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**5. Calculating the Velocity**\n\n*   The total energy ($E_A$) of a relativistic particle is related to its rest energy ($m_A c^2$) and its velocity ($v$) by the formula:\n    $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$\n    where $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$.\n*   We can first calculate the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469.15 \\text{ MeV}}{300 \\text{ MeV}} \\approx 1.5638$\n*   Now, we solve for the velocity $v$. Let $\\beta = v/c$:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n    $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n    $1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n*   Plugging in the value of $\\gamma$:\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911} \\approx 0.7688$\n\nThe velocity of particle A is approximately $0.77c$.

Identify the Physical Principles**\n\nThe core principles governing this particle annihilation process are the conservation of energy and the conservation of momentum. Since the resulting particles will be moving at speeds close to the speed of light, we must use relativistic formulas for energy and momentum.\n\n**2. Analyze the Initial State**\n\n*   The initial system consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n*   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". In the context of annihilation, where the energy released from converting mass is enormous, the initial kinetic energy of the particles is negligible compared to their rest mass energy. Therefore, we can assume both the proton and antiproton are effectively at rest.\n*   The total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and antiproton.\n    *   Rest mass energy of a proton, $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.27 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n    *   An antiproton has the same mass as a proton, so $m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = m_p c^2$.\n    *   $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2 = 2 \\times 938.27 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1876.54 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n*   Since the particles are considered to be at rest, the total initial momentum ($P_{initial}$) is zero.\n\n**3. Analyze the Final State**\n\n*   The final system consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. All these particles have the same rest mass, $m_A$.\n*   The rest mass energy of each particle A is given as $m_A c^2 = 300 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n*   By the conservation of momentum, the total final momentum ($P_{final}$) must also be zero. This implies that the four particles fly off in such a way that their momentum vectors cancel out.\n*   Due to the symmetry of the final state (four identical mass particles), we can conclude that they will all have the same speed, $v_A$, and therefore the same total energy, $E_A$.\n*   The total energy of a single relativistic particle is given by $E_A = \\gamma_A m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma_A$ is the Lorentz factor, defined as $\\gamma_A = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v_A/c)^2}}$.\n*   The total final energy ($E_{final}$) is the sum of the energies of the four A particles:\n    *   $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma_A m_A c^2$.\n\n**4.

Initial Energy**\nThe initial state consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). The problem states that the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which implies that the initial kinetic energy of the system is negligible compared to the rest mass energy. Therefore, the total initial energy ($E_i$) is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton. Since a proton and an antiproton have the same mass, this is twice the rest energy of a proton.\n\n$E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 m_p c^2$\n\nThe rest energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) is approximately 938.27 MeV.\n\n$E_i = 2 \\times 938.27 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1876.54 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\n**2. Final Energy**\nThe final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. Since they are produced from the annihilation, they will share the total initial energy. By conservation of momentum, if the initial system was at rest, the final particles must move in such a way that the total momentum remains zero. This implies that all four resulting particles will have the same speed, $v$, and therefore the same energy.\n\nThe energy of a single relativistic particle ($E_A$) is given by:\n\n$E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\nwhere $m_A c^2$ is the rest energy of particle A (given as 300 MeV) and $\\gamma$ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$\n\nThe total final energy ($E_f$) is the sum of the energies of the four A particles:\n\n$E_f = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n**3.

Understand the Initial State and Apply Conservation of Energy**\n\nThe problem describes the annihilation of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). The antiproton is said to be \"slowly moving,\" which implies its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. We can assume the proton is a stationary target. Therefore, the total initial momentum of the system is effectively zero, and the total initial energy is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n\nThe rest mass energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.3 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\nSince a particle and its antiparticle have the same mass, $m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = m_p c^2$.\n\nThe total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) is:\n$E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2$\n$E_{initial} = 2 \\times 938.3 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1876.6 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\nAccording to the law of conservation of energy, this total initial energy must be equal to the total final energy ($E_{final}$) of the products.\n$E_{final} = 1876.6 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\n**2. Analyze the Final State**\n\nThe annihilation produces four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$.

Distribute the Energy Among the Products**\n\nThe initial total momentum was zero. By the law of conservation of momentum, the final total momentum must also be zero. Since the four resulting particles have identical masses, for the total momentum to be zero, the total energy must be distributed equally among them.\n\nTherefore, the energy of a single particle A ($E_A$) is one-fourth of the total final energy:\n$E_A = \\frac{E_{final}}{4} = \\frac{1876.6 \\, \\text{MeV}}{4} = 469.15 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\n**4.

Initial State Analysis**\n*   The problem states that the antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) is \"slowly moving.\" This implies its kinetic energy is negligible. We can assume both the proton ($p$) and the antiproton are effectively at rest.\n*   The total initial energy ($E_i$) is therefore the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton. Since a particle and its antiparticle have the same mass, this is twice the rest energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$).\n*   The rest energy of a proton is approximately 938 MeV.\n*   Therefore, the total initial energy is $E_i = 2 \\times m_p c^2 \\approx 2 \\times 938 \\text{ MeV} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   Since the particles are at rest, the total initial momentum is zero.\n\n**2.

To achieve this, the four resulting particles must move away from the annihilation point with speeds that are equal in magnitude.\n*   The total final energy ($E_f$) is the sum of the relativistic energies of the four A particles. The relativistic energy of a single particle is $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n*   Therefore, the total final energy is $E_f = 4 \\times (\\gamma m_A c^2)$.\n\n**3.

Since momentum is conserved, the energy will be distributed equally among the four identical particles. The total energy of a single particle A is given by the relativistic formula $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = 1 / \\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}$. So, the total final energy is $E_f = 4 E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$.\n    *   Equating the initial and final energies:\n        $E_i = E_f$\n        $2 m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n5.  **Solve for the velocity:**\n    *   First, we can simplify the energy conservation equation:\n        $m_p c^2 = 2 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n    *   Now, we solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 m_A c^2}$\n    *   We are given $m_A c^2 = 300 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n    *   The rest energy of a proton, $m_p c^2$, is approximately 938.3 MeV.\n    *   Substitute these values into the equation for $\\gamma$:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{938.3 \\, \\text{MeV}}{2 \\times 300 \\, \\text{MeV}} = \\frac{938.3}{600} \\approx 1.564$\n    *   Now, use the definition of the Lorentz factor to solve for the velocity ($v$).

Therefore, the initial kinetic energy is negligible, and the total initial energy is the sum of the rest energies of the proton ($p$) and the antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    The rest energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.27$ MeV. An antiproton has the exact same mass.\n    $E_i = E_{rest, p} + E_{rest, \\bar{p}} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2$\n    $E_i = 2 \\times 938.27 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.54 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n2.  **Final State Energy ($E_f$):**\n    The final state consists of four particles: two $A^{+}$ and two $A^{-}$. Since $A^{+}$ and $A^{-}$ are a particle-antiparticle pair, they have the same mass, $m_A$. The problem gives the rest energy as $m_A c^2 = 300$ MeV.\n    The total final energy is the sum of the total energies of these four particles.\n    $E_f = E_{A_1} + E_{A_2} + E_{A_3} + E_{A_4}$\n\n3.  **Conservation of Momentum and Energy Distribution:**\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial system is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero ($P_i = 0$). By conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero ($P_f = 0$). This means the four final particles must fly off in directions such that their vector momenta sum to zero.\n    *   **Energy Distribution:** Due to the symmetry of the final state (four particles of identical mass) and the requirement of zero total momentum, the total energy released from the annihilation will be distributed equally among the four particles.\n    *   Therefore, the total energy of each particle A ($E_A$) is one-fourth of the total initial energy.\n\n4.  **Energy of a Single Particle A:**\n    From the conservation of energy, $E_i = E_f$.\n    $1876.54 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\times E_A$\n    $E_A = \\frac{1876.54 \\text{ MeV}}{4} = 469.135 \\text{ MeV}$\n    This value, $E_A$, represents the total energy (rest energy + kinetic energy) of a single particle A.\n\n5.  **Calculating Velocity from Energy:**\n    The total energy of a relativistic particle is given by the formula $E = \\gamma m c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, defined as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$.\n    *   We can first find the Lorentz factor for particle A:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469.135 \\text{ MeV}}{300 \\text{ MeV}} \\approx 1.5638$\n    *   Now, we solve for the velocity, $v$.\n        $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n        $1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n        $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n        $v/c \\approx 0.7688$\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The velocity of particle A is approximately 0.77 times the speed of light ($0.77c$). This matches option C.

The question asks for \"the velocity of particle A,\" implying all four final particles have the same speed ($v$). This symmetric outcome is the most straightforward way to conserve both energy and momentum. The total available energy will be distributed equally among the four particles.\n    *   The total energy of a single A particle is $E_A$. The total final energy is $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A$.\n\n5.  **Apply Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   Set the initial energy equal to the final energy: $E_{initial} = E_{final}$.\n    *   $1876 \\, \\text{MeV} = 4 \\times E_A$.\n    *   Solve for the energy of a single particle A:\n        $E_A = \\frac{1876 \\, \\text{MeV}}{4} = 469 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the velocity:**\n    *   The total energy of a relativistic particle is given by $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   We can now solve for $\\gamma$:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469 \\, \\text{MeV}}{300 \\, \\text{MeV}} \\approx 1.5633$.\n    *   Now, we solve for the velocity $v$ from the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$.

The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which in particle physics contexts implies its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. For simplicity and to conserve momentum, we can assume both particles are effectively at rest before annihilation. This is known as annihilation at rest.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum**:\n    *   Since the proton and antiproton are at rest, the total initial momentum of the system is zero.\n    *   By the law of conservation of momentum, the total final momentum of the four product particles ($2A^+$ and $2A^-$) must also be zero.\n\n3.  **Conservation of Energy**:\n    *   **Initial Energy ($E_i$)**: The total initial energy is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton. The rest mass of a proton ($m_p$) is the same as that of an antiproton, which is approximately $m_p c^2 = 938.3 \\text{ MeV}$.\n        $E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2 = 2 \\times 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n    *   **Final Energy ($E_f$)**: The final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. The problem gives the rest energy of particle A as $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$. Due to the conservation of momentum (total final momentum is zero) and the fact that the resulting particles have the same mass, the total energy released will be distributed equally among the four particles.

The antiproton is \"slowly moving.\" This is a key phrase. In particle physics, \"slowly moving\" or \"at rest\" usually implies that the initial kinetic energy is negligible compared to the rest mass energy. So, we can assume the center-of-mass frame is the lab frame, and the total initial momentum is zero.\n    *   **Final State:** Four particles, two $A^+$ and two $A^-$.\n    *   **Known Values:**\n        *   Rest mass energy of particle A, $m_A c^2 = 300 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n        *   The rest mass energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) and an antiproton ($m_{\\bar{p}} c^2$) is a standard value I should know or look up.

This process converts their mass entirely into other forms of energy, which in this case are the rest mass and kinetic energy of four new particles: two $A^{+}$ and two $A^{-}$.\n    The reaction is: $p + \\bar{p} \\rightarrow 2A^{+} + 2A^{-}$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Initial State and Identify Key Information:**\n    *   **Particles:** A proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    *   **Mass of Proton/Antiproton:** The rest mass energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.3 \\text{ MeV}$. An antiproton has the exact same mass, so $m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = m_p c^2$.\n    *   **Initial Motion:** The antiproton is \"slowly moving\". This is a critical phrase in particle physics problems. It implies that its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. For this type of symmetric annihilation, it's standard to assume the process happens \"at rest\" in the center-of-mass frame. This means the total initial momentum is zero, and the total initial kinetic energy is also approximately zero.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Final State:**\n    *   **Particles:** Four particles are produced: two $A^{+}$ and two $A^{-}$. Since $A^{+}$ and $A^{-}$ are antiparticles of each other, they must have the same mass, $m_A$.\n    *   **Mass of Particle A:** We are given that the rest mass energy of particle A is $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n4.  **Apply Conservation Laws:**\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the reaction must equal the total energy after the reaction.\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the reaction must equal the total momentum after the reaction.\n\n5.  **Careful Points and Assumptions:**\n    *   **Initial Energy:** Based on the \"slowly moving\" assumption, we take the initial kinetic energy of the system to be zero. Therefore, the total initial energy is purely the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and antiproton.\n    *   **Final State Energy & Momentum Distribution:** The initial momentum is zero. By conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the four final particles must also be zero. The question asks for \"the velocity\" of particle A, implying a single, unique value. This strongly suggests a symmetric decay where the available kinetic energy is distributed equally among the four final particles. This means all four particles will have the same speed.\n    *   **Relativistic Mechanics:** The energies involved (hundreds of MeV) are comparable to the rest mass energies of the particles. Therefore, we must use the principles of special relativity, specifically the formulas for relativistic energy and momentum. Using classical mechanics ($K = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$) would give an incorrect result.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total initial energy ($E_{initial}$)**\nSince the proton and antiproton are considered to be at rest, their energy is their rest mass energy.\n$E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2$\n$E_{initial} = 938.3 \\text{ MeV} + 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**Step 2: Apply Conservation of Energy to find the total final energy ($E_{final}$)**\nAccording to the law of conservation of energy, $E_{final} = E_{initial}$.\n$E_{final} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$\nThis total final energy is shared among the four A particles.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the energy of a single final particle A ($E_A$)**\nDue to the symmetry of the final state (four particles of equal mass), we can assume the total energy is distributed equally among them.\n$E_A = \\frac{E_{final}}{4} = \\frac{1876.6 \\text{ MeV}}{4} = 469.15 \\text{ MeV}$\nThis is the total energy (rest mass energy + kinetic energy) of one particle A.\n\n**Step 4: Use the relativistic energy formula to find the velocity ($v$)**\nThe total relativistic energy of a particle is given by $E = \\gamma m c^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\nWe have:\n*   Total energy of one particle A: $E_A = 469.15 \\text{ MeV}$\n*   Rest mass energy of one particle A: $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$\n\nNow, we can find the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469.15 \\text{ MeV}}{300 \\text{ MeV}} \\approx 1.5638$\n\nFinally, we solve for the velocity $v$.

Final State Energy ($E_{final}$)**\n\n*   The final state consists of four particles: two $A^{+}$ and two $A^{-}$. Since they are produced as a result of the annihilation and the initial momentum is zero, the total final momentum must also be zero. For momentum to be conserved, the energy must be distributed equally among the four identical-mass particles, meaning they will all have the same speed, $v_A$, and thus the same energy, $E_A$.\n*   The total energy of a single relativistic particle is given by $E = \\gamma m c^2$, where $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is $1/\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}$.\n*   The rest energy of particle A is given as $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   The total final energy is the sum of the energies of the four A particles:\n    $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\times \\gamma_A m_A c^2$.\n\n**4.

The core physical principles governing this process are the **conservation of energy** and the **conservation of momentum**.

Understand the Initial State and Apply Conservation of Energy**\n\nThe problem describes the annihilation of a proton ($p$) and a slowly moving antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). The term \"slowly moving\" implies that the kinetic energy of the antiproton is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. We can assume the proton is also at rest (as in a fixed-target experiment). Therefore, the total initial energy of the system is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n\nThe rest mass energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938 \\text{ MeV}$.\nThe rest mass energy of an antiproton is the same, $m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 \\approx 938 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\nTotal initial energy ($E_{initial}$):\n$E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 938 \\text{ MeV} + 938 \\text{ MeV} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**2. Understand the Final State and Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n\nThe initial system is effectively at rest, so the total initial momentum is zero. By the law of conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the final particles must also be zero.\n\nThe final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. Since they all have the same mass ($m_A$) and the total momentum is zero, the total energy must be distributed equally among them for the system to be symmetric.\n\n**3. Calculate the Energy of a Single Particle A**\n\nThe total final energy ($E_{final}$) must be equal to the total initial energy.\n$E_{final} = E_{initial} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$\n\nThis total energy is shared among the four final particles. The energy of a single particle A ($E_A$) is:\n$E_A = \\frac{E_{final}}{4} = \\frac{1876 \\text{ MeV}}{4} = 469 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**4. Calculate the Velocity of Particle A**\n\nWe now know the total energy ($E_A$) and the rest mass energy ($m_A c^2$) of a single particle A.

Let $\\beta = v/c$.\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n$1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nSubstitute the value of $\\gamma$:\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5633)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.444}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4091} = \\sqrt{0.5909}$\n$\\beta \\approx 0.7687$\n\nSo, the velocity of particle A is $v \\approx 0.77c$.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThe initial calculation seems correct. I will refine it with a more precise value for the proton's rest mass energy and then finalize the answer.\n\n1.  **Initial State & Energy Conservation**: The process is a proton-antiproton annihilation. The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which implies its kinetic energy is negligible. We can assume the annihilation happens at rest. In this scenario, the total initial energy is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n    *   The rest mass of a proton ($m_p$) is equal to the rest mass of an antiproton ($m_{\\bar{p}}$).\n    *   The rest energy of a proton is approximately 938.27 MeV.

The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which implies its kinetic energy is negligible. We can assume both particles are effectively at rest. Therefore, the total initial energy is the sum of their rest mass energies. The rest mass energy of a proton is approximately 938.27 MeV, and an antiproton has the same rest mass.\n3.  **Calculate the final energy ($E_{final}$):** The final state consists of four particles (two $A^+$ and two $A^-$). The total final energy is the sum of the energies of these four particles. By symmetry, each of these four particles will have the same energy, which we'll call $E_A$.

This means each of the four A particles will have the same speed, $v_A$, and thus the same total energy, $E_A$.\n    *   The total energy of a single relativistic particle is $E_A = \\gamma_A m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma_A = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v_A/c)^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The total final energy is the sum of the energies of the four A particles: $E_{final} = 4 E_A = 4 \\gamma_A m_A c^2$.\n\n4.  **Apply the Law of Conservation of Energy:**\n    We equate the total initial energy and the total final energy:\n    $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    $2 m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma_A m_A c^2$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Velocity of Particle A ($v_A$):**\n    *   First, we solve the energy equation for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_A$:\n        $\\gamma_A = \\frac{2 m_p c^2}{4 m_A c^2} = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 m_A c^2}$\n    *   Now, substitute the known values for the rest energies:\n        $\\gamma_A = \\frac{938 \\text{ MeV}}{2 \\times 300 \\text{ MeV}} = \\frac{938}{600} \\approx 1.5633$\n    *   Next, we use the definition of the Lorentz factor to find the velocity. Let $\\beta = v_A/c$.\n        $\\gamma_A = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n    *   Rearrange the formula to solve for $\\beta$:\n        $\\gamma_A^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2} \\implies 1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma_A^2} \\implies \\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_A^2}$\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_A^2}}$\n    *   Substitute the calculated value of $\\gamma_A$:\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5633)^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.444}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.4091}$\n        $\\beta \\approx \\sqrt{0.5909} \\approx 0.7687$\n    *   The velocity of particle A is $v_A = \\beta c \\approx 0.77c$.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated velocity is approximately 0.77c, which corresponds to option D.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **\"Slowly moving\" approximation:** It is critical to interpret this as meaning the initial kinetic energy is negligible, simplifying the initial state to a system at rest.\n*   **Relativistic kinematics:** The energies involved ($m_p c^2 \\gg m_A c^2$) and the resulting speeds require the use of relativistic formulas for energy ($E=\\gamma mc^2$), not classical ones ($E=mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$).\n*   **Symmetry:** The symmetry of the initial state (at rest) and the final state (four identical-mass particles) allows for the simple assumption that energy is distributed equally.\n*   **Constants:** Using the standard value for the proton's rest energy ($m_p c^2 \\approx 938$ MeV) is necessary.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is the step-by-step solution:\n\n**1.

Principle of Conservation of Energy**\n\nThe fundamental principle we will use is the conservation of total energy. The total energy of the system before the annihilation must be equal to the total energy of the system after the annihilation. We will also implicitly use the conservation of momentum.\n\n**2. Initial State Energy ($E_{initial}$)**\n\n*   The initial state consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n*   The problem states that the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". This is a common simplification in such problems, implying that the kinetic energies of the initial particles are negligible compared to their rest mass energies. To satisfy the conservation of momentum (initial momentum must be zero), we analyze the event in the center-of-mass frame, where both the proton and antiproton are effectively at rest.\n*   The total initial energy is therefore the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n*   The rest energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) is approximately 938.3 MeV. The antiproton has the same rest energy.\n*   Therefore, the total initial energy is:\n    $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2$\n    $E_{initial} = 2 \\times 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**3.

The problem gives the rest energy of particle A as $m_A c^2 = 300$ MeV.\n*   Since the initial total momentum is zero, the total momentum of the four final particles must also be zero. By symmetry, the total energy released ($E_{initial}$) will be distributed equally among the four final particles.

Identify the Physical Principles**\n\nThe core principles governing this particle annihilation process are the conservation of energy and the conservation of momentum. Since the resulting particles will be moving at speeds close to the speed of light, we must use relativistic formulas for energy and momentum.\n\n**2. Analyze the Initial State**\n\n*   The initial system consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n*   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". In the context of annihilation, where the energy released from converting mass is enormous, the initial kinetic energy of the particles is negligible compared to their rest mass energy.

Analyze the Final State**\n\n*   The final system consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. All these particles have the same rest mass, $m_A$.\n*   The rest mass energy of each particle A is given as $m_A c^2 = 300 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n*   By the conservation of momentum, the total final momentum ($P_{final}$) must also be zero. This implies that the four particles fly off in such a way that their momentum vectors cancel out.\n*   Due to the symmetry of the final state (four identical mass particles), we can conclude that they will all have the same speed, $v_A$, and therefore the same total energy, $E_A$.\n*   The total energy of a single relativistic particle is given by $E_A = \\gamma_A m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma_A$ is the Lorentz factor, defined as $\\gamma_A = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v_A/c)^2}}$.\n*   The total final energy ($E_{final}$) is the sum of the energies of the four A particles:\n    *   $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma_A m_A c^2$.\n\n**4.

Initial Energy**\nThe initial state consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). The problem states that the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which implies that the initial kinetic energy of the system is negligible compared to the rest mass energy. Therefore, the total initial energy ($E_i$) is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton. Since a proton and an antiproton have the same mass, this is twice the rest energy of a proton.\n\n$E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 m_p c^2$\n\nThe rest energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) is approximately 938.27 MeV.\n\n$E_i = 2 \\times 938.27 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1876.54 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\n**2. Final Energy**\nThe final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. Since they are produced from the annihilation, they will share the total initial energy. By conservation of momentum, if the initial system was at rest, the final particles must move in such a way that the total momentum remains zero. This implies that all four resulting particles will have the same speed, $v$, and therefore the same energy.\n\nThe energy of a single relativistic particle ($E_A$) is given by:\n\n$E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\nwhere $m_A c^2$ is the rest energy of particle A (given as 300 MeV) and $\\gamma$ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$\n\nThe total final energy ($E_f$) is the sum of the energies of the four A particles:\n\n$E_f = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n**3.

Analyze the Initial State and Conservation Laws**\n\n*   **Process:** The reaction is a proton-antiproton annihilation: $p + \\bar{p} \\rightarrow 2A^{+} + 2A^{-}$.\n*   **Initial Conditions:** The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". This is a key piece of information that implies its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. We can therefore assume the annihilation happens with both the proton and antiproton effectively at rest.\n*   **Frame of Reference:** This setup means we are working in the center-of-mass frame.\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the annihilation must equal the total energy after.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the annihilation is zero (since the particles are at rest). Therefore, the total momentum of the four final particles must also be zero.\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Initial Energy**\n\n*   The energy in the initial state is purely the rest mass energy of the proton and the antiproton.\n*   The rest mass energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.3$ MeV.\n*   An antiproton has the same mass as a proton, so $m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 \\approx 938.3$ MeV.\n*   Total initial energy, $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 938.3 \\text{ MeV} + 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**3. Analyze the Final State**\n\n*   The final state consists of four particles: two $A^{+}$ and two $A^{-}$. Since they are likely a particle-antiparticle pair, they have the same mass. The problem gives this mass as $m_A$.\n*   Rest mass energy of particle A is given: $m_A c^2 = 300$ MeV.\n*   The total initial energy of 1876.6 MeV is converted into the total energy of these four A particles.\n*   Due to the conservation of momentum (initial momentum is zero) and the symmetry of the problem, the available energy will be distributed equally among the four final particles. Each particle will have the same energy, $E_A$.\n\n**4. Calculate the Energy of a Single Particle A**\n\n*   The total final energy is $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A$.\n*   Using conservation of energy, $E_{initial} = E_{final}$.\n*   $1876.6 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\times E_A$.\n*   Solving for $E_A$: $E_A = \\frac{1876.6 \\text{ MeV}}{4} = 469.15 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   This value, $E_A$, is the total relativistic energy of a single particle A, which includes both its rest mass energy and its kinetic energy.\n\n**5. Calculate the Velocity of Particle A**\n\n*   The total relativistic energy of a particle is given by the equation $E = \\gamma m c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$.\n*   We can find the Lorentz factor for particle A:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469.15 \\text{ MeV}}{300 \\text{ MeV}} \\approx 1.5638$.\n*   Now, we use the definition of $\\gamma$ to solve for the velocity $v$. Let $\\beta = v/c$.\n    $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n*   Rearranging the formula to solve for $\\beta$:\n    $1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n*   Plugging in the value of $\\gamma$:\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n*   $\\beta \\approx 0.7688$.\n*   Therefore, the velocity of particle A is $v = \\beta c \\approx 0.77c$.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **\"Slowly moving\"**: This phrase is critical. It simplifies the initial state by allowing the assumption of zero initial kinetic energy and zero total momentum.\n2.  **Relativistic vs. Classical**: The energies involved are significantly higher than the rest mass energies, and the resulting velocity is a substantial fraction of the speed of light. Relativistic formulas must be used.\n3.  **Energy Distribution**: In the center-of-mass frame, the energy must be distributed equally among the identical final particles due to symmetry and momentum conservation.\n4.  **Energy Types**: It is important to distinguish between rest mass energy ($mc^2$) and total relativistic energy ($E = \\gamma mc^2$). The energy from the annihilation provides the final particles with both their rest mass energy and their kinetic energy.\n\nThe calculated velocity of approximately 0.77c matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nThis problem can be solved by applying the principles of conservation of energy and momentum in a relativistic context.\n\n**1. Initial State and Energy:**\nThe problem states that a proton ($p$) and a slowly moving antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) annihilate. The term \"slowly moving\" implies that the kinetic energy of the antiproton is negligible compared to its rest energy. Therefore, we can approximate both the proton and antiproton as being at rest in the laboratory frame.\n\nThe total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) of the system is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n*   The rest energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.27 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   An antiproton has the same mass as a proton, so its rest energy is also $m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 \\approx 938.27 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n$E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2 = 2 \\times 938.27 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.54 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**2. Final State and Energy:**\nThe annihilation produces four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. All four particles have the same mass, with a rest energy of $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\nBecause the initial momentum is approximately zero, the final total momentum must also be zero. By symmetry, the four product particles must have the same speed, $v$.\n\nThe total energy of a single moving particle A is given by the relativistic energy formula: $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$\n\nThe total final energy ($E_{final}$) is the sum of the energies of the four A particles:\n$E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n**3. Conservation of Energy:**\nAccording to the principle of conservation of energy, the total initial energy must equal the total final energy:\n$E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n$2 m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n**4. Solving for Velocity (v):**\nFirst, we solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{2 m_p c^2}{4 m_A c^2} = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 m_A c^2}$\n\nNow, substitute the known energy values:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{938.27 \\text{ MeV}}{2 \\times 300 \\text{ MeV}} = \\frac{938.27}{600} \\approx 1.5638$\n\nNext, we use the definition of the Lorentz factor to solve for the velocity $v$. Let $\\beta = v/c$:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\beta^2}}$\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1-\\beta^2}$\n$1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nSubstitute the value of $\\gamma$ we calculated:\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911} \\approx 0.7688$\n\nSo, the velocity of particle A is $v = \\beta c \\approx 0.769c$.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 0.77c\nB) 0.86c\nC) 0.96c\nD) 0.91c\n\nThe calculated value of 0.769c is closest to 0.77c.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to determine the velocity of particle A.\n\n### 1. Conservation of Energy\n\nThe process begins with a proton ($p$) and a slowly moving antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). The term \"slowly moving\" implies that we can neglect the kinetic energy of the antiproton. Assuming the proton is at rest, the total initial energy ($E_i$) is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n\nThe rest energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) is approximately 938 MeV. Since a proton and an antiproton have the same mass, their rest energies are identical.\n\n*   **Initial Energy ($E_i$):**\n    $E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2$\n    $E_i = 2 \\times 938 \\text{ MeV} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$\n\nThe annihilation results in four particles ($2A^+$, $2A^-$), each with a mass corresponding to a rest energy ($m_A c^2$) of 300 MeV. The total final energy ($E_f$) is the sum of the relativistic energies of these four particles. Due to the conservation of momentum (the initial momentum is near zero), the four resulting particles will share the energy, and by symmetry, they will all have the same speed, $v$.\n\nThe relativistic energy of a single particle A is given by $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\n*   **Final Energy ($E_f$):**\n    $E_f = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\times \\gamma m_A c^2$\n    $E_f = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times 300 \\text{ MeV} = 1200 \\gamma \\text{ MeV}$\n\nAccording to the law of conservation of energy, the initial energy must equal the final energy ($E_i = E_f$).\n\n$1876 \\text{ MeV} = 1200 \\gamma \\text{ MeV}$\n\n### 2. Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)\n\nWe can now solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1876}{1200} \\approx 1.5633$\n\n### 3. Calculate the Velocity (v)\n\nThe Lorentz factor is related to the velocity by the equation:\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n\nTo find the velocity, we rearrange the formula to solve for $v$:\n\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n\n$1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n\n$(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nNow, we can substitute the calculated value of $\\gamma$:\n\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5633)^2}}$\n\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.444}}$\n\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4092}$\n\n$v/c = \\sqrt{0.5908}$\n\n$v/c \\approx 0.7686$\n\nTherefore, the velocity of particle A is approximately $0.77c$.\n\n$v \\approx 0.77c$\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 0.77c\nB) 0.91c\nC) 0.86c\nD) 0.96c\n\nThe calculated velocity matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to determine the velocity of particle A.\n\n1.  **Identify the physical principles:** The process is governed by the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.\n\n2.  **Define the initial and final states:**\n    *   **Initial State:** We have a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). The antiproton is described as \"slowly moving,\" which implies its kinetic energy is negligible. This allows us to consider the annihilation as occurring essentially \"at rest.\" In the center-of-mass frame of the system, the total initial momentum is zero. The total initial energy ($E_i$) is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and antiproton.\n    *   **Final State:** The annihilation produces four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. Let's assume $A^+$ and $A^-$ are antiparticles of each other with the same rest mass, $m_A$.\n\n3.  **Apply Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial momentum is zero, the total momentum of the four final particles must also be zero. This means they will fly off in directions such that their vector momenta cancel out.\n\n4.  **Apply Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   The total initial energy is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and antiproton. The mass of an antiproton is the same as the mass of a proton ($m_p$). Therefore, $E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 m_p c^2$.\n    *   The total final energy ($E_f$) is the sum of the total energies of the four resulting particles. Since momentum is conserved, the energy will be distributed equally among the four identical particles. The total energy of a single particle A is given by the relativistic formula $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = 1 / \\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}$. So, the total final energy is $E_f = 4 E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$.\n    *   Equating the initial and final energies:\n        $E_i = E_f$\n        $2 m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n5.  **Solve for the velocity:**\n    *   First, we can simplify the energy conservation equation:\n        $m_p c^2 = 2 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n    *   Now, we solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 m_A c^2}$\n    *   We are given $m_A c^2 = 300 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n    *   The rest energy of a proton, $m_p c^2$, is approximately 938.3 MeV.\n    *   Substitute these values into the equation for $\\gamma$:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{938.3 \\, \\text{MeV}}{2 \\times 300 \\, \\text{MeV}} = \\frac{938.3}{600} \\approx 1.564$\n    *   Now, use the definition of the Lorentz factor to solve for the velocity ($v$). Let $\\beta = v/c$:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n        $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n        $1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    *   Substitute the calculated value of $\\gamma$:\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.564)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.446}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4088}$\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{0.5912} \\approx 0.7689$\n    *   Therefore, the velocity of particle A is $v = \\beta c \\approx 0.77c$.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is the step-by-step derivation of the velocity of particle A.\n\n**1.

To find the velocity of particle A, we must apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Initial State Energy ($E_i$):**\n    The problem states that the antiproton is \"slowly moving.\" In particle physics, this is a common simplification meaning we can assume the initial system is effectively at rest. Therefore, the initial kinetic energy is negligible, and the total initial energy is the sum of the rest energies of the proton ($p$) and the antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    The rest energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.27$ MeV. An antiproton has the exact same mass.\n    $E_i = E_{rest, p} + E_{rest, \\bar{p}} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2$\n    $E_i = 2 \\times 938.27 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.54 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n2.  **Final State Energy ($E_f$):**\n    The final state consists of four particles: two $A^{+}$ and two $A^{-}$. Since $A^{+}$ and $A^{-}$ are a particle-antiparticle pair, they have the same mass, $m_A$. The problem gives the rest energy as $m_A c^2 = 300$ MeV.\n    The total final energy is the sum of the total energies of these four particles.\n    $E_f = E_{A_1} + E_{A_2} + E_{A_3} + E_{A_4}$\n\n3.  **Conservation of Momentum and Energy Distribution:**\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial system is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero ($P_i = 0$). By conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero ($P_f = 0$). This means the four final particles must fly off in directions such that their vector momenta sum to zero.\n    *   **Energy Distribution:** Due to the symmetry of the final state (four particles of identical mass) and the requirement of zero total momentum, the total energy released from the annihilation will be distributed equally among the four particles.\n    *   Therefore, the total energy of each particle A ($E_A$) is one-fourth of the total initial energy.\n\n4.  **Energy of a Single Particle A:**\n    From the conservation of energy, $E_i = E_f$.\n    $1876.54 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\times E_A$\n    $E_A = \\frac{1876.54 \\text{ MeV}}{4} = 469.135 \\text{ MeV}$\n    This value, $E_A$, represents the total energy (rest energy + kinetic energy) of a single particle A.\n\n5.  **Calculating Velocity from Energy:**\n    The total energy of a relativistic particle is given by the formula $E = \\gamma m c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, defined as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$.\n    *   We can first find the Lorentz factor for particle A:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469.135 \\text{ MeV}}{300 \\text{ MeV}} \\approx 1.5638$\n    *   Now, we solve for the velocity, $v$.\n        $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n        $1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n        $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n        $v/c \\approx 0.7688$\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The velocity of particle A is approximately 0.77 times the speed of light ($0.77c$). This matches option C. The provided code output confirms this calculation precisely.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nThis problem can be solved by applying the principles of conservation of energy and momentum from special relativity.\n\n### Reasoning and Solution\n\n1.  **Initial State Analysis:**\n    *   The initial state consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    *   The problem states that the antiproton is \"slowly moving.\" In particle physics, this implies its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest energy. We can therefore assume both the proton and the antiproton are effectively at rest in the center-of-mass frame.\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial particles are at rest, the total initial momentum of the system is zero. By the law of conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the final particles must also be zero.\n    *   **Initial Energy ($E_{initial}$):** The total initial energy is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton. The rest energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.3$ MeV.

An antiproton has the same rest mass.\n\n2.  **Final State Analysis**: The annihilation produces four particles, two $A^{+}$ and two $A^{-}$, all with the same mass $m_{A}$. The problem gives the rest mass energy of particle A as $m_{A}c^{2}=300$ MeV.\n    *   Because the total initial momentum is zero, the four final particles must share the total initial energy equally, and they will all have the same speed, *v*.\n\n3.  **Applying Conservation of Energy**: The total initial energy must equal the total final energy.\n    *   Initial Energy ($E_i$): $E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times (m_p c^2)$\n    *   Final Energy ($E_f$): The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the four 'A' particles.

The total final energy is thus $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$.\n4.  **Equate and Solve for Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**: By setting $E_{initial} = E_{final}$, we get $2 m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$. We can solve this equation for $\\gamma$.\n5.  **Calculate Velocity ($v$)**: The Lorentz factor is defined as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$. Once we have the value for $\\gamma$, we can rearrange this formula to solve for the velocity $v$ as a fraction of the speed of light, $c$. The result, often denoted as $\\beta = v/c$, can be calculated using $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to find the velocity of particle A.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_annihilation_velocity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the velocity of particle A from the annihilation of a proton and an antiproton.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given values\n    m_p_c2 = 938.27  # Rest energy of a proton in MeV\n    m_A_c2 = 300.0   # Rest energy of particle A in MeV\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the total initial energy.\n    # We assume the initial proton and antiproton are effectively at rest.\n    E_initial = 2 * m_p_c2\n\n    # Step 2: By conservation of energy, the total final energy is equal to the initial energy.\n    E_final = E_initial\n\n    # Step 3: The final energy is distributed equally among the four 'A' particles.\n    # Calculate the total energy of a single particle A.\n    E_A = E_final / 4\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma) for particle A.\n    # The total energy of a particle is E = gamma * m * c^2.\n    gamma = E_A / m_A_c2\n\n    # Step 5: Calculate the velocity ratio beta (v/c) from the Lorentz factor.\n    # beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2)\n    if gamma < 1:\n        # This case is physically impossible as it would mean the rest mass\n        # of the products is greater than the initial energy.\n        print(\"Error: The process is not energetically possible with the given masses.\")\n        return\n\n    beta = math.sqrt(1 - 1 / gamma**2)\n    velocity = beta\n\n    # Print the result and the available choices\n    print(f\"The calculated velocity of particle A is {velocity:.3f}c.\")\n    print(\"\\nPlease select from the following options:\")\n    print(\"A) 0.77c\")\n    print(\"B) 0.91c\")\n    print(\"C) 0.96c\")\n    print(\"D) 0.86c\")\n\nsolve_annihilation_velocity()\n```\n<<<A>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The calculated velocity of particle A is 0.769c.\n\nPlease select from the following options:\nA) 0.77c\nB) 0.91c\nC) 0.96c\nD) 0.86c\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the physical principles:** The problem describes a particle-antiparticle annihilation. Such processes are governed by the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum, within the framework of special relativity.\n\n2.  **Analyze the initial state:**\n    *   The initial particles are a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    *   The antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which means its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. We can approximate its kinetic energy as zero.\n    *   Typically in such problems, if one particle's motion is specified, the other (the proton) is assumed to be at rest in the laboratory frame. So, its kinetic energy is also zero.\n    *   Therefore, the total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n    *   The total initial momentum ($\\vec{P}_{initial}$) is approximately zero, as both particles are effectively at rest.\n\n3.  **Calculate the initial energy:**\n    *   The rest mass energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n    *   An antiproton has the same mass as a proton, so $m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = m_p c^2$.\n    *   $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2 = 2 \\times 938 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1876 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n\n4.  **Analyze the final state:**\n    *   The final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. Since they are all of type 'A', they have the same rest mass, $m_A$.\n    *   We are given the rest mass energy of particle A: $m_A c^2 = 300 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial momentum was zero, the total final momentum must also be zero. $\\vec{P}_{final} = \\vec{0}$.\n    *   **Symmetry and Energy Distribution:** For the total momentum to be zero, the particles must fly out in directions that cancel each other out. The question asks for \"the velocity of particle A,\" implying all four final particles have the same speed ($v$). This symmetric outcome is the most straightforward way to conserve both energy and momentum. The total available energy will be distributed equally among the four particles.\n    *   The total energy of a single A particle is $E_A$. The total final energy is $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A$.\n\n5.  **Apply Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   Set the initial energy equal to the final energy: $E_{initial} = E_{final}$.\n    *   $1876 \\, \\text{MeV} = 4 \\times E_A$.\n    *   Solve for the energy of a single particle A:\n        $E_A = \\frac{1876 \\, \\text{MeV}}{4} = 469 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the velocity:**\n    *   The total energy of a relativistic particle is given by $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   We can now solve for $\\gamma$:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469 \\, \\text{MeV}}{300 \\, \\text{MeV}} \\approx 1.5633$.\n    *   Now, we solve for the velocity $v$ from the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$. Let $\\beta = v/c$.\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n        $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n        $1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    *   Substitute the value of $\\gamma$:\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5633)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.444}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4091} = \\sqrt{0.5909}$\n        $\\beta \\approx 0.7687$.\n    *   Therefore, the velocity of particle A is $v = \\beta c \\approx 0.77c$.\n\n7.  **Compare with the options:**\n    *   The calculated velocity $0.77c$ matches option B.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Relativistic formulas are necessary:** The energies involved are significantly larger than the rest mass energies, and the resulting speeds are a substantial fraction of the speed of light.\n*   **\"Slowly moving\" approximation:** This is a crucial simplification that sets the initial kinetic energy and momentum to zero.\n*   **Symmetry assumption:** Assuming the final energy is distributed equally among the four identical particles is a standard and reasonable approach for this type of problem, stemming from the conservation of momentum and the symmetric nature of the initial state.\n*   **Use of correct mass-energy values:** Using the standard value for the proton's rest mass energy ($m_p c^2 \\approx 938$ MeV) is essential.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$.\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nTo solve this problem, we apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n### Reasoning and Solution\n\n1.  **Initial State**: The process involves a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which in particle physics contexts implies its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. For simplicity and to conserve momentum, we can assume both particles are effectively at rest before annihilation. This is known as annihilation at rest.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum**:\n    *   Since the proton and antiproton are at rest, the total initial momentum of the system is zero.\n    *   By the law of conservation of momentum, the total final momentum of the four product particles ($2A^+$ and $2A^-$) must also be zero.\n\n3.  **Conservation of Energy**:\n    *   **Initial Energy ($E_i$)**: The total initial energy is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton. The rest mass of a proton ($m_p$) is the same as that of an antiproton, which is approximately $m_p c^2 = 938.3 \\text{ MeV}$.\n        $E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2 = 2 \\times 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n    *   **Final Energy ($E_f$)**: The final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. The problem gives the rest energy of particle A as $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$. Due to the conservation of momentum (total final momentum is zero) and the fact that the resulting particles have the same mass, the total energy released will be distributed equally among the four particles. Thus, each particle will have the same total energy $E_A$ and the same speed $v$.\n        The total energy of a single relativistic particle is given by $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n        The total final energy is the sum of the energies of the four particles:\n        $E_f = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n4.  **Equating Energies and Solving for Velocity**:\n    *   According to the conservation of energy, $E_i = E_f$:\n        $1876.6 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times (300 \\text{ MeV})$\n    *   Now, we can solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{1876.6}{4 \\times 300} = \\frac{1876.6}{1200} \\approx 1.5638$\n    *   Finally, we solve for the velocity $v$ using the definition of $\\gamma$. Let $\\beta = v/c$.\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n        $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n        $1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    *   Substituting the value of $\\gamma$:\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} \\approx \\sqrt{0.5911} \\approx 0.7688$\n\n5.  **Conclusion**:\n    The velocity of particle A is $v = \\beta c \\approx 0.769c$.

The annihilation results in the creation of two pairs of particle A and antiparticle A⁻.\n\n1.  **Conservation of Energy**: The total initial energy of the system is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton. Since the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" its kinetic energy is negligible.\n\n*   The rest mass energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) is approximately 938.3 MeV.\n*   The rest mass energy of an antiproton ($m_{\\bar{p}} c^2$) is identical to that of a proton.\n*   Initial Energy ($E_i$):\n    $E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 \\approx 938.3 \\text{ MeV} + 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n    This initial energy is converted into the total energy of the four final particles ($2A^+$ and $2A^-$).\n\n2.  **Final Energy**: The final energy ($E_f$) is the sum of the total energies of the four 'A' particles. Since momentum is conserved and the initial momentum is approximately zero, the four resulting particles must have equal speeds to have a single defined velocity. The total energy for each particle 'A' is given by the relativistic formula $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n*   Rest mass energy of particle A ($m_A c^2$) = 300 MeV.\n*   Final Energy ($E_f$):\n    $E_f = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\times \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n3.  **Equating Initial and Final Energy**:\n    $E_i = E_f$\n    $1876.6 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times (300 \\text{ MeV})$\n    $1876.6 = 1200 \\gamma$\n\n4.  **Solving for the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1876.6}{1200} \\approx 1.5638$\n\n5.  **Calculating the Velocity**: The Lorentz factor is related to the velocity (v) by the equation $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$. We can rearrange this to solve for $v$.\n\n*   Let $\\beta = v/c$.

The annihilation process begins with a proton ($p$) and a slowly moving antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). \"Slowly moving\" implies that the kinetic energy of the antiproton is negligible, and we can assume the proton is at rest. Therefore, the initial energy of the system is almost entirely the rest mass energy of the two particles.\n\nThe final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$, all with the same mass $m_A$.

The antiproton is \"slowly moving.\" This is a key phrase. In particle physics, \"slowly moving\" or \"at rest\" usually implies that the initial kinetic energy is negligible compared to the rest mass energy.

Since the resulting particles are expected to move at high speeds, we must use the principles of special relativity.\n2.  **Calculate the initial energy ($E_{initial}$):** The system initially consists of a proton and an antiproton. The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which implies its kinetic energy is negligible. To conserve momentum (assuming the total momentum is initially zero), we can consider both particles to be effectively at rest. Therefore, the total initial energy is the sum of their rest mass energies.\n    *   Rest energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$): ~938.3 MeV\n    *   Rest energy of an antiproton is identical.\n    *   $E_{initial} = 2 \\times m_p c^2$\n3.  **Define the final energy ($E_{final}$):** The final state has four particles (two $A^+$ and two $A^-$). By symmetry, they will all move with the same speed, $v$. The total energy of a particle moving at relativistic speed is $E = \\gamma m c^2$, where $\\gamma = 1 / \\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   Rest energy of one A particle ($m_A c^2$): 300 MeV\n    *   $E_{final} = 4 \\times (\\gamma m_A c^2)$\n4.  **Apply Conservation of Energy:** Set $E_{initial} = E_{final}$.\n    *   $2 \\times m_p c^2 = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times m_A c^2$\n5.  **Solve for velocity:** I will first solve the equation for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.

This process converts their mass entirely into other forms of energy, which in this case are the rest mass and kinetic energy of four new particles: two $A^{+}$ and two $A^{-}$.\n    The reaction is: $p + \\bar{p} \\rightarrow 2A^{+} + 2A^{-}$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Initial State and Identify Key Information:**\n    *   **Particles:** A proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    *   **Mass of Proton/Antiproton:** The rest mass energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.3 \\text{ MeV}$. An antiproton has the exact same mass, so $m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = m_p c^2$.\n    *   **Initial Motion:** The antiproton is \"slowly moving\". This is a critical phrase in particle physics problems. It implies that its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. For this type of symmetric annihilation, it's standard to assume the process happens \"at rest\" in the center-of-mass frame. This means the total initial momentum is zero, and the total initial kinetic energy is also approximately zero.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Final State:**\n    *   **Particles:** Four particles are produced: two $A^{+}$ and two $A^{-}$. Since $A^{+}$ and $A^{-}$ are antiparticles of each other, they must have the same mass, $m_A$.\n    *   **Mass of Particle A:** We are given that the rest mass energy of particle A is $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n4.  **Apply Conservation Laws:**\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the reaction must equal the total energy after the reaction.\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the reaction must equal the total momentum after the reaction.\n\n5.  **Careful Points and Assumptions:**\n    *   **Initial Energy:** Based on the \"slowly moving\" assumption, we take the initial kinetic energy of the system to be zero. Therefore, the total initial energy is purely the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and antiproton.\n    *   **Final State Energy & Momentum Distribution:** The initial momentum is zero. By conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the four final particles must also be zero. The question asks for \"the velocity\" of particle A, implying a single, unique value. This strongly suggests a symmetric decay where the available kinetic energy is distributed equally among the four final particles. This means all four particles will have the same speed.\n    *   **Relativistic Mechanics:** The energies involved (hundreds of MeV) are comparable to the rest mass energies of the particles. Therefore, we must use the principles of special relativity, specifically the formulas for relativistic energy and momentum. Using classical mechanics ($K = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$) would give an incorrect result.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total initial energy ($E_{initial}$)**\nSince the proton and antiproton are considered to be at rest, their energy is their rest mass energy.\n$E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2$\n$E_{initial} = 938.3 \\text{ MeV} + 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**Step 2: Apply Conservation of Energy to find the total final energy ($E_{final}$)**\nAccording to the law of conservation of energy, $E_{final} = E_{initial}$.\n$E_{final} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$\nThis total final energy is shared among the four A particles.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the energy of a single final particle A ($E_A$)**\nDue to the symmetry of the final state (four particles of equal mass), we can assume the total energy is distributed equally among them.\n$E_A = \\frac{E_{final}}{4} = \\frac{1876.6 \\text{ MeV}}{4} = 469.15 \\text{ MeV}$\nThis is the total energy (rest mass energy + kinetic energy) of one particle A.\n\n**Step 4: Use the relativistic energy formula to find the velocity ($v$)**\nThe total relativistic energy of a particle is given by $E = \\gamma m c^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\nWe have:\n*   Total energy of one particle A: $E_A = 469.15 \\text{ MeV}$\n*   Rest mass energy of one particle A: $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$\n\nNow, we can find the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469.15 \\text{ MeV}}{300 \\text{ MeV}} \\approx 1.5638$\n\nFinally, we solve for the velocity $v$. Let $\\beta = v/c$.\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n$1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nPlugging in the value for $\\gamma$:\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911} \\approx 0.7688$\n\nSo, the velocity of particle A is $v \\approx 0.77c$. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 49:\nThe calculation has been performed and verified.

We solve for $\\beta = v/c$:\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - 1/(1.5638)^2} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} \\approx 0.7688$\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The velocity of particle A is $v \\approx 0.7688c$.

Initial State and Energy Conservation**\n\nThe problem describes the annihilation of a proton ($p$) and a slowly moving antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). \"Slowly moving\" implies we can neglect the antiproton's kinetic energy.

Principle of Conservation of Energy**\n\nThe core principle to solve this problem is the conservation of total relativistic energy. The total energy before the annihilation must equal the total energy after the annihilation.\n$E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n\n**2. Initial State Energy ($E_{initial}$)**\n\n*   The initial state consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n*   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". This is a common simplification in particle physics problems, indicating that the initial kinetic energy of the system is negligible compared to the rest mass energy. We can therefore assume both particles are effectively at rest.\n*   The total initial energy is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton. The mass of a proton and an antiproton are identical.\n*   Rest energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) ≈ 938.3 MeV.\n*   $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2 = 2 \\times 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**3. Final State Energy ($E_{final}$)**\n\n*   The final state consists of four particles: two $A^{+}$ and two $A^{-}$. Since they are produced as a result of the annihilation and the initial momentum is zero, the total final momentum must also be zero. For momentum to be conserved, the energy must be distributed equally among the four identical-mass particles, meaning they will all have the same speed, $v_A$, and thus the same energy, $E_A$.\n*   The total energy of a single relativistic particle is given by $E = \\gamma m c^2$, where $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is $1/\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}$.\n*   The rest energy of particle A is given as $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   The total final energy is the sum of the energies of the four A particles:\n    $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\times \\gamma_A m_A c^2$.\n\n**4. Solving for the Velocity**\n\nNow, we equate the initial and final energies and solve for the velocity of particle A.\n\n$E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n$2 m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma_A m_A c^2$\n\nFirst, let's solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_A$:\n\n$\\gamma_A = \\frac{2 m_p c^2}{4 m_A c^2} = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 m_A c^2}$\n\nSubstitute the known values:\n\n$\\gamma_A = \\frac{938.3 \\text{ MeV}}{2 \\times 300 \\text{ MeV}} = \\frac{938.3}{600} \\approx 1.564$\n\nNext, we use the definition of the Lorentz factor to find the velocity, $v_A$. Let $\\beta = v_A/c$.\n\n$\\gamma_A = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n\nRearrange the equation to solve for $\\beta$:\n\n$\\gamma_A^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n$1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma_A^2}$\n$\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_A^2}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_A^2}}$\n\nSubstitute the calculated value of $\\gamma_A$:\n\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.564)^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.446}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.4088} \\approx \\sqrt{0.5912} \\approx 0.7689$\n\nThe velocity of particle A is $v_A = \\beta c \\approx 0.769c$.\n\nThis value is closest to 0.77c. The python code confirmed this calculation, yielding a result of 0.7688c.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\nTo solve this problem, we will use the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n### 1. Conservation of Energy\n\nThe process is the annihilation of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) into four new particles ($2A^{+} + 2A^{-}$).\n\n*   **Initial State:** A proton and a slowly moving antiproton. Since the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" its kinetic energy is negligible. Therefore, the total initial energy is approximately the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n*   **Final State:** Four particles ($A^+, A^+, A^-, A^-$). These particles will be moving at high velocity.\n\nThe energy conservation equation is:\n\n*Total Initial Energy = Total Final Energy*\n\n$E_{p} + E_{\\bar{p}} = E_{A^+} + E_{A^+} + E_{A^-} + E_{A^-}$\n\nThe rest energy of a particle is given by Einstein's equation, $E = mc^2$. The rest energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) is approximately 938 MeV. The antiproton has the same mass as the proton, so its rest energy is also 938 MeV.\n\n*   Initial Energy $\\approx (m_p c^2) + (m_{\\bar{p}} c^2) = 938 \\, \\text{MeV} + 938 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1876 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n\nThe particles $A^+$ and $A^-$ have the same mass, with a rest energy of $m_A c^2 = 300 \\, \\text{MeV}$. The total energy of a single moving particle A is its relativistic energy, $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\n*   Final Energy = $4 \\times (\\gamma m_A c^2) = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times (300 \\, \\text{MeV}) = 1200\\gamma \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n\nEquating the initial and final energies:\n\n$1876 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1200\\gamma \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\n### 2. Momentum Conservation\n\nThe initial momentum of the system is considered to be zero since the antiproton is moving slowly. For the total momentum to remain zero after the annihilation, the four resulting A particles must be emitted in such a way that their vector momenta sum to zero. Due to the symmetry of the products, the magnitude of the velocity will be the same for all four particles.\n\n### 3. Calculation of Velocity\n\nNow, we can solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1876}{1200} \\approx 1.5633$\n\nNext, we use the definition of the Lorentz factor to find the velocity, $v$. Let $\\beta = v/c$.\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n\n$1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n\n$\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nSubstituting the value of $\\gamma$:\n\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5633)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.444}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.409} = \\sqrt{0.591}$\n\n$\\beta \\approx 0.7688$\n\nThus, the velocity of particle A is approximately $0.77c$.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0.77c\nB) 0.96c\nC) 0.91c\nD) 0.86c\n\nThe calculated velocity matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\nHere is the step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1.

The problem states that the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which implies its kinetic energy is negligible. We assume the proton is also at rest. Therefore, the total initial energy of the system is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n\n*   The rest mass energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) is approximately 938 MeV.\n*   An antiproton has the same mass as a proton, so its rest mass energy ($m_{\\bar{p}} c^2$) is also 938 MeV.\n\nTotal Initial Energy ($E_{initial}$) = $m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2$\n$E_{initial} = 938 \\text{ MeV} + 938 \\text{ MeV} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**2. Determine the Final Energy**\n\nThe annihilation results in four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$.\n\n*   The rest mass energy of each particle A ($m_A c^2$) is given as 300 MeV.\n*   The total final energy ($E_{final}$) is the sum of the total energies of these four particles. Since energy is conserved, all the initial energy is converted into the total energy of the four A particles.\n\n$E_{final} = E_{initial} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**3. Calculate the Energy per Particle A**\n\nThe total final energy is shared equally among the four resulting particles.\n\nEnergy per particle A ($E_A$) = $\\frac{E_{final}}{4}$\n$E_A = \\frac{1876 \\text{ MeV}}{4} = 469 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**4. Calculate the Velocity of Particle A**\n\nThe total energy of a relativistic particle ($E_A$) is given by the equation $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is defined as $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\n*   We know $E_A = 469$ MeV and $m_A c^2 = 300$ MeV.

Initial State Analysis**\n*   The process begins with a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n*   The antiproton is described as \"slowly moving,\" which means we can approximate its initial kinetic energy as zero.\n*   Assuming the proton is at rest in the lab frame, the total initial momentum of the system is zero.\n*   The total initial energy ($E_i$) is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton.
