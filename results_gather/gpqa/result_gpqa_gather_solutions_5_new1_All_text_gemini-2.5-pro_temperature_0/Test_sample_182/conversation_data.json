Analyze the Starting Material**\n\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: A six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbon 3 and carbon 4.\n*   **carboxylic acid**: A -COOH group. By IUPAC convention, this group is at position C1.\n*   **2-formyl**: A -CHO (aldehyde) group at position C2.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A -CH=CH₂ group at position C5.\n\nThe structure contains the following features that contribute to the index of hydrogen deficiency:\n*   One ring (the cyclohexane core).\n*   One C=C double bond within the ring.\n*   One C=C double bond in the vinyl group.\n*   One C=O double bond in the formyl group.\n*   One C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group.\n\nThe IHD is the sum of the number of rings and the number of pi bonds.\nIHD (starting material) = 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C in ring) + 1 (C=C in vinyl) + 1 (C=O in formyl) + 1 (C=O in carboxyl) = 5.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\nThe reagent used is **red phosphorus and excess of HI (Red P + HI)**. This is a very powerful reducing agent. Its function is to reduce various functional groups completely to their corresponding alkanes. Specifically:\n*   It reduces aldehydes (-CHO) to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   It reduces carboxylic acids (-COOH) to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n\nThe reaction will proceed as follows:\n*   The **formyl group** (-CHO) at C2 will be reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n*   The **carboxylic acid group** (-COOH) at C1 will be reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n*   The **C=C double bond** in the cyclohexene ring will be reduced to a C-C single bond, converting the cyclohexene ring into a **cyclohexane ring**.\n*   The **vinyl group** (-CH=CH₂) at C5 will be reduced to an **ethyl group** (-CH₂-CH₃).\n\n**3. Determine the Structure of the Product**\n\nThe reaction starts with a substituted cyclohexene and reduces all the functional groups and double bonds. The carbon skeleton, including the ring, remains intact.\n*   The cyclohexene ring becomes a **cyclohexane** ring.\n*   The substituents become simple alkyl groups: two methyl groups and one ethyl group.\n\nThe product is a substituted cyclohexane (specifically, 5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane, although the exact name is not required).\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe IHD is a count of the rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n*   **Rings:** The product molecule contains one ring (the cyclohexane ring).\n*   **Pi Bonds:** The reaction with Red P + HI reduces all C=C and C=O double bonds to single bonds. Therefore, the product has zero pi bonds.\n\nIHD (product) = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds)\nIHD (product) = 1 + 0 = 1\n\nAlternatively, we can determine the molecular formula of the product. The starting material has 10 carbon atoms (6 in the ring, 1 in COOH, 1 in CHO, 2 in vinyl). The reduction does not change the number of carbons. The product is a substituted cyclohexane with 10 carbon atoms. The general formula for a monocyclic alkane (a saturated compound with one ring) is CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   For our product, n = 10.\n*   The molecular formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n\nNow, we can use the IHD formula:\nIHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (20/2)\nIHD = 11 - 10\nIHD = 1\n\nBoth methods yield an IHD of 1 for the final product.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\nA) 3\nB) 1\nC) 0\nD) 5\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product, we must first understand the chemical transformation that occurs.\n\n### 1. The Reactant and its Structure\n\nThe starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Cyclohex-3-ene:** A six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4.\n*   **Carboxylic acid:** A -COOH group, which we'll place at position 1.\n*   **2-formyl:** A -CHO (aldehyde) group at position 2.\n*   **5-vinyl:** A -CH=CH₂ group at position 5.\n\nThe molecular formula for this reactant is C₁₀H₁₂O₃.\n\n### 2. The Reaction\n\nThe reactant is treated with red phosphorus (P) and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination is a powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. It is known to reduce several functional groups to alkanes:\n*   **Carboxylic acids (-COOH)** are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   **Aldehydes (-CHO)** are also reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   **Alkenes (C=C)** are reduced to alkanes (C-C).\n*   **Alcohols (-OH)** are reduced to alkanes (-H).\n\nIn this reaction, all oxygen-containing functional groups and all carbon-carbon double bonds will be fully reduced.\n\n### 3. The Product\n\nThe reaction will result in the following transformations on the starting molecule:\n*   The **carboxylic acid** group at position 1 becomes a **methyl group**.\n*   The **formyl (aldehyde)** group at position 2 becomes a **methyl group**.\n*   The **carbon-carbon double bond** within the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a single bond, converting the ring to a **cyclohexane** skeleton.\n*   The **vinyl group** (-CH=CH₂) at position 5 is reduced to an **ethyl group** (-CH₂CH₃).\n\nThe carbon skeleton of the molecule, which consists of 10 carbon atoms (6 in the ring, 1 in the carboxyl group, 1 in the formyl group, and 2 in the vinyl group), remains intact. The final product is a saturated cycloalkane, specifically a disubstituted ethyl-dimethyl-cyclohexane. The exact IUPAC name (e.g., 1-ethyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohexane) is not necessary to determine the molecular formula.\n\nSince the product is a saturated monocyclic alkane with 10 carbon atoms, its general formula will be CₙH₂ₙ, which is C₁₀H₂₀.\n\n### 4. Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, indicates the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. It is calculated using the molecular formula:\n\nIHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\n\nWhere:\n*   C is the number of carbon atoms.\n*   H is the number of hydrogen atoms.\n\nFor the product with the molecular formula C₁₀H₂₀:\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2)\nIHD = 11 - 10\nIHD = 1\n\nAn IHD of 1 corresponds to the presence of a single ring in the saturated cycloalkane product.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactant:** First, we need to understand the structure of the starting material, \"2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid\", and determine its key features that contribute to the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD). The IHD (also known as the degree of unsaturation) is the sum of the number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n    *   **cyclohex**: This indicates one ring structure (IHD = 1).\n    *   **-3-ene**: This indicates one carbon-carbon double bond within the ring (IHD = 1).\n    *   **vinyl**: This is a -CH=CH2 group, which contains one carbon-carbon double bond (IHD = 1).\n    *   **formyl**: This is a -CHO group, which contains one carbon-oxygen double bond (IHD = 1).\n    *   **carboxylic acid**: This is a -COOH group, which contains one carbon-oxygen double bond (IHD = 1).\n    *   The total IHD of the reactant is 1 (ring) + 1 (ene) + 1 (vinyl) + 1 (formyl) + 1 (acid) = 5.\n\n2.  **Understand the Reaction:** The reactant is treated with red phosphorus and an excess of HI. This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. Its function is to reduce most oxygen-containing functional groups and carbon-carbon multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated alkanes.\n    *   The C=C double bond in the ring will be reduced to a C-C single bond.\n    *   The C=C double bond in the vinyl group will be reduced to a C-C single bond.\n    *   The C=O double bond in the formyl group will be reduced, and the whole group becomes a methyl (-CH3).\n    *   The C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group will be reduced, and the whole group becomes a methyl (-CH3).\n    *   Importantly, this reaction does *not* break the ring structure.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product and its IHD:** After the reaction, all the pi bonds (from C=C and C=O) are removed. The only feature contributing to the IHD that remains is the original cyclohexane ring. Therefore, the IHD of the final product is 1.\n\n4.  **Calculate using Molecular Formula (for verification):**\n    *   **Reactant:** The molecular formula is C10H12O3. IHD = C + 1 - H/2 = 10 + 1 - 12/2 = 5.\n    *   **Product:** The reaction removes all oxygen and saturates all pi bonds, without changing the number of carbons. The resulting product is a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon. The general formula for a monocyclic alkane is CnH2n. Since the product has 10 carbon atoms, its formula is C10H20.\n    *   **Product IHD Calculation:** Using the formula for the product (C10H20):\n        IHD = C + 1 - H/2 = 10 + 1 - 20/2 = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\nThe code below will perform this final calculation.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the properties of the reactant.\n# The reactant is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n# Let's determine its molecular formula.\n# Carbons (C): 6 (ring) + 1 (COOH) + 1 (CHO) + 2 (vinyl) = 10\n# The reaction with red P and excess HI is a complete reduction.\n# It reduces all C=C and C=O bonds and removes oxygen atoms, but does not break the ring.\n# The number of carbon atoms in the product remains the same.\nnum_carbons_product = 10\n\n# Step 2: Determine the molecular formula of the product.\n# The product is a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon (a substituted cycloalkane).\n# The general formula for a monocyclic alkane is C_n H_{2n}.\n# For n=10, the formula is C10H20.\nnum_hydrogens_product = 2 * num_carbons_product\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) for the product.\n# The formula for IHD is: C + 1 - (H/2)\n# where C is the number of carbon atoms and H is the number of hydrogen atoms.\nihd_product = num_carbons_product + 1 - (num_hydrogens_product / 2)\n\n# Step 4: Print the result and the corresponding choice.\nprint(\"The reaction involves the complete reduction of 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\")\nprint(\"The reactant has multiple double bonds (C=C and C=O) and a ring.\")\nprint(\"Red P and excess HI reduce all double bonds but do not open the ring.\")\nprint(f\"The number of carbon atoms in the product is {num_carbons_product}.\")\nprint(f\"The product is a saturated cycloalkane with the formula C{num_carbons_product}H{num_hydrogens_product}.\")\nprint(f\"The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) is calculated as: C + 1 - H/2\")\nprint(f\"IHD = {num_carbons_product} + 1 - ({num_hydrogens_product}/2) = {int(ihd_product)}\")\nprint(\"\\nThis IHD value of 1 corresponds to the single ring structure remaining in the product.\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing this to the given options:\")\nprint(\"A) 3\")\nprint(\"B) 1\")\nprint(\"C) 5\")\nprint(\"D) 0\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe correct choice is B, as the calculated IHD is {int(ihd_product)}.\")\n```\n<<<B>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The reaction involves the complete reduction of 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\nThe reactant has multiple double bonds (C=C and C=O) and a ring.\nRed P and excess HI reduce all double bonds but do not open the ring.\nThe number of carbon atoms in the product is 10.\nThe product is a saturated cycloalkane with the formula C10H20.\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) is calculated as: C + 1 - H/2\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 1\n\nThis IHD value of 1 corresponds to the single ring structure remaining in the product.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\nA) 3\nB) 1\nC) 5\nD) 0\n\nThe correct choice is B, as the calculated IHD is 1.\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure and molecular formula of the starting material.**\n\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**.\n\n*   **Parent structure:** `cyclohex-3-ene`. This is a six-membered carbon ring with one double bond between carbon-3 and carbon-4.\n*   **Principal functional group:** `carboxylic acid` (-COOH). This is at position 1.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   `2-formyl`: An aldehyde group (-CHO) is at position 2.\n    *   `5-vinyl`: A vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) is at position 5.\n\nLet's determine the molecular formula by counting the atoms:\n*   **Carbon (C):**\n    *   6 carbons in the cyclohexane ring.\n    *   1 carbon in the carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   1 carbon in the formyl group (-CHO).\n    *   2 carbons in the vinyl group (-CH=CH₂).\n    *   Total Carbons = 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):**\n    *   On the ring: C1(H), C2(H), C3(H), C4(H), C5(H), C6(H₂). Total = 7 H.\n    *   In the -COOH group: 1 H.\n    *   In the -CHO group: 1 H.\n    *   In the -CH=CH₂ group: 3 H.\n    *   Total Hydrogens = 7 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12.\n*   **Oxygen (O):**\n    *   2 oxygens in the -COOH group.\n    *   1 oxygen in the -CHO group.\n    *   Total Oxygens = 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nThe molecular formula of the starting material is **C₁₀H₁₂O₃**.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Calculate the IHD of the starting material for verification.**\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, is calculated using the formula: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2). (Oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation).\nIHD (start) = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 11 - 6 = 5.\nThis IHD of 5 can be accounted for by:\n*   1 for the ring structure.\n*   1 for the C=C double bond in the cyclohexene ring.\n*   1 for the C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group.\n*   1 for the C=O double bond in the formyl group.\n*   1 for the C=C double bond in the vinyl group.\nTotal = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5. This confirms our structure is correct.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction and determine the structure of the product.**\n\nThe reagent is **Red Phosphorus and excess of HI**.\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a very strong reducing agent. It is known for the complete reduction of most oxygen-containing functional groups and carbon-carbon multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated alkanes.\n*   **Effect on functional groups:**\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   The formyl group (-CHO) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   The vinyl group's double bond (-CH=CH₂) will be saturated to an ethyl group (-CH₂-CH₃).\n    *   The double bond within the cyclohexene ring will be saturated to a single bond, converting the ring to a cyclohexane ring.\n\n**Product Structure:**\nThe product will be a cyclohexane ring with the following substituents:\n*   A methyl group (-CH₃) at position 1.\n*   A methyl group (-CH₃) at position 2.\n*   An ethyl group (-CH₂-CH₃) at position 5.\nThe product is **5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane**.\n\n**Careful Point 2: The reaction leads to a fully saturated hydrocarbon, except for the ring.**\nThe term \"excess HI\" implies that the reaction goes to completion, reducing all possible sites. The cyclic structure of the alkane remains intact.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the molecular formula of the product.**\n\nThe product is a substituted cycloalkane.\n*   **Carbon (C):** The number of carbon atoms is conserved.

Since the product is a substituted cyclohexane, which has one ring and no double or triple bonds, an IHD of 1 is the expected value.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation:**\n1.  The starting material is C₁₀H₁₂O₃.\n2.  The reaction with Red P / excess HI reduces all C=C, C=O bonds and removes all oxygen atoms, converting the molecule into a saturated cycloalkane.\n3.

The IHD of a molecule with the formula C₁₀H₂₀ is 1.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactant**\n\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's determine its structure and molecular formula.\n*   **Parent structure**: `cyclohex-3-ene` is a six-membered carbon ring with one double bond.\n*   **Functional Groups**:\n    *   A `carboxylic acid` (-COOH) group. By convention, this is at position C1.\n    *   A `formyl` (-CHO) group at position C2.\n    *   A `vinyl` (-CH=CH2) group at position C5.\n\nFrom this structure, we can determine the molecular formula:\n*   **Carbon (C)**: 6 in the ring + 1 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO + 2 in the vinyl group = 10 carbons.\n*   **Hydrogen (H)**: 7 on the ring + 1 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO + 3 in the vinyl group = 12 hydrogens.\n*   **Oxygen (O)**: 2 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO = 3 oxygens.\nThe molecular formula of the reactant is **C10H12O3**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI (hydroiodic acid)**. This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. It performs the following reductions:\n*   Reduces aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) completely to their corresponding alkanes (-CH3).\n*   Reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n*   Removes all oxygen atoms from the molecule.\n\nIn essence, the reaction saturates all multiple bonds and removes all heteroatoms, converting the molecule into a saturated hydrocarbon while preserving the carbon skeleton (including the ring).\n\n**3. Determine the Product**\n\nApplying the effects of the reaction to the starting material:\n*   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring is reduced to a `cyclohexane` ring (the C=C bond is saturated).\n*   The `-COOH` group at C1 is reduced to a `-CH3` group.\n*   The `-CHO` group at C2 is reduced to a `-CH3` group.\n*   The `-CH=CH2` (vinyl) group at C5 is reduced to an ethyl group (`-CH2CH3`).\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane. Since all double bonds and oxygen atoms are removed, the product is a saturated monocyclic alkane. The carbon count remains 10. The general formula for a saturated monocyclic alkane is CnH2n. Therefore, the molecular formula of the product is **C10H20**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe IHD (also known as the degree of unsaturation) represents the number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule. It can be calculated from the molecular formula or the structure.\n\n*   **Method 1: From the structure**\n    The product is a substituted cyclohexane. It has one ring and zero pi bonds.\n    IHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π-bonds) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\n*   **Method 2: From the molecular formula (C10H20)**\n    The formula for IHD for a hydrocarbon (CxHy) is: IHD = C - H/2 + 1.\n    IHD = 10 - (20 / 2) + 1\n    IHD = 10 - 10 + 1\n    IHD = 1\n\nBoth methods yield an IHD of 1. This value corresponds to the single ring present in the final saturated molecule.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product, we must first identify the starting material and the product of the reaction.\n\n### 1.

The Reaction and the Product\n\nThe reactant is treated with red phosphorus (Red P) and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination is a very powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. It is known to reduce various functional groups completely to their corresponding alkanes.\n\n*   The **carboxylic acid group** (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The **formyl group** (-CHO) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The **carbon-carbon double bond** in the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a single bond.\n*   The **carbon-carbon double bond** in the vinyl group is reduced to a single bond, converting the vinyl group into an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n\nThe reaction removes all oxygen atoms and saturates all double bonds, leaving a saturated hydrocarbon with the same carbon skeleton. The starting molecule has a 10-carbon skeleton (a 6-carbon ring with three substituents containing a total of 4 carbons).\n\nThe resulting product is a substituted cyclohexane: **4-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane**.\n\n### 3. Molecular Formula of the Product\n\nThe product, 4-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane, is a saturated cycloalkane. The general formula for a cycloalkane is CₙH₂ₙ. Since the carbon skeleton has 10 carbon atoms (n=10), the molecular formula of the product is **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\n### 4. Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, indicates the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The formula for calculating IHD for a hydrocarbon (CₓHᵧ) is:\n\nIHD = (2x + 2 - y) / 2\n\nFor the product C₁₀H₂₀:\n*   x = 10 (number of carbon atoms)\n*   y = 20 (number of hydrogen atoms)\n\nIHD = (2 * 10 + 2 - 20) / 2\nIHD = (20 + 2 - 20) / 2\nIHD = 2 / 2\nIHD = 1\n\nAn IHD of 1 corresponds to the single ring structure of the cyclohexane molecule.\n\nTherefore, the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nTo determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product, we first need to understand the starting material and the reaction it undergoes.\n\n**1. The Reactant: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**\n\nLet's break down the structure to determine its molecular formula:\n*   **Cyclohex-3-ene:** A six-membered carbon ring with one double bond.\n*   **Carboxylic acid:** A -COOH group is at position 1.\n*   **Formyl:** A -CHO (aldehyde) group is at position 2.\n*   **Vinyl:** A -CH=CH2 group is at position 5.\n\nThe molecular formula of the reactant is C10H12O3. We can calculate its IHD to verify the structure's features:\n*   IHD = C + 1 - (H/2) = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 5.\n*   This corresponds to one ring, one double bond in the ring, one double bond in the vinyl group, one C=O in the formyl group, and one C=O in the carboxylic acid group (1+1+1+1+1 = 5).\n\n**2. The Reaction: Reduction with Red Phosphorus and Excess HI**\n\nThe combination of red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI) is a powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce a wide range of oxygen-containing functional groups and unsaturated bonds to their corresponding saturated alkanes.\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The formyl group (-CHO) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The carbon-carbon double bond in the cyclohexene ring will be reduced to a single bond.\n*   The carbon-carbon double bond in the vinyl group will be reduced, converting the vinyl group into an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n\n**3. The Product**\n\nThe reaction completely removes all oxygen atoms and saturates all double bonds, without breaking the carbon ring. The carbon skeleton of the reactant (C10) remains intact. The final product is a saturated cycloalkane with the following structure:\n*   A cyclohexane ring.\n*   A methyl group at position 1 (from the original carboxylic acid).\n*   A methyl group at position 2 (from the original formyl group).\n*   An ethyl group at position 5 (from the original vinyl group).\n\nThe resulting molecule is a substituted cyclohexane. The general formula for a cycloalkane is CnH2n. Since the product has 10 carbon atoms, its molecular formula will be C10H20.\n\n**4. Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe IHD, also known as the degree of unsaturation, can be calculated from the molecular formula using the formula: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2).\n\nFor the product C10H20:\n*   IHD = 10 + 1 - (20/2)\n*   IHD = 11 - 10\n*   IHD = 1\n\nAn IHD of 1 indicates the presence of either one ring or one double bond. Since the product is a fully saturated cycloalkane (1-ethyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohexane, based on IUPAC naming of the product), the IHD of 1 corresponds to the single ring in its structure.\n\nTherefore, the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product, we must first understand the reaction that takes place.\n\n**1. The Reactant and Reagents:**\n*   **Reactant:** 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (P) and excess hydroiodic acid (HI).\n\n**2. The Reaction:**\nThe combination of red phosphorus and excess HI is a powerful reducing agent. This mixture is known to completely reduce several oxygen-containing functional groups to their corresponding alkanes. Specifically:\n*   Carboxylic acid groups (-COOH) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH3).\n*   Aldehyde groups (-CHO) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH3).\n*   This reagent also reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (alkenes) to single bonds (alkanes).\n\n**3. Structure and Molecular Formula of the Reactant:**\nLet's break down the name to determine the structure and formula of the starting material:\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene:** A six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4.\n*   **carboxylic acid:** A -COOH group, which by convention is at position 1.\n*   **2-formyl:** A -CHO group at position 2.\n*   **5-vinyl:** A -CH=CH2 group at position 5.\n\nFrom this structure, we can deduce the molecular formula:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 in the ring + 1 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO + 2 in the vinyl group = 10 carbons.\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO = 3 oxygens.\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** After accounting for all the bonds, the formula is C10H12O3.\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) for the reactant is 5, calculated as follows:\nIHD = C + 1 - (H/2) = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 5.\nThis corresponds to one ring, one double bond in the ring, one double bond in the vinyl group, one C=O in the carboxylic acid, and one C=O in the formyl group (1+1+1+1+1 = 5).\n\n**4. Structure and Molecular Formula of the Product:**\nThe reaction with red P and excess HI will cause the following reductions:\n*   The carboxylic acid at C1 becomes a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The formyl group at C2 becomes a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The double bond in the cyclohexene ring is saturated.\n*   The double bond in the vinyl group is saturated, converting it to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n\nThe final product is a saturated, substituted cyclohexane ring. The carbon skeleton remains, so the product will have 10 carbon atoms. Since all double bonds are saturated and all oxygen atoms are removed, the resulting molecule is a cycloalkane. The general formula for a monocyclic alkane is CnH2n.\n\nTherefore, the molecular formula of the product is C10H20.\n\n**5. Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product:**\nThe IHD is a measure of the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. It can be calculated from the molecular formula:\nIHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\nFor the product (C10H20):\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\nThe IHD of 1 corresponds to the presence of the single ring in the cyclohexane structure.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThe reaction of 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid with red phosphorus and excess HI is a complete reduction reaction. This powerful reducing agent converts all oxygen-containing functional groups and carbon-carbon multiple bonds into their corresponding saturated alkane forms, while preserving the carbon skeleton.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactant's Carbon Skeleton:**\n    *   The reactant is named \"2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid\".\n    *   The core structure is a 6-carbon ring (`cyclohex`).\n    *   There is a 1-carbon substituent from the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`).\n    *   There is a 1-carbon substituent from the formyl group (`-CHO`).\n    *   There is a 2-carbon substituent from the vinyl group (`-CH=CH₂`).\n    *   Total number of carbon atoms = 6 (ring) + 1 (acid) + 1 (formyl) + 2 (vinyl) = 10 carbons.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Transformation:**\n    *   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring (which has one C=C double bond) is reduced to a `cyclohexane` ring (all C-C single bonds).\n    *   The `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) is reduced to a `methyl` group (-CH₃).\n    *   The `formyl` group (-CHO) is reduced to a `methyl` group (-CH₃).\n    *   The `vinyl` group (-CH=CH₂) is reduced to an `ethyl` group (-CH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Determine the Product's Structure and Formula:**\n    *   The product is a fully saturated hydrocarbon containing a single ring structure. It is a substituted cyclohexane.\n    *   Since the product is a monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane) with 10 carbon atoms, its molecular formula follows the general formula for cycloalkanes, which is CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   Therefore, the molecular formula of the product is C₁₀H₂₀.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product:**\n    The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), or degree of unsaturation, indicates the number of rings and/or π-bonds in a molecule.\n    *   **Method 1: By Structure:** The product is a substituted cyclohexane. It has one ring and zero π-bonds. Therefore, the IHD = 1.\n    *   **Method 2: By Formula (IHD = C - H/2 + 1):**\n        *   For the product C₁₀H₂₀:\n        *   IHD = 10 - (20 / 2) + 1\n        *   IHD = 10 - 10 + 1\n        *   IHD = 1\n\nBoth methods yield an IHD of 1. This single degree of unsaturation is due to the presence of the cyclohexane ring.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactant Molecule**\n\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down its structure to understand its components and calculate its initial index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD), although this is not strictly required to find the answer.\n\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: This is a six-membered carbon ring containing one double bond.\n    *   The ring itself contributes 1 to the IHD.\n    *   The double bond (C=C) within the ring contributes another 1 to the IHD.\n*   **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**: This functional group contains a carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   The C=O double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **formyl (-CHO)**: This is an aldehyde group, which also contains a carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   The C=O double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **vinyl (-CH=CH2)**: This substituent contains a carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   The C=C double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n\nSo, the total IHD of the reactant is 1 (ring) + 1 (ring C=C) + 1 (acid C=O) + 1 (aldehyde C=O) + 1 (vinyl C=C) = 5.\n\nLet's also determine the molecular formula of the reactant to be thorough.\n*   The carbon skeleton is a 6-membered ring, a carbon in the -COOH group, a carbon in the -CHO group, and two carbons in the vinyl group. Total Carbons (C) = 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10.\n*   The product will be a saturated hydrocarbon, so the number of carbons (10) is the most important piece of information from the reactant's structure.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\nThe reagent used is **red phosphorus and excess of HI (Red P + HI)**. This is a very powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. Its key functions are:\n*   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) and triple bonds to single bonds (C-C).\n*   It reduces oxygen-containing functional groups completely to the corresponding hydrocarbon.\n    *   Aldehydes (-CHO) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH3).\n    *   Ketones (>C=O) are reduced to methylene groups (>CH2).\n    *   Carboxylic acids (-COOH) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH3).\n    *   Alcohols (-OH) are reduced to alkanes (-H).\n*   Crucially, this reaction does not break the carbon skeleton, including any rings.\n\n**3. Determine the Structure and Formula of the Product**\n\nApplying the effects of Red P + HI to our reactant:\n*   The **cyclohex-3-ene** ring will have its double bond reduced, becoming a **cyclohexane** ring. The ring structure itself remains.\n*   The **carboxylic acid** group will be reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH3).\n*   The **formyl** group will be reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH3).\n*   The **vinyl** group will have its double bond reduced, becoming an **ethyl group** (-CH2CH3).\n\nThe final product is a saturated hydrocarbon. It consists of the original 10-carbon skeleton but with all double bonds saturated and all oxygen atoms removed. The structure is a substituted cyclohexane.\n\nSince the product is a saturated hydrocarbon with a single ring (a monocyclic alkane or cycloalkane) and has 10 carbon atoms, we can determine its molecular formula. The general formula for a cycloalkane is **CnH2n**.\nFor our product with n=10, the molecular formula is **C10H20**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, can be calculated in two ways for the product.\n\n*   **Method 1: Using the molecular formula**\n    The formula for IHD for a hydrocarbon C_c H_h is:\n    IHD = c - h/2 + 1\n    For the product C10H20:\n    IHD = 10 - (20 / 2) + 1\n    IHD = 10 - 10 + 1\n    IHD = 1\n\n*   **Method 2: Based on the structure**\n    The IHD is the sum of the number of rings and the number of pi (π) bonds in the molecule.\n    *   Number of rings in the product = 1 (the cyclohexane ring).\n    *   Number of π bonds in the product = 0 (it is a fully saturated hydrocarbon).\n    IHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds)\n    IHD = 1 + 0\n    IHD = 1\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactant and its Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)**\n\nFirst, let's determine the structure and the initial degree of unsaturation (IHD) of the starting material: **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. The IHD is a count of the number of rings and π (pi) bonds in a molecule.\n\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: This part of the name tells us there is a six-membered ring (which contributes 1 to the IHD) and one carbon-carbon double bond within that ring (which contributes another 1 to the IHD).\n*   **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**: This functional group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), which adds 1 to the IHD.\n*   **formyl (-CHO)**: This aldehyde group also contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), adding 1 to the IHD.\n*   **vinyl (-CH=CH₂)**: This substituent contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), adding 1 to the IHD.\n\nSumming these contributions, the total IHD of the reactant is:\nIHD_reactant = 1 (for the ring) + 1 (for the C=C in the ring) + 1 (for the C=O in the acid) + 1 (for the C=O in the aldehyde) + 1 (for the C=C in the vinyl group) = **5**.\n\n**2. Understand the Reaction**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess of HI (Red P + HI)**. This reagent combination is known as a very powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. Its function is to perform a complete reduction, meaning it:\n*   Reduces all oxygen-containing functional groups (like carboxylic acids, aldehydes, ketones, alcohols) completely to their corresponding alkane parts (e.g., -COOH and -CHO both become -CH₃).\n*   Reduces all carbon-carbon double and triple bonds to single bonds (saturates the molecule).\n\n**3. Determine the Product's Structure**\n\nThe reaction will transform the starting material into a fully saturated hydrocarbon, while keeping the carbon skeleton intact.\n*   The **cyclohexene** ring will be reduced to a **cyclohexane** ring (the C=C bond is saturated).\n*   The **carboxylic acid** group (-COOH) will be reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n*   The **formyl** group (-CHO) will be reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n*   The **vinyl** group (-CH=CH₂) will be reduced to an **ethyl group** (-CH₂CH₃).\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane. It is a **saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe IHD of the final product is calculated based on its structure using the formula:\nIHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds)\n\n*   **Number of rings**: The product still contains the six-membered cyclohexane ring. Therefore, the number of rings is **1**.\n*   **Number of π bonds**: The complete reduction has eliminated all double bonds (both C=C and C=O). Therefore, the number of π bonds is **0**.\n\nSo, the IHD of the product is:\nIHD_product = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\nThe final product has an index of hydrogen deficiency of 1, which is entirely due to the presence of the ring structure.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product is 1.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Reactant:** The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Its molecular formula is C₁₀H₁₂O₃.\n2.  **Reagent and Reaction:** The reagent is red phosphorus with an excess of hydroiodic acid (Red P/HI). This is a very powerful reducing agent that performs the following transformations:\n    *   Reduces all oxygen-containing functional groups (like carboxylic acids and aldehydes) completely to alkanes. The -COOH and -CHO groups are both reduced to -CH₃ groups.\n    *   Reduces all carbon-carbon double bonds (alkenes) to single bonds (alkanes). The double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the vinyl group are both saturated.\n    *   The reaction does not break the carbon ring structure.\n3.  **Product:** The reaction removes all double bonds and all oxygen atoms, leaving a saturated hydrocarbon that retains the original ring structure.\n    *   The `cyclohex-3-ene` core becomes a `cyclohexane` ring.\n    *   The `carboxylic acid` group becomes a `methyl` group.\n    *   The `formyl` group becomes a `methyl` group.\n    *   The `vinyl` group becomes an `ethyl` group.\n    *   The final product is a substituted cyclohexane. Since the carbon skeleton is preserved, the product has 10 carbon atoms. As it is a saturated monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane), its general formula is CₙH₂ₙ. Therefore, the molecular formula of the product is C₁₀H₂₀.\n4.  **Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) Calculation:** The IHD (also known as the degree of unsaturation) represents the number of rings and/or pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n    *   **Method 1: From the structure.** The product is a cyclohexane derivative. It has one ring and no π bonds. Therefore, IHD = 1 (for the ring) + 0 (for π bonds) = 1.\n    *   **Method 2: From the molecular formula (C₁₀H₂₀).** The formula for IHD is `IHD = C + 1 - (H/2)`, where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens.\n        IHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2) = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\nBoth methods confirm that the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the structure and molecular formula of the reactant.\n\nThe reactant is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Cyclohex-3-ene**: A six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4.\n*   **Carboxylic acid**: A -COOH group, which we'll place at position 1.\n*   **2-formyl**: A -CHO group at position 2.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A -CH=CH2 group at position 5.\n\nThe carbon skeleton consists of the 6-carbon ring, 1 carbon in the carboxylic acid, 1 carbon in the formyl group, and 2 carbons in the vinyl group, for a total of 10 carbon atoms.\n\nThe molecular formula for 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is C₁₀H₁₂O₃.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the reaction conditions.\n\nThe reactant is treated with red phosphorus (P) and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI).

The carbon skeleton is C₁₀. Since all double bonds are saturated and all oxygen atoms are removed, the product is a cycloalkane.\n\nThe general formula for a cycloalkane is CₙH₂ₙ. For a C₁₀ cycloalkane, the formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, can be calculated from the molecular formula or by examining the structure.\n\n**Method 1: Using the IHD Formula**\nThe formula for IHD is: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\nFor the product C₁₀H₂₀:\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2)\nIHD = 11 - 10\nIHD = 1\n\n**Method 2: Analyzing the Structure**\nThe IHD is the sum of the number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n*   The product has one ring (the cyclohexane ring).\n*   The product has zero double or triple bonds.\nTherefore, the IHD = 1 (for the ring) + 0 (for pi bonds) = 1.\n\nBoth methods yield an IHD of 1.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product, we must first identify the reactant and the product of the specified reaction.\n\n### 1.

This is a very powerful reducing agent known for the complete reduction of most oxygen-containing functional groups and multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated alkanes.\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The formyl group (-CHO) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   All carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) are reduced to single bonds (C-C).\n\nThe reaction will not, however, break the stable cycloalkane ring.\nSo, in the product:\n*   The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring (the C=C is reduced).\n*   The -COOH at C1 becomes a -CH₃ group.\n*   The -CHO at C2 becomes a -CH₃ group.\n*   The vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) at C5 becomes an ethyl group (-CH₂-CH₃).\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane: **1-ethyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohexane**. It is a saturated monocyclic alkane.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product.**\n\nWe can calculate the IHD of the product in two ways:\n\n*   **Method 1: Based on structural changes.**\n    The reaction reduces all four pi bonds in the starting material to single bonds. The ring structure remains intact.\n    IHD of product = IHD of starting material - (number of pi bonds reduced)\n    IHD of product = 5 - 4 = **1**.\n    The remaining IHD of 1 is due to the presence of the cyclohexane ring.\n\n*   **Method 2: Based on the product's structure/formula.**\n    The product is 1-ethyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohexane.\n    A molecule's IHD is the sum of its rings and pi bonds.\n    *   Number of rings = 1\n    *   Number of pi bonds = 0 (it is a fully saturated molecule)\n    IHD of product = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n    Alternatively, we can find the molecular formula of the product. The total number of carbons is 10 (6 from the ring + 2 from ethyl + 1 from one methyl + 1 from the other methyl). Since it is a monocyclic alkane, its general formula is CₙH₂ₙ. For n=10, the formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n    Using the IHD formula: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\n    IHD = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 11 - 10 = **1**.\n\nAll methods consistently yield an IHD of 1 for the final product.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0\nB) 5\nC) 1\nD) 3\n\nThe correct answer is 1.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nTo determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product, we must first understand the reaction that takes place.\n\n### 1. The Reactant and Reagents\n*   **Reactant:** 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (Red P) and excess hydroiodic acid (HI).\n\n### 2. The Reaction\nThe combination of red phosphorus and excess HI is a powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. It is known for the complete reduction of various oxygen-containing functional groups to their corresponding alkanes. This includes:\n*   Carboxylic acids (-COOH) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH3).\n*   Aldehydes (-CHO) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH3).\n*   Ketones (>C=O) are reduced to methylene groups (>CH2).\n*   Alcohols (-OH) are reduced to hydrogens (-H).\nFurthermore, this reagent also reduces carbon-carbon double and triple bonds to single bonds.\n\n### 3. Structure and Formula of the Reactant\nLet's break down the reactant's name to determine its structure:\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene:** A six-membered ring with a double bond between the 3rd and 4th carbon atoms.\n*   **-carboxylic acid:** A -COOH group, which we'll place at position 1.\n*   **2-formyl:** A -CHO group at position 2.\n*   **5-vinyl:** A -CH=CH2 group at position 5.\n\nThe molecular formula of 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is C10H12O3.\n\n### 4. The Product\nThe reaction with red P and excess HI will reduce all the functional groups and double bonds:\n*   The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring.\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) becomes a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The formyl group (-CHO) becomes a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The vinyl group (-CH=CH2) becomes an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n\nThe carbon skeleton of the molecule remains, but all double bonds (C=C and C=O) are saturated, and all oxygen atoms are removed. The initial C10 molecule is converted into a C10 cycloalkane. A cycloalkane with a single ring has the general formula CnH2n. Therefore, the product has the molecular formula **C10H20**.\n\n### 5. Calculating the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, indicates the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The formula for IHD is:\n\nIHD = C - (H/2) + (N/2) + 1\n\nWhere:\n*   C is the number of carbon atoms.\n*   H is the number of hydrogen atoms.\n*   N is the number of nitrogen atoms.\n\nFor our product with the formula C10H20:\n*   C = 10\n*   H = 20\n*   N = 0\n\nIHD = 10 - (20/2) + 0 + 1\nIHD = 10 - 10 + 1\nIHD = 1\n\nAn IHD of 1 corresponds to the presence of a single ring in the now fully saturated molecule (an alkyl-substituted cyclohexane).\n\nTherefore, the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nMy plan is to solve this problem by first understanding the chemical transformation and then calculating the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the resulting product.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactant:** The starting molecule is \"2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid\". I will determine its carbon skeleton and functional groups. It has a C6 ring (cyclohexene), a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), a formyl (aldehyde) group (-CHO), and a vinyl group (-CH=CH2). The total number of carbon atoms is 10.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction:** The reagent is \"red phosphorus and excess of HI\". This is one of the most powerful reducing agents in organic chemistry. It reduces almost all oxygen-containing functional groups (like aldehydes and carboxylic acids) and all multiple bonds (like C=C double bonds) completely to their corresponding saturated alkane parts.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product's Structure:** The reaction will convert the cyclohexene ring to a cyclohexane ring, the formyl group to a methyl group, the carboxylic acid group to a methyl group, and the vinyl group to an ethyl group. The result is a saturated hydrocarbon that retains the original six-membered ring. The product is a substituted cyclohexane with a total of 10 carbon atoms.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD):** The IHD (or degree of unsaturation) is a count of how many rings and pi (π) bonds are in a molecule. The formula is `IHD = (Number of Rings) + (Number of π bonds)`.\n    *   Since the product is a substituted **cyclohexane**, it has **one ring**.\n    *   Since the reaction reduces all double bonds, the product is fully saturated and has **zero π bonds**.\n    *   Therefore, the IHD of the product will be 1 + 0 = 1.\n\n5.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script that codifies this logic, calculates the IHD based on the product's structural features (1 ring, 0 pi bonds), and prints the final answer corresponding to the given multiple-choice options.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) for the product of a specific chemical reaction.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: Define the reaction and its effect.\n    # The reaction of 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid with red phosphorus and excess HI\n    # is a complete reduction.

Let's break down the name to determine its structure and key features:\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: This is the parent structure, a six-membered ring with a double bond between carbon 3 and carbon 4.\n*   **carboxylic acid**: A -COOH group is present. By convention, this is placed at position C1.\n*   **2-formyl**: A -CHO (aldehyde) group is attached to C2.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A -CH=CH2 group is attached to C5.\n\nThe structure contains several features that contribute to the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD), which is a measure of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds.\n*   One ring (the cyclohexene ring).\n*   One carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) within the ring.\n*   One carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) in the vinyl group.\n*   One carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O) in the carboxylic acid group.\n*   One carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O) in the formyl group.\n\nThe IHD of the starting material is the sum of these features: 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C in ring) + 1 (C=C in vinyl) + 1 (C=O in COOH) + 1 (C=O in CHO) = 5.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the chemical reaction.**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI)**. This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. Its key function is to perform a complete reduction on oxygen-containing functional groups and carbon-carbon multiple bonds.\n\nHere's how it affects the functional groups in our starting material:\n*   **Carboxylic acid group (-COOH)**: It gets fully reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   **Formyl group (-CHO)**: It gets fully reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   **Carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C)**: Both the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the vinyl group are reduced to single bonds (C-C). The vinyl group (-CH=CH2) becomes an ethyl group (-CH2-CH3).\n*   **The ring structure itself remains intact.**\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of the product.**\n\nThe reaction preserves the carbon skeleton but removes all multiple bonds and oxygen atoms, replacing them with hydrogen atoms until the molecule is fully saturated.\n*   The **cyclohex-3-ene** ring becomes a **cyclohexane** ring (a saturated ring).\n*   The **carboxylic acid** group at C1 becomes a **methyl** group.\n*   The **formyl** group at C2 becomes a **methyl** group.\n*   The **vinyl** group at C5 becomes an **ethyl** group.\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane.

This compound is treated with red phosphorus (P) and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI).\n\n2.  **The Reaction**: The combination of red phosphorus and excess HI is a powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. This reagent is capable of reducing multiple functional groups completely to their corresponding alkanes. Specifically:\n    *   Aldehyde groups (-CHO) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH3).\n    *   Carboxylic acid groups (-COOH) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH3).\n    *   Carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C), like those in the cyclohexene ring and the vinyl group, are saturated to become single bonds (C-C).\n    *   The red phosphorus serves to regenerate the HI from the iodine (I2) that is formed during the reaction, allowing the reduction to go to completion.\n\n3.  **Determining the Product's Structure**:\n    *   The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The carboxylic acid at position 1 becomes a methyl group.\n    *   The formyl group at position 2 becomes a methyl group.\n    *   The vinyl group (-CH=CH2) at position 5 is reduced to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n\n    Therefore, the final product is **1-ethyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohexane**.\n\n4.  **Determining the Molecular Formula of the Product**:\n    *   The cyclohexane ring has 6 carbon atoms.\n    *   The ethyl group has 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   The two methyl groups have 1 carbon atom each.\n    *   Total carbons = 6 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 10 carbons.\n    *   A saturated acyclic alkane with 10 carbons would have the formula C10H(2*10 + 2) = C10H22.\n    *   Since the product has one ring, two hydrogen atoms are removed.\n    *   Therefore, the molecular formula of the product is **C10H20**.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)**: The IHD, also known as the degree of unsaturation, indicates the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. It can be calculated from the molecular formula or by examining the structure.\n\n    *   **From the structure**: The product, 1-ethyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohexane, contains one ring and no double or triple bonds. A ring counts as one unit of hydrogen deficiency. Therefore, the IHD is 1.\n\n    *   **From the formula (CxHy)**: The IHD can be calculated using the formula: IHD = x - (y/2) + 1.\n        For the product C10H20:\n        IHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1\n        IHD = 10 - 10 + 1\n        IHD = 1\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the final product is 1.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nThe problem asks for the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product formed when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is treated with red phosphorus and an excess of hydriodic acid (HI).\n\n### Step 1: Determine the structure and formula of the starting material.\nThe starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Cyclohex-3-ene**: A six-membered ring with a double bond between carbon 3 and carbon 4.\n*   **-carboxylic acid**: A -COOH group is at position 1.\n*   **2-formyl**: A -CHO group is at position 2.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A -CH=CH₂ group is at position 5.\n\nLet's determine its molecular formula:\n*   Carbons (C): 6 in the ring + 1 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO + 2 in -CH=CH₂ = 10 carbons (C₁₀).\n*   Oxygens (O): 2 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO = 3 oxygens (O₃).\n*   Hydrogens (H): Let's count them on the structure.\n    *   Ring H's: H at C1, H at C2, H at C3, H at C4, H at C5, 2H at C6 = 7 H.\n    *   -COOH H: 1 H.\n    *   -CHO H: 1 H.\n    *   -CH=CH₂ H's: 3 H.\n    *   Total H = 7 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12 hydrogens (H₁₂).\nThe molecular formula of the starting material is C₁₀H₁₂O₃.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the reaction and identify the product.\nThe reagent used is red phosphorus (P) and excess hydriodic acid (HI). This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce various functional groups completely to their corresponding alkanes.\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The aldehyde group (-CHO) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   Carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C), like those in the cyclohexene ring and the vinyl group, are also reduced to single bonds (alkanes).\n\nApplying these transformations to the starting material:\n*   The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring.\n*   The carboxylic acid at C1 becomes a methyl group.\n*   The formyl group at C2 becomes a methyl group.\n*   The vinyl group at C5 becomes an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n\nThe final product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-ethylcyclohexane. This is a saturated cycloalkane with substituents.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the molecular formula of the product.\nThe reaction is a reduction, meaning oxygen atoms are removed and hydrogen atoms are added. The carbon skeleton remains the same (10 carbon atoms). The product is a saturated hydrocarbon with one ring.\n\nThe general formula for an acyclic alkane is CₙH₂ₙ₊₂. For a C₁₀ acyclic alkane, the formula would be C₁₀H₂₂. The presence of a single ring reduces the hydrogen count by two. Therefore, the molecular formula for a C₁₀ cycloalkane is C₁₀H₂₀.\n\nThe product, 1,2-dimethyl-4-ethylcyclohexane, is a cycloalkane containing a total of 10 carbon atoms, so its formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product.\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), or degree of unsaturation, indicates the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The formula for IHD for a hydrocarbon (CₐHₑ) is:\n\nIHD = a - (b/2) + 1\n\nFor the product with the formula C₁₀H₂₀:\nIHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1\nIHD = 10 - 10 + 1\nIHD = 1\n\nThis result is consistent with the structure of the product, which is a cyclohexane ring (one ring) with no double or triple bonds. The single ring accounts for an IHD of 1.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nTo determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product, we first need to understand the starting material and the reaction it undergoes.\n\n### 1. The Reactant: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid\n\nLet's break down the structure:\n*   **Cyclohex-3-ene**: A six-membered carbon ring with one double bond between carbons 3 and 4.\n*   **Carboxylic acid**: A -COOH group, which we'll place at carbon 1.\n*   **2-formyl**: A -CHO (aldehyde) group at carbon 2.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A -CH=CH₂ group at carbon 5.\n\nThe molecular formula for this reactant is C₁₀H₁₂O₃.\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency (also known as degrees of unsaturation) for the reactant can be calculated from its structure:\n*   One ring = 1\n*   One C=C bond in the ring = 1\n*   One C=C bond in the vinyl group = 1\n*   One C=O bond in the formyl group = 1\n*   One C=O bond in the carboxylic acid group = 1\n*   **Total IHD for reactant = 5**\n\n### 2. The Reaction: Reduction with Red Phosphorus and Excess HI\n\nRed phosphorus in the presence of excess hydroiodic acid (HI) is a very powerful reducing agent. This reagent is known to reduce a wide variety of functional groups completely down to the corresponding alkane.\n\nSpecifically, for the functional groups present in our reactant:\n*   **Carboxylic acid (-COOH)** is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   **Aldehyde (-CHO)** is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   **Alkenes (C=C)** are reduced to alkanes (C-C).\n\n### 3. The Product\n\nThe reaction will cause the following transformations:\n*   The cyclohexene ring will be reduced to a cyclohexane ring (the C=C bond is saturated).\n*   The carboxylic acid group at position 1 will become a methyl group.\n*   The formyl group at position 2 will become a methyl group.\n*   The vinyl group at position 5 will be reduced to an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n\nTherefore, the final product is a saturated cycloalkane with three alkyl substituents: 1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane (the numbering is based on the reactant for clarity). This is a saturated molecule containing a single ring.\n\n### 4. Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product\n\nThe IHD is a count of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n*   **Rings:** The product, 1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane, contains one cyclohexane ring. This accounts for an IHD of 1.\n*   **Pi (π) bonds:** The reduction process eliminates all double bonds (C=C and C=O) that were present in the reactant. The final product is a saturated alkane, meaning it has no double or triple bonds.\n\nThus, the only contribution to the IHD of the product is the single ring structure.\n\n**IHD of product = 1 (for the ring) + 0 (for pi bonds) = 1**\n\nThe molecular formula of the product is C₁₀H₂₀. We can verify the IHD using the formula IHD = C - H/2 + 1:\nIHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1 = 10 - 10 + 1 = 1.\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the final product is 1.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\n**1.

Let's break down its structure to understand its components and calculate its initial index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD).\n\n*   **Cyclohex-3-ene**: This is a six-membered ring containing one carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   A ring contributes 1 to the IHD.\n    *   The double bond (C=C) contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **Carboxylic acid (-COOH)**: This functional group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n    *   This double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **Formyl (-CHO)**: This is an aldehyde group, which also contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n    *   This double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **Vinyl (-CH=CH2)**: This substituent contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n    *   This double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n\n**Initial IHD of the reactant:**\nSumming up all contributions:\nIHD = (1 for the ring) + (1 for the C=C in the ring) + (1 for the C=O in carboxylic acid) + (1 for the C=O in the formyl group) + (1 for the C=C in the vinyl group) = **5**.\n\nAlternatively, we can determine the molecular formula and calculate the IHD from it.\n*   The structure is C6H5(COOH)(CHO)(C2H3).\n*   Carbons (C): 6 (ring) + 1 (acid) + 1 (aldehyde) + 2 (vinyl) = 10\n*   Hydrogens (H): Let's count them on the structure `C1(-COOH)-C2(-CHO)-C3H=C4H-C5H(-CH=CH2)-C6H2-`.\n    *   H on ring carbons: 1(on C1) + 1(on C2) + 1(on C3) + 1(on C4) + 1(on C5) + 2(on C6) = 7 H.\n    *   H on functional groups: 1(in COOH) + 1(in CHO) + 3(in vinyl) = 5 H.\n    *   Total H = 7 + 5 = 12.\n*   Oxygens (O): 2 (in COOH) + 1 (in CHO) = 3.\n*   Molecular formula of reactant: **C10H12O3**.\n\nNow, calculate IHD using the formula `IHD = C + 1 - H/2`:\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 11 - 6 = **5**. This confirms our structural analysis.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\nThe reagent used is **red phosphorus and an excess of HI (Red P + HI)**. This is a very strong reducing agent. Its effect is to reduce nearly all oxygen-containing functional groups and unsaturations (double/triple bonds) to their corresponding saturated alkane forms.\n\n*   **Alkene reduction**: All C=C bonds will be reduced to C-C single bonds.\n*   **Carbonyl reduction**: Both the aldehyde (-CHO) and carboxylic acid (-COOH) groups will be fully reduced to methyl (-CH3) groups.\n*   **Ring stability**: The cyclohexane ring itself is stable and will not be opened under these conditions.\n\n**3. Determine the Product**\n\nThe reaction will proceed as follows:\n*   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring.\n*   The `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) at position 1 becomes a `methyl` group (-CH3).\n*   The `formyl` group (-CHO) at position 2 becomes a `methyl` group (-CH3).\n*   The `vinyl` group (-CH=CH2) at position 5 becomes an `ethyl` group (-CH2CH3).\n\nThe resulting product is a substituted cyclohexane (specifically, 4-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane, though the exact IUPAC name is not required). The key takeaway is that the product is a **saturated cycloalkane**. It contains a single ring but has no double or triple bonds.\n\n**4. Calculate the IHD of the Product**\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) is the sum of the number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n\n*   **Rings**: The product has one cyclohexane ring. Contribution = 1.\n*   **Pi bonds**: The product is fully saturated, meaning it has no double or triple bonds. Contribution = 0.\n\n**Final IHD of the product = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = 1.**\n\nAlternatively, we can determine the molecular formula of the product. The carbon skeleton is conserved (C=10). The product is a saturated monocyclic alkane, so its general formula is CnH2n.\n*   Molecular formula of the product: **C10H20**.\n\nNow, calculate IHD using the formula:\nIHD = C + 1 - H/2 = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 11 - 10 = **1**.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the structure and properties of the reactant.**\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down the name to understand its structure:\n*   **cyclohex**: A six-membered carbon ring.\n*   **-3-ene**: A double bond (C=C) between carbon 3 and carbon 4 of the ring.\n*   **carboxylic acid**: A -COOH group. By convention, this is at position 1.\n*   **2-formyl**: A -CHO group (an aldehyde) at position 2.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A -CH=CH2 group at position 5.\n\nThe structure contains several features that contribute to the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as degrees of unsaturation. The IHD is a count of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n\nLet's count the sources of unsaturation in the reactant:\n1.  **The ring structure**: 1 degree of unsaturation.\n2.  **The C=C double bond in the ring** (cyclohex-3-ene): 1 degree of unsaturation.\n3.  **The C=C double bond in the vinyl group** (-CH=CH2): 1 degree of unsaturation.\n4.  **The C=O double bond in the formyl group** (-CHO): 1 degree of unsaturation.\n5.  **The C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group** (-COOH): 1 degree of unsaturation.\n\nSo, the total Index of Hydrogen Deficiency for the reactant is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n\nTo confirm, let's determine the molecular formula of the reactant: C10H12O3.\nUsing the IHD formula: IHD = C + 1 - H/2 - X/2 + N/2\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 11 - 6 = 5. This confirms our structural analysis.\n\n### **Step 2: Understand the chemical reaction.**\n\nThe reagent used is **red phosphorus and excess of HI** (Red P + HI). This is a very powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. Its key function is to reduce various oxygen-containing functional groups and multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated alkanes.\n\nSpecifically, Red P + HI will:\n*   Reduce aldehydes (-CHO) to methyl groups (-CH3).\n*   Reduce carboxylic acids (-COOH) to methyl groups (-CH3).\n*   Reduce C=C double bonds to C-C single bonds.\n\nEssentially, this reaction will saturate all double bonds (both C=C and C=O) and remove all oxygen atoms, converting the molecule to its parent hydrocarbon while preserving the carbon skeleton.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the structure and properties of the product.**\n\nThe reaction will act on the reactant as follows:\n*   The C=C bond in the cyclohexene ring will be reduced to a C-C bond.\n*   The C=C bond in the vinyl group will be reduced, converting the vinyl group (-CH=CH2) into an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n*   The formyl group (-CHO) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n\nThe initial carbon skeleton (a 6-membered ring with three substituents) is preserved. The final product will be a substituted **cyclohexane** (a saturated ring). All the pi bonds from the original functional groups and unsaturations will be gone.\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of the product.**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency is the sum of rings and pi bonds.\n*   The product still contains the six-membered ring. This contributes **1** to the IHD.\n*   All the pi bonds (C=C and C=O) in the reactant have been reduced to single bonds. Therefore, there are no more pi bonds in the product.\n\nThe only remaining source of hydrogen deficiency in the product is the ring itself.\nSo, the IHD of the product = 1 (for the ring) + 0 (for pi bonds) = 1.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the molecular formula of the product.\nThe reactant is C10H12O3. The product is the corresponding saturated hydrocarbon, which is a substituted cyclohexane. A monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane with no other rings or double bonds) has the general formula CnH2n. Since the carbon count is 10, the product's formula is C10H20.\n\nLet's calculate the IHD for C10H20:\nIHD = C + 1 - H/2\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (20/2)\nIHD = 11 - 10\nIHD = 1\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.

Let's count its sources of unsaturation (rings and π bonds) to determine its IHD.\n\n*   **Rings:** The molecule has a `cyclohexene` ring, which counts as **1** unit of deficiency.\n*   **π Bonds:**\n    1.  One C=C double bond within the `cyclohex-3-ene` ring.\n    2.  One C=C double bond in the `vinyl` group (-CH=CH₂).\n    3.  One C=O double bond in the `formyl` group (-CHO).\n    4.  One C=O double bond in the `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH).\n    This gives a total of **4** π bonds.\n\nThe total IHD of the reactant is the sum of rings and π bonds:\nIHD_reactant = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds) = 1 + 4 = 5.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Chemical Reaction**\n\nThe reagent used is **red phosphorus and excess HI (Red P + HI)**. This is a very powerful reducing agent known for the complete reduction of oxygen-containing functional groups and carbon-carbon multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated alkane forms.\n\nThe reaction will cause the following changes:\n*   The C=C double bond in the ring will be reduced to a C-C single bond.\n*   The C=C double bond in the vinyl group will be reduced to a C-C single bond.\n*   The formyl group (-CHO) and the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) will be fully reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n\nEssentially, all π bonds in the molecule are eliminated, but the ring structure remains.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Product's Structure and IHD**\n\nThe reaction removes all sources of unsaturation except for the ring itself.\n*   The product is a substituted **cyclohexane** (a saturated ring).\n*   All functional groups and multiple bonds on the side chains have been reduced to their saturated forms.\n\nNow, let's calculate the IHD of the final product:\n*   **Number of rings:** The cyclohexane ring is preserved, so there is **1 ring**.\n*   **Number of π bonds:** All C=C and C=O bonds have been reduced to single bonds. There are **0 π bonds** left.\n\nThe IHD of the product is:\nIHD_product = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1, which corresponds to the single ring in the molecule.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 0\nB) 5\nC) 3\nD) 1\n\nThe correct answer is 1.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1.

One carbon-oxygen double bond in the carboxylic acid group (-COOH): IHD = 1\n\nAdding these up, the total IHD of the reactant is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n\nFor confirmation, let's find the molecular formula of the reactant and calculate its IHD.\n*   Carbons (C): 6 in the ring + 1 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO + 2 in -CH=CH2 = 10 carbons.\n*   Hydrogens (H): 1 on C1, 1 on C2, 1 on C3, 1 on C4, 1 on C5, 2 on C6, 1 in -COOH, 1 in -CHO, 3 in -CH=CH2. Total H = 1+1+1+1+1+2+1+1+3 = 12 hydrogens.\n*   Oxygens (O): 2 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO = 3 oxygens.\nThe molecular formula is **C10H12O3**.\nThe IHD formula is: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2). (Oxygen atoms do not affect the IHD calculation).\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 11 - 6 = 5. This matches our structural analysis.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the reaction and determine the product's structure.**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess of HI**. This is a very powerful reducing agent known for the complete reduction of most oxygen-containing functional groups and multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated alkane forms.\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The formyl group (-CHO) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The carbon-carbon double bond in the ring is reduced to a single bond (hydrogenated).\n*   The carbon-carbon double bond in the vinyl group is reduced to a single bond (the vinyl group becomes an ethyl group, -CH2CH3).\n\nThe carbon skeleton, including the ring, remains intact. The reaction removes all pi bonds and oxygen atoms, converting the molecule into a saturated hydrocarbon.\n\nThe product will be a substituted **cyclohexane** (since the ring C=C is reduced). The substituents will be two methyl groups and one ethyl group. The carbon skeleton is C10.\nThe product is a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product.**\n\nThe IHD of a molecule is the sum of its rings and pi bonds.\nThe product is a substituted cyclohexane.\n*   Number of rings = 1\n*   Number of pi bonds (C=C, C≡C, C=O, etc.) = 0 (since it is a fully saturated alkane)\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the product is 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the molecular formula of the product.\nThe product is a saturated monocyclic alkane with 10 carbon atoms. The general formula for a monocyclic alkane is CnH2n.\nSo, the molecular formula of the product is **C10H20**.\nUsing the IHD formula:\nIHD = C + 1 - (H/2) = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\nBoth methods give the same result. The index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) 3\nB) 1\nC) 0\nD) 5\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a step-by-by-step analysis to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency of the final product.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Reactant\n\nThe starting compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's break down its structure to find its molecular formula:\n*   **Cyclohex-3-ene**: A six-membered carbon ring with one double bond.\n*   **Carboxylic acid**: A -COOH group. Let's assume it's at position 1.\n*   **2-formyl**: A -CHO (aldehyde) group at position 2.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A -CH=CH₂ group at position 5.\n\nThe molecular formula for this structure is C₁₀H₁₂O₃.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Reaction\n\nThe reactant is treated with red phosphorus (P) and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination is an extremely powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. Its primary function is to reduce various oxygen-containing functional groups and unsaturated bonds to their corresponding alkanes.\n\nSpecifically, this reagent will cause the following reductions:\n*   **Carboxylic acid (-COOH)** is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   **Aldehyde (-CHO)** is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   **Alkene (C=C)** bonds (both in the ring and the vinyl group) are reduced to single bonds (C-C).\n\nEssentially, every double bond and all oxygen atoms are removed, and the molecule is fully saturated with hydrogen.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Product's Structure and Formula\n\nThe reaction reduces all functional groups and double bonds, but it does not break the carbon ring. The carbon skeleton remains intact.\n\n*   The `cyclohexene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring.\n*   The `carboxylic acid` at position 1 becomes a `methyl` group.\n*   The `formyl group` at position 2 becomes a `methyl` group.\n*   The `vinyl group` at position 5 becomes an `ethyl` group.\n\nThe original molecule had 10 carbon atoms, and since no carbons are lost, the product will also have 10 carbon atoms. The product is a fully saturated, substituted cycloalkane. A saturated hydrocarbon with a single ring (a cycloalkane) has the general formula CₙH₂ₙ.\n\nGiven that our product has 10 carbon atoms (n=10), its molecular formula will be **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, indicates the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The formula for IHD is:\n\nIHD = C - (H/2) + (N/2) + 1\n\nWhere C is the number of carbon atoms, H is the number of hydrogen atoms, and N is the number of nitrogen atoms.\n\nFor our product with the formula **C₁₀H₂₀**:\n*   C = 10\n*   H = 20\n*   N = 0\n\nIHD = 10 - (20/2) + 0 + 1\nIHD = 10 - 10 + 1\nIHD = 1\n\nThis IHD of 1 corresponds to the single ring structure of the cyclohexane backbone. All other forms of unsaturation (double bonds from the original alkene, aldehyde, and carboxylic acid groups) have been eliminated.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the final product:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactant:** The starting molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. We first need to determine its carbon skeleton.\n    *   `cyclohex`: A 6-carbon ring.\n    *   `carboxylic acid`: Adds 1 carbon (-COOH).\n    *   `formyl`: Adds 1 carbon (-CHO).\n    *   `vinyl`: Adds 2 carbons (-CH=CH2).\n    *   The total number of carbon atoms in the molecule is 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10.\n\n2.  **Understand the Reaction:** The reagent is red phosphorus with an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination is a powerful reducing agent known for the complete reduction of almost all oxygen-containing functional groups and carbon-carbon multiple bonds to their corresponding alkanes.\n    *   The `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   The `formyl` group (-CHO) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   The `vinyl` group's double bond (-CH=CH2) will be reduced to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n    *   The `cyclohexene` ring's double bond will be reduced to a single bond, resulting in a `cyclohexane` ring.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product:** The reaction will preserve the original carbon skeleton but will remove all oxygen atoms and saturate all multiple bonds. The product will be a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon with 10 carbon atoms (a substituted cyclohexane).\n\n4.  **Calculate the IHD of the Product:** The general molecular formula for a saturated monocyclic alkane (like a substituted cyclohexane) is CnH2n. Since our product has 10 carbon atoms (n=10), its molecular formula will be C10H20.

The Reaction\n\nThe combination of red phosphorus and excess HI is a powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce a wide variety of functional groups completely to their corresponding alkanes. This includes:\n*   Aldehydes (-CHO) to alkyl groups (-CH3).\n*   Carboxylic acids (-COOH) to alkyl groups (-CH3).\n*   Ketones (C=O) to methylene groups (-CH2-).\n*   Alkenes (C=C) and alkynes (C≡C) to alkanes.\n*   Alcohols (-OH) to alkanes.\n\nIn this reaction, all points of unsaturation and all oxygen-containing functional groups will be removed and reduced to a saturated hydrocarbon.\n\n### 3.

An example isomer would be 1-ethyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohexane. The initial carbon skeleton of 10 carbon atoms is retained. The product is a saturated cycloalkane.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as degrees of unsaturation, can be calculated from the molecular formula using the following equation:\n\nIHD = C - (H/2) + (N/2) + 1\n\nWhere C is the number of carbon atoms, H is the number of hydrogen atoms, and N is the number of nitrogen atoms. Oxygen and halogens do not affect the IHD calculation in this form of the formula.\n\n*   **Product Molecular Formula:** The product is a saturated cycloalkane with 10 carbon atoms (C10). A saturated, non-cyclic alkane would have the formula CnH(2n+2). A saturated cycloalkane with one ring has the formula CnH(2n). Therefore, the molecular formula of our product is C10H20.\n\n*   **IHD Calculation:**\n    *   IHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1\n    *   IHD = 10 - 10 + 1\n    *   IHD = 1\n\nAlternatively, the IHD can be found by simply counting the number of rings and π-bonds in the structure. The final product is a substituted cyclohexane, which contains one ring and no π-bonds. Therefore, its IHD is 1.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Structure and Formula of the Reactant\n\nThe starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Cyclohex-3-ene**: A six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between C3 and C4.\n*   **-carboxylic acid**: A -COOH group is attached to C1 of the ring.\n*   **2-formyl**: A -CHO group is attached to C2 of the ring.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A -CH=CH₂ group is attached to C5 of the ring.\n\nBased on this structure, the molecular formula is C₁₀H₁₂O₃.\n\nLet's verify the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) for the reactant to confirm its structure.\nThe IHD is calculated by the formula: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2), ignoring oxygen atoms.\nIHD (reactant) = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 11 - 6 = 5.\n\nThis IHD of 5 corresponds to:\n*   1 for the ring structure.\n*   1 for the double bond in the cyclohexene ring.\n*   1 for the double bond in the vinyl group.\n*   1 for the C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid.\n*   1 for the C=O double bond in the formyl group.\nThe calculation confirms the structure is correct.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Reaction and the Product\n\nThe reactant is treated with red phosphorus (P) and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination is a powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce most oxygen-containing functional groups, as well as carbon-carbon multiple bonds, to alkanes.\n\nThe reaction will proceed as follows:\n*   The **carboxylic acid group** (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The **formyl group** (-CHO) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The **vinyl group** (-CH=CH₂) is reduced to an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n*   The **carbon-carbon double bond** within the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a single bond.\n\nTherefore, the starting molecule is completely reduced to a substituted cyclohexane. The final product is 5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Molecular Formula of the Product\n\nThe product is 5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane. Let's find its molecular formula:\n*   **Cyclohexane ring**: C₆H₁₂.\n*   Three hydrogens on the ring are substituted with:\n    *   One methyl group (-CH₃)\n    *   Another methyl group (-CH₃)\n    *   One ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)\n*   **Total carbons**: 6 (from ring) + 1 (from first methyl) + 1 (from second methyl) + 2 (from ethyl) = 10 carbons.\n*   **Total hydrogens**: A saturated acyclic alkane with 10 carbons has the formula C₁₀H₂₂. Since the product has one ring, two hydrogens are subtracted. Thus, the formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (also known as degrees of unsaturation) indicates the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule.\n\nThe IHD can be determined from the molecular formula C₁₀H₂₀:\n*   IHD = (2C + 2 - H) / 2\n*   IHD = (2 * 10 + 2 - 20) / 2\n*   IHD = (20 + 2 - 20) / 2\n*   IHD = 2 / 2 = 1\n\nAlternatively, the IHD can be found by inspecting the structure of the product, 5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane. The molecule consists of a single cyclohexane ring and contains no double or triple bonds. A ring counts as one degree of unsaturation.\n\nTherefore, the index of hydrogen deficiency of the final product is 1.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nTo determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the final product, we must first understand the starting material and the nature of the chemical reaction.\n\n### 1. The Reactant and its Structure\n\nThe starting compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's break down its structure to find its molecular formula:\n*   **Cyclohex-3-ene:** A six-membered carbon ring with one double bond.\n*   **Carboxylic acid (-COOH):** This group contains one carbon, two oxygens, and one hydrogen. Let's assume it is at position 1 of the ring.\n*   **Formyl group (-CHO):** An aldehyde group containing one carbon, one oxygen, and one hydrogen, located at position 2.\n*   **Vinyl group (-CH=CH₂):** An alkene group with two carbons and three hydrogens, located at position 5.\n\nBased on this structure, the molecular formula is **C₁₀H₁₂O₃**.\n\nWe can calculate the IHD of the reactant to verify the structure. The formula for IHD is:\nIHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 11 - 6 = 5\n\nThis IHD of 5 corresponds to:\n*   1 for the ring structure.\n*   1 for the double bond within the ring (cyclohex-3-ene).\n*   1 for the double bond in the vinyl group.\n*   1 for the carbonyl double bond (C=O) in the formyl group.\n*   1 for the carbonyl double bond (C=O) in the carboxylic acid group.\n\n### 2. The Reaction\n\nThe reagent used is red phosphorus (Red P) with an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination is a very strong reducing agent. It is known to reduce various functional groups completely to alkanes:\n*   **Aldehydes and Ketones:** The carbonyl group (C=O) is reduced to a methylene group (-CH₂-), and a terminal aldehyde like the formyl group (-CHO) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   **Carboxylic Acids:** The carboxyl group (-COOH) is completely reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   **Alkenes and Alkynes:** Carbon-carbon double and triple bonds are reduced to single bonds.\n*   **Alcohols:** The hydroxyl group (-OH) is replaced by a hydrogen atom.\n\nThe role of red phosphorus is to regenerate HI from the iodine (I₂) that is formed during the reaction, thus allowing the reaction to go to completion.\n\n### 3. The Product\n\nGiven the potent reducing power of Red P + HI, all the functional groups and unsaturations in the reactant molecule will be reduced:\n*   The **carboxylic acid** at position 1 becomes a **methyl group**.\n*   The **formyl group** at position 2 becomes a **methyl group**.\n*   The **double bond in the cyclohexene ring** is saturated, forming a **cyclohexane ring**.\n*   The **vinyl group** at position 5 is reduced to an **ethyl group** (-CH₂CH₃).\n\nTherefore, the final product is **1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane**.\n\n### 4.

A ring itself contributes 1 to the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD).\n    *   `...-3-ene...`: The 'ene' indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) within the ring. This double bond adds another 1 to the IHD.\n    *   `...carboxylic acid`: This is a -COOH functional group. It contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This double bond adds 1 to the IHD.\n    *   `2-formyl...`: A formyl group is an aldehyde, -CHO. It also contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This adds 1 to the IHD.\n    *   `5-vinyl...`: A vinyl group is -CH=CH2. It contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). This adds another 1 to the IHD.\n\n2.  **Calculate the IHD of the Reactant (Optional but helpful):**\n    *   IHD from the ring: 1\n    *   IHD from C=C in the ring: 1\n    *   IHD from C=O in the acid: 1\n    *   IHD from C=O in the aldehyde: 1\n    *   IHD from C=C in the vinyl group: 1\n    *   Total IHD of the reactant = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction:** The reactant is treated with \"red phosphorus and excess of HI\". This is a very powerful reducing agent used in organic chemistry.\n    *   **Effect on Functional Groups:** This reagent is known for its ability to reduce most oxygen-containing functional groups completely to the corresponding hydrocarbon part.\n        *   Carboxylic acids (-COOH) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH3).\n        *   Aldehydes (-CHO) are also reduced to methyl groups (-CH3).\n    *   **Effect on Double Bonds:** It also reduces (saturates) carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n    *   **Overall Transformation:** Essentially, the reaction removes all pi bonds (both C=C and C=O) and all oxygen atoms from the molecule, leaving behind a saturated hydrocarbon skeleton.\n\n4.  **Determine the Structure of the Product:**\n    *   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring (the C=C is reduced).\n    *   The `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) is reduced, leaving its carbon attached to the ring.\n    *   The `formyl` group (-CHO) is reduced, leaving its carbon attached to the ring.\n    *   The `vinyl` group (-CH=CH2) becomes an `ethyl` group (-CH2-CH3) as its C=C bond is reduced.\n    *   The final product is a substituted cyclohexane. It's a fully saturated molecule (no double or triple bonds).\n\n5.  **Calculate the IHD of the Product:**\n    *   The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, is calculated as: IHD = (Number of Rings) + (Number of Pi Bonds).\n    *   In the product molecule:\n        *   **Number of Rings:** The six-membered ring structure is preserved. So, Number of Rings = 1.\n        *   **Number of Pi Bonds:** All double bonds (C=C and C=O) from the original molecule were reduced to single bonds. So, Number of Pi Bonds = 0.\n    *   Therefore, the IHD of the product = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\n6.  **Match with Options:** The calculated IHD is 1.

Let's break down its structure to identify all sources of unsaturation (rings and pi bonds).\n*   **cyclohex-**: This indicates a six-membered ring structure. A ring contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **-3-ene**: This indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) within the ring. A double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A vinyl group is -CH=CH₂, which contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). This double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **2-formyl**: A formyl group is an aldehyde (-CHO), which contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **carboxylic acid**: A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This double bond also contributes 1 to the IHD.\n\nSo, the total IHD of the starting material is 1 (ring) + 1 (ring C=C) + 1 (vinyl C=C) + 1 (formyl C=O) + 1 (carboxyl C=O) = 5.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the chemical reaction.**\nThe reagent used is **red phosphorus and excess of HI (hydroiodic acid)**. This is a very strong reducing agent. It is known for its ability to reduce almost all oxygen-containing functional groups and multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated hydrocarbon (alkane) form.\nThe effects of Red P / excess HI are:\n*   It reduces alkene double bonds (C=C) to alkane single bonds (C-C).\n*   It completely reduces aldehydes (-CHO) to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   It completely reduces carboxylic acids (-COOH) to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   It does not break the carbon-carbon single bonds that form the skeleton of the molecule, including the ring structure.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of the product.**\nApplying the effects of the reagent to our reactant:\n1.  The **cyclohex-3-ene** ring will be reduced to a **cyclohexane** ring (the C=C double bond becomes a C-C single bond).\n2.  The **vinyl group** (-CH=CH₂) will be reduced to an **ethyl group** (-CH₂-CH₃).\n3.  The **formyl group** (-CHO) at position 2 will be reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n4.  The **carboxylic acid group** (-COOH) at position 1 will be reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane. Specifically, it is 5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane. The key point is that it is a saturated cycloalkane; all double bonds have been eliminated.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product.**\nThe IHD (or degree of unsaturation) is calculated as:\nIHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds)\n\nFor the final product (a substituted cyclohexane):\n*   **Number of rings**: The cyclohexane ring is still present. So, the number of rings is 1.\n*   **Number of pi bonds**: The reaction has reduced all C=C and C=O double bonds to single bonds. Therefore, the number of pi bonds in the product is 0.\n\nTotal IHD of the product = 1 (from the ring) + 0 (from pi bonds) = 1.\n\n**Summary of careful points:**\n*   Correctly identify all sources of unsaturation in the starting material (one ring, two C=C bonds, two C=O bonds).\n*   Recognize that Red P/HI is a powerful reducing agent that reduces all these unsaturations except for the ring structure itself.\n*   Understand that the final product is a saturated cycloalkane, which means it has no pi bonds but retains its single ring.\n*   Recall that the IHD is the sum of rings and pi bonds. A simple cycloalkane will always have an IHD of 1.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\nIHD_product = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency of the final product.\n\n**1.

So, x = 10.\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 in COOH + 1 in CHO = 3 oxygens.

Analyze the reaction conditions.**\n\n*   The reactant is treated with **red phosphorus (Red P) and excess hydroiodic acid (HI)**.\n*   This combination is a very powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. Its primary functions are:\n    *   Reduction of aldehydes and ketones to alkanes.\n    *   Reduction of carboxylic acids to alkanes.\n    *   Reduction of alcohols to alkanes.\n    *   Reduction of carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) and triple bonds to single bonds (C-C).\n    *   Removal of all oxygen atoms from the functional groups mentioned above.\n\n**3. Determine the structure and molecular formula of the product.**\n\n*   The reaction will reduce all the unsaturation and oxygen-containing functional groups in the starting molecule.\n*   The **C=C double bond** in the cyclohexene ring will be reduced to a C-C single bond.\n*   The **C=C double bond** in the vinyl group will be reduced, converting the vinyl group (-CH=CH2) into an ethyl group (-CH2-CH3).\n*   The **formyl group** (-CHO) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The **carboxylic acid group** (-COOH) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   All oxygen atoms will be eliminated.\n*   The initial C10 carbon skeleton remains, but it becomes fully saturated.\n*   The product is a substituted cyclohexane ring. It is a saturated cycloalkane containing 10 carbon atoms.\n*   The general formula for a cycloalkane (an alkane with one ring) is **CnH2n**.\n*   Since our product has 10 carbon atoms (n=10), its molecular formula is **C10H(2*10) = C10H20**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the final product.**\n\n*   The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, tells us the sum of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n*   The formula for IHD for a molecule with formula CxHy is: **IHD = C - (H/2) + 1**.\n*   For our product with the formula **C10H20**:\n    *   IHD = 10 - (20 / 2) + 1\n    *   IHD = 10 - 10 + 1\n    *   IHD = 1\n\n*   This result is consistent with the structure of the product. The product is a substituted cyclohexane, which contains one ring (IHD = 1) and no double or triple bonds.\n\nTherefore, the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\nTo determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product, we first need to understand the starting material and the reaction it undergoes.\n\n### 1. The Reactant and its IHD\n\nThe starting compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's determine its molecular formula and IHD.\n*   **Cyclohexene ring**: A six-membered ring with one double bond. This contributes 1 (for the ring) + 1 (for the double bond) = 2 to the IHD.\n*   **Carboxylic acid group (-COOH)**: Contains one C=O double bond, contributing 1 to the IHD.\n*   **Formyl group (-CHO)**: Contains one C=O double bond, contributing 1 to the IHD.\n*   **Vinyl group (-CH=CH2)**: Contains one C=C double bond, contributing 1 to the IHD.\n\nThe total IHD of the reactant is the sum of these contributions: 1 (ring) + 1 (ring C=C) + 1 (carboxyl C=O) + 1 (formyl C=O) + 1 (vinyl C=C) = 5.\n\nAlternatively, we can determine its molecular formula:\n*   Carbons (C): 6 (in the ring) + 1 (from -COOH) + 1 (from -CHO) + 2 (from -CH=CH2) = 10 carbons.\n*   Oxygens (O): 2 (from -COOH) + 1 (from -CHO) = 3 oxygens.\n*   Hydrogens (H): By drawing the structure and counting, we find there are 12 hydrogens.\n*   The molecular formula is C₁₀H₁₂O₃.\n\nThe IHD can be calculated using the formula: IHD = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1 (where O does not affect the calculation).\nIHD = 10 - (12/2) + 1 = 10 - 6 + 1 = 5.\n\n### 2. The Reaction\n\nThe reagent used is red phosphorus with an excess of hydroiodic acid (Red P + excess HI). This is a very powerful reducing agent known for the complete reduction of several oxygen-containing functional groups and carbon-carbon multiple bonds. Specifically:\n*   Carboxylic acids (-COOH) are reduced to alkanes (-CH₃).\n*   Aldehydes (-CHO) are reduced to alkanes (-CH₃).\n*   Carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) are reduced to single bonds (C-C).\n\n### 3. The Product and its IHD\n\nApplying this to our reactant:\n*   The -COOH group is reduced to a -CH₃ group, removing the C=O double bond (IHD change of -1).\n*   The -CHO group is reduced to a -CH₃ group, removing the C=O double bond (IHD change of -1).\n*   The C=C double bond within the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a C-C single bond (IHD change of -1).\n*   The C=C double bond in the vinyl group is reduced to a C-C single bond, converting it to an ethyl group (IHD change of -1).\n\nThe original cyclohexane ring structure remains. A ring itself corresponds to an IHD of 1. Since all the double bonds (both C=O and C=C) have been removed, the only feature contributing to the IHD in the final product is the cyclohexane ring.\n\nThe final product is 1-ethyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohexane. Its molecular formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n\nLet's calculate the IHD for the product:\n*   Using the structure: The product is a cycloalkane, which contains one ring and no double or triple bonds. Therefore, its IHD is 1.\n*   Using the molecular formula (C₁₀H₂₀): IHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1 = 10 - 10 + 1 = 1.\n\nThus, the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nTo determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the final product, we must first understand the starting material and the nature of the chemical reaction.\n\n### 1.

The Reaction\n\nThe reactant is treated with red phosphorus (P) and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination is a powerful reducing agent. Its effects on the functional groups present in the starting molecule are as follows:\n*   It reduces carboxylic acids completely to alkanes (R-COOH → R-CH₃).\n*   It reduces aldehydes completely to alkanes (R-CHO → R-CH₃).\n*   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (alkenes) to single bonds (C=C → C-C).\n\n### 3. The Product\n\nApplying these reductions to the starting material:\n*   The carboxylic acid group becomes a methyl group.\n*   The formyl group becomes a methyl group.\n*   The double bond within the cyclohexene ring is saturated.\n*   The double bond in the vinyl group is saturated, converting it to an ethyl group.\n\nThe original cyclohexane ring structure remains, but all double bonds and oxygen-containing groups are removed. The final product is a saturated substituted cyclohexane. Specifically, it is 1-ethyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohexane (the exact numbering can vary with IUPAC nomenclature, but the molecular formula is key).\n\nThe product has 10 carbon atoms (no carbons are lost). Since it's a saturated cycloalkane, its general formula is CₙH₂ₙ. Therefore, the molecular formula of the product is **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\n### 4. Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) Calculation\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (also known as degrees of unsaturation) indicates the total number of rings and π (pi) bonds in a molecule.\n\nThe formula for IHD is:\nIHD = C - (H/2) + 1\nWhere C is the number of carbon atoms and H is the number of hydrogen atoms.\n\nFor the product C₁₀H₂₀:\nIHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1\nIHD = 10 - 10 + 1\nIHD = 1\n\nThis IHD value of 1 corresponds to the single ring of the cyclohexane structure.

The molecular formula is C₁₀H₁₂O₃.\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) for the reactant can be calculated as:\nIHD = C - (H/2) + (N/2) + 1  (Oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation).\nIHD = 10 - (12/2) + 1 = 10 - 6 + 1 = 5.\nThis IHD of 5 corresponds to one ring, three double bonds (one in the ring, one in the vinyl group, one in the formyl group), and the C=O of the carboxylic acid (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5).\n\n### 2. The Reaction\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess hydroiodic acid (Red P + HI)**. This combination is a powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. It is known to reduce various functional groups to alkanes:\n*   Aldehydes (-CHO) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   Carboxylic acids (-COOH) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   Carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) are reduced to single bonds (C-C).\n\n### 3.

Understand the Reactant**\n\nThe reactant is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's break down its structure to determine its molecular formula and initial IHD.\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: This is a six-membered carbon ring with one double bond between carbons 3 and 4. A ring itself counts as one degree of unsaturation. The double bond adds another.\n*   **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**: This group is at position 1. It contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), which adds one degree of unsaturation.\n*   **formyl group (-CHO)**: This aldehyde group is at position 2. It also contains a C=O double bond, adding another degree of unsaturation.\n*   **vinyl group (-CH=CH2)**: This group is at position 5. It contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), which adds one degree of unsaturation.\n\nLet's calculate the molecular formula of the reactant:\n*   The basic cyclohexene ring (C6H10) has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 5, so we need to remove hydrogens from those positions to add the groups. Let's build the molecule systematically.\n*   Number of Carbon atoms (C):\n    *   6 in the cyclohexene ring\n    *   1 in the carboxylic acid group (-COOH)\n    *   1 in the formyl group (-CHO)\n    *   2 in the vinyl group (-CH=CH2)\n    *   Total C = 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10\n*   Number of Hydrogen atoms (H):\n    *   The unsubstituted cyclohex-3-ene ring would be C6H10. Let's count the hydrogens on the substituted ring:\n        *   C1: bonded to -COOH, C2, and C6 -> 1 H\n        *   C2: bonded to -CHO, C1, and C3 -> 1 H\n        *   C3: part of C=C, bonded to C2 and C4 -> 1 H\n        *   C4: part of C=C, bonded to C3 and C5 -> 1 H\n        *   C5: bonded to -vinyl, C4, and C6 -> 1 H\n        *   C6: bonded to C1 and C5 -> 2 H\n    *   Total H on the ring = 1+1+1+1+1+2 = 7 H.\n    *   Hydrogens in the substituents:\n        *   -COOH: 1 H\n        *   -CHO: 1 H\n        *   -CH=CH2: 3 H\n    *   Total H = 7 (ring) + 1 (acid) + 1 (aldehyde) + 3 (vinyl) = 12 H.\n*   Number of Oxygen atoms (O):\n    *   2 in the carboxylic acid group\n    *   1 in the formyl group\n    *   Total O = 2 + 1 = 3 O.\n*   The molecular formula of the reactant is **C10H12O3**.\n\nNow, let's calculate the IHD of the reactant to verify.

Oxygen does not affect the calculation.\nIHD_reactant = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 11 - 6 = 5.\n\nThis matches our structural analysis: 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C in ring) + 1 (C=C in vinyl) + 1 (C=O in acid) + 1 (C=O in aldehyde) = 5.\n\n**2. Understand the Reaction**\n\nThe reagent is red phosphorus (Red P) with an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI). This is a very powerful reducing agent.

Determine the Product**\n\nApplying the effects of Red P/HI to the reactant:\n*   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a saturated `cyclohexane` ring.\n*   The `carboxylic acid` group at C1 becomes a `methyl` group.\n*   The `formyl` group at C2 becomes a `methyl` group.\n*   The `vinyl` group at C5 becomes an `ethyl` group (-CH2CH3).\n\nThe product is a substituted cyclohexane. Let's find its molecular formula.\n*   **Carbon atoms:** The number of carbon atoms does not change during this reduction. So, the product still has **10 carbon atoms**.\n*   **Structure:** The product is a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon (an alkyl-substituted cyclohexane). The general formula for such a compound (one ring, no other unsaturation) is **CnH2n**.\n*   Since n=10, the molecular formula of the product is **C10H20**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nWe can calculate the IHD for the product in two ways:\n\n*   **Method 1: Using the molecular formula (C10H20)**\n    IHD_product = C + 1 - (H/2) = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\n*   **Method 2: Using the structure of the product**\n    The IHD is the sum of the number of rings and the number of pi (π) bonds.\n    *   Number of rings = 1 (the cyclohexane ring).\n    *   Number of π bonds = 0 (all double bonds have been reduced to single bonds).\n    *   IHD_product = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nBoth methods yield an IHD of 1 for the product.\n\n**5.

This accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n*   **`-3-ene`**: A C=C double bond within the ring. This accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n*   **`formyl` group (-CHO)**: An aldehyde group, which contains a C=O double bond. This accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n*   **`vinyl` group (-CH=CH₂)**: Contains a C=C double bond. This accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n*   **`carboxylic acid` group (-COOH)**: Contains a C=O double bond. This accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n\nThe total IHD of the reactant is 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C in ring) + 1 (C=O in aldehyde) + 1 (C=C in vinyl) + 1 (C=O in acid) = 5.\n\n### **2.

Analyze the Reaction**\n\nThe reagent used is **red phosphorus and excess of HI (Red P + HI)**. This is a very powerful reducing agent. Its function is to reduce various functional groups completely to their corresponding alkanes. Specifically:\n*   It reduces aldehydes (-CHO) to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   It reduces carboxylic acids (-COOH) to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n\nThe reaction will proceed as follows:\n*   The **formyl group** (-CHO) at C2 will be reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n*   The **carboxylic acid group** (-COOH) at C1 will be reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n*   The **C=C double bond** in the cyclohexene ring will be reduced to a C-C single bond, converting the cyclohexene ring into a **cyclohexane ring**.\n*   The **vinyl group** (-CH=CH₂) at C5 will be reduced to an **ethyl group** (-CH₂-CH₃).\n\n**3.

Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe IHD is a count of the rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n*   **Rings:** The product molecule contains one ring (the cyclohexane ring).\n*   **Pi Bonds:** The reaction with Red P + HI reduces all C=C and C=O double bonds to single bonds. Therefore, the product has zero pi bonds.\n\nIHD (product) = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds)\nIHD (product) = 1 + 0 = 1\n\nAlternatively, we can determine the molecular formula of the product. The starting material has 10 carbon atoms (6 in the ring, 1 in COOH, 1 in CHO, 2 in vinyl). The reduction does not change the number of carbons.

The Reactant and its Structure\n\nThe starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Cyclohex-3-ene:** A six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4.\n*   **Carboxylic acid:** A -COOH group, which we'll place at position 1.\n*   **2-formyl:** A -CHO (aldehyde) group at position 2.\n*   **5-vinyl:** A -CH=CH₂ group at position 5.\n\nThe molecular formula for this reactant is C₁₀H₁₂O₃.\n\n### 2. The Reaction\n\nThe reactant is treated with red phosphorus (P) and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination is a powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. It is known to reduce several functional groups to alkanes:\n*   **Carboxylic acids (-COOH)** are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   **Aldehydes (-CHO)** are also reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   **Alkenes (C=C)** are reduced to alkanes (C-C).\n*   **Alcohols (-OH)** are reduced to alkanes (-H).\n\nIn this reaction, all oxygen-containing functional groups and all carbon-carbon double bonds will be fully reduced.\n\n### 3. The Product\n\nThe reaction will result in the following transformations on the starting molecule:\n*   The **carboxylic acid** group at position 1 becomes a **methyl group**.\n*   The **formyl (aldehyde)** group at position 2 becomes a **methyl group**.\n*   The **carbon-carbon double bond** within the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a single bond, converting the ring to a **cyclohexane** skeleton.\n*   The **vinyl group** (-CH=CH₂) at position 5 is reduced to an **ethyl group** (-CH₂CH₃).\n\nThe carbon skeleton of the molecule, which consists of 10 carbon atoms (6 in the ring, 1 in the carboxyl group, 1 in the formyl group, and 2 in the vinyl group), remains intact. The final product is a saturated cycloalkane, specifically a disubstituted ethyl-dimethyl-cyclohexane. The exact IUPAC name (e.g., 1-ethyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohexane) is not necessary to determine the molecular formula.\n\nSince the product is a saturated monocyclic alkane with 10 carbon atoms, its general formula will be CₙH₂ₙ, which is C₁₀H₂₀.\n\n### 4. Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, indicates the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. It is calculated using the molecular formula:\n\nIHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\n\nWhere:\n*   C is the number of carbon atoms.\n*   H is the number of hydrogen atoms.\n\nFor the product with the molecular formula C₁₀H₂₀:\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2)\nIHD = 11 - 10\nIHD = 1\n\nAn IHD of 1 corresponds to the presence of a single ring in the saturated cycloalkane product.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactant:** First, we need to understand the structure of the starting material, \"2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid\", and determine its key features that contribute to the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD). The IHD (also known as the degree of unsaturation) is the sum of the number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n    *   **cyclohex**: This indicates one ring structure (IHD = 1).\n    *   **-3-ene**: This indicates one carbon-carbon double bond within the ring (IHD = 1).\n    *   **vinyl**: This is a -CH=CH2 group, which contains one carbon-carbon double bond (IHD = 1).\n    *   **formyl**: This is a -CHO group, which contains one carbon-oxygen double bond (IHD = 1).\n    *   **carboxylic acid**: This is a -COOH group, which contains one carbon-oxygen double bond (IHD = 1).\n    *   The total IHD of the reactant is 1 (ring) + 1 (ene) + 1 (vinyl) + 1 (formyl) + 1 (acid) = 5.\n\n2.  **Understand the Reaction:** The reactant is treated with red phosphorus and an excess of HI. This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. Its function is to reduce most oxygen-containing functional groups and carbon-carbon multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated alkanes.\n    *   The C=C double bond in the ring will be reduced to a C-C single bond.\n    *   The C=C double bond in the vinyl group will be reduced to a C-C single bond.\n    *   The C=O double bond in the formyl group will be reduced, and the whole group becomes a methyl (-CH3).\n    *   The C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group will be reduced, and the whole group becomes a methyl (-CH3).\n    *   Importantly, this reaction does *not* break the ring structure.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product and its IHD:** After the reaction, all the pi bonds (from C=C and C=O) are removed. The only feature contributing to the IHD that remains is the original cyclohexane ring. Therefore, the IHD of the final product is 1.\n\n4.  **Calculate using Molecular Formula (for verification):**\n    *   **Reactant:** The molecular formula is C10H12O3. IHD = C + 1 - H/2 = 10 + 1 - 12/2 = 5.\n    *   **Product:** The reaction removes all oxygen and saturates all pi bonds, without changing the number of carbons. The resulting product is a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon. The general formula for a monocyclic alkane is CnH2n. Since the product has 10 carbon atoms, its formula is C10H20.\n    *   **Product IHD Calculation:** Using the formula for the product (C10H20):\n        IHD = C + 1 - H/2 = 10 + 1 - 20/2 = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\nThe code below will perform this final calculation.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the properties of the reactant.\n# The reactant is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n# Let's determine its molecular formula.\n# Carbons (C): 6 (ring) + 1 (COOH) + 1 (CHO) + 2 (vinyl) = 10\n# The reaction with red P and excess HI is a complete reduction.\n# It reduces all C=C and C=O bonds and removes oxygen atoms, but does not break the ring.\n# The number of carbon atoms in the product remains the same.\nnum_carbons_product = 10\n\n# Step 2: Determine the molecular formula of the product.\n# The product is a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon (a substituted cycloalkane).\n# The general formula for a monocyclic alkane is C_n H_{2n}.\n# For n=10, the formula is C10H20.\nnum_hydrogens_product = 2 * num_carbons_product\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) for the product.\n# The formula for IHD is: C + 1 - (H/2)\n# where C is the number of carbon atoms and H is the number of hydrogen atoms.\nihd_product = num_carbons_product + 1 - (num_hydrogens_product / 2)\n\n# Step 4: Print the result and the corresponding choice.\nprint(\"The reaction involves the complete reduction of 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\")\nprint(\"The reactant has multiple double bonds (C=C and C=O) and a ring.\")\nprint(\"Red P and excess HI reduce all double bonds but do not open the ring.\")\nprint(f\"The number of carbon atoms in the product is {num_carbons_product}.\")\nprint(f\"The product is a saturated cycloalkane with the formula C{num_carbons_product}H{num_hydrogens_product}.\")\nprint(f\"The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) is calculated as: C + 1 - H/2\")\nprint(f\"IHD = {num_carbons_product} + 1 - ({num_hydrogens_product}/2) = {int(ihd_product)}\")\nprint(\"\\nThis IHD value of 1 corresponds to the single ring structure remaining in the product.\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing this to the given options:\")\nprint(\"A) 3\")\nprint(\"B) 1\")\nprint(\"C) 5\")\nprint(\"D) 0\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe correct choice is B, as the calculated IHD is {int(ihd_product)}.\")\n```\n<<<B>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The reaction involves the complete reduction of 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\nThe reactant has multiple double bonds (C=C and C=O) and a ring.\nRed P and excess HI reduce all double bonds but do not open the ring.\nThe number of carbon atoms in the product is 10.\nThe product is a saturated cycloalkane with the formula C10H20.\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) is calculated as: C + 1 - H/2\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 1\n\nThis IHD value of 1 corresponds to the single ring structure remaining in the product.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\nA) 3\nB) 1\nC) 5\nD) 0\n\nThe correct choice is B, as the calculated IHD is 1.\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure and molecular formula of the starting material.**\n\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**.\n\n*   **Parent structure:** `cyclohex-3-ene`.

Let's determine its structure and molecular formula.\n*   **Parent structure**: `cyclohex-3-ene` is a six-membered carbon ring with one double bond.\n*   **Functional Groups**:\n    *   A `carboxylic acid` (-COOH) group. By convention, this is at position C1.\n    *   A `formyl` (-CHO) group at position C2.\n    *   A `vinyl` (-CH=CH2) group at position C5.\n\nFrom this structure, we can determine the molecular formula:\n*   **Carbon (C)**: 6 in the ring + 1 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO + 2 in the vinyl group = 10 carbons.\n*   **Hydrogen (H)**: 7 on the ring + 1 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO + 3 in the vinyl group = 12 hydrogens.\n*   **Oxygen (O)**: 2 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO = 3 oxygens.\nThe molecular formula of the reactant is **C10H12O3**.\n\n**2.

Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, indicates the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The formula for calculating IHD for a hydrocarbon (CₓHᵧ) is:\n\nIHD = (2x + 2 - y) / 2\n\nFor the product C₁₀H₂₀:\n*   x = 10 (number of carbon atoms)\n*   y = 20 (number of hydrogen atoms)\n\nIHD = (2 * 10 + 2 - 20) / 2\nIHD = (20 + 2 - 20) / 2\nIHD = 2 / 2\nIHD = 1\n\nAn IHD of 1 corresponds to the single ring structure of the cyclohexane molecule.\n\nTherefore, the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nTo determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product, we first need to understand the starting material and the reaction it undergoes.\n\n**1. The Reactant: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**\n\nLet's break down the structure to determine its molecular formula:\n*   **Cyclohex-3-ene:** A six-membered carbon ring with one double bond.\n*   **Carboxylic acid:** A -COOH group is at position 1.\n*   **Formyl:** A -CHO (aldehyde) group is at position 2.\n*   **Vinyl:** A -CH=CH2 group is at position 5.\n\nThe molecular formula of the reactant is C10H12O3. We can calculate its IHD to verify the structure's features:\n*   IHD = C + 1 - (H/2) = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 5.\n*   This corresponds to one ring, one double bond in the ring, one double bond in the vinyl group, one C=O in the formyl group, and one C=O in the carboxylic acid group (1+1+1+1+1 = 5).\n\n**2. The Reaction: Reduction with Red Phosphorus and Excess HI**\n\nThe combination of red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI) is a powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce a wide range of oxygen-containing functional groups and unsaturated bonds to their corresponding saturated alkanes.\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The formyl group (-CHO) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The carbon-carbon double bond in the cyclohexene ring will be reduced to a single bond.\n*   The carbon-carbon double bond in the vinyl group will be reduced, converting the vinyl group into an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n\n**3. The Product**\n\nThe reaction completely removes all oxygen atoms and saturates all double bonds, without breaking the carbon ring. The carbon skeleton of the reactant (C10) remains intact. The final product is a saturated cycloalkane with the following structure:\n*   A cyclohexane ring.\n*   A methyl group at position 1 (from the original carboxylic acid).\n*   A methyl group at position 2 (from the original formyl group).\n*   An ethyl group at position 5 (from the original vinyl group).\n\nThe resulting molecule is a substituted cyclohexane. The general formula for a cycloalkane is CnH2n. Since the product has 10 carbon atoms, its molecular formula will be C10H20.\n\n**4. Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe IHD, also known as the degree of unsaturation, can be calculated from the molecular formula using the formula: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2).\n\nFor the product C10H20:\n*   IHD = 10 + 1 - (20/2)\n*   IHD = 11 - 10\n*   IHD = 1\n\nAn IHD of 1 indicates the presence of either one ring or one double bond. Since the product is a fully saturated cycloalkane (1-ethyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohexane, based on IUPAC naming of the product), the IHD of 1 corresponds to the single ring in its structure.\n\nTherefore, the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product, we must first understand the reaction that takes place.\n\n**1. The Reactant and Reagents:**\n*   **Reactant:** 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (P) and excess hydroiodic acid (HI).\n\n**2. The Reaction:**\nThe combination of red phosphorus and excess HI is a powerful reducing agent. This mixture is known to completely reduce several oxygen-containing functional groups to their corresponding alkanes. Specifically:\n*   Carboxylic acid groups (-COOH) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH3).\n*   Aldehyde groups (-CHO) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH3).\n*   This reagent also reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (alkenes) to single bonds (alkanes).\n\n**3. Structure and Molecular Formula of the Reactant:**\nLet's break down the name to determine the structure and formula of the starting material:\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene:** A six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4.\n*   **carboxylic acid:** A -COOH group, which by convention is at position 1.\n*   **2-formyl:** A -CHO group at position 2.\n*   **5-vinyl:** A -CH=CH2 group at position 5.\n\nFrom this structure, we can deduce the molecular formula:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 in the ring + 1 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO + 2 in the vinyl group = 10 carbons.\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO = 3 oxygens.\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** After accounting for all the bonds, the formula is C10H12O3.\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) for the reactant is 5, calculated as follows:\nIHD = C + 1 - (H/2) = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 5.\nThis corresponds to one ring, one double bond in the ring, one double bond in the vinyl group, one C=O in the carboxylic acid, and one C=O in the formyl group (1+1+1+1+1 = 5).\n\n**4. Structure and Molecular Formula of the Product:**\nThe reaction with red P and excess HI will cause the following reductions:\n*   The carboxylic acid at C1 becomes a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The formyl group at C2 becomes a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The double bond in the cyclohexene ring is saturated.\n*   The double bond in the vinyl group is saturated, converting it to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n\nThe final product is a saturated, substituted cyclohexane ring. The carbon skeleton remains, so the product will have 10 carbon atoms. Since all double bonds are saturated and all oxygen atoms are removed, the resulting molecule is a cycloalkane. The general formula for a monocyclic alkane is CnH2n.\n\nTherefore, the molecular formula of the product is C10H20.\n\n**5. Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product:**\nThe IHD is a measure of the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. It can be calculated from the molecular formula:\nIHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\nFor the product (C10H20):\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\nThe IHD of 1 corresponds to the presence of the single ring in the cyclohexane structure.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThe reaction of 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid with red phosphorus and excess HI is a complete reduction reaction. This powerful reducing agent converts all oxygen-containing functional groups and carbon-carbon multiple bonds into their corresponding saturated alkane forms, while preserving the carbon skeleton.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactant's Carbon Skeleton:**\n    *   The reactant is named \"2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid\".\n    *   The core structure is a 6-carbon ring (`cyclohex`).\n    *   There is a 1-carbon substituent from the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`).\n    *   There is a 1-carbon substituent from the formyl group (`-CHO`).\n    *   There is a 2-carbon substituent from the vinyl group (`-CH=CH₂`).\n    *   Total number of carbon atoms = 6 (ring) + 1 (acid) + 1 (formyl) + 2 (vinyl) = 10 carbons.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Transformation:**\n    *   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring (which has one C=C double bond) is reduced to a `cyclohexane` ring (all C-C single bonds).\n    *   The `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) is reduced to a `methyl` group (-CH₃).\n    *   The `formyl` group (-CHO) is reduced to a `methyl` group (-CH₃).\n    *   The `vinyl` group (-CH=CH₂) is reduced to an `ethyl` group (-CH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Determine the Product's Structure and Formula:**\n    *   The product is a fully saturated hydrocarbon containing a single ring structure. It is a substituted cyclohexane.\n    *   Since the product is a monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane) with 10 carbon atoms, its molecular formula follows the general formula for cycloalkanes, which is CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   Therefore, the molecular formula of the product is C₁₀H₂₀.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product:**\n    The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), or degree of unsaturation, indicates the number of rings and/or π-bonds in a molecule.\n    *   **Method 1: By Structure:** The product is a substituted cyclohexane. It has one ring and zero π-bonds. Therefore, the IHD = 1.\n    *   **Method 2: By Formula (IHD = C - H/2 + 1):**\n        *   For the product C₁₀H₂₀:\n        *   IHD = 10 - (20 / 2) + 1\n        *   IHD = 10 - 10 + 1\n        *   IHD = 1\n\nBoth methods yield an IHD of 1. This single degree of unsaturation is due to the presence of the cyclohexane ring.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactant Molecule**\n\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down its structure to understand its components and calculate its initial index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD), although this is not strictly required to find the answer.\n\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: This is a six-membered carbon ring containing one double bond.\n    *   The ring itself contributes 1 to the IHD.\n    *   The double bond (C=C) within the ring contributes another 1 to the IHD.\n*   **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**: This functional group contains a carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   The C=O double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **formyl (-CHO)**: This is an aldehyde group, which also contains a carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   The C=O double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **vinyl (-CH=CH2)**: This substituent contains a carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   The C=C double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n\nSo, the total IHD of the reactant is 1 (ring) + 1 (ring C=C) + 1 (acid C=O) + 1 (aldehyde C=O) + 1 (vinyl C=C) = 5.\n\nLet's also determine the molecular formula of the reactant to be thorough.\n*   The carbon skeleton is a 6-membered ring, a carbon in the -COOH group, a carbon in the -CHO group, and two carbons in the vinyl group. Total Carbons (C) = 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10.\n*   The product will be a saturated hydrocarbon, so the number of carbons (10) is the most important piece of information from the reactant's structure.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\nThe reagent used is **red phosphorus and excess of HI (Red P + HI)**. This is a very powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. Its key functions are:\n*   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) and triple bonds to single bonds (C-C).\n*   It reduces oxygen-containing functional groups completely to the corresponding hydrocarbon.\n    *   Aldehydes (-CHO) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH3).\n    *   Ketones (>C=O) are reduced to methylene groups (>CH2).\n    *   Carboxylic acids (-COOH) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH3).\n    *   Alcohols (-OH) are reduced to alkanes (-H).\n*   Crucially, this reaction does not break the carbon skeleton, including any rings.\n\n**3. Determine the Structure and Formula of the Product**\n\nApplying the effects of Red P + HI to our reactant:\n*   The **cyclohex-3-ene** ring will have its double bond reduced, becoming a **cyclohexane** ring. The ring structure itself remains.\n*   The **carboxylic acid** group will be reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH3).\n*   The **formyl** group will be reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH3).\n*   The **vinyl** group will have its double bond reduced, becoming an **ethyl group** (-CH2CH3).\n\nThe final product is a saturated hydrocarbon. It consists of the original 10-carbon skeleton but with all double bonds saturated and all oxygen atoms removed. The structure is a substituted cyclohexane.\n\nSince the product is a saturated hydrocarbon with a single ring (a monocyclic alkane or cycloalkane) and has 10 carbon atoms, we can determine its molecular formula. The general formula for a cycloalkane is **CnH2n**.\nFor our product with n=10, the molecular formula is **C10H20**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, can be calculated in two ways for the product.\n\n*   **Method 1: Using the molecular formula**\n    The formula for IHD for a hydrocarbon C_c H_h is:\n    IHD = c - h/2 + 1\n    For the product C10H20:\n    IHD = 10 - (20 / 2) + 1\n    IHD = 10 - 10 + 1\n    IHD = 1\n\n*   **Method 2: Based on the structure**\n    The IHD is the sum of the number of rings and the number of pi (π) bonds in the molecule.\n    *   Number of rings in the product = 1 (the cyclohexane ring).\n    *   Number of π bonds in the product = 0 (it is a fully saturated hydrocarbon).\n    IHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds)\n    IHD = 1 + 0\n    IHD = 1\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactant and its Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)**\n\nFirst, let's determine the structure and the initial degree of unsaturation (IHD) of the starting material: **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. The IHD is a count of the number of rings and π (pi) bonds in a molecule.\n\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: This part of the name tells us there is a six-membered ring (which contributes 1 to the IHD) and one carbon-carbon double bond within that ring (which contributes another 1 to the IHD).\n*   **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**: This functional group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), which adds 1 to the IHD.\n*   **formyl (-CHO)**: This aldehyde group also contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), adding 1 to the IHD.\n*   **vinyl (-CH=CH₂)**: This substituent contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), adding 1 to the IHD.\n\nSumming these contributions, the total IHD of the reactant is:\nIHD_reactant = 1 (for the ring) + 1 (for the C=C in the ring) + 1 (for the C=O in the acid) + 1 (for the C=O in the aldehyde) + 1 (for the C=C in the vinyl group) = **5**.\n\n**2. Understand the Reaction**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess of HI (Red P + HI)**. This reagent combination is known as a very powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. Its function is to perform a complete reduction, meaning it:\n*   Reduces all oxygen-containing functional groups (like carboxylic acids, aldehydes, ketones, alcohols) completely to their corresponding alkane parts (e.g., -COOH and -CHO both become -CH₃).\n*   Reduces all carbon-carbon double and triple bonds to single bonds (saturates the molecule).\n\n**3. Determine the Product's Structure**\n\nThe reaction will transform the starting material into a fully saturated hydrocarbon, while keeping the carbon skeleton intact.\n*   The **cyclohexene** ring will be reduced to a **cyclohexane** ring (the C=C bond is saturated).\n*   The **carboxylic acid** group (-COOH) will be reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n*   The **formyl** group (-CHO) will be reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n*   The **vinyl** group (-CH=CH₂) will be reduced to an **ethyl group** (-CH₂CH₃).\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane. It is a **saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe IHD of the final product is calculated based on its structure using the formula:\nIHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds)\n\n*   **Number of rings**: The product still contains the six-membered cyclohexane ring. Therefore, the number of rings is **1**.\n*   **Number of π bonds**: The complete reduction has eliminated all double bonds (both C=C and C=O). Therefore, the number of π bonds is **0**.\n\nSo, the IHD of the product is:\nIHD_product = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\nThe final product has an index of hydrogen deficiency of 1, which is entirely due to the presence of the ring structure.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product is 1.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Reactant:** The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Its molecular formula is C₁₀H₁₂O₃.\n2.  **Reagent and Reaction:** The reagent is red phosphorus with an excess of hydroiodic acid (Red P/HI). This is a very powerful reducing agent that performs the following transformations:\n    *   Reduces all oxygen-containing functional groups (like carboxylic acids and aldehydes) completely to alkanes. The -COOH and -CHO groups are both reduced to -CH₃ groups.\n    *   Reduces all carbon-carbon double bonds (alkenes) to single bonds (alkanes). The double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the vinyl group are both saturated.\n    *   The reaction does not break the carbon ring structure.\n3.  **Product:** The reaction removes all double bonds and all oxygen atoms, leaving a saturated hydrocarbon that retains the original ring structure.\n    *   The `cyclohex-3-ene` core becomes a `cyclohexane` ring.\n    *   The `carboxylic acid` group becomes a `methyl` group.\n    *   The `formyl` group becomes a `methyl` group.\n    *   The `vinyl` group becomes an `ethyl` group.\n    *   The final product is a substituted cyclohexane. Since the carbon skeleton is preserved, the product has 10 carbon atoms. As it is a saturated monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane), its general formula is CₙH₂ₙ. Therefore, the molecular formula of the product is C₁₀H₂₀.\n4.  **Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) Calculation:** The IHD (also known as the degree of unsaturation) represents the number of rings and/or pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n    *   **Method 1: From the structure.** The product is a cyclohexane derivative. It has one ring and no π bonds. Therefore, IHD = 1 (for the ring) + 0 (for π bonds) = 1.\n    *   **Method 2: From the molecular formula (C₁₀H₂₀).** The formula for IHD is `IHD = C + 1 - (H/2)`, where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens.\n        IHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2) = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\nBoth methods confirm that the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the structure and molecular formula of the reactant.\n\nThe reactant is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Cyclohex-3-ene**: A six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4.\n*   **Carboxylic acid**: A -COOH group, which we'll place at position 1.\n*   **2-formyl**: A -CHO group at position 2.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A -CH=CH2 group at position 5.\n\nThe carbon skeleton consists of the 6-carbon ring, 1 carbon in the carboxylic acid, 1 carbon in the formyl group, and 2 carbons in the vinyl group, for a total of 10 carbon atoms.\n\nThe molecular formula for 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is C₁₀H₁₂O₃.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the reaction conditions.\n\nThe reactant is treated with red phosphorus (P) and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI).

The carbon skeleton is C₁₀. Since all double bonds are saturated and all oxygen atoms are removed, the product is a cycloalkane.\n\nThe general formula for a cycloalkane is CₙH₂ₙ. For a C₁₀ cycloalkane, the formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, can be calculated from the molecular formula or by examining the structure.\n\n**Method 1: Using the IHD Formula**\nThe formula for IHD is: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\nFor the product C₁₀H₂₀:\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2)\nIHD = 11 - 10\nIHD = 1\n\n**Method 2: Analyzing the Structure**\nThe IHD is the sum of the number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n*   The product has one ring (the cyclohexane ring).\n*   The product has zero double or triple bonds.\nTherefore, the IHD = 1 (for the ring) + 0 (for pi bonds) = 1.\n\nBoth methods yield an IHD of 1.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product, we must first identify the reactant and the product of the specified reaction.\n\n### 1.

Since it is a fully saturated monocyclic alkane, its general formula is CₙH₂ₙ. Therefore, the molecular formula of the product is **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\n### 4. Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, indicates the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. It can be calculated from the molecular formula using the following equation:\n\nIHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\n\nWhere:\n*   C is the number of carbon atoms.\n*   H is the number of hydrogen atoms.\n*   (Oxygen and sulfur atoms do not affect the calculation).\n\nFor the product with the molecular formula **C₁₀H₂₀**:\n*   IHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2)\n*   IHD = 11 - 10\n*   IHD = 1\n\nAn IHD of 1 indicates the presence of one ring or one double bond. Since the product is 1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane, a saturated molecule, the IHD of 1 corresponds to the single ring structure.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material.**\n\nThe starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's break down the name to draw its structure:\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: This is the parent structure, a six-membered ring with a double bond between carbon 3 and carbon 4.\n*   **carboxylic acid**: This is the principal functional group, so its carbon is designated as C1 on the ring. The group is -COOH.\n*   **2-formyl**: An aldehyde group (-CHO) is attached to C2 of the ring.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) is attached to C5 of the ring.\n\nBased on this, we can draw the structure:\n```\n       C1(-COOH)\n      / \\\n  H-C2(-CHO)--C3-H\n   /         ||\nH₂-C6          C4-H\n  \\         /\n  H-C5(-CH=CH₂)\n```\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the starting material.**\n\nThe IHD (also known as the degree of unsaturation) can be calculated by counting the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in the molecule.\n*   **Rings**: There is one six-membered ring. (IHD contribution = 1)\n*   **Pi bonds**:\n    *   One C=C double bond within the cyclohexene ring. (IHD contribution = 1)\n    *   One C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group. (IHD contribution = 1)\n    *   One C=O double bond in the formyl (aldehyde) group. (IHD contribution = 1)\n    *   One C=C double bond in the vinyl group. (IHD contribution = 1)\n\nTotal IHD of the starting material = 1 (ring) + 1 (ring C=C) + 1 (C=O acid) + 1 (C=O aldehyde) + 1 (vinyl C=C) = **5**.\n\nAlternatively, we can determine the molecular formula and use the IHD formula.\n*   Carbons (C): 6 (in ring) + 1 (in -COOH) + 1 (in -CHO) + 2 (in -CH=CH₂) = 10 carbons.\n*   Hydrogens (H): 1 (at C1) + 1 (at C2) + 1 (at C3) + 1 (at C4) + 1 (at C5) + 2 (at C6) + 1 (in -COOH) + 1 (in -CHO) + 3 (in -CH=CH₂) = 12 hydrogens.\n*   Oxygens (O): 2 (in -COOH) + 1 (in -CHO) = 3 oxygens.\nThe molecular formula is **C₁₀H₁₂O₃**.\n\nUsing the IHD formula: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 11 - 6 = **5**.\nBoth methods give the same IHD for the starting material.\n\n**Step 3: Understand the reaction and determine the structure of the product.**\n\nThe reagent is **red phosphorus and excess of hydroiodic acid (HI)**. This is a very powerful reducing agent known for the complete reduction of most oxygen-containing functional groups and multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated alkanes.\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The formyl group (-CHO) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   All carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) are reduced to single bonds (C-C).\n\nThe reaction will not, however, break the stable cycloalkane ring.\nSo, in the product:\n*   The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring (the C=C is reduced).\n*   The -COOH at C1 becomes a -CH₃ group.\n*   The -CHO at C2 becomes a -CH₃ group.\n*   The vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) at C5 becomes an ethyl group (-CH₂-CH₃).\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane: **1-ethyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohexane**. It is a saturated monocyclic alkane.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product.**\n\nWe can calculate the IHD of the product in two ways:\n\n*   **Method 1: Based on structural changes.**\n    The reaction reduces all four pi bonds in the starting material to single bonds. The ring structure remains intact.\n    IHD of product = IHD of starting material - (number of pi bonds reduced)\n    IHD of product = 5 - 4 = **1**.\n    The remaining IHD of 1 is due to the presence of the cyclohexane ring.\n\n*   **Method 2: Based on the product's structure/formula.**\n    The product is 1-ethyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohexane.\n    A molecule's IHD is the sum of its rings and pi bonds.\n    *   Number of rings = 1\n    *   Number of pi bonds = 0 (it is a fully saturated molecule)\n    IHD of product = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n    Alternatively, we can find the molecular formula of the product. The total number of carbons is 10 (6 from the ring + 2 from ethyl + 1 from one methyl + 1 from the other methyl). Since it is a monocyclic alkane, its general formula is CₙH₂ₙ. For n=10, the formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n    Using the IHD formula: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\n    IHD = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 11 - 10 = **1**.\n\nAll methods consistently yield an IHD of 1 for the final product.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0\nB) 5\nC) 1\nD) 3\n\nThe correct answer is 1.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nTo determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product, we must first understand the reaction that takes place.\n\n### 1. The Reactant and Reagents\n*   **Reactant:** 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (Red P) and excess hydroiodic acid (HI).\n\n### 2. The Reaction\nThe combination of red phosphorus and excess HI is a powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. It is known for the complete reduction of various oxygen-containing functional groups to their corresponding alkanes. This includes:\n*   Carboxylic acids (-COOH) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH3).\n*   Aldehydes (-CHO) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH3).\n*   Ketones (>C=O) are reduced to methylene groups (>CH2).\n*   Alcohols (-OH) are reduced to hydrogens (-H).\nFurthermore, this reagent also reduces carbon-carbon double and triple bonds to single bonds.\n\n### 3. Structure and Formula of the Reactant\nLet's break down the reactant's name to determine its structure:\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene:** A six-membered ring with a double bond between the 3rd and 4th carbon atoms.\n*   **-carboxylic acid:** A -COOH group, which we'll place at position 1.\n*   **2-formyl:** A -CHO group at position 2.\n*   **5-vinyl:** A -CH=CH2 group at position 5.\n\nThe molecular formula of 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is C10H12O3.\n\n### 4. The Product\nThe reaction with red P and excess HI will reduce all the functional groups and double bonds:\n*   The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring.\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) becomes a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The formyl group (-CHO) becomes a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The vinyl group (-CH=CH2) becomes an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n\nThe carbon skeleton of the molecule remains, but all double bonds (C=C and C=O) are saturated, and all oxygen atoms are removed. The initial C10 molecule is converted into a C10 cycloalkane. A cycloalkane with a single ring has the general formula CnH2n. Therefore, the product has the molecular formula **C10H20**.\n\n### 5. Calculating the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, indicates the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The formula for IHD is:\n\nIHD = C - (H/2) + (N/2) + 1\n\nWhere:\n*   C is the number of carbon atoms.\n*   H is the number of hydrogen atoms.\n*   N is the number of nitrogen atoms.\n\nFor our product with the formula C10H20:\n*   C = 10\n*   H = 20\n*   N = 0\n\nIHD = 10 - (20/2) + 0 + 1\nIHD = 10 - 10 + 1\nIHD = 1\n\nAn IHD of 1 corresponds to the presence of a single ring in the now fully saturated molecule (an alkyl-substituted cyclohexane).\n\nTherefore, the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nMy plan is to solve this problem by first understanding the chemical transformation and then calculating the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the resulting product.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactant:** The starting molecule is \"2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid\". I will determine its carbon skeleton and functional groups. It has a C6 ring (cyclohexene), a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), a formyl (aldehyde) group (-CHO), and a vinyl group (-CH=CH2). The total number of carbon atoms is 10.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction:** The reagent is \"red phosphorus and excess of HI\". This is one of the most powerful reducing agents in organic chemistry. It reduces almost all oxygen-containing functional groups (like aldehydes and carboxylic acids) and all multiple bonds (like C=C double bonds) completely to their corresponding saturated alkane parts.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product's Structure:** The reaction will convert the cyclohexene ring to a cyclohexane ring, the formyl group to a methyl group, the carboxylic acid group to a methyl group, and the vinyl group to an ethyl group. The result is a saturated hydrocarbon that retains the original six-membered ring. The product is a substituted cyclohexane with a total of 10 carbon atoms.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD):** The IHD (or degree of unsaturation) is a count of how many rings and pi (π) bonds are in a molecule. The formula is `IHD = (Number of Rings) + (Number of π bonds)`.\n    *   Since the product is a substituted **cyclohexane**, it has **one ring**.\n    *   Since the reaction reduces all double bonds, the product is fully saturated and has **zero π bonds**.\n    *   Therefore, the IHD of the product will be 1 + 0 = 1.\n\n5.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script that codifies this logic, calculates the IHD based on the product's structural features (1 ring, 0 pi bonds), and prints the final answer corresponding to the given multiple-choice options.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) for the product of a specific chemical reaction.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: Define the reaction and its effect.\n    # The reaction of 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid with red phosphorus and excess HI\n    # is a complete reduction.

By convention, this is placed at position C1.\n*   **2-formyl**: A -CHO (aldehyde) group is attached to C2.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A -CH=CH2 group is attached to C5.\n\nThe structure contains several features that contribute to the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD), which is a measure of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds.\n*   One ring (the cyclohexene ring).\n*   One carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) within the ring.\n*   One carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) in the vinyl group.\n*   One carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O) in the carboxylic acid group.\n*   One carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O) in the formyl group.\n\nThe IHD of the starting material is the sum of these features: 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C in ring) + 1 (C=C in vinyl) + 1 (C=O in COOH) + 1 (C=O in CHO) = 5.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the chemical reaction.**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI)**. This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. Its key function is to perform a complete reduction on oxygen-containing functional groups and carbon-carbon multiple bonds.\n\nHere's how it affects the functional groups in our starting material:\n*   **Carboxylic acid group (-COOH)**: It gets fully reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   **Formyl group (-CHO)**: It gets fully reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   **Carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C)**: Both the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the vinyl group are reduced to single bonds (C-C). The vinyl group (-CH=CH2) becomes an ethyl group (-CH2-CH3).\n*   **The ring structure itself remains intact.**\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of the product.**\n\nThe reaction preserves the carbon skeleton but removes all multiple bonds and oxygen atoms, replacing them with hydrogen atoms until the molecule is fully saturated.\n*   The **cyclohex-3-ene** ring becomes a **cyclohexane** ring (a saturated ring).\n*   The **carboxylic acid** group at C1 becomes a **methyl** group.\n*   The **formyl** group at C2 becomes a **methyl** group.\n*   The **vinyl** group at C5 becomes an **ethyl** group.\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane.

This compound is treated with red phosphorus (P) and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI).\n\n2.  **The Reaction**: The combination of red phosphorus and excess HI is a powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. This reagent is capable of reducing multiple functional groups completely to their corresponding alkanes. Specifically:\n    *   Aldehyde groups (-CHO) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH3).\n    *   Carboxylic acid groups (-COOH) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH3).\n    *   Carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C), like those in the cyclohexene ring and the vinyl group, are saturated to become single bonds (C-C).\n    *   The red phosphorus serves to regenerate the HI from the iodine (I2) that is formed during the reaction, allowing the reduction to go to completion.\n\n3.  **Determining the Product's Structure**:\n    *   The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The carboxylic acid at position 1 becomes a methyl group.\n    *   The formyl group at position 2 becomes a methyl group.\n    *   The vinyl group (-CH=CH2) at position 5 is reduced to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n\n    Therefore, the final product is **1-ethyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohexane**.\n\n4.  **Determining the Molecular Formula of the Product**:\n    *   The cyclohexane ring has 6 carbon atoms.\n    *   The ethyl group has 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   The two methyl groups have 1 carbon atom each.\n    *   Total carbons = 6 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 10 carbons.\n    *   A saturated acyclic alkane with 10 carbons would have the formula C10H(2*10 + 2) = C10H22.\n    *   Since the product has one ring, two hydrogen atoms are removed.\n    *   Therefore, the molecular formula of the product is **C10H20**.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)**: The IHD, also known as the degree of unsaturation, indicates the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. It can be calculated from the molecular formula or by examining the structure.\n\n    *   **From the structure**: The product, 1-ethyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohexane, contains one ring and no double or triple bonds. A ring counts as one unit of hydrogen deficiency. Therefore, the IHD is 1.\n\n    *   **From the formula (CxHy)**: The IHD can be calculated using the formula: IHD = x - (y/2) + 1.\n        For the product C10H20:\n        IHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1\n        IHD = 10 - 10 + 1\n        IHD = 1\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the final product is 1.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nThe problem asks for the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product formed when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is treated with red phosphorus and an excess of hydriodic acid (HI).\n\n### Step 1: Determine the structure and formula of the starting material.\nThe starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Cyclohex-3-ene**: A six-membered ring with a double bond between carbon 3 and carbon 4.\n*   **-carboxylic acid**: A -COOH group is at position 1.\n*   **2-formyl**: A -CHO group is at position 2.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A -CH=CH₂ group is at position 5.\n\nLet's determine its molecular formula:\n*   Carbons (C): 6 in the ring + 1 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO + 2 in -CH=CH₂ = 10 carbons (C₁₀).\n*   Oxygens (O): 2 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO = 3 oxygens (O₃).\n*   Hydrogens (H): Let's count them on the structure.\n    *   Ring H's: H at C1, H at C2, H at C3, H at C4, H at C5, 2H at C6 = 7 H.\n    *   -COOH H: 1 H.\n    *   -CHO H: 1 H.\n    *   -CH=CH₂ H's: 3 H.\n    *   Total H = 7 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12 hydrogens (H₁₂).\nThe molecular formula of the starting material is C₁₀H₁₂O₃.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the reaction and identify the product.\nThe reagent used is red phosphorus (P) and excess hydriodic acid (HI).

The carbon skeleton remains the same (10 carbon atoms). The product is a saturated hydrocarbon with one ring.\n\nThe general formula for an acyclic alkane is CₙH₂ₙ₊₂. For a C₁₀ acyclic alkane, the formula would be C₁₀H₂₂. The presence of a single ring reduces the hydrogen count by two. Therefore, the molecular formula for a C₁₀ cycloalkane is C₁₀H₂₀.\n\nThe product, 1,2-dimethyl-4-ethylcyclohexane, is a cycloalkane containing a total of 10 carbon atoms, so its formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product.\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), or degree of unsaturation, indicates the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The formula for IHD for a hydrocarbon (CₐHₑ) is:\n\nIHD = a - (b/2) + 1\n\nFor the product with the formula C₁₀H₂₀:\nIHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1\nIHD = 10 - 10 + 1\nIHD = 1\n\nThis result is consistent with the structure of the product, which is a cyclohexane ring (one ring) with no double or triple bonds.

The Reaction: Reduction with Red Phosphorus and Excess HI\n\nRed phosphorus in the presence of excess hydroiodic acid (HI) is a very powerful reducing agent. This reagent is known to reduce a wide variety of functional groups completely down to the corresponding alkane.\n\nSpecifically, for the functional groups present in our reactant:\n*   **Carboxylic acid (-COOH)** is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   **Aldehyde (-CHO)** is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   **Alkenes (C=C)** are reduced to alkanes (C-C).\n\n### 3. The Product\n\nThe reaction will cause the following transformations:\n*   The cyclohexene ring will be reduced to a cyclohexane ring (the C=C bond is saturated).\n*   The carboxylic acid group at position 1 will become a methyl group.\n*   The formyl group at position 2 will become a methyl group.\n*   The vinyl group at position 5 will be reduced to an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n\nTherefore, the final product is a saturated cycloalkane with three alkyl substituents: 1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane (the numbering is based on the reactant for clarity). This is a saturated molecule containing a single ring.\n\n### 4. Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product\n\nThe IHD is a count of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n*   **Rings:** The product, 1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane, contains one cyclohexane ring. This accounts for an IHD of 1.\n*   **Pi (π) bonds:** The reduction process eliminates all double bonds (C=C and C=O) that were present in the reactant. The final product is a saturated alkane, meaning it has no double or triple bonds.\n\nThus, the only contribution to the IHD of the product is the single ring structure.\n\n**IHD of product = 1 (for the ring) + 0 (for pi bonds) = 1**\n\nThe molecular formula of the product is C₁₀H₂₀. We can verify the IHD using the formula IHD = C - H/2 + 1:\nIHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1 = 10 - 10 + 1 = 1.\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the final product is 1.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\n**1. Analyze the Reactant**\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down its structure to understand its components and calculate its initial index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD).\n\n*   **Cyclohex-3-ene**: This is a six-membered ring containing one carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   A ring contributes 1 to the IHD.\n    *   The double bond (C=C) contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **Carboxylic acid (-COOH)**: This functional group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n    *   This double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **Formyl (-CHO)**: This is an aldehyde group, which also contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n    *   This double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **Vinyl (-CH=CH2)**: This substituent contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n    *   This double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n\n**Initial IHD of the reactant:**\nSumming up all contributions:\nIHD = (1 for the ring) + (1 for the C=C in the ring) + (1 for the C=O in carboxylic acid) + (1 for the C=O in the formyl group) + (1 for the C=C in the vinyl group) = **5**.\n\nAlternatively, we can determine the molecular formula and calculate the IHD from it.\n*   The structure is C6H5(COOH)(CHO)(C2H3).\n*   Carbons (C): 6 (ring) + 1 (acid) + 1 (aldehyde) + 2 (vinyl) = 10\n*   Hydrogens (H): Let's count them on the structure `C1(-COOH)-C2(-CHO)-C3H=C4H-C5H(-CH=CH2)-C6H2-`.\n    *   H on ring carbons: 1(on C1) + 1(on C2) + 1(on C3) + 1(on C4) + 1(on C5) + 2(on C6) = 7 H.\n    *   H on functional groups: 1(in COOH) + 1(in CHO) + 3(in vinyl) = 5 H.\n    *   Total H = 7 + 5 = 12.\n*   Oxygens (O): 2 (in COOH) + 1 (in CHO) = 3.\n*   Molecular formula of reactant: **C10H12O3**.\n\nNow, calculate IHD using the formula `IHD = C + 1 - H/2`:\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 11 - 6 = **5**. This confirms our structural analysis.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\nThe reagent used is **red phosphorus and an excess of HI (Red P + HI)**. This is a very strong reducing agent. Its effect is to reduce nearly all oxygen-containing functional groups and unsaturations (double/triple bonds) to their corresponding saturated alkane forms.\n\n*   **Alkene reduction**: All C=C bonds will be reduced to C-C single bonds.\n*   **Carbonyl reduction**: Both the aldehyde (-CHO) and carboxylic acid (-COOH) groups will be fully reduced to methyl (-CH3) groups.\n*   **Ring stability**: The cyclohexane ring itself is stable and will not be opened under these conditions.\n\n**3. Determine the Product**\n\nThe reaction will proceed as follows:\n*   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring.\n*   The `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) at position 1 becomes a `methyl` group (-CH3).\n*   The `formyl` group (-CHO) at position 2 becomes a `methyl` group (-CH3).\n*   The `vinyl` group (-CH=CH2) at position 5 becomes an `ethyl` group (-CH2CH3).\n\nThe resulting product is a substituted cyclohexane (specifically, 4-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane, though the exact IUPAC name is not required). The key takeaway is that the product is a **saturated cycloalkane**. It contains a single ring but has no double or triple bonds.\n\n**4. Calculate the IHD of the Product**\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) is the sum of the number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n\n*   **Rings**: The product has one cyclohexane ring. Contribution = 1.\n*   **Pi bonds**: The product is fully saturated, meaning it has no double or triple bonds. Contribution = 0.\n\n**Final IHD of the product = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = 1.**\n\nAlternatively, we can determine the molecular formula of the product. The carbon skeleton is conserved (C=10). The product is a saturated monocyclic alkane, so its general formula is CnH2n.\n*   Molecular formula of the product: **C10H20**.\n\nNow, calculate IHD using the formula:\nIHD = C + 1 - H/2 = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 11 - 10 = **1**.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the structure and properties of the reactant.**\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down the name to understand its structure:\n*   **cyclohex**: A six-membered carbon ring.\n*   **-3-ene**: A double bond (C=C) between carbon 3 and carbon 4 of the ring.\n*   **carboxylic acid**: A -COOH group. By convention, this is at position 1.\n*   **2-formyl**: A -CHO group (an aldehyde) at position 2.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A -CH=CH2 group at position 5.\n\nThe structure contains several features that contribute to the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as degrees of unsaturation. The IHD is a count of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n\nLet's count the sources of unsaturation in the reactant:\n1.  **The ring structure**: 1 degree of unsaturation.\n2.  **The C=C double bond in the ring** (cyclohex-3-ene): 1 degree of unsaturation.\n3.  **The C=C double bond in the vinyl group** (-CH=CH2): 1 degree of unsaturation.\n4.  **The C=O double bond in the formyl group** (-CHO): 1 degree of unsaturation.\n5.  **The C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group** (-COOH): 1 degree of unsaturation.\n\nSo, the total Index of Hydrogen Deficiency for the reactant is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n\nTo confirm, let's determine the molecular formula of the reactant: C10H12O3.\nUsing the IHD formula: IHD = C + 1 - H/2 - X/2 + N/2\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 11 - 6 = 5. This confirms our structural analysis.\n\n### **Step 2: Understand the chemical reaction.**\n\nThe reagent used is **red phosphorus and excess of HI** (Red P + HI). This is a very powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. Its key function is to reduce various oxygen-containing functional groups and multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated alkanes.\n\nSpecifically, Red P + HI will:\n*   Reduce aldehydes (-CHO) to methyl groups (-CH3).\n*   Reduce carboxylic acids (-COOH) to methyl groups (-CH3).\n*   Reduce C=C double bonds to C-C single bonds.\n\nEssentially, this reaction will saturate all double bonds (both C=C and C=O) and remove all oxygen atoms, converting the molecule to its parent hydrocarbon while preserving the carbon skeleton.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the structure and properties of the product.**\n\nThe reaction will act on the reactant as follows:\n*   The C=C bond in the cyclohexene ring will be reduced to a C-C bond.\n*   The C=C bond in the vinyl group will be reduced, converting the vinyl group (-CH=CH2) into an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n*   The formyl group (-CHO) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n\nThe initial carbon skeleton (a 6-membered ring with three substituents) is preserved. The final product will be a substituted **cyclohexane** (a saturated ring). All the pi bonds from the original functional groups and unsaturations will be gone.\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of the product.**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency is the sum of rings and pi bonds.\n*   The product still contains the six-membered ring. This contributes **1** to the IHD.\n*   All the pi bonds (C=C and C=O) in the reactant have been reduced to single bonds. Therefore, there are no more pi bonds in the product.\n\nThe only remaining source of hydrogen deficiency in the product is the ring itself.\nSo, the IHD of the product = 1 (for the ring) + 0 (for pi bonds) = 1.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the molecular formula of the product.\nThe reactant is C10H12O3. The product is the corresponding saturated hydrocarbon, which is a substituted cyclohexane. A monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane with no other rings or double bonds) has the general formula CnH2n. Since the carbon count is 10, the product's formula is C10H20.\n\nLet's calculate the IHD for C10H20:\nIHD = C + 1 - H/2\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (20/2)\nIHD = 11 - 10\nIHD = 1\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.

Let's count its sources of unsaturation (rings and π bonds) to determine its IHD.\n\n*   **Rings:** The molecule has a `cyclohexene` ring, which counts as **1** unit of deficiency.\n*   **π Bonds:**\n    1.  One C=C double bond within the `cyclohex-3-ene` ring.\n    2.  One C=C double bond in the `vinyl` group (-CH=CH₂).\n    3.  One C=O double bond in the `formyl` group (-CHO).\n    4.  One C=O double bond in the `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH).\n    This gives a total of **4** π bonds.\n\nThe total IHD of the reactant is the sum of rings and π bonds:\nIHD_reactant = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds) = 1 + 4 = 5.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Chemical Reaction**\n\nThe reagent used is **red phosphorus and excess HI (Red P + HI)**. This is a very powerful reducing agent known for the complete reduction of oxygen-containing functional groups and carbon-carbon multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated alkane forms.\n\nThe reaction will cause the following changes:\n*   The C=C double bond in the ring will be reduced to a C-C single bond.\n*   The C=C double bond in the vinyl group will be reduced to a C-C single bond.\n*   The formyl group (-CHO) and the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) will be fully reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n\nEssentially, all π bonds in the molecule are eliminated, but the ring structure remains.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Product's Structure and IHD**\n\nThe reaction removes all sources of unsaturation except for the ring itself.\n*   The product is a substituted **cyclohexane** (a saturated ring).\n*   All functional groups and multiple bonds on the side chains have been reduced to their saturated forms.\n\nNow, let's calculate the IHD of the final product:\n*   **Number of rings:** The cyclohexane ring is preserved, so there is **1 ring**.\n*   **Number of π bonds:** All C=C and C=O bonds have been reduced to single bonds. There are **0 π bonds** left.\n\nThe IHD of the product is:\nIHD_product = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1, which corresponds to the single ring in the molecule.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 0\nB) 5\nC) 3\nD) 1\n\nThe correct answer is 1.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1.

The reaction removes four pi bonds (two C=C and two C=O), which means the IHD decreases by 4.\nInitial IHD = 5\nChange in IHD = -4\nFinal IHD = 5 - 4 = 1.\n\nThe final IHD of 1 corresponds to the single ring structure of the cyclohexane backbone.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure and molecular formula of the reactant.**\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down the name to determine its structure:\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: This is the parent structure, a six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbon 3 and carbon 4.\n*   **carboxylic acid**: This is the principal functional group (-COOH). By IUPAC convention for cyclic carboxylic acids, the carbon of the ring to which the -COOH group is attached is numbered C1.\n*   **2-formyl**: A formyl group (-CHO) is attached to C2 of the ring.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A vinyl group (-CH=CH2) is attached to C5 of the ring.\n\nThe numbering of the ring starts at the carbon bearing the principal functional group (-COOH) and proceeds in the direction that gives the lowest locants to the multiple bonds and then the substituents.\n\nThe structure has the following features contributing to its index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation:\n1.  One ring (the cyclohexene ring): IHD = 1\n2.  One carbon-carbon double bond in the ring (the \"-3-ene\" part): IHD = 1\n3.  One carbon-carbon double bond in the vinyl group (-CH=CH2): IHD = 1\n4.  One carbon-oxygen double bond in the formyl group (-CHO): IHD = 1\n5.  One carbon-oxygen double bond in the carboxylic acid group (-COOH): IHD = 1\n\nAdding these up, the total IHD of the reactant is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n\nFor confirmation, let's find the molecular formula of the reactant and calculate its IHD.\n*   Carbons (C): 6 in the ring + 1 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO + 2 in -CH=CH2 = 10 carbons.\n*   Hydrogens (H): 1 on C1, 1 on C2, 1 on C3, 1 on C4, 1 on C5, 2 on C6, 1 in -COOH, 1 in -CHO, 3 in -CH=CH2. Total H = 1+1+1+1+1+2+1+1+3 = 12 hydrogens.\n*   Oxygens (O): 2 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO = 3 oxygens.\nThe molecular formula is **C10H12O3**.\nThe IHD formula is: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2). (Oxygen atoms do not affect the IHD calculation).\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 11 - 6 = 5. This matches our structural analysis.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the reaction and determine the product's structure.**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess of HI**. This is a very powerful reducing agent known for the complete reduction of most oxygen-containing functional groups and multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated alkane forms.\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The formyl group (-CHO) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The carbon-carbon double bond in the ring is reduced to a single bond (hydrogenated).\n*   The carbon-carbon double bond in the vinyl group is reduced to a single bond (the vinyl group becomes an ethyl group, -CH2CH3).\n\nThe carbon skeleton, including the ring, remains intact. The reaction removes all pi bonds and oxygen atoms, converting the molecule into a saturated hydrocarbon.\n\nThe product will be a substituted **cyclohexane** (since the ring C=C is reduced). The substituents will be two methyl groups and one ethyl group. The carbon skeleton is C10.\nThe product is a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product.**\n\nThe IHD of a molecule is the sum of its rings and pi bonds.\nThe product is a substituted cyclohexane.\n*   Number of rings = 1\n*   Number of pi bonds (C=C, C≡C, C=O, etc.) = 0 (since it is a fully saturated alkane)\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the product is 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the molecular formula of the product.\nThe product is a saturated monocyclic alkane with 10 carbon atoms. The general formula for a monocyclic alkane is CnH2n.\nSo, the molecular formula of the product is **C10H20**.\nUsing the IHD formula:\nIHD = C + 1 - (H/2) = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\nBoth methods give the same result. The index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) 3\nB) 1\nC) 0\nD) 5\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a step-by-by-step analysis to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency of the final product.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Reactant\n\nThe starting compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's break down its structure to find its molecular formula:\n*   **Cyclohex-3-ene**: A six-membered carbon ring with one double bond.\n*   **Carboxylic acid**: A -COOH group. Let's assume it's at position 1.\n*   **2-formyl**: A -CHO (aldehyde) group at position 2.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A -CH=CH₂ group at position 5.\n\nThe molecular formula for this structure is C₁₀H₁₂O₃.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Reaction\n\nThe reactant is treated with red phosphorus (P) and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination is an extremely powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. Its primary function is to reduce various oxygen-containing functional groups and unsaturated bonds to their corresponding alkanes.\n\nSpecifically, this reagent will cause the following reductions:\n*   **Carboxylic acid (-COOH)** is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   **Aldehyde (-CHO)** is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   **Alkene (C=C)** bonds (both in the ring and the vinyl group) are reduced to single bonds (C-C).\n\nEssentially, every double bond and all oxygen atoms are removed, and the molecule is fully saturated with hydrogen.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Product's Structure and Formula\n\nThe reaction reduces all functional groups and double bonds, but it does not break the carbon ring. The carbon skeleton remains intact.\n\n*   The `cyclohexene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring.\n*   The `carboxylic acid` at position 1 becomes a `methyl` group.\n*   The `formyl group` at position 2 becomes a `methyl` group.\n*   The `vinyl group` at position 5 becomes an `ethyl` group.\n\nThe original molecule had 10 carbon atoms, and since no carbons are lost, the product will also have 10 carbon atoms. The product is a fully saturated, substituted cycloalkane. A saturated hydrocarbon with a single ring (a cycloalkane) has the general formula CₙH₂ₙ.\n\nGiven that our product has 10 carbon atoms (n=10), its molecular formula will be **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, indicates the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The formula for IHD is:\n\nIHD = C - (H/2) + (N/2) + 1\n\nWhere C is the number of carbon atoms, H is the number of hydrogen atoms, and N is the number of nitrogen atoms.\n\nFor our product with the formula **C₁₀H₂₀**:\n*   C = 10\n*   H = 20\n*   N = 0\n\nIHD = 10 - (20/2) + 0 + 1\nIHD = 10 - 10 + 1\nIHD = 1\n\nThis IHD of 1 corresponds to the single ring structure of the cyclohexane backbone. All other forms of unsaturation (double bonds from the original alkene, aldehyde, and carboxylic acid groups) have been eliminated.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the final product:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactant:** The starting molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. We first need to determine its carbon skeleton.\n    *   `cyclohex`: A 6-carbon ring.\n    *   `carboxylic acid`: Adds 1 carbon (-COOH).\n    *   `formyl`: Adds 1 carbon (-CHO).\n    *   `vinyl`: Adds 2 carbons (-CH=CH2).\n    *   The total number of carbon atoms in the molecule is 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10.\n\n2.  **Understand the Reaction:** The reagent is red phosphorus with an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination is a powerful reducing agent known for the complete reduction of almost all oxygen-containing functional groups and carbon-carbon multiple bonds to their corresponding alkanes.\n    *   The `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   The `formyl` group (-CHO) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   The `vinyl` group's double bond (-CH=CH2) will be reduced to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n    *   The `cyclohexene` ring's double bond will be reduced to a single bond, resulting in a `cyclohexane` ring.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product:** The reaction will preserve the original carbon skeleton but will remove all oxygen atoms and saturate all multiple bonds. The product will be a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon with 10 carbon atoms (a substituted cyclohexane).\n\n4.  **Calculate the IHD of the Product:** The general molecular formula for a saturated monocyclic alkane (like a substituted cyclohexane) is CnH2n. Since our product has 10 carbon atoms (n=10), its molecular formula will be C10H20. The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) can be calculated using the formula:\n    `IHD = C - H/2 + 1` (for a hydrocarbon).\n    The IHD of 1 corresponds to the single ring structure in the final product.\n\nThe Python code below will perform the calculation based on this logic.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) for the product of a chemical reaction.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Determine the number of carbon atoms in the reactant.\n    # Reactant: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid\n    c_in_ring = 6\n    c_in_cooh = 1\n    c_in_cho = 1\n    c_in_vinyl = 2\n    total_carbons = c_in_ring + c_in_cooh + c_in_cho + c_in_vinyl\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the molecular formula of the product.\n    # The reaction with red P and excess HI is a complete reduction.\n    # It converts the reactant to its corresponding saturated monocyclic alkane.\n    # The general formula for a saturated monocyclic alkane is CnH2n.\n    product_carbons = total_carbons\n    product_hydrogens = 2 * product_carbons\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n    # IHD = C - H/2 + 1 (for a molecule with only C and H)\n    ihd_product = product_carbons - (product_hydrogens / 2) + 1\n    \n    # Step 4: Print the final answer.\n    # The options are A) 3, B) 0, C) 1, D) 5\n    print(f\"The number of carbon atoms in the reactant is {total_carbons}.\")\n    print(f\"The reaction with red P + HI reduces the compound to a saturated monocyclic alkane.\")\n    print(f\"The molecular formula of the saturated monocyclic product is C{product_carbons}H{product_hydrogens}.\")\n    print(f\"The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) is calculated as: C - H/2 + 1\")\n    print(f\"IHD = {product_carbons} - ({product_hydrogens}/2) + 1 = {int(ihd_product)}\")\n    print(\"This IHD of 1 corresponds to the single ring in the product molecule.\")\n    print(\"Comparing with the options:\")\n    print(\"A) 3\")\n    print(\"B) 0\")\n    print(\"C) 1\")\n    print(\"D) 5\")\n    print(\"The correct option is C.\")\n\nsolve_chemistry_problem()\n<<<C>>>\n```\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: \nErrors:   File \"<stdin>\", line 41\n    <<<C>>>\n    ^^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the structure of the reactant.**\nThe reactant is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

An example isomer would be 1-ethyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohexane. The initial carbon skeleton of 10 carbon atoms is retained. The product is a saturated cycloalkane.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as degrees of unsaturation, can be calculated from the molecular formula using the following equation:\n\nIHD = C - (H/2) + (N/2) + 1\n\nWhere C is the number of carbon atoms, H is the number of hydrogen atoms, and N is the number of nitrogen atoms. Oxygen and halogens do not affect the IHD calculation in this form of the formula.\n\n*   **Product Molecular Formula:** The product is a saturated cycloalkane with 10 carbon atoms (C10). A saturated, non-cyclic alkane would have the formula CnH(2n+2). A saturated cycloalkane with one ring has the formula CnH(2n). Therefore, the molecular formula of our product is C10H20.\n\n*   **IHD Calculation:**\n    *   IHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1\n    *   IHD = 10 - 10 + 1\n    *   IHD = 1\n\nAlternatively, the IHD can be found by simply counting the number of rings and π-bonds in the structure. The final product is a substituted cyclohexane, which contains one ring and no π-bonds. Therefore, its IHD is 1.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Structure and Formula of the Reactant\n\nThe starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Cyclohex-3-ene**: A six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between C3 and C4.\n*   **-carboxylic acid**: A -COOH group is attached to C1 of the ring.\n*   **2-formyl**: A -CHO group is attached to C2 of the ring.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A -CH=CH₂ group is attached to C5 of the ring.\n\nBased on this structure, the molecular formula is C₁₀H₁₂O₃.\n\nLet's verify the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) for the reactant to confirm its structure.\nThe IHD is calculated by the formula: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2), ignoring oxygen atoms.\nIHD (reactant) = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 11 - 6 = 5.\n\nThis IHD of 5 corresponds to:\n*   1 for the ring structure.\n*   1 for the double bond in the cyclohexene ring.\n*   1 for the double bond in the vinyl group.\n*   1 for the C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid.\n*   1 for the C=O double bond in the formyl group.\nThe calculation confirms the structure is correct.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Reaction and the Product\n\nThe reactant is treated with red phosphorus (P) and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination is a powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce most oxygen-containing functional groups, as well as carbon-carbon multiple bonds, to alkanes.\n\nThe reaction will proceed as follows:\n*   The **carboxylic acid group** (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The **formyl group** (-CHO) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The **vinyl group** (-CH=CH₂) is reduced to an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n*   The **carbon-carbon double bond** within the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a single bond.\n\nTherefore, the starting molecule is completely reduced to a substituted cyclohexane. The final product is 5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Molecular Formula of the Product\n\nThe product is 5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane. Let's find its molecular formula:\n*   **Cyclohexane ring**: C₆H₁₂.\n*   Three hydrogens on the ring are substituted with:\n    *   One methyl group (-CH₃)\n    *   Another methyl group (-CH₃)\n    *   One ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)\n*   **Total carbons**: 6 (from ring) + 1 (from first methyl) + 1 (from second methyl) + 2 (from ethyl) = 10 carbons.\n*   **Total hydrogens**: A saturated acyclic alkane with 10 carbons has the formula C₁₀H₂₂. Since the product has one ring, two hydrogens are subtracted. Thus, the formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (also known as degrees of unsaturation) indicates the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule.\n\nThe IHD can be determined from the molecular formula C₁₀H₂₀:\n*   IHD = (2C + 2 - H) / 2\n*   IHD = (2 * 10 + 2 - 20) / 2\n*   IHD = (20 + 2 - 20) / 2\n*   IHD = 2 / 2 = 1\n\nAlternatively, the IHD can be found by inspecting the structure of the product, 5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane. The molecule consists of a single cyclohexane ring and contains no double or triple bonds. A ring counts as one degree of unsaturation.\n\nTherefore, the index of hydrogen deficiency of the final product is 1.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nTo determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the final product, we must first understand the starting material and the nature of the chemical reaction.\n\n### 1.

Let's break down its structure to find its molecular formula:\n*   **Cyclohex-3-ene:** A six-membered carbon ring with one double bond.\n*   **Carboxylic acid (-COOH):** This group contains one carbon, two oxygens, and one hydrogen. Let's assume it is at position 1 of the ring.\n*   **Formyl group (-CHO):** An aldehyde group containing one carbon, one oxygen, and one hydrogen, located at position 2.\n*   **Vinyl group (-CH=CH₂):** An alkene group with two carbons and three hydrogens, located at position 5.\n\nBased on this structure, the molecular formula is **C₁₀H₁₂O₃**.\n\nWe can calculate the IHD of the reactant to verify the structure. The formula for IHD is:\nIHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 11 - 6 = 5\n\nThis IHD of 5 corresponds to:\n*   1 for the ring structure.\n*   1 for the double bond within the ring (cyclohex-3-ene).\n*   1 for the double bond in the vinyl group.\n*   1 for the carbonyl double bond (C=O) in the formyl group.\n*   1 for the carbonyl double bond (C=O) in the carboxylic acid group.\n\n### 2. The Reaction\n\nThe reagent used is red phosphorus (Red P) with an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination is a very strong reducing agent. It is known to reduce various functional groups completely to alkanes:\n*   **Aldehydes and Ketones:** The carbonyl group (C=O) is reduced to a methylene group (-CH₂-), and a terminal aldehyde like the formyl group (-CHO) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   **Carboxylic Acids:** The carboxyl group (-COOH) is completely reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   **Alkenes and Alkynes:** Carbon-carbon double and triple bonds are reduced to single bonds.\n*   **Alcohols:** The hydroxyl group (-OH) is replaced by a hydrogen atom.\n\nThe role of red phosphorus is to regenerate HI from the iodine (I₂) that is formed during the reaction, thus allowing the reaction to go to completion.\n\n### 3. The Product\n\nGiven the potent reducing power of Red P + HI, all the functional groups and unsaturations in the reactant molecule will be reduced:\n*   The **carboxylic acid** at position 1 becomes a **methyl group**.\n*   The **formyl group** at position 2 becomes a **methyl group**.\n*   The **double bond in the cyclohexene ring** is saturated, forming a **cyclohexane ring**.\n*   The **vinyl group** at position 5 is reduced to an **ethyl group** (-CH₂CH₃).\n\nTherefore, the final product is **1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane**.\n\n### 4. Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product\n\nNow, let's determine the molecular formula of the product, 1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane:\n*   **Carbon atoms:** 6 in the ring + 1 from the first methyl + 1 from the second methyl + 2 from the ethyl group = 10 carbon atoms (C₁₀).\n*   **Hydrogen atoms:** A saturated acyclic alkane with 10 carbons would have the formula C₁₀H₂₂. A cycloalkane with one ring has the general formula CₙH₂ₙ. Thus, for 10 carbons, the formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n\nThe molecular formula of the product is **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency for the product is calculated as:\nIHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 11 - 10 = 1\n\nThis single degree of unsaturation is accounted for by the presence of the cyclohexane ring. Since there are no double or triple bonds in the final product, the IHD is 1.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nThe reaction of 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid with red phosphorus and excess HI is a strong reduction reaction.

Determine the Structure of the Final Product**\nThe reaction removes all oxygen atoms and all pi (π) bonds, but the carbon ring itself remains intact.\n*   The cyclohexene ring becomes a **cyclohexane** ring.\n*   All substituents are now simple alkyl groups attached to the cyclohexane ring.\n\nThe final product is a fully saturated, substituted cycloalkane.\n\n**5. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)**\nThe IHD (or degree of unsaturation) is defined as the sum of the number of rings and the number of π bonds in a molecule.\n\nIHD = (Number of Rings) + (Number of π bonds)\n\nFor the final product:\n*   **Number of Rings:** The single cyclohexane ring is preserved. So, the number of rings is **1**.\n*   **Number of π bonds:** The product is a fully saturated alkane, meaning it has no C=C or C=O double bonds. So, the number of π bonds is **0**.\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the product is:\nIHD = 1 + 0 = **1**\n\nThe final answer is **B**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\n**Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactant:** The starting molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n    *   Let's determine its carbon skeleton. It has a six-membered ring (6 carbons), a formyl group (-CHO, 1 carbon), a carboxylic acid group (-COOH, 1 carbon), and a vinyl group (-CH=CH2, 2 carbons).\n    *   Total number of carbons = 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10 carbons.\n    *   The structure contains one ring and several pi bonds (one C=C in the ring, one C=C in the vinyl group, one C=O in the formyl group, and one C=O in the carboxylic acid group).\n\n2.  **Identify the Reagents and Reaction Type:** The reagents are red phosphorus (Red P) and excess hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination is known as a very powerful reducing agent that performs an exhaustive reduction.\n    *   **Effect on Functional Groups:** It reduces aldehydes, ketones, and carboxylic acids completely down to their corresponding alkane forms (i.e., it removes all oxygen atoms and saturates the carbon). A -CHO group becomes a -CH3 group, and a -COOH group also becomes a -CH3 group.\n    *   **Effect on Multiple Bonds:** It hydrogenates all carbon-carbon double and triple bonds to single bonds.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product:** The reaction will preserve the original carbon skeleton but remove all multiple bonds and oxygen atoms.\n    *   The C10 carbon skeleton will remain.\n    *   The six-membered ring will remain, but the C=C bond within it will be reduced to a C-C bond, making it a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   All other pi bonds (in the formyl, carboxyl, and vinyl groups) will also be removed.\n    *   The final product is a saturated hydrocarbon with a single ring structure and 10 carbon atoms. This type of molecule is a cycloalkane.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product:**\n    *   The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (also known as degrees of unsaturation) is calculated by the formula: IHD = (Number of Rings) + (Number of Pi Bonds).\n    *   For the product molecule:\n        *   Number of Rings = 1 (the cyclohexane ring is preserved).\n        *   Number of Pi Bonds = 0 (the reaction is an exhaustive reduction, saturating all multiple bonds).\n    *   Therefore, the IHD of the product is 1 + 0 = 1.\n\n5.  **Verification with Molecular Formula:**\n    *   A saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon (a cycloalkane) has the general formula CnH2n.\n    *   Since our product has 10 carbon atoms, its molecular formula is C10H20.\n    *   We can use the standard IHD formula to verify: IHD = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1. For a hydrocarbon, this simplifies to IHD = C - H/2 + 1.\n    *   IHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1 = 10 - 10 + 1 = 1.\n\nBoth methods confirm that the IHD of the product is 1. I can use a simple python script to do this final calculation.\n\n```python\n# The problem reduces to finding the IHD of a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon with 10 carbon atoms.\n# The general formula for such a molecule (a cycloalkane) is C(n)H(2n).\n# For n=10, the formula is C10H20.\n# The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) formula for a hydrocarbon is IHD = C - H/2 + 1.\n\nnum_carbons = 10\nnum_hydrogens = 20\n\n# Calculate the IHD\nihd = num_carbons - (num_hydrogens / 2) + 1\n\n# Print the result as an integer\nprint(int(ihd))\n```\nThe thinking process is complete and verified.

Calculating the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD):**\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency (also known as the degree of unsaturation) indicates the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. It can be calculated from the molecular formula C_c H_h N_n O_o X_x using the formula:\n\nIHD = c - (h/2) - (x/2) + (n/2) + 1.\n\nFor our product with the molecular formula C₁₀H₂₀:\n*   c (number of carbons) = 10\n*   h (number of hydrogens) = 20\n\nIHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1\nIHD = 10 - 10 + 1\nIHD = 1\n\nAlternatively, the IHD can be determined by counting the number of rings and π-bonds in the structure. The product is a substituted cyclohexane.\n*   Number of rings = 1\n*   Number of π bonds (double or triple bonds) = 0\n\nTherefore, the IHD = 1.\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\nHere is a thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Reactant Name:** The starting material is \"2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid\". To understand its properties, we need to identify its structural features.\n    *   `cyclohex...`: This tells us there is a six-membered carbon ring. A ring itself contributes 1 to the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD).\n    *   `...-3-ene...`: The 'ene' indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) within the ring. This double bond adds another 1 to the IHD.\n    *   `...carboxylic acid`: This is a -COOH functional group. It contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This double bond adds 1 to the IHD.\n    *   `2-formyl...`: A formyl group is an aldehyde, -CHO. It also contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This adds 1 to the IHD.\n    *   `5-vinyl...`: A vinyl group is -CH=CH2. It contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). This adds another 1 to the IHD.\n\n2.  **Calculate the IHD of the Reactant (Optional but helpful):**\n    *   IHD from the ring: 1\n    *   IHD from C=C in the ring: 1\n    *   IHD from C=O in the acid: 1\n    *   IHD from C=O in the aldehyde: 1\n    *   IHD from C=C in the vinyl group: 1\n    *   Total IHD of the reactant = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction:** The reactant is treated with \"red phosphorus and excess of HI\". This is a very powerful reducing agent used in organic chemistry.\n    *   **Effect on Functional Groups:** This reagent is known for its ability to reduce most oxygen-containing functional groups completely to the corresponding hydrocarbon part.\n        *   Carboxylic acids (-COOH) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH3).\n        *   Aldehydes (-CHO) are also reduced to methyl groups (-CH3).\n    *   **Effect on Double Bonds:** It also reduces (saturates) carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n    *   **Overall Transformation:** Essentially, the reaction removes all pi bonds (both C=C and C=O) and all oxygen atoms from the molecule, leaving behind a saturated hydrocarbon skeleton.\n\n4.  **Determine the Structure of the Product:**\n    *   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring (the C=C is reduced).\n    *   The `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) is reduced, leaving its carbon attached to the ring.\n    *   The `formyl` group (-CHO) is reduced, leaving its carbon attached to the ring.\n    *   The `vinyl` group (-CH=CH2) becomes an `ethyl` group (-CH2-CH3) as its C=C bond is reduced.\n    *   The final product is a substituted cyclohexane. It's a fully saturated molecule (no double or triple bonds).\n\n5.  **Calculate the IHD of the Product:**\n    *   The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, is calculated as: IHD = (Number of Rings) + (Number of Pi Bonds).\n    *   In the product molecule:\n        *   **Number of Rings:** The six-membered ring structure is preserved. So, Number of Rings = 1.\n        *   **Number of Pi Bonds:** All double bonds (C=C and C=O) from the original molecule were reduced to single bonds. So, Number of Pi Bonds = 0.\n    *   Therefore, the IHD of the product = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\n6.  **Match with Options:** The calculated IHD is 1.

Let's break down its structure to identify all sources of unsaturation (rings and pi bonds).\n*   **cyclohex-**: This indicates a six-membered ring structure. A ring contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **-3-ene**: This indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) within the ring. A double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A vinyl group is -CH=CH₂, which contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). This double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **2-formyl**: A formyl group is an aldehyde (-CHO), which contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **carboxylic acid**: A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This double bond also contributes 1 to the IHD.\n\nSo, the total IHD of the starting material is 1 (ring) + 1 (ring C=C) + 1 (vinyl C=C) + 1 (formyl C=O) + 1 (carboxyl C=O) = 5.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the chemical reaction.**\nThe reagent used is **red phosphorus and excess of HI (hydroiodic acid)**. This is a very strong reducing agent. It is known for its ability to reduce almost all oxygen-containing functional groups and multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated hydrocarbon (alkane) form.\nThe effects of Red P / excess HI are:\n*   It reduces alkene double bonds (C=C) to alkane single bonds (C-C).\n*   It completely reduces aldehydes (-CHO) to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   It completely reduces carboxylic acids (-COOH) to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   It does not break the carbon-carbon single bonds that form the skeleton of the molecule, including the ring structure.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of the product.**\nApplying the effects of the reagent to our reactant:\n1.  The **cyclohex-3-ene** ring will be reduced to a **cyclohexane** ring (the C=C double bond becomes a C-C single bond).\n2.  The **vinyl group** (-CH=CH₂) will be reduced to an **ethyl group** (-CH₂-CH₃).\n3.  The **formyl group** (-CHO) at position 2 will be reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n4.  The **carboxylic acid group** (-COOH) at position 1 will be reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane. Specifically, it is 5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane. The key point is that it is a saturated cycloalkane; all double bonds have been eliminated.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product.**\nThe IHD (or degree of unsaturation) is calculated as:\nIHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds)\n\nFor the final product (a substituted cyclohexane):\n*   **Number of rings**: The cyclohexane ring is still present. So, the number of rings is 1.\n*   **Number of pi bonds**: The reaction has reduced all C=C and C=O double bonds to single bonds. Therefore, the number of pi bonds in the product is 0.\n\nTotal IHD of the product = 1 (from the ring) + 0 (from pi bonds) = 1.\n\n**Summary of careful points:**\n*   Correctly identify all sources of unsaturation in the starting material (one ring, two C=C bonds, two C=O bonds).\n*   Recognize that Red P/HI is a powerful reducing agent that reduces all these unsaturations except for the ring structure itself.\n*   Understand that the final product is a saturated cycloalkane, which means it has no pi bonds but retains its single ring.\n*   Recall that the IHD is the sum of rings and pi bonds. A simple cycloalkane will always have an IHD of 1.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\nIHD_product = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency of the final product.\n\n**1.

So, x = 10.\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 in COOH + 1 in CHO = 3 oxygens.

Analyze the reaction conditions.**\n\n*   The reactant is treated with **red phosphorus (Red P) and excess hydroiodic acid (HI)**.\n*   This combination is a very powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. Its primary functions are:\n    *   Reduction of aldehydes and ketones to alkanes.\n    *   Reduction of carboxylic acids to alkanes.\n    *   Reduction of alcohols to alkanes.\n    *   Reduction of carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) and triple bonds to single bonds (C-C).\n    *   Removal of all oxygen atoms from the functional groups mentioned above.\n\n**3. Determine the structure and molecular formula of the product.**\n\n*   The reaction will reduce all the unsaturation and oxygen-containing functional groups in the starting molecule.\n*   The **C=C double bond** in the cyclohexene ring will be reduced to a C-C single bond.\n*   The **C=C double bond** in the vinyl group will be reduced, converting the vinyl group (-CH=CH2) into an ethyl group (-CH2-CH3).\n*   The **formyl group** (-CHO) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The **carboxylic acid group** (-COOH) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   All oxygen atoms will be eliminated.\n*   The initial C10 carbon skeleton remains, but it becomes fully saturated.\n*   The product is a substituted cyclohexane ring. It is a saturated cycloalkane containing 10 carbon atoms.\n*   The general formula for a cycloalkane (an alkane with one ring) is **CnH2n**.\n*   Since our product has 10 carbon atoms (n=10), its molecular formula is **C10H(2*10) = C10H20**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the final product.**\n\n*   The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, tells us the sum of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n*   The formula for IHD for a molecule with formula CxHy is: **IHD = C - (H/2) + 1**.\n*   For our product with the formula **C10H20**:\n    *   IHD = 10 - (20 / 2) + 1\n    *   IHD = 10 - 10 + 1\n    *   IHD = 1\n\n*   This result is consistent with the structure of the product. The product is a substituted cyclohexane, which contains one ring (IHD = 1) and no double or triple bonds.\n\nTherefore, the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\nTo determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product, we first need to understand the starting material and the reaction it undergoes.\n\n### 1. The Reactant and its IHD\n\nThe starting compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's determine its molecular formula and IHD.\n*   **Cyclohexene ring**: A six-membered ring with one double bond. This contributes 1 (for the ring) + 1 (for the double bond) = 2 to the IHD.\n*   **Carboxylic acid group (-COOH)**: Contains one C=O double bond, contributing 1 to the IHD.\n*   **Formyl group (-CHO)**: Contains one C=O double bond, contributing 1 to the IHD.\n*   **Vinyl group (-CH=CH2)**: Contains one C=C double bond, contributing 1 to the IHD.\n\nThe total IHD of the reactant is the sum of these contributions: 1 (ring) + 1 (ring C=C) + 1 (carboxyl C=O) + 1 (formyl C=O) + 1 (vinyl C=C) = 5.\n\nAlternatively, we can determine its molecular formula:\n*   Carbons (C): 6 (in the ring) + 1 (from -COOH) + 1 (from -CHO) + 2 (from -CH=CH2) = 10 carbons.\n*   Oxygens (O): 2 (from -COOH) + 1 (from -CHO) = 3 oxygens.\n*   Hydrogens (H): By drawing the structure and counting, we find there are 12 hydrogens.\n*   The molecular formula is C₁₀H₁₂O₃.\n\nThe IHD can be calculated using the formula: IHD = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1 (where O does not affect the calculation).\nIHD = 10 - (12/2) + 1 = 10 - 6 + 1 = 5.\n\n### 2. The Reaction\n\nThe reagent used is red phosphorus with an excess of hydroiodic acid (Red P + excess HI). This is a very powerful reducing agent known for the complete reduction of several oxygen-containing functional groups and carbon-carbon multiple bonds. Specifically:\n*   Carboxylic acids (-COOH) are reduced to alkanes (-CH₃).\n*   Aldehydes (-CHO) are reduced to alkanes (-CH₃).\n*   Carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) are reduced to single bonds (C-C).\n\n### 3. The Product and its IHD\n\nApplying this to our reactant:\n*   The -COOH group is reduced to a -CH₃ group, removing the C=O double bond (IHD change of -1).\n*   The -CHO group is reduced to a -CH₃ group, removing the C=O double bond (IHD change of -1).\n*   The C=C double bond within the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a C-C single bond (IHD change of -1).\n*   The C=C double bond in the vinyl group is reduced to a C-C single bond, converting it to an ethyl group (IHD change of -1).\n\nThe original cyclohexane ring structure remains. A ring itself corresponds to an IHD of 1. Since all the double bonds (both C=O and C=C) have been removed, the only feature contributing to the IHD in the final product is the cyclohexane ring.\n\nThe final product is 1-ethyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohexane. Its molecular formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n\nLet's calculate the IHD for the product:\n*   Using the structure: The product is a cycloalkane, which contains one ring and no double or triple bonds. Therefore, its IHD is 1.\n*   Using the molecular formula (C₁₀H₂₀): IHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1 = 10 - 10 + 1 = 1.\n\nThus, the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nTo determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the final product, we must first understand the starting material and the nature of the chemical reaction.\n\n### 1.

The Reaction\n\nThe reactant is treated with red phosphorus (P) and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination is a powerful reducing agent. Its effects on the functional groups present in the starting molecule are as follows:\n*   It reduces carboxylic acids completely to alkanes (R-COOH → R-CH₃).\n*   It reduces aldehydes completely to alkanes (R-CHO → R-CH₃).\n*   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (alkenes) to single bonds (C=C → C-C).\n\n### 3. The Product\n\nApplying these reductions to the starting material:\n*   The carboxylic acid group becomes a methyl group.\n*   The formyl group becomes a methyl group.\n*   The double bond within the cyclohexene ring is saturated.\n*   The double bond in the vinyl group is saturated, converting it to an ethyl group.\n\nThe original cyclohexane ring structure remains, but all double bonds and oxygen-containing groups are removed. The final product is a saturated substituted cyclohexane. Specifically, it is 1-ethyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohexane (the exact numbering can vary with IUPAC nomenclature, but the molecular formula is key).\n\nThe product has 10 carbon atoms (no carbons are lost). Since it's a saturated cycloalkane, its general formula is CₙH₂ₙ. Therefore, the molecular formula of the product is **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\n### 4. Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) Calculation\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (also known as degrees of unsaturation) indicates the total number of rings and π (pi) bonds in a molecule.\n\nThe formula for IHD is:\nIHD = C - (H/2) + 1\nWhere C is the number of carbon atoms and H is the number of hydrogen atoms.\n\nFor the product C₁₀H₂₀:\nIHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1\nIHD = 10 - 10 + 1\nIHD = 1\n\nThis IHD value of 1 corresponds to the single ring of the cyclohexane structure.

The molecular formula is C₁₀H₁₂O₃.\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) for the reactant can be calculated as:\nIHD = C - (H/2) + (N/2) + 1  (Oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation).\nIHD = 10 - (12/2) + 1 = 10 - 6 + 1 = 5.\nThis IHD of 5 corresponds to one ring, three double bonds (one in the ring, one in the vinyl group, one in the formyl group), and the C=O of the carboxylic acid (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5).\n\n### 2. The Reaction\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess hydroiodic acid (Red P + HI)**. This combination is a powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. It is known to reduce various functional groups to alkanes:\n*   Aldehydes (-CHO) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   Carboxylic acids (-COOH) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   Carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) are reduced to single bonds (C-C).\n\n### 3.

Understand the Reactant**\n\nThe reactant is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's break down its structure to determine its molecular formula and initial IHD.\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: This is a six-membered carbon ring with one double bond between carbons 3 and 4. A ring itself counts as one degree of unsaturation. The double bond adds another.\n*   **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**: This group is at position 1. It contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), which adds one degree of unsaturation.\n*   **formyl group (-CHO)**: This aldehyde group is at position 2. It also contains a C=O double bond, adding another degree of unsaturation.\n*   **vinyl group (-CH=CH2)**: This group is at position 5. It contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), which adds one degree of unsaturation.\n\nLet's calculate the molecular formula of the reactant:\n*   The basic cyclohexene ring (C6H10) has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 5, so we need to remove hydrogens from those positions to add the groups. Let's build the molecule systematically.\n*   Number of Carbon atoms (C):\n    *   6 in the cyclohexene ring\n    *   1 in the carboxylic acid group (-COOH)\n    *   1 in the formyl group (-CHO)\n    *   2 in the vinyl group (-CH=CH2)\n    *   Total C = 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10\n*   Number of Hydrogen atoms (H):\n    *   The unsubstituted cyclohex-3-ene ring would be C6H10. Let's count the hydrogens on the substituted ring:\n        *   C1: bonded to -COOH, C2, and C6 -> 1 H\n        *   C2: bonded to -CHO, C1, and C3 -> 1 H\n        *   C3: part of C=C, bonded to C2 and C4 -> 1 H\n        *   C4: part of C=C, bonded to C3 and C5 -> 1 H\n        *   C5: bonded to -vinyl, C4, and C6 -> 1 H\n        *   C6: bonded to C1 and C5 -> 2 H\n    *   Total H on the ring = 1+1+1+1+1+2 = 7 H.\n    *   Hydrogens in the substituents:\n        *   -COOH: 1 H\n        *   -CHO: 1 H\n        *   -CH=CH2: 3 H\n    *   Total H = 7 (ring) + 1 (acid) + 1 (aldehyde) + 3 (vinyl) = 12 H.\n*   Number of Oxygen atoms (O):\n    *   2 in the carboxylic acid group\n    *   1 in the formyl group\n    *   Total O = 2 + 1 = 3 O.\n*   The molecular formula of the reactant is **C10H12O3**.\n\nNow, let's calculate the IHD of the reactant to verify. The formula for IHD is:\nIHD = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2), where X is halogens and N is nitrogen. Oxygen does not affect the calculation.\nIHD_reactant = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 11 - 6 = 5.\n\nThis matches our structural analysis: 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C in ring) + 1 (C=C in vinyl) + 1 (C=O in acid) + 1 (C=O in aldehyde) = 5.\n\n**2. Understand the Reaction**\n\nThe reagent is red phosphorus (Red P) with an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI). This is a very powerful reducing agent.

Determine the Product**\n\nApplying the effects of Red P/HI to the reactant:\n*   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a saturated `cyclohexane` ring.\n*   The `carboxylic acid` group at C1 becomes a `methyl` group.\n*   The `formyl` group at C2 becomes a `methyl` group.\n*   The `vinyl` group at C5 becomes an `ethyl` group (-CH2CH3).\n\nThe product is a substituted cyclohexane. Let's find its molecular formula.\n*   **Carbon atoms:** The number of carbon atoms does not change during this reduction. So, the product still has **10 carbon atoms**.\n*   **Structure:** The product is a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon (an alkyl-substituted cyclohexane). The general formula for such a compound (one ring, no other unsaturation) is **CnH2n**.\n*   Since n=10, the molecular formula of the product is **C10H20**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nWe can calculate the IHD for the product in two ways:\n\n*   **Method 1: Using the molecular formula (C10H20)**\n    IHD_product = C + 1 - (H/2) = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\n*   **Method 2: Using the structure of the product**\n    The IHD is the sum of the number of rings and the number of pi (π) bonds.\n    *   Number of rings = 1 (the cyclohexane ring).\n    *   Number of π bonds = 0 (all double bonds have been reduced to single bonds).\n    *   IHD_product = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nBoth methods yield an IHD of 1 for the product.\n\n**5.

Therefore, its IHD is 1.\n\nThe correct answer is 1.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
