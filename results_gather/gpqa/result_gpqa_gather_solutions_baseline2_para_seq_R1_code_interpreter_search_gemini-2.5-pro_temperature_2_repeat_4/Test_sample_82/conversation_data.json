Calculate the Concentration of Acetic Acid After Dilution**\n\nFirst, the initial 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. We need to find the new concentration of the acetic acid solution before titration begins.\n\n*   Initial Molarity (M₁) = 0.05 M\n*   Initial Volume (V₁) = 20.00 cm³\n*   Final Volume (V₂) = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   The new molarity (M₂) can be found using the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂.\n    M₂ = (M₁ * V₁) / V₂ = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M\n\nSo, the titration is performed on a 40.00 cm³ solution of 0.025 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n\n**2. Calculate the pH at 25% Titration**\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the weak acid (CH₃COOH) has been neutralized by the strong base (NaOH) to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). This creates a buffer solution containing both the weak acid and its conjugate base.\n\n*   The reaction is: CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n*   At this point, the ratio of the concentration of the conjugate base to the weak acid is [CH₃COO⁻]/[CH₃COOH] = 25/75 = 1/3.\n\nWe can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH of this buffer:\npH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n\n*   Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n*   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n\n**3. Calculate the pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been completely neutralized by the NaOH. The solution now contains only the salt, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa), which dissociates into Na⁺ and the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻). The acetate ion is a weak base and will hydrolyze water, making the solution basic.\n\n*   **Step a: Find the moles of acid.**\n    Moles of CH₃COOH = Molarity × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.040 L = 0.001 mol.\n\n*   **Step b: Find the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point.**\n    At equivalence, moles of NaOH = moles of CH₃COOH = 0.001 mol.\n    Volume of NaOH = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³.\n\n*   **Step c: Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) at the equivalence point.**\n    Total Volume = Volume of acid solution + Volume of NaOH added = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n    Concentration of CH₃COO⁻ = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n\n*   **Step d: Calculate the pH from the hydrolysis of the acetate ion.**\n    The hydrolysis reaction is: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n    We need the base dissociation constant (Kb) for the acetate ion.\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n    Now, we set up an ICE table for the hydrolysis, where x = [OH⁻]:\n    Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    Since Kb is very small, we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.\n    5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = x² / 0.02\n    x² = (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02 = 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    x = [OH⁻] = √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n\n*   **Step e: Calculate pOH and then pH.**\n    pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52\n\nThe pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\nThe calculated values are pH ≈ 4.26 at 25% titration and pH ≈ 8.52 at the equivalence point. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning for solving the problem:\n\n### **Part 1: Dilution of Acetic Acid**\n\nFirst, we need to determine the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted. The initial solution is 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and it's diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water.\n\n*   **Initial Volume (V₁):** 20.00 cm³\n*   **Initial Concentration (M₁):** 0.05 M\n*   **Final Volume (V₂):** 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   **Final Concentration (M₂):** ?\n\nWe use the dilution formula **M₁V₁ = M₂V₂**:\n(0.05 M) × (20.00 cm³) = M₂ × (40.00 cm³)\nM₂ = (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³\n**M₂ = 0.025 M**\n\nSo, the titration is performed on a 40.00 cm³ solution of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n### **Part 2: pH at 25% Titration**\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (CH₃COOH) has reacted with the NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), while 75% of the acetic acid remains unreacted. This creates a buffer solution.\n\nThe reaction is: **CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O**\n\nWe can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH of this buffer:\n**pH = pKa + log ( [A⁻] / [HA] )**\n\n1.  **Calculate pKa:**\n    *   Given Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n    *   pKa = -log₁₀(Ka) = -log₁₀(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n\n2.  **Determine the ratio [A⁻] / [HA]:**\n    *   [A⁻] corresponds to the 25% that has reacted.\n    *   [HA] corresponds to the 75% that remains.\n    *   The ratio is 25 / 75 = 1/3.\n\n3.  **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   pH = pKa + log(1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log(0.333...)\n    *   pH = 4.73 - 0.477\n    *   **pH ≈ 4.26**\n\n### **Part 3: pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the initial acetic acid has been completely neutralized by the NaOH, forming acetate ions (CH₃COO⁻) in the solution.\n\n1.  **Calculate initial moles of acetic acid:**\n    *   Moles = Concentration × Volume\n    *   Moles of CH₃COOH = 0.025 mol/L × (40.00 cm³ / 1000 cm³/L) = 0.001 mol\n\n2.  **Determine the volume of NaOH added:**\n    *   At equivalence, moles of NaOH = moles of CH₃COOH = 0.001 mol.\n    *   Volume NaOH = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³\n\n3.  **Calculate the total volume and concentration of acetate:**\n    *   Total Volume = Initial volume of acid solution + Volume of NaOH added\n    *   Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n    *   The moles of acetate formed are equal to the initial moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001 mol.\n    *   Concentration of acetate [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = **0.02 M**\n\n4.  **Calculate the pH of the acetate solution:**\n    *   Acetate is a weak base and hydrolyzes in water: **CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻**\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb. We can find it from Ka using the ion product of water (Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C).\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n    *   We set up an equilibrium expression: Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    *   Let x = [OH⁻]. Then: 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x). Assuming x is very small compared to 0.02, we get:\n    *   x² ≈ (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 ≈ 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] ≈ √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n\n5.  **Calculate pOH and then pH:**\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14.00 - 5.48 = **8.52**\n\nThe calculated values are pH ≈ 4.26 at 25% titration and pH ≈ 8.52 at the equivalence point. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\n**Detailed Step-by-Step Derivation:**\n\n**1. Calculate the Concentration of Acetic Acid After Dilution**\n\n*   **Initial state:** We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n*   **Dilution:** We add 20.00 cm³ of water.\n*   **Final volume (V₂):** 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³\n*   **Use the dilution formula (M₁V₁ = M₂V₂):**\n    *   M₁ = 0.05 M\n    *   V₁ = 20.00 cm³\n    *   V₂ = 40.00 cm³\n    *   M₂ = (M₁V₁) / V₂ = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = **0.025 M**\n*   So, the solution being titrated is 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n**2.

We use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    *   pH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[acid])\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85x10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n    *   At 25% titration, 25% of the acid has been converted to its conjugate base, and 75% remains as acid.

The solution contains 0.02 M acetate (calculated from moles of acid and total volume at equivalence). The acetate ion hydrolyzes water, making the solution basic.\n    *   CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n    *   We need Kb for acetate: Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0x10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85x10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41x10⁻¹⁰.\n    *   We can calculate the hydroxide concentration [OH⁻] using Kb = [OH⁻]² / [CH₃COO⁻].\n    *   [OH⁻] = √(Kb * [CH₃COO⁻]) = √(5.41x10⁻¹⁰ * 0.02) ≈ 3.29x10⁻⁶ M.\n    *   pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.29x10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48.\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52.\n\nThe calculated values are pH ≈ 4.26 at 25% titration and pH ≈ 8.52 at the equivalence point.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation (pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid])) is used. The pKa of acetic acid is -log(1.85x10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73. At 25% titration, the ratio of conjugate base (acetate) to remaining acid is 25%/75% = 1/3.\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log(1/3) ≈ 4.73 - 0.48 = 4.25. The code calculated a more precise value of **4.26**.\n\n3.  **pH at the Equivalence Point:** All the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming its conjugate base, acetate. The solution consists of acetate ions, which hydrolyze water to produce hydroxide (OH⁻), making the solution basic. The calculation involves finding the concentration of acetate, calculating Kb from Ka, and then determining the [OH⁻] to find the pOH and subsequently the pH.\n    *   The calculations, as performed by the code, yield a pH of **8.52**.\n\nThe calculated values are pH ≈ 4.26 at 25% titration and pH ≈ 8.52 at the equivalence point.

We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa + log([CH₃COO⁻] / [CH₃COOH])\n\n1.  **Find pKa**:\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n\n2.  **Determine the ratio of conjugate base to acid**:\n    At 25% titration, 25% of the initial acetic acid has been neutralized to form acetate (CH₃COO⁻), and the remaining 75% is still acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n    The ratio [CH₃COO⁻] / [CH₃COOH] = 25% / 75% = 1 / 3.\n\n3.  **Calculate the pH**:\n    pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n    pH = 4.733 - 0.477\n    pH ≈ 4.26\n\nThe pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n\n**Step 3: pH at the Equivalence Point**\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been completely neutralized by the NaOH to form sodium acetate (NaCH₃COO). The solution consists of the weak base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), which hydrolyzes in water to produce hydroxide ions (OH⁻).\n\nCH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n\n1.  **Calculate moles of acid and volume of base**:\n    *   Moles of acid = Concentration × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × (40.00 / 1000) L = 0.001 mol.\n    *   At the equivalence point, moles of base added = moles of acid = 0.001 mol.\n    *   Volume of NaOH added = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³.\n\n2.  **Calculate the concentration of acetate at the equivalence point**:\n    *   Total volume = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n    *   The moles of acetate formed equals the initial moles of acid, which is 0.001 mol.\n    *   [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n\n3.  **Calculate the [OH⁻] from hydrolysis**:\n    *   First, we need the base dissociation constant (Kb) for acetate: Kb = Kw / Ka, where Kw = 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴.\n    *   Kb = (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰.\n    *   Using the equilibrium expression for hydrolysis: Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻].\n    *   Let x = [OH⁻] = [CH₃COOH]. The equation becomes Kb ≈ x² / [CH₃COO⁻].\n    *   x² = Kb × [CH₃COO⁻] = (5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰) × (0.02 M) = 1.082 × 10⁻¹¹.\n    *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.082 × 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 × 10⁻⁶ M.\n\n4.  **Calculate pOH and then pH**:\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.29 × 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48.\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 ≈ 8.52.\n\nThe pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\nThe calculated values are a pH of 4.26 at 25% titration and a pH of 8.52 at the equivalence point. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere's the detailed thinking process to arrive at the solution.\n\n### **1. Understand the Initial State and the Dilution**\n\n*   **Initial solution:** We start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n*   **Dilution:** We add 20.00 cm³ of water. This doubles the volume of the solution while keeping the number of moles of acetic acid the same. We need to calculate the new concentration of the acetic acid.\n*   **Dilution Formula:** M₁V₁ = M₂V₂\n    *   M₁ (initial concentration) = 0.05 M\n    *   V₁ (initial volume) = 20.00 cm³\n    *   V₂ (final volume) = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n    *   M₂ (final concentration) = (M₁ * V₁) / V₂\n    *   M₂ = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M\n*   **Conclusion of Step 1:** We are titrating a 40.00 cm³ solution of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n### **2. Calculate the pH at 25% Titration**\n\n*   **Reaction:** The titration involves the neutralization of the weak acid (acetic acid, HA) with a strong base (NaOH). The net ionic equation is:\n    CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n*   **Buffer Region:** \"25% titration\" means we have added enough NaOH to neutralize 25% of the initial acetic acid. At this point, the solution contains:\n    *   75% of the original acetic acid (HA).\n    *   25% has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻, which is CH₃COO⁻).\n*   **Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation:** A solution containing a weak acid and its conjugate base is a buffer. Its pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    pH = pKa + log([A⁻] / [HA])\n*   **Calculate pKa:**\n    *   Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵)\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   The ratio of concentrations [A⁻]/[HA] is equal to the ratio of moles, which is 25/75 or 1/3.\n    *   pH = pKa + log(1/3)\n    *   pH = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) - log(3)\n    *   pH ≈ 4.7328 - 0.4771 ≈ 4.2557\n*   **Conclusion of Step 2:** The pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26.\n\n### **3. Calculate the pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n*   **Definition:** The equivalence point is reached when the moles of added NaOH are exactly equal to the initial moles of acetic acid.\n*   **Solution Composition:** At this point, all the CH₃COOH has been converted to its conjugate base, CH₃COO⁻. The solution contains sodium acetate (Na⁺CH₃COO⁻) in water.\n*   **Hydrolysis:** The acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) is a weak base and will react with water (hydrolyze) to produce OH⁻ ions, making the solution basic.\n    CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n*   **Calculation Steps:**\n    1.  **Find the moles of acid:**\n        *   Moles = Molarity × Volume (in Liters)\n        *   Moles CH₃COOH = 0.025 mol/L × (40.00 cm³ / 1000 L/cm³) = 0.001 mol\n    2.  **Find the volume of NaOH needed:**\n        *   At equivalence, moles NaOH = moles CH₃COOH = 0.001 mol.\n        *   Volume NaOH = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³.\n    3.  **Find the total volume and concentration of acetate at equivalence:**\n        *   Total Volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n        *   Moles of acetate (CH₃COO⁻) = initial moles of acid = 0.001 mol.\n        *   [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n    4.  **Calculate [OH⁻] from hydrolysis:**\n        *   First, we need Kb for the acetate ion. We use the relationship Kw = Ka × Kb, where Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C.\n        *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n        *   For the hydrolysis reaction, Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻].\n        *   Let x = [OH⁻]. Then [CH₃COOH] also equals x.\n        *   Kb = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x). Since Kb is very small, we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.\n        *   x² = Kb × 0.02 = (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 ≈ 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹.\n        *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n    5.  **Calculate pOH and then pH:**\n        *   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483.\n        *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 = 8.517.\n*   **Conclusion of Step 3:** The pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52.\n\n### **Summary of Results**\n\n*   pH at 25% titration ≈ 4.26\n*   pH at equivalence point ≈ 8.52\n\nComparing this to the given options:\nA) 4.26; 8.52\nB) 4.73; 7.00\nC) 3.17; 6.73\nD) 4.57; 6.92\n\nThe calculated values perfectly match option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n**Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Initial State and Dilution:**\n    *   First, we determine the initial moles of acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n        *   Initial Volume (V_acid) = 20.00 cm³ = 0.0200 L\n        *   Initial Concentration (C_acid) = 0.05 M\n        *   Moles of CH₃COOH = V_acid × C_acid = 0.0200 L × 0.05 mol/L = 0.001 mol.\n    *   The acetic acid solution is then diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water.\n        *   New Volume (V_total) = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³ = 0.0400 L.\n    *   The new concentration of the acetic acid solution before titration begins is:\n        *   New Concentration (C'_acid) = Moles of CH₃COOH / V_total = 0.001 mol / 0.0400 L = 0.025 M.\n\n2.  **pH at 25% Titration:**\n    *   Titration involves the reaction: CH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COONa + H₂O.\n    *   At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), and 75% of the acetic acid remains unreacted.\n    *   This creates a buffer solution containing a weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻).\n    *   The pH of a buffer is calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[acid]).\n    *   First, calculate the pKa of acetic acid:\n        *   Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n        *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n    *   At 25% titration, the ratio of the moles (and thus concentrations) of the conjugate base to the acid is [CH₃COO⁻]/[CH₃COOH] = 25/75 = 1/3.\n    *   Now, substitute the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n        *   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n        *   pH = 4.733 - 0.477\n        *   pH ≈ 4.256\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH is **4.26**.\n\n3.  **pH at the Equivalence Point:**\n    *   At the equivalence point, all 0.001 mol of acetic acid has been completely neutralized by NaOH.

The solution now contains only the salt, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa), which dissociates into Na⁺ and the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻). The acetate ion is a weak base and will hydrolyze water, making the solution basic.\n\n*   **Step a: Find the moles of acid.**\n    Moles of CH₃COOH = Molarity × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.040 L = 0.001 mol.\n\n*   **Step b: Find the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point.**\n    At equivalence, moles of NaOH = moles of CH₃COOH = 0.001 mol.\n    Volume of NaOH = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³.\n\n*   **Step c: Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) at the equivalence point.**\n    Total Volume = Volume of acid solution + Volume of NaOH added = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n    Concentration of CH₃COO⁻ = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n\n*   **Step d: Calculate the pH from the hydrolysis of the acetate ion.**\n    The hydrolysis reaction is: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n    We need the base dissociation constant (Kb) for the acetate ion.\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n    Now, we set up an ICE table for the hydrolysis, where x = [OH⁻]:\n    Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    Since Kb is very small, we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.\n    5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = x² / 0.02\n    x² = (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02 = 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    x = [OH⁻] = √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n\n*   **Step e: Calculate pOH and then pH.**\n    pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52\n\nThe pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\nThe calculated values are pH ≈ 4.26 at 25% titration and pH ≈ 8.52 at the equivalence point. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning for solving the problem:\n\n### **Part 1: Dilution of Acetic Acid**\n\nFirst, we need to determine the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted. The initial solution is 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and it's diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water.\n\n*   **Initial Volume (V₁):** 20.00 cm³\n*   **Initial Concentration (M₁):** 0.05 M\n*   **Final Volume (V₂):** 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   **Final Concentration (M₂):** ?\n\nWe use the dilution formula **M₁V₁ = M₂V₂**:\n(0.05 M) × (20.00 cm³) = M₂ × (40.00 cm³)\nM₂ = (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³\n**M₂ = 0.025 M**\n\nSo, the titration is performed on a 40.00 cm³ solution of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n### **Part 2: pH at 25% Titration**\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (CH₃COOH) has reacted with the NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), while 75% of the acetic acid remains unreacted. This creates a buffer solution.\n\nThe reaction is: **CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O**\n\nWe can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH of this buffer:\n**pH = pKa + log ( [A⁻] / [HA] )**\n\n1.  **Calculate pKa:**\n    *   Given Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n    *   pKa = -log₁₀(Ka) = -log₁₀(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n\n2.  **Determine the ratio [A⁻] / [HA]:**\n    *   [A⁻] corresponds to the 25% that has reacted.\n    *   [HA] corresponds to the 75% that remains.\n    *   The ratio is 25 / 75 = 1/3.\n\n3.  **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   pH = pKa + log(1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log(0.333...)\n    *   pH = 4.73 - 0.477\n    *   **pH ≈ 4.26**\n\n### **Part 3: pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the initial acetic acid has been completely neutralized by the NaOH, forming acetate ions (CH₃COO⁻) in the solution.\n\n1.  **Calculate initial moles of acetic acid:**\n    *   Moles = Concentration × Volume\n    *   Moles of CH₃COOH = 0.025 mol/L × (40.00 cm³ / 1000 cm³/L) = 0.001 mol\n\n2.  **Determine the volume of NaOH added:**\n    *   At equivalence, moles of NaOH = moles of CH₃COOH = 0.001 mol.\n    *   Volume NaOH = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³\n\n3.  **Calculate the total volume and concentration of acetate:**\n    *   Total Volume = Initial volume of acid solution + Volume of NaOH added\n    *   Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n    *   The moles of acetate formed are equal to the initial moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001 mol.\n    *   Concentration of acetate [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = **0.02 M**\n\n4.  **Calculate the pH of the acetate solution:**\n    *   Acetate is a weak base and hydrolyzes in water: **CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻**\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb. We can find it from Ka using the ion product of water (Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C).\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n    *   We set up an equilibrium expression: Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    *   Let x = [OH⁻]. Then: 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x). Assuming x is very small compared to 0.02, we get:\n    *   x² ≈ (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 ≈ 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] ≈ √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n\n5.  **Calculate pOH and then pH:**\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14.00 - 5.48 = **8.52**\n\nThe calculated values are pH ≈ 4.26 at 25% titration and pH ≈ 8.52 at the equivalence point. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\n**Detailed Step-by-Step Derivation:**\n\n**1. Calculate the Concentration of Acetic Acid After Dilution**\n\n*   **Initial state:** We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n*   **Dilution:** We add 20.00 cm³ of water.\n*   **Final volume (V₂):** 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³\n*   **Use the dilution formula (M₁V₁ = M₂V₂):**\n    *   M₁ = 0.05 M\n    *   V₁ = 20.00 cm³\n    *   V₂ = 40.00 cm³\n    *   M₂ = (M₁V₁) / V₂ = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = **0.025 M**\n*   So, the solution being titrated is 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n**2. Calculate the pH at 25% Titration**\n\n*   At any point during the titration before the equivalence point, we have a buffer solution containing both acetic acid (HA) and its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻).\n*   The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used for buffer pH calculations:\n    **pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])**\n*   **Calculate pKa:**\n    *   Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n    *   pKa = -log₁₀(Ka) = -log₁₀(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n*   **Determine the ratio of [A⁻]/[HA]:**\n    *   At 25% titration, 25% of the original acid (HA) has been converted into its conjugate base (A⁻), and 75% of the acid remains.\n    *   The ratio [A⁻]/[HA] is 25/75, which simplifies to 1/3.\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log₁₀(1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.73 - log₁₀(3)\n    *   pH = 4.73 - 0.477\n    *   **pH ≈ 4.26**\n\n**3. Calculate the pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n*   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH to form sodium acetate (CH₃COONa).

The solution contains sodium acetate (Na⁺CH₃COO⁻) in water.\n*   **Hydrolysis:** The acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) is a weak base and will react with water (hydrolyze) to produce OH⁻ ions, making the solution basic.\n    CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n*   **Calculation Steps:**\n    1.  **Find the moles of acid:**\n        *   Moles = Molarity × Volume (in Liters)\n        *   Moles CH₃COOH = 0.025 mol/L × (40.00 cm³ / 1000 L/cm³) = 0.001 mol\n    2.  **Find the volume of NaOH needed:**\n        *   At equivalence, moles NaOH = moles CH₃COOH = 0.001 mol.\n        *   Volume NaOH = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³.\n    3.  **Find the total volume and concentration of acetate at equivalence:**\n        *   Total Volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n        *   Moles of acetate (CH₃COO⁻) = initial moles of acid = 0.001 mol.\n        *   [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n    4.  **Calculate [OH⁻] from hydrolysis:**\n        *   First, we need Kb for the acetate ion. We use the relationship Kw = Ka × Kb, where Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C.\n        *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n        *   For the hydrolysis reaction, Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻].\n        *   Let x = [OH⁻]. Then [CH₃COOH] also equals x.\n        *   Kb = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x). Since Kb is very small, we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.\n        *   x² = Kb × 0.02 = (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 ≈ 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹.\n        *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n    5.  **Calculate pOH and then pH:**\n        *   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483.\n        *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 = 8.517.\n*   **Conclusion of Step 3:** The pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52.\n\n### **Summary of Results**\n\n*   pH at 25% titration ≈ 4.26\n*   pH at equivalence point ≈ 8.52\n\nComparing this to the given options:\nA) 4.26; 8.52\nB) 4.73; 7.00\nC) 3.17; 6.73\nD) 4.57; 6.92\n\nThe calculated values perfectly match option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n**Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Initial State and Dilution:**\n    *   First, we determine the initial moles of acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n        *   Initial Volume (V_acid) = 20.00 cm³ = 0.0200 L\n        *   Initial Concentration (C_acid) = 0.05 M\n        *   Moles of CH₃COOH = V_acid × C_acid = 0.0200 L × 0.05 mol/L = 0.001 mol.\n    *   The acetic acid solution is then diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water.\n        *   New Volume (V_total) = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³ = 0.0400 L.\n    *   The new concentration of the acetic acid solution before titration begins is:\n        *   New Concentration (C'_acid) = Moles of CH₃COOH / V_total = 0.001 mol / 0.0400 L = 0.025 M.\n\n2.  **pH at 25% Titration:**\n    *   Titration involves the reaction: CH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COONa + H₂O.\n    *   At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), and 75% of the acetic acid remains unreacted.\n    *   This creates a buffer solution containing a weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻).\n    *   The pH of a buffer is calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[acid]).\n    *   First, calculate the pKa of acetic acid:\n        *   Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n        *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n    *   At 25% titration, the ratio of the moles (and thus concentrations) of the conjugate base to the acid is [CH₃COO⁻]/[CH₃COOH] = 25/75 = 1/3.\n    *   Now, substitute the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n        *   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n        *   pH = 4.733 - 0.477\n        *   pH ≈ 4.256\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH is **4.26**.\n\n3.  **pH at the Equivalence Point:**\n    *   At the equivalence point, all 0.001 mol of acetic acid has been completely neutralized by NaOH. The solution now contains 0.001 mol of the salt, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa), which dissociates completely into Na⁺ and the weak base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻).\n    *   First, determine the volume of 0.1 M NaOH required to reach the equivalence point:\n        *   Moles of NaOH = Moles of CH₃COOH = 0.001 mol\n        *   Volume of NaOH = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³.\n    *   Calculate the total volume of the solution at the equivalence point:\n        *   Total Volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L.\n    *   Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion [CH₃COO⁻] at the equivalence point:\n        *   [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M.\n    *   The acetate ion is a weak base and hydrolyzes water: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻.\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate:\n        *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n    *   Set up an ICE table for the hydrolysis equilibrium to find the [OH⁻]:\n        *   Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n        *   Let x = [OH⁻] = [CH₃COOH]. Then, 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ = x² / (0.02 - x).\n    *   Since Kb is very small, we can assume x is negligible compared to 0.02, so (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n        *   5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ = x² / 0.02\n        *   x² = (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02 = 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\n        *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n    *   Calculate pOH and then pH:\n        *   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n        *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH is **8.52**.\n\nThe calculated values are pH ≈ 4.26 at 25% titration and pH ≈ 8.52 at the equivalence point. These values match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
