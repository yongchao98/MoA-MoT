Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions.\"\n\nTo solve this, I will analyze the problem in two parts: the thermodynamic aspect and the kinetic aspect.\n\n**1. Thermodynamic Aspect: Is oxygen a stronger or weaker oxidant in basic solutions?**\n\nThe strength of an oxidizing agent is quantified by its standard reduction potential (E°). A higher (more positive) E° value indicates a stronger oxidizing agent because the reduction reaction is more thermodynamically favorable.\n\nI need to compare the standard reduction potential of oxygen in acidic solution versus basic solution.\n\n*   **In acidic solution:** The half-reaction for the reduction of oxygen is:\n    O₂(g) + 4H⁺(aq) + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O(l)\n    The standard reduction potential for this reaction is E° = +1.23 V.\n\n*   **In basic solution:** The half-reaction for the reduction of oxygen is:\n    O₂(g) + 2H₂O(l) + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻(aq)\n    The standard reduction potential for this reaction is E° = +0.40 V.\n\nComparing the two E° values: +1.23 V (acidic) > +0.40 V (basic).\n\nSince the standard reduction potential of oxygen is lower in basic solution than in acidic solution, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions from a thermodynamic standpoint.\n\nThis fills in the first blank: \"Thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions.\"\n\n**2. Kinetic Aspect: Does oxygen react faster or slower in acidic solutions?**\n\nKinetics deals with the rate of a reaction. While thermodynamically favorable (as shown by the high E° in acidic solution), the reduction of oxygen involves breaking the strong O=O double bond and transferring four electrons. This multi-step process has a high activation energy, making the reaction kinetically slow under standard conditions. This is why many metals that should theoretically corrode (oxidize) in the presence of oxygen and acid do so very slowly. The reaction rate is often limited by the slow kinetics of oxygen reduction.\n\nTherefore, the reaction of oxygen is kinetically **slower** in acidic solutions (and in general).\n\nThis fills in the second blank: \"Kinetically, oxygen reacts **slower** in acidic solutions.\"\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nCombining the two parts, the complete statement is:\nThermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts **slower** in acidic solutions.\n\nThis corresponds to the \"weaker - slower\" combination.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThermodynamically, the strength of an oxidizing agent is determined by its standard reduction potential (E°). A higher E° indicates a stronger oxidizing agent.\n*   In acidic solution, the reduction of oxygen is: O₂(g) + 4H⁺(aq) + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O(l), with E° = +1.23 V.\n*   In basic solution, the reduction of oxygen is: O₂(g) + 2H₂O(l) + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻(aq), with E° = +0.40 V.\nSince +0.40 V is less than +1.23 V, oxygen is thermodynamically a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions compared to its strength in acidic solutions. This eliminates options A and B.\n\nKinetically, the rate of a reaction is determined by its activation energy. The reduction of oxygen involves the breaking of a strong O=O double bond and a complex multi-electron transfer process. This leads to a very high activation energy, making the reaction notoriously **slower** in practice, regardless of the thermodynamic favorability. This phenomenon is known as a high overpotential for oxygen reduction. Therefore, kinetically, oxygen reacts slowly.\n\nCombining these two points:\n*   Thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions.\n*   Kinetically, oxygen reacts **slower** in acidic solutions.\n\nThus, the correct combination is weaker – slower.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nBased on the information provided and general chemical principles, let's break down the problem.\n\n**Part 1: Thermodynamics**\n\n*   The question asks: \"Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions.\"\n*   Thermodynamic strength as an oxidizing agent is measured by the standard reduction potential (E°).

This multi-step process has a very high activation energy.\n*   A high activation energy means the reaction is kinetically slow, even if it is thermodynamically favorable (as indicated by the high E° of +1.23 V). This is why many thermodynamically spontaneous oxidation reactions do not occur at an appreciable rate without a catalyst or heat.\n*   Therefore, kinetically, oxygen is a **slower** reactant.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   The first blank should be **weaker**.\n*   The second blank should be **slower**.\n*   The correct combination is **weaker – slower**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis is an excellent electrochemistry question that tests understanding of both thermodynamics (potential) and kinetics (reaction rate). Let's break it down step-by-step.\n\n### Part 1: Thermodynamics\n\n*   **The Question:** \"Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions.\"\n*   **Reasoning:** The strength of an oxidizing agent is measured by its standard reduction potential (E°). A higher (more positive) E° means a stronger oxidant. We need to compare the E° of oxygen in basic solution to its E° in acidic solution.\n    *   In acidic solution: O₂(g) + 4H⁺(aq) + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O(l) has **E° = +1.23 V**.\n    *   In basic solution: O₂(g) + 2H₂O(l) + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻(aq) has **E° = +0.40 V**.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since +0.40 V is less than +1.23 V, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions than it is in acidic solutions.\n*   **Elimination:** This eliminates options B and C, as they both start with \"stronger\". We are left with options A and D.\n\n### Part 2: Kinetics\n\n*   **The Question:** \"Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions.\"\n*   **Reasoning:** This part deals with the *speed* of the reaction. The sentence structure (\"...in basic solutions. ...in acidic solutions.\") strongly implies a comparison between the two conditions.\n    *   The reduction of oxygen involves breaking the very stable O=O double bond, which requires a high activation energy. This makes the reaction kinetically slow in general, which is why oxygen doesn't spontaneously combust everything around us despite being a strong oxidant.\n    *   However, when comparing the reaction rate in acidic versus basic media, the reaction is generally **faster** in acidic solutions. The presence of protons (H⁺) facilitates the reaction pathways, and many catalysts used for this reaction are more effective in acidic environments. This is a crucial concept in technologies like fuel cells, where the oxygen reduction reaction is a key step.\n*   **Conclusion:** Kinetically, oxygen reacts **faster** in acidic solutions compared to basic solutions.\n\n### Final Combination\n\n*   Thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions.\n*   Kinetically, oxygen reacts **faster** in acidic solutions.\n\nThis corresponds to the combination **weaker - faster**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis problem has two parts: one about thermodynamics and one about kinetics.\n\n**Part 1: Thermodynamics**\n*   Thermodynamics in electrochemistry is about the potential (spontaneity) of a reaction, measured by the standard reduction potential (E°). A substance with a higher (more positive) E° is a stronger oxidizing agent.\n*   The provided information gives us the reduction potentials for oxygen:\n    *   In acidic solution: E° = +1.23 V\n    *   In basic solution: E° = +0.40 V\n*   Since +0.40 V is less than +1.23 V, oxygen has a lower reduction potential in basic solution. This means it is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solution compared to acidic solution.\n*   This conclusion eliminates options A and C.\n\n**Part 2: Kinetics**\n*   Kinetics is about the *rate* of a reaction. The question asks whether oxygen reacts faster or slower in acidic solutions.\n*   The reduction of oxygen is known to be kinetically slow (it has a high activation energy), which is a major challenge in technologies like fuel cells.\n*   However, when comparing the reaction rates in acidic versus basic media on many common catalysts (like platinum), the reaction is generally considered to be **faster** in acidic solutions. The mechanism involving protons (H⁺) is often more efficient than the mechanism in basic media.\n*   Therefore, the second part of the statement should be \"faster\".\n\n**Combining the two parts:**\n*   Thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions.\n*   Kinetically, oxygen reacts **faster** in acidic solutions.\n\nThis corresponds to the \"weaker – faster\" combination.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### Part 1: Thermodynamics of Oxygen as an Oxidant\n\n1.  **Define Oxidant Strength:** The strength of an oxidizing agent (oxidant) is measured by its standard reduction potential (E°). A substance with a more positive E° is a stronger oxidant because it has a greater tendency to be reduced (i.e., accept electrons).\n\n2.  **Identify the Relevant Half-Reactions:** We need to compare the standard reduction potential for oxygen in both acidic and basic solutions.\n    *   **In acidic solution:** The reduction of oxygen produces water.\n        O₂(g) + 4H⁺(aq) + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O(l)\n        The standard reduction potential for this reaction is **E° = +1.23 V**.\n    *   **In basic solution:** The reduction of oxygen produces hydroxide ions.\n        O₂(g) + 2H₂O(l) + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻(aq)\n        The standard reduction potential for this reaction is **E° = +0.40 V**.\n\n3.  **Compare the Potentials:**\n    *   E°(acidic) = +1.23 V\n    *   E°(basic) = +0.40 V\n    Since +0.40 V is less positive than +1.23 V, oxygen has a lower tendency to be reduced in basic solution compared to acidic solution.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Thermodynamics:** Thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions than it is in acidic solutions. This eliminates options A and B, leaving C and D as possibilities.\n\n### Part 2: Kinetics of Oxygen Reaction\n\n1.  **Define Kinetics:** Kinetics deals with the rate of a chemical reaction, which is determined by factors like activation energy. A reaction can be thermodynamically favorable (i.e., have a large positive E°) but proceed very slowly if it has a high activation energy.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Oxygen Reduction Reaction:** The reduction of molecular oxygen (O₂) to water (in acid) or hydroxide (in base) is a complex process.\n    *   **Bond Strength:** It requires breaking the very strong O=O double bond, which requires a significant amount of energy.\n    *   **Electron Transfer:** It is a four-electron transfer process. Multi-electron transfers rarely happen in a single step. Instead, they proceed through a series of one- or two-electron steps, often forming unstable intermediates.\n\n3.  **Activation Energy:** Due to the strong bond and the complex multi-step mechanism, the overall reaction has a very high activation energy. A high activation energy means that the reaction rate is very slow under normal conditions.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Kinetics:** The statement refers to the kinetic behavior of oxygen in acidic solutions. Despite being a very strong oxidant thermodynamically in acid (E° = +1.23 V), its reaction is known to be kinetically hindered, or **slower**. This is a fundamental concept in electrochemistry, explaining why expensive catalysts (like platinum) are needed in applications like fuel cells to speed up this sluggish reaction.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\n*   From Part 1, the first blank is **weaker**.\n*   From Part 2, the second blank is **slower**.\n\nPutting them together, the correct combination is \"weaker – slower\".\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\n*   **Step 1: Analyze the thermodynamic aspect of the statement.**\n    The first part of the statement is: \"Thermodynamically, oxygen is a ______ oxidant in basic solutions.\"\n    The strength of an oxidizing agent (oxidant) is measured by its standard reduction potential (E°). A higher, more positive E° value indicates a stronger oxidant.

This means that oxygen is a much stronger oxidant in acidic solution than it is in basic solution. Therefore, thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions. This eliminates options A and B.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the kinetic aspect of the statement.**\n    The second part of the statement is: \"Kinetically, oxygen reacts ______ in acidic solutions.\"\n    Kinetics deals with the rate of a reaction. Even if a reaction is thermodynamically favorable (i.e., has a positive E° value), it may proceed very slowly if it has a high activation energy.\n\n    *   The reduction of molecular oxygen (O₂) to water (H₂O) is a complex process. It requires the breaking of a strong O=O double bond.\n    *   Furthermore, it is a four-electron transfer process. Multi-electron transfer reactions rarely occur in a single step and usually proceed through a series of intermediates. This complex mechanism leads to a high activation energy.\n    *   Because of this high activation energy, the reduction of oxygen is notoriously slow, or \"kinetically sluggish.\" This is a well-known phenomenon in electrochemistry and is a major challenge in technologies like fuel cells.\n\n    Therefore, kinetically, oxygen reacts **slower**. This is true in both acidic and basic solutions, but the question specifically asks about acidic solutions.\n\n*   **Step 3: Combine the findings.**\n    *   From Step 1, the first blank is \"weaker\".\n    *   From Step 2, the second blank is \"slower\".\n\n    The correct combination is **weaker - slower**. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\n1.  **Analyze the first part of the statement (Thermodynamics):**\n    *   The term \"thermodynamically\" refers to the spontaneity of a reaction, which in electrochemistry is measured by the standard reduction potential (E°). A substance is a stronger oxidizing agent (oxidant) if it has a higher (more positive) E°.\n    *   The provided information shows the half-reactions for oxygen reduction:\n        *   In **acidic** solution: O₂(g) + 4H⁺(aq) + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O(l) with **E° = +1.23 V**\n        *   In **basic** solution: O₂(g) + 2H₂O(l) + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻(aq) with **E° = +0.40 V**\n    *   Since the reduction potential in basic solution (+0.40 V) is lower than in acidic solution (+1.23 V), oxygen has a weaker tendency to be reduced in basic solution.\n    *   Therefore, thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions. This eliminates options C and D.\n\n2.  **Analyze the second part of the statement (Kinetics):**\n    *   The term \"kinetically\" refers to the rate or speed of a reaction.\n    *   The reduction of molecular oxygen (O₂) is a complex reaction that requires the transfer of four electrons and the breaking of a strong O=O double bond. Processes like this generally have a very high activation energy.\n    *   Because of this high activation energy barrier, the reduction of oxygen is notoriously slow, or \"sluggish,\" in the absence of a catalyst. This is a well-known phenomenon in electrochemistry. This kinetic sluggishness occurs in both acidic and basic solutions.\n    *   Therefore, kinetically, oxygen reacts **slower** (or slowly).\n\n3.  **Combine the conclusions:**\n    *   The first blank is **weaker**.\n    *   The second blank is **slower**.\n    *   The correct combination is \"weaker - slower\".\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThe user wants me to complete the following statement:\n\"Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions.\"\n\nI need to determine whether oxygen is a stronger or weaker oxidant in basic solution and whether its reaction is faster or slower.\n\n**Part 1: Thermodynamics - Oxidizing strength of oxygen**\n\nThe strength of an oxidizing agent is determined by its standard reduction potential (E°). A higher (more positive) E° value indicates a stronger oxidizing agent.\n\nLet's look at the standard reduction potentials for oxygen in both acidic and basic solutions:\n\n1.  **Acidic solution:**\n    O₂(g) + 4H⁺(aq) + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O(l)\n    E° = +1.23 V\n\n2.  **Basic solution:**\n    O₂(g) + 2H₂O(l) + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻(aq)\n    E° = +0.40 V\n\nComparing the two E° values:\n+0.40 V (basic solution) < +1.23 V (acidic solution)\n\nSince the standard reduction potential of oxygen is lower in a basic solution than in an acidic solution, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions.\n\n**Part 2: Kinetics - Reaction speed of oxygen**\n\nThe reduction of oxygen (O₂) is a multi-electron transfer process. The O=O double bond is very strong (bond dissociation energy ≈ 498 kJ/mol) and requires a significant amount of energy to break. This high activation energy barrier makes the reduction of oxygen kinetically slow, a phenomenon often referred to as \"oxygen overpotential\". This is true in both acidic and basic solutions under many common conditions, especially in electrochemical cells where it is a common source of inefficiency. Therefore, kinetically, oxygen reacts **slower**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions.\n*   Kinetically, oxygen reacts **slower** (in general, including in acidic solutions).\n\nCombining these two findings, the correct pair is **weaker – slower**. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Part 1: Thermodynamic Analysis\n\nThe first part of the statement is: \"Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions.\"\n\n1.  **Definition of Oxidant Strength:** The strength of an oxidizing agent (oxidant) is measured by its standard reduction potential (E°). A substance with a more positive (or less negative) standard reduction potential is a stronger oxidizing agent because it has a greater tendency to be reduced.\n\n2.  **Oxygen Reduction Half-Reactions:** We need to compare the standard reduction potential of oxygen in acidic and basic solutions.\n\n    *   **In acidic solution:** The half-reaction is:\n        O₂(g) + 4H⁺(aq) + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O(l)\n        The standard reduction potential for this reaction is **E° = +1.23 V**.\n\n    *   **In basic solution:** The half-reaction is:\n        O₂(g) + 2H₂O(l) + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻(aq)\n        The standard reduction potential for this reaction is **E° = +0.40 V**.\n\n3.  **Comparison:** We compare the two E° values:\n    E°(acidic) = +1.23 V\n    E°(basic) = +0.40 V\n\n    Since +1.23 V > +0.40 V, oxygen has a greater thermodynamic tendency to be reduced in an acidic solution. Therefore, oxygen is a **stronger** oxidant in acidic solution and, consequently, a **weaker** oxidant in basic solution.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Part 1:** The first blank should be filled with \"weaker\".

A lower activation energy leads to a faster reaction rate.\n\n2.  **Kinetics of Oxygen Reduction:** The reduction of molecular oxygen (the Oxygen Reduction Reaction, or ORR) is known to be a kinetically complex and slow process. This is largely due to the high energy required to break the strong double bond in the O₂ molecule (bond dissociation energy ≈ 498 kJ/mol).\n\n3.  **Comparison of Rates in Acidic vs. Basic Solutions:**\n    *   While thermodynamically more favorable in acid (as shown by the higher E°), the reaction is generally **kinetically slower** in acidic media compared to basic media on many common electrode surfaces.\n    *   The reason for this is that the reaction mechanism involves multiple steps with high activation energy barriers. These barriers are often higher in acidic environments for the complete 4-electron reduction to water.\n    *   In electrochemistry, this slow kinetic behavior is observed as a large *overpotential*. The overpotential for the ORR is typically higher in acidic solutions than in basic solutions, which directly indicates slower kinetics.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Part 2:** Kinetically, oxygen reacts **slower** in acidic solutions compared to basic solutions.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nCombining the findings from both parts:\n\n*   Thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions.\n*   Kinetically, oxygen reacts **slower** in acidic solutions.\n\nThis combination corresponds to the option \"weaker – slower\".\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThe user wants to complete the following statement:\n\"Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions.

Since the reduction potential is lower in basic solution, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions compared to acidic solutions.\n\n2.  **Kinetic Aspect: Does oxygen react faster or slower in acidic solutions?**\n    Kinetics deals with the rate of a reaction. While thermodynamically favorable (high E°), the reduction of oxygen is known to be a kinetically slow process. This is because the O=O double bond is very strong (bond dissociation energy ≈ 498 kJ/mol) and must be broken for the reaction to proceed. This high activation energy makes the reaction slow under standard conditions without a catalyst.\n\n    The question asks about the reaction rate in acidic solutions. Although the reaction is generally slow, it is kinetically **slower** in acidic media compared to other conditions or in the presence of catalysts. The multi-electron transfer process (4 electrons) involves several intermediate steps, some of which have high activation barriers. For instance, the first step, the one-electron reduction to form the superoxide radical (O₂⁻), is thermodynamically unfavorable. The overall reaction proceeds, but slowly. Therefore, kinetically, oxygen reacts **slower** in acidic solutions.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions (E° = +0.40 V) than in acidic solutions (E° = +1.23 V).\n*   Kinetically, the reduction of oxygen is generally **slower**, particularly in acidic solutions without a catalyst, due to the high activation energy required to break the O=O bond.\n\nTherefore, the correct combination is **weaker** and **slower**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThe user's first question asked: \"Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions.

This eliminates options C and D.\n\n2.  **Kinetic Aspect (Second Blank): Does oxygen react slower or faster in acidic solutions?**\n    *   Kinetics refers to the speed of the reaction, which is determined by its activation energy.\n    *   The reduction of oxygen is a complex, multi-step process that involves breaking a strong O=O double bond. This gives it a high activation energy, making it a notoriously slow, or \"sluggish,\" reaction in general.\n    *   Despite having a stronger thermodynamic driving force (higher E°) in acidic solutions, the kinetic barriers (activation energy) for oxygen reduction are generally *higher* in acidic media compared to alkaline (basic) media, especially on non-noble metal catalysts.\n    *   This higher kinetic barrier means the reaction is **slower** in acidic solutions.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The first blank should be \"weaker\".\n    *   The second blank should be \"slower\".\n    *   The correct combination is \"weaker - slower\".

This means oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions compared to acidic solutions. This eliminates options B and C.\n\nKinetically, the reduction of oxygen is a notoriously slow reaction in electrochemistry. This is because the reaction involves the cleavage of a strong O=O double bond, which results in a high activation energy barrier. This slowness is a significant challenge in the development of fuel cells. The reaction is kinetically hindered and requires a significant overpotential (extra voltage beyond the thermodynamic potential) to proceed at a reasonable rate. Therefore, the reaction is considered **slower**, particularly when compared to its strong thermodynamic driving force in acidic solution.\n\nCombining the two findings:\n- Thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions.\n- Kinetically, oxygen reacts **slower** in acidic solutions.\n\nThis corresponds to the combination \"weaker - slower\".\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

This kinetic sluggishness occurs in both acidic and basic solutions.\n    *   Therefore, kinetically, oxygen reacts **slower** (or slowly).\n\n3.  **Combine the conclusions:**\n    *   The first blank is **weaker**.\n    *   The second blank is **slower**.\n    *   The correct combination is \"weaker - slower\".\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThe user wants me to complete the following statement:\n\"Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions.\"\n\nI need to determine whether oxygen is a stronger or weaker oxidant in basic solution and whether its reaction is faster or slower.\n\n**Part 1: Thermodynamics - Oxidizing strength of oxygen**\n\nThe strength of an oxidizing agent is determined by its standard reduction potential (E°). A higher (more positive) E° value indicates a stronger oxidizing agent.\n\nLet's look at the standard reduction potentials for oxygen in both acidic and basic solutions:\n\n1.  **Acidic solution:**\n    O₂(g) + 4H⁺(aq) + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O(l)\n    E° = +1.23 V\n\n2.  **Basic solution:**\n    O₂(g) + 2H₂O(l) + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻(aq)\n    E° = +0.40 V\n\nComparing the two E° values:\n+0.40 V (basic solution) < +1.23 V (acidic solution)\n\nSince the standard reduction potential of oxygen is lower in a basic solution than in an acidic solution, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions.\n\n**Part 2: Kinetics - Reaction speed of oxygen**\n\nThe reduction of oxygen (O₂) is a multi-electron transfer process. The O=O double bond is very strong (bond dissociation energy ≈ 498 kJ/mol) and requires a significant amount of energy to break. This high activation energy barrier makes the reduction of oxygen kinetically slow, a phenomenon often referred to as \"oxygen overpotential\". This is true in both acidic and basic solutions under many common conditions, especially in electrochemical cells where it is a common source of inefficiency. Therefore, kinetically, oxygen reacts **slower**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions.\n*   Kinetically, oxygen reacts **slower** (in general, including in acidic solutions).\n\nCombining these two findings, the correct pair is **weaker – slower**. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Part 1: Thermodynamic Analysis\n\nThe first part of the statement is: \"Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions.\"\n\n1.  **Definition of Oxidant Strength:** The strength of an oxidizing agent (oxidant) is measured by its standard reduction potential (E°). A substance with a more positive (or less negative) standard reduction potential is a stronger oxidizing agent because it has a greater tendency to be reduced.\n\n2.  **Oxygen Reduction Half-Reactions:** We need to compare the standard reduction potential of oxygen in acidic and basic solutions.\n\n    *   **In acidic solution:** The half-reaction is:\n        O₂(g) + 4H⁺(aq) + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O(l)\n        The standard reduction potential for this reaction is **E° = +1.23 V**.\n\n    *   **In basic solution:** The half-reaction is:\n        O₂(g) + 2H₂O(l) + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻(aq)\n        The standard reduction potential for this reaction is **E° = +0.40 V**.\n\n3.  **Comparison:** We compare the two E° values:\n    E°(acidic) = +1.23 V\n    E°(basic) = +0.40 V\n\n    Since +1.23 V > +0.40 V, oxygen has a greater thermodynamic tendency to be reduced in an acidic solution. Therefore, oxygen is a **stronger** oxidant in acidic solution and, consequently, a **weaker** oxidant in basic solution.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Part 1:** The first blank should be filled with \"weaker\". This eliminates options B and C, leaving us with A and D.\n\n### Part 2: Kinetic Analysis\n\nThe second part of the statement is: \"Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions.\"\n\n1.  **Definition of Kinetics:** Kinetics refers to the rate of a chemical reaction. \"Faster\" or \"slower\" describes the reaction rate, which is governed by the activation energy of the reaction pathway. A lower activation energy leads to a faster reaction rate.\n\n2.  **Kinetics of Oxygen Reduction:** The reduction of molecular oxygen (the Oxygen Reduction Reaction, or ORR) is known to be a kinetically complex and slow process. This is largely due to the high energy required to break the strong double bond in the O₂ molecule (bond dissociation energy ≈ 498 kJ/mol).\n\n3.  **Comparison of Rates in Acidic vs. Basic Solutions:**\n    *   While thermodynamically more favorable in acid (as shown by the higher E°), the reaction is generally **kinetically slower** in acidic media compared to basic media on many common electrode surfaces.\n    *   The reason for this is that the reaction mechanism involves multiple steps with high activation energy barriers. These barriers are often higher in acidic environments for the complete 4-electron reduction to water.\n    *   In electrochemistry, this slow kinetic behavior is observed as a large *overpotential*. The overpotential for the ORR is typically higher in acidic solutions than in basic solutions, which directly indicates slower kinetics.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Part 2:** Kinetically, oxygen reacts **slower** in acidic solutions compared to basic solutions.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nCombining the findings from both parts:\n\n*   Thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions.\n*   Kinetically, oxygen reacts **slower** in acidic solutions.\n\nThis combination corresponds to the option \"weaker – slower\".\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThe user wants to complete the following statement:\n\"Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions.\"\n\nTo answer this question, we need to analyze the thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of oxygen's role as an oxidizing agent.\n\n**Part 1: Thermodynamics**\n\nThermodynamic strength as an oxidant is determined by the standard reduction potential (E°). A more positive E° value indicates a stronger oxidant. We need to compare the reduction potential of oxygen in basic solutions to that in acidic solutions.\n\n*   **In acidic solution:** The reduction half-reaction is:\n    O₂(g) + 4H⁺(aq) + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O(l)\n    The standard reduction potential for this reaction is E° = +1.23 V.\n\n*   **In basic solution:** The reduction half-reaction is:\n    O₂(g) + 2H₂O(l) + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻(aq)\n    The standard reduction potential for this reaction is E° = +0.40 V.\n\nComparing the two E° values:\nE° (acidic, +1.23 V) > E° (basic, +0.40 V)\n\nThis means that oxygen is a thermodynamically stronger oxidant in acidic solution and a **weaker** oxidant in basic solution.\nTherefore, the first blank should be \"weaker\". This eliminates options C) and D).\n\n**Part 2: Kinetics**\n\nKinetics refers to the rate of a reaction. The statement asks about how fast oxygen reacts in acidic solutions.\n\n*   The reduction of a diatomic oxygen molecule (O₂) to water involves the transfer of four electrons and the breaking of a very strong double bond (bond dissociation energy ≈ 498 kJ/mol).\n*   Processes that involve multiple electron transfers and the breaking of strong covalent bonds typically have high activation energies.\n*   This high activation energy barrier makes the reduction of oxygen kinetically unfavorable, meaning the reaction is inherently **slower**. This is often referred to as a high overpotential for oxygen reduction. In practical applications like fuel cells, expensive catalysts (e.g., platinum) are required to speed up this sluggish reaction.\n\nTherefore, the second blank should be \"slower\".\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions.\n*   Kinetically, oxygen reacts **slower** in acidic solutions.\n\nThis corresponds to the combination \"weaker - slower\".\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nE° is the standard reduction potential, which is a measure of the tendency of a chemical species to be reduced, and therefore to act as an oxidizing agent. A higher (more positive) E° value indicates a stronger oxidizing agent.\n\n1.  **Thermodynamic Aspect: Is oxygen a stronger or weaker oxidant in basic solutions?**\n    To answer this, we need to compare the standard reduction potential of oxygen in acidic solution versus basic solution.\n\n    *   **In acidic solution:** The reduction half-reaction is:\n        O₂(g) + 4H⁺(aq) + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O(l)\n        The standard reduction potential (E°) for this reaction is **+1.23 V**.\n\n    *   **In basic solution:** The reduction half-reaction is:\n        O₂(g) + 2H₂O(l) + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻(aq)\n        The standard reduction potential (E°) for this reaction is **+0.40 V**.\n\n    Comparing the two E° values, +1.23 V (acidic) > +0.40 V (basic). Since the reduction potential is lower in basic solution, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions compared to acidic solutions.\n\n2.  **Kinetic Aspect: Does oxygen react faster or slower in acidic solutions?**\n    Kinetics deals with the rate of a reaction. While thermodynamically favorable (high E°), the reduction of oxygen is known to be a kinetically slow process. This is because the O=O double bond is very strong (bond dissociation energy ≈ 498 kJ/mol) and must be broken for the reaction to proceed. This high activation energy makes the reaction slow under standard conditions without a catalyst.\n\n    The question asks about the reaction rate in acidic solutions. Although the reaction is generally slow, it is kinetically **slower** in acidic media compared to other conditions or in the presence of catalysts. The multi-electron transfer process (4 electrons) involves several intermediate steps, some of which have high activation barriers. For instance, the first step, the one-electron reduction to form the superoxide radical (O₂⁻), is thermodynamically unfavorable. The overall reaction proceeds, but slowly. Therefore, kinetically, oxygen reacts **slower** in acidic solutions.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions (E° = +0.40 V) than in acidic solutions (E° = +1.23 V).\n*   Kinetically, the reduction of oxygen is generally **slower**, particularly in acidic solutions without a catalyst, due to the high activation energy required to break the O=O bond.\n\nTherefore, the correct combination is **weaker** and **slower**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThe user's first question asked: \"Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions. Which combination of weaker/stronger and faster/slower is correct?\"\nThe user's second input provided information that helps to solve the first part of the question.\n\n**Reasoning Process:**\n\n1.  **Thermodynamic Aspect (First Blank): Is oxygen a weaker or stronger oxidant in basic solutions?**\n    *   An oxidant's strength is measured by its standard reduction potential (E°). A higher (more positive) E° means a stronger oxidant.\n    *   From the provided information (and standard tables):\n        *   In acidic solution: O₂(g) + 4H⁺(aq) + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O(l) with E° = +1.23 V\n        *   In basic solution: O₂(g) + 2H₂O(l) + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻(aq) with E° = +0.40 V\n    *   Comparing the two potentials, +0.40 V (basic) is less than +1.23 V (acidic).\n    *   Therefore, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions compared to acidic solutions. This eliminates options C and D.\n\n2.  **Kinetic Aspect (Second Blank): Does oxygen react slower or faster in acidic solutions?**\n    *   Kinetics refers to the speed of the reaction, which is determined by its activation energy.\n    *   The reduction of oxygen is a complex, multi-step process that involves breaking a strong O=O double bond. This gives it a high activation energy, making it a notoriously slow, or \"sluggish,\" reaction in general.\n    *   Despite having a stronger thermodynamic driving force (higher E°) in acidic solutions, the kinetic barriers (activation energy) for oxygen reduction are generally *higher* in acidic media compared to alkaline (basic) media, especially on non-noble metal catalysts.\n    *   This higher kinetic barrier means the reaction is **slower** in acidic solutions.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The first blank should be \"weaker\".\n    *   The second blank should be \"slower\".\n    *   The correct combination is \"weaker - slower\". This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThermodynamically, oxygen's strength as an oxidant is determined by its standard reduction potential (E°). A higher E° value means a stronger oxidant.\nFrom the provided information:\n- In acidic solution: O₂(g) + 4H⁺(aq) + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O(l) has E° = +1.23 V\n- In basic solution: O₂(g) + 2H₂O(l) + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻(aq) has E° = +0.40 V\n\nComparing the two potentials, +0.40 V is less than +1.23 V. This means oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions compared to acidic solutions. This eliminates options B and C.\n\nKinetically, the reduction of oxygen is a notoriously slow reaction in electrochemistry. This is because the reaction involves the cleavage of a strong O=O double bond, which results in a high activation energy barrier. This slowness is a significant challenge in the development of fuel cells. The reaction is kinetically hindered and requires a significant overpotential (extra voltage beyond the thermodynamic potential) to proceed at a reasonable rate. Therefore, the reaction is considered **slower**, particularly when compared to its strong thermodynamic driving force in acidic solution.\n\nCombining the two findings:\n- Thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions.\n- Kinetically, oxygen reacts **slower** in acidic solutions.\n\nThis corresponds to the combination \"weaker - slower\".\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
