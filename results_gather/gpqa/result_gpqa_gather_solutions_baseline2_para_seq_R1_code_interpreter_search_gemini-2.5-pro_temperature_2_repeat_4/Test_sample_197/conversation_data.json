Perform the Calculation**\n\nWe are given:\n*   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M (Since the total cobalt concentration of 0.01 M is much smaller than the thiocyanate concentration, we can assume the free `[SCN⁻]` is approximately 0.1 M).\n*   `β₁ = 9`\n*   `β₂ = 40`\n*   `β₃ = 63`\n*   `β₄ = 16`\n\nFirst, let's calculate the denominator of the `α₂` fraction:\n*   Denominator = `1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.1²) + (63 * 0.1³) + (16 * 0.1⁴)`\n*   Denominator = `1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.01) + (63 * 0.001) + (16 * 0.0001)`\n*   Denominator = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016`\n*   Denominator = `2.3646`\n\nNext, calculate the numerator:\n*   Numerator = `β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n\nNow, calculate `α₂`:\n*   `α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\nTo express this as a percentage, multiply by 100:\n*   Percentage = `0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%`\n\nThis result matches the one calculated by the Python script.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThe problem asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, among all cobalt-containing species.

Since [SCN⁻] (0.1 M) is 10 times greater than c(Co) (0.01 M), this is a reasonable assumption.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the denominator of the fraction formula:\nDenominator = 1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴\nDenominator = 1 + (9 × 0.1) + (40 × 0.1²) + (63 × 0.1³) + (16 × 0.1⁴)\nDenominator = 1 + (9 × 0.1) + (40 × 0.01) + (63 × 0.001) + (16 × 0.0001)\nDenominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016\nDenominator = 2.3646\n\nNext, let's calculate the numerator for the α₂ fraction:\nNumerator = β₂[SCN⁻]²\nNumerator = 40 × (0.1)²\nNumerator = 40 × 0.01\nNumerator = 0.4\n\nNow, we can calculate the fraction (α₂) of the [Co(SCN)₂] complex:\nα₂ = Numerator / Denominator\nα₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\nPercentage = 0.16916 × 100% ≈ 16.9%\n\nThis matches the result from the code execution, which yielded 16.916%.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe problem asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, among all cobalt-containing species in a solution.\n\n**1.

    "This is a problem in coordination chemistry, specifically regarding the distribution of species in a complexation equilibrium. The goal is to calculate the percentage of one specific complex, dithiocyanato cobalt(II) `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total amount of cobalt in the solution.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the system and species:** The solution contains a central metal ion (Co²⁺) and a ligand (SCN⁻). They form a series of complexes: `[Co(SCN)]⁺`, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`, and `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`. The total concentration of all cobalt-containing species `c(Co)` is the sum of the free ion `[Co²⁺]` and all these complexes.\n\n2.  **Use the mole fraction formula:** The percentage of a specific complex is found by calculating its mole fraction (denoted as α_n for the n-th complex) and multiplying by 100. The mole fraction `α₂` for the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex is given by the formula:\n\n    α₂ = `[[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)`\n\n3.  **Express in terms of stability constants (β):** Using the definitions of overall stability constants, the formula for the mole fraction can be derived in a way that depends only on the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]` and the stability constants `β_n`. The `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, which means the total cobalt concentration `c(Co)` is not needed for this calculation. The formula is:\n\n    α₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n4.  **Substitute the given values:**\n    *   Ligand concentration [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M.

Since [SCN⁻] (0.1 M) is 10 times greater than c(Co) (0.01 M), this is a reasonable assumption.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the denominator of the fraction formula:\nDenominator = 1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴\nDenominator = 1 + (9 × 0.1) + (40 × 0.1²) + (63 × 0.1³) + (16 × 0.1⁴)\nDenominator = 1 + (9 × 0.1) + (40 × 0.01) + (63 × 0.001) + (16 × 0.0001)\nDenominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016\nDenominator = 2.3646\n\nNext, let's calculate the numerator for the α₂ fraction:\nNumerator = β₂[SCN⁻]²\nNumerator = 40 × (0.1)²\nNumerator = 40 × 0.01\nNumerator = 0.4\n\nNow, we can calculate the fraction (α₂) of the [Co(SCN)₂] complex:\nα₂ = Numerator / Denominator\nα₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\nPercentage = 0.16916 × 100% ≈ 16.9%\n\nThis matches the result from the code execution, which yielded 16.916%.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe problem asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, among all cobalt-containing species in a solution.\n\n**1.

The assumption that `[SCN⁻]` is constant at 0.1 M is valid because it is in ten-fold excess compared to the total cobalt concentration.\n\nThe code output `16.916180326482287` confirms this calculation.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nTo find the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, we first need to determine its mole fraction (`α₂`) relative to all other cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the free `Co^2+` ion and all its thiocyanato complexes:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)+] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3-] + [Co(SCN)4^2-]`\n\nThe concentration of each complex can be expressed using the overall stability constants (`βn`) and the concentrations of the free ions (`[Co^2+]` and `[SCN-]`):\n*   `[Co(SCN)+] = β₁ * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]`\n*   `[Co(SCN)2] = β₂ * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]²`\n*   `[Co(SCN)3-] = β₃ * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]³`\n*   `[Co(SCN)4^2-] = β₄ * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]⁴`\n\nThe mole fraction of the `[Co(SCN)2]` complex (`α₂`) is given by:\n`α₂ = [Co(SCN)2] / c(Co)`\n\nBy substituting the expressions for each species, we can derive a formula for `α₂` that depends only on the free ligand concentration `[SCN-]`:\n`α₂ = (β₂ * [SCN-]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN-] + β₂[SCN-]² + β₃[SCN-]³ + β₄[SCN-]⁴)`\n\nThe problem states that the total cobalt concentration is `0.01 M` and the thiocyanate concentration is `0.1 M`. Since the thiocyanate is in a 10-fold excess, the amount of thiocyanate that binds to cobalt will be small compared to its total concentration. Therefore, we can approximate the free thiocyanate concentration `[SCN-]` as its initial total concentration, `0.1 M`.\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n*   `[SCN-] = 0.1 M`\n*   `β₁ = 9`\n*   `β₂ = 40`\n*   `β₃ = 63`\n*   `β₄ = 16`\n\nLet's calculate the terms in the denominator:\n*   `1`\n*   `β₁[SCN-] = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9`\n*   `β₂[SCN-]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n*   `β₃[SCN-]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063`\n*   `β₄[SCN-]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016`\n\nThe denominator is the sum of these terms:\nDenominator = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\nThe numerator is the term corresponding to the `[Co(SCN)2]` complex:\nNumerator = `β₂[SCN-]² = 0.4`\n\nNow, calculate the mole fraction `α₂`:\n`α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\nTo get the percentage, we multiply the mole fraction by 100:\nPercentage = `0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%`\n\nThe python code executed in the previous step confirms this calculation, giving a result of 16.916%.

Understand the Chemical System**\nIn the solution, cobalt(II) ions, Co²⁺, react with thiocyanate ions, SCN⁻, to form a series of complexes. The equilibrium concentration of each complex can be related to the free cobalt ion concentration, [Co²⁺], and the free thiocyanate concentration, [SCN⁻], through the overall stability constants (β).\n\nThe cobalt-containing species are:\n*   Free Co²⁺\n*   [Co(SCN)]⁺\n*   [Co(SCN)₂] (dithiocyanato cobalt(II))\n*   [Co(SCN)₃]⁻\n*   [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\n**2. Formulate the Calculation for Mole Fraction (α)**\nThe percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], is its mole fraction (α₂) multiplied by 100.\n`Percentage = α₂ * 100 = ( [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co) ) * 100`\n\nWe can express the concentration of each complex using the stability constants:\n*   `[[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n\nSubstituting these into the equation for c(Co):\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n\nBy factoring out [Co²⁺], we get:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\nNow, let's write the expression for α₂:\n`α₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ( [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴) )`\n\nThe free cobalt concentration, [Co²⁺], cancels out, simplifying the equation. The species distribution depends only on the free ligand concentration, [SCN⁻].\n\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**3.
