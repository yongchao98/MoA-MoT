This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction. A mixture of concentrated nitric acid (HNO3) and concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4) generates the nitronium ion (NO2+), which is the electrophile.\n*   **Product 1:** Nitrobenzene. The nitro group (-NO2) is attached to the benzene ring.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is treated with Br2 and iron powder, forming product 2.**\n*   **Reactant:** Nitrobenzene (Product 1).\n*   **Reaction:** Bromination of nitrobenzene. This is another electrophilic aromatic substitution. Iron powder acts as a Lewis acid catalyst, reacting with Br2 to form FeBr3, which polarizes the Br-Br bond to generate the electrophile \"Br+\".\n*   **Directing Effect:** The nitro group (-NO2) is a strong deactivating and **meta-directing** group. Therefore, the incoming bromine atom will add to the position meta (position 3) to the nitro group.\n*   **Product 2:** m-Bromonitrobenzene (or 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene).\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is stirred with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 3.**\n*   **Reactant:** m-Bromonitrobenzene (Product 2).\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation. This reaction reduces the nitro group (-NO2) to an amino group (-NH2). The C-Br bond remains intact under these standard conditions.\n*   **Product 3:** m-Bromoaniline (or 3-bromoaniline).\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 is treated with NaNO2 and HBF4, forming product 4.**\n*   **Reactant:** m-Bromoaniline (Product 3).\n*   **Reaction:** Diazotization. The primary aromatic amine is converted into a diazonium salt. Sodium nitrite (NaNO2) and a strong acid (HBF4, fluoroboric acid) at low temperature (0-5 °C) form the diazonium cation. The counterion is the tetrafluoroborate (BF4-) from the acid.\n*   **Product 4:** m-Bromobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate ([3-Br-C6H4-N2]+[BF4]-).\n\n**Step 5: Product 4 is heated and then treated with anisole, forming final product 5.**\n*   **Reactants:** m-Bromobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate (Product 4) and anisole (methoxybenzene).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Gomberg-Bachmann reaction. When the diazonium salt is heated in the presence of another aromatic compound (anisole), it decomposes to form an aryl radical. This radical then attacks the other aromatic ring to form a biphenyl derivative.\n    *   **Radical formation:** The m-bromobenzenediazonium ion decomposes to form the m-bromophenyl radical (•C6H4Br) and nitrogen gas (N2).\n    *   **Radical attack:** The m-bromophenyl radical attacks the anisole ring. The methoxy group (-OCH3) on anisole is an activating, **ortho-, para-directing** group. Due to steric hindrance, the attack at the para position is favored over the ortho position.\n    *   **Coupling:** A new C-C bond forms between C1 of the m-bromophenyl radical and C4 (the para position) of the anisole ring.\n*   **Product 5:** The final product is a biphenyl molecule where one ring has a bromine atom at position 3, and the other ring has a methoxy group at position 4'. The IUPAC name is **3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl**.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 3'-bromo-2-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl - Incorrect (ortho attack and reversed numbering).\nB) 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl - Correct.\nC) 3-bromo-4'-fluoro-1,1'-biphenyl - Incorrect. This would be a product of the Schiemann reaction, which is a different pathway.\nD) 4-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl - Incorrect. This would require the initial bromination to be para, but the nitro group is a meta-director.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\n*   **Step 1: Nitration of Benzene**\n    *   **Reactants:** Benzene, HNO3 (nitric acid), and H2SO4 (sulfuric acid).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Nitration).\n    *   **Process:** Sulfuric acid acts as a catalyst by protonating nitric acid, which then loses a water molecule to form the highly electrophilic nitronium ion (NO2+). This ion attacks the benzene ring.\n    *   **Product 1:** Nitrobenzene. A nitro group (-NO2) is substituted onto the benzene ring.\n\n*   **Step 2: Bromination of Nitrobenzene**\n    *   **Reactants:** Product 1 (Nitrobenzene), Br2 (bromine), and iron powder (which reacts with Br2 to form the FeBr3 Lewis acid catalyst).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination).\n    *   **Process:** The nitro group (-NO2) is a strong electron-withdrawing group. This has two effects: it deactivates the ring, making it less reactive than benzene, and it directs incoming electrophiles to the *meta* position. Therefore, the bromine atom will add to the carbon at position 3 relative to the nitro group.\n    *   **Product 2:** m-Bromonitrobenzene (or 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene).\n\n*   **Step 3: Reduction of the Nitro Group**\n    *   **Reactants:** Product 2 (m-Bromonitrobenzene), H2 (hydrogen gas), and Pd/C (palladium on carbon).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** Catalytic Hydrogenation.\n    *   **Process:** This set of reagents is a standard method for reducing a nitro group (-NO2) to a primary amine group (-NH2). The carbon-bromine bond is generally stable under these conditions.\n    *   **Product 3:** m-Bromoaniline (or 3-bromoaniline).\n\n*   **Step 4: Diazotization of the Amine**\n    *   **Reactants:** Product 3 (m-Bromoaniline), NaNO2 (sodium nitrite), and HBF4 (fluoroboric acid).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** Diazotization.\n    *   **Process:** The primary aromatic amine reacts with nitrous acid (formed in situ from NaNO2 and acid) to form a diazonium salt. In this case, the product is an arenediazonium tetrafluoroborate, which is relatively stable.\n    *   **Product 4:** 3-Bromobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate.\n\n*   **Step 5: Gomberg-Bachmann Reaction**\n    *   **Reactants:** Product 4 (3-Bromobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate) and anisole (methoxybenzene), with heating.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** Gomberg-Bachmann Reaction (Aryl-Aryl Coupling).\n    *   **Process:** Heating the diazonium salt causes it to decompose, releasing N2 gas and forming a 3-bromophenyl radical. This highly reactive radical then attacks the anisole molecule. The methoxy group (-OCH3) on anisole is an electron-donating group, making the ring activated towards this attack and directing the substitution to the *ortho* and *para* positions. Due to steric hindrance, the *para* product is predominantly formed.\n    *   **Final Product (Product 5):** The 3-bromophenyl group attaches to the para position of anisole. This creates a biphenyl structure where one ring has a bromine at position 3, and the other ring has a methoxy group at position 4' (para to the new C-C bond). The correct IUPAC name for this molecule is **3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl**.\n\n*   **Matching with Options:**\n    *   A) 3'-bromo-2-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl: Incorrect. The methoxy group directs para, not ortho.\n    *   B) 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl: Correct. This matches our derived product.\n    *   C) 4-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl: Incorrect. The bromination in step 2 was meta-directing, not para-directing.\n    *   D) 3-bromo-4'-fluoro-1,1'-biphenyl: Incorrect. The reagent used was anisole (methoxybenzene), not a fluorine source.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the multi-step synthesis reaction:\n\n**Step 1: Benzene is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4, forming product 1.**\n*   **Reaction:** Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Nitration).\n*   **Reagents:** A mixture of concentrated nitric acid (HNO3) and concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4) is known as \"mixed acid\". H2SO4 protonates HNO3, which then loses water to form the highly electrophilic nitronium ion (NO2+).\n*   **Mechanism:** The nitronium ion attacks the benzene ring, and after loss of a proton, nitrobenzene is formed.\n*   **Product 1:** Nitrobenzene (C6H5NO2).\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is treated with Br2 and iron powder, forming product 2.**\n*   **Reaction:** Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination).\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1 is nitrobenzene.\n*   **Reagents:** Bromine (Br2) and iron powder (Fe). The iron acts as a Lewis acid catalyst, reacting with Br2 to form FeBr3, which polarizes the Br2 molecule to create a strong electrophile (Br+).\n*   **Directing Effect:** The nitro group (-NO2) is a powerful electron-withdrawing group. It strongly deactivates the aromatic ring towards electrophilic substitution and directs incoming electrophiles to the **meta** position.\n*   **Product 2:** The bromine atom will add to the position meta to the nitro group. This results in **1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene** (or m-bromonitrobenzene).\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is stirred with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 3.**\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic Hydrogenation (Reduction).\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2 is 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Reagents:** Hydrogen gas (H2) and Palladium on Carbon (Pd/C). This is a standard method for reducing a nitro group (-NO2) to a primary amine group (-NH2). The aryl-halide bond (C-Br) is typically unaffected by these conditions.\n*   **Product 3:** The nitro group is reduced to an amine, yielding **3-bromoaniline** (or m-bromoaniline).\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 is treated with NaNO2 and HBF4, forming product 4.**\n*   **Reaction:** Diazotization.\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3 is 3-bromoaniline, a primary aromatic amine.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium nitrite (NaNO2) and fluoroboric acid (HBF4). The acid reacts with NaNO2 to form nitrous acid (HONO) in situ. The amine reacts with nitrous acid at low temperatures (0-5 °C) to form a diazonium salt. The use of HBF4 specifically forms the tetrafluoroborate salt.\n*   **Product 4:** **3-bromobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate** ([3-Br-C6H4-N2]+[BF4]−). This salt is a precursor for various reactions.\n\n**Step 5: Product 4 is heated and then treated with anisole, forming final product 5.**\n*   **Reaction:** Gomberg-Bachmann Reaction (Aryl-Aryl Radical Coupling).\n*   **Reactants:** Product 4 (3-bromobenzenediazonium salt) and anisole (methoxybenzene).\n*   **Mechanism:** Heating the diazonium salt causes it to decompose, releasing nitrogen gas and forming a highly reactive aryl radical: the **3-bromophenyl radical** (•C6H4Br). This radical then attacks the anisole molecule.\n*   **Directing Effect:** Anisole has a methoxy group (-OCH3), which is a strong electron-donating group. It activates the ring and is an **ortho, para-director**. The incoming 3-bromophenyl radical will preferentially add to the ortho or para positions. Due to steric hindrance, the attack at the **para** position is favored and leads to the major product.\n*   **Final Product 5:** The 3-bromophenyl group attaches to the para position (C4) of the anisole ring. The resulting molecule is **3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl**.\n\nLet's match this final product with the given options:\n*   **A) 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl:** This matches our derived major product.\n*   B) 4-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl: This is incorrect because the initial bromination was meta, not para.\n*   C) 3'-bromo-2-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl: This would be the minor product from ortho-attack on anisole.\n*   D) 3-bromo-4'-fluoro-1,1'-biphenyl: This is incorrect as anisole does not contain fluorine.\n\nThe major product of the reaction sequence is 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the synthesis reaction:\n\n**Step 1: Benzene is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4, forming product 1.**\n*   **Reaction:** Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Nitration).\n*   **Reagents:** A mixture of concentrated nitric acid (HNO3) and concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4) generates the nitronium ion (NO2+), which is a powerful electrophile.\n*   **Mechanism:** The nitronium ion attacks the benzene ring, replacing a hydrogen atom.\n*   **Product 1:** Nitrobenzene.\n\n     \n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is treated with Br2 and iron powder, forming product 2.**\n*   **Reactant:** Nitrobenzene.\n*   **Reaction:** Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination).\n*   **Reagents:** Bromine (Br2) and a Lewis acid catalyst, FeBr3, which is formed in situ from iron powder (Fe) and Br2.\n*   **Directing Effect:** The nitro group (-NO2) is a strongly deactivating and **meta-directing** group.

This radical then attacks the anisole molecule in an electrophilic-like radical substitution.\n*   **Directing Effect:** The methoxy group (-OCH3) on anisole is an activating and **ortho, para-directing** group. The attack by the bulky m-bromophenyl radical will occur preferentially at the less sterically hindered **para** position.\n*   **Final Product (Product 5):** The m-bromophenyl group attaches to the para-position of the anisole ring. The resulting structure is a biphenyl system with a bromine atom at position 3 of one ring and a methoxy group at position 4' of the other ring.\n*   **Name:** 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl.\n\n     \n\nComparing this final product name with the given options:\nA) 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl - This matches our derived product.\nB) 3'-bromo-2-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl - This would result from ortho-attack on anisole, which is the minor product.\nC) 4-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl - This would require the starting aniline to be p-bromoaniline, which is incorrect as the nitration is meta-directing.\nD) 3-bromo-4'-fluoro-1,1'-biphenyl - This name is inconsistent with the reagents used (anisole). It suggests a different reaction pathway, like the Schiemann reaction followed by a coupling, which is not what is described.\n\nTherefore, the correct final product is 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the synthesis reaction to identify the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Benzene is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4, forming product 1.**\n*   **Reaction:** Nitration of Benzene.\n*   **Reagents:** A mixture of concentrated nitric acid (HNO3) and concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4) is known as \"mixed acid\".

Due to steric hindrance, the attack at the **para position** (position 4) is strongly favored over the attack at the ortho position (position 2).\n*   **Product 5:** The new carbon-carbon bond forms between the carbon that held the diazonium group (C1 of the bromo-ring) and the carbon para to the methoxy group (C4' of the anisole ring).\n    *   The resulting molecule has a bromine atom at position 3 of the first ring.\n    *   It has a methoxy group at position 4' of the second ring.\n*   **Final Product Name:** **3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl**.\n\nComparing this name to the given options:\nA) 3-bromo-4'-fluoro-1,1'-biphenyl\nB) 4-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl\nC) 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl\nD) 3'-bromo-2-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl\n\nThe derived product matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning for the multi-step synthesis:\n\n**Step 1: Benzene is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4, forming product 1.**\n*   **Reaction Type:** Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Nitration).\n*   **Reagents:** Benzene, nitric acid (HNO3), sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Mechanism:** Sulfuric acid acts as a catalyst by protonating nitric acid, which then loses a molecule of water to form the nitronium ion (NO2+), a strong electrophile. The benzene ring attacks the nitronium ion.\n*   **Product 1:** Nitrobenzene. A nitro group (-NO2) is substituted onto the benzene ring.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is treated with Br2 and iron powder, forming product 2.**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1 is nitrobenzene.\n*   **Reaction Type:** Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination).\n*   **Reagents:** Bromine (Br2) and iron powder (Fe). The iron acts as a catalyst by reacting with Br2 to form the Lewis acid FeBr3 in situ, which polarizes the Br-Br bond to generate the electrophile 'Br+'.\n*   **Directing Effect:** The nitro group (-NO2) is a strong electron-withdrawing group, which deactivates the ring towards electrophilic substitution. It is a **meta-director**.\n*   **Product 2:** m-Bromonitrobenzene (or 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene). The incoming bromine atom is directed to the position meta (at C-3) relative to the nitro group.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is stirred with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 3.**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2 is m-bromonitrobenzene.\n*   **Reaction Type:** Catalytic Hydrogenation (Reduction).\n*   **Reagents:** Hydrogen gas (H2) and a palladium on carbon catalyst (Pd/C).\n*   **Mechanism:** This set of reagents is a standard method for the reduction of a nitro group (-NO2) to a primary amine group (-NH2). The aryl-halide bond (C-Br) is typically stable under these conditions.\n*   **Product 3:** m-Bromoaniline (or 3-bromoaniline). The -NO2 group is reduced to an -NH2 group.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 is treated with NaNO2 and HBF4, forming product 4.**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3 is m-bromoaniline.\n*   **Reaction Type:** Diazotization.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium nitrite (NaNO2) and fluoroboric acid (HBF4).\n*   **Mechanism:** The primary aromatic amine reacts with nitrous acid (formed in situ from NaNO2 and H+) to form an aryldiazonium salt.

This radical then attacks another aromatic ring, in this case, anisole. Anisole has a strong electron-donating methoxy group (-OCH3), which is an **ortho, para-director**. Due to steric hindrance, the attack by the bulky aryl radical is much more likely to occur at the less hindered **para-position**. This forms a new carbon-carbon bond between the two aromatic rings, resulting in a biphenyl derivative.\n*   **Product 5:**\n    *   One ring comes from Product 4 and is a **3-bromophenyl** group.\n    *   The second ring comes from anisole and is attached at its para-position (C-4'), making it a **4-methoxyphenyl** group.\n    *   Combining these gives **3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl**.\n\nLet's compare this final product with the given options:\nA) 4-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl - Incorrect.

FeBr3 polarizes the Br-Br bond, generating the electrophile \"Br+\".\n*   **Reaction:** Electrophilic aromatic bromination.\n*   **Directing Effect:** The nitro group (-NO2) is a strong electron-withdrawing group. It deactivates the aromatic ring towards electrophilic attack and directs incoming substituents to the **meta** position.\n*   **Product 2:** The bromine atom attaches to the carbon at position 3 relative to the nitro group. The product is **1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene** (or m-bromonitrobenzene).\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is stirred with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 3.**\n*   **Reactant:** 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene (Product 2).\n*   **Reagents:** Hydrogen gas (H2) and Palladium on carbon (Pd/C).\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation. This is a standard method for the reduction of a nitro group (-NO2) to a primary amine group (-NH2). This reaction is generally selective and will not remove the bromine atom under typical conditions.\n*   **Product 3:** The nitro group is reduced to an amine. The product is **3-bromoaniline** (or m-bromoaniline).\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 is treated with NaNO2 and HBF4, forming product 4.**\n*   **Reactant:** 3-bromoaniline (Product 3).\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium nitrite (NaNO2) and fluoroboric acid (HBF4).\n*   **Reaction:** Diazotization. The primary aromatic amine reacts with nitrous acid (HONO, formed in situ from NaNO2 and acid) to form a diazonium salt. The fluoroborate anion (BF4-) acts as the counterion.\n*   **Product 4:** The product is **3-bromobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate**. ([m-Br-C6H4-N≡N]+ BF4-).\n\n**Step 5: Product 4 is heated and then treated with anisole, forming final product 5.**\n*   **Reactants:** 3-bromobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate (Product 4) and anisole (methoxybenzene, C6H5OCH3).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a **Gomberg-Bachmann reaction**. When heated, the diazonium salt decomposes to form a free radical (the **3-bromophenyl radical**) and nitrogen gas (N2).\n*   **Mechanism:** This aryl radical then attacks the other aromatic ring (anisole). The methoxy group (-OCH3) on anisole is an electron-donating group, making the anisole ring activated for substitution. It is an **ortho, para-director**. Due to steric hindrance, substitution at the **para** position is strongly favored over the ortho position.\n*   **Coupling:** The 3-bromophenyl radical attacks the para position of the anisole ring, forming a new carbon-carbon bond between the two rings. A hydrogen atom is then lost from the anisole ring to restore its aromaticity.\n*   **Final Product 5 Structure:**\n    *   One ring is a phenyl group with a bromine atom at position 3.\n    *   The second ring is a phenyl group with a methoxy group at position 4 (para).\n    *   These two rings are linked together to form a biphenyl structure.\n*   **Naming the Product:** The resulting molecule is named **3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl**.\n\nLet's compare this with the given options:\nA) 4-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl: Incorrect. The bromine is at position 3, not 4.\nB) 3'-bromo-2-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl: Incorrect. The methoxy group is at position 4' (para), not 2' (ortho).\nC) 3-bromo-4'-fluoro-1,1'-biphenyl: Incorrect. This would be the product of a Schiemann reaction (heating the diazonium salt without anisole) followed by another improbable step. Anisole is used as a reactant here, not a solvent, indicating it participates in the bond formation.\nD) 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl: **Correct**. This structure matches the outcome of the reaction sequence.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product of the reaction sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Nitration of Benzene**\n*   **Reaction:** Benzene is treated with a mixture of concentrated nitric acid (HNO₃) and concentrated sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Mechanism:** This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction. The sulfuric acid acts as a catalyst by protonating nitric acid, which then loses water to form the powerful electrophile, the nitronium ion (NO₂⁺).\n*   **Product 1:** The nitronium ion attacks the benzene ring, replacing one hydrogen atom. The product is **Nitrobenzene**.\n\n \n\n**Step 2: Bromination of Nitrobenzene**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (Nitrobenzene) is treated with bromine (Br₂) and a Lewis acid catalyst, typically iron powder (which reacts with Br₂ to form FeBr₃ in situ).\n*   **Mechanism:** This is another electrophilic aromatic substitution. The nitro group (-NO₂) is a strong electron-withdrawing group. This has two effects: it deactivates the benzene ring towards further electrophilic attack, and it directs incoming electrophiles to the **meta** position (position 3).\n*   **Product 2:** The electrophile (Br⁺) adds to the meta position relative to the nitro group. The product is **1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n \n\n**Step 3: Reduction of the Nitro Group**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene) is stirred with a Palladium on carbon catalyst (Pd/C) under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n*   **Mechanism:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. This reaction selectively reduces the nitro group (-NO₂) to a primary amine group (-NH₂) without affecting the carbon-bromine bond (hydrogenolysis of the C-Br bond is much slower under these conditions).\n*   **Product 3:** The product is **3-bromoaniline**.\n\n \n\n**Step 4: Diazotization**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (3-bromoaniline) is treated with sodium nitrite (NaNO₂) and tetrafluoroboric acid (HBF₄), typically at low temperatures (0-5 °C).\n*   **Mechanism:** This is a diazotization reaction. The primary aromatic amine reacts with nitrous acid (formed in situ from NaNO₂ and H⁺ from HBF₄) to form a diazonium salt. The use of HBF₄ yields the relatively stable diazonium tetrafluoroborate salt.\n*   **Product 4:** The product is **3-bromobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate**.\n\n \n\n**Step 5: Gomberg-Bachmann Reaction**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 4 (3-bromobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate) is heated and treated with anisole (methoxybenzene).\n*   **Mechanism:** This reaction is a type of aryl-aryl coupling known as the Gomberg-Bachmann reaction. Upon heating, the diazonium salt decomposes to form a **3-bromophenyl radical** (or cation, depending on specific conditions). This reactive intermediate then attacks the second aromatic ring, anisole.\n    *   The substituent on anisole is the methoxy group (-OCH₃). The methoxy group is a strong electron-donating, activating group that directs incoming substituents to the **ortho** and **para** positions.\n    *   Due to steric hindrance, the attack at the **para** position (position 4) is highly favored over the ortho position.\n*   **Final Product 5:** The 3-bromophenyl group attaches to the para position of the anisole ring. The resulting molecule is a substituted biphenyl. The final product is **3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl**.\n\n \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the final product is 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl.

This would be the product of ortho-attack on anisole, which is the minor product.\nD) 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl: This matches our derived structure for the major product.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the multi-step synthesis to identify the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Benzene is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4, forming product 1.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Nitration).\n*   **Reagents:** Nitrating mixture (concentrated HNO3 and H2SO4) generates the nitronium ion (NO2+), a strong electrophile.\n*   **Mechanism:** The nitronium ion attacks the benzene ring.\n*   **Product 1:** Nitrobenzene. A nitro group (-NO2) is added to the benzene ring.\n    \n     ![Step 1: Nitration of Benzene](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Nitration_of_benzene.svg/400px-Nitration_of_benzene.svg.png) \n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (Nitrobenzene) is treated with Br2 and iron powder, forming product 2.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination).\n*   **Reagents:** Bromine (Br2) and a Lewis acid catalyst (Fe powder, which forms FeBr3 *in situ*). This generates the electrophile Br+.\n*   **Directing Effect:** The nitro group (-NO2) on the benzene ring is a strong electron-withdrawing group and a **meta-director**. It deactivates the ring and directs the incoming electrophile (Br) to the position meta (carbon-3) to itself.\n*   **Product 2:** m-Bromonitrobenzene (1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene).\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (m-Bromonitrobenzene) is stirred with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 3.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic Hydrogenation (Reduction).\n*   **Reagents:** Hydrogen gas (H2) and a palladium on carbon catalyst (Pd/C).\n*   **Mechanism:** This reaction selectively reduces the nitro group (-NO2) to a primary amino group (-NH2) without affecting the C-Br bond.\n*   **Product 3:** m-Bromoaniline (3-bromoaniline).\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (m-Bromoaniline) is treated with NaNO2 and HBF4, forming product 4.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Diazotization.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium nitrite (NaNO2) and an acid (HBF4, tetrafluoroboric acid). These react to form nitrous acid (HONO) *in situ*.\n*   **Mechanism:** The primary aromatic amine (-NH2) reacts with nitrous acid to form an arenediazonium salt. The counterion is the tetrafluoroborate (BF4-).\n*   **Product 4:** 3-Bromobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate. This is a relatively stable diazonium salt.\n\n**Step 5: Product 4 is heated and then treated with anisole, forming final product 5.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Gomberg-Bachmann Reaction.\n*   **Mechanism:** This reaction is used to form biaryl compounds. Upon heating, the diazonium salt (Product 4) decomposes to form the **3-bromophenyl radical**. This highly reactive radical then attacks the other aromatic compound, which is anisole (methoxybenzene).\n*   **Attack on Anisole:** Anisole has a methoxy group (-OCH3), which is a strong activating group and is **ortho, para-directing**. The incoming 3-bromophenyl radical will preferentially attack the positions of high electron density. Due to steric hindrance at the ortho positions, the main product will result from the attack at the **para-position**.\n*   **Structure of Final Product 5:** A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the C1 of the 3-bromophenyl radical and the C4 (para position) of the anisole ring. The resulting molecule is a biphenyl derivative. One ring has a bromine atom at position 3, and the other ring (from anisole) has a methoxy group at position 4'.\n*   **Name of Final Product 5:** 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\n\nA) **3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl** - This matches our derived product.\nB) 4-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl - Incorrect. The bromine is at the 3-position, not the 4-position.\nC) 3-bromo-4'-fluoro-1,1'-biphenyl - Incorrect. This would imply the diazonium salt was replaced by fluorine (Schiemann reaction) and then coupled, which is inconsistent with the reagents.\nD) 3'-bromo-2-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl - Incorrect. This would result from an attack at the ortho position of anisole, which is sterically hindered and thus a minor product.\n\nThe correct final product is 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning for the synthesis:\n\n**Step 1: Benzene is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4, forming product 1.**\n*   **Reaction Type:** Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Nitration).\n*   **Reagents:** A mixture of concentrated nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4) generates the electrophile, the nitronium ion (NO2+).\n*   **Mechanism:** The nitronium ion attacks the benzene ring, replacing one hydrogen atom.\n*   **Product 1:** Nitrobenzene.\n    *   Structure: A benzene ring with a nitro group (-NO2) attached.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (Nitrobenzene) is treated with Br2 and iron powder, forming product 2.**\n*   **Reaction Type:** Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination).\n*   **Reagents:** Bromine (Br2) and a Lewis acid catalyst, typically FeBr3, which is formed in situ from iron powder and bromine. This generates the electrophile Br+.\n*   **Directing Effect:** The nitro group (-NO2) already on the ring is a strong deactivating group and a *meta*-director. This is because it withdraws electron density from the ring, making the *ortho* and *para* positions especially electron-poor. Therefore, the incoming electrophile (Br+) will add to the *meta* position.\n*   **Product 2:** 1-Bromo-3-nitrobenzene (or *m*-bromonitrobenzene).\n    *   Structure: A benzene ring with a nitro group and a bromine atom at the meta position (positions 1 and 3) relative to each other.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (1-Bromo-3-nitrobenzene) is stirred with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 3.**\n*   **Reaction Type:** Catalytic Hydrogenation (Reduction).\n*   **Reagents:** Hydrogen gas (H2) and a palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst.\n*   **Mechanism:** This is a standard method for the reduction of a nitro group to an amino group. The C-Br bond is not affected under these conditions.\n*   **Product 3:** 3-Bromoaniline (or *m*-bromoaniline).\n    *   Structure: The nitro group (-NO2) of product 2 is converted to an amino group (-NH2). The product has an amino group and a bromine atom at positions 1 and 3.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (3-Bromoaniline) is treated with NaNO2 and HBF4, forming product 4.**\n*   **Reaction Type:** Diazotization.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium nitrite (NaNO2) and a strong acid, in this case, fluoroboric acid (HBF4). These react to form nitrous acid (HONO) in situ.\n*   **Mechanism:** The primary aromatic amine (-NH2) reacts with nitrous acid (at 0-5 °C) to form a stable aryldiazonium salt. The counter-ion is the tetrafluoroborate anion (BF4-) from the acid used.\n*   **Product 4:** 3-Bromobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate.\n    *   Structure: The amino group (-NH2) is replaced by a diazonium group (-N2+ BF4-). The structure is a benzene ring with a diazonium group at position 1 and a bromine atom at position 3.\n\n**Step 5: Product 4 is heated and then treated with anisole, forming final product 5.**\n*   **Reaction Type:** Gomberg-Bachmann Reaction (or a related diazonium coupling).\n*   **Reactants:** Product 4 (3-bromobenzenediazonium salt) and anisole (methoxybenzene).\n*   **Mechanism:** The diazonium salt acts as an electrophile (or generates an aryl radical upon heating) that attacks the electron-rich anisole ring. Anisole has a methoxy group (-OCH3), which is a strong activating group and is *ortho, para*-directing. The attack will occur preferentially at the *para* position due to lower steric hindrance compared to the *ortho* positions. A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the two rings, and nitrogen gas (N2) is eliminated.\n*   **Product 5:** The final product is a biphenyl derivative.\n    *   One ring comes from product 4 and has a bromine atom at position 3.\n    *   The other ring comes from anisole and has a methoxy group. The new bond is formed at the *para* position (position 4) relative to this methoxy group.\n    *   According to IUPAC nomenclature, the structure is named **3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl**.\n\nLet's compare this result to the given options:\nA) 3-bromo-4'-fluoro-1,1'-biphenyl - Incorrect. No source of fluorine in the final step.\nB) 4-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl - Incorrect. The bromine atom is at position 3, not 4.\nC) 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl - Correct. This matches our derived structure.\nD) 3'-bromo-2-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl - Incorrect. The methoxy group would be at position 4' (para), not 2' (ortho).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product of the reaction sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Benzene is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4, forming product 1.**\n*   **Reaction:** This is the electrophilic nitration of benzene. The mixture of concentrated nitric acid (HNO3) and concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4) generates the nitronium ion (NO2+), which is a powerful electrophile.\n*   **Mechanism:** The nitronium ion attacks the benzene ring in an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction.\n*   **Product 1:** Nitrobenzene.\n     ![Step 1: Nitration of Benzene](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Nitration_of_benzene.svg/400px-Nitration_of_benzene.svg.png) \n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (Nitrobenzene) is treated with Br2 and iron powder, forming product 2.**\n*   **Reaction:** This is the electrophilic bromination of nitrobenzene. Iron powder reacts with bromine (Br2) to form iron(III) bromide (FeBr3), a Lewis acid catalyst that polarizes the Br-Br bond to generate the electrophile 'Br+'.\n*   **Directing Effect:** The nitro group (-NO2) on the benzene ring is a strong electron-withdrawing group. Such groups are \"deactivating\" (make the ring less reactive toward electrophilic substitution) and are **meta-directors**. They direct incoming electrophiles to the meta position (position 3).\n*   **Product 2:** 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene (or m-bromonitrobenzene).\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene) is stirred with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 3.**\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) is a common catalyst for this reaction.\n*   **Transformation:** This process selectively reduces the nitro group (-NO2) to an amino group (-NH2) without affecting the C-Br bond.\n*   **Product 3:** 3-bromoaniline (or m-bromoaniline).\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (3-bromoaniline) is treated with NaNO2 and HBF4, forming product 4.**\n*   **Reaction:** This is a diazotization reaction. The primary aromatic amine (3-bromoaniline) reacts with nitrous acid (HONO), which is generated in situ from sodium nitrite (NaNO2) and a strong acid (in this case, HBF4).\n*   **Product:** The reaction forms an aromatic diazonium salt. The cation is 3-bromobenzenediazonium ([m-Br-C6H4-N2]+), and the anion is tetrafluoroborate ([BF4]-).\n*   **Product 4:** 3-bromobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate. This salt is relatively stable compared to diazonium chlorides or sulfates.\n\n**Step 5: Product 4 (3-bromobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate) is heated and then treated with anisole, forming final product 5.**\n*   **Reaction:** This is a **Gomberg-Bachmann reaction**. When the diazonium salt is heated in an aromatic solvent (here, anisole), it decomposes to form an aryl radical and nitrogen gas.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The 3-bromobenzenediazonium ion loses N2 gas to form a **3-bromophenyl radical**.\n    2.  This highly reactive radical attacks the solvent molecule, anisole (methoxybenzene).\n*   **Directing Effect:** Anisole has a methoxy group (-OCH3), which is an electron-donating group. It is \"activating\" and an **ortho-, para-director**. It directs the incoming radical to the ortho (position 2) and para (position 4) positions. Due to steric hindrance, substitution at the para position is generally favored and gives the major product.\n*   **Final Product Formation:** The 3-bromophenyl radical attacks the para position of the anisole ring. A C-C bond forms between C1 of the 3-bromophenyl radical and C4 of the anisole ring.\n*   **Product 5:** The resulting molecule is 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl. The 'prime' notation (') is used to distinguish the atoms of the two different rings. The bromine is at position 3 of one ring, and the methoxy group is at position 4 of the other ring.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on this analysis:\n*   A) 3'-bromo-2-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl: This would be the minor product resulting from ortho-attack on anisole.\n*   B) 3-bromo-4'-fluoro-1,1'-biphenyl: This product is incorrect. It implies a fluorine atom has been added, which is not consistent with the Gomberg-Bachmann reaction pathway.\n*   C) 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl: This matches the structure of the major product from the Gomberg-Bachmann reaction, resulting from the favored para-attack on the anisole ring.\n*   D) 4-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl: This is incorrect because the initial bromination occurs at the meta-position (position 3), not the para-position (position 4), due to the meta-directing nitro group.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the reaction sequence is 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning for the multi-step synthesis:\n\n**Step 1: Benzene is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4, forming product 1.**\n*   **Reaction:** Nitration of benzene.

The iron powder acts as a catalyst by reacting with bromine to form iron(III) bromide (FeBr3), a Lewis acid. FeBr3 polarizes the Br-Br bond, generating the electrophile \"Br+\".\n*   **Reaction:** Electrophilic aromatic bromination.\n*   **Directing Effect:** The nitro group (-NO2) is a strong electron-withdrawing group. It deactivates the aromatic ring towards electrophilic attack and directs incoming substituents to the **meta** position.\n*   **Product 2:** The bromine atom attaches to the carbon at position 3 relative to the nitro group. The product is **1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene** (or m-bromonitrobenzene).\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is stirred with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 3.**\n*   **Reactant:** 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene (Product 2).\n*   **Reagents:** Hydrogen gas (H2) and Palladium on carbon (Pd/C).\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation. This is a standard method for the reduction of a nitro group (-NO2) to a primary amine group (-NH2). This reaction is generally selective and will not remove the bromine atom under typical conditions.\n*   **Product 3:** The nitro group is reduced to an amine. The product is **3-bromoaniline** (or m-bromoaniline).\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 is treated with NaNO2 and HBF4, forming product 4.**\n*   **Reactant:** 3-bromoaniline (Product 3).\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium nitrite (NaNO2) and fluoroboric acid (HBF4).\n*   **Reaction:** Diazotization.

When heated, the diazonium salt decomposes to form a free radical (the **3-bromophenyl radical**) and nitrogen gas (N2).\n*   **Mechanism:** This aryl radical then attacks the other aromatic ring (anisole). The methoxy group (-OCH3) on anisole is an electron-donating group, making the anisole ring activated for substitution. It is an **ortho, para-director**. Due to steric hindrance, substitution at the **para** position is strongly favored over the ortho position.\n*   **Coupling:** The 3-bromophenyl radical attacks the para position of the anisole ring, forming a new carbon-carbon bond between the two rings. A hydrogen atom is then lost from the anisole ring to restore its aromaticity.\n*   **Final Product 5 Structure:**\n    *   One ring is a phenyl group with a bromine atom at position 3.\n    *   The second ring is a phenyl group with a methoxy group at position 4 (para).\n    *   These two rings are linked together to form a biphenyl structure.\n*   **Naming the Product:** The resulting molecule is named **3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl**.\n\nLet's compare this with the given options:\nA) 4-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl: Incorrect.

This would be the product of a Schiemann reaction (heating the diazonium salt without anisole) followed by another improbable step. Anisole is used as a reactant here, not a solvent, indicating it participates in the bond formation.\nD) 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl: **Correct**. This structure matches the outcome of the reaction sequence.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product of the reaction sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Nitration of Benzene**\n*   **Reaction:** Benzene is treated with a mixture of concentrated nitric acid (HNO₃) and concentrated sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Mechanism:** This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction. The sulfuric acid acts as a catalyst by protonating nitric acid, which then loses water to form the powerful electrophile, the nitronium ion (NO₂⁺).\n*   **Product 1:** The nitronium ion attacks the benzene ring, replacing one hydrogen atom. The product is **Nitrobenzene**.\n\n \n\n**Step 2: Bromination of Nitrobenzene**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (Nitrobenzene) is treated with bromine (Br₂) and a Lewis acid catalyst, typically iron powder (which reacts with Br₂ to form FeBr₃ in situ).\n*   **Mechanism:** This is another electrophilic aromatic substitution. The nitro group (-NO₂) is a strong electron-withdrawing group. This has two effects: it deactivates the benzene ring towards further electrophilic attack, and it directs incoming electrophiles to the **meta** position (position 3).\n*   **Product 2:** The electrophile (Br⁺) adds to the meta position relative to the nitro group. The product is **1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n \n\n**Step 3: Reduction of the Nitro Group**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene) is stirred with a Palladium on carbon catalyst (Pd/C) under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n*   **Mechanism:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. This reaction selectively reduces the nitro group (-NO₂) to a primary amine group (-NH₂) without affecting the carbon-bromine bond (hydrogenolysis of the C-Br bond is much slower under these conditions).\n*   **Product 3:** The product is **3-bromoaniline**.\n\n \n\n**Step 4: Diazotization**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (3-bromoaniline) is treated with sodium nitrite (NaNO₂) and tetrafluoroboric acid (HBF₄), typically at low temperatures (0-5 °C).\n*   **Mechanism:** This is a diazotization reaction. The primary aromatic amine reacts with nitrous acid (formed in situ from NaNO₂ and H⁺ from HBF₄) to form a diazonium salt. The use of HBF₄ yields the relatively stable diazonium tetrafluoroborate salt.\n*   **Product 4:** The product is **3-bromobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate**.\n\n \n\n**Step 5: Gomberg-Bachmann Reaction**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 4 (3-bromobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate) is heated and treated with anisole (methoxybenzene).\n*   **Mechanism:** This reaction is a type of aryl-aryl coupling known as the Gomberg-Bachmann reaction. Upon heating, the diazonium salt decomposes to form a **3-bromophenyl radical** (or cation, depending on specific conditions). This reactive intermediate then attacks the second aromatic ring, anisole.\n    *   The substituent on anisole is the methoxy group (-OCH₃). The methoxy group is a strong electron-donating, activating group that directs incoming substituents to the **ortho** and **para** positions.\n    *   Due to steric hindrance, the attack at the **para** position (position 4) is highly favored over the ortho position.\n*   **Final Product 5:** The 3-bromophenyl group attaches to the para position of the anisole ring. The resulting molecule is a substituted biphenyl. The final product is **3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl**.\n\n \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the final product is 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl.
