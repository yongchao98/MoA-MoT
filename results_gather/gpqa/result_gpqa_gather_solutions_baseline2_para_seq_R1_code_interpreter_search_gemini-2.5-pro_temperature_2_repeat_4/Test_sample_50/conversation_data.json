Understanding the Problem\nWe need to find the total potential energy of a system composed of a point charge `q` and a grounded conducting sphere. A \"grounded\" sphere means its electric potential is maintained at zero (V=0). The charge `q` will induce charges on the surface of the sphere. The potential energy of the system is the work done to assemble this configuration, specifically, the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to a distance `d` from the sphere's center.\n\n### 2. Method of Images\nThis problem is a classic application of the \"method of images\". This powerful technique allows us to replace the complex problem of a charge and a conductor with a simpler problem involving only point charges that replicate the electric field in the region of interest (outside the sphere).\n\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the electric field and potential outside the sphere can be perfectly mimicked by:\n1.  The original charge `q` at distance `d`.\n2.  An \"image charge\" `q'` placed *inside* the sphere.\n\nThe magnitude and position of this image charge are chosen such that the potential on the surface of the sphere (at a distance R from the center) is zero. The standard results for this configuration are:\n*   **Image charge magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Image charge position:** `b = R^2 / d` (measured from the center, on the line connecting the center to `q`)\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy\nThere are two common ways to calculate the potential energy of this system.\n\n#### Method A: Using the Work Integral\nThe potential energy `U` is the work `W` done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position `d`. The work is done against the electric force exerted by the induced charges on the sphere.\n`U = - ∫_∞^d F_electric · dr`\n\nThe force on charge `q` due to the sphere is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`. Let's say `q` is moved along the x-axis from `x = ∞` to `x = d`. The force on `q` when it is at a position `x` is:\n`F(x) = k * q * q' / (distance between them)^2`\nThe image charge `q'` at this point is `-qR/x` and its position is `R^2/x`. The distance between them is `x - R^2/x`.\n`F(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n\nThe force is attractive (negative sign). The work done by the electric field is `W_field = ∫_∞^d F(x) dx`. The potential energy is `U = -W_field`.\n`U = - ∫_∞^d [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx = k * q^2 * R ∫_∞^d x / (x^2 - R^2)^2 dx`\nUsing substitution `u = x^2 - R^2`, `du = 2x dx`:\n`∫ x / (x^2 - R^2)^2 dx = (1/2) ∫ u^-2 du = -1 / (2u) = -1 / (2(x^2 - R^2))`\n\nNow, evaluate the definite integral:\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [-1 / (2(x^2 - R^2))]` from `∞` to `d`.\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [(-1 / (2(d^2 - R^2))) - (-1 / (2(∞)))]`\n`U = - (k * q^2 * R) / (2 * (d^2 - R^2))`\n\n#### Method B: Using the General Energy Formula\nA more direct method uses the general formula for the electrostatic energy of a system of charges and conductors:\n`U = (1/2) * Σ q_i * V_i`\nwhere `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` created by all *other* charges in the system.\n\nFor our system, we have the point charge `q` and the grounded sphere, which has a total induced charge `Q_induced`.\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_at_q + (1/2) * Q_induced * V_sphere`\n\n1.  Since the sphere is grounded, `V_sphere = 0`. So the second term is zero.\n2.  `V_at_q` is the potential at the location of charge `q` due to the induced charges on the sphere.\n\nThe beauty of the method of images is that this potential, `V_at_q`, is exactly the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of `q`.\n*   Location of `q` is `d`.\n*   Image charge `q' = -qR/d` is at `b = R^2/d`.\n*   Distance between `q` and `q'` is `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`.\n\nThe potential at `d` due to `q'` is:\n`V_at_q = k * q' / (d - b) = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n`V_at_q = - k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nNow, substitute this back into the energy formula:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_at_q = (1/2) * q * [- k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nBoth methods yield the same result. The potential energy of the system is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the net potential energy of the system.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Setup and the Method of Images\n\nWe have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. A grounded sphere is an equipotential surface with a potential of V=0. The presence of the charge `q` induces charges on the surface of the sphere to maintain this zero potential.\n\nTo solve this problem, we use the **Method of Images**. This method replaces the complex induced charge distribution on the sphere with a single, imaginary \"image charge\" `q'` placed inside the sphere. The combination of the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must reproduce the boundary condition, which is V=0 on the surface of the sphere (at radius `r=R`).\n\n### 2. Finding the Image Charge and its Location\n\nIt can be shown that the boundary condition (V=0 at `r=R`) is satisfied if we place an image charge `q'` at a distance `b` from the center, along the line connecting the center and the original charge `q`. The values for `q'` and `b` are:\n\n*   **Image charge magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Image charge location:** `b = R^2 / d`\n\nThe system of `q` and the grounded sphere is now electrostatically equivalent (for the region outside the sphere) to a system of two point charges: `q` at distance `d` from the origin and `q'` at distance `b` from the origin.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from an infinite distance to the distance `d` from the center of the sphere. The force on the charge `q` is due to the electric field of the induced charges on the sphere. Using the method of images, this force is simply the Coulomb force exerted by the image charge `q'` on the real charge `q`.\n\nHowever, we must be careful. The magnitude and position of the image charge depend on the position of the real charge `q`. Therefore, we cannot simply calculate the potential energy as `k*q*q'/(d-b)`. We must calculate the work by integrating the force over the path.\n\nA more direct method is to use the general formula for electrostatic energy in the presence of conductors:\n`U = (1/2) * Σ q_i * V_i`\nwhere `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` created by all *other* charges in the system.\n\nIn our case, the system consists of the point charge `q` and the charge distribution on the grounded sphere.\n`U = (1/2) * [ q * V_sphere_at_q + ∫ V_on_sphere * σ dS ]`\n\n1.  Since the sphere is grounded, its potential `V_on_sphere` is 0. Therefore, the second term of the equation is zero.\n    `∫ V_on_sphere * σ dS = ∫ 0 * σ dS = 0`\n\n2.  The term `V_sphere_at_q` represents the potential at the location of the charge `q` due to the induced charges on the sphere. By the method of images, this potential is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of `q`.\n\n    *   The location of `q` is at distance `d` from the center.\n    *   The location of `q'` is at distance `b = R^2/d` from the center.\n    *   The distance between `q` and `q'` is `d - b`.\n\n    The potential at `q` due to `q'` is:\n    `V_sphere_at_q = k * q' / (d - b)`\n\n3.  Now, substitute the values of `q'` and `b`:\n    `V_sphere_at_q = k * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d)`\n    `V_sphere_at_q = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n    `V_sphere_at_q = - k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n4.  Finally, substitute this potential back into the energy formula:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_sphere_at_q`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [ -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThis result represents the net potential energy of the system. The negative sign indicates that the force between the charge and the sphere is attractive, and energy is released as the charge is brought closer from infinity.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nComparing our derived result with the given options:\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical System:**\n    We have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is connected to the Earth and its electric potential is held constant at zero (`V_sphere = 0`). The presence of the charge `q` induces a redistribution of charges on the surface of the sphere to maintain this zero potential. The net force between the charge `q` and the sphere is attractive. We need to find the total potential energy of this system.\n\n2.  **Apply the Method of Images:**\n    This problem is elegantly solved using the \"method of images.\" The electric field and potential *outside* the sphere, created by the induced charges on its surface, can be perfectly replicated by a single, fictitious \"image charge\" `q'` placed *inside* the sphere. The value and position of this image charge are chosen such that the potential on the surface of the sphere (at `r=R`) becomes zero.\n\n3.  **Determine the Image Charge (q') and its Position (d'):**\n    For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` and its distance `d'` from the center are given by the standard formulas:\n    *   Position of the image charge: `d' = R^2 / d`\n    *   Magnitude of the image charge: `q' = - (R/d) * q`\n\n    The image charge is located along the same line connecting the center and the original charge `q`. The negative sign indicates that the image charge has the opposite polarity to `q`, which is consistent with an attractive force.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy (U):**\n    The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`.

Understanding the Physical System and Method\nThe problem involves a point charge `q` placed near a grounded conducting sphere. A grounded conductor is held at a constant potential, which we can set to zero (V=0). The presence of the charge `q` will induce charges on the surface of the sphere. To find the potential and forces, the most effective method is the **method of images**.\n\n### 2. Applying the Method of Images\nThe method of images states that the electric field outside the sphere can be modeled by replacing the sphere with a single, appropriately chosen \"image charge\" `q'` inside the sphere. The combination of the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must produce a potential of V=0 at all points on the surface of the sphere (where r=R).\n\nThe standard results for this configuration are:\n*   **Image charge magnitude (q'):** The image charge is located on the line connecting the center of the sphere and the original charge `q`. Its magnitude is given by:\n    `q' = - (R/d) * q`\n\n*   **Image charge position (b):** The distance of the image charge from the center of the sphere is:\n    `b = R^2 / d`\n\nThe system of the original charge `q` and the induced charges on the sphere is now replaced by a simpler system of two point charges: `q` at distance `d` and `q'` at distance `b` from the origin.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy\nThe net potential energy of the system is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d` from the center of the sphere. The force on the charge `q` is due to the induced charges on the sphere, which, by the method of images, is simply the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\nThere are two common ways to calculate this energy:\n\n**Method 1: Integrating the Force**\n\n1.  The force on the charge `q` when it is at a distance `x` from the center of the sphere is the Coulomb force between `q` and its image `q'`.\n    *   Force `F(x) = k * q * q' / (distance between them)^2`\n    *   At position `x`, the image charge is `q'(x) = -qR/x` and its position is `b(x) = R^2/x`.\n    *   The distance between them is `x - b(x) = x - R^2/x`.\n    *   `F(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n    The force is attractive (negative sign).\n\n2.  The potential energy `U` is the work done against this force, which is the negative of the work done by the field.\n    `U = - W_field = - ∫(from ∞ to d) F(x) dx`\n    `U = - ∫(from ∞ to d) [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n    `U = k * q^2 * R ∫(from ∞ to d) x / (x^2 - R^2)^2 dx`\n\n3.  To solve the integral, we use substitution. Let `u = x^2 - R^2`, then `du = 2x dx`.\n    `U = k * q^2 * R ∫ (1/2) * (1/u^2) du`\n    `U = (1/2) * k * q^2 * R * [-1/u]` evaluated from `x=∞` to `x=d`.\n    The limits for `u` are `∞` and `d^2 - R^2`.\n    `U = (1/2) * k * q^2 * R * [-1/(d^2 - R^2) - (-1/∞)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**Method 2: Using the Potential `U = (1/2)qV`**\n\n1.  The energy of a system of conductors and charges can be expressed as `U = (1/2) Σ q_i V_i`, where `V_i` is the potential at the location of `q_i` due to all other charges.\n\n2.  In our system, we have the point charge `q` and the conducting sphere. The sphere is grounded, so its potential `V_sphere = 0`. Thus, its contribution to the energy sum is zero.\n\n3.  The total energy is therefore just the energy of the point charge `q` in the potential created by the induced charges on the sphere.\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    The factor of 1/2 is crucial because the potential `V_induced` is created by the charge `q` itself. We must not double-count the interaction energy.\n\n4.  The potential at the location of `q` (at distance `d`) due to the induced charges on the sphere (`V_induced`) is, by the method of images, equal to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that same location.\n    `V_induced = V_image = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\n    `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / (d - b) = k * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d)`\n    `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d) = - k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n5.

Understanding the Problem and Method of Images**\n\nWe have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R` (where `d > R`). A grounded sphere has an electric potential of zero (V=0). The presence of the charge `q` induces an opposite charge on the surface of the sphere, resulting in an attractive force between the charge and the sphere.\n\nTo solve this problem, we use the **method of images**. This technique replaces the complex charge distribution on the sphere with a single, fictitious \"image charge\" `q'` placed inside the sphere. The electric field *outside* the sphere is then the superposition of the fields from the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'`. The magnitude and position of `q'` are chosen such that the boundary condition (V=0 on the sphere's surface) is satisfied.\n\n**2. Finding the Image Charge and its Position**\n\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` and its position `b` (distance from the center) are given by:\n\n*   Image charge magnitude: `q' = - (R/d) * q`\n*   Image charge position: `b = R^2 / d`\n\nThe image charge is located on the same line connecting the center and the original charge `q`.\n\n**3. Calculating the Potential Energy**\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. A common and reliable formula for the interaction energy of a charge with a system of conductors is:\n\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\nwhere `V_induced` is the potential at the location of charge `q` created by all *other* charges in the system. In this case, `V_induced` is the potential created by the induced charges on the surface of the sphere.\n\nAccording to the method of images, this potential `V_induced` is exactly the same as the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the position of the original charge `q`.\n\n**4. Calculating V_induced**\n\nThe potential `V_induced` at distance `d` from the center is the potential due to the image charge `q'` located at distance `b` from the center. The distance between the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` is `d - b`.\n\n*   `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n\n*   `V_induced = k * (- (R/d) * q) / (d - R^2 / d)`\n\nLet's simplify the denominator:\n\n*   `d - R^2 / d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\nSubstitute this back into the expression for `V_induced`:\n\n*   `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n*   `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**5. Calculating the Final Potential Energy (U)**\n\nNow we substitute the expression for `V_induced` back into the energy formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`:\n\n*   `U = (1/2) * q * [ -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n*   `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThis is the net potential energy of the system.

Understanding the Problem\n\nWe have a point charge `q` located at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means its electric potential is held at zero (`V_sphere = 0`). We need to find the total potential energy of this configuration.\n\n### 2. The Method of Images\n\nThis problem is a classic application of the \"method of images.\" To satisfy the boundary condition that the potential is zero on the surface of the sphere, we can replace the sphere with an \"image charge\" `q'` placed at a specific location `d'` inside the sphere. The electric field outside the sphere is then the superposition of the fields from the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.\n\nFor a grounded conducting sphere, the image charge `q'` and its position `d'` are given by:\n*   Image charge magnitude: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   Image charge position: `d' = R^2 / d` (measured from the center, on the same line as the original charge `q`)\n\nThe negative sign of `q'` indicates that the force between the real charge `q` and the induced charge on the sphere is attractive.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe potential energy `U` of the system is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`.\n\nThere are two common ways to calculate this energy:\n\n#### Method 1: Integrating the Force\n\nThe work `U` is the integral of the external force required to move the charge, which is the negative of the electric force `F(x)` exerted by the sphere on the charge `q`.\n`U = - ∫(from ∞ to d) F(x) dx`\n\nAs we bring the charge `q` from a position `x` to `d`, the image charge `q'` and its position `d'` also change depending on `x`. At any given position `x`, the force on charge `q` due to the sphere is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'(x)` at position `d'(x)`.\n\n*   `q'(x) = -q * R/x`\n*   `d'(x) = R^2 / x`\n\nThe distance between the charge `q` at `x` and its image `q'(x)` at `d'(x)` is `x - d'(x) = x - R^2/x`.\n\nThe force on `q` is given by Coulomb's law:\n`F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (x - d'(x))^2`\n`F(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2`\n`F(x) = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n\nNow, we integrate to find the work done (potential energy):\n`U = - ∫(from ∞ to d) F(x) dx = - ∫(from ∞ to d) [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n`U = k * q^2 * R * ∫(from ∞ to d) [x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n\nTo solve the integral, we use u-substitution. Let `u = x^2 - R^2`, so `du = 2x dx`, and `x dx = du/2`.\n`∫ [x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx = ∫ (1/u^2) * (du/2) = (1/2) * (-1/u) = -1 / (2(x^2 - R^2))`\n\nNow, we evaluate the definite integral:\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [ -1 / (2(x^2 - R^2)) ] (from ∞ to d)`\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [ (-1 / (2(d^2 - R^2))) - (-1 / (2(∞^2 - R^2))) ]`\nThe term with `∞` in the denominator goes to zero.\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [ -1 / (2(d^2 - R^2)) ]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n#### Method 2: Using Potential (Shortcut)\n\nThe potential energy of a charge `q` in the presence of conductors is given by `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of `q` created by the induced charges on the conductors. The factor of `1/2` is crucial and arises because the induced charges are not fixed but are themselves established by `q`.\n\n1.  **Find the potential at the location of `q` due to the image charge `q'`.**\n    The real charge `q` is at distance `d`. The image charge `q' = -qR/d` is at distance `d' = R^2/d`.\n    The distance between `q` and `q'` is `Δx = d - d' = d - R^2/d`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the potential `V_induced`:**\n    The potential at position `d` due to the image charge is:\n    `V_induced = k * q' / Δx = k * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d)`\n    `V_induced = -k * qR / d * (1 / ((d^2 - R^2)/d))`\n    `V_induced = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n3.  **Calculate the potential energy `U`:**\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [ -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The net potential energy of the system is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis problem can be solved using the method of images.

The charge `q` is at a distance `d` from the sphere's center (`d > R`). The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means its electric potential is held at a constant value, V = 0. We need to find the total potential energy `U` of this configuration.\n\n2.  **Apply the Method of Images:** The electric field outside the conducting sphere is identical to the field that would be created by the original charge `q` and an \"image charge\" `q'` placed at a specific point `b` inside the sphere (while removing the sphere itself). The values of `q'` and `b` are chosen such that the potential on the spherical surface where the conductor used to be is zero.\n\n    *   For a point charge `q` at distance `d` from the center of a grounded sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` and its position `b` are given by:\n        *   Image charge magnitude: `q' = -q (R/d)`\n        *   Image charge position: `b = R^2/d` (measured from the center, along the same line as `q`).\n\n    This image system (`q` at `d` and `q'` at `b`) perfectly replicates the electric field outside `r=R` and guarantees that the potential at `r=R` is zero.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Potential Energy:** The potential energy `U` of the system is the work done to assemble it. A general formula for the potential energy of a system of charges and conductors is `U = (1/2) Σ_i q_i V_i`, where `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` due to all other charges in the system.\n\n    *   Our system consists of the point charge `q` and the conducting sphere. So the energy can be written as the sum of the energy associated with the point charge and the energy associated with the charge distribution on the sphere:\n        `U = (1/2) q V_at_q + (1/2) ∫ V_sphere σ dA`\n\n    *   The second term represents the energy of the induced charges `σ` on the sphere's surface. Since the sphere is grounded, its potential `V_sphere` is 0 everywhere on its surface. Therefore, the second term `(1/2) ∫ (0) σ dA = 0`.\n\n    *   This leaves us with `U = (1/2) q V_at_q`.

Problem Setup and Method of Images**\n\nWe have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R` (where `d > R`). A grounded sphere has an electric potential of zero (V=0).\n\nThe presence of the charge `q` induces charges on the surface of the sphere. The electric field outside the sphere is the superposition of the field from the point charge `q` and the field from the induced charges on the sphere.\n\nThe \"method of images\" provides a powerful way to solve this problem. We can replace the sphere and its induced charges with a single, appropriately chosen \"image charge\" `q'` located inside the sphere. The electric field outside the original sphere's volume will be identical to the field produced by the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.\n\nFor a grounded sphere, the image charge `q'` must be placed such that the potential on the surface of the sphere (at radius `R`) is zero. The standard results for this configuration are:\n\n*   **Image charge magnitude (q'):** The image charge is located on the line connecting the center and the charge `q`. Its magnitude is:\n    `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n\n*   **Image charge position (b):** The distance of the image charge from the center of the sphere is:\n    `b = R^2 / d`\n\n### **2. Calculating the Potential Energy**\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from an infinite distance to its final position `d`, while the sphere remains grounded.\n\nThere are a couple of ways to calculate this energy.\n\n**Method 1: Integration of Force**\n\nThe potential energy `U` is the negative of the work `W_field` done by the electric field of the induced charge as `q` is brought from infinity.\n`U = -W_field = -∫(from ∞ to d) F_induced ⋅ dr`\n\nThe force on the charge `q` due to the induced charges on the sphere is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`. As the position of `q` changes (let's call its variable position `x`), the magnitude and position of its image also change (`q'(x) = -qR/x`, `b(x) = R²/x`).\n\nThe attractive force on charge `q` at a distance `x` from the center is:\n`F(x) = k * q * q' / (x - b)^2 = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R²/x)²`\n`F(x) = -k * q² * R * x / (x² - R²)²`\n\nThe potential energy `U` is:\n`U = -W_field = - ∫(from ∞ to d) F(x) dx`\n`U = - ∫(from ∞ to d) [-k * q² * R * x / (x² - R²)²] dx`\n`U = k * q² * R ∫(from ∞ to d) [x / (x² - R²)²] dx`\n\nTo solve the integral, we use the substitution `u = x² - R²`, so `du = 2x dx`, or `x dx = du/2`.\n`∫ [x / (x² - R²)²] dx = ∫ [1/u²] (du/2) = (1/2) * (-1/u) = -1 / (2(x² - R²))`\n\nNow, evaluating the definite integral:\n`U = k * q² * R * [ -1 / (2(x² - R²)) ](from ∞ to d)`\n`U = k * q² * R * [ (-1 / (2(d² - R²))) - (-1 / (2(∞² - R²))) ]`\n`U = k * q² * R * [ -1 / (2(d² - R²)) - 0 ]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\n**Method 2: Using the Interaction Energy of the Image System**\n\nA well-known result from electrostatics states that the potential energy of a point charge `q` in the presence of a grounded conductor is equal to half the interaction energy between the charge `q` and its image `q'`.\n\n`U = (1/2) * U_interaction = (1/2) * (k * q * q' / r)`\n\nwhere `r` is the distance between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.\n\n*   `r = d - b = d - R²/d = (d² - R²)/d`\n*   `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n\nNow, substitute these into the energy formula:\n`U = (1/2) * k * q * [-q(R/d)] / [(d² - R²)/d]`\nThe `d` in the denominator of both the numerator and the denominator cancels out.\n`U = (1/2) * k * q * [-qR] / [d² - R²]`\n`U = -(1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\n### **3. Conclusion**\n\nBoth methods yield the same result for the net potential energy of the system:\n`U = -(1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\nThis expression is negative, which is expected because the charge `q` is attracted to the grounded sphere (as the induced charge is of the opposite sign overall).\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\n*   A) `U = - kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)`\n*   B) `U = -(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)`\n*   C) `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)`\n*   D) `U = - (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)`\n\nOur derived formula `U = -(1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)` exactly matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical System and the Problem:**\n    The problem asks for the net potential energy of a system composed of a point charge `q` and a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. The charge `q` is located at a distance `d` from the center of the sphere, where `d > R`. A \"grounded\" sphere has a constant potential of zero (V=0).\n\n2.  **Apply the Method of Images:**\n    To solve this electrostatics problem, we use the method of images. This technique allows us to replace the complex induced charge distribution on the surface of the conducting sphere with a single, strategically placed \"image charge\" inside the sphere. The electric field and potential *outside* the sphere are the same in both the original problem and the simplified image-charge problem.\n\n3.  **Determine the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b):**\n    For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` must be placed such that the potential at the surface of the sphere (at radius R) is zero. The established results for this configuration are:\n    *   The position of the image charge, `b`, from the center along the line connecting the center and `q`, is `b = R^2 / d`.\n    *   The magnitude of the image charge is `q' = -q * (R/d)`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy:**\n    The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d` from the center of the sphere. As the charge `q` is brought in, the sphere remains grounded, and an induced charge builds up on its surface. The force on `q` is due to this induced charge.\n\n    Using the method of images, the force on `q` is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`. However, it's crucial to realize that as `q` moves from infinity to `d`, the image charge `q'` also changes its magnitude and position. Therefore, we must integrate the force over the path.\n\n    Let's consider an intermediate position `x` for the charge `q` (`x > R`). At this point:\n    *   The image charge is `q'(x) = -qR/x`.\n    *   Its position is `b(x) = R^2/x`.\n    *   The distance between `q` at `x` and `q'(x)` at `b(x)` is `x - b(x) = x - R^2/x`.\n\n    The force on charge `q` at position `x` is the attractive Coulomb force from the image charge:\n    `F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (x - b(x))^2 = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2`\n    `F(x) = -k * q^2 * R / (x * (x^2 - R^2)^2 / x^2) = - (k * q^2 * R * x) / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n\n    The potential energy `U` is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity to `d`. This is the negative of the work done by the electric field:\n    `U = - W_field = - ∫[from ∞ to d] F(x) dx`\n    `U = - ∫[from ∞ to d] [- (k * q^2 * R * x) / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n    `U = (k * q^2 * R) ∫[from ∞ to d] x / (x^2 - R^2)^2 dx`\n\n    To solve the integral, we use the substitution `u = x^2 - R^2`, which gives `du = 2x dx`, or `x dx = du/2`. The limits of integration become:\n    *   When `x → ∞`, `u → ∞`.\n    *   When `x = d`, `u = d^2 - R^2`.\n\n    `U = (k * q^2 * R) ∫[from ∞ to d^2-R^2] (1/u^2) (du/2)`\n    `U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [-1/u] |_[from ∞ to d^2-R^2]`\n    `U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [ -1/(d^2 - R^2) - (-1/∞) ]`\n    `U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [ -1/(d^2 - R^2) ]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * (k * q^2 * R) / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n5.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated potential energy `U = - (1/2) * k*q^2*R / (d^2 - R^2)` matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis problem can be solved using the method of images.\n\n1.  **The Setup:** We have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is grounded, which means its electric potential is maintained at zero (`V = 0`).\n\n2.  **Method of Images:** The electric field outside the sphere, created by the charge `q` and the induced charges on the sphere's surface, can be simplified. We can replace the sphere and its induced charges with a single \"image charge\" `q'` placed at a specific location inside the sphere. The combination of the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must reproduce the boundary condition that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero.\n\n3.  **Finding the Image Charge and its Position:** For a point charge `q` at distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` and its distance `b` from the center are given by the standard formulas:\n    *   Image charge magnitude: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   Image charge position: `b = R^2 / d`\n    The image charge lies on the line connecting the center of the sphere and the original charge `q`.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Potential Energy:** The net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. A common misconception is to simply calculate the potential energy between `q` and `q'`. The correct way is to consider that the induced charge (and thus the image charge) changes as `q` is brought closer.\n\n    The potential energy `U` of the interaction between the charge `q` and the grounded sphere can be found by calculating half the potential energy of `q` in the field of its image `q'`. The factor of 1/2 is crucial because the induced charge on the sphere is created by the field of `q` itself; the system's energy is built up gradually.\n\n    *   The potential at the location of charge `q` due to the image charge `q'` is `V_image`.\n    *   The distance between the charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\n    *   `d - b = d - (R^2 / d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`.\n    *   The potential `V_image` is:\n        `V_image = k * q' / (d - b)`\n        Substituting the expressions for `q'` and `(d-b)`:\n        `V_image = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n        `V_image = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    *   The potential energy `U` of the system is half the product of the charge `q` and the potential at its location due to the other charges (which are represented by the image charge).\n        `U = (1/2) * q * V_image`\n        `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n5.  **Comparing with the Options:**\n    The calculated potential energy is `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n\n    Let's check the given options:\n    A) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)  (Incorrect, has R^2)\n    B) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)   (Correct)\n    C) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)       (Incorrect, misses 1/2 and has 'd' in numerator)\n    D) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)   (Incorrect, has 'd' in numerator and '+' in denominator)\n\nThe final answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

Calculating the Potential Energy\nThere are two common ways to calculate the potential energy of this system.\n\n#### Method A: Using the Work Integral\nThe potential energy `U` is the work `W` done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position `d`. The work is done against the electric force exerted by the induced charges on the sphere.\n`U = - ∫_∞^d F_electric · dr`\n\nThe force on charge `q` due to the sphere is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`. Let's say `q` is moved along the x-axis from `x = ∞` to `x = d`. The force on `q` when it is at a position `x` is:\n`F(x) = k * q * q' / (distance between them)^2`\nThe image charge `q'` at this point is `-qR/x` and its position is `R^2/x`. The distance between them is `x - R^2/x`.\n`F(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n\nThe force is attractive (negative sign). The work done by the electric field is `W_field = ∫_∞^d F(x) dx`. The potential energy is `U = -W_field`.\n`U = - ∫_∞^d [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx = k * q^2 * R ∫_∞^d x / (x^2 - R^2)^2 dx`\nUsing substitution `u = x^2 - R^2`, `du = 2x dx`:\n`∫ x / (x^2 - R^2)^2 dx = (1/2) ∫ u^-2 du = -1 / (2u) = -1 / (2(x^2 - R^2))`\n\nNow, evaluate the definite integral:\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [-1 / (2(x^2 - R^2))]` from `∞` to `d`.\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [(-1 / (2(d^2 - R^2))) - (-1 / (2(∞)))]`\n`U = - (k * q^2 * R) / (2 * (d^2 - R^2))`\n\n#### Method B: Using the General Energy Formula\nA more direct method uses the general formula for the electrostatic energy of a system of charges and conductors:\n`U = (1/2) * Σ q_i * V_i`\nwhere `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` created by all *other* charges in the system.\n\nFor our system, we have the point charge `q` and the grounded sphere, which has a total induced charge `Q_induced`.\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_at_q + (1/2) * Q_induced * V_sphere`\n\n1.  Since the sphere is grounded, `V_sphere = 0`. So the second term is zero.\n2.  `V_at_q` is the potential at the location of charge `q` due to the induced charges on the sphere.\n\nThe beauty of the method of images is that this potential, `V_at_q`, is exactly the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of `q`.\n*   Location of `q` is `d`.\n*   Image charge `q' = -qR/d` is at `b = R^2/d`.\n*   Distance between `q` and `q'` is `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`.\n\nThe potential at `d` due to `q'` is:\n`V_at_q = k * q' / (d - b) = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n`V_at_q = - k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nNow, substitute this back into the energy formula:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_at_q = (1/2) * q * [- k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nBoth methods yield the same result. The potential energy of the system is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the net potential energy of the system.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Setup and the Method of Images\n\nWe have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. A grounded sphere is an equipotential surface with a potential of V=0. The presence of the charge `q` induces charges on the surface of the sphere to maintain this zero potential.\n\nTo solve this problem, we use the **Method of Images**. This method replaces the complex induced charge distribution on the sphere with a single, imaginary \"image charge\" `q'` placed inside the sphere. The combination of the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must reproduce the boundary condition, which is V=0 on the surface of the sphere (at radius `r=R`).\n\n### 2. Finding the Image Charge and its Location\n\nIt can be shown that the boundary condition (V=0 at `r=R`) is satisfied if we place an image charge `q'` at a distance `b` from the center, along the line connecting the center and the original charge `q`. The values for `q'` and `b` are:\n\n*   **Image charge magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Image charge location:** `b = R^2 / d`\n\nThe system of `q` and the grounded sphere is now electrostatically equivalent (for the region outside the sphere) to a system of two point charges: `q` at distance `d` from the origin and `q'` at distance `b` from the origin.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from an infinite distance to the distance `d` from the center of the sphere. The force on the charge `q` is due to the electric field of the induced charges on the sphere. Using the method of images, this force is simply the Coulomb force exerted by the image charge `q'` on the real charge `q`.\n\nHowever, we must be careful. The magnitude and position of the image charge depend on the position of the real charge `q`. Therefore, we cannot simply calculate the potential energy as `k*q*q'/(d-b)`. We must calculate the work by integrating the force over the path.\n\nA more direct method is to use the general formula for electrostatic energy in the presence of conductors:\n`U = (1/2) * Σ q_i * V_i`\nwhere `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` created by all *other* charges in the system.\n\nIn our case, the system consists of the point charge `q` and the charge distribution on the grounded sphere.\n`U = (1/2) * [ q * V_sphere_at_q + ∫ V_on_sphere * σ dS ]`\n\n1.  Since the sphere is grounded, its potential `V_on_sphere` is 0. Therefore, the second term of the equation is zero.\n    `∫ V_on_sphere * σ dS = ∫ 0 * σ dS = 0`\n\n2.  The term `V_sphere_at_q` represents the potential at the location of the charge `q` due to the induced charges on the sphere. By the method of images, this potential is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of `q`.\n\n    *   The location of `q` is at distance `d` from the center.\n    *   The location of `q'` is at distance `b = R^2/d` from the center.\n    *   The distance between `q` and `q'` is `d - b`.\n\n    The potential at `q` due to `q'` is:\n    `V_sphere_at_q = k * q' / (d - b)`\n\n3.  Now, substitute the values of `q'` and `b`:\n    `V_sphere_at_q = k * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d)`\n    `V_sphere_at_q = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n    `V_sphere_at_q = - k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n4.  Finally, substitute this potential back into the energy formula:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_sphere_at_q`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [ -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThis result represents the net potential energy of the system. The negative sign indicates that the force between the charge and the sphere is attractive, and energy is released as the charge is brought closer from infinity.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nComparing our derived result with the given options:\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical System:**\n    We have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is connected to the Earth and its electric potential is held constant at zero (`V_sphere = 0`). The presence of the charge `q` induces a redistribution of charges on the surface of the sphere to maintain this zero potential. The net force between the charge `q` and the sphere is attractive. We need to find the total potential energy of this system.\n\n2.  **Apply the Method of Images:**\n    This problem is elegantly solved using the \"method of images.\" The electric field and potential *outside* the sphere, created by the induced charges on its surface, can be perfectly replicated by a single, fictitious \"image charge\" `q'` placed *inside* the sphere. The value and position of this image charge are chosen such that the potential on the surface of the sphere (at `r=R`) becomes zero.\n\n3.  **Determine the Image Charge (q') and its Position (d'):**\n    For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` and its distance `d'` from the center are given by the standard formulas:\n    *   Position of the image charge: `d' = R^2 / d`\n    *   Magnitude of the image charge: `q' = - (R/d) * q`\n\n    The image charge is located along the same line connecting the center and the original charge `q`. The negative sign indicates that the image charge has the opposite polarity to `q`, which is consistent with an attractive force.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy (U):**\n    The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`.

Understanding the Physical System and Method\nThe problem involves a point charge `q` placed near a grounded conducting sphere. A grounded conductor is held at a constant potential, which we can set to zero (V=0). The presence of the charge `q` will induce charges on the surface of the sphere. To find the potential and forces, the most effective method is the **method of images**.\n\n### 2. Applying the Method of Images\nThe method of images states that the electric field outside the sphere can be modeled by replacing the sphere with a single, appropriately chosen \"image charge\" `q'` inside the sphere. The combination of the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must produce a potential of V=0 at all points on the surface of the sphere (where r=R).\n\nThe standard results for this configuration are:\n*   **Image charge magnitude (q'):** The image charge is located on the line connecting the center of the sphere and the original charge `q`. Its magnitude is given by:\n    `q' = - (R/d) * q`\n\n*   **Image charge position (b):** The distance of the image charge from the center of the sphere is:\n    `b = R^2 / d`\n\nThe system of the original charge `q` and the induced charges on the sphere is now replaced by a simpler system of two point charges: `q` at distance `d` and `q'` at distance `b` from the origin.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy\nThe net potential energy of the system is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d` from the center of the sphere. The force on the charge `q` is due to the induced charges on the sphere, which, by the method of images, is simply the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\nThere are two common ways to calculate this energy:\n\n**Method 1: Integrating the Force**\n\n1.  The force on the charge `q` when it is at a distance `x` from the center of the sphere is the Coulomb force between `q` and its image `q'`.\n    *   Force `F(x) = k * q * q' / (distance between them)^2`\n    *   At position `x`, the image charge is `q'(x) = -qR/x` and its position is `b(x) = R^2/x`.\n    *   The distance between them is `x - b(x) = x - R^2/x`.\n    *   `F(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n    The force is attractive (negative sign).\n\n2.  The potential energy `U` is the work done against this force, which is the negative of the work done by the field.\n    `U = - W_field = - ∫(from ∞ to d) F(x) dx`\n    `U = - ∫(from ∞ to d) [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n    `U = k * q^2 * R ∫(from ∞ to d) x / (x^2 - R^2)^2 dx`\n\n3.  To solve the integral, we use substitution. Let `u = x^2 - R^2`, then `du = 2x dx`.\n    `U = k * q^2 * R ∫ (1/2) * (1/u^2) du`\n    `U = (1/2) * k * q^2 * R * [-1/u]` evaluated from `x=∞` to `x=d`.\n    The limits for `u` are `∞` and `d^2 - R^2`.\n    `U = (1/2) * k * q^2 * R * [-1/(d^2 - R^2) - (-1/∞)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**Method 2: Using the Potential `U = (1/2)qV`**\n\n1.  The energy of a system of conductors and charges can be expressed as `U = (1/2) Σ q_i V_i`, where `V_i` is the potential at the location of `q_i` due to all other charges.\n\n2.  In our system, we have the point charge `q` and the conducting sphere. The sphere is grounded, so its potential `V_sphere = 0`. Thus, its contribution to the energy sum is zero.\n\n3.  The total energy is therefore just the energy of the point charge `q` in the potential created by the induced charges on the sphere.\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    The factor of 1/2 is crucial because the potential `V_induced` is created by the charge `q` itself. We must not double-count the interaction energy.\n\n4.  The potential at the location of `q` (at distance `d`) due to the induced charges on the sphere (`V_induced`) is, by the method of images, equal to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that same location.\n    `V_induced = V_image = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\n    `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / (d - b) = k * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d)`\n    `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d) = - k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n5.

Understanding the Problem\n\nWe have a point charge `q` located at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means its electric potential is held at zero (`V_sphere = 0`). We need to find the total potential energy of this configuration.\n\n### 2. The Method of Images\n\nThis problem is a classic application of the \"method of images.\" To satisfy the boundary condition that the potential is zero on the surface of the sphere, we can replace the sphere with an \"image charge\" `q'` placed at a specific location `d'` inside the sphere. The electric field outside the sphere is then the superposition of the fields from the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.\n\nFor a grounded conducting sphere, the image charge `q'` and its position `d'` are given by:\n*   Image charge magnitude: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   Image charge position: `d' = R^2 / d` (measured from the center, on the same line as the original charge `q`)\n\nThe negative sign of `q'` indicates that the force between the real charge `q` and the induced charge on the sphere is attractive.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe potential energy `U` of the system is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`.\n\nThere are two common ways to calculate this energy:\n\n#### Method 1: Integrating the Force\n\nThe work `U` is the integral of the external force required to move the charge, which is the negative of the electric force `F(x)` exerted by the sphere on the charge `q`.\n`U = - ∫(from ∞ to d) F(x) dx`\n\nAs we bring the charge `q` from a position `x` to `d`, the image charge `q'` and its position `d'` also change depending on `x`. At any given position `x`, the force on charge `q` due to the sphere is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'(x)` at position `d'(x)`.\n\n*   `q'(x) = -q * R/x`\n*   `d'(x) = R^2 / x`\n\nThe distance between the charge `q` at `x` and its image `q'(x)` at `d'(x)` is `x - d'(x) = x - R^2/x`.\n\nThe force on `q` is given by Coulomb's law:\n`F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (x - d'(x))^2`\n`F(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2`\n`F(x) = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n\nNow, we integrate to find the work done (potential energy):\n`U = - ∫(from ∞ to d) F(x) dx = - ∫(from ∞ to d) [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n`U = k * q^2 * R * ∫(from ∞ to d) [x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n\nTo solve the integral, we use u-substitution. Let `u = x^2 - R^2`, so `du = 2x dx`, and `x dx = du/2`.\n`∫ [x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx = ∫ (1/u^2) * (du/2) = (1/2) * (-1/u) = -1 / (2(x^2 - R^2))`\n\nNow, we evaluate the definite integral:\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [ -1 / (2(x^2 - R^2)) ] (from ∞ to d)`\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [ (-1 / (2(d^2 - R^2))) - (-1 / (2(∞^2 - R^2))) ]`\nThe term with `∞` in the denominator goes to zero.\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [ -1 / (2(d^2 - R^2)) ]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n#### Method 2: Using Potential (Shortcut)\n\nThe potential energy of a charge `q` in the presence of conductors is given by `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of `q` created by the induced charges on the conductors. The factor of `1/2` is crucial and arises because the induced charges are not fixed but are themselves established by `q`.\n\n1.  **Find the potential at the location of `q` due to the image charge `q'`.**\n    The real charge `q` is at distance `d`. The image charge `q' = -qR/d` is at distance `d' = R^2/d`.\n    The distance between `q` and `q'` is `Δx = d - d' = d - R^2/d`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the potential `V_induced`:**\n    The potential at position `d` due to the image charge is:\n    `V_induced = k * q' / Δx = k * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d)`\n    `V_induced = -k * qR / d * (1 / ((d^2 - R^2)/d))`\n    `V_induced = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n3.  **Calculate the potential energy `U`:**\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [ -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The net potential energy of the system is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis problem can be solved using the method of images.

The charge `q` is at a distance `d` from the sphere's center (`d > R`). The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means its electric potential is held at a constant value, V = 0.

Problem Setup and Method of Images**\n\nWe have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R` (where `d > R`). A grounded sphere has an electric potential of zero (V=0).\n\nThe presence of the charge `q` induces charges on the surface of the sphere. The electric field outside the sphere is the superposition of the field from the point charge `q` and the field from the induced charges on the sphere.\n\nThe \"method of images\" provides a powerful way to solve this problem. We can replace the sphere and its induced charges with a single, appropriately chosen \"image charge\" `q'` located inside the sphere. The electric field outside the original sphere's volume will be identical to the field produced by the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.\n\nFor a grounded sphere, the image charge `q'` must be placed such that the potential on the surface of the sphere (at radius `R`) is zero. The standard results for this configuration are:\n\n*   **Image charge magnitude (q'):** The image charge is located on the line connecting the center and the charge `q`. Its magnitude is:\n    `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n\n*   **Image charge position (b):** The distance of the image charge from the center of the sphere is:\n    `b = R^2 / d`\n\n### **2. Calculating the Potential Energy**\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from an infinite distance to its final position `d`, while the sphere remains grounded.\n\nThere are a couple of ways to calculate this energy.\n\n**Method 1: Integration of Force**\n\nThe potential energy `U` is the negative of the work `W_field` done by the electric field of the induced charge as `q` is brought from infinity.\n`U = -W_field = -∫(from ∞ to d) F_induced ⋅ dr`\n\nThe force on the charge `q` due to the induced charges on the sphere is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`. As the position of `q` changes (let's call its variable position `x`), the magnitude and position of its image also change (`q'(x) = -qR/x`, `b(x) = R²/x`).\n\nThe attractive force on charge `q` at a distance `x` from the center is:\n`F(x) = k * q * q' / (x - b)^2 = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R²/x)²`\n`F(x) = -k * q² * R * x / (x² - R²)²`\n\nThe potential energy `U` is:\n`U = -W_field = - ∫(from ∞ to d) F(x) dx`\n`U = - ∫(from ∞ to d) [-k * q² * R * x / (x² - R²)²] dx`\n`U = k * q² * R ∫(from ∞ to d) [x / (x² - R²)²] dx`\n\nTo solve the integral, we use the substitution `u = x² - R²`, so `du = 2x dx`, or `x dx = du/2`.\n`∫ [x / (x² - R²)²] dx = ∫ [1/u²] (du/2) = (1/2) * (-1/u) = -1 / (2(x² - R²))`\n\nNow, evaluating the definite integral:\n`U = k * q² * R * [ -1 / (2(x² - R²)) ](from ∞ to d)`\n`U = k * q² * R * [ (-1 / (2(d² - R²))) - (-1 / (2(∞² - R²))) ]`\n`U = k * q² * R * [ -1 / (2(d² - R²)) - 0 ]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\n**Method 2: Using the Interaction Energy of the Image System**\n\nA well-known result from electrostatics states that the potential energy of a point charge `q` in the presence of a grounded conductor is equal to half the interaction energy between the charge `q` and its image `q'`.\n\n`U = (1/2) * U_interaction = (1/2) * (k * q * q' / r)`\n\nwhere `r` is the distance between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`.\n\n*   `r = d - b = d - R²/d = (d² - R²)/d`\n*   `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n\nNow, substitute these into the energy formula:\n`U = (1/2) * k * q * [-q(R/d)] / [(d² - R²)/d]`\nThe `d` in the denominator of both the numerator and the denominator cancels out.\n`U = (1/2) * k * q * [-qR] / [d² - R²]`\n`U = -(1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\n### **3. Conclusion**\n\nBoth methods yield the same result for the net potential energy of the system:\n`U = -(1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\nThis expression is negative, which is expected because the charge `q` is attracted to the grounded sphere (as the induced charge is of the opposite sign overall).\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\n*   A) `U = - kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)`\n*   B) `U = -(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)`\n*   C) `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)`\n*   D) `U = - (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)`\n\nOur derived formula `U = -(1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)` exactly matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical System and the Problem:**\n    The problem asks for the net potential energy of a system composed of a point charge `q` and a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. The charge `q` is located at a distance `d` from the center of the sphere, where `d > R`. A \"grounded\" sphere has a constant potential of zero (V=0).\n\n2.  **Apply the Method of Images:**\n    To solve this electrostatics problem, we use the method of images. This technique allows us to replace the complex induced charge distribution on the surface of the conducting sphere with a single, strategically placed \"image charge\" inside the sphere. The electric field and potential *outside* the sphere are the same in both the original problem and the simplified image-charge problem.\n\n3.  **Determine the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b):**\n    For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` must be placed such that the potential at the surface of the sphere (at radius R) is zero. The established results for this configuration are:\n    *   The position of the image charge, `b`, from the center along the line connecting the center and `q`, is `b = R^2 / d`.\n    *   The magnitude of the image charge is `q' = -q * (R/d)`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy:**\n    The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d` from the center of the sphere. As the charge `q` is brought in, the sphere remains grounded, and an induced charge builds up on its surface. The force on `q` is due to this induced charge.\n\n    Using the method of images, the force on `q` is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`. However, it's crucial to realize that as `q` moves from infinity to `d`, the image charge `q'` also changes its magnitude and position. Therefore, we must integrate the force over the path.\n\n    Let's consider an intermediate position `x` for the charge `q` (`x > R`). At this point:\n    *   The image charge is `q'(x) = -qR/x`.\n    *   Its position is `b(x) = R^2/x`.\n    *   The distance between `q` at `x` and `q'(x)` at `b(x)` is `x - b(x) = x - R^2/x`.\n\n    The force on charge `q` at position `x` is the attractive Coulomb force from the image charge:\n    `F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (x - b(x))^2 = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2`\n    `F(x) = -k * q^2 * R / (x * (x^2 - R^2)^2 / x^2) = - (k * q^2 * R * x) / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n\n    The potential energy `U` is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity to `d`. This is the negative of the work done by the electric field:\n    `U = - W_field = - ∫[from ∞ to d] F(x) dx`\n    `U = - ∫[from ∞ to d] [- (k * q^2 * R * x) / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n    `U = (k * q^2 * R) ∫[from ∞ to d] x / (x^2 - R^2)^2 dx`\n\n    To solve the integral, we use the substitution `u = x^2 - R^2`, which gives `du = 2x dx`, or `x dx = du/2`. The limits of integration become:\n    *   When `x → ∞`, `u → ∞`.\n    *   When `x = d`, `u = d^2 - R^2`.\n\n    `U = (k * q^2 * R) ∫[from ∞ to d^2-R^2] (1/u^2) (du/2)`\n    `U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [-1/u] |_[from ∞ to d^2-R^2]`\n    `U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [ -1/(d^2 - R^2) - (-1/∞) ]`\n    `U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [ -1/(d^2 - R^2) ]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * (k * q^2 * R) / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n5.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated potential energy `U = - (1/2) * k*q^2*R / (d^2 - R^2)` matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis problem can be solved using the method of images.\n\n1.  **The Setup:** We have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is grounded, which means its electric potential is maintained at zero (`V = 0`).\n\n2.  **Method of Images:** The electric field outside the sphere, created by the charge `q` and the induced charges on the sphere's surface, can be simplified. We can replace the sphere and its induced charges with a single \"image charge\" `q'` placed at a specific location inside the sphere. The combination of the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must reproduce the boundary condition that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero.\n\n3.  **Finding the Image Charge and its Position:** For a point charge `q` at distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` and its distance `b` from the center are given by the standard formulas:\n    *   Image charge magnitude: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   Image charge position: `b = R^2 / d`\n    The image charge lies on the line connecting the center of the sphere and the original charge `q`.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Potential Energy:** The net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. A common misconception is to simply calculate the potential energy between `q` and `q'`. The correct way is to consider that the induced charge (and thus the image charge) changes as `q` is brought closer.\n\n    The potential energy `U` of the interaction between the charge `q` and the grounded sphere can be found by calculating half the potential energy of `q` in the field of its image `q'`. The factor of 1/2 is crucial because the induced charge on the sphere is created by the field of `q` itself; the system's energy is built up gradually.\n\n    *   The potential at the location of charge `q` due to the image charge `q'` is `V_image`.\n    *   The distance between the charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\n    *   `d - b = d - (R^2 / d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`.\n    *   The potential `V_image` is:\n        `V_image = k * q' / (d - b)`\n        Substituting the expressions for `q'` and `(d-b)`:\n        `V_image = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n        `V_image = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    *   The potential energy `U` of the system is half the product of the charge `q` and the potential at its location due to the other charges (which are represented by the image charge).\n        `U = (1/2) * q * V_image`\n        `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n5.  **Comparing with the Options:**\n    The calculated potential energy is `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n\n    Let's check the given options:\n    A) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)  (Incorrect, has R^2)\n    B) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)   (Correct)\n    C) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)       (Incorrect, misses 1/2 and has 'd' in numerator)\n    D) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)   (Incorrect, has 'd' in numerator and '+' in denominator)\n\nThe final answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
