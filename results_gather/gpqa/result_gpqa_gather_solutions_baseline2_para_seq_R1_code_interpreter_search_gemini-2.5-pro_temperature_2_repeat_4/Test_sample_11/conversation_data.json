This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a breakdown of the problem:\n\n**1. Principles:**\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial pion (Pi+) is stationary, its momentum is zero. Therefore, the total momentum of the product particles (muon and neutrino) must also be zero. This means they fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n\n**2. Given Values:**\n*   Rest mass of Pi+ (`m_pi`): 139.6 MeV/c²\n*   Rest mass of mu+ (`m_mu`): 105.7 MeV/c²\n*   Rest mass of neutrino (`m_nu`): Assumed to be 0.\n\n**3. Energy Conservation Equation:**\n*   Initial Energy (`E_initial`): `m_pi * c² = 139.6 MeV` (since the pion is at rest)\n*   Final Energy (`E_final`): `E_mu` + `E_nu`\n*   So, `139.6 MeV = E_mu + E_nu`\n\nWhere `E_mu` is the total energy of the muon and `E_nu` is the total energy of the neutrino.\n\n**4. Momentum Conservation:**\n*   `p_mu` = `p_nu` (in magnitude)\n*   Let's call this momentum `p`.\n\n**5. Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\nThe total energy `E` of a particle is related to its rest mass `m` and momentum `p` by the equation: `E² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)²`\n\n*   For the neutrino (massless): `E_nu² = (p*c)²` => `E_nu = p*c`\n*   For the muon: `E_mu² = (p*c)² + (m_mu * c²)²`\n\n**6. Solving the System:**\nWe can solve for the energies of the product particles. A key step is to rearrange the energy-momentum relation for the muon to find `(p*c)²`:\n`(p*c)² = E_mu² - (m_mu * c²)²`\n\nNow substitute `p*c = E_nu` into this equation:\n`E_nu² = E_mu² - (m_mu * c²)²`  (Equation 1)\n\nFrom the energy conservation, we have `E_mu = (m_pi * c²) - E_nu`. Substitute this into Equation 1:\n`E_nu² = [(m_pi * c²) - E_nu]² - (m_mu * c²)²`\n`E_nu² = (m_pi * c²)² - 2*(m_pi * c²)*E_nu + E_nu² - (m_mu * c²)²`\n\nThe `E_nu²` terms cancel out. Rearranging to solve for `E_nu`:\n`2*(m_pi * c²)*E_nu = (m_pi * c²)² - (m_mu * c²)²`\n`E_nu = [(m_pi * c²)² - (m_mu * c²)²] / [2 * (m_pi * c²)]`\n\n**7.

This matches the values in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThe problem describes the decay of a stationary positive pion (Pi+) into a positive muon (mu+) and a neutrino (nu). We need to find the kinetic energies of the two product particles.\n\n### **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Identify the governing principles:** This is a particle decay problem, which is governed by the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum. Since the speeds of the particles can be relativistic, we must use the relativistic formulas for energy and momentum.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    *   The initial particle, the pion (Pi+), is stationary. Therefore, its initial momentum is zero (`p_initial = 0`).\n    *   According to the conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the final system must also be zero. The final system consists of the muon (mu+) and the neutrino (nu).\n    *   This means the muon and the neutrino must be emitted in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let's call this momentum magnitude `p`.\n    *   `p_mu = p_nu = p`\n\n3.  **Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n    *   The initial energy is the rest energy of the stationary pion: `E_initial = m_pi * c²`.\n    *   The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino: `E_final = E_mu + E_nu`.\n    *   Therefore: `m_pi * c² = E_mu + E_nu`.\n\n4.  **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\n    *   The relationship between a particle's total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is `E² = (pc)² + (m*c²)²`.\n    *   For the muon (mu+): `E_mu² = (pc)² + (m_mu * c²)²`.\n    *   For the neutrino (nu): Neutrinos have a very small mass and are treated as massless in this context (`m_nu = 0`). Therefore, its energy-momentum relation simplifies to `E_nu = pc`.\n\n5.  **Solving the System of Equations:**\n    *   We have a system of equations:\n        a) `m_pi * c² = E_mu + E_nu`\n        b) `E_mu² = (pc)² + (m_mu * c²)²`\n        c) `E_nu = pc`\n    *   From (c), substitute `pc` with `E_nu` in equation (b):\n        `E_mu² = E_nu² + (m_mu * c²)²`\n    *   From (a), express `E_nu` in terms of `E_mu`: `E_nu = m_pi * c² - E_mu`.\n    *   Substitute this expression for `E_nu` into the previous equation:\n        `E_mu² = (m_pi * c² - E_mu)² + (m_mu * c²)²`\n    *   Now, expand the squared term and solve for `E_mu`:\n        `E_mu² = (m_pi * c²)² - 2(m_pi * c²)E_mu + E_mu² + (m_mu * c²)²`\n    *   The `E_mu²` term on both sides cancels out:\n        `0 = (m_pi * c²)² - 2(m_pi * c²)E_mu + (m_mu * c²)²`\n    *   Rearrange to solve for `E_mu` (the total energy of the muon):\n        `2(m_pi * c²)E_mu = (m_pi * c²)² + (m_mu * c²)²`\n        `E_mu = [ (m_pi * c²)² + (m_mu * c²)² ] / [ 2 * (m_pi * c²) ]`\n\n6.  **Calculation:**\n    *   Now, we plug in the given values: `m_pi * c² = 139.6 MeV` and `m_mu * c² = 105.7 MeV`.\n    *   `E_mu = [ (139.6)² + (105.7)² ] / [ 2 * 139.6 ]`\n    *   `E_mu = [ 19488.16 + 11172.49 ] / [ 279.2 ]`\n    *   `E_mu = 30660.65 / 279.2 ≈ 109.82 MeV`\n    *   This is the total energy of the muon. The question asks for the **kinetic energy (KE)**.\n    *   `KE_mu = E_mu - (m_mu * c²) = 109.82 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 4.12 MeV`.\n\n7.  **Finding the Neutrino's Kinetic Energy:**\n    *   From the conservation of energy: `E_nu = m_pi * c² - E_mu`.\n    *   `E_nu = 139.6 MeV - 109.82 MeV = 29.78 MeV`.\n    *   Since the neutrino is considered massless, its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy.\n    *   `KE_nu = E_nu ≈ 29.8 MeV`.\n\n8.  **Final Result:**\n    *   The kinetic energy of the muon (mu+) is **4.12 MeV**.\n    *   The kinetic energy of the neutrino (nu) is **29.8 MeV**.\n    *   This pair of values corresponds to option D.\n\nThe calculation was confirmed by the Python script execution in the previous step.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThe decay of a stationary positive pion (π⁺) into a positive muon (μ⁺) and a muon neutrino (ν) is governed by the laws of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n**1.

Final State:**\n*   The products are a muon (μ⁺) and a neutrino (ν).\n*   By conservation of momentum, since the initial momentum was zero, the final total momentum must also be zero. This means the muon and neutrino must move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum (|p_μ| = |p_ν| = p).\n*   The final total energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino: E_final = E_μ + E_ν.\n\n**3. Applying Conservation Laws:**\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:**\n    m_π * c² = E_μ + E_ν\n    m_π * c² = (KE_μ + m_μ * c²) + E_ν\n\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\n    For any particle, E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n\n    *   For the muon: E_μ² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n    *   For the neutrino (assumed massless, m_ν ≈ 0): E_ν = pc. Since the neutrino's rest mass is zero, its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy, so KE_ν = pc.\n\n**4. Deriving the Kinetic Energy of the Muon (KE_μ):**\nBy combining the conservation laws and the energy-momentum relations, we can derive a formula for the kinetic energy of the heavier product particle (the muon):\n\nKE_μ = (m_π * c² - m_μ * c²)² / (2 * m_π * c²)\n\nLet's plug in the given values (working in units of MeV, where mc² is represented by m):\n*   m_π = 139.6 MeV\n*   m_μ = 105.7 MeV\n\nKE_μ = (139.6 - 105.7)² / (2 * 139.6)\nKE_μ = (33.9)² / (279.2)\nKE_μ = 1149.21 / 279.2\nKE_μ ≈ 4.12 MeV\n\n**5.

This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Principles of Conservation**\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay. Since the initial pion (Pi+) is stationary, its total energy is just its rest mass energy, `E_pi = m_pi * c^2`. After the decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon (mu+) and the neutrino (nu), `E_mu + E_nu`.\n    *   `m_pi * c^2 = E_mu + E_nu`\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after. Since the pion is stationary, the initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the final momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\n    *   `p_mu = p_nu = p` (in magnitude)\n\n**2. Relativistic Energy**\n\nThe relationship between a particle's total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is given by:\n`E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`\n\n*   For the muon: `E_mu^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n*   For the neutrino: The neutrino's rest mass is considered to be zero in this context. Therefore, its energy is entirely kinetic: `E_nu = p*c`.\n\n**3. Calculation**\n\nWe can now solve for the energies.\n\n*   Substitute `E_nu = p*c` into the energy conservation equation:\n    `m_pi * c^2 = E_mu + p*c` => `p*c = m_pi * c^2 - E_mu`\n\n*   Substitute this expression for `p*c` into the energy equation for the muon:\n    `E_mu^2 = (m_pi * c^2 - E_mu)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n    `E_mu^2 = (m_pi*c^2)^2 - 2(m_pi*c^2)E_mu + E_mu^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2`\n\n*   Simplify by canceling `E_mu^2` and solving for `E_mu`:\n    `2(m_pi*c^2)E_mu = (m_pi*c^2)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2`\n    `E_mu = [ (m_pi*c^2)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2 ] / [ 2 * m_pi*c^2 ]`\n\n*   However, it's simpler to first solve for `p*c` (which is `E_nu`), as derived in the initial reasoning step:\n    `p*c = E_nu = [ (m_pi*c^2)^2 - (m_mu*c^2)^2 ] / [ 2 * m_pi*c^2 ]`\n\n**4. Plugging in the Values**\n\nUsing the given rest mass energies:\n*   `m_pi*c^2 = 139.6` MeV\n*   `m_mu*c^2 = 105.7` MeV\n\nThe code execution performed the following calculation:\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino (KE_nu = E_nu):**\n    `E_nu = (139.6^2 - 105.7^2) / (2 * 139.6)`\n    `E_nu = (19488.16 - 11172.49) / 279.2`\n    `E_nu = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.78` MeV, which is approximately **29.8 MeV**.\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon (KE_mu):**\n    First, find the total energy of the muon using energy conservation:\n    `E_mu = m_pi*c^2 - E_nu`\n    `E_mu = 139.6 - 29.78 = 109.82` MeV\n    Then, find its kinetic energy by subtracting its rest mass energy:\n    `KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu*c^2`\n    `KE_mu = 109.82 - 105.7 = 4.12` MeV\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are **4.12 MeV** for the muon and **29.8 MeV** for the neutrino.

Principles**\nWe will use the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum. Since the speeds of the particles can be relativistic, we must use the relativistic formulas for energy and momentum.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The initial pion is at rest, so the total initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the total final momentum must also be zero. This means the muon and the neutrino fly off in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude. Let this magnitude be 'p'.\n    *   p_μ = p_ν = p\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total initial energy is the rest mass energy of the pion (m_πc²). This must equal the sum of the total energies of the final particles (muon and neutrino).\n    *   E_initial = E_final\n    *   m_πc² = E_μ + E_ν\n\n**2. Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation**\nThe total energy (E) of a particle is related to its momentum (p) and rest mass (m) by the equation:\nE² = (pc)² + (m_c²)²  or  E = √((pc)² + (m_c²)²)\n\n*   For the muon (μ⁺), which has a rest mass m_μ = 105.7 MeV/c²:\n    *   E_μ = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²)\n\n*   For the neutrino (ν), we assume it is massless (a standard approximation in such problems), so m_ν = 0:\n    *   E_ν = √((pc)² + 0) = pc\n\n**3. Solving for Momentum**\nSubstitute the expressions for E_μ and E_ν into the energy conservation equation:\nm_πc² = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²) + pc\n\nTo solve for 'pc', we rearrange and square the equation:\nm_πc² - pc = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²)\n(m_πc² - pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n(m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n\nThe (pc)² terms cancel out:\n(m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) = (m_μc²)²\n\nNow, solve for 'pc':\npc = [(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²] / [2(m_πc²)]\n\n**4.

Finding Kinetic Energies (KE)**\nKinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest mass energy (KE = E - mc²).\n\n*   **KE of the neutrino (KE_ν):**\n    Since the neutrino is treated as massless, its entire energy is kinetic.\n    KE_ν = E_ν = pc ≈ 29.78 MeV ≈ **29.8 MeV**\n\n*   **KE of the muon (KE_μ):**\n    KE_μ = E_μ - m_μc²\n    From energy conservation, we know E_μ = m_πc² - E_ν = m_πc² - pc.\n    KE_μ = (m_πc² - pc) - m_μc²\n    KE_μ = 139.6 - 29.78 - 105.7\n    KE_μ ≈ 4.12 MeV\n\nThe kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV, respectively.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThis problem involves the decay of a stationary positive pion (Pi+) into a positive muon (mu+) and a muon neutrino (nu). We need to find the kinetic energies of the two product particles.\n\nThe decay process is:\n`Pi(+) -> mu(+) + nu`\n\nHere are the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the conservation laws:** In any particle decay, both energy and momentum must be conserved.\n2.  **Set up the conservation equations:** We will use the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum to establish a system of equations.\n3.  **Solve for the energies of the products:** Using the equations and the given rest masses, we can solve for the total energies of the product particles.\n4.  **Calculate the kinetic energies:** The kinetic energy of a particle is its total energy minus its rest mass energy.\n\n### Detailed Reasoning:\n\n**Given:**\n*   Rest mass of Pi(+), `m_pi` = 139.6 MeV/c²\n*   Rest mass of mu(+), `m_mu` = 105.7 MeV/c²\n*   The initial Pi(+) is stationary.\n*   We will assume the neutrino (nu) is massless, which is a standard approximation in this type of problem. So, rest mass of nu, `m_nu` = 0.\n\n**1. Conservation of Momentum:**\n*   The initial Pi(+) is stationary, so its initial momentum is zero (`p_initial = 0`).\n*   According to the law of conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the final products must also be zero.\n*   This means the muon (mu+) and the neutrino (nu) must be emitted in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let's call this momentum magnitude `p`.\n    `|p_mu| = |p_nu| = p`\n\n**2. Conservation of Energy:**\n*   The initial energy of the stationary Pi(+) is its rest mass energy: `E_initial = m_pi * c^2`.\n*   The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon (`E_mu`) and the neutrino (`E_nu`): `E_final = E_mu + E_nu`.\n*   By conservation of energy, `E_initial = E_final`:\n    `m_pi * c^2 = E_mu + E_nu`  (Equation 1)\n\n**3.

Principles:**\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial pion (Pi+) is stationary, its momentum is zero. Therefore, the total momentum of the product particles (muon and neutrino) must also be zero. This means they fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n\n**2.

Momentum Conservation:**\n*   `p_mu` = `p_nu` (in magnitude)\n*   Let's call this momentum `p`.\n\n**5.

Solving the System:**\nWe can solve for the energies of the product particles. A key step is to rearrange the energy-momentum relation for the muon to find `(p*c)²`:\n`(p*c)² = E_mu² - (m_mu * c²)²`\n\nNow substitute `p*c = E_nu` into this equation:\n`E_nu² = E_mu² - (m_mu * c²)²`  (Equation 1)\n\nFrom the energy conservation, we have `E_mu = (m_pi * c²) - E_nu`. Substitute this into Equation 1:\n`E_nu² = [(m_pi * c²) - E_nu]² - (m_mu * c²)²`\n`E_nu² = (m_pi * c²)² - 2*(m_pi * c²)*E_nu + E_nu² - (m_mu * c²)²`\n\nThe `E_nu²` terms cancel out.

Therefore, its energy-momentum relation simplifies to `E_nu = pc`.\n\n5.  **Solving the System of Equations:**\n    *   We have a system of equations:\n        a) `m_pi * c² = E_mu + E_nu`\n        b) `E_mu² = (pc)² + (m_mu * c²)²`\n        c) `E_nu = pc`\n    *   From (c), substitute `pc` with `E_nu` in equation (b):\n        `E_mu² = E_nu² + (m_mu * c²)²`\n    *   From (a), express `E_nu` in terms of `E_mu`: `E_nu = m_pi * c² - E_mu`.\n    *   Substitute this expression for `E_nu` into the previous equation:\n        `E_mu² = (m_pi * c² - E_mu)² + (m_mu * c²)²`\n    *   Now, expand the squared term and solve for `E_mu`:\n        `E_mu² = (m_pi * c²)² - 2(m_pi * c²)E_mu + E_mu² + (m_mu * c²)²`\n    *   The `E_mu²` term on both sides cancels out:\n        `0 = (m_pi * c²)² - 2(m_pi * c²)E_mu + (m_mu * c²)²`\n    *   Rearrange to solve for `E_mu` (the total energy of the muon):\n        `2(m_pi * c²)E_mu = (m_pi * c²)² + (m_mu * c²)²`\n        `E_mu = [ (m_pi * c²)² + (m_mu * c²)² ] / [ 2 * (m_pi * c²) ]`\n\n6.  **Calculation:**\n    *   Now, we plug in the given values: `m_pi * c² = 139.6 MeV` and `m_mu * c² = 105.7 MeV`.\n    *   `E_mu = [ (139.6)² + (105.7)² ] / [ 2 * 139.6 ]`\n    *   `E_mu = [ 19488.16 + 11172.49 ] / [ 279.2 ]`\n    *   `E_mu = 30660.65 / 279.2 ≈ 109.82 MeV`\n    *   This is the total energy of the muon.

Principles of Conservation**\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay. Since the initial pion (Pi+) is stationary, its total energy is just its rest mass energy, `E_pi = m_pi * c^2`. After the decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon (mu+) and the neutrino (nu), `E_mu + E_nu`.\n    *   `m_pi * c^2 = E_mu + E_nu`\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after. Since the pion is stationary, the initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the final momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\n    *   `p_mu = p_nu = p` (in magnitude)\n\n**2. Relativistic Energy**\n\nThe relationship between a particle's total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is given by:\n`E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`\n\n*   For the muon: `E_mu^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n*   For the neutrino: The neutrino's rest mass is considered to be zero in this context. Therefore, its energy is entirely kinetic: `E_nu = p*c`.\n\n**3. Calculation**\n\nWe can now solve for the energies.\n\n*   Substitute `E_nu = p*c` into the energy conservation equation:\n    `m_pi * c^2 = E_mu + p*c` => `p*c = m_pi * c^2 - E_mu`\n\n*   Substitute this expression for `p*c` into the energy equation for the muon:\n    `E_mu^2 = (m_pi * c^2 - E_mu)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n    `E_mu^2 = (m_pi*c^2)^2 - 2(m_pi*c^2)E_mu + E_mu^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2`\n\n*   Simplify by canceling `E_mu^2` and solving for `E_mu`:\n    `2(m_pi*c^2)E_mu = (m_pi*c^2)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2`\n    `E_mu = [ (m_pi*c^2)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2 ] / [ 2 * m_pi*c^2 ]`\n\n*   However, it's simpler to first solve for `p*c` (which is `E_nu`), as derived in the initial reasoning step:\n    `p*c = E_nu = [ (m_pi*c^2)^2 - (m_mu*c^2)^2 ] / [ 2 * m_pi*c^2 ]`\n\n**4.

Principles**\nWe will use the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum. Since the speeds of the particles can be relativistic, we must use the relativistic formulas for energy and momentum.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The initial pion is at rest, so the total initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the total final momentum must also be zero. This means the muon and the neutrino fly off in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude. Let this magnitude be 'p'.\n    *   p_μ = p_ν = p\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total initial energy is the rest mass energy of the pion (m_πc²).

Solving for Momentum**\nSubstitute the expressions for E_μ and E_ν into the energy conservation equation:\nm_πc² = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²) + pc\n\nTo solve for 'pc', we rearrange and square the equation:\nm_πc² - pc = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²)\n(m_πc² - pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n(m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n\nThe (pc)² terms cancel out:\n(m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) = (m_μc²)²\n\nNow, solve for 'pc':\npc = [(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²] / [2(m_πc²)]\n\n**4.

Conservation of Momentum:**\n*   The initial Pi(+) is stationary, so its initial momentum is zero (`p_initial = 0`).\n*   According to the law of conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the final products must also be zero.\n*   This means the muon (mu+) and the neutrino (nu) must be emitted in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let's call this momentum magnitude `p`.\n    `|p_mu| = |p_nu| = p`\n\n**2. Conservation of Energy:**\n*   The initial energy of the stationary Pi(+) is its rest mass energy: `E_initial = m_pi * c^2`.\n*   The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon (`E_mu`) and the neutrino (`E_nu`): `E_final = E_mu + E_nu`.\n*   By conservation of energy, `E_initial = E_final`:\n    `m_pi * c^2 = E_mu + E_nu`  (Equation 1)\n\n**3.
