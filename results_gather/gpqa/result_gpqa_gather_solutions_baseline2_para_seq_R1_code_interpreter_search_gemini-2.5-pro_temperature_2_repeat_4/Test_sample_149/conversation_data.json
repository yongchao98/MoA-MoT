KOH, Heat.**\n    *   We are now reacting an aldehyde that has acidic α-protons (the protons on the -CH2- group) with a strong base (KOH) and heat. This is a classic **aldol condensation** reaction.\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH-) removes an α-proton from one molecule to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate then attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule. This results in an aldol addition product.\n        *   Product of addition: **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option A).\n    *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The \"Heat\" in the reaction conditions strongly favors the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product.

The starting material is 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal.\n2.  Diazotization followed by hydrolysis converts the amino group to a hydroxyl group, yielding 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal.\n3.  Base-catalyzed self-condensation with heat leads to the formation of an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, which is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\n*   **Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material from its molecular formula and NMR data.**\n\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula for DBE is C - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 + 1.\n        DBE = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n        A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one ring and three double bonds). This leaves one additional degree of unsaturation, which is likely a carbonyl group (C=O) given the oxygen atom and the NMR data.\n\n    *   **1H-NMR Analysis:**\n        *   **δ 9.72 (t, 1H):** The chemical shift is in the characteristic region for an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern is a triplet (t), which means it is coupled to two adjacent protons (n+1 rule, n=2), indicating a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n        *   **δ 6.98 (d, 2H) and δ 6.51 (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region (6.5-8.0 ppm) are characteristic of a para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. Each signal is a doublet representing two equivalent protons.\n        *   **δ 6.27 (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet (bs) for two protons is typical for the protons of a primary amine (-NH2). The broadening is due to hydrogen exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom.\n        *   **δ 3.66 (d, 2H):** This signal for two protons is a doublet (d), meaning it's coupled to one adjacent proton (n=1). This corresponds to the -CH2- group, which is coupled to the single aldehyde proton. The chemical shift is appropriate for a benzylic methylene group adjacent to a carbonyl.\n\n    *   **Assembling the Structure:**\n        We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The substituents are an amino group (-NH2) and an acetaldehyde group (-CH2CHO).\n        The structure is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. Let's verify the formula: C6H4 (ring) + NH2 + C2H3O (side chain) = C8H9NO. This matches.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\n    *   **Starting Material:** 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde.\n\n    *   **Reagent 1: NaNO2 + HCl (Diazotization)**\n        This set of reagents converts a primary aromatic amine into a diazonium salt. The -NH2 group on the benzene ring is converted to -N2+Cl-.\n        The intermediate is **4-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride**.\n\n    *   **Reagent 2: H2O (Hydrolysis)**\n        Adding water and warming the diazonium salt solution causes the diazonium group (-N2+) to be replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH), releasing nitrogen gas (N2).\n        The product of this step is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n    *   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation)**\n        4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde is an aldehyde with acidic α-protons (the protons on the -CH2- group). In the presence of a strong base (KOH) and heat, it will undergo a self-aldol condensation.\n\n        1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH removes an α-proton from one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n        2.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n        3.  **Protonation:** The resulting alkoxide is protonated to form an aldol addition product: **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This is option A).\n        4.  **Dehydration:** The condition \"Heat\" indicates that the reaction proceeds further. The aldol addition product undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to form a more stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The hydroxyl group on carbon 3 and the acidic proton on carbon 2 are eliminated.\n\n        The final product is the aldol condensation product: **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Match the final product with the given options.**\n\n    *   The structure of the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n    *   Let's check the options:\n        A) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal - This is the intermediate aldol addition product, formed before dehydration. The \"Heat\" condition makes this unlikely to be the final product.\n        B) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal - Incorrect structure. The phenyl groups should have hydroxyl substituents, and the double bond position is wrong.\n        C) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal - Incorrect structure. This would result from a different reaction, not a self-condensation of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n        D) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal - This name correctly describes the final α,β-unsaturated aldehyde formed from the self-condensation and dehydration of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product:\n\n**1. Identification of the Starting Material**\n\nFirst, we need to deduce the structure of the initial compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO from its 1H-NMR data.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO.\n    *   The degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 9 - 4 = 5. A DoU of 4 is typical for a benzene ring, and the remaining 1 corresponds to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **1H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) splitting indicates it is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-), according to the n+1 rule (1 proton sees 2 adjacent protons, 2+1=3, a triplet).\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly suggest a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is characteristic of an amino group (-NH2). The broadness is due to rapid proton exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-). The doublet (d) splitting means it is adjacent to a single proton (-CH-), which is consistent with it being coupled to the aldehyde proton (-CHO).\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   The substituents are an amino group (-NH2) and an acetaldehyde group (-CH2CHO).\n    *   Let's check if the structure, 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal (or 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde), matches the molecular formula C8H9NO.\n        *   Benzene ring (C6H4) + Amino group (NH2) + Acetaldehyde group (C2H3O) = C8H(4+2+3)NO = C8H9NO.\n    *   The structure is consistent with all the data.\n\n    The starting material is:\n    ```\n        O=CH-CH2-Ph-NH2 (para-substituted)\n    ```\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\nNow, we trace the starting material through the given series of reactions.\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO2 + HCl**\n    *   These reagents are used for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The reaction is typically carried out at low temperatures (0-5 °C).\n    *   The primary amino group (-NH2) on the benzene ring is converted into a diazonium salt group (-N2+Cl-).\n    *   The product of this step is 2-(4-diazoniumphenyl)ethanal chloride.\n\n*   **Step 2: H2O**\n    *   Adding water to the diazonium salt solution and warming it up results in the substitution of the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group (-OH). This is a standard method to synthesize phenols from anilines.\n    *   The product of this step is 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal (or 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde).\n    ```\n        O=CH-CH2-Ph-OH (para-substituted)\n    ```\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   This step involves reacting the product from step 2, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, with a strong base (KOH) and heat.\n    *   4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde is an aldehyde that has protons on the carbon alpha to the carbonyl group (the -CH2- protons).\n    *   Aldehydes with α-hydrogens undergo a base-catalyzed aldol condensation. Since there is only one type of aldehyde, this will be a self-condensation.\n    *   The reaction proceeds in two stages:\n        1.  **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH-) removes an α-proton from one aldehyde molecule to form an enolate ion. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second aldehyde molecule. Protonation of the resulting alkoxide yields an aldol addition product, which is a β-hydroxy aldehyde.\n            The structure of the aldol addition product is 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal. This corresponds to option (C).\n        2.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction mixture is heated. Heat promotes the elimination of a water molecule (dehydration) from the aldol addition product. The α-proton and the β-hydroxyl group are removed, forming a double bond between the α and β carbons. This results in an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n            The formation of the conjugated system (C=C double bond conjugated with both a phenyl ring and the carbonyl group) makes this dehydration step thermodynamically favorable.\n\n    Let's determine the structure of the final condensation product:\n    *   Aldol addition product: `(HO-Ph)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(Ph-OH)-CHO`\n    *   Dehydration removes the -OH from C3 and an -H from C2:\n    *   Final Product: `(HO-Ph)-CH2-CH=C(Ph-OH)-CHO`\n    *   The systematic name for this structure is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**3. Matching the Product with Options**\n\n*   The final product derived from the reaction sequence is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n*   Comparing this with the given options:\n    *   A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect structure and lacks hydroxyl groups.\n    *   B) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: This perfectly matches our derived final product.\n    *   C) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the intermediate aldol addition product, not the final product under heating conditions.\n    *   D) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect structure.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the reaction sequence is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material from its molecular formula and NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    DBE = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 9 - 4 = 5.\n    A DBE of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (4 DBE) and one additional double bond or ring (1 DBE), which is consistent with a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) indicates it's adjacent to a CH₂ group (n+1 rule, 2+1=3 peaks). So, we have a -CH₂-CHO fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This corresponds to the CH₂ group adjacent to the aldehyde. The doublet (d) is due to coupling with the single aldehyde proton (1+1=2 peaks). This confirms the -CH₂-CHO fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, both doublets with an integration of 2H, are classic for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for 2 protons in this region is typical for a primary amine (-NH₂).\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    We have three fragments:\n    1.  A para-substituted benzene ring (C₆H₄)\n    2.  An ethyl-aldehyde group (-CH₂CHO)\n    3.  An amino group (-NH₂)\n\n    Connecting these fragments gives the structure 2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde. The -NH₂ and -CH₂CHO groups are at positions 1 and 4 of the benzene ring. The chemical shifts support this: the electron-donating -NH₂ group shields its ortho protons (making them appear at a lower ppm, 6.51 ppm), while the protons ortho to the -CH₂CHO group are less shielded (higher ppm, 6.98 ppm).\n\n    **Starting Material (A):** 2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde.\n     \n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\n*   **Reaction 1 & 2: NaNO₂ + HCl, followed by H₂O.**\n    1.  **NaNO₂ + HCl (0-5 °C):** These are the reagents for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The -NH₂ group is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻).\n    2.  **H₂O (often with gentle warming):** The diazonium salt is unstable and reacts with water to replace the -N₂⁺ group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group, releasing nitrogen gas (N₂). This is a standard synthesis of phenols from anilines.\n\n    The product after these two steps is **2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde (B)**.\n     \n\n*   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat.**\n    *   The reagent is a strong base (KOH) with heat, and the substrate is an aldehyde (2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde) with acidic α-protons (the protons on the carbon adjacent to the C=O group). These are the classic conditions for an **aldol condensation** reaction.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) from KOH removes an acidic α-proton from one molecule of the aldehyde to form an enolate ion.\n        2.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The nucleophilic enolate ion attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second aldehyde molecule. This forms an aldol addition product (an alkoxide).\n        3.  **Protonation:** The alkoxide is protonated by water to give the aldol addition product, **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal (C)**. This corresponds to option (B).\n        4.  **Dehydration:** The condition \"Heat\" strongly favors the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. The hydroxyl group at C-3 and the acidic proton at C-2 are removed, forming a double bond between C-2 and C-3. This dehydration step is called condensation. The product is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, which is stabilized by conjugation between the new C=C double bond, the C=O group, and one of the phenyl rings.\n\n    **Final Product (D):** The final product is the result of this dehydration.\n    The structure is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n     \n\n**Step 3: Match the final product with the given options.**\n\n*   A) **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal:** This name perfectly matches the structure of our derived final product from the aldol condensation.\n*   B) **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal:** This is the intermediate aldol addition product, which would dehydrate upon heating.\n*   C) **2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal:** This molecule lacks the hydroxyl groups on the phenyl rings.\n*   D) **4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal:** This molecule is not a dimer; it results from a different reaction pathway.\n\nGiven the reaction conditions, especially the application of heat, the condensation product is the expected final product.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the structure of the starting material from its molecular formula and NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula for DBE is C - H/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    DBE = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBE) and one additional degree of unsaturation (a C=C or C=O double bond, or another ring).\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern, a triplet (t), indicates it is adjacent to a carbon with 2 protons (a CH2 group), according to the n+1 rule. This suggests a `-CH2-CHO` fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to 2 protons. Its chemical shift is typical for protons on a carbon adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (like an aldehyde or an aromatic ring). The splitting, a doublet (d), indicates it's adjacent to a carbon with 1 proton (a CH group). This is consistent with the aldehyde proton, confirming the `-CH2-CHO` fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. They are both doublets, each integrating to 2 protons. This symmetrical pattern is a classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is characteristic of a primary amine (-NH2) group attached to an aromatic ring (an aniline derivative). The broadness is due to fast proton exchange and nitrogen's quadrupole moment.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    Based on the fragments identified, we have a para-disubstituted benzene ring. One substituent is the amino group (-NH2), and the other is the 2-oxoethyl group (-CH2-CHO).\n    The structure is 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal (also known as p-aminophenylacetaldehyde).\n    Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4 (ring) + NH2 + CH2 + CHO = C8H(4+2+2+1)NO = C8H9NO. The structure matches the given formula and all NMR data.\n    Starting Material:\n     ![Starting Material: 2-(4-aminophenyl) ethanal](https://i.imgur.com/8Qh1e4h.png)\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\nThe starting material, 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: NaNO2 + HCl**\n    This is the standard procedure for the **diazotization** of a primary aromatic amine. The -NH2 group is converted into a diazonium salt group (-N2+Cl-).\n    The product after this step is 2-(4-diazoniumphenyl)ethanal chloride.\n     \n\n*   **Reaction 2: H2O**\n    The diazonium salt is then treated with water. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group and is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group via a substitution reaction (hydrolysis), releasing nitrogen gas (N2). This reaction forms a phenol.\n    The product after this step is 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal (also known as p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde).\n     ![Phenol Intermediate: 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) ethanal](https://i.imgur.com/i9oF2vR.png)\n\n*   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    The intermediate, 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal, is an aldehyde that possesses alpha-protons (the protons on the -CH2- group). When treated with a strong base (KOH) and heat, it undergoes a self-**aldol condensation**.\n    1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH removes an acidic alpha-proton to form a resonance-stabilized enolate.\n    2.  **Aldol Addition:** The enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of the aldehyde. This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is the aldol addition product.\n        The structure of this addition product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option C).\n         \n    3.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction condition specifies \"Heat\". Heating the aldol addition product causes the elimination of a molecule of water (dehydration). The hydroxyl group from the β-carbon (C3) and a proton from the α-carbon (C2) are removed. This forms an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. This dehydration is highly favorable because the resulting double bond is in conjugation with both the aldehyde's carbonyl group and the aromatic ring on C2, creating a very stable, extended conjugated system.\n        The final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n         \n\n**Step 3: Match the final product with the given options.**\n\n*   A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect substituents (phenyl instead of hydroxyphenyl) and wrong double bond position.\n*   B) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect structure; only has one hydroxyphenyl group.\n*   C) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the aldol addition intermediate, not the final product under heating conditions.\n*   D) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: This is the final, dehydrated aldol condensation product. This structure matches our derived final product.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the reaction sequence is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\n*   **Step 1: Determine the structure of the initial compound (C8H9NO) from the NMR data.**\n\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula for DBE is C - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 + 1.\n        DBE = 8 - (9/2) - (0/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n        A DBE of 5 is characteristic of a benzene ring (4 DBE) plus one additional degree of unsaturation (e.g., a C=O double bond).\n\n    *   **Analyze the 1H-NMR spectrum:**\n        *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly indicative of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet multiplicity (t) means it is coupled to two adjacent protons (n+1 rule, n=2), suggesting a -CH2-CHO group.\n        *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the methylene protons (-CH2-) adjacent to the aldehyde. The doublet multiplicity (d) confirms it is coupled to the single aldehyde proton (n=1). This confirms the presence of an acetaldehyde moiety (-CH2CHO).\n        *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons and appearing as doublets, strongly suggest a para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring.\n        *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) for 2 protons is characteristic of an amine group (-NH2). The protons are exchangeable, leading to broadening.\n\n    *   **Assemble the structure:** We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring, with an -NH2 group and a -CH2CHO group as substituents. The formula for C6H4(NH2)(CH2CHO) is C6+1+1 H4+2+2+1 N O = C8H9NO.

In the presence of a base (KOH) and heat, it will undergo a self-aldol condensation.\n\n        1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH removes an α-proton from one molecule to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n        2.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n        3.  **Protonation:** An acid-base reaction with water yields the aldol addition product, a β-hydroxy aldehyde: 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal.\n        4.  **Dehydration:** Because the reaction is heated, the aldol addition product readily dehydrates by eliminating a molecule of water to form a more stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.

A benzene ring accounts for 4 DBEs, and a carbonyl group (C=O) accounts for 1 DBE, which totals 5. This suggests the presence of both a benzene ring and a carbonyl group.\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern, a triplet (t), indicates it is adjacent to a CH₂ group (n+1 rule, 2+1=3 peaks).\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a CH₂ group. Its chemical shift suggests it's adjacent to both an electron-withdrawing group (the aldehyde) and an aromatic ring. The splitting pattern, a doublet (d), confirms it is coupled to the single aldehyde proton (1+1=2 peaks). This confirms the presence of a **-CH₂-CHO** (acetaldehyde) fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, are classic signals for a para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons in this region is indicative of a primary amine group (-NH₂) attached to an aromatic ring. The protons are exchangeable, which often results in a broad signal. The upfield shift of one of the aromatic doublets (6.51 ppm) is consistent with the strong electron-donating effect of an -NH₂ group.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   The substituents are an amine group (-NH₂) and an acetaldehyde group (-CH₂CHO).\n    *   The structure is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. Let's verify the molecular formula: C₆H₄ (ring) + C₂H₃O (acetaldehyde group) + NH₂ = **C₈H₉NO**. This matches the given formula.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: NaNO₂ + HCl (at low temperature, typically 0-5 °C)**\n    *   This is the **diazotization** reaction. A primary aromatic amine (Ar-NH₂) reacts with nitrous acid (HONO, formed in situ from NaNO₂ and HCl) to form an aromatic diazonium salt (Ar-N₂⁺Cl⁻).\n    *   The product of this step is **p-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride** ([N₂⁺]-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO).\n\n*   **Reaction 2: H₂O, Heat**\n    *   Aromatic diazonium salts are generally unstable and react with water upon warming to replace the diazonium group (-N₂⁺) with a hydroxyl group (-OH). Nitrogen gas (N₂) is evolved as a byproduct.\n    *   The product of this step is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde** (HO-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO).\n\n*   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   The product from the previous step, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, is an aldehyde that has acidic alpha-protons (the protons on the -CH₂- group).\n    *   KOH is a strong base, and heat is applied. These are the classic conditions for a **base-catalyzed self-aldol condensation**.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  **Addition:** The base (OH⁻) removes an alpha-proton from one molecule of the aldehyde to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second aldehyde molecule. After protonation of the resulting alkoxide, an aldol addition product is formed.\n            *   Intermediate Product (Aldol Adduct): **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This corresponds to option (D).\n        2.  **Condensation (Dehydration):** Because the reaction is heated, the aldol addition product readily undergoes dehydration (elimination of a water molecule). The base removes the acidic alpha-proton (at C2), and the hydroxyl group from the beta-carbon (C3) leaves. This forms a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The stability is enhanced because the new C=C double bond is in conjugation with both the aldehyde's C=O group and one of the aromatic rings.\n            *   Final Product (Condensation Product): The double bond forms between C2 and C3, resulting in **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Final Product.**\n\nThe question asks for the final product. Given the condition \"Heat\", the reaction will not stop at the aldol addition stage (D). The elimination of water is thermodynamically favorable due to the formation of a highly conjugated system.

The doublet (d) splitting indicates it is coupled to a single adjacent proton (a doublet means 1 adjacent proton). This corresponds to the aldehyde proton. So, we have confirmed the presence of a `-CH2-CHO` group.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The presence of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The chemical shifts are relatively upfield (benzene is ~7.3 ppm), which suggests the ring is substituted with an electron-donating group.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet for 2 protons is characteristic of a primary amine (-NH2) group attached to an aromatic ring. The nitrogen in the molecular formula and the electron-donating nature required to explain the upfield aromatic shifts confirm this assignment.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    Based on the fragments identified (-CHO, -CH2-, 1,4-disubstituted benzene, -NH2), the starting compound is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n    *   Formula check: C6H4 (ring) + NH2 + CH2 + CHO = C8H9NO.

This is favored because it results in an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, where the new C=C double bond is conjugated with the C=O of the aldehyde group, as well as one of the phenyl rings.\n\n        The structure of the final dehydrated product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n        ```\n              OH         O         OH                   OH          O         OH\n              |         ||         |                   |          ||         |\n        C6H4-CH2-CH-CH(C6H4)-CHO   --(Heat, -H2O)-->   C6H4-CH2-CH=C(C6H4)-CHO\n           (Aldol Adduct - Option B)                 (Aldol Condensation Product - Option A)\n        ```\n\n**Step 3: Match the final product with the given options.**\n\n*   The final product derived from the reaction sequence is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n*   This matches option A.\n*   Option B is the intermediate aldol adduct, which is not the final product under heating conditions.\n*   Options C and D have incorrect structures/functional groups.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\n*   **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material from the molecular formula C8H9NO and 1H-NMR data.**\n\n1.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    The formula for DoU is C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2), where C is the number of carbons, H is hydrogens, X is halogens, and N is nitrogens.\n    DoU = 8 + 1 - (9/2) - (0/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond or ring.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H-NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **δ 9.72 (t, 1H):** The chemical shift (> 9 ppm) is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The multiplicity is a triplet (t), which means it is coupled to two adjacent equivalent protons (n+1 rule, 2+1=3). This points to a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **δ 3.66 (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the -CH2- group adjacent to the aldehyde. It's a doublet (d) because it's coupled to the single aldehyde proton (1+1=2). This confirms the **-CH2-CHO** (acetaldehyde) group. This group also contains a C=O double bond, which accounts for the final degree of unsaturation.\n    *   **δ 6.98 (d, 2H) and δ 6.51 (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region (6.5-8.0 ppm), both doublets and integrating to 2 protons each, are a classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **δ 6.27 (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is typical for an amino group (**-NH2**) attached to the aromatic ring. The protons are exchangeable, leading to a broad signal.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Structure:**\n    We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring with an -NH2 group and a -CH2-CHO group as substituents.\n    The structure is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n    Let's verify the molecular formula:\n    C6H4 (from the ring) + C2H3O (from -CH2CHO) + NH2 = C8H(4+3+2)NO = **C8H9NO**. The formula matches.\n    So, the starting material is correctly identified as 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\n1.  **Reagents 1 & 2: NaNO2 + HCl, then H2O**\n    *   The first step (NaNO2, HCl, typically at 0-5 °C) is the **diazotization** of a primary aromatic amine. The -NH2 group on the benzene ring is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n    *   The intermediate is 4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n    *   The second step (addition of H2O, usually with gentle warming) is the **hydrolysis** of the diazonium salt. The -N2+ group is an excellent leaving group (it leaves as N2 gas) and is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group from water. This is a variation of the Sandmeyer reaction.\n    *   The product after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n    *   Structure: HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO\n\n2.  **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   This is a strong base (KOH) with heat applied to 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n    *   This molecule has an aldehyde group and acidic α-protons (the protons on the -CH2- group). These are the classic conditions for an **Aldol Condensation**. The \"condensation\" part implies that an initial aldol addition is followed by a dehydration reaction, which is driven by the applied heat.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        a.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH removes an acidic α-proton from one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form a resonance-stabilized enolate.\n        b.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate anion acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n        c.  **Aldol Addition Product:** After protonation of the resulting alkoxide, the aldol addition product is formed. Its systematic name is 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal (This corresponds to option A).\n        d.  **Dehydration:** With heating, this aldol adduct readily loses a molecule of water (dehydration). The -OH group from carbon-3 is eliminated along with an α-proton from the adjacent carbon-2.\n        *   Eliminating the H from C2 is highly favored because it creates a double bond between C2 and C3, resulting in an **α,β-unsaturated aldehyde**. This product is thermodynamically very stable because the new C=C double bond is in conjugation with both the aldehyde's C=O group and the phenyl ring at C2.\n        *   The resulting final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the options against the final product.**\n\n*   A) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the aldol *addition* product, an intermediate before the dehydration step caused by heat.\n*   B) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect structure. This product would result from a different reaction and only contains one of the original monomer units.\n*   C) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect structure. It lacks the hydroxyl groups that are introduced in the second step of the reaction sequence.\n*   D) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: This is the final, stable product of the aldol condensation (addition followed by dehydration) of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. The structure matches our derived product.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\n*   **Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material from the molecular formula (C8H9NO) and 1H-NMR data.**\n\n    1.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n        DoU = C + 1 + N/2 - H/2 = 8 + 1 + 1/2 - 9/2 = 9.5 - 4.5 = 5.\n        A DoU of 5 suggests a benzene ring (DoU = 4) and one additional degree of unsaturation (a C=C or C=O bond).\n\n    2.  **Analyze the 1H-NMR Spectrum:**\n        *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This high chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern, a triplet (t), indicates that it is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-), as per the n+1 rule (2+1=3). This confirms a **-CH2-CHO** fragment.\n        *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to the aldehyde. Its chemical shift is consistent with being attached to both an aromatic ring and the electron-withdrawing aldehyde group. The splitting pattern, a doublet (d), confirms it is coupled to the single aldehyde proton (1+1=2). This further supports the **-CH2-CHO** fragment.\n        *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, both doublets integrating to 2 protons each, are classic indicators of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n        *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet that integrates to 2 protons is typical for exchangeable protons like those in an amino (-NH2) or hydroxyl (-OH) group. Given the presence of nitrogen in the molecular formula, this signal is assigned to a primary **amino group (-NH2)**.\n\n    3.  **Assemble the Structure:**\n        The fragments are a para-substituted benzene ring, a -CH2-CHO group, and an -NH2 group. Assembling these gives **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n        Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4 (from the ring) + C2H3O (from -CH2CHO) + NH2 = C8H9NO. The formula matches.\n        The structure of the starting material is 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the sequence of reactions.**\n\n    1.  **Reagents: 1. NaNO2 + HCl; 2. H2O**\n        *   This is a two-step process. The first step (NaNO2 + HCl, typically at 0-5 °C) is the **diazotization** of the primary aromatic amine. The -NH2 group is converted into a diazonium salt group (-N2+Cl-).\n        *   The second step (H2O, with warming) is the **hydrolysis** of the diazonium salt. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group (it leaves as N2 gas) and is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH) from water.\n        *   The net result of these two steps is the conversion of the primary aromatic amine into a phenol.\n        *   The intermediate product formed after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n        *   Structure: HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO\n\n    2.  **Reagent: 3. aq. KOH, Heat**\n        *   The intermediate, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, possesses both an aldehyde group and acidic α-protons (on the -CH2- group adjacent to the carbonyl).\n        *   These are the conditions for a **self-aldol condensation** reaction. A strong base (KOH) deprotonates the α-carbon of one molecule to form an enolate nucleophile. This enolate then attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule.\n        *   **Aldol Addition:** The initial product is the β-hydroxy aldehyde, called the aldol adduct.\n            *   Molecule 1 (enolate): [HO-C6H4-CH-CHO]⁻\n            *   Molecule 2 (aldehyde): HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO\n            *   Attack and protonation yield the aldol adduct: 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal. This corresponds to option (D).\n        *   **Aldol Condensation (Dehydration):** The reaction is carried out with **heat**. Heating an aldol addition product in the presence of base (or acid) causes dehydration (elimination of a water molecule) to form an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. This product is thermodynamically more stable due to the extended conjugation between the double bond and the carbonyl group.\n            *   Aldol Adduct: HO-Ph-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(Ph-OH)-CHO\n            *   The hydroxyl group is on the β-carbon (C-3), and an acidic proton is on the α-carbon (C-2).\n            *   Elimination of H2O (the -OH from C-3 and the -H from C-2) forms a double bond between C-2 and C-3.\n            *   Final Product: HO-Ph-CH2-CH=C(Ph-OH)-CHO\n        *   **Naming the final product:**\n            *   The main chain is a butenal (4 carbons, aldehyde at C-1, double bond at C-2). So, `but-2-enal`.\n            *   There is a (4-hydroxyphenyl) group at C-2 and another (4-hydroxyphenyl) group at C-4.\n            *   The IUPAC name is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This matches option (A).\n\n*   **Step 3: Conclusion**\n    Since the reaction is heated, the final isolated product is the result of condensation (dehydration), not just addition.

This leaves 1 DBE, which corresponds to a carbonyl group (C=O) or a C=C double bond.\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   `9.72 ppm (t, 1H)`: This chemical shift and multiplicity (triplet) is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO) that is adjacent to a CH2 group (n+1=3, so n=2). This confirms the presence of a `-CH2-CHO` fragment and the C=O group.\n    *   `6.98 ppm (d, 2H)` and `6.51 ppm (d, 2H)`: Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, strongly indicate a *para*-substituted benzene ring. The relatively upfield shifts suggest the ring is substituted with electron-donating groups.\n    *   `6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)`: A broad singlet for two protons is typical for a primary amine (-NH2) group. An amine is an electron-donating group, consistent with the aromatic signals.\n    *   `3.66 ppm (d, 2H)`: A doublet for two protons, which corresponds to the -CH2- group coupled to the aldehyde proton (-CHO), as established from the aldehyde signal.\n\n*   **Assembling the structure:**\n    Putting all the pieces together (a *para*-substituted benzene ring, an -NH2 group, and a -CH2CHO group), the starting compound is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. The formula C8H9NO matches this structure (C6H4 for the ring, NH2, and C2H3O for the side chain).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the sequence of reactions.**\n\nThe starting material is 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: NaNO2 + HCl (diazotization)**\n    This reaction converts the primary aromatic amine (-NH2) into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n    The product is **4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride**.\n    \n    `H2N-C6H4-CH2CHO  -- (NaNO2, HCl) -->  Cl-N2+-C6H4-CH2CHO`\n\n*   **Reaction 2: H2O (hydrolysis)**\n    Warming the aqueous solution of the diazonium salt causes the -N2+ group to be replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group, releasing N2 gas.\n    The product is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n    \n    `Cl-N2+-C6H4-CH2CHO  -- (H2O, Heat) -->  HO-C6H4-CH2CHO + N2 + HCl`\n\n*   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation)**\n    The reactant for this step is 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This molecule has both an aldehyde functional group and acidic α-hydrogens (the protons on the -CH2- group). In the presence of a strong base (KOH) and heat, it will undergo a self-aldol condensation.\n\n    *   **Step a: Aldol Addition:** The base (OH-) removes an α-proton to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. Protonation of the resulting alkoxide yields a β-hydroxy aldehyde, known as the aldol adduct.\n        \n        Aldol Adduct: **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This corresponds to **Option D**.\n        \n        `2 * HO-C6H4-CH2CHO --(KOH)--> HO-C6H4-CH(CHO)-CH(OH)-CH2-C6H4-OH`\n\n    *   **Step b: Dehydration:** The reaction is performed with \"Heat\". In aldol reactions, heating the aldol adduct in the presence of base causes dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to form an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. This is because the resulting conjugated system is thermodynamically very stable. The α-proton is removed, and the β-hydroxyl group is eliminated.\n        \n        `HO-C6H4-CH(CHO)-CH(OH)-CH2-C6H4-OH --(Heat, -H2O)--> HO-C6H4-C(CHO)=CH-CH2-C6H4-OH`\n\n        Final Product: The resulting α,β-unsaturated aldehyde is named **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This corresponds to **Option B**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe reaction proceeds through the aldol adduct (D), but because heat is applied, the final, stable product is the dehydrated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde (B). Therefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n**1.

These are the classic conditions for an **aldol condensation** reaction.\n    *   **Aldol Addition:**\n        1.  The base (OH-) removes an acidic alpha-proton from one molecule of the aldehyde (the protons on the -CH2- group) to form an enolate.\n        2.  This enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second aldehyde molecule.\n        3.  After protonation, this forms an aldol addition product: **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This corresponds to option (C).\n    *   **Aldol Condensation (Dehydration):**\n        The \"Heat\" in the reaction conditions promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol adduct. The alpha-proton (on C2) and the beta-hydroxyl group (on C3) are eliminated to form a stable, conjugated C=C double bond. This process is called condensation.\n        *   Aldol Adduct: `(HO)Ph-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(PhOH)-CHO`\n        *   Dehydration removes the H from C2 and the OH from C3.\n        *   Final Product: `(HO)Ph-CH2-CH=C(PhOH)-CHO`\n\n*   **Identify the Final Product:**\n    *   The name of the condensation product `(HO)Ph-CH2-CH=C(PhOH)-CHO` is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n    *   This matches option **A**.\n    *   Option (C) is the intermediate aldol adduct, but the inclusion of \"Heat\" indicates the reaction proceeds to the final condensation product.\n    *   Option (B) has an incorrect molecular formula.\n    *   Option (D) incorrectly has phenyl groups instead of the hydroxyphenyl groups that are formed in the second step of the reaction.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the entire reaction sequence is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n**1.

This signal is broad due to quadrupole relaxation of the nitrogen nucleus and its protons often exchange with trace amounts of water or D₂O.\n\n*   **Putting it all together:** We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring with two substituents: an amino group (-NH₂) and an acetaldehyde group (-CH₂CHO).\n    The structure is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n    Let's check the molecular formula: C₆H₄ (ring) + CH₂CHO (side chain) + NH₂ (substituent) = C₈H(4+2+1+2)NO = C₈H₉NO. The formula matches.\n\n    **Starting Material:**\n    ```\n       H₂N-Ph-CH₂-CHO (para-substitution)\n    ```\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **Step 1 & 2: 1. NaNO₂ + HCl; 2. H₂O, Heat**\n    *   The first reagent (NaNO₂ + HCl, typically at 0-5°C) is used for the **diazotization** of a primary aromatic amine. The -NH₂ group is converted into a diazonium salt, -N₂⁺Cl⁻.\n        *   Intermediate 1: 4-(diazonium chloride)phenylacetaldehyde `[Cl⁻N₂⁺-Ph-CH₂-CHO]`\n    *   The second step (H₂O, Heat) is the hydrolysis of the aryl diazonium salt to form a phenol. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group (it leaves as N₂ gas), and it is replaced by an -OH group from water.\n        *   Intermediate 2: **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde** `[HO-Ph-CH₂-CHO]`\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   The reagent is a strong base (KOH) with heat. The reactant is 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, which has an aldehyde group and acidic alpha-protons on the -CH₂- group.\n    *   These are the classic conditions for an **Aldol Condensation**. It is a self-condensation because only one type of aldehyde is present.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  **Enolate formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) from KOH deprotonates the acidic α-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the C=O group) to form an enolate ion.\n            `HO-Ph-CH₂-CHO + OH⁻ ⇌ [HO-Ph-CH-CHO]⁻ + H₂O` (Enolate)\n        2.  **Aldol Addition:** The enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of another molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n            `[HO-Ph-CH-CHO]⁻ + HO-Ph-CH₂-CHO → HO-Ph-CH₂(CH-O⁻)-CH(CHO)-Ph-OH`\n        3.  **Protonation:** The resulting alkoxide is protonated by water to form a β-hydroxy aldehyde, the aldol addition product.\n            `HO-Ph-CH₂(CH-O⁻)-CH(CHO)-Ph-OH + H₂O → HO-Ph-CH₂(CH-OH)-CH(CHO)-Ph-OH + OH⁻`\n            The structure of this addition product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This corresponds to **Option D**.\n\n        4.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of \"Heat\" in the reaction conditions promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. The -OH group from the β-carbon (C3) and a proton from the α-carbon (C2) are eliminated. This is favored because the resulting C=C double bond is conjugated with both the aldehyde's C=O group and one of the phenyl rings, creating a very stable α,β-unsaturated system.\n            `HO-Ph-CH₂(C³H-OH)-(C²H)(CHO)-Ph-OH  --Heat--> HO-Ph-CH₂-C³H=C²(CHO)-Ph-OH + H₂O`\n\n*   **Identifying the Final Product:**\n    *   The aldol addition product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option D).\n    *   The final condensation product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal** (Option B).\n    *   Since the reaction is carried out with heat, the reaction proceeds to completion to form the more stable condensation product.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n**Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **Given:** Molecular formula (C8H9NO), 1H-NMR data, and a three-step reaction sequence.\n    *   **Goal:** Identify the final product from the given options.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Identify the Starting Compound (C8H9NO) using NMR data.**\n    *   **Calculate Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n        *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) - (X/2)\n        *   DoU = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n        *   A benzene ring accounts for 4 DoU. The remaining 1 DoU suggests a C=O or C=C double bond.\n\n    *   **Analyze the 1H-NMR Spectrum:**\n        *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This high chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern, a triplet (t), means it's adjacent to a CH2 group (n+1 rule, 2+1=3 peaks). So we have a `-CH2-CHO` fragment.\n        *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets integrating to 2H each strongly indicate a para-disubstituted (1,4-substituted) benzene ring.\n        *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) for 2 protons in this region is typical for an amino group (-NH2), where protons can exchange.\n        *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This is a methylene (-CH2-) group. The splitting, a doublet (d), means it's adjacent to a single CH proton (n+1 rule, 1+1=2 peaks). This fits perfectly with the `-CH2-CHO` fragment identified from the aldehyde signal. The chemical shift around 3.66 ppm is also consistent with a benzylic CH2 group adjacent to an electron-withdrawing carbonyl group.\n\n    *   **Assemble the Structure:**\n        *   We have the following fragments: a para-disubstituted benzene ring (C6H4), an amino group (-NH2), and an acetaldehyde side chain (-CH2CHO).\n        *   Let's put them together: The two substituents on the para-disubstituted ring must be -NH2 and -CH2CHO.\n        *   Proposed Structure: **4-(aminophenyl)acetaldehyde** (also known as p-(2-oxoethyl)aniline).\n        *   Let's check the molecular formula: The structure is `H2N-C6H4-CH2CHO`.\n            *   Carbons: 6 (ring) + 1 (CH2) + 1 (CHO) = 8\n            *   Hydrogens: 2 (NH2) + 4 (ring) + 2 (CH2) + 1 (CHO) = 9\n            *   Nitrogen: 1\n            *   Oxygen: 1\n            *   Formula: C8H9NO. This matches perfectly.\n        *   The NMR data is fully consistent with this structure.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Analyze the Reaction Sequence.**\n    *   **Starting Material:** 4-(aminophenyl)acetaldehyde.\n    *   **Reagent 1: NaNO2 + HCl (at low temperature, implied).** This is the classic reagent set for the **diazotization** of a primary aromatic amine. The -NH2 group is converted into a diazonium salt, -N2+Cl-.\n        *   Product after step 1: 4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride `[Cl-][+N≡N]-C6H4-CH2CHO`.\n    *   **Reagent 2: H2O.** Adding water to an aryl diazonium salt (often with gentle heating) results in a **hydrolysis** reaction, where the diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group, forming a phenol.\n        *   Product after step 2: **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde** `HO-C6H4-CH2CHO`.\n\n4.  **Step 3: Analyze the Final Reaction.**\n    *   **Substrate:** 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde `(HO-C6H4-CH2CHO)`.\n    *   **Reagents: aq. KOH, Heat.** This is a strong base (KOH) with heat. The substrate is an aldehyde with acidic alpha-protons (the protons on the -CH2- group). These are the classic conditions for an **aldol condensation**.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) removes an acidic alpha-proton from one molecule to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n            `HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO + OH- ⇌ HO-C6H4-CH(-)-CHO + H2O`\n        2.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n            `HO-C6H4-CH(-)-CHO` + `HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO` → `(HO-C6H4-CH2)-CH(O-)-CH(CHO)-(C6H4-OH)`\n        3.  **Protonation:** The resulting alkoxide is protonated by water to form a β-hydroxy aldehyde, the **aldol addition product**.\n            Product: `(HO-C6H4-CH2)-CH(OH)-CH(CHO)-(C6H4-OH)`\n            The IUPAC name is 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal. This structure matches option **D**.\n        4.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction is carried out with **heat**. Heat promotes the elimination of a water molecule (dehydration) from the aldol addition product to form an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The hydroxyl group from the β-carbon (C3) and a proton from the α-carbon (C2) are eliminated.\n            `(HO-C6H4-CH2)-CH(OH)-CH(CHO)-(C6H4-OH)` --(Heat)--> `(HO-C6H4-CH2)-CH=C(CHO)-(C6H4-OH)` + H2O\n            This dehydration is highly favorable because the resulting double bond is conjugated with both the aldehyde's C=O group and the aromatic ring on C2, creating a very stable system.\n\n5.  **Step 4: Identify the Final Product Structure and Name.**\n    *   The final condensation product is `(HO-C6H4-CH2)-CH=C(CHO)-(C6H4-OH)`.\n    *   Let's determine the IUPAC name for this structure:\n        *   The principal functional group is the aldehyde (`-al`).\n        *   The longest carbon chain containing the aldehyde has 4 carbons (`but-`).\n        *   There is a double bond at C2 (`-2-en`). So the parent chain is `but-2-enal`.\n        *   There are two substituents: a `(4-hydroxyphenyl)` group at C2 and another `(4-hydroxyphenyl)` group at C4.\n        *   The full name is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n    *   This name exactly matches option **A**.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The reaction sequence converts 4-(aminophenyl)acetaldehyde into 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, which then undergoes a self-aldol condensation (due to KOH and heat) to yield 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal as the final stable product. Option D is the intermediate aldol addition product, but the specified heat drives the reaction to the final condensed product, A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

This matches.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\n    *   **Starting Material:** 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde.\n\n    *   **Reagent 1: NaNO2 + HCl (Diazotization)**\n        This set of reagents converts a primary aromatic amine into a diazonium salt. The -NH2 group on the benzene ring is converted to -N2+Cl-.\n        The intermediate is **4-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride**.\n\n    *   **Reagent 2: H2O (Hydrolysis)**\n        Adding water and warming the diazonium salt solution causes the diazonium group (-N2+) to be replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH), releasing nitrogen gas (N2).\n        The product of this step is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n    *   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation)**\n        4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde is an aldehyde with acidic α-protons (the protons on the -CH2- group). In the presence of a strong base (KOH) and heat, it will undergo a self-aldol condensation.\n\n        1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH removes an α-proton from one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n        2.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n        3.  **Protonation:** The resulting alkoxide is protonated to form an aldol addition product: **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This is option A).\n        4.  **Dehydration:** The condition \"Heat\" indicates that the reaction proceeds further. The aldol addition product undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to form a more stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The hydroxyl group on carbon 3 and the acidic proton on carbon 2 are eliminated.\n\n        The final product is the aldol condensation product: **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Match the final product with the given options.**\n\n    *   The structure of the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n    *   Let's check the options:\n        A) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal - This is the intermediate aldol addition product, formed before dehydration. The \"Heat\" condition makes this unlikely to be the final product.\n        B) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal - Incorrect structure. The phenyl groups should have hydroxyl substituents, and the double bond position is wrong.\n        C) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal - Incorrect structure. This would result from a different reaction, not a self-condensation of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n        D) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal - This name correctly describes the final α,β-unsaturated aldehyde formed from the self-condensation and dehydration of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product:\n\n**1. Identification of the Starting Material**\n\nFirst, we need to deduce the structure of the initial compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO from its 1H-NMR data.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO.\n    *   The degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 9 - 4 = 5. A DoU of 4 is typical for a benzene ring, and the remaining 1 corresponds to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **1H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) splitting indicates it is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-), according to the n+1 rule (1 proton sees 2 adjacent protons, 2+1=3, a triplet).\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly suggest a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is characteristic of an amino group (-NH2). The broadness is due to rapid proton exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-). The doublet (d) splitting means it is adjacent to a single proton (-CH-), which is consistent with it being coupled to the aldehyde proton (-CHO).\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   The substituents are an amino group (-NH2) and an acetaldehyde group (-CH2CHO).\n    *   Let's check if the structure, 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal (or 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde), matches the molecular formula C8H9NO.\n        *   Benzene ring (C6H4) + Amino group (NH2) + Acetaldehyde group (C2H3O) = C8H(4+2+3)NO = C8H9NO.\n    *   The structure is consistent with all the data.\n\n    The starting material is:\n    ```\n        O=CH-CH2-Ph-NH2 (para-substituted)\n    ```\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\nNow, we trace the starting material through the given series of reactions.\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO2 + HCl**\n    *   These reagents are used for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The reaction is typically carried out at low temperatures (0-5 °C).\n    *   The primary amino group (-NH2) on the benzene ring is converted into a diazonium salt group (-N2+Cl-).\n    *   The product of this step is 2-(4-diazoniumphenyl)ethanal chloride.\n\n*   **Step 2: H2O**\n    *   Adding water to the diazonium salt solution and warming it up results in the substitution of the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group (-OH). This is a standard method to synthesize phenols from anilines.\n    *   The product of this step is 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal (or 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde).\n    ```\n        O=CH-CH2-Ph-OH (para-substituted)\n    ```\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   This step involves reacting the product from step 2, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, with a strong base (KOH) and heat.\n    *   4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde is an aldehyde that has protons on the carbon alpha to the carbonyl group (the -CH2- protons).\n    *   Aldehydes with α-hydrogens undergo a base-catalyzed aldol condensation. Since there is only one type of aldehyde, this will be a self-condensation.\n    *   The reaction proceeds in two stages:\n        1.  **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH-) removes an α-proton from one aldehyde molecule to form an enolate ion. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second aldehyde molecule. Protonation of the resulting alkoxide yields an aldol addition product, which is a β-hydroxy aldehyde.\n            The structure of the aldol addition product is 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal. This corresponds to option (C).\n        2.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction mixture is heated. Heat promotes the elimination of a water molecule (dehydration) from the aldol addition product. The α-proton and the β-hydroxyl group are removed, forming a double bond between the α and β carbons. This results in an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n            The formation of the conjugated system (C=C double bond conjugated with both a phenyl ring and the carbonyl group) makes this dehydration step thermodynamically favorable.\n\n    Let's determine the structure of the final condensation product:\n    *   Aldol addition product: `(HO-Ph)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(Ph-OH)-CHO`\n    *   Dehydration removes the -OH from C3 and an -H from C2:\n    *   Final Product: `(HO-Ph)-CH2-CH=C(Ph-OH)-CHO`\n    *   The systematic name for this structure is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**3. Matching the Product with Options**\n\n*   The final product derived from the reaction sequence is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n*   Comparing this with the given options:\n    *   A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect structure and lacks hydroxyl groups.\n    *   B) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: This perfectly matches our derived final product.\n    *   C) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the intermediate aldol addition product, not the final product under heating conditions.\n    *   D) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect structure.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the reaction sequence is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material from its molecular formula and NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    DBE = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 9 - 4 = 5.\n    A DBE of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (4 DBE) and one additional double bond or ring (1 DBE), which is consistent with a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) indicates it's adjacent to a CH₂ group (n+1 rule, 2+1=3 peaks). So, we have a -CH₂-CHO fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This corresponds to the CH₂ group adjacent to the aldehyde. The doublet (d) is due to coupling with the single aldehyde proton (1+1=2 peaks). This confirms the -CH₂-CHO fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, both doublets with an integration of 2H, are classic for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for 2 protons in this region is typical for a primary amine (-NH₂).\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    We have three fragments:\n    1.  A para-substituted benzene ring (C₆H₄)\n    2.  An ethyl-aldehyde group (-CH₂CHO)\n    3.  An amino group (-NH₂)\n\n    Connecting these fragments gives the structure 2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde. The -NH₂ and -CH₂CHO groups are at positions 1 and 4 of the benzene ring. The chemical shifts support this: the electron-donating -NH₂ group shields its ortho protons (making them appear at a lower ppm, 6.51 ppm), while the protons ortho to the -CH₂CHO group are less shielded (higher ppm, 6.98 ppm).\n\n    **Starting Material (A):** 2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde.\n     \n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\n*   **Reaction 1 & 2: NaNO₂ + HCl, followed by H₂O.**\n    1.  **NaNO₂ + HCl (0-5 °C):** These are the reagents for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The -NH₂ group is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻).\n    2.  **H₂O (often with gentle warming):** The diazonium salt is unstable and reacts with water to replace the -N₂⁺ group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group, releasing nitrogen gas (N₂). This is a standard synthesis of phenols from anilines.\n\n    The product after these two steps is **2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde (B)**.\n     \n\n*   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat.**\n    *   The reagent is a strong base (KOH) with heat, and the substrate is an aldehyde (2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde) with acidic α-protons (the protons on the carbon adjacent to the C=O group). These are the classic conditions for an **aldol condensation** reaction.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) from KOH removes an acidic α-proton from one molecule of the aldehyde to form an enolate ion.\n        2.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The nucleophilic enolate ion attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second aldehyde molecule. This forms an aldol addition product (an alkoxide).\n        3.  **Protonation:** The alkoxide is protonated by water to give the aldol addition product, **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal (C)**. This corresponds to option (B).\n        4.  **Dehydration:** The condition \"Heat\" strongly favors the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. The hydroxyl group at C-3 and the acidic proton at C-2 are removed, forming a double bond between C-2 and C-3. This dehydration step is called condensation. The product is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, which is stabilized by conjugation between the new C=C double bond, the C=O group, and one of the phenyl rings.\n\n    **Final Product (D):** The final product is the result of this dehydration.\n    The structure is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n     \n\n**Step 3: Match the final product with the given options.**\n\n*   A) **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal:** This name perfectly matches the structure of our derived final product from the aldol condensation.\n*   B) **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal:** This is the intermediate aldol addition product, which would dehydrate upon heating.\n*   C) **2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal:** This molecule lacks the hydroxyl groups on the phenyl rings.\n*   D) **4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal:** This molecule is not a dimer; it results from a different reaction pathway.\n\nGiven the reaction conditions, especially the application of heat, the condensation product is the expected final product.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the structure of the starting material from its molecular formula and NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula for DBE is C - H/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    DBE = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBE) and one additional degree of unsaturation (a C=C or C=O double bond, or another ring).\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern, a triplet (t), indicates it is adjacent to a carbon with 2 protons (a CH2 group), according to the n+1 rule. This suggests a `-CH2-CHO` fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to 2 protons. Its chemical shift is typical for protons on a carbon adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (like an aldehyde or an aromatic ring). The splitting, a doublet (d), indicates it's adjacent to a carbon with 1 proton (a CH group). This is consistent with the aldehyde proton, confirming the `-CH2-CHO` fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. They are both doublets, each integrating to 2 protons. This symmetrical pattern is a classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is characteristic of a primary amine (-NH2) group attached to an aromatic ring (an aniline derivative). The broadness is due to fast proton exchange and nitrogen's quadrupole moment.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    Based on the fragments identified, we have a para-disubstituted benzene ring. One substituent is the amino group (-NH2), and the other is the 2-oxoethyl group (-CH2-CHO).\n    The structure is 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal (also known as p-aminophenylacetaldehyde).\n    Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4 (ring) + NH2 + CH2 + CHO = C8H(4+2+2+1)NO = C8H9NO.

The -NH2 group is converted into a diazonium salt group (-N2+Cl-).\n    The product after this step is 2-(4-diazoniumphenyl)ethanal chloride.\n     \n\n*   **Reaction 2: H2O**\n    The diazonium salt is then treated with water. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group and is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group via a substitution reaction (hydrolysis), releasing nitrogen gas (N2). This reaction forms a phenol.\n    The product after this step is 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal (also known as p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde).\n     ![Phenol Intermediate: 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) ethanal](https://i.imgur.com/i9oF2vR.png)\n\n*   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    The intermediate, 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal, is an aldehyde that possesses alpha-protons (the protons on the -CH2- group). When treated with a strong base (KOH) and heat, it undergoes a self-**aldol condensation**.\n    1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH removes an acidic alpha-proton to form a resonance-stabilized enolate.\n    2.  **Aldol Addition:** The enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of the aldehyde. This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is the aldol addition product.\n        The structure of this addition product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option C).\n         \n    3.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction condition specifies \"Heat\". Heating the aldol addition product causes the elimination of a molecule of water (dehydration). The hydroxyl group from the β-carbon (C3) and a proton from the α-carbon (C2) are removed. This forms an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. This dehydration is highly favorable because the resulting double bond is in conjugation with both the aldehyde's carbonyl group and the aromatic ring on C2, creating a very stable, extended conjugated system.\n        The final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n         \n\n**Step 3: Match the final product with the given options.**\n\n*   A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect substituents (phenyl instead of hydroxyphenyl) and wrong double bond position.\n*   B) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect structure; only has one hydroxyphenyl group.\n*   C) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the aldol addition intermediate, not the final product under heating conditions.\n*   D) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: This is the final, dehydrated aldol condensation product.

A primary aromatic amine (Ar-NH₂) reacts with nitrous acid (HONO, formed in situ from NaNO₂ and HCl) to form an aromatic diazonium salt (Ar-N₂⁺Cl⁻).\n    *   The product of this step is **p-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride** ([N₂⁺]-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO).\n\n*   **Reaction 2: H₂O, Heat**\n    *   Aromatic diazonium salts are generally unstable and react with water upon warming to replace the diazonium group (-N₂⁺) with a hydroxyl group (-OH). Nitrogen gas (N₂) is evolved as a byproduct.\n    *   The product of this step is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde** (HO-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO).\n\n*   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   The product from the previous step, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, is an aldehyde that has acidic alpha-protons (the protons on the -CH₂- group).\n    *   KOH is a strong base, and heat is applied. These are the classic conditions for a **base-catalyzed self-aldol condensation**.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  **Addition:** The base (OH⁻) removes an alpha-proton from one molecule of the aldehyde to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second aldehyde molecule. After protonation of the resulting alkoxide, an aldol addition product is formed.\n            *   Intermediate Product (Aldol Adduct): **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This corresponds to option (D).\n        2.  **Condensation (Dehydration):** Because the reaction is heated, the aldol addition product readily undergoes dehydration (elimination of a water molecule). The base removes the acidic alpha-proton (at C2), and the hydroxyl group from the beta-carbon (C3) leaves. This forms a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The stability is enhanced because the new C=C double bond is in conjugation with both the aldehyde's C=O group and one of the aromatic rings.\n            *   Final Product (Condensation Product): The double bond forms between C2 and C3, resulting in **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Final Product.**\n\nThe question asks for the final product. Given the condition \"Heat\", the reaction will not stop at the aldol addition stage (D). The elimination of water is thermodynamically favorable due to the formation of a highly conjugated system. Therefore, the final isolated product is the condensation product.\n\n*   **Final Product Structure:**\n    (HO-C₆H₄)-CH=C(CHO)-(CH₂-C₆H₄-OH) is incorrect. Let's redraw the condensation from the correct adduct.\n    Adduct: (HO-C₆H₄)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH(C₆H₄-OH)-CHO\n    Dehydration (loss of H from C2 and OH from C3):\n    (HO-C₆H₄)-CH₂-CH=C(C₆H₄-OH)-CHO\n    Let's name this: The main chain is a but-2-enal. It has a (4-hydroxyphenyl) group at C2 and a (4-hydroxyphenyl)methyl group at C4? No, my structural analysis of the aldol product was correct the first time. Let's re-verify.\n\n    Enolate [HO-Ph-CH-CHO]⁻ attacks electrophile HO-Ph-CH₂-CHO.\n    The α-carbon of the enolate attacks the carbonyl carbon of the electrophile.\n    Product: HO-Ph-CH(CHO)-CH(OH)-CH₂-Ph-OH\n    Main chain is butanal.\n    C1 is CHO.\n    C2 has substituent HO-Ph.\n    C3 has substituent OH.\n    C4 has substituent HO-Ph.\n    Name: 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal. This is option D.\n\n    Dehydration removes H from C2 and OH from C3.\n    A double bond forms between C2 and C3.\n    Product: HO-Ph-CH=C(CHO)-Ph-OH\n    Main chain is but-2-enal.\n    C1 is CHO.\n    C2 has substituent HO-Ph.\n    C3 has H and is attached to C4.\n    C4 has substituent HO-Ph.\n    Structure: HO-Ph-CH₂-CH=C(Ph-OH)-CHO <-- No, this is incorrect again.\n\n    Let's write it out clearly one last time.\n    Addition product: **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option D)\n     \n    Dehydration removes the **-H from C2** and the **-OH from C3**.\n    A double bond forms between **C2 and C3**.\n     \n    Final product name: The main chain is a **but-2-enal**. There is a (4-hydroxyphenyl) group at C2 and another (4-hydroxyphenyl) group at C4.\n    Name: **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This matches option C.\n\nThe final product after heating is the dehydrated, conjugated molecule.\n\nFinal Answer: **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting compound from the given molecular formula and NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for DoU is C + 1 - H/2 + N/2.\n    DoU = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (e.g., C=C or C=O).\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This signal is in the characteristic region for an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) splitting indicates it is coupled to an adjacent methylene group (-CH2-), according to the n+1 rule (a triplet means 2 adjacent protons).\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal represents a methylene group (-CH2-). The doublet (d) splitting indicates it is coupled to a single adjacent proton (a doublet means 1 adjacent proton). This corresponds to the aldehyde proton. So, we have confirmed the presence of a `-CH2-CHO` group.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The presence of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The chemical shifts are relatively upfield (benzene is ~7.3 ppm), which suggests the ring is substituted with an electron-donating group.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet for 2 protons is characteristic of a primary amine (-NH2) group attached to an aromatic ring. The nitrogen in the molecular formula and the electron-donating nature required to explain the upfield aromatic shifts confirm this assignment.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    Based on the fragments identified (-CHO, -CH2-, 1,4-disubstituted benzene, -NH2), the starting compound is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n    *   Formula check: C6H4 (ring) + NH2 + CH2 + CHO = C8H9NO. This matches.\n    *   Structure:\n        ```\n          H2N--[Benzene Ring]--CH2--CHO\n        ```\n    This structure is fully consistent with all the provided data.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Reagents 1 & 2: 1. NaNO2 + HCl; 2. H2O**\n    1.  The first set of reagents (NaNO2 + HCl, typically at 0-5 °C) is used for the **diazotization** of a primary aromatic amine. The -NH2 group is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2⁺Cl⁻).\n    2.  The second reagent (H2O, often with gentle warming) is used to hydrolyze the diazonium salt. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group (it leaves as N2 gas) and is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group from water.\n    *   This two-step process effectively converts the amino group into a hydroxyl group.\n    *   **Product after Step 2:** **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n        ```\n          HO--[Benzene Ring]--CH2--CHO\n        ```\n\n*   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   This step involves reacting 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (KOH) in water, with heating.\n    *   The substrate, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, is an aldehyde that has acidic protons on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon).\n    *   These conditions (aldehyde with α-hydrogens + strong base + heat) are classic for an **aldol condensation** reaction.\n\n**Step 3: Predict the product of the Aldol Condensation.**\n\nThe aldol condensation is a two-part process:\n\n1.  **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH⁻) removes an α-proton from one aldehyde molecule to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate then attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second aldehyde molecule. After protonation, this forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde.\n    *   Let's denote the 4-hydroxyphenyl group as Ar-OH. The reaction is:\n        Ar-OH-CH2-CHO  +  Ar-OH-CH2-CHO  --(KOH)-->  Ar-OH-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(Ar-OH)-CHO\n    *   The systematic name of this addition product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This corresponds to option (C).\n\n2.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The term \"Heat\" in the reaction conditions indicates that the aldol addition product will undergo dehydration (elimination of a water molecule). The acidic α-proton and the β-hydroxyl group are removed, forming a double bond. This is highly favorable as it creates a stable, conjugated system (α,β-unsaturated aldehyde).\n    *   Ar-OH-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(Ar-OH)-CHO  --(Heat)-->  Ar-OH-CH2-CH=C(Ar-OH)-CHO + H2O\n    *   The systematic name of this final condensation product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This corresponds to option (B).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nSince the reaction is heated, the reaction will proceed to completion to form the more thermodynamically stable dehydrated product. The final product is the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde formed from the full aldol condensation.\n\nTherefore, the final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material (C8H9NO) from the 1H-NMR data.**\n\n1.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    The formula for DoU is C - H/2 - N/2 + 1.\n    DoU = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    (Correction from initial thought: DoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5).\n    A DoU of 4 usually indicates a benzene ring. The extra degree of unsaturation corresponds to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H-NMR signals:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** The chemical shift (> 9 ppm) is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The multiplicity is a triplet (t), which means it's coupled to an adjacent methylene group (-CH2-), according to the n+1 rule (n=2 neighbors).\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly suggest a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for 2 protons in this region is typical for a primary amine group (-NH2) attached to an aromatic ring. The broadening is due to fast proton exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-). The multiplicity is a doublet (d), indicating it is coupled to a single adjacent proton (n=1 neighbor). This fits with it being adjacent to the aldehyde proton (-CHO).\n\n3.  **Assemble the structure:**\n    *   We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   One substituent is an amino group (-NH2).\n    *   The other substituent is a -CH2-CHO group (an acetaldehyde group). The coupling confirms this: the -CHO proton is a triplet (coupled to -CH2-), and the -CH2- protons are a doublet (coupled to -CHO).\n    *   Putting these pieces together gives **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n    *   Let's check the molecular formula: C6H4 (from the ring) + C2H3O (from -CH2CHO) + NH2 (from the amine) = C8H(4+3+2)NO = C8H9NO. This matches the given formula.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\nThe starting material is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Reagents 1 & 2: NaNO2 + HCl, then H2O.**\n    *   The first set of reagents (NaNO2, HCl, typically at 0-5°C) is used for the **diazotization** of a primary aromatic amine. The -NH2 group is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n    *   The second reagent (H2O, often with warming) reacts with the diazonium salt to replace the -N2+ group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group, releasing N2 gas. This is a standard method to convert an aniline to a phenol.\n    *   The product after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Reagent 3: aq.

This enolate then attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule.\n        *   **Aldol Addition:** The initial product is the β-hydroxy aldehyde, called the aldol adduct.\n            *   Molecule 1 (enolate): [HO-C6H4-CH-CHO]⁻\n            *   Molecule 2 (aldehyde): HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO\n            *   Attack and protonation yield the aldol adduct: 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal. This corresponds to option (D).\n        *   **Aldol Condensation (Dehydration):** The reaction is carried out with **heat**. Heating an aldol addition product in the presence of base (or acid) causes dehydration (elimination of a water molecule) to form an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. This product is thermodynamically more stable due to the extended conjugation between the double bond and the carbonyl group.\n            *   Aldol Adduct: HO-Ph-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(Ph-OH)-CHO\n            *   The hydroxyl group is on the β-carbon (C-3), and an acidic proton is on the α-carbon (C-2).\n            *   Elimination of H2O (the -OH from C-3 and the -H from C-2) forms a double bond between C-2 and C-3.\n            *   Final Product: HO-Ph-CH2-CH=C(Ph-OH)-CHO\n        *   **Naming the final product:**\n            *   The main chain is a butenal (4 carbons, aldehyde at C-1, double bond at C-2). So, `but-2-enal`.\n            *   There is a (4-hydroxyphenyl) group at C-2 and another (4-hydroxyphenyl) group at C-4.\n            *   The IUPAC name is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This matches option (A).\n\n*   **Step 3: Conclusion**\n    Since the reaction is heated, the final isolated product is the result of condensation (dehydration), not just addition.

This leaves 1 DBE, which corresponds to a carbonyl group (C=O) or a C=C double bond.\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   `9.72 ppm (t, 1H)`: This chemical shift and multiplicity (triplet) is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO) that is adjacent to a CH2 group (n+1=3, so n=2). This confirms the presence of a `-CH2-CHO` fragment and the C=O group.\n    *   `6.98 ppm (d, 2H)` and `6.51 ppm (d, 2H)`: Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, strongly indicate a *para*-substituted benzene ring. The relatively upfield shifts suggest the ring is substituted with electron-donating groups.\n    *   `6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)`: A broad singlet for two protons is typical for a primary amine (-NH2) group. An amine is an electron-donating group, consistent with the aromatic signals.\n    *   `3.66 ppm (d, 2H)`: A doublet for two protons, which corresponds to the -CH2- group coupled to the aldehyde proton (-CHO), as established from the aldehyde signal.\n\n*   **Assembling the structure:**\n    Putting all the pieces together (a *para*-substituted benzene ring, an -NH2 group, and a -CH2CHO group), the starting compound is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. The formula C8H9NO matches this structure (C6H4 for the ring, NH2, and C2H3O for the side chain).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the sequence of reactions.**\n\nThe starting material is 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: NaNO2 + HCl (diazotization)**\n    This reaction converts the primary aromatic amine (-NH2) into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n    The product is **4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride**.\n    \n    `H2N-C6H4-CH2CHO  -- (NaNO2, HCl) -->  Cl-N2+-C6H4-CH2CHO`\n\n*   **Reaction 2: H2O (hydrolysis)**\n    Warming the aqueous solution of the diazonium salt causes the -N2+ group to be replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group, releasing N2 gas.\n    The product is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n    \n    `Cl-N2+-C6H4-CH2CHO  -- (H2O, Heat) -->  HO-C6H4-CH2CHO + N2 + HCl`\n\n*   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation)**\n    The reactant for this step is 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This molecule has both an aldehyde functional group and acidic α-hydrogens (the protons on the -CH2- group). In the presence of a strong base (KOH) and heat, it will undergo a self-aldol condensation.\n\n    *   **Step a: Aldol Addition:** The base (OH-) removes an α-proton to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. Protonation of the resulting alkoxide yields a β-hydroxy aldehyde, known as the aldol adduct.\n        \n        Aldol Adduct: **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This corresponds to **Option D**.\n        \n        `2 * HO-C6H4-CH2CHO --(KOH)--> HO-C6H4-CH(CHO)-CH(OH)-CH2-C6H4-OH`\n\n    *   **Step b: Dehydration:** The reaction is performed with \"Heat\". In aldol reactions, heating the aldol adduct in the presence of base causes dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to form an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. This is because the resulting conjugated system is thermodynamically very stable. The α-proton is removed, and the β-hydroxyl group is eliminated.\n        \n        `HO-C6H4-CH(CHO)-CH(OH)-CH2-C6H4-OH --(Heat, -H2O)--> HO-C6H4-C(CHO)=CH-CH2-C6H4-OH`\n\n        Final Product: The resulting α,β-unsaturated aldehyde is named **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This corresponds to **Option B**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe reaction proceeds through the aldol adduct (D), but because heat is applied, the final, stable product is the dehydrated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde (B). Therefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n**1. Analysis of the Starting Material (C8H9NO)**\n\n*   **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   DoU = C + 1 + (N/2) - (H/2)\n    *   DoU = 8 + 1 + (1/2) - (9/2) = 9 + 0.5 - 4.5 = 5\n    *   A DoU of 5 is indicative of a substituted benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DoU) plus one additional degree of unsaturation (a C=C, C=O, or C=N bond, or another ring).\n\n*   **Analyze the 1H-NMR Data:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern, a triplet (t), means it is adjacent to a carbon with 2 protons (a CH2 group), according to the n+1 rule.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, both doublets integrating to 2 protons each, strongly suggest a para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is typical for a primary amine group (-NH2). The protons are exchangeable, leading to a broad signal.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** A doublet in the aliphatic region integrating to 2 protons. This corresponds to a CH2 group. The doublet splitting means it's adjacent to a carbon with 1 proton (a CH group), which in this case is the aldehyde's CH.\n\n*   **Assemble the Structure:**\n    *   We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   The two substituents are an amino group (-NH2) and a 2-oxoethyl group (-CH2CHO).\n    *   Combining these pieces gives the structure **2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal**. Let's verify it matches the molecular formula C8H9NO.\n        *   C: 6 (ring) + 2 (side chain) = 8\n        *   H: 4 (ring) + 2 (NH2) + 2 (CH2) + 1 (CHO) = 9\n        *   N: 1\n        *   O: 1\n    *   The structure is consistent with the formula and all NMR signals. The -NH2 group is electron-donating, shielding the ortho protons (6.51 ppm), and the -CH2CHO group is weakly electron-withdrawing.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO2 + HCl**\n    This reagent mixture is used for diazotization. The primary aromatic amine group (-NH2) is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n    *   *Starting Material:* 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal\n    *   *Product after Step 1:* 4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride\n\n*   **Step 2: H2O**\n    Adding water to the diazonium salt (often with gentle warming) leads to hydrolysis. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group (it leaves as N2 gas) and is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group from water.\n    *   *Intermediate Product:* 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    This step subjects the intermediate, 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal, to a strong base (KOH) and heat. These are the classic conditions for an **aldol condensation** reaction.\n    *   **Aldol Addition:**\n        1.  The base (OH-) removes an acidic alpha-proton from one molecule of the aldehyde (the protons on the -CH2- group) to form an enolate.\n        2.  This enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second aldehyde molecule.\n        3.  After protonation, this forms an aldol addition product: **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This corresponds to option (C).\n    *   **Aldol Condensation (Dehydration):**\n        The \"Heat\" in the reaction conditions promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol adduct. The alpha-proton (on C2) and the beta-hydroxyl group (on C3) are eliminated to form a stable, conjugated C=C double bond. This process is called condensation.\n        *   Aldol Adduct: `(HO)Ph-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(PhOH)-CHO`\n        *   Dehydration removes the H from C2 and the OH from C3.\n        *   Final Product: `(HO)Ph-CH2-CH=C(PhOH)-CHO`\n\n*   **Identify the Final Product:**\n    *   The name of the condensation product `(HO)Ph-CH2-CH=C(PhOH)-CHO` is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n    *   This matches option **A**.\n    *   Option (C) is the intermediate aldol adduct, but the inclusion of \"Heat\" indicates the reaction proceeds to the final condensation product.\n    *   Option (B) has an incorrect molecular formula.\n    *   Option (D) incorrectly has phenyl groups instead of the hydroxyphenyl groups that are formed in the second step of the reaction.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the entire reaction sequence is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n**1. Analysis of the Starting Material (C8H9NO)**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    A benzene ring accounts for 4 DBEs, and a carbonyl group (C=O) accounts for 1 DBE, totaling 5. This suggests the presence of a benzene ring and a carbonyl group.\n\n*   **Analysis of ¹H-NMR Data:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet multiplicity (t) indicates that it is coupled to a neighboring methylene group (-CH₂-), with two equivalent protons (n=2, so 2+1=3 peaks, a triplet).\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This is a methylene group (-CH₂-). The doublet multiplicity (d) indicates it's coupled to a single proton (n=1, so 1+1=2 peaks, a doublet). This confirms the presence of a **-CH₂-CHO** fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are a classic pattern for a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons in this region strongly suggests a primary amine group (**-NH₂**). This signal is broad due to quadrupole relaxation of the nitrogen nucleus and its protons often exchange with trace amounts of water or D₂O.\n\n*   **Putting it all together:** We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring with two substituents: an amino group (-NH₂) and an acetaldehyde group (-CH₂CHO).\n    The structure is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n    Let's check the molecular formula: C₆H₄ (ring) + CH₂CHO (side chain) + NH₂ (substituent) = C₈H(4+2+1+2)NO = C₈H₉NO. The formula matches.\n\n    **Starting Material:**\n    ```\n       H₂N-Ph-CH₂-CHO (para-substitution)\n    ```\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **Step 1 & 2: 1. NaNO₂ + HCl; 2.

The -NH₂ group is converted into a diazonium salt, -N₂⁺Cl⁻.\n        *   Intermediate 1: 4-(diazonium chloride)phenylacetaldehyde `[Cl⁻N₂⁺-Ph-CH₂-CHO]`\n    *   The second step (H₂O, Heat) is the hydrolysis of the aryl diazonium salt to form a phenol. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group (it leaves as N₂ gas), and it is replaced by an -OH group from water.\n        *   Intermediate 2: **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde** `[HO-Ph-CH₂-CHO]`\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   The reagent is a strong base (KOH) with heat. The reactant is 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, which has an aldehyde group and acidic alpha-protons on the -CH₂- group.\n    *   These are the classic conditions for an **Aldol Condensation**. It is a self-condensation because only one type of aldehyde is present.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  **Enolate formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) from KOH deprotonates the acidic α-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the C=O group) to form an enolate ion.\n            `HO-Ph-CH₂-CHO + OH⁻ ⇌ [HO-Ph-CH-CHO]⁻ + H₂O` (Enolate)\n        2.  **Aldol Addition:** The enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of another molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n            `[HO-Ph-CH-CHO]⁻ + HO-Ph-CH₂-CHO → HO-Ph-CH₂(CH-O⁻)-CH(CHO)-Ph-OH`\n        3.  **Protonation:** The resulting alkoxide is protonated by water to form a β-hydroxy aldehyde, the aldol addition product.\n            `HO-Ph-CH₂(CH-O⁻)-CH(CHO)-Ph-OH + H₂O → HO-Ph-CH₂(CH-OH)-CH(CHO)-Ph-OH + OH⁻`\n            The structure of this addition product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This corresponds to **Option D**.\n\n        4.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of \"Heat\" in the reaction conditions promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. The -OH group from the β-carbon (C3) and a proton from the α-carbon (C2) are eliminated. This is favored because the resulting C=C double bond is conjugated with both the aldehyde's C=O group and one of the phenyl rings, creating a very stable α,β-unsaturated system.\n            `HO-Ph-CH₂(C³H-OH)-(C²H)(CHO)-Ph-OH  --Heat--> HO-Ph-CH₂-C³H=C²(CHO)-Ph-OH + H₂O`\n\n*   **Identifying the Final Product:**\n    *   The aldol addition product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option D).\n    *   The final condensation product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal** (Option B).\n    *   Since the reaction is carried out with heat, the reaction proceeds to completion to form the more stable condensation product.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n**Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **Given:** Molecular formula (C8H9NO), 1H-NMR data, and a three-step reaction sequence.\n    *   **Goal:** Identify the final product from the given options.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Identify the Starting Compound (C8H9NO) using NMR data.**\n    *   **Calculate Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n        *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) - (X/2)\n        *   DoU = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n        *   A benzene ring accounts for 4 DoU. The remaining 1 DoU suggests a C=O or C=C double bond.\n\n    *   **Analyze the 1H-NMR Spectrum:**\n        *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This high chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern, a triplet (t), means it's adjacent to a CH2 group (n+1 rule, 2+1=3 peaks). So we have a `-CH2-CHO` fragment.\n        *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets integrating to 2H each strongly indicate a para-disubstituted (1,4-substituted) benzene ring.\n        *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) for 2 protons in this region is typical for an amino group (-NH2), where protons can exchange.\n        *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This is a methylene (-CH2-) group. The splitting, a doublet (d), means it's adjacent to a single CH proton (n+1 rule, 1+1=2 peaks). This fits perfectly with the `-CH2-CHO` fragment identified from the aldehyde signal. The chemical shift around 3.66 ppm is also consistent with a benzylic CH2 group adjacent to an electron-withdrawing carbonyl group.\n\n    *   **Assemble the Structure:**\n        *   We have the following fragments: a para-disubstituted benzene ring (C6H4), an amino group (-NH2), and an acetaldehyde side chain (-CH2CHO).\n        *   Let's put them together: The two substituents on the para-disubstituted ring must be -NH2 and -CH2CHO.\n        *   Proposed Structure: **4-(aminophenyl)acetaldehyde** (also known as p-(2-oxoethyl)aniline).\n        *   Let's check the molecular formula: The structure is `H2N-C6H4-CH2CHO`.\n            *   Carbons: 6 (ring) + 1 (CH2) + 1 (CHO) = 8\n            *   Hydrogens: 2 (NH2) + 4 (ring) + 2 (CH2) + 1 (CHO) = 9\n            *   Nitrogen: 1\n            *   Oxygen: 1\n            *   Formula: C8H9NO.

The -NH2 group is converted into a diazonium salt, -N2+Cl-.\n        *   Product after step 1: 4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride `[Cl-][+N≡N]-C6H4-CH2CHO`.\n    *   **Reagent 2: H2O.** Adding water to an aryl diazonium salt (often with gentle heating) results in a **hydrolysis** reaction, where the diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group, forming a phenol.\n        *   Product after step 2: **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde** `HO-C6H4-CH2CHO`.\n\n4.  **Step 3: Analyze the Final Reaction.**\n    *   **Substrate:** 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde `(HO-C6H4-CH2CHO)`.\n    *   **Reagents: aq. KOH, Heat.** This is a strong base (KOH) with heat. The substrate is an aldehyde with acidic alpha-protons (the protons on the -CH2- group). These are the classic conditions for an **aldol condensation**.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) removes an acidic alpha-proton from one molecule to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n            `HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO + OH- ⇌ HO-C6H4-CH(-)-CHO + H2O`\n        2.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n            `HO-C6H4-CH(-)-CHO` + `HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO` → `(HO-C6H4-CH2)-CH(O-)-CH(CHO)-(C6H4-OH)`\n        3.  **Protonation:** The resulting alkoxide is protonated by water to form a β-hydroxy aldehyde, the **aldol addition product**.\n            Product: `(HO-C6H4-CH2)-CH(OH)-CH(CHO)-(C6H4-OH)`\n            The IUPAC name is 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal. This structure matches option **D**.\n        4.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction is carried out with **heat**. Heat promotes the elimination of a water molecule (dehydration) from the aldol addition product to form an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The hydroxyl group from the β-carbon (C3) and a proton from the α-carbon (C2) are eliminated.\n            `(HO-C6H4-CH2)-CH(OH)-CH(CHO)-(C6H4-OH)` --(Heat)--> `(HO-C6H4-CH2)-CH=C(CHO)-(C6H4-OH)` + H2O\n            This dehydration is highly favorable because the resulting double bond is conjugated with both the aldehyde's C=O group and the aromatic ring on C2, creating a very stable system.\n\n5.  **Step 4: Identify the Final Product Structure and Name.**\n    *   The final condensation product is `(HO-C6H4-CH2)-CH=C(CHO)-(C6H4-OH)`.\n    *   Let's determine the IUPAC name for this structure:\n        *   The principal functional group is the aldehyde (`-al`).\n        *   The longest carbon chain containing the aldehyde has 4 carbons (`but-`).\n        *   There is a double bond at C2 (`-2-en`). So the parent chain is `but-2-enal`.\n        *   There are two substituents: a `(4-hydroxyphenyl)` group at C2 and another `(4-hydroxyphenyl)` group at C4.\n        *   The full name is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n    *   This name exactly matches option **A**.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The reaction sequence converts 4-(aminophenyl)acetaldehyde into 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, which then undergoes a self-aldol condensation (due to KOH and heat) to yield 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal as the final stable product. Option D is the intermediate aldol addition product, but the specified heat drives the reaction to the final condensed product, A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
