    "The problem asks to identify compound X (C11H12O) which, upon reaction with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) in a nonpolar solvent at elevated temperature, yields a product with the given 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra. This reaction is an isomerization, as the product's molecular formula remains C11H12O.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the reaction product from the NMR data.**\n\nThe provided spectral data for the product are:\n*   **1H NMR:** δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).\n*   **13C NMR:** δ 21.3, 28.4, 126.9 (2C), 127.1, 129.1 (2C), 130.3, 141.5, 144.1, 197.7.\n\nLet's analyze the spectra to deduce the product's structure:\n1.  **13C NMR:** The signal at δ 197.7 ppm is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon, specifically a ketone conjugated with a double bond or an aromatic ring.\n2.  **1H NMR Aromatic Region:** The two doublets at δ 7.08 (2H) and δ 7.71 (2H) strongly suggest a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring.\n3.  **1H NMR Methyl Region:** There are two sharp singlets at δ 2.28 (3H) and δ 2.31 (3H). This indicates two methyl groups that are not coupled to any adjacent protons. One is likely attached to the aromatic ring (a tolyl group), and the other is likely an acetyl methyl group (-C(=O)CH3). The chemical shifts are consistent with this assignment.\n4.  **1H NMR Olefinic Region:** The two doublets at δ 6.75 (1H) and δ 7.68 (1H) are characteristic of two protons on a carbon-carbon double bond (vinylic protons) that are coupled to each other. Their high chemical shifts suggest they are part of a conjugated system with the carbonyl group and the aromatic ring.\n\nAssembling these pieces, the product structure is **(E)-4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n*   The *p*-tolyl group (CH3-C6H4-) accounts for the *para*-substituted pattern and one methyl singlet (~δ 2.31 ppm and δ 7.08/7.71 ppm).\n*   The acetyl group (-C(=O)CH3) accounts for the ketone carbon (δ 197.7 ppm) and the other methyl singlet (~δ 2.28 ppm).\n*   The trans double bond (-CH=CH-) accounts for the two vinylic proton doublets (δ 6.75 and δ 7.68 ppm).\n*   The molecular formula of this product is C11H12O, which matches that of the starting material, Compound X.\n\n**Product Structure:**\n```\n      O\n      ||\nCH3 - C - CH = CH - (p-tolyl ring) - CH3\n```\nThis is (E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the reaction type and deduce the structure of Compound X.**\n\nThe reaction is an isomerization of Compound X (C11H12O) to (E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one, catalyzed by DABCO, a non-nucleophilic base. The options for compound X are all epoxides. The reaction is a base-catalyzed rearrangement of an epoxide to a ketone. Specifically, it is a Meinwald rearrangement. Research shows that DABCO mediates the rearrangement of terminal epoxides substituted with aryl or vinyl groups specifically into methyl ketones.\n\nThe general transformation is:\nR-CH(O)CH2 (a terminal epoxide) → R-C(=O)CH3 (a methyl ketone)\n\nIn our case, the product is a methyl ketone where R = `p-Me-C6H4-CH=CH-`. Therefore, the starting material, Compound X, must be the corresponding terminal epoxide:\n`p-Me-C6H4-CH=CH-CH(O)CH2`\n\n**Step 3: Match the deduced structure of Compound X with the given options.**\n\nLet's examine the options:\n*   **A) 2-styrylepoxide:** The name is ambiguous, and the likely formula C10H10O does not match.\n*   **B) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** The \"4-methylstyryl\" group is `p-Me-C6H4-CH=CH-`. This is attached to the C2 position of an oxirane (epoxide) ring. This gives the structure `p-Me-C6H4-CH=CH-CH(O)CH2`. This structure is a terminal epoxide and has the correct molecular formula, C11H12O. This perfectly matches the precursor required to form the identified product via a Meinwald rearrangement.\n*   **C) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** This would rearrange to a ketone without a *p*-tolyl group, and the NMR data would be different.\n*   **D) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** This is an internal epoxide (`PhCH=CH-CH(O)CH-CH3`), not a terminal one. Its rearrangement would not yield the specific methyl ketone product identified from the NMR spectra.\n\nTherefore, Compound X is 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n<<<B>>>"
