    "Here is the step-by-step derivation for how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with parallax, assuming a uniform distribution of stars in the sky.\n\n1.  **Fundamental Relationships**\n    *   **Uniform Star Distribution:** We assume that, on a large scale, stars are distributed uniformly throughout space. This means the number of stars per unit volume is a constant. Let's call this constant density ρ.\n    *   **Parallax and Distance:** The parallax of a star (plx) is inversely proportional to its distance (r) from the observer. The relationship is given by `r = 1/plx`.\n\n2.  **Counting Stars in a Volume**\n    *   Consider a sphere of radius *r* centered on the observer. The volume of this sphere is `V = (4/3)πr³`.\n    *   Since the star density (ρ) is constant, the total number of stars (*N*) within this sphere is the density multiplied by the volume: `N = ρ * V = ρ * (4/3)πr³`.\n\n3.  **From Distance to Parallax**\n    *   We want to know how the number of stars relates to parallax, not distance. We can substitute the distance-parallax relationship (`r = 1/plx`) into our equation for the number of stars:\n        `N(plx) = ρ * (4/3)π * (1/plx)³ = (4/3)πρ / plx³`\n    *   This equation gives the total number of stars with a parallax *greater than or equal to* a certain value `plx` (which corresponds to all stars within a distance *r*).\n\n4.  **Finding the Number of Stars per Unit of Parallax**\n    *   The question asks for the *number of stars per unit range of parallax*, which is the rate of change of the number of stars with respect to parallax. This is mathematically represented by the derivative `dN/d(plx)`.\n    *   We differentiate the expression for N(plx) with respect to plx:\n        `dN/d(plx) = d/d(plx) [ (4/3)πρ * plx⁻³ ]`\n        `dN/d(plx) = (4/3)πρ * (-3 * plx⁻⁴)`\n        `dN/d(plx) = -4πρ / plx⁴`\n\n5.  **Interpreting the Result**\n    *   The negative sign simply indicates that as parallax increases (i.e., distance decreases), the cumulative number of enclosed stars decreases, which makes sense. We are interested in the magnitude or the number density of stars in a given parallax interval.\n    *   The number of stars per unit range of parallax is therefore proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n\nThis means that if you count stars in intervals of parallax of the same size, the number of stars you find in each interval will decrease very rapidly as the parallax value increases (which corresponds to observing stars that are closer and closer to us).\n\n<<<D>>>"
