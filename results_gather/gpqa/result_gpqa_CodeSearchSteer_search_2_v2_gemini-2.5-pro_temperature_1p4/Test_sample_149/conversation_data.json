    "The step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identification of the Starting Material:**\n    The molecular formula is C8H9NO. The 1H-NMR data provides the following information:\n    *   **9.72 (t, 1H):** This chemical shift and splitting pattern (triplet) is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n    *   **6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, strongly suggest a para-substituted benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is typical for a primary amine group (-NH2).\n    *   **3.66 (d, 2H):** This doublet corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-) that is coupled to the aldehyde proton, confirming the -CH2-CHO fragment.\n\n    Assembling these pieces gives the structure **2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal**. The degrees of unsaturation for C8H9NO are 5, which is consistent with a benzene ring (4) and a carbonyl group (1).\n\n2.  **Reaction with NaNO2 + HCl and H2O:**\n    *   The first step, reacting a primary aromatic amine with sodium nitrite (NaNO2) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) at low temperatures, is a **diazotization reaction**. This converts the amino group (-NH2) into a diazonium salt group (-N2+Cl-).\n    *   The second step involves adding water (H2O) and typically warming the solution. This causes the hydrolysis of the diazonium salt, replacing the -N2+ group with a hydroxyl group (-OH) and releasing nitrogen gas.\n    *   The product after these two steps is **2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal**, also known as p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n\n3.  **Reaction with aq. KOH and Heat:**\n    *   This final step involves treating 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal with aqueous potassium hydroxide (a strong base) and heat. These are the classic conditions for an **aldol condensation**.\n    *   The aldehyde has acidic α-protons (the protons on the -CH2- group). The hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH removes an α-proton to form an enolate.\n    *   This enolate then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon of another molecule of 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal. This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is the aldol addition product. The structure of this intermediate is 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal (Option C).\n    *   However, the reaction is carried out with **heat**. The presence of heat promotes a dehydration (or condensation) step. The aldol addition product readily loses a molecule of water (the -OH from the β-carbon and the -H from the α-carbon) to form a more stable, conjugated system.\n    *   The elimination of water results in the formation of an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This matches its known synthesis from the self-condensation of p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the reaction sequence is the aldol condensation product, not just the aldol addition product.\n\n<<<D>>>"
