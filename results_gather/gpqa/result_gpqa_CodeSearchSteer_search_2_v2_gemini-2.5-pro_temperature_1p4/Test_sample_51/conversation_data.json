    "The search results confirm my methodology.\n\n1.  **Boltzmann Equation**: The ratio of the population of two energy levels (N₂/N₁) in a gas in thermal equilibrium is given by the Boltzmann equation. The form I used is correct:\n    N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T))\n    The sources confirm that this is applicable to stellar atmospheres, which are assumed to be in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE).\n\n2.  **Ratio of Ratios**: My derivation for the factor by which the ratio changes is also correct.\n    Factor = Ratio_NoSpots / Ratio_Spots = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1 / T_spots - 1 / T_nospots) ]\n    The statistical weights (g₂/g₁) cancel out, so they are not needed for the final calculation.\n\n3.  **Energy Calculation**: The energy difference (ΔE) can be calculated from the photon's wavelength (λ) using the formula E = h * c / λ.\n\n4.  **Constants**: The values for the physical constants I used are confirmed by the search results.\n    *   Planck's constant (h) ≈ 4.136 x 10⁻¹⁵ eV·s.\n    *   Boltzmann constant (k) ≈ 8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K.\n    *   The product h*c is often approximated as 12400 eV·Å or 1.24 eV·µm for quick calculations.\n\nLet's redo the calculation with the confirmed values to ensure accuracy.\n\n-   **Temperatures**:\n    -   T_nospots = 6000 K\n    -   T_spots = 5500 K\n\n-   **Energy Difference (ΔE)**:\n    -   λ = 1448 Å\n    -   ΔE = hc / λ\n    -   Using the convenient approximation ΔE (eV) ≈ 12400 / λ (Å):\n    -   ΔE ≈ 12400 / 1448 ≈ 8.5635 eV\n\n-   **Boltzmann Constant (k)**:\n    -   k ≈ 8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K\n\n-   **Calculate the exponent**:\n    -   Exponent = (ΔE / k) * (1 / T_spots - 1 / T_nospots)\n    -   Exponent = (8.5635 / (8.617 x 10⁻⁵)) * (1/5500 - 1/6000)\n    -   Exponent ≈ 99379 * ((6000 - 5500) / (5500 * 6000))\n    -   Exponent ≈ 99379 * (500 / 33,000,000)\n    -   Exponent ≈ 99379 * (1 / 66000)\n    -   Exponent ≈ 1.5057\n\n-   **Calculate the factor**:\n    -   Factor = exp(1.5057)\n    -   Factor ≈ 4.507\n\nThe calculation is robust and consistently yields a value of approximately 4.5. The question states the ratio *decreases* when spots are present, which is consistent with the calculation. The temperature drops from 6000K to 5500K, and since temperature is in the denominator of a negative exponent, a lower temperature results in a smaller ratio of N₂/N₁, meaning fewer atoms in the higher energy state. Therefore, the ratio (No Spots / Spots) should be greater than 1, which it is.\n\nThe irrelevant data (stellar radius, mass, percentage of spot coverage) does not affect the calculation because the effective temperatures for both scenarios are provided directly.\n\nThe result aligns perfectly with option C.\n\nFinal check of the question: \"What is the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots?\" This asks for the ratio R_nospots / R_spots, which is what I have calculated.\n\nThe calculation is sound, the physical principles are confirmed, and the result matches one of the options precisely. I am ready to give the final answer. To solve this problem, we need to use the Boltzmann equation, which describes the relative populations of two energy levels in a system in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). The equation is given by:\n\nN₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T))\n\nWhere:\n*   N₂ and N₁ are the number of atoms in the upper (2) and lower (1) energy levels, respectively.\n*   g₂ and g₁ are the statistical weights of the levels.\n*   E₂ - E₁ (or ΔE) is the energy difference between the levels.\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nWe are asked to find the factor by which this ratio changes, which is the ratio without spots (R_nospots) divided by the ratio with spots (R_spots).\n\n**Step 1: Define the ratios for both conditions.**\nLet T_nospots = 6000 K be the temperature without spots, and T_spots = 5500 K be the temperature with spots.\n\n*   Ratio without spots: R_nospots = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots))\n*   Ratio with spots: R_spots = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots))\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the factor of change.**\nThe factor is R_nospots / R_spots:\n\nFactor = [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)) ] / [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots)) ]\n\nThe term with the statistical weights (g₂ / g₁) cancels out:\n\nFactor = exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots))\nFactor = exp [ (-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)) - (-ΔE / (k * T_spots)) ]\nFactor = exp [ (ΔE / k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) ]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the energy difference (ΔE).**\nThe energy of the transition is related to its wavelength (λ) by the formula ΔE = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light.\n\n*   h ≈ 4.1357 x 10⁻¹⁵ eV·s.\n*   c ≈ 2.998 x 10¹⁸ Å/s (since λ is in Ångstroms).\n*   λ = 1448 Å.\n\nA useful shortcut for this calculation is the formula ΔE (in eV) ≈ 12400 / λ (in Å).\n\nΔE ≈ 12400 / 1448 Å ≈ 8.5635 eV\n\n**Step 4: Plug the values into the factor equation.**\nWe have:\n*   ΔE ≈ 8.5635 eV\n*   k ≈ 8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K.\n*   T_spots = 5500 K\n*   T_nospots = 6000 K\n\nFirst, let's calculate the terms inside the exponent:\n*   ΔE / k ≈ 8.5635 eV / (8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K) ≈ 99379 K\n*   (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) = (1/5500 - 1/6000) = (6000 - 5500) / (5500 * 6000) = 500 / 33,000,000 = 1 / 66,000 K⁻¹\n\nNow, multiply these terms to get the full exponent:\nExponent ≈ 99379 K * (1 / 66,000 K⁻¹) ≈ 1.5057\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final factor.**\nFactor = exp(1.5057) ≈ 4.507\n\nThis value is approximately 4.5. Comparing this result with the given options, the closest one is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
