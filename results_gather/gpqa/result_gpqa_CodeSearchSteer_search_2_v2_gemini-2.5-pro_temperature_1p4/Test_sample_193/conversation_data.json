    "To determine the partition function, Z, for the system of three spins (S1, S2, S3), we must sum the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE), over all possible states of the system. Each spin can take a value of +1 or -1, resulting in 2^3 = 8 possible microstates. The energy, E, for each state is given by the equation E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3].\n\nThe calculation proceeds by first identifying the energy and degeneracy of all possible spin configurations:\n\nThere are two main energy levels for this system:\n\n**Energy Level 1:**\n*   **Configurations:**\n    *   All spins up: (S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1)\n    *   All spins down: (S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1)\n*   **Energy Calculation:**\n    *   For (+1, +1, +1): E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1)] = -3J\n    *   For (-1, -1, -1): E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -3J\n*   **Degeneracy (g1):** There are **2** states with an energy of -3J.\n\n**Energy Level 2:**\n*   **Configurations:** This level includes all states where two spins are aligned in one direction and the third is in the opposite direction.\n    *   Two spins up, one down: (+1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, +1), (-1, +1, +1)\n    *   One spin up, two spins down: (+1, -1, -1), (-1, +1, -1), (-1, -1, +1)\n*   **Energy Calculation:** For any of these six configurations, the product of the spins (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3) will always result in -1.\n    *   For example, for (+1, +1, -1): E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = J\n    *   For example, for (+1, -1, -1): E = -J[(1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[-1 -1 + 1] = J\n*   **Degeneracy (g2):** There are **6** states with an energy of J.\n\nThe partition function Z is the sum over all energy levels of their degeneracy multiplied by the corresponding Boltzmann factor.\nZ = Σᵢ gᵢ * e^(-βEᵢ)\n\nSubstituting the calculated energies and degeneracies:\nZ = (g₁ * e^(-βE₁)) + (g₂ * e^(-βE₂))\nZ = (2 * e^(-β(-3J))) + (6 * e^(-β(J)))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result to the given options, it matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
