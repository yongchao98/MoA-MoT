    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the chemical riddle:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K (3.85 °C). The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This is a strong indication that substance **B is heavy water**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Heavier Isotope and Substance X:** Since B is D₂O, the heavy isotope involved is deuterium (D), an isotope of hydrogen. The clue that substance X and its analog are common reagents in organic chemistry points towards Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄). Its widely used, non-deuterated analog is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄), a powerful reducing agent.\n\n3.  **Identify Liquid Y and Gas W:** Substance X (LiAlD₄) \"reacts violently with liquid Y\" releasing gas W \"whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n    *   The reaction of LiAlD₄ with heavy water (D₂O) is violent and produces deuterium gas (D₂).\n    *   A molecule of deuterium gas (D₂) consists of two deuterium atoms. Each deuterium atom has one proton and one neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, fitting the description of gas W.\n    *   This confirms that **liquid Y is heavy water (D₂O)** and **gas W is deuterium gas (D₂) **.\n\n4.  **Identify Precipitate G:** The reaction is: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂. The precipitate formed, G, is aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, analogous to the gelatinous precipitate aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃. When aluminum hydroxide is heated, it decomposes to aluminum oxide and water. Similarly, heating G (Al(OD)₃) releases B (D₂O), which is consistent with the clues.\n\n5.  **Confirm with the Keto Acid Reaction:** The final clue states that the reaction product of a keto acid with substance X contains 2 oxygen atoms. LiAlH₄ (and thus LiAlD₄) is a strong reducing agent known to reduce both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols. The resulting product, a diol, would contain two oxygen atoms. This supports the identification of X as LiAlD₄.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Mass:** The final step is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   **Elements in LiAlD₄:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (atomic number Z=1).\n    *   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminum (atomic number Z=13).\n    *   The problem states that if multiple instances of an element exist, their masses must be summed.\n    *   **Mass of the Lightest Element (Hydrogen):** There are four atoms of the deuterium isotope (D or ²H). The mass number of deuterium is 2. Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n    *   **Mass of the Heaviest Element (Aluminum):** There is one atom of aluminum. The stable and most abundant isotope is ²⁷Al, with a mass number of 27. Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n    *   **Cumulative Mass:** 8 (from 4 Deuterium atoms) + 27 (from 1 Aluminum atom) = 35.\n\nThus, the cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<D>>>"
