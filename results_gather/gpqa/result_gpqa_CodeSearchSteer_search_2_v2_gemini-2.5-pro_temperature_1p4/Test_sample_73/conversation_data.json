    "The problem asks for the probability of a single atomic nucleus decaying within a specific future time frame, given that it has already survived for a certain period. This is a classic problem involving the principles of radioactive decay.\n\n### The Memoryless Nature of Radioactive Decay\n\nRadioactive decay is a stochastic process governed by the exponential distribution. A key feature of this process is that it is \"memoryless\". This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed. In other words, an atom does not \"age\". The fact that the atom has survived for 50 minutes does not alter its intrinsic probability of decaying in any subsequent period.\n\n### Calculation Steps\n\nTo solve the problem, we first need to determine the decay constant (λ), which represents the probability per unit time for a single nucleus to decay.\n\n1.  **Find the decay constant (λ):**\n    We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%. The probability of decay, P(decay), is related to the decay constant λ and time *t* by the formula:\n    *P(decay) = 1 - e^(-λt)*\n\n    Given P(decay in 100 min) = 0.32, we have:\n    0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)\n\n    First, solve for e^(-λ * 100):\n    e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32\n    e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68\n\n    Now, solve for λ by taking the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n    -100λ = ln(0.68)\n    λ = -ln(0.68) / 100\n    λ ≈ -(-0.3857) / 100\n    λ ≈ 0.003857 per minute\n\n2.  **Calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes:**\n    Now we use the calculated decay constant to find the probability of decay in a 150-minute interval. As noted, the 50 minutes that have already passed are irrelevant to this future probability.\n\n    *P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)*\n\n    Substitute the value of λ:\n    *P(decay) = 1 - e^(-0.003857 * 150)*\n    *P(decay) = 1 - e^(-0.57855)*\n\n    Calculate the value of the exponential term:\n    e^(-0.57855) ≈ 0.5607\n\n    Finally, calculate the decay probability:\n    *P(decay) = 1 - 0.5607*\n    *P(decay) = 0.4393*\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n    The probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 0.4393, which is 43.93%. This value is closest to 44%.\n\n<<<A>>>"
