    "To identify the mutation most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, it is crucial to understand the effect of each genetic change on the final protein product. The goal is to find the mutation that most severely disrupts the gene's ability to produce a functional protein.\n\n### Analysis of the Gene and Mutations:\n\nThe intact gene sequence begins with 5'-ATG..., which is the standard start codon for protein synthesis. The final codon is TGA, which is a stop codon, signaling the end of translation. The protein's function—in this case, synthesizing an anti-nutritional compound—is determined by the sequence of amino acids coded between the start and stop signals.\n\nLet's analyze the codons (three-letter DNA sequences) at the beginning of each sequence:\n*   **Intact gene:** 5’-**ATG TTT CTC** GCT...-3’\n    *   This translates to the amino acid sequence: **Met - Phe - Leu...**\n*   **Mutant 1:** 5’-**ATG TTC TAC** GCT...-3’\n    *   The second codon, TTT, has changed to TTC. Both TTT and TTC code for the amino acid Phenylalanine (Phe). This is a *silent mutation*.\n    *   The third codon, CTC (Leucine), has changed to TAC (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, which changes a single amino acid in the protein. While a missense mutation can sometimes affect a protein's function, it does not guarantee the complete elimination of its activity.\n*   **Mutant 2:** 5’-**ATG TTC TAA** GCT...-3’\n    *   The third codon, CTC (Leucine), has been changed to **TAA**. TAA is a **stop codon** (also known as a nonsense codon). This type of change is called a **nonsense mutation**.\n    *   A nonsense mutation prematurely terminates protein synthesis, leading to a truncated (shortened) and typically non-functional protein. Since this stop codon appears very early (at the third position), the resulting protein would consist of only two amino acids, making it almost certain to be inactive.\n*   **Mutant 3:** 5’-**ATG TTT TAC** GCT GGT **GTC**...-3’\n    *   This mutant has two changes. The third codon, CTC (Leucine), is changed to TAC (Tyrosine), and the sixth codon, ACT (Threonine), is changed to GTC (Valine).\n    *   These are two separate **missense mutations**. While changing two amino acids increases the likelihood of disrupting the protein's function compared to changing only one, it is still less severe than a premature stop codon.\n*   **Mutant 4:** 5’-**ATG TTT TAC** GCT **ACT**...-3’\n    *   Comparing this sequence to the intact one reveals that the codon GGT (Glycine) has been deleted.\n    *   This deletion causes a **frameshift mutation**. The reading frame for all subsequent codons is altered, leading to a completely different amino acid sequence downstream and likely encountering a premature stop codon. Frameshift mutations are severely disruptive.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nAmong the given options, both a nonsense mutation and a frameshift mutation are highly likely to eliminate protein function. However, the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a definitive stop signal at the very beginning of the protein. This guarantees the production of a severely truncated, non-functional peptide. For this reason, it is the most probable mutation to successfully eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nTherefore, Mutant 2 presents the most effective \"knockout\" of the target gene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
