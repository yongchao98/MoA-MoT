    "The problem asks for the joint probability of measuring the z-components of the orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, of two electrons and finding the eigenvalues to both be $-\\hbar$.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the physics involved:\n\n1.  **System State**: The two-electron system is in a coupled angular momentum state described by the quantum numbers $|l, m\\rangle = |2, -1\\rangle$. This means the total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$, and the quantum number for its projection onto the z-axis is $m=-1$. The individual electrons are in p-orbitals, so their orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$.\n\n2.  **Measurement**: A measurement of the individual z-components of angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, is performed. The possible outcomes of such a measurement are the eigenvalues of these operators, which are $m_{l1}\\hbar$ and $m_{l2}\\hbar$. We are specifically interested in the outcome where both eigenvalues are $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to the quantum numbers $m_{l1} = -1$ and $m_{l2} = -1$.\n\n3.  **Conservation of Angular Momentum**: A fundamental principle in quantum mechanics is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. This is expressed as:\n    $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$\n    The corresponding quantum numbers must also add up:\n    $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$\n\n4.  **Probability Calculation**: The state of the system is $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$. This is an eigenstate of the total angular momentum operators $L^2$ and $L_z$. When we measure $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, the system is projected onto an eigenstate of these individual operators, denoted by $|l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2}\\rangle$. The probability of a particular outcome $(m_{l1}, m_{l2})$ is given by the square of the absolute value of the inner product (or projection) of the initial state onto the final measured state. However, for this projection to be non-zero, the sum of the individual z-component quantum numbers must equal the total z-component quantum number of the initial state.\n\nIn this specific problem:\n*   The initial state has a total magnetic quantum number $m = -1$.\n*   The desired measurement outcome corresponds to $m_{l1} = -1$ and $m_{l2} = -1$.\n\nLet's check the conservation rule:\n$m_{l1} + m_{l2} = (-1) + (-1) = -2$\n\nThe sum of the z-components for the desired outcome ($m_{total} = -2$) does not match the z-component of the system's initial state ($m = -1$). Because the z-component of the total angular momentum must be conserved, it is impossible to measure $m_{l1}=-1$ and $m_{l2}=-1$ when the system is in a state with $m=-1$.\n\nTherefore, the probability of this measurement outcome is zero. This is because the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, which describes the projection of the coupled state onto the uncoupled basis state, is zero when $m \\neq m_{l1} + m_{l2}$.\n\n<<<B>>>"
