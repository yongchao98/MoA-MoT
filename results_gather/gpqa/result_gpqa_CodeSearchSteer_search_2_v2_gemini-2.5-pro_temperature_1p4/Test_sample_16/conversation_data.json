    "This is a classic chemistry equilibrium problem. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1.  **Reaction and Formation Constant (Kf):** The Ca-EDTA complex is formed by the reaction of a calcium ion (Ca²⁺) with the EDTA ligand (Y⁴⁻). The complex is very stable, as indicated by its high formation constant (Kf). The formation reaction is:\n    Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ CaY²⁻ (where CaY²⁻ represents the Ca-EDTA complex)\n\n    The formation constant expression is:\n    K_f = [CaY²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰.\n\n2.  **Dissociation of the Complex:** The question asks for the free calcium ion concentration in a solution that starts with 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. The complex will slightly dissociate back into its constituent ions:\n    CaY²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n\n3.  **Setting up the Equilibrium Calculation:** We can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to track the concentrations. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ that forms from the dissociation.\n\n    *   **Initial:** [CaY²⁻] = 0.02 M; [Ca²⁺] = 0 M; [Y⁴⁻] = 0 M\n    *   **Change:** [CaY²⁻] = -x; [Ca²⁺] = +x; [Y⁴⁻] = +x\n    *   **Equilibrium:** [CaY²⁻] = 0.02 - x; [Ca²⁺] = x; [Y⁴⁻] = x\n\n    The problem states an \"ideal pH,\" which simplifies the calculation by ensuring that all dissociated EDTA is in the fully deprotonated Y⁴⁻ form, which is the species that binds to calcium.\n\n4.  **Solving the Equation:** Now, substitute the equilibrium concentrations back into the formation constant expression:\n    K_f = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n    5 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / x²\n\n    Since K_f is extremely large, the dissociation (x) will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex. This allows for a simplifying assumption:\n    0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\n    The equation becomes:\n    5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\n    Now, solve for x, which represents the equilibrium concentration of Ca²⁺ ions:\n    x² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\n    x² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n    x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\n    x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of free calcium ions in the solution is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<B>>>"
