    "### Analysis of Tautomerism and Optical Isomerism\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\nTautomerism is a form of isomerism where a molecule can exist in two or more interconvertible structures, known as tautomers. A common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group) for the interconversion to occur.\n\n*   **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** The structure of p-benzoquinone consists of a six-membered ring with two ketone groups and two carbon-carbon double bonds. The carbon atoms adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the double bonds and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached. Without an alpha-hydrogen, benzoquinone cannot undergo standard keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has ketone groups at the 1, 3, and 5 positions of a cyclohexane ring. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 each have two hydrogen atoms. These are alpha-hydrogens, situated between two carbonyl groups, which makes them particularly acidic and available for tautomerization. Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can tautomerize to its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). This enol form is exceptionally stable because it is an aromatic compound, which provides significant resonance stabilization.\n\nTherefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality in organic molecules is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The chemical formula is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. The central carbon atom (C2) is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    1.  a methyl group (–CH₃)\n    2.  a hydroxyl group (–OH)\n    3.  a hydrogen atom (–H)\n    4.  a methoxycarbonyl group (–COOCH₃)\n    Since it has a carbon atom attached to four different groups, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate contains a chiral center and thus exhibits optical isomerism, existing as L and D isomers.\n\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the ester groups are in a *trans* configuration across the carbon-carbon double bond. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the double bond. Molecules with a plane of symmetry are achiral and cannot be optically active. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism.\n\nThus, the compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nCombining these findings:\n*   Compound (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
