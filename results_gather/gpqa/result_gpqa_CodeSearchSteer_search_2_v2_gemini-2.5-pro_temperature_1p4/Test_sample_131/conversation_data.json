    "To solve this problem, we must determine the ¹H NMR spectral characteristics for each of the four candidate compounds and then see which 1:1 mixture aligns with the provided spectral data.\n\n### **Analysis of Each Compound's Predicted ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nFirst, we will predict the number of signals, their splitting patterns (singlet, doublet, etc.), and the relative proton integrations for each molecule.\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a high degree of symmetry. There are two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a single signal.\n        *   **Aromatic Signal:** 1 singlet (integrating to 2H).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** Due to symmetry, all four methyl groups are equivalent.\n        *   **Alkyl Signal:** 1 singlet (integrating to 12H).\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the methyl groups at positions 2 and 5.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** This symmetry makes the two aromatic protons at positions 4 and 6 equivalent. They are not adjacent to any other protons.\n        *   **Aromatic Signal:** 1 singlet (integrating to 2H).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups are in three distinct chemical environments:\n        *   The methyls at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyl at C2 is unique (3H).\n        *   The methyl at C5 is unique (3H).\n        *   **Alkyl Signals:** 3 singlets with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are adjacent to each other. They will couple and split each other's signals.\n        *   **Aromatic Signals:** 2 doublets (each integrating to 1H). This compound can be eliminated as the problem states only singlets are observed in the aromatic region.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyls at C1 and C4 are equivalent, and the methyls at C2 and C3 are equivalent.\n        *   **Alkyl Signals:** 2 singlets (each integrating to 6H).\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four aromatic protons are equivalent.\n        *   **Aromatic Signal:** 1 singlet (integrating to 4H).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The protons of the ethyl groups will show characteristic splitting (a quartet for the CH₂ and a triplet for the CH₃).\n        *   **Alkyl Signals:** 1 quartet (4H) and 1 triplet (6H). This compound can also be eliminated because the problem states only singlets are observed in the alkyl region.\n\n### **Evaluating the Mixture**\n\nThe experimental data for the 1:1 mixture shows:\n*   **Aromatic region:** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Alkyl region:** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nBased on the individual analyses, we can eliminate **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** (produces doublets) and **1,4-diethylbenzene** (produces a quartet and a triplet). This eliminates options A, B, and D.\n\nThe only remaining possibility is Option C, a mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**. Let's verify if a 1:1 mixture of these two compounds matches the data.\n\n*   **Compound 1: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Aromatic: 1 singlet (2H)\n    *   Alkyl: 1 singlet (12H)\n*   **Compound 2: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Aromatic: 1 singlet (2H)\n    *   Alkyl: 3 singlets (6H, 3H, 3H in a 2:1:1 ratio)\n\n**Combined Spectrum of a 1:1 Mixture:**\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:** Each compound produces one singlet, and each integrates to 2 protons. Assuming they have slightly different chemical shifts, the mixture would show **two singlets**, each corresponding to 2H. The ratio of their integrations would be 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This perfectly matches the description.\n*   **Alkyl Region:** We would expect to see the signals from both compounds.\n    *   From 1,2,4,5-TMB: one singlet of intensity 12H.\n    *   From 1,2,3,5-TMB: three singlets of intensity 6H, 3H, and 3H.\n    *   The problem states only three signals are seen, in a 2:1:1 ratio. This indicates an accidental overlap of signals. If the two singlets that both integrate to 3H from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene are not resolved or happen to have the same chemical shift, they would appear as a single peak with an integration of 6H.\n    *   This would result in three total alkyl signals with integrations of 12H, 6H, and (3H+3H)=6H.\n    *   The ratio of these signals is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the description.\n\nTherefore, the mixture contains 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>"
