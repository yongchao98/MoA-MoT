    "The reaction of racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst is an olefin self-metathesis reaction. The racemic starting material is an equal mixture of (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene and (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene. The Grubbs catalyst, being achiral, will facilitate the reaction without preference for either enantiomer.\n\nThe metathesis reaction will produce ethene (which is to be excluded from the count) and a dimer, 4,5-dimethyloct-4-ene. Due to the racemic nature of the starting material, three types of dimerization will occur:\n1.  Reaction of two (R)-enantiomers: (R) + (R)\n2.  Reaction of two (S)-enantiomers: (S) + (S)\n3.  Cross-reaction between (R) and (S) enantiomers: (R) + (S)\n\nFor each of these pairings, we must consider the geometry of the newly formed double bond, which can be either *E* (trans) or *Z* (cis).\n\n**1. Products from (R) + (R) reaction:**\nThis pairing produces (4R,5R)-4,5-dimethyloct-4-ene. Both E and Z isomers are possible.\n*   (E)-(4R,5R)-4,5-dimethyloct-4-ene\n*   (Z)-(4R,5R)-4,5-dimethyloct-4-ene\nThese two products are diastereomers of each other.\n\n**2. Products from (S) + (S) reaction:**\nThis pairing produces (4S,5S)-4,5-dimethyloct-4-ene. Again, both E and Z isomers are possible.\n*   (E)-(4S,5S)-4,5-dimethyloct-4-ene\n*   (Z)-(4S,5S)-4,5-dimethyloct-4-ene\nThese two products are the enantiomers of the corresponding (R,R) products. For instance, (E)-(4S,5S) is the enantiomer of (E)-(4R,5R).\n\n**3. Products from (R) + (S) cross-reaction:**\nThis pairing produces (4R,5S)-4,5-dimethyloct-4-ene. We must analyze the stereochemistry of its E and Z isomers.\n*   **(E)-(4R,5S)-4,5-dimethyloct-4-ene:** This molecule possesses a center of inversion, which makes it an achiral meso compound.\n*   **(Z)-(4R,5S)-4,5-dimethyloct-4-ene:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the double bond and reflects one half of the molecule onto the other. This symmetry element also makes it an achiral meso compound.\n\n**Counting the total number of unique products:**\nFrom the three reaction pathways, we generate the following distinct stereoisomers:\n*   From (R)+(R): 2 products ((E)-RR and (Z)-RR)\n*   From (S)+(S): 2 products ((E)-SS and (Z)-SS), which are the enantiomers of the RR products.\n*   From (R)+(S): 2 products (the meso E-isomer and the meso Z-isomer), which are diastereomeric to each other and to the other products.\n\nIn total, the number of possible products is 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n\nThe six possible products are:\n1.  (E)-(4R,5R)-4,5-dimethyloct-4-ene\n2.  (E)-(4S,5S)-4,5-dimethyloct-4-ene\n3.  (Z)-(4R,5R)-4,5-dimethyloct-4-ene\n4.  (Z)-(4S,5S)-4,5-dimethyloct-4-ene\n5.  (E)-(4R,5S)-4,5-dimethyloct-4-ene (meso)\n6.  (Z)-(4R,5S)-4,5-dimethyloct-4-ene (meso)\n\n<<<C>>>"
