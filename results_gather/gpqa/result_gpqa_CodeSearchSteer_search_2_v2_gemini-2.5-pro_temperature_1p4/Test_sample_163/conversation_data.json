    "To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we can use the principles of orbital mechanics for binary stars. The total mass of a spectroscopic binary system is related to its orbital period (P) and the amplitudes of the radial velocities (K) of its components.\n\n### Analysis Steps:\n\n1.  **Fundamental Formula**: For a double-lined spectroscopic binary, the total mass (M = M₁ + M₂) can be derived from Kepler's third law. The formula that connects the total mass to the observable quantities is:\n    M = [P / (2πG)] * [(K₁ + K₂)³ / sin³(i)]\n    where:\n    *   `M` is the total mass of the system.\n    *   `P` is the orbital period.\n    *   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n    *   `K₁` and `K₂` are the amplitudes of the radial velocities of the two stars.\n    *   `i` is the inclination of the orbit to the line of sight.\n\n2.  **Simplification for Eclipsing Binaries**: The problem states that both systems are eclipsing. For eclipses to occur, the orbital inclination `i` must be very close to 90 degrees. This means sin(i) is approximately 1, and therefore sin³(i) is also approximately 1. This is a standard and crucial simplification for eclipsing binary systems.\n\n3.  **Mass Ratio Calculation**: We want to find the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (M_sys1) to the total mass of system_2 (M_sys2). Using the simplified formula, we have:\n    *   M_sys1 ∝ P₁ * (K₁ₐ + K₁ₑ)³\n    *   M_sys2 ∝ P₂ * (K₂ₐ + K₂ₑ)³\n\n    The ratio M_sys1 / M_sys2 is therefore:\n    M_sys1 / M_sys2 = [P₁ * (K₁ₐ + K₁ₑ)³] / [P₂ * (K₂ₐ + K₂ₑ)³]\n\n4.  **Plugging in the Values**: Let's substitute the given data into the ratio formula.\n\n    **For System 1:**\n    *   Period (P₁) = 2 years\n    *   Sum of velocity amplitudes (K₁ₐ + K₁ₑ) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n    **For System 2:**\n    *   Period (P₂) = 1 year\n    *   Sum of velocity amplitudes (K₂ₐ + K₂ₑ) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**:\n    *   M_sys1 / M_sys2 = (2 / 1) * (15 / 25)³\n    *   M_sys1 / M_sys2 = 2 * (3 / 5)³\n    *   M_sys1 / M_sys2 = 2 * (27 / 125)\n    *   M_sys1 / M_sys2 = 54 / 125\n    *   M_sys1 / M_sys2 = 0.432\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately 0.432. Comparing this to the given options, the closest value is 0.4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
