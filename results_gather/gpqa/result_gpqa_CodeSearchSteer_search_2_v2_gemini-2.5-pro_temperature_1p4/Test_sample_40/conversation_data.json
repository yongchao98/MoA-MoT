    "The search results confirm my initial derivation.\n\n*   **The Problem:** The core of the question is to find the speed of light in a moving medium as seen by a stationary observer. This phenomenon is famously demonstrated in the Fizeau experiment.\n*   **Key Physics Principle:** The correct way to calculate this is using the relativistic formula for the addition of velocities. This formula is a fundamental consequence of Einstein's theory of special relativity.\n*   **Frames of Reference and Velocities:**\n    *   Let the laboratory be the stationary frame (S).\n    *   Let the moving glass be the moving frame (S').\n    *   The speed of light within the glass, as measured in the glass's own rest frame (S'), is `u' = c/n`. Given `c=1`, this becomes `u' = 1/n`.\n    *   The velocity of the glass (frame S') relative to the lab (frame S) is `v`.\n*   **Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:** For collinear motion (where all velocities are along the same line), the formula is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'v / c^2)`\n    where `u` is the velocity observed in the lab frame.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  Substitute the known values into the formula, with `c=1`:\n        `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n)*v / 1^2 )`\n    2.  Simplify the expression:\n        `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + v/n )`\n    3.  Multiply the numerator and denominator by `n` to clear the fractions within the expression:\n        `u = n * ( (1/n) + v ) / n * ( 1 + v/n )`\n        `u = ( 1 + n*v ) / ( n + v )`\n\nThis result matches my initial derivation and is confirmed by the search results. It shows that the observed speed is not a simple addition (`v + 1/n`) but is corrected by the denominator term `(1 + v/n)`, a key feature of special relativity.\n\nComparing the final expression with the given options:\nA) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\nB) 1\nC) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\nD) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n\nThe calculated speed matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
