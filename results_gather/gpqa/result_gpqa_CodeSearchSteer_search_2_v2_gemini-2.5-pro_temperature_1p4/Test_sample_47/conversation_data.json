    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of product 4 and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone was treated with bromine, forming product 1.**\nThis reaction is the acid-catalyzed α-halogenation of a ketone. Cyclohexanone reacts with bromine (Br₂) to form 2-bromocyclohexanone as product 1.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 was heated with sodium hydroxide, forming product 2.**\nThe reaction of an α-halo ketone, like 2-bromocyclohexanone, with a base such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is known as the Favorskii rearrangement. This reaction involves a ring contraction. The six-membered ring of 2-bromocyclohexanone contracts to form a five-membered ring derivative. The product of this rearrangement is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid, which is product 2.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 was treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine, forming product 3.**\nCyclopentanecarboxylic acid (product 2) is a carboxylic acid. Its reaction with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride. Therefore, product 3 is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 was treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride, forming product 4.**\nProduct 3, cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride, is an acyl chloride. Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃) is a mild reducing agent that selectively reduces reactive acyl chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to an alcohol. This means product 4 is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: How many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms?**\n\nProduct 4 is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\nThe structure of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (CHO) and the carbon of the ring it is attached to (C1). This plane bisects the bond between C3 and C4 of the cyclopentane ring. Due to this symmetry, we can identify the following sets of chemically non-equivalent hydrogens:\n*   **The aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This single proton is in a unique chemical environment. (1 signal)\n*   **The proton on C1:** The hydrogen attached to the same carbon as the aldehyde group is also unique. (1 signal)\n*   **The protons on C2 and C5:** These two carbons are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, on each of these carbons, the two protons are diastereotopic (not equivalent to each other). This results in two distinct signals for the four protons on C2 and C5. (2 signals)\n*   **The protons on C3 and C4:** Similarly, these two carbons are equivalent. The two protons on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic. This gives another two distinct signals for the four protons on C3 and C4. (2 signals)\n\nCounting these up: 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (C1) + 2 (C2/C5) + 2 (C3/C4) = 6 chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms.\n\nTherefore, product 4 has 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<A>>>"
