    "To solve this problem, we first need to determine the initial and final states of the molecule and then calculate the energy difference between them. This energy difference will be equal to the energy of the absorbed photon.\n\n### 1. Identify the Energy Levels and Transition\nThe energy of a state in the quantum rotation-vibration model is given by:\nE(v, J) = (v + ½)ħω + Bħ²J(J+1)\n\nWhere:\n*   `v` is the vibrational quantum number (v = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n*   `J` is the rotational quantum number (J = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n*   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration.\n*   `B` is the rotational constant.\n\nThe **fundamental state** (or ground state) is the state with the lowest possible energy, which corresponds to `v=0` and `J=0`.\nE_initial = E(0, 0) = (0 + ½)ħω + 0 = ½ħω\n\nThe \"next state with the lowest possible energy\" requires an absorption of a photon. For rovibrational transitions in most diatomic molecules, the selection rules are Δv = +1 and ΔJ = ±1. Since the molecule starts at J=0, a transition to J=-1 is not possible. Therefore, the only allowed transition is ΔJ = +1.\n\nSo, the final state must have:\n*   v_final = v_initial + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1\n*   J_final = J_initial + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1\n\nThis corresponds to the transition from the (v=0, J=0) state to the (v=1, J=1) state. The energy of this final state is:\nE_final = E(1, 1) = (1 + ½)ħω + Bħ²(1)(1+1) = ³/₂ħω + 2Bħ²\n\n### 2. Calculate the Energy of the Absorbed Photon (ΔE)\nThe energy of the absorbed photon is the difference between the final and initial energy states.\nΔE = E_final - E_initial\nΔE = (³/₂ħω + 2Bħ²) - (½ħω)\nΔE = ħω + 2Bħ²\n\nTo calculate this energy, we need to find the values of ħω and 2Bħ².\n\n*   **Vibrational Energy Term (ħω):**\n    ħ ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n    ω = 4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s\n    ħω = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s) = 4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n\n*   **Rotational Energy Term (2Bħ²):**\n    This term can also be expressed as ħ² / I, where `I` is the moment of inertia.\n    I = μR²\n    First, we calculate the reduced mass (μ).\n    m_X = 20 amu\n    m_Y = 2 amu\n    1 amu ≈ 1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n    μ = (m_X * m_Y) / (m_X + m_Y) = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) amu = 40/22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu\n    μ ≈ 1.818 * (1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) ≈ 3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n\n    Now, calculate the moment of inertia (I).\n    R = 2 angstroms = 2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n    I = μR² ≈ (3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)² ≈ 1.2076 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n\n    Now, we can find the rotational energy term.\n    2Bħ² = ħ² / I ≈ (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (1.2076 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²) ≈ 9.21 x 10⁻²³ J\n\n*   **Total Energy (ΔE):**\n    ΔE = (4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J) + (9.21 x 10⁻²³ J) ≈ 4.225 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n\n### 3. Calculate the Photon's Momentum (p)\nThe energy of a photon (E) is related to its momentum (p) and the speed of light (c) by the equation E = pc.\np = ΔE / c\n\nWhere:\n*   c ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s\n*   p = (4.225 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (3 x 10⁸ m/s)\n*   p ≈ 1.408 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n\nThis value is very close to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
