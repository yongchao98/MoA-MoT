    "### Reaction Analysis\n\nThe reaction described is a classic Diels-Alder cycloaddition.\n\n1.  **Dienophile Identification**: A *cis*-dicarboxylic acid was dehydrated to an anhydride. The resulting anhydride shows a single proton peak at 7 ppm and two carbon peaks at 137 ppm (vinylic) and 165 ppm (carbonyl). This spectroscopic data is characteristic of **maleic anhydride** (C₄H₂O₃). The two vinylic protons are chemically equivalent, as are the two vinylic carbons and the two carbonyl carbons, consistent with the observed NMR spectra.\n\n2.  **Diene Identification**: The diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene** (C₉H₁₄).\n\n3.  **Reaction and Products**: The Diels-Alder reaction between maleic anhydride and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene yields an adduct with the molecular formula C₁₃H₁₆O₃ (C₄H₂O₃ + C₉H₁₄). Due to the stereochemistry of the cycloaddition, two diastereomeric products can be formed: the *endo* and *exo* adducts. The Diels-Alder reaction is under kinetic control, and secondary orbital overlap stabilizes the *endo* transition state, making the **endo adduct the major product** and the **exo adduct the minor product**.\n\n### NMR and NOESY Analysis\n\nThe question hinges on identifying a cross-peak in the 2D NOESY spectrum that is present for the major product but absent for the minor product. A NOESY cross-peak indicates that two protons are close in space (typically < 5Å).\n\n*   **Major (Endo) Product**: In the *endo* conformation, the anhydride portion of the molecule is situated \"under\" the newly formed cyclohexene ring. This geometry brings the two protons from the original maleic anhydride (let's call them **H_alkane**) very close to the two methyl groups on the double bond (the \"inner\" methyls, **Me_inner**).\n*   **Minor (Exo) Product**: In the *exo* conformation, the anhydride portion is flipped away from the cyclohexene ring. In this arrangement, the **H_alkane** protons are far from the **Me_inner** groups.\n\nTherefore, a NOESY cross-peak between the **H_alkane** protons and the **Me_inner** protons will be strong in the major (*endo*) product and absent or very weak in the minor (*exo*) product. This is the key distinguishing feature.\n\n### Chemical Shift Predictions\n\nTo match this interaction with the given options, we must predict the signals for these protons in the ¹H NMR spectrum:\n\n1.  **H_alkane protons**: These are two equivalent protons on carbons adjacent to carbonyl groups within a strained bicyclic system. They have no adjacent protons to couple with (the bridgehead carbons are quaternary, each bearing a methyl group). Thus, they will appear as a **2H singlet**. Their position alpha to two carbonyls places their chemical shift significantly downfield, reasonably at **~3.5 ppm**.\n\n2.  **Me_inner protons**: These are the two methyl groups attached directly to the C=C double bond in the product. They are equivalent by symmetry. Vinylic methyl groups typically resonate in the range of 1.6-2.2 ppm. They would appear as a **6H singlet**. A chemical shift of **~1.7 ppm** is appropriate.\n\n3.  **Other Protons**:\n    *   **Me_outer protons**: The two methyl groups at the bridgehead carbons are on saturated, quaternary centers. They would be a **6H singlet** at a more shielded (upfield) position, around **~1.0 ppm**.\n    *   **H_bridge protons**: The two protons on the CH₂ bridge are diastereotopic and would likely appear as two distinct **1H doublets** (due to geminal coupling).\n\n### Matching Predictions to Options\n\nWe are looking for the NOESY cross-peak connecting **H_alkane** and **Me_inner**. Based on our predictions:\n\n*   **H_alkane**: 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n*   **Me_inner**: 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\n\nThis corresponds directly to option C.\n\n*   A) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_bridge and H_alkane)\n*   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_outer and Me_inner)\n*   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (Me_inner and H_alkane)**\n*   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (Me_outer and H_bridge)\n\nThe interaction described in option C is the most characteristic NOE for assigning the *endo* stereochemistry in this type of Diels-Alder adduct.\n\n<<<C>>>"
