    "The provided google search results confirm the physical principles used in the initial reasoning.\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature**: The formula for equilibrium temperature (T_eq) relates it to the star's properties (Radius R_star, Temperature T_star) and the planet's orbital distance (a) and albedo (A). Several sources show the relationship T_eq ∝ (1/a)^(1/2) assuming the albedo and stellar properties are constant. For a planet on a circular orbit, the distance 'r' is constant and equal to the semi-major axis 'a'. The formula is T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2a))^(1/2) * (1-A)^(1/4). Since T_star, R_star, and A are the same for all three planets, the ratio between the equilibrium temperatures of two planets (i and j) simplifies to T_eq_i / T_eq_j = (a_j / a_i)^(1/2). My initial step was correct.\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law**: Multiple sources confirm that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a). For planets orbiting the same star, this gives the relationship (P_i / P_j)^2 = (a_i / a_j)^3. This also matches my initial reasoning.\n\n3.  **TTV and Mass Information**: The search results on Transit Timing Variation (TTV) explain that TTV is a method used to detect additional planets and determine their masses by observing variations in transit times caused by gravitational perturbations. The information about TTV and the planet masses is context about how the system was discovered and characterized. It is not needed for the calculation requested, which relies on the relationship between temperature, distance, and period. The problem implicitly assumes the planets' masses are negligible compared to the star's mass, a standard assumption in basic applications of Kepler's Third Law.\n\nThe initial calculation steps are sound and based on confirmed physical laws. No new information from the search results contradicts the initial plan. I can proceed to finalize the answer based on the calculation.\n\n**Calculation Recap:**\n\n1.  **Find the ratio of semi-major axes (a) from the temperature (T_eq) ratios:**\n    *   T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 1.4  =>  a2 / a1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2)^2 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96\n    *   T_eq2 / T_eq3 = 2.3  =>  a3 / a2 = (T_eq2 / T_eq3)^2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29\n\n2.  **Calculate the overall ratio of the semi-major axes a3 to a1:**\n    *   a3 / a1 = (a3 / a2) * (a2 / a1) = 5.29 * 1.96 = 10.3684\n\n3.  **Use Kepler's Third Law to find the ratio of orbital periods (P):**\n    *   P3 / P1 = (a3 / a1)^(3/2)\n    *   P3 / P1 = (10.3684)^(1.5) ≈ 33.384\n\nThe result is approximately 33.4, which corresponds to option C.\n\nFinal check of the question and my understanding.\n- 3 exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, Planet3)\n- Circular orbits\n- T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 1.4\n- T_eq2 / T_eq3 ≈ 2.3\n- Equal albedo (A=0.3)\n- Find P3 / P1\n\nThe logic holds. T1 > T2 > T3 means the planets are progressively farther from the star (a1 < a2 < a3), and thus their periods should also be progressively longer (P1 < P2 < P3). The calculated ratio P3/P1 is ~33.4, which is > 1, consistent with this logic. The other information (TTV discovery, mass ratios) is extraneous to the calculation itself. The solution is robust.\nTo solve this problem, we need to connect the equilibrium temperature of a planet to its orbital period. This involves two key physical principles: the formula for planetary equilibrium temperature and Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion.\n\n### Step 1: Relate Equilibrium Temperature to Orbital Distance\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet in a circular orbit is determined by the balance between the energy absorbed from its star and the energy it radiates away. The formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\nWhere:\n*   T_star is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   R_star is the radius of the star.\n*   `a` is the orbital distance (semi-major axis for a circular orbit).\n*   `A` is the planet's albedo (the fraction of light it reflects).\n\nThe problem states that all three planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo (A = 0.3). Therefore, for any two planets (i and j) in the system, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures is:\n\n(T_eq_i / T_eq_j) = [(a_j / a_i)]^(1/2)\n\nThis can be rearranged to find the ratio of their orbital distances:\n\n(a_j / a_i) = (T_eq_i / T_eq_j)^2\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Ratios of Orbital Distances\n\nUsing the given temperature ratios, we can calculate the ratios of the orbital distances.\n\n*   **For Planet1 and Planet2:**\n    We are given T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 1.4.\n    Therefore, the ratio of their orbital distances is:\n    a2 / a1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96\n\n*   **For Planet2 and Planet3:**\n    We are given T_eq2 / T_eq3 ≈ 2.3.\n    Therefore, the ratio of their orbital distances is:\n    a3 / a2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29\n\nTo find the ratio of the orbital distance of Planet3 to Planet1 (a3 / a1), we can multiply the two ratios we just found:\n\na3 / a1 = (a3 / a2) * (a2 / a1) = 5.29 * 1.96 = 10.3684\n\n### Step 3: Use Kepler's Third Law to Find the Orbital Period Ratio\n\nKepler's Third Law states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a). For two planets orbiting the same star, the relationship is:\n\n(P_i / P_j)^2 = (a_i / a_j)^3\n\nThis means the ratio of the periods is:\n\n(P_i / P_j) = (a_i / a_j)^(3/2)\n\nWe want to find the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, which is the ratio P3 / P1. Using the ratio a3 / a1 that we calculated:\n\nP3 / P1 = (a3 / a1)^(3/2) = (10.3684)^(3/2)\n\nLet's calculate the final value:\n\nP3 / P1 ≈ 33.384\n\nThis value is approximately 33.4.\n\nThe information about the planets' masses and their discovery via the Transit Timing Variation (TTV) method is extra context and not required for this specific calculation, which relies on the fundamental relationships between temperature, distance, and period.\n\nComparing our result to the given options:\nA) ~ 10.4\nB) ~ 3.2\nC) ~ 33.4\nD) ~ 4.4\n\nOur calculated value of ~33.4 matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
