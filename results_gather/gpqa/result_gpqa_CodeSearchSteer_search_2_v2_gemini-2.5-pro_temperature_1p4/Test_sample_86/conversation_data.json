    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Molecular Formula and Features:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This is a benzene ring (C₆) with two substituents. The base structure is -C₆H₄-.\n    *   **8 carbon atoms in total:** The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, leaving 2 carbons for the substituents.\n    *   **Carbonyl group (C=O):** One of the substituents contains a carbonyl group.\n    *   **Aromatic-halogen bond:** A halogen atom (like Cl, Br, I) is directly attached to the aromatic ring.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure of the Substituents:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X).\n    *   The other substituent must contain 2 carbons and a carbonyl group. The most common and stable group that fits this description is an **acetyl group** (-COCH₃).\n    *   Therefore, the compound is a haloacetophenone. The molecular formula is X-C₆H₄-COCH₃. This structure has 8 carbons, a carbonyl group, and an aromatic-halogen bond as required.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Positional Isomers (ortho, meta, para):**\n    *   The problem provides NMR data options that will help us determine the substitution pattern. Options A and B both show a `(2H, d)` and another `(2H, d)` pattern in the aromatic region (7-8 ppm). This is a classic pattern for a **para (1,4) disubstituted** benzene ring. The symmetry of the para-isomer means there are only two types of aromatic protons, and they split each other into doublets.\n    *   Ortho and meta isomers would show more complex splitting patterns with four distinct signals for the four aromatic protons.\n\n4.  **Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for the a para-Haloacetophenone:**\n    *   The structure is `p-X-C₆H₄-COCH₃`.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** We expect two signals, each integrating to 2 protons (2H), appearing as doublets (d) in the chemical shift range of 6.5-8.0 ppm.\n    *   **Acetyl Protons:** The methyl group (-CH₃) is attached to a carbonyl. These 3 protons are not adjacent to any other protons, so they will appear as a singlet (s). The typical chemical shift for protons on a carbon next to a carbonyl (alpha-protons) is around 2-3 ppm.\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:** Two doublets in the 7-8 ppm range (2H each) and one singlet at ~2.3 ppm (3H).\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Given Options:**\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum corresponds to a para-substituted aromatic aldehyde (`p-X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO`). The peak at 9.9 ppm is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). While this structure also has 8 carbons and fits the other descriptions, the other signals do not match our primary deduction.\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum perfectly matches our prediction for `p`-haloacetophenone. It shows the two doublets for the para-substituted aromatic protons and a 3H singlet at 2.3 ppm for the acetyl methyl group.\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   This data does not show the expected signals for an aromatic ring in the 7-8 ppm region and has an incorrect number of protons in the signals.\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This data also lacks the characteristic aromatic proton signals.\n\n**Conclusion:** The compound is a para-haloacetophenone. The 1H NMR data in option B, showing two doublets for the 4 aromatic protons and a singlet for the 3 acetyl protons, correctly describes this structure.\n\n<<<B>>>"
