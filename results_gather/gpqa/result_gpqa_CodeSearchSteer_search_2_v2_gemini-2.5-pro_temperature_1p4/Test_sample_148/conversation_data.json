    "Based on the provided analytical data, the most likely explanation is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers. Here is a detailed analysis of the observations and why this conclusion is the most logical.\n\n### Analysis of the Observations\n\n*   **Two α-Proton Peaks in ¹H NMR:** The spectrum shows two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton. Since they sum to the expected integral of one proton and spin-spin coupling has been ruled out, this indicates the proton exists in two different chemical environments.\n*   **Two Peaks in LC-MS:** The liquid chromatography (LC) resolves the crude mixture into two separate peaks of equal intensity. This demonstrates that there are two distinct compounds that interact differently with the chromatography column.\n*   **Identical Mass Spectra:** Both peaks from the LC have the same mass spectrum, which matches the expected mass of the synthesized peptide. This confirms that the two compounds are isomers (they have the same molecular formula) and not an impurity like a precursor, which would have a different mass.\n\n### Evaluation of the Options\n\n*   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) analytical environment, they have identical physical and chemical properties. Therefore, they would not produce separate peaks in a standard LC system and would be indistinguishable in a standard NMR spectrum, showing only a single set of peaks. To separate enantiomers, a chiral stationary phase in the LC or a chiral resolving agent in the NMR would be required, neither of which were mentioned. This option is inconsistent with the data.\n\n*   **B) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor from the synthesis would be a different molecule with a different chemical formula and therefore a different mass. The LC-MS data, showing both peaks have the same mass as the target molecule, directly refutes this possibility.\n\n*   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. Unlike enantiomers, they have different physical properties and can be distinguished by standard analytical techniques.\n    *   **NMR:** Diastereomers will have different chemical shifts for corresponding protons, explaining the two alpha-proton peaks.\n    *   **LC-MS:** Because of their different physical properties, diastereomers can be separated on a standard (achiral) chromatography column, which accounts for the two peaks seen in the LC analysis. Their identical mass spectra are also consistent, as diastereomers have the same molecular formula.\n    *   **Source in Peptides:** A common way diastereomers form during chemical peptide synthesis is through racemization (or epimerization) of an amino acid's alpha-carbon. If one chiral center in a peptide containing multiple chiral centers inverts, the resulting molecule is a diastereomer of the original. This often occurs during the amino acid activation and coupling steps and can lead to a roughly 1:1 mixture, which aligns with the observation of two peaks of equal intensity. Another source of diastereomers in complex peptides is atropisomerism, where hindered rotation around a bond creates stable, separable isomers. Both racemization and atropisomerism result in a mixture of diastereomers, making this the most plausible explanation.\n\n*   **D) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This would mean an extra amino acid was added to the peptide chain. The resulting molecule would have a significantly different (and higher) mass than the expected product. This is contradicted by the MS data.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe observation of two separable isomers with identical mass but distinct NMR signals and LC retention times is the classic signature of a diastereomeric mixture.\n\n<<<C>>>"
