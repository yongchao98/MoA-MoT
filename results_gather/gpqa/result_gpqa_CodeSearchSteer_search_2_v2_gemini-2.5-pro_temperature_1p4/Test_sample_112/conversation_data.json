    "To identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound, we must analyze the data from each characterization technique.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data:\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. This broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between molecules.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls squarely in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Coupled with the broad O-H peak, this strongly suggests a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH), which typically shows a C=O stretch between 1760-1690 cm⁻¹.\n    *   A strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the compound is an alkene.\n\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond. Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a double bond and typically appear in the 4.5 to 7 ppm region of the NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a classic indicator of a carboxylic acid. This fragment corresponds to the carboxylonium ion, [COOH]⁺.\n\n### Deduction of the Chemical Formula:\n\n1.  The combined evidence from FTIR (broad O-H and C=O peaks) and Mass Spectrometry (m/z = 45 fragment) conclusively points to the presence of a carboxylic acid group. A carboxylic acid requires two oxygen atoms, which immediately eliminates options A (C6H10O) and B (C6H12O).\n\n2.  The evidence from FTIR (C=C stretch at 1650 cm⁻¹) and 1H NMR (vinyl hydrogens) confirms the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond.\n\n3.  Now, we must use the concept of **degrees of unsaturation** (DoU) to distinguish between the remaining options, C) C6H12O2 and D) C6H10O2. The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula is:\n    DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)\n\n    *   For **C) C6H12O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1. A single degree of unsaturation would be accounted for by the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid. This formula represents a *saturated* carboxylic acid and does not account for the C=C double bond.\n\n    *   For **D) C6H10O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2. Two degrees of unsaturation perfectly match our findings: one degree for the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid and a second degree for the C=C bond.\n\n**Conclusion:** The spectral data indicates the compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid. The only formula that fits all the evidence is C6H10O2, which has the two oxygen atoms required for a carboxylic acid and the correct number of hydrogens to account for two degrees of unsaturation (one C=O and one C=C bond).\n\n<<<D>>>"
