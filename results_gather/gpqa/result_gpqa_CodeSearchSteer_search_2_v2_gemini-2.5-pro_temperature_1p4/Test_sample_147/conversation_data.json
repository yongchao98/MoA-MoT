    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to identify substance A4 and its molecular weight.\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y using the Mass Percentage of A2.**\n    Let the formula of substance A2 be YFₙ. The mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) is given by the formula:\n    ɷF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F))\n    We are given ɷF = 31.96% (or 0.3196) and the molar mass of fluorine, M(F), is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n    0.3196 = (n × 19.00) / (M(Y) + n × 19.00)\n    Rearranging for M(Y), the molar mass of element Y, we get:\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n    We can test integer values for n (the oxidation state of Y) to find a plausible element Y.\n    *   If n=1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (similar to Ca or Sc, which do not form five fluorides).\n    *   If n=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (similar to Br, but its fluorides don't match other clues).\n    *   If n=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is very close to the molar mass of **Iodine (I)**, which is 126.9 g/mol. This is a strong candidate.\n    *   If n=4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (no common element fits well).\n    *   If n=5, M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (similar to Au, M=197.0 g/mol). This is another possibility.\n    *   If n=6, M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (similar to Pu, M=244 g/mol).\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Iodine (Y=I) Hypothesis.**\n    If Y is Iodine and n=3, then substance **A2 is IF₃** (Iodine trifluoride). Iodine is known to form several binary fluorides, including IF, IF₃, IF₅, and IF₇. The existence of five compounds as stated in the problem is plausible if dimers or unstable species are included.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance A1.**\n    The problem states that the bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (IF₃) and fluorine gas (F₂). This decomposition (A1 → IF₃ + F₂) implies A1 is a higher fluoride of iodine.\n    Let's test A1 = IF₅. The reaction would be IF₅ → IF₃ + F₂. This is a chemically sound decomposition.\n    The description of A1 as \"bright-red\" is inconsistent with pure IF₅, which is a colorless liquid. This is likely an inaccuracy in the problem statement, as the other chemical clues for the Iodine path are consistent. A1 being a strong oxidizer that reacts with xenon is also true for iodine fluorides.\n\n4.  **Identify Substances A4 and A5.**\n    The crucial clue is: \"By adding Y (Iodine) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n    *   **A4**: The solution of A4 is colorless. Of the known iodine fluorides, IF₅ and IF₇ are colorless, while IF₃ is yellow and IF is unstable. Therefore, A4 is likely IF₅ or IF₇.\n    *   **The Reaction**: Y + A4 → A5 is a comproportionation reaction, where iodine in its elemental state (oxidation state 0) reacts with an iodine fluoride of a higher oxidation state.\n    *   Let's test **A4 = IF₅**. The reaction with iodine (Y) is:\n        I + IF₅ → 2IF₃\n    This reaction is balanced and proceeds in a 1:1 molar ratio of I atoms to IF₅ molecules. The product formed is IF₃.\n    *   **A5**: The product of the reaction is **A5 = IF₃**.\n    *   **Final Check**: The problem states A5 decomposes in water. IF₃ reacts vigorously with water to form hydrofluoric acid and iodic acid, fitting the description.\n\n5.  **Determine the Molecular Weight of A4.**\n    Based on the analysis, substance A4 is Iodine pentafluoride (IF₅).\n    Molecular Weight (MW) of IF₅ = M(I) + 5 × M(F)\n    MW(IF₅) = 126.9 g/mol + 5 × 19.0 g/mol\n    MW(IF₅) = 126.9 + 95.0\n    MW(IF₅) = 221.9 g/mol\n\n6.  **Select the Correct Range.**\n    The calculated molecular weight of 221.9 g/mol falls within the range of 220-240.\n\n<<<C>>>"
