    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Aperture:** The problem describes an N-sided polygon where all apothems are of the same length 'a'. As the number of sides, N, becomes infinitely large, a regular polygon approaches a circle. The apothem 'a' becomes the radius of this circle.\n\n2.  **Identify the Physics Phenomenon:** When light passes through an aperture, it diffracts. For observations in the \"far field region,\" we use Fraunhofer diffraction theory. The diffraction pattern for a circular aperture is a series of concentric bright and dark rings, known as an Airy pattern.\n\n3.  **Locate the Intensity Minima:** The intensity distribution for Fraunhofer diffraction from a circular aperture of radius 'a' involves a first-order Bessel function, J₁(x). The minima (dark rings) of the diffraction pattern occur at the zeros of this Bessel function. The condition for the minima is given by:\n    `k * a * sin(θ) = x_n`\n    where:\n    *   `k` is the wave number (2π / λ).\n    *   `a` is the radius of the aperture.\n    *   `θ` is the angular position of the minimum.\n    *   `x_n` are the roots (zeros) of the Bessel function J₁(x).\n\n4.  **Apply the Small Angle Approximation:** The problem states that we can use the small angle approximation, so `sin(θ) ≈ θ`. The formula becomes:\n    `(2π / λ) * a * θ_n = x_n`\n    Rearranging for the angular position of the nth minimum, `θ_n`:\n    `θ_n = (x_n * λ) / (2π * a)`\n\n5.  **Find the Zeros of the Bessel Function:** The minima of the diffraction pattern correspond to the zeros of the J₁ Bessel function. We need the first two non-zero roots:\n    *   First zero (x₁): ≈ 3.8317\n    *   Second zero (x₂): ≈ 7.0156\n\n6.  **Calculate the Angular Positions of the First Two Minima:**\n    *   The angular position of the first minimum (θ₁) is:\n        `θ₁ = (3.8317 * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ 0.6098 * λ / a`\n    *   The angular position of the second minimum (θ₂) is:\n        `θ₂ = (7.0156 * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ 1.1168 * λ / a`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Angular Distance Between the Minima:** The question asks for the \"angular distance between the first two minima.\" This is the difference between the angular positions of the second and the first minimum.\n    *   `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`\n    *   `Δθ ≈ (1.1168 * λ / a) - (0.6098 * λ / a)`\n    *   `Δθ ≈ 0.507 * λ / a`\n\n8.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) 0.610 λ / a (This is the position of the first minimum, `θ₁`)\n    *   B) 1.220 λ / a (This is twice the position of the first minimum, `2θ₁`, which would be the angular diameter of the central bright spot, also known as the Airy disk)\n    *   C) 0.506 λ / a (This matches our calculated angular separation, `Δθ`)\n    *   D) 0.500 λ / a\n\nThe calculation based on the positions of the first two minima yields a result that matches option C. Textbooks and academic sources confirm the locations of the minima for a circular aperture. For instance, the positions are given by sin(θ) = 1.22λ/D, 2.23λ/D, and so on, where D is the diameter (D=2a). This is equivalent to `θ = 0.61λ/a` and `θ = 1.115λ/a`. The difference between these two is `0.505λ/a`, which confirms the result.\n\nTherefore, the angular distance between the first and second minima is approximately 0.506 λ / a.\n\n<<<C>>>"
