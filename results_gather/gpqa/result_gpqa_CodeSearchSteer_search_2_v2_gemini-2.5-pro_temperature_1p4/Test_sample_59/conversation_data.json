    "To determine the time that passes for the astronaut, we must use the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\n**1. Determine the Distance and Earth-Time:**\nThe destination is Earth, and the journey begins from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The distance to the LMC is approximately 160,000 to 163,000 light-years. For this calculation, we will use the commonly cited distance of approximately 160,000 light-years.\n\nFirst, we calculate the travel time from the perspective of an observer on Earth:\n*   **Time (Earth)** = Distance / Speed\n*   Time (Earth) ≈ 160,000 light-years / (0.99999987 * c)\n*   Time (Earth) ≈ 160,000.02 years\n\n**2. Calculate the Time Dilation Effect:**\nTime dilation describes how time passes more slowly for a moving object relative to a stationary observer. The formula for time dilation is:\n\nt' = t * √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nWhere:\n*   **t'** is the time experienced by the astronaut (proper time).\n*   **t** is the time measured by the observer on Earth.\n*   **v** is the velocity of the spacecraft (0.99999987 * c).\n*   **c** is the speed of light.\n\nAlternatively, we can calculate the Lorentz factor (γ) first:\n\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\nγ = 1 / √(1 - (0.99999987c)²/c²)\nγ = 1 / √(1 - 0.99999974)\nγ = 1 / √0.00000026\nγ ≈ 1 / 0.0005099\nγ ≈ 1961.17\n\nThen, we find the time experienced by the astronaut:\n*   **Time (astronaut)** = Time (Earth) / γ\n*   Time (astronaut) ≈ 160,000.02 years / 1961.17\n*   Time (astronaut) ≈ 81.58 years\n\n**3. Final Age and Conclusion:**\nThe journey will take approximately 81.58 years from the astronaut's perspective. The astronaut's age upon arrival would be:\n*   Age on arrival = Initial Age + Travel Time\n*   Age on arrival = 22 years + 81.58 years = 103.58 years\n\nSince the astronaut's age upon arrival (approximately 104 years) is less than their average lifespan of 150 years, the astronaut will survive the trip.\n\nComparing the calculated travel time of ~81.58 years to the given options, the closest answer is 81 years.\n\n<<<D>>>"
