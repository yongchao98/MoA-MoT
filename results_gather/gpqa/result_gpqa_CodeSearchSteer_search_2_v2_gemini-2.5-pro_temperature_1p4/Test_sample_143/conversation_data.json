    "To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate the proper lifetime (τ)** of the particle from its decay width (Γ).\n2.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ)** from the particle's energy and mass.\n3.  **Calculate the relativistic velocity (β)** of the particle.\n4.  **Calculate the mean decay distance (d)** in the laboratory frame.\n\nHere are the given values:\n*   Production energy (E_X) = 8 GeV = 8000 MeV\n*   Mass (m_X) = 1.2 GeV = 1200 MeV\n*   Width (Γ_X) = 320 MeV\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Proper Lifetime (τ)\n\nThe proper lifetime is related to the decay width by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The formula is:\nτ = ħ / Γ\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant. A useful value for the product of ħ and the speed of light, c, is ħc ≈ 197.327 MeV·fm.\n\nFirst, let's find the value of cτ:\ncτ = ħc / Γ_X\ncτ = (197.327 MeV·fm) / 320 MeV\ncτ ≈ 0.6166 fm (where 1 fm = 10⁻¹⁵ m)\n\nSo, cτ ≈ 0.6166 × 10⁻¹⁵ m.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)\n\nThe Lorentz factor is the ratio of the particle's total energy to its rest mass energy.\nγ = E_X / m_X\nγ = 8000 MeV / 1200 MeV\nγ = 20 / 3 ≈ 6.667\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Relativistic Velocity (β)\n\nThe relativistic velocity (β = v/c) can be calculated from the Lorentz factor:\nβ = √(1 - 1/γ²)\nβ = √(1 - 1/(20/3)²)\nβ = √(1 - 9/400)\nβ = √(391/400)\nβ ≈ 0.98868\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Mean Decay Distance (d)\n\nThe mean decay distance in the lab frame is the distance the particle travels, on average, before decaying. This distance is subject to relativistic effects, namely time dilation and length contraction. The formula for the decay length is L = γβcτ.\n\nd = γ * β * cτ\nd = (20/3) * √(391/400) * (0.6166 × 10⁻¹⁵ m)\nd = (20/3) * (√391 / 20) * (0.6166 × 10⁻¹⁵ m)\nd = (√391 / 3) * (0.6166 × 10⁻¹⁵ m)\nd ≈ (19.7737 / 3) * (0.6166 × 10⁻¹⁵ m)\nd ≈ 6.5912 * (0.6166 × 10⁻¹⁵ m)\nd ≈ 4.0645 × 10⁻¹⁵ m\n\nThis value is extremely close to option D. The minor difference is likely due to the precision of the constants used.\n\nTherefore, the mean decay distance is approximately 4.0655 × 10⁻¹⁵ m.\n\n<<<D>>>"
