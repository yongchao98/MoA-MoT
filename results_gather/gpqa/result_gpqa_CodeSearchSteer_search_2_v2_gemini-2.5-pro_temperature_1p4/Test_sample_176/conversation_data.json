    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star radiating as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    L = 4πR²σT⁴\n    where R is the star's radius, T is its surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n2.  **Luminosity Ratio:** We need to find the ratio of the luminosities of Star_1 (L₁) and Star_2 (L₂).\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴) = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n3.  **Radius Ratio:** The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2.\n    R₁ = 1.5 * R₂  =>  R₁/R₂ = 1.5\n    Therefore, (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25.\n\n4.  **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates a star's surface temperature (T) to the peak wavelength (λ_max) of its emitted spectrum in its rest frame.\n    λ_max * T = b (where b is Wien's displacement constant)\n    This means T = b / λ_max, or T is inversely proportional to the rest-frame peak wavelength.\n    So, the temperature ratio is:\n    T₁/T₂ = λ_max,rest₂ / λ_max,rest₁\n\n5.  **Doppler Effect on Wavelength:** The problem states that astronomers measured the wavelengths at which the stars *appeared* brightest and found them to be the same. This refers to the *observed* peak wavelength (λ_max,obs), which is affected by the star's radial velocity (v) due to the Doppler effect. The relationship between the observed wavelength and the rest-frame wavelength (λ_max,rest) is:\n    λ_max,obs = λ_max,rest * (1 + v/c)\n    where c is the speed of light. A positive velocity indicates the star is moving away (redshift).\n\n6.  **Calculating Rest-Frame Wavelengths:**\n    *   **For Star_1:** The radial velocity is v₁ = 0 km/s.\n        λ_max,obs₁ = λ_max,rest₁ * (1 + 0/c) = λ_max,rest₁\n    *   **For Star_2:** The radial velocity is v₂ = 700 km/s = 7 x 10⁵ m/s.\n        λ_max,obs₂ = λ_max,rest₂ * (1 + v₂/c)\n        So, λ_max,rest₂ = λ_max,obs₂ / (1 + v₂/c)\n\n7.  **Calculating Temperature Ratio:** We are given that the observed peak wavelengths are the same: λ_max,obs₁ = λ_max,obs₂.\n    Let's substitute the expressions for the rest-frame wavelengths into the temperature ratio equation from step 4:\n    T₁/T₂ = λ_max,rest₂ / λ_max,rest₁\n    T₁/T₂ = [λ_max,obs₂ / (1 + v₂/c)] / λ_max,obs₁\n    Since λ_max,obs₁ = λ_max,obs₂, they cancel out:\n    T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\n8.  **Final Calculation:** Now we substitute the radius ratio and the temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio formula from step 2.\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v₂/c)⁴\n\n    Now, let's plug in the values for v₂ and c (c ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s):\n    v₂/c = (7 x 10⁵ m/s) / (3 x 10⁸ m/s) ≈ 0.002333\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / 1.00937\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\n    This value is closest to 2.23. The information about the mass of the stars is extra data not needed for this calculation, acting as a distractor.\n\nThe luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.23.\n\n<<<A>>>"
