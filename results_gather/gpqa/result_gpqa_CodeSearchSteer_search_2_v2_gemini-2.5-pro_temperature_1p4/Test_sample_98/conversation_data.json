    "Based on the detailed analysis of the provided spectroscopic data, the unknown compound is identified by interpreting its key features in the FTIR and ¹H NMR spectra.\n\n### Spectroscopic Analysis\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** The presence of a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is a classic indicator of the O-H bond stretching in a carboxylic acid, with the broadness resulting from hydrogen bonding. The strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) bond stretching, also characteristic of a carboxylic acid. This confirms the functional group present in the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid, which is consistent with all four possible structures.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:** The ¹H NMR data provides the specific details needed to distinguish between the isomers. The absence of vinyl-protons indicates that there are no carbon-carbon double bonds in the molecule, which is true for all options. The crucial information lies in two complex splitting patterns observed for two different signals:\n    *   **Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This splitting pattern arises when a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons: a single proton (causing the doublet), a set of two equivalent protons (causing the triplet), and a set of three equivalent protons (causing the quartet).\n    *   **Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This pattern occurs when a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons: a single proton (causing the doublet), a set of two equivalent protons (causing the first triplet), and another, different set of two equivalent protons (causing the second triplet).\n\n### Structural Elucidation\n\nBy examining the four possible structures, we can predict the expected splitting patterns for their protons:\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (3,4-diethylhexanoic acid):** This molecule has a proton that would exhibit a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt) signal. However, it lacks a proton environment that would produce a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq).\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (3,4-dimethylhexanoic acid):** This structure has a proton that would result in a dtq signal but does not have one that would produce a dtt signal.\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid):** Similar to option B, a proton in this molecule would show a dtq signal, but none would produce a dtt signal.\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (interpreted as 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid):** Although the condensed structural formula is written in a non-standard way, it corresponds to the molecular formula C₉H₁₈O₂. The isomer that fits this formula and the NMR data is 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid:\n    ```\n       CH₃-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₂CH₃)-CH₂-COOH\n    ```\n    In this structure:\n    *   The proton on carbon-3, `–CH(CH₂CH₃)–`, is coupled to the proton on carbon-4 (1H, doublet), the adjacent methylene group in the ethyl substituent (2H, triplet), and the methylene group at carbon-2 (2H, triplet). This creates a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n    *   The proton on carbon-4, `–CH(CH₃)–`, is coupled to the proton on carbon-3 (1H, doublet), the adjacent methylene group on the main chain (2H, triplet), and the adjacent methyl group (3H, quartet). This creates a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n\nSince the structure corresponding to option D is the only one that can produce both of the described complex ¹H NMR signals, it is the correct identification for the unknown compound.\n\n<<<D>>>"
