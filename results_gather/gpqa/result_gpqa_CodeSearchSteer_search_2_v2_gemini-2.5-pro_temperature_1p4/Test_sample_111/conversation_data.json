    "Here is a step-by-by-step resolution of the problem:\n\n### 1. Normalize the State |alpha>\n\nThe given state is |alpha> ∝ (1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>. To make it a valid quantum state, we must normalize it. Let the normalized state be |alpha> = C * [(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>], where C is the normalization constant.\n\nThe normalization condition is <alpha|alpha> = 1.\nThe bra corresponding to |alpha> is <alpha| = C* * [(1-i) <up| + (2+i) <down|].\n\nSo, <alpha|alpha> = |C|² * [(1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i)] = 1.\n*   (1-i)(1+i) = 1² - i² = 1 - (-1) = 2\n*   (2+i)(2-i) = 2² - i² = 4 - (-1) = 5\n\nTherefore, |C|² * (2 + 5) = 1, which means |C|² * 7 = 1, and C = 1/√7.\n\nThe normalized state is:\n|alpha> = (1/√7) * [(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>]\n\nIn vector notation, with |up> = and |down> =, the state is:\n|alpha> = (1/√7) * [1+i, 2-i]\n\n### 2. Define the Operator Matrix A\n\nThe problem states that the elements of the operator A are Aij = hbar/2 if i ≠ j, and Aij = 0 if i = j. In the {|up>, |down>} basis, this gives the 2x2 matrix:\nA = [[A₁₁, A₁₂], [A₂₁, A₂₂]] = [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]\nThis can be written as A = (hbar/2) * σₓ, where σₓ is the Pauli X matrix.\n\n### 3. Find Eigenstates and Eigenvalues of A\n\nTo find the possible measurement outcomes, we need to find the eigenvalues of A.\nThe eigenvalue equation is det(A - λI) = 0.\ndet([[ -λ, hbar/2], [hbar/2, -λ]]) = (-λ)(-λ) - (hbar/2)(hbar/2) = λ² - (hbar²/4) = 0\nSo, λ² = hbar²/4, and the eigenvalues are λ₁ = +hbar/2 and λ₂ = -hbar/2.\n\nNext, we find the corresponding normalized eigenvectors (eigenstates).\n*   **For λ₁ = +hbar/2**:\n    (A - λ₁I)v₁ = 0\n    [[-hbar/2, hbar/2], [hbar/2, -hbar/2]] [a, b] = 0\n    This gives the equation -a + b = 0, so a = b. The eigenvector is proportional to.\n    Normalizing it gives the eigenstate |v₁> = (1/√2) * = (1/√2) * (|up> + |down>).\n\n*   **For λ₂ = -hbar/2**:\n    (A - λ₂I)v₂ = 0\n    [[hbar/2, hbar/2], [hbar/2, hbar/2]] [c, d] = 0\n    This gives the equation c + d = 0, so c = -d. The eigenvector is proportional to [1, -1].\n    Normalizing it gives the eigenstate |v₂> = (1/√2) * [1, -1] = (1/√2) * (|up> - |down>).\n\n### 4. Calculate Measurement Probabilities\n\nThe probability of measuring an eigenvalue λᵢ is given by P(λᵢ) = |<vᵢ|alpha>|².\n\n*   **Probability of measuring λ₁ = +hbar/2**:\n    <v₁|alpha> = [(1/√2) * (<up| + <down|)] * [(1/√7) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]\n    <v₁|alpha> = (1/√14) * [1*(1+i) + 1*(2-i)] = (1/√14) * (3)\n    P(λ₁) = |3/√14|² = 9/14 ≈ 0.643\n\n*   **Probability of measuring λ₂ = -hbar/2**:\n    <v₂|alpha> = [(1/√2) * (<up| - <down|)] * [(1/√7) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]\n    <v₂|alpha> = (1/√14) * [1*(1+i) - 1*(2-i)] = (1/√14) * (1+i-2+i) = (1/√14) * (-1+2i)\n    P(λ₂) = |(-1+2i)/√14|² = ((-1)² + 2²)/14 = (1+4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.357\n\nThe probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.\n\n### 5. Calculate the Average (Expectation) Value\n\nThe average or expectation value of the operator A is <A> = <alpha|A|alpha>.\n\n<A> = <alpha| A |alpha>\nA|alpha> = (hbar/2) * [,] * (1/√7) * [[1+i], [2-i]] = (hbar/(2√7)) * [[2-i], [1+i]]\n\n<alpha|A|alpha> = (1/√7) * [1-i, 2+i] * (hbar/(2√7)) * [[2-i], [1+i]]\n<A> = (hbar/14) * [(1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i)]\n<A> = (hbar/14) * [(2 - i - 2i + i²) + (2 + 2i + i + i²)]\n<A> = (hbar/14) * [(2 - 3i - 1) + (2 + 3i - 1)]\n<A> = (hbar/14) * [(1 - 3i) + (1 + 3i)]\n<A> = (hbar/14) * 2 = hbar/7\n\nAlternatively, the expectation value can be calculated using the probabilities and eigenvalues:\n<A> = Σ P(λᵢ) * λᵢ\n<A> = (9/14)*(+hbar/2) + (5/14)*(-hbar/2) = (hbar/28)*(9-5) = 4*hbar/28 = hbar/7.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value of the operator is hbar/7. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
