    "The phrase \"my compounds are on top of each other\" is common slang in a synthetic organic chemistry lab. It refers to the difficulty in separating two or more compounds because they have very similar physical properties, which prevents them from being resolved by a given separation technique.\n\nThe most common technique for separation and for monitoring the progress of a reaction is chromatography, especially Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC). Chromatography separates compounds based on their differential partitioning between a stationary phase (like silica gel on a TLC plate) and a mobile phase (a solvent). This partitioning is primarily governed by the polarity of the compounds.\n\nIf two compounds have very similar polarities, they will travel up the TLC plate at nearly the same rate, resulting in spots that are very close or even merged into a single spotâ€”literally appearing to be \"on top of each other.\" This indicates that separating the compounds using column chromatography with the same solvent system would be very difficult.\n\nLet's analyze the given options:\n*   **A) The compounds they are working with are bonding to each other through non-covalent/van der Waals interactions:** While these interactions are the basis for polarity, this statement is too general and is not the direct, practical meaning of the phrase in a lab context.\n*   **B) The compounds they are working with have similar optical rotations:** Optical rotation is a property used for characterization of chiral compounds, not a primary separation technique for a mixture.\n*   **C) The compounds they are working with have similar boiling points:** This would make separation by distillation difficult. While plausible, chromatography is a much more frequently used separation and analytical technique in a modern organic synthesis lab, and the phrase is most strongly associated with chromatographic failure.\n*   **D) The compounds they are working with have similar polarities:** This directly leads to poor separation in chromatography, the most common purification and analytical technique in this setting. The visual result on a TLC plate is overlapping spots, which perfectly matches the description \"on top of each other.\"\n\nTherefore, the chemist is most likely referring to the similar polarities of their compounds, which is causing them to co-elute during chromatography.\n\n<<<D>>>"
