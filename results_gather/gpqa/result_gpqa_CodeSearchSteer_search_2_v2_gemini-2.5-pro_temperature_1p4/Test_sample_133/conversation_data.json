    "To calculate the total enthalpy of neutralization, we must consider all the chemical reactions occurring when the solutions are mixed. The reactants are hydrochloric acid (HCl), sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄), and barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)₂).\n\nThe reactions involved are:\n1.  Neutralization of strong acids (HCl and H₂SO₄) by a strong base (Ba(OH)₂).\n2.  Precipitation of barium sulfate (BaSO₄), as it is an insoluble salt formed from Ba²⁺ (from Ba(OH)₂) and SO₄²⁻ (from H₂SO₄) ions.\n\nFirst, let's determine the number of moles of the reactive ions: H⁺, OH⁻, Ba²⁺, and SO₄²⁻.\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ ions:**\n    *   From 500 mL (0.5 L) of 0.2 M HCl: 0.5 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.10 mol H⁺\n    *   From 300 mL (0.3 L) of 0.3 M H₂SO₄: 0.3 L × 0.3 mol/L × 2 = 0.18 mol H⁺\n    *   **Total moles of H⁺ = 0.10 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol**\n\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ and Ba²⁺ ions:**\n    *   From 200 mL (0.2 L) of 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂: 0.2 L × 0.5 mol/L = 0.10 mol Ba(OH)₂\n    *   **Total moles of OH⁻ = 0.10 mol × 2 = 0.20 mol**\n    *   **Total moles of Ba²⁺ = 0.10 mol**\n\n*   **Moles of SO₄²⁻ ions:**\n    *   From 300 mL (0.3 L) of 0.3 M H₂SO₄: 0.3 L × 0.3 mol/L = **0.09 mol SO₄²⁻**\n\nNext, we calculate the heat released from each process. The standard enthalpy of neutralization for a strong acid and a strong base is approximately -13.7 kcal/mol.\n\n**1. Enthalpy of Neutralization:**\n\nThe neutralization reaction is: H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O. The reaction is limited by the ion with the fewer moles.\n*   Moles of H⁺ = 0.28 mol\n*   Moles of OH⁻ = 0.20 mol\nThe limiting reactant is OH⁻. Therefore, 0.20 moles of water will be formed.\n*   Heat released from neutralization = 0.20 mol × (-13.7 kcal/mol) = **-2.74 kcal**\n\n**2. Enthalpy of Precipitation:**\n\nThe precipitation reaction is: Ba²⁺(aq) + SO₄²⁻(aq) → BaSO₄(s). This reaction is limited by the ion with fewer moles.\n*   Moles of Ba²⁺ = 0.10 mol\n*   Moles of SO₄²⁻ = 0.09 mol\nThe limiting reactant is SO₄²⁻. Therefore, 0.09 moles of BaSO₄ precipitate is formed.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the \"enthalpy of neutralization.\" In many contexts, this specifically refers to the heat evolved from the formation of water (H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O). The formation of a precipitate introduces an additional enthalpy change (enthalpy of precipitation) which complicates the direct measurement of only the neutralization enthalpy. Often in such problems, if not explicitly stated to include the enthalpy of precipitation, it is intended to calculate only the heat from the acid-base reaction.\n\nBased on this interpretation, the calculation relies solely on the neutralization of H⁺ and OH⁻ ions.\n\n*   Enthalpy of neutralization = Moles of water formed × Standard enthalpy of neutralization\n*   Enthalpy of neutralization = 0.20 mol × (-13.7 kcal/mol) = -2.74 kcal\n\nThis value is very close to option A. The minor difference can be attributed to using a slightly different standard value for the enthalpy of neutralization, such as -13.6 kcal/mol.\n\nIf we calculate with -13.6 kcal/mol:\n*   Enthalpy of neutralization = 0.20 mol × (-13.6 kcal/mol) = -2.72 kcal\n\nThis exactly matches option A. Therefore, the question is focused on the heat released by the formation of water only.\n\n<<<A>>>"
