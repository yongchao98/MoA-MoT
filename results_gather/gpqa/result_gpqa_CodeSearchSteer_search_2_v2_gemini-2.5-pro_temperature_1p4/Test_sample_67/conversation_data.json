    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the oscillation frequency:\n\n1.  **Initial State:** At t=0, the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the spin is in an eigenstate of the Sz operator, specifically the \"spin-up\" state, denoted as |+z⟩.\n\n2.  **New Hamiltonian:** The magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction with the same magnitude B. The Hamiltonian (H) of the system for t ≥ 0 is given by the interaction energy between the magnetic moment (μ) and the magnetic field (B):\n    H = -μ ⋅ B\n    Since μ = γS, where S is the spin operator, and B is in the +Y direction (B = Bŷ), the Hamiltonian becomes:\n    H = - (γS) ⋅ (Bŷ) = -γB S_y\n    Here, S_y is the y-component of the spin operator.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution:** The state of the system |ψ(t)⟩ evolves according to the Schrödinger equation. For a time-independent Hamiltonian, the state at time t is:\n    |ψ(t)⟩ = e^(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)⟩\n    Substituting the Hamiltonian and the initial state |ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩, we get:\n    |ψ(t)⟩ = e^(iγBtS_y/ħ) |+z⟩\n\n4.  **Expectation Value of S_z:** We need to find the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the spin, ⟨S_z(t)⟩, which is given by:\n    ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩\n    Substituting the expression for |ψ(t)⟩:\n    ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨+z| e^(-iγBtS_y/ħ) S_z e^(iγBtS_y/ħ) |+z⟩\n\n5.  **Heisenberg Picture (Alternative approach):** It is often simpler to consider the time evolution of the operator in the Heisenberg picture. The time evolution of the S_z operator is given by the Heisenberg equation of motion:\n    dS_z(t)/dt = (i/ħ)[H, S_z(t)]\n    dS_z(t)/dt = (i/ħ)[-γBS_y, S_z] = (-iγB/ħ)[S_y, S_z]\n    Using the angular momentum commutation relation [S_y, S_z] = iħS_x, we get:\n    dS_z(t)/dt = (-iγB/ħ)(iħS_x) = γBS_x\n\n    Similarly, we can find the time evolution of S_x:\n    dS_x(t)/dt = (i/ħ)[-γBS_y, S_x] = (-iγB/ħ)[S_y, S_x]\n    Using [S_x, S_y] = iħS_z, we get [S_y, S_x] = -iħS_z.\n    dS_x(t)/dt = (-iγB/ħ)(-iħS_z) = -γBS_z\n\n6.  **Solving the Differential Equations:** We now have a system of coupled differential equations:\n    *   d⟨S_z⟩/dt = γB⟨S_x⟩\n    *   d⟨S_x⟩/dt = -γB⟨S_z⟩\n\n    Differentiating the first equation with respect to time and substituting the second equation gives:\n    d²⟨S_z⟩/dt² = γB (d⟨S_x⟩/dt) = γB (-γB⟨S_z⟩) = -(γB)²⟨S_z⟩\n\n    This is the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator: d²x/dt² = -ω²x. By comparison, the angular frequency of oscillation ω is:\n    ω = γB\n\nThis phenomenon is known as Larmor precession, where the spin vector precesses around the new magnetic field axis (the Y-axis in this case) with the Larmor frequency ω = γB. The projection of the spin onto the Z-axis therefore oscillates with this frequency.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is γB.\n\n<<<C>>>"
