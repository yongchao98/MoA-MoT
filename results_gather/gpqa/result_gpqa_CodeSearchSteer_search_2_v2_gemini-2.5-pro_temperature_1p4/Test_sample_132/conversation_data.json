    "The search results confirm the methodology used. Specifically, sources,,, and describe the use of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for a phosphate buffer system composed of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻. They affirm that the pH of such a solution is governed by the pKa₂ of phosphoric acid and the ratio of the concentrations of the conjugate base (HPO₄²⁻) to the weak acid (H₂PO₄⁻).\n\nThe calculation for the concentration of orthophosphate (PO₄³⁻) relies on the third dissociation constant, Ka₃, as this is the equilibrium that produces the PO₄³⁻ ion. The calculation requires the concentration of H⁺ and HPO₄²⁻. My initial approach to first calculate [H⁺] using the buffer equation for the second dissociation (Ka₂) and then use that value in the equilibrium expression for the third dissociation (Ka₃) is a standard and correct procedure.\n\nThe steps taken were:\n1.  **Calculate Molar Concentrations:**\n    *   Moles of KH₂PO₄ = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n    *   [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M\n    *   Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n    *   [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M\n\n2.  **Calculate [H⁺] using the Ka₂ equilibrium:**\n    *   H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n    *   Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n    *   [H⁺] = Ka₂ * [H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    *   [H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 / 0.02809) ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n3.  **Calculate [PO₄³⁻] using the Ka₃ equilibrium:**\n    *   HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n    *   Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * [HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺]\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809) / (8.11 x 10⁻⁸) ≈ 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe calculation is robust and the result aligns perfectly with option D.\n\nFinal Answer: The concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) is determined by the third dissociation equilibrium of phosphoric acid.\n\nFirst, we calculate the molar concentrations of the two components in the 200.00 cm³ (0.200 L) solution:\n*   Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻ from KH₂PO₄:\n    *   Moles = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n    *   [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M\n\n*   Concentration of HPO₄²⁻ from Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O:\n    *   Moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n    *   [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M\n\nThe solution is a buffer system consisting of the weak acid H₂PO₄⁻ and its conjugate base HPO₄²⁻. The hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺] is primarily controlled by the second dissociation equilibrium of phosphoric acid, governed by Ka₂.\n*   H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n*   Ka₂ = 6.2x10⁻⁸ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n\nWe can solve for [H⁺]:\n*   [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n*   [H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n*   [H⁺] ≈ 8.109 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\nThe orthophosphate ion, PO₄³⁻, is formed from the dissociation of HPO₄²⁻, which is governed by the third dissociation constant, Ka₃.\n*   HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n*   Ka₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹² = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n\nNow we can rearrange this expression to solve for the concentration of orthophosphate, [PO₄³⁻], using the previously calculated [H⁺] and the initial concentration of [HPO₄²⁻].\n*   [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * [HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺]\n*   [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M) / (8.109 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n*   [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThis value is closest to 6.24x10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<D>>>"
