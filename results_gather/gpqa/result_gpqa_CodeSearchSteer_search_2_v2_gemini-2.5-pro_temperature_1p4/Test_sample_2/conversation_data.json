    "To find the expectation value of the operator `10σz + 5σx`, we can calculate the expectation values of `σz` and `σx` separately and then combine them.\n\nThe spin state of the particle is given by the linear superposition:\n`|ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩`\n\nIn vector notation, where `|↑⟩ = [1, 0]` and `|↓⟩ = [0, 1]`, the state is:\n`|ψ⟩ = [0.5, √3/2]`\n\nThe Pauli matrices are defined as:\n`σz = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`\n`σx = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\n\nThe expectation value of an operator `A` for a state `|ψ⟩` is calculated as `⟨A⟩ = ⟨ψ|A|ψ⟩`.\n\n**1. Calculate the expectation value of `σz`:**\n\nA straightforward way to calculate `⟨σz⟩` for eigenstates of `σz` is:\n`⟨σz⟩ = |c↑|² * (+1) + |c↓|² * (-1)`\nwhere `c↑` and `c↓` are the probability amplitudes for the spin-up and spin-down states, respectively.\n`⟨σz⟩ = (0.5)² - (√3/2)² = 0.25 - 3/4 = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5`\n\n**2. Calculate the expectation value of `σx`:**\n\nFirst, we find the result of applying the `σx` operator to the state `|ψ⟩`:\n`σx|ψ⟩ = [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * [0.5, √3/2] = [√3/2, 0.5]`\n\nNow, we calculate the expectation value `⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩`. The bra vector `⟨ψ|` is the conjugate transpose of `|ψ⟩`, which is `[0.5, √3/2]`.\n`⟨σx⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [√3/2, 0.5]`\n`⟨σx⟩ = (0.5 * √3/2) + (√3/2 * 0.5) = √3/4 + √3/4 = 2√3/4 = √3/2`\n\n**3. Calculate the expectation value of the full operator:**\n\nThe expectation value of the operator `10σz + 5σx` is given by the linearity of expectation values:\n`⟨10σz + 5σx⟩ = 10 * ⟨σz⟩ + 5 * ⟨σx⟩`\n`⟨10σz + 5σx⟩ = 10 * (-0.5) + 5 * (√3/2)`\n`⟨10σz + 5σx⟩ = -5 + 2.5 * √3`\n\nNow, we approximate the numerical value (using √3 ≈ 1.732):\n`⟨10σz + 5σx⟩ ≈ -5 + 2.5 * 1.732 = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67`\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the value is **-0.7**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
