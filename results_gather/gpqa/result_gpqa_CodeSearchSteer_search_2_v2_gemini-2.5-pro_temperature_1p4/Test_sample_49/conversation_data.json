    "To determine the number of loops in the Feynman diagram, we must analyze the structure of the provided formula. The key to discovering the loop order lies not in the coupling constants (`alpha` and `g`) or the numerical factors, but in the factor of `1/(4pi)^6`.\n\nIn quantum field theory, calculations for Feynman diagrams that contain loops require integration over the undetermined momentum circulating within each loop. When using dimensional regularization, a common technique to handle the divergences that arise from these integrals, a characteristic factor appears for each loop.\n\nSpecifically, for each loop in a diagram in four-dimensional spacetime, the integration and subsequent calculations typically yield a factor of `1/(16pi^2)`, which can be written as `1/(4pi)^2`. This relationship is a standard result of performing loop integrals in `d=4` dimensions. An L-loop diagram, therefore, will have a factor of `(1/(4pi)^2)^L`, or `1/(4pi)^(2L)`.\n\nThe note found on the desk contains the term `1/(4pi)^6`. By comparing this to the general formula for an L-loop diagram, we can set the exponents equal to each other:\n\n2L = 6\n\nSolving for L (the number of loops), we get:\n\nL = 3\n\nThe other terms in the expression (`alpha^3`, `g^2`, etc.) relate to the number and type of interaction vertices and the physical scales of the process but do not directly determine the number of loops in this straightforward manner. The power of `(4pi)` is the most direct indicator of the loop order.\n\nTherefore, the Feynman diagram contained 3 loops.\n\n<<<D>>>"
