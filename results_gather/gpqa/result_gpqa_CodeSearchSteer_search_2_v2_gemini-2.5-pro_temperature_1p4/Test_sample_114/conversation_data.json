    "The angle between the two photons can be determined by applying the principles of conservation of energy and momentum from special relativity.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Define Initial State (Before Collision)**\n    *   **Electron (e⁻):** Moves from left to right (+x direction) with a Lorentz factor `γ_e = 4`.\n    *   **Positron (e⁺):** Moves from right to left (-x direction) with a Lorentz factor `γ_p = 2`. The positron has the same rest mass (`m_e`) as the electron.\n\n2.  **Calculate Initial Energy**\n    The total energy of a particle is given by `E = γ * m * c²`, where `m` is the rest mass and `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   Energy of the electron: `E_e = 4 * m_e * c²`\n    *   Energy of the positron: `E_p = 2 * m_e * c²`\n    *   **Total Initial Energy:** `E_initial = E_e + E_p = 4*m_e*c² + 2*m_e*c² = 6 * m_e * c²`\n\n3.  **Calculate Initial Momentum**\n    The momentum of a particle can be related to its energy and rest mass by the equation `E² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)²`. Thus, `p*c = sqrt(E² - (m*c²)²)`.\n    *   Momentum of the electron: `p_e*c = sqrt((4*m_e*c²)² - (m_e*c²)²) = sqrt(16-1) * m_e*c² = sqrt(15) * m_e*c²`. The direction is positive.\n    *   Momentum of the positron: `p_p*c = sqrt((2*m_e*c²)² - (m_e*c²)²) = sqrt(4-1) * m_e*c² = sqrt(3) * m_e*c²`. The direction is negative.\n    *   **Total Initial Momentum (in the x-direction):** `P_initial_x * c = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e*c²`. The initial momentum in the y-direction is zero.\n\n4.  **Define Final State (After Annihilation)**\n    *   Two photons (γ) are produced with equal energy, `E_γ`.\n    *   Photon 1 moves upper-right, making an angle `θ` with the x-axis.\n    *   Photon 2 moves lower-right, making an angle `-θ` with the x-axis (due to momentum conservation in the y-direction).\n\n5.  **Apply Conservation of Energy**\n    The total initial energy must equal the total final energy.\n    *   `E_initial = E_final`\n    *   `6 * m_e * c² = E_γ + E_γ = 2 * E_γ`\n    *   Therefore, the energy of each photon is `E_γ = 3 * m_e * c²`.\n\n6.  **Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n    The total initial momentum must equal the total final momentum. We only need to consider the x-direction, as the y-components cancel out.\n    *   The momentum of a photon is `p = E / c`. For each photon, `p_γ = (3 * m_e * c²) / c = 3 * m_e * c`.\n    *   The x-component of each photon's momentum is `p_γ * cos(θ)`.\n    *   **Total Final Momentum (in the x-direction):** `P_final_x = p_γ*cos(θ) + p_γ*cos(θ) = 2 * p_γ * cos(θ) = 2 * (3 * m_e * c) * cos(θ) = 6 * m_e * c * cos(θ)`.\n\n7.  **Solve for the Angle**\n    Equate the initial and final momentum in the x-direction (after dividing by `c`).\n    *   `P_initial_x = P_final_x`\n    *   `(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e * c = 6 * m_e * c * cos(θ)`\n    *   Canceling `m_e * c` from both sides gives: `cos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6`.\n    *   Using the values `sqrt(15) ≈ 3.873` and `sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732`, we get:\n        `cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 ≈ 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568`\n    *   `θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°`\n\n8.  **Find the Angle Between Photons**\n    The question asks for the total angle between the two photons, which is `2 * θ`.\n    *   Angle = `2 * 69.1° = 138.2°`\n\nThis value is closest to 138.\n\n<<<A>>>"
