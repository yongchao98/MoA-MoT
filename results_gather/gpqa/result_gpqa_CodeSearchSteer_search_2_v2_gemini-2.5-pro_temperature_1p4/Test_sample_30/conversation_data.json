    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n**Step 1: Nitration of Toluene**\nToluene is treated with a mixture of nitric acid (HNO₃) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction. The methyl group (-CH₃) is an ortho-, para-director. The major product, due to less steric hindrance, is *p*-nitrotoluene (4-nitrotoluene).\n\n*   **Product 1:** *p*-Nitrotoluene\n\n**Step 2: Oxidation of Product 1**\n*p*-Nitrotoluene is treated with manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). These conditions typically oxidize an alkyl group attached to an aromatic ring. While strong oxidizing agents would form a carboxylic acid, MnO₂ can be used to oxidize toluenes to aldehydes. A known process describes the oxidation of *p*-nitrotoluene to the corresponding aldehyde.\n\n*   **Product 2:** *p*-Nitrobenzaldehyde\n\n**Step 3: Aldol Condensation**\n*p*-Nitrobenzaldehyde is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide. This is a base-catalyzed aldol condensation, specifically a Claisen-Schmidt condensation, between an aldehyde with no α-hydrogens (*p*-nitrobenzaldehyde) and a ketone (acetone). The enolate of acetone attacks the carbonyl carbon of *p*-nitrobenzaldehyde. The resulting aldol addition product readily dehydrates to form a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n\n*   **Product 3:** (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one\n\n**Determining the Molecular Symmetry Group of Product 3**\nThe structure of the final product, (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one, is:\n\nO₂N—(C₆H₄)—CH=CH—C(=O)—CH₃\n\nTo determine its point group, we look for the symmetry elements it possesses:\n*   **Planarity:** The benzene ring, the trans double bond, and the carbonyl group form a largely planar conjugated system. Let's assume the entire heavy-atom framework lies in a single plane for symmetry analysis.\n*   **Rotation Axes (Cₙ):** There are no rotation axes of order 2 or higher. A C₂ axis passing through the nitro and butenone groups is prevented by the asymmetry of the acetyl group (-C(=O)CH₃).\n*   **Inversion Center (i):** The molecule does not have a center of inversion.\n*   **Plane of Symmetry (σ):** If the molecule is considered planar, the plane containing all the heavy atoms and the hydrogens of the double bond and benzene ring is a plane of symmetry. The methyl group's hydrogens would be positioned symmetrically with respect to this plane.\n*   **Improper Rotation Axes (Sₙ):** There are no improper rotation axes.\n\nA molecule that possesses only the identity element (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ) belongs to the **Cₛ** point group.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of product 3 is Cₛ.\n\n<<<D>>>"
