    "To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs, we must consider two main criteria for each star: its visibility from both observatories (celestial coordinates) and its brightness (apparent magnitude).\n\n### **1. Observatory Visibility**\n\nA star can only be observed if it rises above the horizon at the observatory's location. This is determined by the star's declination (DEC) and the observatory's latitude.\n\n*   **Paranal Observatory (hosting ESPRESSO):** Located at a latitude of approximately -24.6 degrees. It can observe stars with declinations from -90° up to approximately +65.4° (-24.6° + 90°).\n*   **W. M. Keck Observatory (hosting HIRES):** Located at a latitude of about +19.8 degrees. It can observe stars with declinations from +90° down to approximately -70.2° (19.8° - 90°).\n\nFor a star to be visible from **both** observatories, its declination must lie in the overlapping range of **-70.2° to +65.4°**.\n\n### **2. Magnitude Limits**\n\nEach spectrograph has a limit to how faint a star it can detect, measured by apparent V magnitude (a lower magnitude number is brighter).\n\n*   **ESPRESSO:** Can observe stars brighter than an apparent V magnitude of 17.\n*   **HIRES:** Can observe stars brighter than an apparent V magnitude of 16.\n\nFor a star to be detectable by **both** instruments, it must have an apparent V magnitude **brighter than 16.0**.\n\n### **3. Star-by-Star Analysis**\n\nLet's evaluate each star against these combined requirements (Declination between -70.2° and +65.4°, and Apparent V Magnitude < 16.0).\n\n**Star 1:**\n*   **Declination:** -75°. This is outside the visible range for the Keck Observatory.\n*   *Conclusion: Not observable by both.*\n\n**Star 2:**\n*   **Declination:** +55°. This is within the visible range for both observatories.\n*   **Apparent V Magnitude:** 16.5 mag. This is fainter than the HIRES limit of 16.0.\n*   *Conclusion: Not observable by both.*\n\n**Star 3:**\n*   **Declination:** +48°. This is within the visible range for both observatories.\n*   **Apparent V Magnitude:** 15.5 mag. This is brighter than the 16.0 magnitude limit for both instruments. The additional information about color excess and distance appears to be extraneous, as the final apparent magnitude is given.\n*   *Conclusion: Observable by both.*\n\n**Star 4:**\n*   **Declination:** -48°. This is within the visible range for both observatories.\n*   **Apparent V Magnitude:** This must be calculated from the absolute magnitude (M), distance (d), and extinction (A_V).\n    *   The relationship is: m = M + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + A_V.\n    *   M = 15.5 mag\n    *   d = 10 pc\n    *   A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag.\n    *   m = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10) - 5 + 1.24 = 15.5 + 5 - 5 + 1.24 = 16.74 mag.\n*   The resulting apparent magnitude of 16.74 is fainter than the HIRES limit of 16.0.\n*   *Conclusion: Not observable by both.*\n\n**Star 5:**\n*   **Declination:** +60°. This is within the visible range for both observatories.\n*   **Apparent V Magnitude:** Calculated from the absolute magnitude (M=16.5) and distance (d=5 pc).\n    *   m = M + 5 * log10(d) - 5\n    *   m = 16.5 + 5 * log10(5) - 5 = 16.5 + 5 * (0.699) - 5 = 16.5 + 3.495 - 5 ≈ 15.0 mag.\n*   The apparent magnitude of ~15.0 is brighter than the 16.0 magnitude limit for both instruments.\n*   *Conclusion: Observable by both.*\n\nBased on this analysis, Star 3 and Star 5 are the only ones that meet both the visibility and brightness criteria for both observatories.\n\n<<<C>>>"
