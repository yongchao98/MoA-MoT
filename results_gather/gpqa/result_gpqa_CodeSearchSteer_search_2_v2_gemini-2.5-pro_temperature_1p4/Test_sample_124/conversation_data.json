    "The physical system described is a three-dimensional isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator. Its energy eigenvalues are quantized and can be determined using a general formula.\n\n### Energy of the Third Excited State\n\nThe energy levels of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are given by the formula:\n$E_n = (n + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega$\nwhere `n` is the principal quantum number (n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...) and `ħ` is the reduced Planck's constant.\n\n*   The ground state corresponds to `n = 0`.\n*   The first excited state corresponds to `n = 1`.\n*   The second excited state corresponds to `n = 2`.\n*   The third excited state corresponds to `n = 3`.\n\nTo find the energy of the third excited state, we substitute `n = 3` into the energy formula:\n$E_3 = (3 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (9/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n### Degeneracy of the Third Excited State\n\nDegeneracy refers to the case where multiple distinct quantum states have the same energy. For the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the degeneracy of an energy level `E_n` can be calculated with the formula:\n$g_n = (n + 1)(n + 2) / 2$.\n\nTo find the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for the third excited state, we substitute `n = 3` into the degeneracy formula:\n$g_3 = (3 + 1)(3 + 2) / 2 = (4)(5) / 2 = 20 / 2 = 10$.\n\nTherefore, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions possible for this energy level.\n\nComparing these results with the given options, the correct choice is the one that has an energy of $(9/2)\\hbar\\omega$ and a degeneracy of 10.\n\n<<<B>>>"
