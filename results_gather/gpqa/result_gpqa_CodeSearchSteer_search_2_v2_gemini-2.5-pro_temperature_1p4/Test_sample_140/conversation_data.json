    "The reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia is a classic example of an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate. The number of possible products can be determined by considering all potential pathways.\n\nThe reaction involves two main stages:\n\n**1. Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nSodium amide is a very strong base and initiates the reaction by abstracting a proton (or deuteron) from a position ortho (adjacent) to the bromine atom.\n\n*   **Path A: Abstraction of a proton (H):** The starting material has a hydrogen atom at the C-6 position, which is ortho to the bromine. The abstraction of this proton is kinetically favored because the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond. This elimination leads to the formation of a **2-deuterobenzyne** intermediate, where the triple bond is between C-1 and C-6, and the deuterium remains at the C-2 position.\n*   **Path B: Abstraction of a deuteron (D):** The base can also abstract the deuterium from the C-2 position. Although this process is slower due to the kinetic isotope effect (the C-D bond is stronger than the C-H bond), it is still a possible pathway. This elimination results in the formation of a regular **benzyne** intermediate (with no deuterium) where the triple bond is between C-1 and C-2.\n\n**2. Nucleophilic Addition to Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide anion (NH₂⁻) from the solvent then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the reactive triple bond of the benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **Products from 2-deuterobenzyne (from Path A):**\n    *   If the amide ion attacks C-1, the subsequent protonation (from the ammonia solvent) yields **3-deuterioaniline** (or *meta*-deuterioaniline).\n    *   If the amide ion attacks C-6, the subsequent protonation yields **2-deuterioaniline** (or *ortho*-deuterioaniline).\n\n*   **Product from benzyne (from Path B):**\n    *   The amide ion can attack either C-1 or C-2 of the symmetrical benzyne intermediate. In either case, subsequent protonation results in the formation of a single product: **aniline** (with no deuterium).\n\nSince both benzyne intermediates can form, a total of three distinct organic products are possible:\n1.  2-deuterioaniline\n2.  3-deuterioaniline\n3.  Aniline\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<A>>>"
