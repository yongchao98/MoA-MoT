    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the relative speed and total energy of the system.\n\n### 1. Relative Speed (v_rel)\n\nTo find the relative speed between the two astronauts, we use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula. Let `v1 = 0.6c` be the velocity of the first astronaut and `v2 = 0.5c` be the velocity of the second astronaut. Since they are moving in the same direction, the formula is:\n\n`v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)`\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n`v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2)`\n`v_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3)`\n`v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7`\n`v_rel ≈ 0.142857c`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14c**.\n\n### 2. Total Energy (E)\n\nThe total energy of a relativistic particle is given by the formula E = γmc², where `γ` is the Lorentz factor, `m` is the rest mass, and `c` is the speed of light. The Lorentz factor is calculated as `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`. The total energy of the system is the sum of the individual energies of the two astronauts (`E_total = E1 + E2`).\n\n**Astronaut 1:**\n*   Mass (`m1`) = 2m\n*   Velocity (`v1`) = 0.6c\n*   Lorentz factor (`γ1`):\n    `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25`\n*   Energy (`E1`):\n    `E1 = γ1 * m1 * c² = 1.25 * (2m) * c² = 2.5 mc²`\n\n**Astronaut 2:**\n*   Mass (`m2`) = 3m\n*   Velocity (`v2`) = 0.5c\n*   Lorentz factor (`γ2`):\n    `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547`\n*   Energy (`E2`):\n    `E2 = γ2 * m2 * c² ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c² ≈ 3.4641 mc²`\n\n**Total System Energy:**\n*   `E_total = E1 + E2 = 2.5 mc² + 3.4641 mc² = 5.9641 mc²`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96 mc²**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated values are a relative speed of approximately `0.14c` and a total energy of approximately `5.96 mc²`. These results match option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
