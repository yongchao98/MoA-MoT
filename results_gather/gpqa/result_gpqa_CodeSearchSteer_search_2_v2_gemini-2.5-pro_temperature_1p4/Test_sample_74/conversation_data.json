  "question": "You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected.

    "The failure to express the GADD45G protein is due to the ribosome terminating translation prematurely. An analysis of the provided DNA sequence reveals the presence of a stop codon shortly after the sequence for the antigenic tag.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the sequence:\n*   **Start Codon**: The sequence begins with `ATG`, which is the standard start codon that initiates protein translation.\n*   **HA Tag**: The subsequent stretch of nucleotides, `TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC`, correctly codes for the amino acid sequence YPYDVPDYA. This is the intended influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag. The use of `GCC` instead of the more common `GCT` for Alanine (A) is a silent substitution and does not change the resulting amino acid.\n*   **Premature Stop Codon**: Following the HA tag sequence is the codon `AAA` (coding for Lysine), which is immediately followed by `TGA`. In the standard genetic code, TGA is a termination or \"stop\" codon (equivalent to UGA in mRNA).\n*   **Consequence**: When the ribosome translates the messenger RNA produced from this construct, it will build a very short polypeptide chain (Methionine, followed by the HA tag and a single Lysine) and then halt translation upon encountering the TGA stop codon. This premature termination prevents the synthesis of the full-length GADD45G protein, explaining the experimental failure.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n*   **A) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain**: While a linker can be beneficial, its absence is not the definitive error here. The primary issue is that the full protein is never synthesized in the first place.\n*   **B) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse**: This statement is flawed. The experiment is in Chinese hamster ovary cells, not mouse cells. More importantly, tRNAs are not supposed to exist for any of the three stop codons (UAA, UAG, or TGA); instead, release factors recognize them to terminate translation.\n*   **D) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation**: As analyzed above, the DNA sequence correctly codes for the intended YPYDVPDYA amino acid sequence of the HA tag. The one different codon is a silent, not a missense, mutation.\n\nTherefore, the introduction of a premature stop codon is the clear reason for the failed protein expression.\n\n<<<C>>>"
