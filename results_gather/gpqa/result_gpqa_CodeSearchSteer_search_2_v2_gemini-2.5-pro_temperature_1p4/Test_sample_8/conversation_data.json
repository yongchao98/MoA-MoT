    "To determine which molecule has C3h symmetry, we must analyze the symmetry elements of each compound. The C3h point group requires a three-fold rotational axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to that axis.\n\n*   **A) Quinuclidine:** This molecule, with the chemical name 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, has a cage-like structure. There is a C3 rotational axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposing bridgehead carbon. However, it does not have a horizontal mirror plane perpendicular to this axis. Instead, it possesses three vertical mirror planes that contain the C3 axis. Therefore, quinuclidine belongs to the C3v point group.\n\n*   **B) Triisopropyl borate:** The structure is B(OCH(CH₃)₂). It has a central boron atom bonded to three isopropoxy groups. Due to the free rotation around the B-O and O-C bonds, the molecule is flexible. While a conformation with C3h symmetry might be envisioned, it is not the fixed, ground-state symmetry. The molecule does not rigidly possess C3h symmetry.\n\n*   **C) Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone:** This molecule is also known as mellitic trianhydride or benzenehexacarboxylic 1,2:3,4:5,6-trianhydride. It consists of a central benzene ring fused to three furanone (anhydride) rings. While intermolecular interactions in a crystal can cause a slight propeller-like distortion (giving it D3 symmetry), the isolated molecule is planar. A planar molecule with a C3 axis automatically has a horizontal mirror plane (σh), which is the plane of the molecule itself. This molecule possesses a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane and lacks the perpendicular C2 axes that would elevate it to a D point group. The combination of a C3 axis and a σh plane places it in the C3h point group.\n\n*   **D) Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone:** This molecule has a larger triphenylene core instead of a benzene ring. Triphenylene itself has D3h symmetry. Fusing the three furanone rings maintains this high level of symmetry. It has a principal C3 axis, and critically, it also has three C2 axes lying in the molecular plane, perpendicular to the C3 axis. It also possesses a horizontal mirror plane (the molecular plane). The presence of the C3 axis and the three perpendicular C2 axes places this molecule in the D3h point group, not C3h.\n\nBased on this analysis, benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone is the molecule with C3h symmetry.\n\n<<<C>>>"
