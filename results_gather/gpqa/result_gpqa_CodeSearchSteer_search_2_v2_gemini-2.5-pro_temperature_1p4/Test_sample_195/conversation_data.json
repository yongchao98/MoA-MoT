    "My initial derivation of the maximum speed of a 1-D relativistic harmonic oscillator is confirmed by the principles of relativistic energy conservation.\n\nThe total energy of the system remains constant. This total energy is composed of the rest energy ($mc^2$), the relativistic kinetic energy ($K = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$), and the potential energy ($U = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$).\n\n1.  **At maximum amplitude (x = A):** The mass is momentarily at rest, so its velocity is $v = 0$.\n    *   The kinetic energy is zero.\n    *   The potential energy is at its maximum: $U_{max} = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n    *   The total energy of the system is the sum of its rest energy and the maximum potential energy:\n        $E_{total} = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n\n2.  **At the equilibrium position (x = 0):** The mass has its maximum velocity, $v = v_{max}$.\n    *   The potential energy is zero.\n    *   The total energy is the sum of the rest energy and the maximum kinetic energy. Relativistically, the total energy is given by $E = \\gamma mc^2$.\n    *   Therefore, at maximum speed, the total energy is:\n        $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$, where $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n\n3.  **Applying the principle of conservation of energy:** We equate the total energy at the two positions.\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n4.  **Solving for $v_{max}$:**\n    *   First, solve for $\\gamma_{max}$:\n        $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2}{mc^2} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n    *   Now, substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n        $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n    *   Invert both sides:\n        $\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n    *   Square both sides:\n        $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n    *   Rearrange to solve for $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n        $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n    *   Finally, solve for $v_{max}$:\n        $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\nThis derived expression matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
