    "Quantum field theories (QFTs) like Quantum Electrodynamics and Quantum Chromodynamics require a procedure called regularization to handle infinities, known as ultraviolet (UV) divergences, that arise in calculations. This process involves introducing a parameter, called a regulator, to make these calculations finite. By contrast, Classical Electrodynamics does not use this procedure, and Superstring Theory is believed to be inherently free of these types of divergences.\n\n**A) Superstring Theory:** This theory is a leading candidate for a quantum theory of gravity and is widely believed to be free of ultraviolet divergences. This is because it replaces point-like particles with one-dimensional strings, smoothing out the interactions at very short distances that cause infinities in standard quantum field theories. While there have been discussions and various proof techniques regarding finiteness and regularization in string theory, the consensus is that superstring theories do not have the UV divergences of QFTs and are thus considered UV-finite.\n\n**B) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** As the quantum field theory of the strong nuclear force, QCD describes the interactions of quarks and gluons. Like other QFTs, calculations in QCD involving loop diagrams lead to ultraviolet divergences. To obtain meaningful, finite physical predictions, these infinities must be dealt with through regularization and a subsequent process called renormalization. Common methods include lattice regularization and dimensional regularization.\n\n**C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** QED is the quantum theory of electromagnetism and was the first QFT where the problem of ultraviolet divergences was successfully managed. Calculations of physical quantities, such as the self-energy of the electron or corrections to scattering processes, result in divergent integrals. These infinities are tamed using regularization and renormalization, a process that has led to predictions of extraordinary accuracy.\n\n**D) Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory, governed by Maxwell's equations, is not a quantum field theory. As such, it does not involve the quantum loop calculations that produce the characteristic ultraviolet divergences of QFT. While classical electrodynamics does contain its own problem with infinities, specifically the infinite self-energy of a point-like charge, this issue is conceptually different from the UV divergences in quantum loops. This problem is sometimes called a \"classical analogue\" of UV divergence, but it is not treated by the regularization and renormalization techniques developed for QFT. Therefore, within the context of high-energy physics, classical electrodynamics never requires the procedure of regularization used in quantum field theory.\n\nBased on this, Classical Electrodynamics is the theory that does not require regularization in the sense the term is used in high-energy quantum physics.\n\n<<<D>>>"
