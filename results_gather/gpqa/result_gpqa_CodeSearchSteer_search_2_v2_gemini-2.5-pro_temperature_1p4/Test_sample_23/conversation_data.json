    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n    *   The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   Let the formula for the hydrocarbon be CₙHₘ.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula: `Mass % H = (m * Ar(H)) / (n * Ar(C) + m * Ar(H))`, where Ar is the atomic weight (Ar(H) ≈ 1, Ar(C) ≈ 12).\n    *   `0.1428 = m / (12n + m)`\n    *   `0.1428 * (12n + m) = m`\n    *   `1.7136n + 0.1428m = m`\n    *   `1.7136n = 0.8572m`\n    *   `m / n = 1.7136 / 0.8572 ≈ 2`\n    *   This gives an empirical formula of CH₂. The general formula for a hydrocarbon with this ratio is CₙH₂ₙ. This corresponds to either an alkene with one double bond or a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, which means it is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure of Z**\n    *   Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y gives *only one* substance, Z. This strongly implies that all compounds in both mixtures share the same carbon skeleton, which is that of Z.\n    *   Z is also described as being \"widely used as a solvent\". Among cycloalkanes, cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) is a very common industrial solvent.\n    *   Let's check if C₆H₁₂ fits the mass fraction: `Mass % H = (12 * 1) / (6 * 12 + 12 * 1) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857`. This is a perfect match.\n    *   Therefore, Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n\n3.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids formed from the disproportionation of X.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   One component of Y is Z, which is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). Let's call this Y₁.\n    *   Hydrogenation of the other component, Y₂, must also yield cyclohexane. For this to be possible, Y₂ must have the same C₆ skeleton. Since Y₂ does not decolorize bromine water, it cannot be an alkene or alkyne. An aromatic compound like benzene (C₆H₆) does not react with bromine water and can be hydrogenated under severe conditions (as stated in the problem) to form cyclohexane: `C₆H₆ + 3H₂ --(Pt, heat, pressure)--> C₆H₁₂`.\n    *   Thus, mixture Y consists of cyclohexane (Y₁ = C₆H₁₂) and benzene (Y₂ = C₆H₆).\n\n4.  **Analyze the Disproportionation Reaction**\n    *   Mixture X (composed of two liquids, X₁ and X₂) reacts to form mixture Y (cyclohexane and benzene). A disproportionation reaction, in this context, is a hydrogen transfer reaction where no atoms are lost from the system.\n    *   The reaction is: `X₁ + X₂ --(Pt, heat)--> Y₁ + Y₂`.\n    *   Since mixture X and mixture Y are both equimolar, the stoichiometry is 1:1 for reactants and products: `1 X₁ + 1 X₂ → 1 Y₁ + 1 Y₂`.\n    *   According to the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the equation.\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in the products is the sum of hydrogens in one molecule of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and one molecule of benzene (C₆H₆).\n    *   Total H atoms in products = 12 + 6 = 18.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Hydrogen Atoms in Mixture X**\n    *   Since the total number of hydrogen atoms is conserved, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (one molecule of X₁ and one molecule of X₂) must also be 18.\n    *   Let's verify that plausible compounds for X exist. Mixture X must decolorize bromine water (so X₁ and X₂ are unsaturated) and have no conjugated bonds. They both must have a C₆ skeleton.\n        *   A possible candidate for X₁ is cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀).\n        *   A possible candidate for X₂ is 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈), which is not conjugated.\n        *   The sum of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18.\n        *   The reaction `C₆H₁₀ (cyclohexene) + C₆H₈ (1,4-cyclohexadiene) → C₆H₁₂ (cyclohexane) + C₆H₆ (benzene)` is a balanced hydrogen transfer. This confirms our model is chemically consistent.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n\nTotal H atoms = H(X₁) + H(X₂) = 18.\n\n<<<B>>>"
