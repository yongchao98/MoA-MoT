    "Here is a breakdown of the two reactions to determine the major products, A and B.\n\n### **Reaction 1: Synthesis of Product A**\n\n*   **Reactants:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate, with potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) as the base.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition reaction. The strong, sterically hindered base, t-BuOK, deprotonates the ketone to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate then attacks the α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate).\n*   **Enolate Formation:** The ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, has two α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group), C2 and C6.\n    *   The C2 position is substituted with an ethyl and a methyl group, so it has no α-protons to be removed.\n    *   The C6 position is substituted with a methyl group and has one α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, the t-BuOK base can only remove the proton from the C6 position, leading to a single, specific enolate.\n*   **Michael Addition:** The C6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n*   **Product Structure and Naming:** The resulting product, A, is named by treating the propanoate chain as the parent. The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent on the third carbon of the ethyl propanoate chain. Following IUPAC naming rules:\n    *   The parent chain is **ethyl propanoate**.\n    *   The substituent is attached at C3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the cyclohexyl substituent, numbering starts at the point of attachment (the original C6 of the ketone). This carbon (C1' of the substituent) has a methyl group. The original carbonyl group is now at C2' (2-oxo), and the original C2, with its ethyl and methyl groups, is at C3' (3-ethyl-3-methyl).\n    *   Combining these gives the substituent name: **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name for product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction 2: Synthesis of Product B**\n\n*   **Reactants:** 1-nitropropane and (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as trans-crotononitrile), with potassium hydroxide (KOH) and water.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael addition. The base (KOH) deprotonates the acidic α-carbon of 1-nitropropane to form a nitronate anion. This nucleophile then attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n*   **Nucleophile Formation:** KOH removes a proton from the carbon adjacent to the nitro group in 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂C**H₂**-NO₂), forming the nucleophilic anion [CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻.\n*   **Michael Addition:** This anion attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-**CH**=CH-CN). A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitroalkane and the β-carbon of the nitrile.\n*   **Product Structure and Naming:** The resulting product, B, is a nitrile.\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile functional group is six carbons long, making it a **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Numbering the chain starts from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n    *   CH₃(6)-CH₂(5)-**CH(NO₂)**(4)-**CH(CH₃)**(3)-CH₂(2)-CN(1)\n    *   The substituents are a **methyl group at C3** and a **nitro group at C4**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nThis combination matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
