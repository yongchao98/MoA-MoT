    "To detect the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) absorption line from Earth, its wavelength must be shifted from the far-ultraviolet into the atmospheric optical window. The Lyα transition has a rest wavelength of approximately 1216 Angstroms (Å) or 121.6 nanometers. This wavelength falls into the ultraviolet (UV) part of the spectrum, which is strongly absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere.\n\nGround-based optical telescopes are limited by the atmospheric cutoff, below which incoming light is absorbed, primarily by ozone. This cutoff is not perfectly sharp, but the atmosphere becomes almost entirely opaque to wavelengths shorter than about 3000 Å (300 nm). For practical astronomical observations, significant transparency is typically achieved for wavelengths longer than about 3200-3500 Å. One source specifically states that direct ground-based observations of the Lyα transition are restricted to redshifts of approximately z ≳ 1.7.\n\nThe redshift (z) relates the rest wavelength (λ_rest) and the observed wavelength (λ_obs) by the formula:\n\n1 + z = λ_obs / λ_rest\n\nTo find the minimum redshift, we must determine the shortest possible observed wavelength, which corresponds to the atmospheric cutoff. Let's calculate the redshift for the options provided:\n\n*   **For a redshift of 1.2:**\n    λ_obs = 1216 Å * (1 + 1.2) = 2675.2 Å. This wavelength is still in the UV and would be blocked by the atmosphere.\n*   **For a redshift of 1.9:**\n    λ_obs = 1216 Å * (1 + 1.9) = 3526.4 Å. This wavelength is in the violet/near-UV part of the spectrum and can pass through the atmosphere to be detected by ground-based telescopes.\n*   **For a redshift of 2.4:**\n    λ_obs = 1216 Å * (1 + 2.4) = 4134.4 Å. This is well within the visible range (blue light).\n*   **For a redshift of 3:**\n    λ_obs = 1216 Å * (1 + 3) = 4864 Å. This is also well within the visible part of the spectrum.\n\nBased on these calculations, a redshift of 1.2 is too low for the Lyα line to penetrate the atmosphere. A redshift of 1.9 shifts the line to just above the atmospheric UV cutoff, making it observable. Therefore, the lower limit on the redshift for these objects to be detected by optical ground-based telescopes is approximately 1.9.\n\n<<<C>>>"
