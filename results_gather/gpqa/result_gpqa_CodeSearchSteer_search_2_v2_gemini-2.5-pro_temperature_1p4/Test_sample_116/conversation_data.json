    "To determine which of the given compounds show optical isomerism, each structure must be analyzed for chirality. Optical isomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. This property is known as chirality.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This is a substituted biphenyl compound. Biphenyls can exhibit a type of chirality called atropisomerism when there is restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restriction is caused by bulky substituents at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). In this molecule, all four ortho positions are substituted with large groups (nitro and dimethyl carboxylate). This steric hindrance prevents the rings from becoming coplanar and locks the molecule into a specific, non-planar conformation. Because the substitution pattern makes the molecule asymmetric (it lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion), it is non-superimposable on its mirror image and therefore chiral. Thus, it will show optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: This compound, also known as methyl lactate, has the chemical formula CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. To determine if it is chiral, we examine the carbon atom at position 2. This carbon is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). A carbon atom bonded to four distinct groups is a chiral center. Molecules with a single chiral center are always chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism, existing as a pair of enantiomers (D and L forms).\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The chemical formula for benzophenone is (C₆H₅)₂CO. The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two identical phenyl groups. This molecule does not contain any chiral centers. While the individual molecule is not chiral, benzophenone can crystallize in a chiral form, meaning the arrangement of molecules in the crystal lattice is chiral. However, the question refers to the optical isomerism of the organic moiety (the molecule itself), which is achiral and thus does not exhibit optical isomerism in solution or as an individual molecule.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This molecule is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, with the formula CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. It is a trans-isomer of a substituted alkene. The molecule is planar and has a center of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism. While it is a stereoisomer (a geometric isomer of dimethyl maleate), it is not an optical isomer.\n\nBased on this analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate (1) and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (2) are the compounds that show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<A>>>"
