    "To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we can use the principles of planetary equilibrium temperature and Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion.\n\n### 1. Equilibrium Temperature\n\nA planet's equilibrium temperature (T_eq) is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates away. It is inversely proportional to the square root of the planet's distance (d) from the star. This can be expressed as:\n\nT_eq ∝ 1 / √d\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2 is:\n\nT_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = √[d(Planet_2) / d(Planet_4)]\n\n### 2. Kepler's Third Law\n\nKepler's Third Law states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is directly proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (which is the distance 'd' for a circular orbit). This relationship is given by:\n\nP² ∝ d³\n\nThis implies that the distance 'd' is proportional to the orbital period 'P' raised to the power of 2/3:\n\nd ∝ P^(2/3)\n\nFrom this, we can establish the ratio of the distances of the two planets in terms of their orbital periods:\n\nd(Planet_2) / d(Planet_4) = [P(Planet_2) / P(Planet_4)]^(2/3)\n\n### 3. Combining the Formulas and Calculation\n\nBy substituting the distance ratio from Kepler's Law into the temperature ratio equation, we get:\n\nT_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = √[ (P(Planet_2) / P(Planet_4))^(2/3) ]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nT_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = (P(Planet_2) / P(Planet_4))^(1/3)\n\nThe problem states that the ratio of the orbital periods for Planet_1 through Planet_5 is 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Therefore, the ratio of the periods for Planet_2 to Planet_4 is:\n\nP(Planet_2) / P(Planet_4) = 2 / 3.5 = 4 / 7\n\nNow, we can calculate the temperature ratio:\n\nT_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = (4 / 7)^(1/3)\n\n(4 / 7) ≈ 0.5714\n\n(0.5714)^(1/3) ≈ 0.82998\n\nThis value is approximately 0.83.\n\n<<<D>>>"
