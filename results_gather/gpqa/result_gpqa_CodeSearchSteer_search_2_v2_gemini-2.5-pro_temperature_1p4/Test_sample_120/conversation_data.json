    "The reaction of an organocuprate, such as lithium dimethylcuprate (Me₂CuLi), with an epoxide is a cornerstone of organic synthesis for forming carbon-carbon bonds. The reaction proceeds via an Sₙ2 mechanism, which dictates both the regioselectivity and the stereochemistry of the product.\n\n**Analysis of the Reaction:**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The reactant is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a substituted cyclohexane ring fused to an epoxide. The two carbons of the epoxide ring are C1 and C6. C1 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to three other carbons and an oxygen), and it bears a methyl group. C6 is a secondary carbon (bonded to two other carbons and an oxygen).\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi, known as a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, in this case, a methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Regioselectivity:** The prompt correctly states that the alkyl group of the organocuprate attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. In this molecule, C6 is a secondary carbon, while C1 is a tertiary carbon with a methyl group. Therefore, C6 is the less hindered site, and it is where the nucleophilic attack by the methyl group will occur.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reaction proceeds through a backside attack, characteristic of an Sₙ2 reaction. This results in the inversion of the stereochemical configuration at the carbon being attacked. The configurations of the other stereocenters in the molecule, which are not directly involved in the ring-opening, are retained.\n\n**Determining the Product:**\n\n1.  **Site of Attack:** The incoming methyl nucleophile from Me₂CuLi attacks the less hindered C6 of the epoxide.\n2.  **Ring Opening:** The attack breaks the C6-O bond. The oxygen atom remains attached to C1 and, after an acidic workup (an implicit step to neutralize the intermediate), becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:**\n    *   The stereocenter at C6, which has an (S) configuration in the starting material, undergoes inversion to become (R) in the product.\n    *   The stereocenters at C1, C3, and C4 are not part of the reaction and retain their original configurations: (1R), (3R), and (4R).\n4.  **Product Structure and Nomenclature:**\n    *   The resulting product is a substituted cyclohexanol. The hydroxyl group is on C1 (from the reactant), which also has a methyl group. The newly added methyl group is on the adjacent carbon, C2 (originally C6). The other original methyl groups are now at positions C4 and C5 based on standard IUPAC numbering for the cyclohexanol product.\n    *   The final structure is a 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n    *   Let's map the stereochemistry to the new name:\n        *   **C1:** Retains its (R) configuration.\n        *   **C2 (from C6):** Inverts from (S) to (R).\n        *   **C4 (from C4):** Retains its (R) configuration.\n        *   **C5 (from C3):** Retains its (R) configuration.\n\nTherefore, the full IUPAC name of the product is (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n<<<B>>>"
