    "The expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) of a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials account for the fact that electromagnetic fields propagate at the finite speed of light, `c`. Therefore, the potentials at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t` depend on the state of the charge at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time `tr`.\n\nThe correct expressions are derived from Maxwell's equations. Let's analyze the provided options based on the standard formulas for Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\nThe scalar potential `V` is given by:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} / c)}$\nwhere all quantities on the right, such as the separation vector $\\vec{d}$ and velocity $\\vec{v}$, are evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n\nBy multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`, this expression can be rewritten as:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThe vector potential $\\vec{A}$ is related to the scalar potential `V` by the expression:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$\n\nSubstituting the expression for `V` and the relation $\\mu_o = 1/(\\epsilon_o c^2)$, we get:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} \\left( \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\right) = \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o c (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o q c \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nComparing these derived formulas with the given options:\n*   **A) and B)** are incorrect because they represent the static or non-relativistic potential and do not account for the retardation effects in the denominator.\n*   **C)** correctly presents both the scalar potential `V` and the vector potential `A` derived from the Liénard-Wiechert formulas.\n*   **D)** is incorrect due to the positive sign in the denominator. The Doppler-like factor $(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$ correctly features a minus sign.\n\nTherefore, the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
