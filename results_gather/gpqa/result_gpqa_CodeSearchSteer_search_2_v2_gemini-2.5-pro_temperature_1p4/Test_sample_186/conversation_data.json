    "To determine how many of the listed stars are detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph, we must evaluate two main criteria for each star:\n1.  **Visibility:** Can the star be observed from the Paranal Observatory in Chile?\n2.  **Brightness:** Is the star's apparent magnitude bright enough to achieve the required signal-to-noise ratio?\n\nThe Paranal Observatory is located at a latitude of approximately 24.6° South. This means that stars with very high northern declinations are not visible. A star is considered detectable if a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 10 can be reached in a one-hour exposure. For ESPRESSO, operating with one of the 8m VLT telescopes in a binned mode suitable for faint objects (HR42 mode), this corresponds to a limiting apparent visual magnitude (V) of approximately 18.\n\nHere is the analysis for each star:\n\n**a) Canopus**\n*   **Visibility:** Canopus has a declination of about -52° 41'. As a southern hemisphere star, it is easily visible from Paranal.\n*   **Brightness:** Its apparent visual magnitude is a very bright -0.74. This is significantly brighter than the V=18 limit.\n*   **Conclusion:** Canopus is **detectable**.\n\n**b) Polaris**\n*   **Visibility:** Polaris is the North Star, with a declination of almost +89° 15'. It is located at the north celestial pole and is not visible from a southern latitude like Paranal's (-24.6°).\n*   **Conclusion:** Polaris is **not detectable**.\n\n**c) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 10 pc distance**\n*   **Visibility:** A declination of 0° means the star is on the celestial equator and is visible from Paranal.\n*   **Brightness:** We calculate the apparent magnitude (m) using the absolute magnitude (M=15) and the distance (d=10 pc) with the distance modulus formula:\n    m = M + 5 * log₁₀(d/10)\n    m = 15 + 5 * log₁₀(10/10) = 15 + 5 * 0 = 15.0\n    An apparent magnitude of 15.0 is brighter than the V=18 limit.\n*   **Conclusion:** This star is **detectable**.\n\n**d) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 200 pc distance**\n*   **Visibility:** This star is on the celestial equator and is visible from Paranal.\n*   **Brightness:** Using the distance modulus formula with d=200 pc:\n    m = 15 + 5 * log₁₀(200/10) = 15 + 5 * log₁₀(20) ≈ 15 + 5 * (1.301) ≈ 21.5\n    An apparent magnitude of 21.5 is much fainter than the V=18 limit.\n*   **Conclusion:** This star is **not detectable**.\n\n**e) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 5 pc distance**\n*   **Visibility:** This star is on the celestial equator and is visible from Paranal.\n*   **Brightness:** Using the distance modulus formula with d=5 pc:\n    m = 15 + 5 * log₁₀(5/10) = 15 + 5 * log₁₀(0.5) ≈ 15 + 5 * (-0.301) ≈ 13.5\n    An apparent magnitude of 13.5 is brighter than the V=18 limit.\n*   **Conclusion:** This star is **detectable**.\n\n**f) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 50 pc distance**\n*   **Visibility:** This star is on the celestial equator and is visible from Paranal.\n*   **Brightness:** Using the distance modulus formula with d=50 pc:\n    m = 15 + 5 * log₁₀(50/10) = 15 + 5 * log₁₀(5) ≈ 15 + 5 * (0.699) ≈ 18.5\n    An apparent magnitude of 18.5 is fainter than the V=18 limit.\n*   **Conclusion:** This star is **not detectable**.\n\nIn summary, the detectable stars are Canopus, Star (c), and Star (e).\n\nTherefore, 3 of the listed stars would be detectable.\n\n<<<A>>>"
