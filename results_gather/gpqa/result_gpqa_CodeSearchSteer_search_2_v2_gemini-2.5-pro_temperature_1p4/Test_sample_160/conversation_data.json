    "This scenario requires comparing two types of mean free paths: the mean free path of gas molecules colliding with each other (λ1) and the mean free path of high-energy electrons scattering off those same gas molecules (λ2).\n\nHere is a breakdown of the physics involved:\n\n*   **Mean Free Path (λ):** In general, the mean free path is the average distance a particle travels before a collision or scattering event. It is inversely proportional to the number density of target particles (n) and the collision cross-section (σ): λ = 1/(nσ). The number density (n) of gas molecules is the same in both scenarios. Therefore, the difference between λ1 and λ2 is determined by the difference in their respective interaction cross-sections.\n\n*   **λ1 (Gas Molecule-Molecule Collisions):** This is the classical mean free path from the kinetic theory of gases. The interaction is between two relatively large molecules that collide when their electron clouds significantly overlap. The \"target size,\" or kinetic cross-section (σ1), is related to the physical diameter of the gas molecules.\n\n*   **λ2 (Electron-Molecule Scattering):** This involves a very small, high-energy (1000 kV) point-like particle (the electron) interacting with a gas molecule. A fast electron can pass through large regions of a molecule's electron cloud without significant deviation. A scattering event that counts toward the mean free path requires a close interaction with the strong electric fields of the atomic nuclei or individual electrons within the molecule.\n\n**Comparing the Cross-Sections:**\n\nThe key point is that the effective target area a molecule presents to a high-energy electron (σ2) is significantly *smaller* than the kinetic target area it presents to another, slower-moving molecule (σ1). The electron is a tiny projectile and interacts with small specific points within the atom, whereas a molecule-molecule collision is a larger-scale event.\n\nSince the scattering cross-section for the electrons (σ2) is much smaller than the collision cross-section for the gas molecules (σ1), the electron's mean free path (λ2) will be much longer than the gas molecule's mean free path (λ1).\n\nBecause λ is inversely proportional to σ:\n*   If σ2 < σ1\n*   Then λ2 > λ1\n\nThis eliminates options C and D. Now we must consider the magnitude. My physical reasoning indicates that λ2 is not just larger, but substantially larger than λ1. Therefore, a relationship like λ2 ≥ 1.22*λ1 is much more plausible than one that puts a small upper bound on λ2. The scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron can be orders of magnitude smaller than the gas-kinetic cross-section, which would make λ2 orders of magnitude larger than λ1. Therefore, the condition specified in option A is easily met.\n\n<<<A>>>"
