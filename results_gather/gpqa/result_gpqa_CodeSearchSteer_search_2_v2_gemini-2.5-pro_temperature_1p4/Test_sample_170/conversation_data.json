    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**1. Classification of Substituents**\n\nFirst, we classify the substituent on each benzene ring based on its directing effect in electrophilic aromatic substitution:\n\n*   **Ortho-, Para-Directing Groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (in this case, Br+) to the positions ortho and para to themselves. They are typically activating groups (like alkyl groups) or halogens.\n    *   1) `C6H5-CH3` (Toluene): -CH3 is an activating, ortho-, para-directing group.\n    *   3) `C6H5-Cl` (Chlorobenzene): -Cl is a deactivating, but ortho-, para-directing group.\n    *   5) `C6H5-C2H5` (Ethylbenzene): -C2H5 is an activating, ortho-, para-directing group.\n\n*   **Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They are deactivating groups. The formation of the para-isomer is very low for these substances.\n    *   2) `C6H5-COOC2H5` (Ethyl benzoate): -COOC2H5 is a deactivating, meta-directing group.\n    *   4) `C6H5-NO2` (Nitrobenzene): -NO2 is a strongly deactivating, meta-directing group.\n    *   6) `C6H5-COOH` (Benzoic acid): -COOH is a deactivating, meta-directing group.\n\n**2. Ranking the Meta-Directing Groups**\n\nSubstances with meta-directing groups will have the lowest yields of the para-isomer. The yield of para-isomers for these reactions is typically only a few percent.\n\n*   **4) C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** The nitro group (-NO2) is one of the strongest deactivating groups. Bromination of nitrobenzene yields the meta-isomer almost exclusively, with only trace amounts of the ortho and para products. Therefore, it will have the lowest para-isomer yield.\n*   **6) C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid) and 2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** The carboxylic acid (-COOH) and ester (-COOC2H5) groups are also strongly deactivating and meta-directing. They will produce very small amounts of the para-isomer, but generally slightly more than nitrobenzene. Comparing the two, they have similar deactivating strengths. For the purpose of ordering, we can place them after nitrobenzene. Without specific experimental data for bromination, we can infer from nitration data where ethyl benzoate gives about 5% para-product. It is reasonable to assume a similar very low yield for benzoic acid. The typical order of deactivating strength is -NO2 > -COOH ≈ -COOR. A stronger deactivator generally leads to a lower yield of the minor para product.\n\nThus, the order for the first three substances is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**3. Ranking the Ortho-, Para-Directing Groups**\n\nThese substances will have a significantly higher yield of the para-isomer compared to the meta-directors. The ratio of para to ortho product is primarily influenced by steric hindrance. A bulkier substituent will hinder attack at the ortho position, leading to a higher proportion of the para-isomer.\n\n*   **1) C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** The methyl group is relatively small. While it directs ortho-para, the ortho position is quite accessible. Typical bromination of toluene yields a significant amount of the ortho product, with the para-isomer yield being around 60-70% under standard conditions.\n*   **5) C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** The ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group. This increased size creates more steric hindrance at the ortho positions, making the para position more favorable for the incoming bromine. Therefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be greater for ethylbenzene than for toluene.\n*   **3) C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** Halogens are a special case. Although they are deactivating overall, they are ortho-, para-directing. Due to electronic factors and the size of the chlorine atom, the para position is strongly favored. For the bromination of chlorobenzene, the para-isomer is the major product, with yields often exceeding 90%. This is a higher para selectivity than for toluene and ethylbenzene.\n\nThus, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for these three is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**4. Final Ordering**\n\nCombining the two groups, we get the complete sequence for increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer:\n\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to the sequence:\nNitrobenzene < Benzoic Acid < Ethyl Benzoate < Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene\n\nComparing this sequence with the given options, it matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
