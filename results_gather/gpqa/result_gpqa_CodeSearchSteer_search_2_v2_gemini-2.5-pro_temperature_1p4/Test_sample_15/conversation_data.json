    "To determine which of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, each molecule must be assessed for chirality. A molecule is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The presence of stereocenters and the absence of symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion are key indicators of chirality.\n\n1.  ***(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene***: This compound is an alkene. The carbons of the double bond are not chiral centers. The molecule itself is planar and therefore has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral and optically inactive.\n\n2.  ***(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione***: The name explicitly defines a specific stereoisomer with configurations (3aR, 7aS) at its chiral centers. Since a single, specific enantiomer is named, it is by definition chiral and optically active.\n\n3.  ***(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid***: This molecule has two chiral centers at carbons 2 and 3. However, the (2R, 3S) configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry. Such a compound is called a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral despite having stereocenters and are therefore optically inactive.\n\n4.  ***(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid***: This compound also has two chiral centers. Unlike the (2R, 3S) version, the (2R, 3R) stereoisomer lacks a plane of symmetry and is part of an enantiomeric pair (the other being 2S, 3S). As a single enantiomer, it is chiral and optically active.\n\n5.  ***(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol***: The name indicates the (R) configuration at carbon 1, which is a chiral center. This specificity means it is a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, and thus it is optically active.\n\n6.  ***(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol***: This compound, also known as cis-1,3,5-Cyclohexanetriol, has hydroxyl groups on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. Due to this high degree of symmetry, the molecule possesses planes of symmetry, making it achiral and optically inactive.\n\n7.  ***1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one***: The structure of this ketone is cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2. An examination of the structure reveals no carbon atom is bonded to four different groups. The molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral and optically inactive.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds from the list:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<D>>>"
