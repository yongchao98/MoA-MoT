    "The correct statements about the molecular biology of SARS-CoV-2 are A, C, and D. The incorrect statement is B.\n\n*   **Statement A is correct.** The SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a protein can induce apoptosis by activating caspase-8, a key initiator of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. Studies have shown that this occurs without affecting the expression levels of Bcl-2, a crucial protein in the intrinsic (mitochondrial) apoptotic pathway. This suggests that ORF3a primarily triggers apoptosis through the extrinsic pathway. Some research also indicates a subsequent cross-talk with the intrinsic pathway via the cleavage of the protein Bid by caspase-8.\n\n*   **Statement B is incorrect.** While it is true that SARS-CoV-2 nsp10 and nsp14 form a heterodimer complex (nsp10/nsp14-ExoN) that functions as a 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease in a proofreading or mismatch repair mechanism, it does not prevent the breakdown of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). In fact, this complex is a potent dsRNA-degrading enzyme. The degradation of viral dsRNA intermediates is one of its roles, potentially helping the virus evade the host's innate immune system which recognizes dsRNA as a sign of viral infection.\n\n*   **Statement C is correct.** Programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting is a crucial translational mechanism for SARS-CoV-2. It allows the ribosome to shift backward by one nucleotide at a specific \"slippery sequence\" (U_UUA_AAC), guided by a downstream RNA structure called a pseudoknot. This event results in the synthesis of two large polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, from the same genomic RNA. Structural analyses, such as small-angle X-ray scattering, have confirmed that the pseudoknot structures of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share the same overall conformation.\n\n*   **Statement D is correct.** Research has established a linear correlation between the efficiency of frameshifting *in vitro* and the conformational plasticity of the RNA pseudoknot, which is the number of different folded states it can adopt. Optical tweezer experiments have shown that under tension, both the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 programmed frameshift signal elements adopt two distinct conformations. This is consistent with other viral pseudoknots that exhibit comparable rates of frameshifting.\n\n<<<B>>>"
