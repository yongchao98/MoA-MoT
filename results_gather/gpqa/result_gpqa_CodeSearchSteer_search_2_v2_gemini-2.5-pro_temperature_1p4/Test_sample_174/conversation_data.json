    "An oscillating spheroidal charge distribution can be modeled as a simple oscillating electric dipole, provided its size is much smaller than the wavelength of the radiation it emits. The radiated power per unit solid angle in the radiation zone from such a dipole is a function of both the angle of measurement and the wavelength of the radiation.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the physics involved:\n\n*   **Angular Dependence:** The time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (dP/dΩ) by an oscillating electric dipole with its axis along the z-axis is given by the formula:\n\n    (dP/dΩ) ∝ sin²(θ)\n\n    where θ is the angle with respect to the z-axis. The power is at its maximum when θ = 90° (perpendicular to the oscillation axis), because sin²(90°) = 1. This maximum power is denoted as A. At an angle of θ = 30°, the sine is sin(30°) = 1/2. Therefore, the power radiated at this angle is proportional to sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4. The fraction of the maximum power A is thus 1/4.\n\n*   **Wavelength Dependence:** The power radiated by an oscillating dipole is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency (ω⁴). Since the angular frequency is related to the wavelength (λ) by the equation ω = 2πc/λ (where c is the speed of light), the power has a dependence on the wavelength as follows:\n\n    Power ∝ ω⁴ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴\n\n    This λ⁻⁴ relationship is a characteristic feature of electric dipole radiation and is also responsible for physical phenomena like Rayleigh scattering, which explains why the sky is blue.\n\nCombining these two results, the fraction of the maximum power radiated at an angle of 30° is 1/4, and the power's dependence on wavelength follows a λ⁻⁴ form.\n\n<<<B>>>"
