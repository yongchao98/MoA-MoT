    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and chromatographic separations:\n\n### **Reaction I Analysis**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This molecule is a ketone and possesses a single chiral center at the C5 position with the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), followed by an acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at the C3 position to a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the Product:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. Since the starting material is optically pure (only the S isomer is present), the hydride from LAH can attack the planar carbonyl from two different faces. This results in the formation of two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two molecules are diastereomers, as one stereocenter is the same (5S) while the other is different (3R vs. 3S).\n\n### **Reaction II Analysis**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is a symmetric, achiral dione.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), followed by an acidic workup. NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the Products:** The reduction of the two ketone groups at C2 and C4 creates two new stereocenters. This can result in three possible stereoisomers:\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n    *   **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n*   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, making them a pair of **enantiomers**.\n*   The (2R, 4S) isomer has an internal plane of symmetry, making it an achiral **meso compound**. (Note: The (2S, 4R) isomer is identical to the (2R, 4S) isomer).\n*   Therefore, this reaction produces a total of three distinct stereoisomers: the meso compound and a racemic mixture of the two enantiomers.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Products by HPLC**\n\nAfter both reactions are complete, the products are combined. The mixture contains a total of five different compounds:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  meso-(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\nA normal-phase HPLC column is achiral and separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore **cannot be separated**. They will elute together as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers**, on the other hand, have different physical properties and **can be separated**.\n\nLet's count the peaks:\n*   The two products from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers and will produce **two separate peaks**.\n*   The enantiomeric pair from Reaction II, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will co-elute and produce **one peak**.\n*   The meso compound from Reaction II is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have different properties, thus producing a **separate peak**.\n\nTotal peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 2 (from Reaction I) + 1 (from enantiomeric pair) + 1 (from meso compound) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC**\n\nAn HPLC with a chiral stationary phase is designed to interact differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n*   **Enantiomers can be separated** by a chiral column.\n*   **Diastereomers**, being distinct compounds, will also be separated.\n\nLet's count the peaks:\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will produce **two separate peaks**.\n*   The two enantiomers from Reaction II, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will be resolved by the chiral column and produce **two separate peaks**.\n*   The meso compound from Reaction II, being a distinct achiral molecule, will produce its own **separate peak**.\n\nTotal peaks in chiral HPLC = 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II enantiomers) + 1 (from Reaction II meso compound) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe combined product mixture will show **5 peaks** in the chromatogram from the chiral HPLC and **4 peaks** in the chromatogram from the normal-phase HPLC.\n\n<<<D>>>"
