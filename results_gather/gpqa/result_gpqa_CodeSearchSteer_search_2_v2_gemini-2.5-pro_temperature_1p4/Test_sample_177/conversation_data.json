    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the mass dimension of κ and the renormalizability of the theory.\n\n### 1. Mass Dimensions in Quantum Field Theory\n\nIn natural units (where ħ = c = 1), the action, `S`, is dimensionless. The action is the integral of the Lagrangian density, `L`, over four-dimensional spacetime:\n`S = ∫ d⁴x L`\n\n*   The action `S` has a mass dimension of `[S] = 0`.\n*   The spacetime volume element `d⁴x` has a dimension of `(length)⁴`. Since length is the inverse of mass `([x] = [M]⁻¹)`, the mass dimension of `d⁴x` is `[d⁴x] = -4`.\n*   For the action `S` to be dimensionless, the Lagrangian density `L` must have a mass dimension of `[L] = 4`.\n\nTherefore, the interaction term in question, `L_int`, must also have a mass dimension of 4.\n`[L_int] = [κ ψ̄ σ_μν ψ F^μν] = 4`\n\n### 2. Mass Dimension of the Fields\n\nTo find the dimension of `κ`, we must first determine the mass dimensions of the fields `ψ` and `F^μν`.\n\n*   **Fermion Field (ψ):** The kinetic term for a fermion is `L_kinetic_fermion = ψ̄(iγ^μ∂_μ)ψ`. For this term to have a mass dimension of 4, and knowing that the derivative `∂_μ` has a mass dimension of `[∂_μ] = 1`, we can deduce the dimension of `ψ`.\n    `[L_kinetic_fermion] = [ψ̄][∂_μ][ψ] = 2[ψ] + 1 = 4`\n    `2[ψ] = 3`\n    `[ψ] = 3/2`\n    Since `ψ̄` is the Dirac adjoint of `ψ`, it has the same mass dimension: `[ψ̄] = 3/2`.\n\n*   **Electromagnetic Field Strength Tensor (F^μν):** The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is `L_kinetic_EM = -1/4 F_μν F^μν`. For this term to have a mass dimension of 4, we have:\n    `[L_kinetic_EM] = [F^μν]² = 4`\n    `[F^μν] = 2`\n\n*   **Sigma Tensor (σ_μν):** The term `σ_μν` is composed of gamma matrices `γ_μ`, which are dimensionless matrices. Therefore, `σ_μν` is also dimensionless: `[σ_μν] = 0`.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Mass Dimension of κ\n\nNow we can use the total mass dimension of the interaction term to find the dimension of the coupling constant `κ`.\n\n`[L_int] = [κ] + [ψ̄] + [σ_μν] + [ψ] + [F^μν] = 4`\n`[κ] + 3/2 + 0 + 3/2 + 2 = 4`\n`[κ] + 3 + 2 = 4`\n`[κ] + 5 = 4`\n`[κ] = -1`\n\nThe mass dimension of the coupling constant `κ` is -1.\n\n### 4. Renormalizability of the Theory\n\nThe renormalizability of a quantum field theory can be determined by the mass dimension of its coupling constants.\n\n*   If `[coupling] > 0`, the theory is **super-renormalizable**.\n*   If `[coupling] = 0`, the theory is **renormalizable**.\n*   If `[coupling] < 0`, the theory is **non-renormalizable**.\n\nSince the mass dimension of `κ` is -1 (which is less than zero), the interaction is non-renormalizable. This type of term, often associated with phenomena like the anomalous magnetic moment, is typical of an effective field theory, which is not valid at arbitrarily high energies.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe mass dimension of `κ` is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
