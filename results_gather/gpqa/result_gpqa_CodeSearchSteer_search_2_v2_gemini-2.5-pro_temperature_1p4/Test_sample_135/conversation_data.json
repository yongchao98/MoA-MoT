    "To evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the vector field **f**(r), we can use the Divergence Theorem, also known as Gauss's Theorem. This theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field within a closed volume to the surface integral of the flux of the field through the closed surface that encloses the volume.\n\nThe Divergence Theorem is stated as:\n∫∫∫ (∇ ⋅ **f**) dV = ∬ (**f** ⋅ d**S**)\n\nHere, the vector field is given by **f**(r) = (1/r²) **r̂**, where **r̂** is the unit vector in the radial direction. The volume V is a sphere of radius R centered at the origin, and S is the surface of this sphere.\n\nA direct calculation of the divergence (∇ ⋅ **f**) in spherical coordinates for r > 0 gives zero. However, the vector field has a singularity at the origin (r=0) where it is undefined. This singularity acts as a source, and therefore the volume integral of the divergence is not zero.\n\nTo correctly evaluate the integral, we apply the Divergence Theorem by calculating the flux of the vector field through the surface of the sphere.\n\n1.  **Define the vector field on the surface:** On the surface of the sphere of radius R, the radial distance r is constant and equal to R. So, the vector field is **f**(R) = (1/R²) **r̂**.\n\n2.  **Define the differential surface element:** For a sphere, the outward-pointing differential surface element d**S** is given by d**S** = **r̂** R² sin(θ) dθ dφ.\n\n3.  **Calculate the dot product:** The dot product **f** ⋅ d**S** is:\n    **f** ⋅ d**S** = ( (1/R²) **r̂** ) ⋅ ( **r̂** R² sin(θ) dθ dφ )\n    Since **r̂** ⋅ **r̂** = 1 and the R² terms cancel out, this simplifies to:\n    **f** ⋅ d**S** = sin(θ) dθ dφ\n\n4.  **Integrate over the surface of the sphere:** The flux is the integral of this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits of integration for the polar angle θ are from 0 to π, and for the azimuthal angle φ are from 0 to 2π.\n    Flux = ∫ (from φ=0 to 2π) ∫ (from θ=0 to π) sin(θ) dθ dφ\n\n5.  **Evaluate the integral:**\n    ∫ (from 0 to 2π) dφ = 2π\n    ∫ (from 0 to π) sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)] from 0 to π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = 1 - (-1) = 2\n\n    Multiplying these results gives the total flux:\n    Flux = (2π) * (2) = 4π\n\nAccording to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence of the field is equal to this flux. Therefore, the value of the integral is 4π. This result is independent of the radius R, as long as the sphere encloses the singularity at the origin.\n\n<<<D>>>"
