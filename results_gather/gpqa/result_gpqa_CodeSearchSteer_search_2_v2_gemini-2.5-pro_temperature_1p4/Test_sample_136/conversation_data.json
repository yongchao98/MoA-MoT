    "The calculation for the number of revolutions a proton makes in the synchrocyclotron is determined by the total kinetic energy it gains divided by the energy it gains per single revolution.\n\nHere are the details of the calculation:\n\n*   **Total Kinetic Energy (T_final):** The proton reaches a final kinetic energy of 950 MeV, starting from a negligible initial energy.\n*   **Peak Accelerating Voltage (U₀):** The peak voltage of the alternating field is 190 kV.\n*   **Synchronous Phase (Φ₀):** The initial phase is given as π/4. This is the phase at which the proton is synchronized to cross the accelerating gap.\n*   **Energy Gain per Crossing:** In a cyclotron, the particle is accelerated twice per revolution. The energy gained during each crossing of the gap is given by the formula ΔE_cross = e * U₀ * cos(Φ₀), where 'e' is the elementary charge.\n*   **Energy Gain per Revolution:** Since there are two accelerations per revolution, the total energy gain in one full turn is ΔE_rev = 2 * e * U₀ * cos(Φ₀).\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\n*   The energy gain per revolution in electron-volts (eV) is:\n    ΔE_rev = 2 * (190,000 eV) * cos(π/4)\n    ΔE_rev = 380,000 * (√2 / 2) eV\n    ΔE_rev = 190,000 * √2 eV ≈ 268,700 eV or 0.2687 MeV\n\nThe total number of revolutions (N) is then calculated as:\n\n*   N = Total Kinetic Energy / Energy Gain per Revolution\n    N = 950 MeV / (0.190 * √2 MeV)\n    N = 950 / (0.190 * √2)\n    N ≈ 3535.5\n\nRounding this to the nearest whole number gives 3536 revolutions.\n\n<<<C>>>"
