    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Geometry of a Transit**\n    A planet transits a star when its orbit is viewed nearly edge-on. The impact parameter, `b`, is the projected distance between the center of the star and the center of the planet at mid-transit, measured in units of the star's radius (`R_s`).\n    *   `b = 0` for a central transit.\n    *   `b = 1` for a grazing transit, where the center of the planet passes just over the edge of the star.\n\n    For a transit to occur, the impact parameter `b` must be less than or equal to 1 (`b <= 1`). The event is also called a transit if at least part of the planet passes in front of the star. However, the standard definition of the impact parameter relates the centers of the two bodies. For a planet in a circular orbit, if a transit occurs, an occultation (passing behind the star) will also occur.\n\n2.  **Relate Impact Parameter, Inclination, and Orbital Radius**\n    The impact parameter `b` is geometrically related to the semi-major axis of the orbit `a` (which is the orbital radius for a circular orbit), the stellar radius `R_s`, and the orbital inclination `i` (where `i=90°` is a perfectly edge-on orbit). The formula is:\n\n    `b = (a / R_s) * cos(i)`\n\n3.  **Use Information from the First Planet**\n    We are given the following for the first planet:\n    *   Orbital Period (P1) = 3 days\n    *   Impact Parameter (b1) = 0.2\n\n    From the formula above, we have:\n    `0.2 = (a1 / R_s) * cos(i)`\n\n    Since both planets share the same orbital plane, the inclination `i` is the same for both. We can rearrange this equation to find an expression for the constant `cos(i)`:\n    `cos(i) = 0.2 * (R_s / a1)`\n\n4.  **Set the Condition for the Second Planet**\n    We need to find the *maximum* orbital period for the second planet that allows it to transit. A longer period corresponds to a larger semi-major axis (`a`). The largest possible semi-major axis for a transit occurs at the largest possible impact parameter, which is `b=1` (a grazing transit).\n\n    For the second planet at its maximum orbital distance (`a2_max`), we set its impact parameter `b2 = 1`:\n    `1 = (a2_max / R_s) * cos(i)`\n\n    We can also rearrange this for `cos(i)`:\n    `cos(i) = 1 * (R_s / a2_max)`\n\n5.  **Find the Ratio of the Orbital Radii**\n    Now we have two expressions for `cos(i)`. Since `i` is the same for both planets, we can set them equal to each other:\n    `0.2 * (R_s / a1) = 1 * (R_s / a2_max)`\n\n    The stellar radius `R_s` cancels out:\n    `0.2 / a1 = 1 / a2_max`\n\n    Solving for `a2_max`, we find the relationship between the orbital radii of the two planets:\n    `a2_max = a1 / 0.2`\n    `a2_max = 5 * a1`\n\n    This means the maximum orbital radius for the second transiting planet is 5 times the orbital radius of the first planet. The radii of the planets themselves are not needed for this calculation, as the impact parameter is defined by the center of the planet.\n\n6.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law**\n    Kepler's Third Law states that the square of a planet's orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (`a`). For two planets orbiting the same star, the relationship is:\n\n    `(P2 / P1)^2 = (a2 / a1)^3`\n\n    We can solve for the period of the second planet, `P2`:\n    `P2 = P1 * (a2 / a1)^(3/2)`\n\n    Now, substitute the values we know:\n    *   `P1 = 3` days\n    *   `a2_max / a1 = 5`\n\n    `P2_max = 3 * (5)^(3/2)`\n    `P2_max = 3 * sqrt(5^3)`\n    `P2_max = 3 * sqrt(125)`\n    `P2_max ≈ 3 * 11.18`\n    `P2_max ≈ 33.54` days\n\nThe maximum orbital period for the second planet to exhibit transit and occultation events is approximately 33.5 days.\n\n<<<B>>>"
