    "A dominant-negative mutation occurs when the mutant protein product interferes with the function of the wild-type protein. In the case of proteins that must dimerize to function, a common mechanism for this interference is the formation of non-functional heterodimers (a complex of one wild-type protein and one mutant protein).\n\nLet's analyze the options in the context of this mechanism:\n\n*   **A) loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype:** This is incorrect. A dominant-negative mutation results in a loss-of-function phenotype, not a wild-type one. Also, dimerization must occur for the mutant protein to interfere with the wild-type protein.\n*   **B) change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype:** This is incorrect. A dominant-negative mutation is a type of loss-of-function mutation, not a gain-of-function mutation.\n*   **C) protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype:** While some mutations can cause protein aggregation that leads to a loss-of-function, it is not the most direct or universal explanation for a dominant-negative effect in a dimeric protein. The \"poisoning\" of the dimer by the mutant subunit is a more specific mechanism.\n*   **D) protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele:** This is the most likely molecular phenotype. The formation of a heterodimer between the mutant (Y) and the wild-type protein can result in an unstable complex. This unstable complex is often targeted by the cell's quality control machinery for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This degradation effectively removes the functional wild-type protein from the cell, leading to a potent loss-of-function. This process, where the mutant protein causes the degradation of the wild-type protein, is a known mechanism for dominant-negative effects.\n\n<<<D>>>"
