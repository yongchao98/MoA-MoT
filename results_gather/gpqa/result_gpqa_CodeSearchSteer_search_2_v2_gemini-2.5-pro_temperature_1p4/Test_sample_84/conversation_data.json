    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2.\n\n### 1. Equilibrium Temperature Ratio\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its star and its own properties. The formula is:\nT_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\nWhere:\n*   `T_star` is the star's effective temperature.\n*   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n\nTo find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 (T_eq1) and Planet2 (T_eq2), we can set up the following equation:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a₁))^(1/2) * (1 - A₁)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a₂))^(1/2) * (1 - A₂)^(1/4)]\n\nGiven that both planets orbit the same star, `T_star` and `R_star` are identical for both. The problem also states that both planets have the same albedo (A₁ = A₂). Therefore, most terms cancel out, simplifying the ratio to:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (1 / a₁)^(1/2) / (1 / a₂)^(1/2) = (a₂ / a₁)^(1/2)\n\nThe problem now is to determine the ratio of the semi-major axes (a₂ / a₁).\n\n### 2. Relating Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters\nThe periodic Doppler shift (Δλ) in the star's light is caused by its \"wobble\" as the planets orbit it. This shift is related to the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) by the formula:\nK = c * (Δλ / λ₀)\nwhere `c` is the speed of light and `λ₀` is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is given by:\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * (G * M_star / a)^(1/2)\n\nWhere:\n*   `M_p` is the planet's mass.\n*   `M_star` is the star's mass.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes\nWe can rearrange the formula for K to solve for the semi-major axis `a`:\na ≈ G * M_p² / (K² * M_star)\n\nNow, we can find the ratio a₂ / a₁:\na₂ / a₁ = [G * M_p₂² / (K₂² * M_star)] / [G * M_p₁² / (K₁² * M_star)]\n\nThe terms for `G` and `M_star` cancel out, leaving:\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂² / M_p₁²) * (K₁² / K₂²) = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\nThe ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes (K₁ / K₂) can be found directly from the ratio of their Doppler shifts (Δλ):\nK₁ / K₂ = [c * (Δλ₁ / λ₀)] / [c * (Δλ₂ / λ₀)] = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂\n\n### 4. Plugging in the Values\nLet's substitute the given values into the equations:\n\n*   **Mass ratio (M_p₂ / M_p₁):**\n    M_p₂ / M_p₁ = (5 Earth masses) / (7 Earth masses) = 5 / 7\n\n*   **Doppler shift ratio (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂):**\n    Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3 / 4\n    Therefore, K₁ / K₂ = 3 / 4\n\n*   **Ratio of semi-major axes (a₂ / a₁):**\n    a₂ / a₁ = (5 / 7)² * (3 / 4)² = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16) = 225 / 784\n\n### 5. Final Calculation\nFinally, we can calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a₂ / a₁)^(1/2) = (225 / 784)^(1/2) = 15 / 28\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<B>>>"
