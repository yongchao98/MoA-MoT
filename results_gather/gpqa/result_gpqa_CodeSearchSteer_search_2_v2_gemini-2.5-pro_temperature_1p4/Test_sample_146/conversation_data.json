    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Conservation of Energy**\n\nThe annihilation process is given by:\n$p+\\bar{p}\\rightarrow2A^{+}+2A^{-}$\n\n*   **Initial State:** The process starts with a proton ($p$) at rest and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) that is slowly moving. We can assume the kinetic energy of both is negligible. Therefore, the total initial energy ($E_i$) is the sum of their rest mass energies. The rest mass of a proton and an antiproton are identical. The rest energy of a proton is approximately 938 MeV.\n    $E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}}c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2 = 2 \\times 938 \\text{ MeV} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n*   **Final State:** The final state consists of four particles of type A ($2A^+$ and $2A^-$), all having the same mass. The given rest energy for particle A is $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$. Since these particles will be moving at high velocity, their total energy ($E_f$) is the sum of their relativistic energies.\n    $E_f = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\times \\gamma m_A c^2$\n    where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\n*   **Applying the Law of Conservation of Energy:**\n    $E_i = E_f$\n    $1876 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times (300 \\text{ MeV})$\n\n**2. Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**\n\nNow, we solve for $\\gamma$:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1876 \\text{ MeV}}{4 \\times 300 \\text{ MeV}} = \\frac{1876}{1200} \\approx 1.5633$\n\n**3. Calculate the Velocity (v)**\n\nThe Lorentz factor is related to the velocity by the formula:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n\nWe need to rearrange this to solve for the velocity, $v$:\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n$1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nNow, substitute the value of $\\gamma$:\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5633)^2}}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.444}}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - 0.409}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{0.591} \\approx 0.7688$\n\nSo, the velocity of particle A is approximately $0.77c$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 0.96c\nB) 0.86c\nC) 0.77c\nD) 0.91c\n\nThe calculated velocity matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
