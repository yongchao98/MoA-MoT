    "### Chemical Reaction Reagent Analysis\n\nThe correct reagents for the given reactions are identified by understanding the underlying chemical mechanisms for cyanohydrin formation and nitrile hydrolysis.\n\n**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\nThis reaction is a classic example of cyanohydrin formation. The process involves the nucleophilic attack of the cyanide ion (CN⁻) from sodium cyanide (NaCN) on the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This initial attack forms an alkoxide intermediate. To obtain the final product, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, this intermediate must be protonated. Reagent **A** serves as the proton source. An acidic workup, typically represented as H₃O⁺ (hydronium ion, generated from a mineral acid like HCl or H₂SO₄ in water), is used to protonate the alkoxide. Therefore, A = H₃O⁺.\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\nThis transformation is the hydrolysis of a nitrile (specifically, a cyanohydrin) to a carboxylic acid. This reaction can be catalyzed by either acid or base. In an acidic medium, the nitrile is heated, typically under reflux, with a dilute strong acid like hydrochloric acid (HCl) or sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). The strong acid (reagent **B**) protonates the nitrile nitrogen, making the carbon atom more susceptible to nucleophilic attack by water, ultimately leading to the formation of a carboxylic acid and an ammonium ion. Therefore, a strong acid like B = HCl is a suitable reagent.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct set of reagents is A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.\n\n<<<A>>>"
