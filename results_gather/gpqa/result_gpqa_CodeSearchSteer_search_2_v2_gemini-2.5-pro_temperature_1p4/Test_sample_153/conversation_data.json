    "Based on a thorough analysis of the provided spectral data, the unidentified compound is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\nHere is a step-by-step-analysis of the evidence:\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry (MS):** The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 and the M+2 peak at m/z = 158 with a relative intensity of about 32% strongly indicate the presence of a single chlorine atom. The molecular weight of 4-chlorobenzoic acid is 156.57 g/mol, which is consistent with this finding.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:** The spectrum shows a very broad peak between 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ and a strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. The broad absorption is characteristic of the O-H bond in a carboxylic acid, which is broadened due to hydrogen bonding. The peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of the carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy:** The ¹H NMR spectrum provides the most definitive evidence for the structure.\n    *   The singlet at 11.0 ppm, integrating to one proton (1H), is characteristic of a deshielded carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n    *   The two doublets in the aromatic region, one at 8.02 ppm (2H) and another at 7.72 ppm (2H), are indicative of a *para* (1,4) substituted benzene ring. This specific pattern arises because the symmetry of the molecule makes the two protons adjacent to one substituent chemically equivalent to each other, and the same applies to the protons near the other substituent. The result is two signals, each representing two protons, that appear as doublets. The downfield chemical shifts are consistent with an electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group and a chlorine atom attached to the ring.\n\n**Evaluation of Other Options:**\n\n*   **A) Phenyl chloroformate:** This compound lacks the carboxylic acid group, and therefore would not show the broad IR peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ or the ¹H NMR peak at 11.0 ppm.\n*   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** While it has the correct molecular weight and functional groups, the *ortho* substitution would create a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the ¹H NMR spectrum with four distinct signals, not two doublets.\n*   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This structure is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. It would lack the carboxylic acid proton at 11.0 ppm and would instead show an aldehyde proton signal around 9-10 ppm.\n\nTherefore, all spectral data are fully consistent with the structure of 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<C>>>"
