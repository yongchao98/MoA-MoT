    "The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model Lagrangian. These operators are built from the Standard Model fields and must respect certain fundamental symmetries.\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry**: The SMEFT is a relativistic quantum field theory, and its operators are constructed to be Lorentz scalars. This means they are invariant under rotations and boosts, which are fundamental transformations in spacetime. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry must be respected.\n\n2.  **Poincaré Symmetry**: This symmetry group includes Lorentz transformations as well as spacetime translations. As the SMEFT Lagrangian is built to be a Lorentz scalar and does not have explicit dependence on spacetime coordinates, the action is invariant under translations. Thus, Poincaré symmetry is a required symmetry.\n\n3.  **CP Symmetry**: CP (Charge-Parity) symmetry is violated in the Standard Model itself, most notably in the quark sector described by the CKM matrix. The SMEFT is an extension of the Standard Model and can include new sources of CP violation. In fact, numerous studies focus on classifying and constraining these new CP-violating operators in the SMEFT. Therefore, CP symmetry is not a symmetry that must be respected by all operators.\n\n4.  **CPT Symmetry**: The CPT theorem states that any local, unitary, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory must be invariant under the combined transformation of charge conjugation (C), parity inversion (P), and time reversal (T). Since the SMEFT is constructed as such a theory, it must respect CPT symmetry. A violation of CPT would imply a violation of Lorentz invariance.\n\nBased on this, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, and CPT symmetry.\n\n<<<B>>>"
