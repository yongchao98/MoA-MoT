    "To identify the unknown organic compound, the provided ¹H NMR data must be carefully analyzed and compared with the structures of the possible options.\n\n### Analysis of the ¹H NMR Data:\n\n1.  **~2.1 ppm (3H, s):** This signal corresponds to three equivalent protons that have no adjacent protons, resulting in a singlet. The chemical shift at ~2.1 ppm is characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group (an acetyl group, CH₃-C=O). All four possible compounds contain an acetate group, which is consistent with this signal.\n2.  **~1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This signal represents a methyl group (3H) that is split into a doublet (d), indicating it is adjacent to a single proton. This suggests a -CH-CH₃ fragment.\n3.  **~5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This signal is from a single proton (1H) that appears as a doublet of quartets (dq). This means it is coupled to one adjacent proton (causing the doublet) and to a group of three equivalent protons (causing the quartet). This pattern fits a proton on a double bond that is adjacent to another vinyl proton and a methyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃).\n4.  **~7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This signal is from a single proton (1H) on a double bond (vinylic proton) that is split into a doublet by an adjacent proton. The crucial piece of information is the coupling constant (J) of 16.0 Hz. Coupling constants for vinylic protons are stereochemically dependent. A large coupling constant, typically in the range of 11-18 Hz, is characteristic of a *trans* relationship between the two protons. A *cis* relationship would show a smaller coupling constant, generally between 6-15 Hz.\n\n### Structure Elucidation:\n\n*   The signals at ~2.1 ppm and the presence of vinylic protons suggest an acetate ester of an unsaturated alcohol.\n*   The signals at ~7.0 ppm, ~5.5 ppm, and ~1.6 ppm indicate a -CH=CH-CH₃ group (a propenyl group). This eliminates the butenyl acetate options.\n*   The large coupling constant of 16.0 Hz between the two vinylic protons (at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm) strongly indicates that they are in a *trans* configuration.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the evidence:\n*   The presence of an acetyl group (s, 3H at 2.1 ppm).\n*   The presence of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃) identified by the signals at 7.0 ppm (d), 5.5 ppm (dq), and 1.6 ppm (d).\n*   The large coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz) confirming a *trans* configuration of the double bond.\n\nThe unknown compound is identified as **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
