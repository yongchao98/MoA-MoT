    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product, 4, and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms it contains.\n\n### **Step 1: Formation of the Reactive Diene and Diels-Alder Reaction (Product 1)**\n\n1.  **Diene Generation:** 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene is treated with sodium iodide (NaI). This reaction is a known method for generating a highly reactive *o*-xylylene-type intermediate. The two dibromomethyl (-CHBr₂) groups undergo elimination to form exocyclic double bonds. The intermediate formed is **5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene**.\n\n2.  **Diels-Alder Reaction:** This generated diene acts as the diene in a Diels-Alder reaction. The dienophile is 7-(*tert*-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene (a norbornadiene derivative). The *o*-xylylene part of the generated diene (the C=C-C=C system involving the exocyclic double bonds) reacts with one of the double bonds of the norbornadiene derivative. Although two equivalents of the diene precursor are mentioned, this is likely to ensure the reaction proceeds, and the most plausible initial product is the mono-adduct. This cycloaddition forms a complex polycyclic ether, which is **Product 1**.\n\n### **Step 2: Deprotection to form Product 2**\n\nProduct 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a standard acidic condition for the deprotection of a *tert*-butyl ether. The *tert*-butoxy group (-O-tBu) at the C7 position of the norbornane framework is cleaved to form a hydroxyl group (-OH). The resulting alcohol is **Product 2**.\n\n### **Step 3: Oxidation to form Product 3**\n\nProduct 2 is treated with the sulfur trioxide pyridine complex in DMSO (SO₃/pyridine in DMSO). This is a Parikh-Doering oxidation, which is a mild method for oxidizing a secondary alcohol to a ketone. The hydroxyl group at C7 is oxidized to a carbonyl group (C=O). This ketone is **Product 3**.\n\n### **Step 4: Thermal Decomposition to form Product 4**\n\nProduct 3 is heated to 150°C. Diels-Alder reactions are often reversible at elevated temperatures. This thermal step induces a **retro-Diels-Alder reaction**. Product 3 fragments back into the molecules that formed it, but in their modified forms.\n\nThe fragmentation yields two species:\n*   The modified dienophile: **bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one**. This molecule is known to be unstable and readily undergoes a cheletropic elimination at elevated temperatures, extruding a molecule of carbon monoxide (CO) to form the very stable aromatic molecule, **benzene**.\n*   The original diene: **5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene**. Since this is the other major organic fragment from the reversible reaction, it is considered **Product 4**.\n\n### **Determining the Number of Chemically Distinct Hydrogens in Product 4**\n\nThe final product, 4, is **5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene**. To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze its symmetry.\n\nThe structure of 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene is a six-membered ring with double bonds at positions 1-2 and 3-4, and exocyclic double bonds (=CH₂) at positions 5 and 6. The molecule has a C₂ axis of symmetry that passes through the midpoints of the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n\nLet's analyze the protons based on this symmetry:\n1.  **Ring vinyl protons:** The proton at C1 is chemically equivalent to the proton at C4. The proton at C2 is chemically equivalent to the proton at C3. H1 and H2 are not equivalent. This gives **two** distinct signals for the ring protons.\n2.  **Exocyclic methylene protons:** The C₂ axis makes the two methylene groups (=CH₂ at C5 and C6) equivalent. However, within a single methylene group, the two protons are not equivalent. They are in a diastereotopic relationship because of the chirality of the molecule when viewed from the plane of the double bond. Therefore, the two protons on the C5 methylene group are distinct, as are the two on the C6 group. Due to the overall symmetry, there will be one signal for the \"up\" protons on both C5 and C6, and another signal for the \"down\" protons on both C5 and C6. This gives **two** distinct signals for the four exocyclic protons.\n\nCounting the distinct sets of hydrogens:\n*   Set 1: H1 and H4\n*   Set 2: H2 and H3\n*   Set 3: The two \"outer\" methylene protons\n*   Set 4: The two \"inner\" methylene protons\n\nIn total, there are **4** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms in product 4.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
