    "A textile dye that emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV will absorb red light.\n\nTo determine the color of the absorbed light, we must first identify the color of the emitted light and then find its complementary color. The color we perceive is that of the light emitted or reflected by the substance, while the absorbed color is its complement.\n\nFirst, we calculate the wavelength of the emitted light using the energy provided. The relationship between the energy (E) of a photon in electron volts (eV) and its wavelength (λ) in nanometers (nm) is given by the formula:\n\nλ = 1240 / E\n\nGiven the energy of the emitted light is 2.3393 eV, the wavelength is:\n\nλ = 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ 529.68 nm\n\nA wavelength of approximately 530 nm corresponds to green light in the visible spectrum.\n\nThe color of the light absorbed by the organic compound is the complementary color to the light it emits. The complementary color of green is red.\n\nTherefore, the organic compound absorbs red light.\n\n<<<C>>>"
