    "The relationship between the populations of two energy levels in a gas in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) is described by the Boltzmann equation. This is a valid assumption for stellar photospheres.\n\nThe Boltzmann equation can be written as:\n\nN₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * e^-(ΔE / kT)\n\nWhere:\n*   N₂ and N₁ are the number of atoms in the upper and lower energy states, respectively.\n*   g₂ and g₁ are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of those states.\n*   ΔE is the energy difference between the states (E₂ - E₁).\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.380649 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nWe are given the following information:\n1.  The ratio of the number of excited atoms in star 1 is twice the ratio in star 2. This can be expressed as:\n    (N₂ / N₁)₁ = 2 * (N₂ / N₁)₂\n\n2.  The energy difference, ΔE, is approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J. This value is intentionally chosen to be almost identical to the Boltzmann constant, k. Therefore, we can approximate the ratio ΔE / k ≈ 1.\n\nNow, we can set up the equation based on the given information:\n\nFor star 1 (temperature T₁):\n(N₂ / N₁)₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * e^-(ΔE / kT₁)\n\nFor star 2 (temperature T₂):\n(N₂ / N₁)₂ = (g₂ / g₁) * e^-(ΔE / kT₂)\n\nSubstitute these into the relationship from point 1:\n(g₂ / g₁) * e^-(ΔE / kT₁) = 2 * (g₂ / g₁) * e^-(ΔE / kT₂)\n\nThe term for the statistical weights (g₂ / g₁) is the same for both stars (as it concerns the same energy levels of the same element) and cancels out:\ne^-(ΔE / kT₁) = 2 * e^-(ΔE / kT₂)\n\nTo solve for the temperatures, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\nln(e^-(ΔE / kT₁)) = ln(2 * e^-(ΔE / kT₂))\n-ΔE / kT₁ = ln(2) + ln(e^-(ΔE / kT₂))\n-ΔE / kT₁ = ln(2) - (ΔE / kT₂)\n\nNow, rearrange the equation to solve for ln(2):\nln(2) = (ΔE / kT₂) - (ΔE / kT₁)\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁)\n\nCombine the terms in the parenthesis:\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁T₂) ]\n\nUsing the approximation that ΔE / k ≈ 1:\nln(2) = [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁T₂) ]\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
