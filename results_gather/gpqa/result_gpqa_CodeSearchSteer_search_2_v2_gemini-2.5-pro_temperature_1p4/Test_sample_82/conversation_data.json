    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the pH at both points in the titration.\n\n### 1. Initial State and Dilution\n\nFirst, we calculate the new concentration of acetic acid after dilution.\n*   **Initial Moles of Acetic Acid (CH₃COOH):**\n    Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.05 mol/L × 0.02000 L = 0.001 mol\n*   **Total Volume after Dilution:**\n    Volume = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.040 L\n*   **New Concentration of Acetic Acid:**\n    Molarity = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.040 L = 0.025 M\n\n### 2. pH at 25% Titration\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH, forming its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). This creates a buffer solution.\n\n*   **Moles of CH₃COOH reacted:** 0.25 × 0.001 mol = 0.00025 mol\n*   **Moles of CH₃COO⁻ formed:** 0.00025 mol\n*   **Moles of CH₃COOH remaining:** 0.001 mol - 0.00025 mol = 0.00075 mol\n\nWe use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH of the buffer.\n*   **pKa Calculation:** The Ka of acetic acid is given as 1.85x10⁻⁵.\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85x10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   **Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation:**\n    pH = pKa + log ( [CH₃COO⁻] / [CH₃COOH] )\n    pH = 4.733 + log (0.00025 / 0.00075)\n    pH = 4.733 + log (1/3)\n    pH = 4.733 - 0.477\n    pH ≈ 4.256\n\nSo, the pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.\n\n### 3. pH at the Equivalence Point\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been completely neutralized by NaOH to form sodium acetate. The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion (a weak base).\n\n*   **Volume of NaOH to reach equivalence:**\n    Moles of acid = Moles of base\n    0.001 mol = 0.1 mol/L × Volume of NaOH\n    Volume of NaOH = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³\n*   **Total Volume at Equivalence Point:**\n    40.00 cm³ (acid solution) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH solution) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n*   **Concentration of Acetate (CH₃COO⁻):**\n    [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n*   **Hydrolysis of Acetate:**\n    CH₃COO⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ CH₃COOH(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n*   **Kb Calculation:** We need the base dissociation constant (Kb) for acetate.\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0x10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85x10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405x10⁻¹⁰\n*   **OH⁻ Concentration Calculation:** We can set up an equilibrium expression:\n    Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    5.405x10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    Since Kb is very small, we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.\n    x² = 5.405x10⁻¹⁰ × 0.02 = 1.081x10⁻¹¹\n    x = [OH⁻] = √(1.081x10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288x10⁻⁶ M\n*   **pOH and pH Calculation:**\n    pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288x10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n    pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517\n\nSo, the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated pH values are **4.26** at 25% titration and **8.52** at the equivalence point. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
