    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transition and Selection Rules:**\n    The problem asks for the decay route from the initial state \\(|3,0,0\\rangle\\) to the final state \\(|1,0,0\\rangle\\) via two consecutive electric dipole transitions. The selection rules for electric dipole (E1) transitions are:\n    *   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, \\(l\\), must be \\(\\Delta l = \\pm 1\\).\n    *   The change in the magnetic quantum number, \\(m\\), must be \\(\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1\\).\n    *   The principal quantum number, \\(n\\), must decrease for a decay process (\\(n_{final} < n_{initial}\\)).\n\n2.  **First Transition: \\(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle\\)**\n    *   From the initial state \\(|3,0,0\\rangle\\), we have \\(n=3, l=0, m=0\\).\n    *   Applying the selection rule \\(\\Delta l = \\pm 1\\), the intermediate state must have \\(l' = 0 \\pm 1 = 1\\).\n    *   Applying the selection rule \\(\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1\\), the intermediate state can have \\(m' = 0 + (0, \\pm 1) = 0, +1, -1\\).\n    *   For a decay, \\(n' < 3\\). The problem options suggest the intermediate state has \\(n'=2\\), which is a valid decay step.\n    *   Thus, the possible intermediate states are \\(|2,1,-1\\rangle\\), \\(|2,1,0\\rangle\\), and \\(|2,1,1\\rangle\\).\n\n3.  **Second Transition: \\(|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle\\)**\n    Let's check if the transitions from the possible intermediate states to the final state \\(|1,0,0\\rangle\\) are allowed.\n    *   From any of the intermediate states \\(|2,1,m'\\rangle\\), we have \\(n'=2, l'=1\\).\n    *   For the final state \\(|1,0,0\\rangle\\), we have \\(n_{final}=1, l_{final}=0, m_{final}=0\\).\n    *   Check \\(\\Delta l\\): \\(\\Delta l = l_{final} - l' = 0 - 1 = -1\\). This is allowed.\n    *   Check \\(\\Delta m\\): \\(\\Delta m = m_{final} - m' = 0 - m'\\). For this to be allowed (\\(0, \\pm 1\\)), \\(m'\\) must be \\(0, \\mp 1\\). This condition is satisfied for all three possible intermediate states.\n    *   Therefore, all three paths are valid decay routes:\n        *   \\(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle\\)\n        *   \\(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle\\)\n        *   \\(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle\\)\n\n4.  **Calculate the Transition Probabilities:**\n    The probability of the atom taking a specific decay path depends on the transition rate for the first step, from \\(|3,0,0\\rangle\\) to \\(|2,1,m'\\rangle\\). The transition rate is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the dipole matrix element \\(|\\langle 2,1,m' | e\\vec{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2\\).\n\n    The initial state \\(|3,0,0\\rangle\\) is an s-orbital, which is spherically symmetric. Due to this symmetry, there is no preferred direction in space for the emission of the photon. Consequently, the transitions to each of the three degenerate \\(m'\\) sublevels of the \\(l'=1\\) state are equally probable.\n\n    Since there are three equally likely decay channels for the first step, the probability for each individual channel is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n    *   P(\\(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle\\)) = \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\)\n    *   P(\\(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle\\)) = \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\)\n    *   P(\\(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle\\)) = \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\)\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) \\(|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\). The path is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n    *   B) \\(|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\). The path is valid, and the probability is correct.\n    *   C) \\(|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle\\) and \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\). The path is valid, but the probability is incorrect (and there appears to be a typo in the initial state).\n    *   D) \\(|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\). The path is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that presents a valid decay route with the correct probability is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
