    "The question describes a relationship between the number of stars and their parallax. To find out how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range, we need to follow a logical sequence of steps that connects these astronomical concepts.\n\nFirst, it is crucial to understand the relationship between a star's distance and its parallax. Stellar parallax (plx) is the apparent shift in a star's position against a distant background as the Earth orbits the Sun. This angle is inversely proportional to the star's distance (r). For astronomical calculations, this relationship is often simplified to `r = 1/plx`, where r is the distance in parsecs and plx is the parallax angle in arcseconds.\n\nThe problem states that the number of stars (let's denote this as N) varies with parallax as 1/plx⁵. This is generally interpreted in astronomy to mean that the cumulative number of stars within a certain distance `r` (which corresponds to a parallax greater than `plx`) follows this proportionality. So, we can write:\n\nN ∝ (1/plx)⁵\n\nNext, we substitute the relationship between distance and parallax (`r ∝ 1/plx`) into this expression. This allows us to express the cumulative number of stars as a function of distance:\n\nN(r) ∝ r⁵\n\nThe question asks for how the number of stars changes \"per unit range of distance, r\". This quantity is the rate of change of the cumulative number of stars with respect to distance, which can be found by taking the derivative of N(r) with respect to r (`dN/dr`). This derivative represents the number of stars within a thin spherical shell at distance r.\n\nAssuming N(r) = k * r⁵, where k is a constant of proportionality, we can differentiate N(r) with respect to r:\n\ndN/dr = d/dr (k * r⁵) = 5k * r⁴\n\nFrom this result, we can see that the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to the distance raised to the fourth power:\n\ndN/dr ∝ r⁴\n\nTherefore, the number of stars in that region of the sky changes with distance with a proportionality of r⁴.\n\n<<<B>>>"
