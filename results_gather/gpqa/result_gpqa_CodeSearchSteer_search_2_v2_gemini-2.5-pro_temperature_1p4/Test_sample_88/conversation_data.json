    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded hydrogen atom.\n\n**Step 1: Elucidation of Product 1**\n\nThe starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. It is heated with an excess of a strong base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), at a high temperature (240°C). The product is a ketone, as indicated by the characteristic IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹. While the provided ¹H NMR data for Product 1 contains an unusual chemical shift, the reaction conditions are known to convert 1,3-dihaloadamantanes into **protoadamantan-4-one**. This occurs through a complex rearrangement of the adamantane cage. Therefore, Product 1 is identified as protoadamantan-4-one.\n\n**Step 2: Elucidation of Product 2**\n\nProduct 1 (protoadamantan-4-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide. This reagent is characteristic of the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which reduces ketones to alcohols. In this case, protoadamantan-4-one is reduced to protoadamantan-4-ol. However, the subsequent reaction is ozonolysis, which requires the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond. Aluminum isopropoxide is also a Lewis acid, and upon heating, it can catalyze the dehydration of the alcohol. The dehydration of protoadamantan-4-ol yields **protoadamantene** (Product 2).\n\n**Step 3: Elucidation of Product 3**\n\nProduct 2 (protoadamantene) is subjected to ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by a reductive workup with dimethylsulfide (DMS). Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond of protoadamantene. This cleavage opens one of the rings in the tricyclic structure, leading to the formation of a dicarbonyl compound. The product of the ozonolysis of protoadamantene is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-2,6-dione**.\n\n**Step 4: ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\nThe final task is to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in Product 3, bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-2,6-dione.\n\n*   **Most Deshielded Protons:** The most electron-withdrawing groups in the molecule are the two carbonyl groups at positions C2 and C6. The protons alpha to these groups will be the most deshielded. These are the bridgehead protons at C1 and C5.\n*   **Coupling:** Let's consider the proton at C1. It is adjacent to two methylene (CH₂) groups: one at C8 and one at C9. Therefore, the proton at C1 will be coupled to a total of four neighboring protons (two on C8 and two on C9).\n*   **Splitting Pattern:** Coupling to four neighboring protons would theoretically lead to a pentet (or quintet) if all four coupling constants are identical. In the bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane system, the two six-membered rings exist in a flattened chair conformation to alleviate steric strain. This distortion can cause the various dihedral angles between the bridgehead proton and its four neighbors to become similar, resulting in coincidentally equivalent coupling constants. Consequently, the signal often appears as a pentet, a pattern commonly observed for such systems.\n\nTherefore, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in product 3 is a pentet.\n\n<<<C>>>"
