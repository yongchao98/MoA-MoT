    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Define the given parameters:**\n*   Initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus, M*c² = 300 GeV.\n*   The nucleus is initially at rest.\n*   It fissions into two fragments with rest-masses m1 and m2.\n*   The relationship between the fragment masses is m1 = 2 * m2.\n*   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M.\n\n**2. Calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments:**\nFrom the given relationships:\n*   (m1*c²) + (m2*c²) = 0.99 * (M*c²) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV.\n*   Since m1 = 2 * m2, then (m1*c²) = 2 * (m2*c²).\n\nSubstitute the second equation into the first:\n*   2 * (m2*c²) + (m2*c²) = 297 GeV\n*   3 * (m2*c²) = 297 GeV\n*   m2*c² = 99 GeV\n\nNow, find the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (m1):\n*   m1*c² = 2 * (m2*c²) = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV.\n\nSo, the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (m1) is 198 GeV, and for the lighter one (m2) it is 99 GeV.\n\n**3. Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value):**\nThe total kinetic energy (Q) released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy. This energy is converted into the kinetic energies (T1 and T2) of the fragments.\n*   Q = T1 + T2 = (M*c²) - (m1*c² + m2*c²)\n*   Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV.\n\n**4. Calculate T1 using the correct relativistic formulas:**\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, the total momentum of the system is zero. By the law of conservation of momentum, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta.\n*   p1 = p2\n\nThe relativistic relationship between a particle's total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass (m) is E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². The kinetic energy (T) is related to the total energy by E = T + mc².\nTherefore, (T + mc²)² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\nRearranging for momentum gives: (pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²) = T(T + 2mc²).\n\nSince p1 = p2, we have (p1*c)² = (p2*c)².\n*   T1 * (T1 + 2*m1*c²) = T2 * (T2 + 2*m2*c²)\n\nWe know that T2 = 3 GeV - T1. Substitute the known values:\n*   T1 * (T1 + 2 * 198) = (3 - T1) * ((3 - T1) + 2 * 99)\n*   T1 * (T1 + 396) = (3 - T1) * (3 - T1 + 198)\n*   T1² + 396*T1 = (3 - T1) * (201 - T1)\n*   T1² + 396*T1 = 603 - 3*T1 - 201*T1 + T1²\n*   T1² + 396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1 + T1²\n*   396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1\n*   600*T1 = 603\n*   T1_correct = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV.\n\n**5. Calculate T1 using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation:**\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is T = p²/ (2m).\nFrom the conservation of momentum (p1 = p2), we can establish a ratio of the kinetic energies:\n*   T1 / T2 = (p1² / (2*m1)) / (p2² / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1.\n*   Since m1 = 2 * m2, then T1 / T2 = 1/2, which means T2 = 2 * T1.\n\nNow use the total kinetic energy equation:\n*   T1 + T2 = 3 GeV\n*   T1 + 2*T1 = 3 GeV\n*   3*T1 = 3 GeV\n*   T1_classical = 1 GeV.\n\n**6. Find the difference:**\nThe difference is between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation.\n*   Difference = T1_correct - T1_classical\n*   Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV.\n\nConvert the result to MeV:\n*   Difference = 0.005 GeV * (1000 MeV / 1 GeV) = 5 MeV.\n\n<<<D>>>"
