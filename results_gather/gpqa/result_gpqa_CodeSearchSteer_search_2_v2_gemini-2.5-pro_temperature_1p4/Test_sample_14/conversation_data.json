    "The reasoning behind the decision to observe Planet_1 is based on calculating and comparing the transit probabilities of both Planet_1 and Planet_2.\n\nThe geometric probability of a planet transiting its star is approximately the ratio of the star's radius (R_s) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (a), especially for circular orbits. The formula is:\n\n*   *P*<sub>transit</sub> ≈ *R*<sub>s</sub> / *a*\n\nTo compare the transit probabilities of Planet_1 (P<sub>t1</sub>) and Planet_2 (P<sub>t2</sub>), we can set up the following ratio:\n\n*   *P*<sub>t1</sub> / *P*<sub>t2</sub> = (*R*<sub>s1</sub> / *a*<sub>1</sub>) / (*R*<sub>s2</sub> / *a*<sub>2</sub>)\n\nAccording to the information provided, both host stars have the same radius, so R<sub>s1</sub> = R<sub>s2</sub>. This simplifies the ratio to:\n\n*   *P*<sub>t1</sub> / *P*<sub>t2</sub> = *a*<sub>2</sub> / *a*<sub>1</sub>\n\nTo find the ratio of the semi-major axes, we use Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion. The law states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a) and inversely proportional to the mass of the host star (M_s). The relationship can be expressed as:\n\n*   *a*<sup>3</sup> ∝ *P*<sup>2</sup> *M*<sub>s</sub>\n\nFrom this, we can establish a ratio for the semi-major axes of the two planets:\n\n*   (*a*<sub>1</sub> / *a*<sub>2</sub>)<sup>3</sup> = (*P*<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> *M*<sub>s1</sub>) / (*P*<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> *M*<sub>s2</sub>)\n\nThe problem states that:\n*   The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2 (P<sub>1</sub> = P<sub>2</sub> / 3).\n*   The host star of Planet_1 is twice as massive as the host star of Planet_2 (M<sub>s1</sub> = 2 * M<sub>s2</sub>).\n\nBy substituting these values into the equation, we get:\n\n*   (*a*<sub>1</sub> / *a*<sub>2</sub>)<sup>3</sup> = ( (P<sub>2</sub> / 3)<sup>2</sup> * (2 * M<sub>s2</sub>) ) / (P<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> * M<sub>s2</sub>)\n*   (*a*<sub>1</sub> / *a*<sub>2</sub>)<sup>3</sup> = (P<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> / 9 * 2 * M<sub>s2</sub>) / (P<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> * M<sub>s2</sub>)\n*   (*a*<sub>1</sub> / *a*<sub>2</sub>)<sup>3</sup> = 2 / 9\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the semi-major axes is:\n\n*   *a*<sub>1</sub> / *a*<sub>2</sub> = (2 / 9)<sup>1/3</sup>\n\nNow, we can determine the ratio of the transit probabilities:\n\n*   *P*<sub>t1</sub> / *P*<sub>t2</sub> = *a*<sub>2</sub> / *a*<sub>1</sub> = 1 / ( (2/9)<sup>1/3</sup> ) = (9 / 2)<sup>1/3</sup>\n*   *P*<sub>t1</sub> / *P*<sub>t2</sub> = (4.5)<sup>1/3</sup> ≈ 1.65\n\nThis calculation shows that the transit probability of Planet_1 is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. Consequently, the researchers would prioritize observing Planet_1.\n\n<<<A>>>"
