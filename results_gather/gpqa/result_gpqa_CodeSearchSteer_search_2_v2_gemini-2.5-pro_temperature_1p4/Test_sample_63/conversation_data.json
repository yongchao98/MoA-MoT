    "### Step-by-step Solution:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Gas Absorption Data:**\n    *   The mixture of salts A and B is heated and decomposes entirely into a mixture of gases.\n    *   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent used to absorb water (H₂O). The weight of the tube increased by 3.60 g, which is the mass of water produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases like CO₂. The weight of this tube did not change, indicating that no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition.\n    *   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem specifies that CuO was formed and the tube's weight increased by 0.80 g. This mass gain is due to oxygen atoms. The problem's description implies O₂ gas was present, but it's also known that hot copper can react with nitrous oxide (N₂O). The reaction is `Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂`. This reaction also results in the formation of CuO.\n        *   Mass of oxygen atoms (O) that reacted with copper = 0.80 g.\n        *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   **Gas C:** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 liters of gas C remained. At standard temperature and pressure (STP), one mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n        *   This remaining gas is inert to the previous reagents. Given the decomposition of nitrogen-containing salts, Gas C is most likely nitrogen (N₂).\n\n2.  **Identify the Initial Salts and their Decomposition Products:**\n    *   The gaseous products contained Hydrogen (from H₂O), Nitrogen (as N₂ and possibly from N₂O), and Oxygen (in H₂O and transferred to Cu). This means the original salts must be composed of N, H, and O.\n    *   The most common salts containing these elements are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids, namely ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n    *   Let's examine their decomposition reactions at 200°C:\n        *   **Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** Decomposes to nitrogen gas and water. `NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)`\n        *   **Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** At temperatures around 200°C, it primarily decomposes into nitrous oxide (N₂O) and water. `NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)`\n\n3.  **Correlate Products with Experimental Data:**\n    *   Let's assume the initial equimolar mixture contained 'x' moles of NH₄NO₃ (Salt A) and 'x' moles of NH₄NO₂ (Salt B).\n    *   From `x` moles of NH₄NO₃: `x` moles of N₂O and `2x` moles of H₂O are produced.\n    *   From `x` moles of NH₄NO₂: `x` moles of N₂ and `2x` moles of H₂O are produced.\n    *   **Total products before passing through tubes:**\n        *   Total H₂O = `2x + 2x = 4x` moles.\n        *   Total N₂O = `x` moles.\n        *   Total N₂ = `x` moles.\n    *   Now, let's trace these gases through the tubes:\n        *   **Tube 1:** Absorbs `4x` moles of H₂O. From the experiment, we know this is 0.20 mol.\n            *   `4x = 0.20 mol`  => `x = 0.05 mol`.\n        *   **Tube 3:** The hot copper reacts with the `x` moles of N₂O. In the reaction `Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂`, `x` moles of N₂O transfer `x` moles of oxygen atoms to the copper.\n            *   From the experiment, moles of O atoms = 0.05 mol.\n            *   Therefore, `x = 0.05 mol`. This is consistent with our first calculation.\n            *   This reaction also produces `x` moles of new N₂ gas.\n        *   **Gas C (Final Gas):** The final gas is the sum of the original N₂ and the N₂ produced from the N₂O reaction.\n            *   Total N₂ = (original N₂) + (N₂ from N₂O) = `x + x = 2x` moles.\n            *   Using our value of `x = 0.05`, the total moles of N₂ should be `2 * 0.05 = 0.10` mol.\n            *   This perfectly matches the experimental finding of 0.10 mol for Gas C.\n\n4.  **Verify the Mass and Identify the Salts:**\n    *   The hypothesis holds. The mixture consisted of 0.05 moles of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 moles of NH₄NO₂.\n    *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.04 g/mol.\n    *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.04 g/mol.\n    *   Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 0.05 mol * 80.04 g/mol = 4.002 g.\n    *   Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 0.05 mol * 64.04 g/mol = 3.202 g.\n    *   Total Mass = 4.002 g + 3.202 g = 7.204 g. This matches the initial weight of 7.20 g.\n    *   Thus, Salt A is NH₄NO₃ and Salt B is NH₄NO₂.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms:**\n    *   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 3 Oxygen atoms.\n        *   Total atoms in NH₄NO₃ = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n    *   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 2 Oxygen atoms.\n        *   Total atoms in NH₄NO₂ = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n    *   **Total atoms in both salts A and B:**\n        *   Total = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17 atoms.\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is 17.\n\n<<<B>>>"
