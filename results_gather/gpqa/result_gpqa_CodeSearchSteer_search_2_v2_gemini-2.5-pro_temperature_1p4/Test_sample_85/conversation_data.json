    "To determine the correct starting materials for both reactions, we must analyze the reagents' selectivity and the stereochemical outcome.\n\n### **Analysis of the Reactions**\n\nThe starting material in the options is a derivative of 3-ethylglutaric acid, specifically an ester-acid with the chemical structure HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu. This molecule has a single chiral center at the third carbon (C3).\n\nThe product in both reactions is a six-membered cyclic ester (a lactone), specifically 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This product has a chiral center at the fourth carbon (C4). The reactions involve reduction and subsequent cyclization. Crucially, none of the reaction steps affect the chiral center itself, meaning the stereochemical configuration (R or S) of the starting material will be retained in the product.\n\n*   **An (R)-configured starting material will produce an (R)-configured product.**\n*   **An (S)-configured starting material will produce an (S)-configured product.**\n\n### **Reaction A: Reduction with LiBH₄**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) followed by an acid workup (H⁺).\n*   **Product:** (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\nLiBH₄ is a reducing agent known to selectively reduce esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. Therefore, it will reduce the isobutoxy ester group at one end of the molecule to a primary alcohol. The subsequent acid workup catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) where the newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the carboxylic acid at the other end. This process forms the observed six-membered lactone.\n\nSince the product has the (R) configuration, the starting material A must also have the (R) configuration. Thus, **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Reaction B: Reduction with BH₃**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Borane (BH₃) followed by an acid workup (H⁺).\n*   **Product:** (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\nBorane is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids in the presence of esters. It will reduce the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol. The intermediate is a hydroxy-ester. In the acid workup step, there are two possibilities: intramolecular transesterification to form a seven-membered lactone, or hydrolysis of the ester followed by lactonization. Given that the product is a six-membered lactone, the latter pathway must occur: the acid workup hydrolyzes the isobutyl ester to a carboxylic acid, creating the same 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid intermediate as in Reaction A, which then cyclizes to form the six-membered lactone.\n\nAs the final product has the (S) configuration, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration. Thus, **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material A is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material B is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
