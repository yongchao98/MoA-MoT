    "The process for determining the correct IUPAC name for this complex substituted benzene molecule involves several key steps based on established nomenclature rules.\n\n### 1. Identify the Principal Functional Group\n\nFirst, the principal functional group must be identified to determine the parent name of the molecule. According to IUPAC priority rules, the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) has the highest priority among all the listed functional groups (carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, cyano, hydroxyl, dimethylamino, methoxy). Therefore, the molecule is named as a derivative of benzoic acid, and the carbon atom attached to the carboxylic acid group is designated as position C1.\n\n### 2. Determine the Structure from Positional Information\n\nThe positions of the other substituents are determined relative to the C1 carbon:\n*   **Carbaldehyde (-CHO, or formyl) and Cyano (-CN) groups:** These are described as being \"meta to one another\" along with the carboxylic acid. This implies a 1,3,5-substitution pattern. With the carboxylic acid at C1, the formyl and cyano groups must be at C3 and C5.\n*   **Hydroxyl (-OH) and Dimethylamino [-N(CH₃)₂] groups:** These are \"ortho to the carboxylic acid,\" placing them at C2 and C6.\n*   **Methoxy (-OCH₃) group:** This is \"para to the carboxylic acid,\" placing it at C4.\n*   **Confirmation of Cyano/Formyl Positions:** A crucial piece of information is that \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile (the cyano group).\"\n    *   If the cyano group were at C3, its ortho positions would be C2 and C4. At C2 and C4, we would have one of the ortho groups (hydroxyl or dimethylamino) and the methoxy group. This does not fit the description.\n    *   If the cyano group is at C5, its ortho positions are C4 and C6. Placing the methoxy group at C4 and the hydroxyl group at C6 perfectly matches this description. Consequently, the formyl group must be at C3, and the dimethylamino group must be at C2.\n\nThis leads to the following structure:\n*   **C1:** -COOH (Carboxylic acid)\n*   **C2:** -N(CH₃)₂ (Dimethylamino)\n*   **C3:** -CHO (Formyl)\n*   **C4:** -OCH₃ (Methoxy)\n*   **C5:** -CN (Cyano)\n*   **C6:** -OH (Hydroxyl)\n\n### 3. Numbering the Substituents\n\nWith the parent group at C1, numbering can proceed either clockwise or counter-clockwise. In this case, both directions result in the same set of locants (positions): 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. When such a tie occurs, IUPAC rules state that the numbering should be assigned to give the lowest locant to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\nThe substituents are: cyano, **d**imethylamino, **f**ormyl, **h**ydroxy, and **m**ethoxy.\n\n*   Numbering counter-clockwise assigns position 2 to the **d**imethylamino group and 6 to the **h**ydroxy group.\n*   Numbering clockwise would assign position 2 to the **h**ydroxy group and 6 to the **d**imethylamino group.\n\nSince \"dimethylamino\" comes before \"hydroxy\" alphabetically, the counter-clockwise numbering is correct. This confirms the positions deduced in the previous step.\n\n### 4. Assembling the Final Name\n\nThe final step is to list the substituents alphabetically, preceded by their locants, and followed by the parent name.\n\nThe alphabetized substituents are:\n*   5-cyano\n*   2-(dimethylamino)\n*   3-formyl\n*   6-hydroxy\n*   4-methoxy\n\nCombining these in order gives the full IUPAC name: **5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\nThis name corresponds exactly to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
