    "In a universe where isolated magnetic north or south poles, known as magnetic monopoles, could exist, two of Maxwell's fundamental equations of electromagnetism would be altered.\n\nCurrently, Gauss's law for magnetism dictates that the divergence of the magnetic field (∇·B) is zero. This is the mathematical expression of the fact that magnetic monopoles have never been observed; magnetic field lines are always closed loops, never starting from or ending on a single point. If a magnetic monopole existed, it would act as a source or sink for the magnetic field, much like an electric charge is for the electric field. Consequently, Gauss's law for magnetism would be modified to state that the divergence of the magnetic field is equal to the magnetic charge density (ρm).\n\nAdditionally, Faraday's law of induction, which describes how a changing magnetic field creates a circulating electric field (∇×E = -∂B/∂t), would also be modified. The movement of magnetic monopoles would constitute a \"magnetic current\" (Jm). This magnetic current would induce a circulating electric field, adding another term to Faraday's law. Therefore, the equation for the circulation (or curl) of the electric field would also be different.\n\nThe other two of Maxwell's equations, Gauss's law for electricity and the Ampère-Maxwell law, relate the electric and magnetic fields to electric charges and currents and would not be changed by the existence of magnetic monopoles.\n\nThus, the two equations that would be different are the one related to the divergence of the magnetic field and the one related to the circulation of the electric field.\n\n<<<A>>>"
