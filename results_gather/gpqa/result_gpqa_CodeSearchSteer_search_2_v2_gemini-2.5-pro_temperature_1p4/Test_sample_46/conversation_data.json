    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula to calculate the DoU is C - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    *   DoU = 9 - (11/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 9 - 5.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n*   A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### 2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** These two distinct, medium-to-strong intensity bands are highly characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption band falls squarely in the region for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Given the presence of oxygen in the formula and a likely benzene ring, this is indicative of an aromatic ester or ketone. The value is a very good fit for an aromatic ester.\n\n### 3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents 3 protons, indicating a methyl (CH₃) group. The triplet multiplicity (`t`) means it is adjacent to a carbon with 2 protons (a CH₂ group), according to the n+1 rule. This suggests an ethyl (-CH₂CH₃) fragment.\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal for 2 protons is a quartet (`q`), which means it is adjacent to a carbon with 3 protons (a CH₃ group). This confirms the ethyl (-CH₂CH₃) fragment. The significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm indicates that this CH₂ group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, almost certainly an oxygen atom, as in an ester (-O-CH₂CH₃).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for 2 protons is very characteristic of the -NH₂ protons of a primary amine. The broadness is due to factors like quadrupole coupling and chemical exchange. This confirms the primary amine found in the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. Having two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is the classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two sets of protons are on opposite sides of the ring, and they split each other into doublets. The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing ester group, while the upfield signal at 7.0 ppm is adjacent to the electron-donating amine group.\n\n### 4. Assembling the Structure\n\nBased on the analysis of all the data:\n*   We have a **primary amine (-NH₂)** group.\n*   We have an **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)** group.\n*   These two groups are attached to a **benzene ring** in a **1,4 (para) arrangement**.\n\nThis leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n### 5. Evaluating the Options\n\n*   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Would have a secondary amide N-H (one IR band), not a primary amine. The NMR would be different.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** The structure is consistent with all the spectroscopic data. Published ¹H NMR data for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate shows a triplet at ~1.35 ppm (3H), a broad singlet for the amine at ~4.16 ppm (2H), a quartet at ~4.31 ppm (2H), and two doublets in the aromatic region at ~6.62 ppm (2H) and ~7.84 ppm (2H). These values are very close to the data provided and confirm the identification.\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a primary amide on a *meta*-substituted ring. The aromatic NMR pattern would be more complex than two doublets.\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer with the ester linkage reversed. The ethyl group would be part of a propionate chain (-COCH₂CH₃). The quartet for the CH₂ group would be around 2.5-2.8 ppm, not the 4.5 ppm observed, which is characteristic of a CH₂ attached to an oxygen.\n\nThe evidence conclusively points to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>"
