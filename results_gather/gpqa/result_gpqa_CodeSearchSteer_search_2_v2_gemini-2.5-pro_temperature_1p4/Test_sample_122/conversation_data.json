    "This problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation. Here is the step-by-step solution:\n\n### 1. Identify the Frames of Reference and Given Information\n\n*   **Ejecta's Reference Frame (S'):** This is the moving frame of reference. The time measured in this frame is the \"proper time\" (Δt₀), as it is the frame where the clock (the ejecta) is at rest.\n    *   Proper time (Δt₀) = 50 s\n*   **Galaxy's Reference Frame (S):** This is considered the stationary frame of reference. We need to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured from this frame.\n*   **Relative Velocity (v):** The speed of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy is 60,000 km/s.\n*   **Speed of Light (c):** For calculations, the speed of light is approximately 300,000 km/s.\n\n### 2. Understand Time Dilation\n\nAccording to the theory of special relativity, an observer in a stationary frame will measure time passing more slowly for a moving object. This effect is called time dilation. The time that passes in the Galaxy's frame (Δt) will be longer than the 50 seconds that pass in the ejecta's frame.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)\n\nThe amount of time dilation is determined by the Lorentz factor, represented by the Greek letter gamma (γ). The formula for the Lorentz factor is:\n\n**γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)**\n\nFirst, let's find the ratio of the velocity to the speed of light:\n*   v / c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2\n\nNow, plug this into the Lorentz factor formula:\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²)\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.04)\n*   γ = 1 / √(0.96)\n*   γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798\n*   γ ≈ 1.0206\n\n### 4. Calculate the Dilated Time (Δt)\n\nThe time measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (Δt) is related to the proper time (Δt₀) by the following equation:\n\n**Δt = γ * Δt₀**\n\nUsing the values we have:\n*   Δt ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s\n*   Δt ≈ 51.03 s\n\nSo, while 50 seconds pass for the ejecta, an observer in the Galaxy's reference frame would measure about 51.03 seconds passing.\n\n### 5. Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Reference Frame\n\nFinally, to find the distance (d) traveled by the ejecta as measured from the Galaxy, we use the standard distance formula with the dilated time:\n\n**d = v * Δt**\n\n*   d ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s\n*   d ≈ 3,061,800 km\n\nThis value is closest to the provided option B.\n\nAlternatively, the distance can be calculated without rounding intermediate steps:\nd = v * (γ * Δt₀) = 60,000 * (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 = 3,000,000 / √(0.96) ≈ 3,061,862 km.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\n*   A) 3,000,000 km (This would be the answer without considering time dilation)\n*   B) 3,060,000 km\n*   C) 2,940,000 km\n*   D) 2,880,000 km\n\nThe calculated distance of approximately 3,061,862 km is closest to 3,060,000 km.\n\n<<<B>>>"
