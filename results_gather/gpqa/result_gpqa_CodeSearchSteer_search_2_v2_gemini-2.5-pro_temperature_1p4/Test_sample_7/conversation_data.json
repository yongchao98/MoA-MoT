  "question": "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n\nA) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nB) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1\nC) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1\nD) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>",

    "To determine the relationship between genes G1, G2, and G3 based on the provided knockout experiment data, a careful analysis of the phenotypes of single and double mutants is required.\n\n### Analysis of the Data:\n\n1.  **Single Mutant Phenotypes:**\n    *   **Wild-type (Control):** 100% resistance.\n    *   **g1 mutant:** 75% resistance. The loss of G1 causes a partial loss of resistance.\n    *   **g2 mutant:** 0% resistance. The loss of G2 completely abolishes resistance, indicating it plays a critical and essential role in the pathway.\n    *   **g3 mutant:** 50% resistance. The loss of G3 causes a significant loss of resistance, more so than the loss of G1.\n\n2.  **Double Mutant Phenotypes (Gene Interactions):**\n    *   **g1g2 mutant:** 0% resistance. This phenotype is identical to the `g2` single mutant. When a double mutant exhibits the phenotype of one of the single mutants, it is known as epistasis. In this case, the `g2` mutation masks the effect of the `g1` mutation. This indicates that G2 is epistatic to G1, which strongly suggests that G2 functions upstream of G1 in the same pathway. Because G2 is known to be a transcription factor, a likely scenario is that G2 is required to activate the expression of G1.\n    *   **g2g3 mutant:** 0% resistance. Similarly, this phenotype is identical to the `g2` single mutant phenotype. This means G2 is also epistatic to G3, suggesting G2 is an upstream regulator of G3 as well.\n    *   **g1g3 mutant:** 10% resistance. This phenotype is more severe than either of the single mutant phenotypes (`g1` at 75% and `g3` at 50%). When the combination of two mutations leads to a more severe phenotype than expected from their individual effects, it's known as a synergistic interaction or negative/aggravating epistasis. This suggests that G1 and G3 likely function in two separate, parallel pathways that both contribute to overall resistance. The loss of both pathways results in an almost complete loss of function.\n\n### Evaluating the Conclusions:\n\n*   **Is G2 a transcription factor?** Yes. The fact that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3 and its knockout leads to a complete loss of resistance makes it the strongest candidate for an upstream transcription factor that regulates both G1 and G3.\n*   **What is the relationship between G1 and G3?** They exhibit a synergistic interaction, suggesting they contribute to resistance through parallel mechanisms. The term \"gene redundancy\" can describe a situation where two genes perform similar or overlapping functions, often in parallel pathways. The loss of one is compensated partially by the other, while the loss of both is much more severe. This fits the observed phenotypes. In contrast, pleiotropy means one gene affects multiple traits, which cannot be determined from this experiment.\n*   **Is G1 epistatic towards G3?** No. The `g1g3` double mutant phenotype (10% resistance) is not the same as the `g1` single mutant phenotype (75%). Therefore, G1 is not epistatic to G3.\n\n### Reviewing the Options:\n\n*   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** This option correctly identifies G2 as the transcription factor and provides a plausible, if broad, description of the G1/G3 interaction as redundancy. However, it incorrectly states that G1 is epistatic towards G3.\n*   **B) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1:** This incorrectly identifies G1 as the transcription factor.\n*   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1:** We cannot conclude they have the same promoter from this data, and it incorrectly states that G3 is epistatic towards G1.\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** This option incorrectly claims pleiotropy and an incorrect epistatic relationship between G1 and G3.\n\nDespite the fact that option A incorrectly describes the epistatic relationship between G1 and G3, it is the most accurate choice overall. It correctly identifies the upstream transcription factor (G2) and uses the most appropriate term among the choices (\"gene redundancy\") to describe the synergistic relationship between G1 and G3, which function in parallel. The other options contain more significant errors.\n\n<<<A>>>"
