    "To solve this problem, we use the method of images. A charge `q` placed at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R` induces charges on the surface of the sphere. The electric field outside the sphere is equivalent to the field produced by the original charge `q` and an \"image charge\" `q'` located inside the sphere.\n\n1.  **Determine the image charge and its position:**\n    For a grounded conducting sphere, the image charge `q'` is given by:\n    `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n\n    This image charge is located at a distance `b` from the center of the sphere, along the line connecting the center and the charge `q`. The distance `b` is:\n    `b = R² / d`\n\n2.  **Calculate the potential energy:**\n    The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from an infinite distance to the distance `d` from the center of the sphere. An important concept in the method of images for conductors is that the potential energy is half the interaction energy between the real charge and the image charge. This is because the induced charge on the conductor is built up as the real charge is brought in, so we must not double-count the energy.\n\n    The potential energy `U` is given by `U = (1/2) * q * V_image`, where `V_image` is the potential at the location of the charge `q` due to the image charge `q'`.\n\n    The distance between the charge `q` and the image charge `q'` is `d - b`.\n    `d - b = d - R²/d = (d² - R²) / d`\n\n    The potential `V_image` at the position of `q` due to `q'` is:\n    `V_image = k * q' / (d - b)`\n    Substituting the expressions for `q'` and `(d - b)`:\n    `V_image = k * [-q * (R/d)] / [(d² - R²) / d]`\n    `V_image = -k * q * R / (d² - R²) `\n\n    Now, we can calculate the potential energy `U`:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_image`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d² - R²)]`\n    `U = -(1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\n    Alternatively, we can calculate the work done by integrating the force on the charge `q` as it is brought from infinity to the distance `d`. The force `F` on charge `q` at a distance `x` from the center is the force exerted by the image charge:\n    `F(x) = k * q * q' / (x - b)² = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R²/x)² = -k * q² * R * x / (x² - R²)²`\n\n    The work done `W` (which is the potential energy `U`) is the integral of the external force, `-F(x)`, from infinity to `d`:\n    `U = ∫(from ∞ to d) -F(x) dx = ∫(from ∞ to d) [k * q² * R * x / (x² - R²)²] dx`\n    `U = k * q² * R * [-1 / (2 * (x² - R²))]` evaluated from `∞` to `d`.\n    `U = k * q² * R * [(-1 / (2 * (d² - R²))) - (-1 / (2 * (∞ - R²)))]`\n    `U = k * q² * R * [-1 / (2 * (d² - R²))]`\n    `U = -(1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. Comparing this with the given options:\n\nA) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\nB) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\nC) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\nD) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nThe calculated potential energy matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
