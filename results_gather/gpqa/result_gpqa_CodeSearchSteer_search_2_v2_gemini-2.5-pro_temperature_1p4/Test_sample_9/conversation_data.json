    "To determine which exoplanet has the highest density, we must analyze the physical properties of each option. The key principle at play is gravitational compression: for planets with the same composition, a more massive planet will have a higher density due to its own gravity compressing its material.\n\nHere is a breakdown of each option:\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is essentially Earth, which has a known average density of about 5.51 g/cm³.\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is explicitly stated as being approximately 5.5 g/cm³.\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** Because it shares Earth's composition but has significantly more mass, this \"super-Earth\" would experience much stronger gravitational compression. This compression forces the material into a smaller volume than it would otherwise occupy, resulting in a density significantly higher than Earth's.\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** With the same composition but less mass, this planet would be subject to weaker gravitational compression than Earth. Consequently, its material would be less compacted, and its overall density would be lower than Earth's.\n\n**Comparison:**\n*   Planet (a): ~5.51 g/cm³\n*   Planet (b): ~5.5 g/cm³\n*   Planet (c): > 5.51 g/cm³ (due to greater mass and compression)\n*   Planet (d): < 5.51 g/cm³ (due to lower mass and less compression)\n\nBy comparing the options, the planet that is five times more massive than Earth (c) will be the densest.\n\n<<<C>>>"
