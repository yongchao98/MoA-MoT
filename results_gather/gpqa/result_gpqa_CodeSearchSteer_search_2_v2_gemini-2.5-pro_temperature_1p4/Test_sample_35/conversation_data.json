    "The observation is of the highly redshifted 21-centimeter (21-cm) line of neutral atomic hydrogen. Here is a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\nFirst, we must determine the original energy of the absorption line before it was redshifted by the expansion of the universe. The observed energy is 3.9 x 10⁻⁶ eV from a source at a distance of 2.1 Gpc.\n\n1.  **Calculate Redshift (z):** Using Hubble's Law (v = H₀ * D) and a typical Hubble constant (H₀) of ~70 km/s/Mpc, the recessional velocity of an object at 2.1 Gpc (2100 Mpc) can be estimated. This velocity corresponds to a redshift (z) of approximately 0.5.\n\n2.  **Calculate Rest-Frame Energy:** The energy of light is decreased (redshifted) by a factor of (1+z) as it travels through the expanding universe. Therefore, the original, or \"rest-frame,\" energy of the absorption line is the observed energy multiplied by (1+z).\n    *   *E_rest* = (3.9 x 10⁻⁶ eV) * (1 + 0.5) ≈ 5.85 x 10⁻⁶ eV.\n\n3.  **Identify the Transition:** This rest-frame energy of approximately 5.87 µeV corresponds to the well-known 21-cm spectral line. This line is produced by a transition in the ground state of neutral, solitary hydrogen atoms (H I). This radiation is fundamental to radio astronomy as it can pass through interstellar dust clouds that obscure visible light, allowing for the mapping of hydrogen gas throughout galaxies.\n\n4.  **Characterize the Interstellar Medium:** The question asks what is most likely to be observed with this absorption line in the Milky Way. The 21-cm line is a key tracer of the atomic interstellar medium (ISM). The ISM has multiple phases with different temperatures.\n    *   **Cold Neutral Medium (CNM):** Has typical temperatures around 100 K and is relatively dense.\n    *   **Warm Neutral Medium (WNM):** Has temperatures around 6000-8000 K and is less dense.\n\nWhile both the warm and cold neutral media contain atomic hydrogen, absorption lines are primarily used to study the cold component. The strength of an absorption line depends on the temperature of the gas; colder gas produces a stronger and more easily detectable absorption feature. Therefore, observations of 21-cm absorption are most sensitive to the cold atomic interstellar medium.\n\n<<<D>>>"
