    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Normalize the Initial State**\n\nThe initial state of the system is given by the column matrix `|ψ⟩`:\n```\n|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]^T\n```\nFirst, we need to normalize this state vector. The squared norm `⟨ψ|ψ⟩` is calculated as:\n`⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`\n\nThe normalization factor is `1/√6`. Therefore, the normalized state `|ψ_norm⟩` is:\n```\n|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]^T\n```\n\n**2. Find the Eigenvector of P for the Eigenvalue 0**\n\nThe operator P is given by the matrix:\n```\nP = [[0, 1/√2, 0],\n     [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],\n     [0, 1/√2, 0]]\n```\nWe need to find the eigenvector `|v_p0⟩` corresponding to the eigenvalue `p = 0`. This is done by solving the equation `P|v⟩ = 0|v⟩`, which simplifies to `P|v⟩ = 0`. Let `|v⟩ = [x, y, z]^T`:\n```\n[[0, 1/√2, 0],\n [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],\n [0, 1/√2, 0]] * [x, y, z]^T = [0, 0, 0]^T\n```\nThis gives us the following system of equations:\n1.  `(1/√2)y = 0`  => `y = 0`\n2.  `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0` => `x + z = 0` => `z = -x`\n\nIf we choose `x = 1`, then `z = -1`. The unnormalized eigenvector is `[1, 0, -1]^T`.\n\nNow, we normalize this eigenvector:\nThe squared norm is `1² + 0² + (-1)² = 2`.\nThe normalized eigenvector `|v_p0⟩` is:\n```\n|v_p0⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]^T\n```\n\n**3. Calculate the Probability of Measuring P = 0**\n\nThe probability of measuring the eigenvalue `p = 0` is the squared magnitude of the projection of the normalized initial state `|ψ_norm⟩` onto the eigenvector `|v_p0⟩`.\n`Prob(P=0) = |⟨v_p0|ψ_norm⟩|²`\n\nFirst, calculate the inner product `⟨v_p0|ψ_norm⟩`:\n`⟨v_p0|ψ_norm⟩ = [(1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]] * [(1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]^T]`\n`= (1/√12) * (1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1)`\n`= (1/√12) * (-1 - 1) = -2/√12 = -2/(2√3) = -1/√3`\n\nNow, square the result to get the probability:\n`Prob(P=0) = (-1/√3)² = 1/3`\n\n**4. Determine the State After Measuring P = 0**\n\nAfter measuring `P = 0`, the state of the system collapses to the corresponding normalized eigenvector, `|v_p0⟩`.\nThe new state of the system `|ψ'⟩` is:\n`|ψ'⟩ = |v_p0⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]^T`\n\n**5. Find the Eigenvector of Q for the Eigenvalue -1**\n\nThe operator Q is given by the diagonal matrix:\n```\nQ = [[1, 0, 0],\n     [0, 0, 0],\n     [0, 0, -1]]\n```\nThe eigenvalues of a diagonal matrix are its diagonal elements: `1, 0, -1`. The corresponding normalized eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors. The eigenvector `|v_q-1⟩` for the eigenvalue `q = -1` is:\n```\n|v_q-1⟩ = [0, 0, 1]^T\n```\n\n**6. Calculate the Probability of Measuring Q = -1**\n\nNow we measure Q in the new state `|ψ'⟩`. The probability of obtaining the result `q = -1` is the squared magnitude of the projection of `|ψ'⟩` onto `|v_q-1⟩`.\n`Prob(Q=-1 after P=0) = |⟨v_q-1|ψ'⟩|²`\n\nCalculate the inner product `⟨v_q-1|ψ'⟩`:\n`⟨v_q-1|ψ'⟩ = [[0, 0, 1]] * [(1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]^T]`\n`= (1/√2) * (0*1 + 0*0 + 1*(-1))`\n`= -1/√2`\n\nSquare the result for the probability:\n`Prob(Q=-1 after P=0) = (-1/√2)² = 1/2`\n\n**7. Calculate the Total Probability**\n\nThe probability of the sequence of events (measuring `P=0` and then `Q=-1`) is the product of the individual probabilities:\n`Prob(P=0 and then Q=-1) = Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1 after P=0)`\n`Prob(Total) = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6`\n\nThus, the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q is 1/6.\n\n<<<A>>>"
