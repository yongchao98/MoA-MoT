    "### Analysis of Spectral Data\n\n1.  **Molecular Features from FTIR and General Information:**\n    *   The compound has a **di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring** (a benzene ring, C₆H₄, with two substituents).\n    *   The FTIR spectrum shows absorption peaks for an **ester group** (-COO-), which contains two oxygen atoms. This is consistent with the O₂ in all the proposed chemical formulas.\n\n2.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (three double bonds and one ring).\n    *   An ester group (C=O) accounts for 1 degree of unsaturation.\n    *   The ¹H NMR shows vinyl-H signals, which indicate a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), accounting for another degree of unsaturation.\n    *   The total minimum DoU is 4 (ring) + 1 (C=O) + 1 (C=C) = 6.\n\n3.  **Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Six total signals** indicate six chemically distinct sets of protons.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has four aromatic protons. Having only two signals suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, like a para-substituted (1,4) ring, where protons on opposite sides are chemically equivalent.\n    *   **No signals for -CH₂ groups:** This is a crucial constraint, ruling out fragments like ethyl (-CH₂CH₃) or any longer alkyl chains.\n    *   **Two signals for -CH₃ groups:** There are two distinct methyl groups in the molecule.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H:** One signal is a doublet, and the other is a doublet of quartets. This splitting pattern is a classic indicator of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃).\n        *   The proton on one side of the double bond is split only by the other vinyl proton, resulting in a doublet.\n        *   The other vinyl proton is split by the first vinyl proton (giving a doublet) and by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (giving a quartet). This combination results in a doublet of quartets.\n        *   This fragment accounts for the two vinyl-H signals and one of the -CH₃ signals. The formula for this propenyl group is C₃H₅.\n\n4.  **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   We have a benzene ring core (C₆H₄).\n    *   One substituent is the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃), with the formula C₃H₅.\n    *   The second substituent must contain the ester group (-COO-) and the second methyl group (-CH₃), with no methylene (-CH₂) groups. The two possibilities are a methyl ester group (-COOCH₃) or an acetate group attached through oxygen (-OCOCH₃). Both have the formula C₂H₃O₂.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Chemical Formula:**\n    *   Combining the fragments: Aromatic ring (C₆H₄) + Propenyl group (C₃H₅) + Ester/Methyl fragment (C₂H₃O₂).\n    *   Total Carbon atoms: 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n    *   Total Hydrogen atoms: 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n    *   Total Oxygen atoms: 2\n    *   The resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n6.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) C₁₂H₁₄O₂:** DoU = 6. Compared to C₁₁H₁₂O₂, this has an extra CH₂, which is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data.\n    *   **B) C₁₁H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6. This matches the unsaturation calculated from the spectral features and is the formula derived from our structural analysis.\n    *   **C) C₁₂H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 7. This implies an additional ring or double bond, which is inconsistent with the NMR data, especially the \"no -CH₂-\" rule.\n    *   **D) C₁₁H₁₄O₂:** DoU = 5. This formula lacks the unsaturation for a C=C double bond, but the NMR clearly shows vinyl protons, confirming a C=C bond is present. Therefore, this formula is incorrect.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the provided spectroscopic data, the only chemical formula that fits all the evidence is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<B>>>"
