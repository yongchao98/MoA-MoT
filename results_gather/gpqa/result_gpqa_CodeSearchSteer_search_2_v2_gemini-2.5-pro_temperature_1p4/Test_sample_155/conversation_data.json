    "Here is a breakdown of the chemical reactions and the resulting analysis:\n\n### **Reaction Analysis**\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** (E)-oct-4-ene, a trans-alkene, is treated with mCPBA, which results in a syn-addition of an oxygen atom to form an epoxide. This specific reaction with a trans-alkene produces a trans-epoxide as a racemic mixture of (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers. The subsequent acid-catalyzed ring-opening by water is an anti-addition. The overall transformation is an anti-dihydroxylation of the initial alkene. Anti-addition to a trans-alkene yields a single meso compound, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n*   **Reaction 2:** (Z)-oct-4-ene, a cis-alkene, also undergoes syn-addition with mCPBA. This reaction produces a single, achiral meso-epoxide, (4R,5S)-epoxyoctane. The subsequent acid-catalyzed anti-addition of water opens the epoxide ring. Anti-addition to a cis-alkene results in a racemic mixture of (4R,4R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol enantiomers.\n\n### **Product Mixture**\n\nAfter combining the products from both reactions, the final mixture contains three distinct chemical compounds:\n1.  A meso compound: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n2.  A pair of enantiomers: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Chromatographic Analysis**\n\n*   **Standard (Achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:** This technique separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. Enantiomers possess identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated, eluting together as a single peak. However, diastereomers (like the meso compound and the enantiomeric pair) have different physical properties and can be separated. Thus, the chromatogram will show two peaks: one for the meso compound and another for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This method utilizes a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers. The two enantiomers will interact differently with the chiral column, resulting in different retention times and two separate peaks. The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the enantiomers, will also have a distinct interaction with the chiral stationary phase and will elute as a third, separate peak. Therefore, the chiral chromatogram will display three peaks.\n\nBased on this analysis, the chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<B>>>"
