    "To find the kinetic energy (KE) of the product particles in the decay of a stationary pion (π⁺), we apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\nThe decay process is: π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν\n\nGiven:\n*   The pion (π⁺) is stationary, meaning its initial momentum is zero.\n*   Rest mass of π⁺ (m_π) = 139.6 MeV/c²\n*   Rest mass of μ⁺ (m_μ) = 105.7 MeV/c²\n*   The neutrino (ν) is considered to have a negligible or zero rest mass.\n\n**1. Conservation of Energy:**\nSince the pion is at rest, its total initial energy is its rest mass energy. This energy is converted into the total energies of the muon (μ⁺) and the neutrino (ν).\n\nE_π = E_μ + E_ν\nm_πc² = (KE_μ + m_μc²) + E_ν\n\n**2. Conservation of Momentum:**\nThe initial momentum is zero because the pion is stationary. Therefore, the final momentum of the system must also be zero. This means the muon and neutrino must travel in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude.\n\np_μ = p_ν = p\n\n**3. Calculation:**\nThe total energy of the massless neutrino is equal to its momentum multiplied by the speed of light (E_ν = pc). This is also equal to its kinetic energy (KE_ν).\n\nThe energy and momentum of the particles are related by the equation: E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)²\n\nWe can solve for the momentum (pc) first:\npc = [(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²] / [2 * m_πc²]\npc = [(139.6)² - (105.7)²] / [2 * 139.6]\npc = [19488.16 - 11172.49] / 279.2\npc = 8315.67 / 279.2\npc ≈ 29.8 MeV\n\n**Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino (KE_ν):**\nFor the massless neutrino, its kinetic energy is equal to its total energy, E_ν = pc.\nKE_ν ≈ 29.8 MeV.\n\n**Kinetic Energy of the Muon (KE_μ):**\nThe total energy of the muon (E_μ) can be found from energy conservation:\nE_μ = m_πc² - E_ν\nE_μ = 139.6 MeV - 29.8 MeV\nE_μ = 109.8 MeV\n\nThe kinetic energy of the muon is its total energy minus its rest mass energy.\nKE_μ = E_μ - m_μc²\nKE_μ = 109.8 MeV - 105.7 MeV\nKE_μ = 4.1 MeV\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.1 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. This matches one of the provided options.\n\n<<<B>>>"
