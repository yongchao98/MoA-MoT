    "To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], in the solution, we need to calculate the mole fraction of this species relative to all cobalt-containing species. The formation of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes is governed by the following equilibria and their overall stability constants (β):\n\n*   Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺,       β₁ = 9\n*   Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂],     β₂ = 40\n*   Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻,    β₃ = 63\n*   Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻,   β₄ = 16\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of the free Co²⁺ ion and all its complexes:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\nThe mole fraction (αₙ) of a specific complex, [Co(SCN)ₙ]²⁻ⁿ, is given by the formula:\nαₙ = (βₙ[SCN⁻]ⁿ) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nWe are asked to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, which corresponds to α₂.\n\nGiven:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, we calculate the denominator of the mole fraction equation:\nDenominator = 1 + (9 × 0.1) + (40 × 0.1²) + (63 × 0.1³) + (16 × 0.1⁴)\nDenominator = 1 + (9 × 0.1) + (40 × 0.01) + (63 × 0.001) + (16 × 0.0001)\nDenominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016\nDenominator = 2.3646\n\nNext, we calculate the numerator for α₂:\nNumerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = 0.4\n\nNow, we can calculate the mole fraction α₂:\nα₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\nPercentage of [Co(SCN)₂] = 0.16916 × 100 ≈ 16.9%\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<D>>>"
