    "Based on the principles of electrochemistry:\n\n*   **Thermodynamics:** The strength of an oxidizing agent is determined by its standard reduction potential (E°). A more positive E° indicates a stronger oxidant.\n    *   In an acidic solution, the reduction of oxygen is: O₂ + 4H⁺ + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O, with E° = +1.23 V.\n    *   In a basic solution, the reduction of oxygen is: O₂ + 2H₂O + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻, with E° = +0.40 V.\n    *   Since the reduction potential in basic solution (+0.40 V) is less positive than in acidic solution (+1.23 V), oxygen is thermodynamically a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions.\n\n*   **Kinetics:** The rate of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is known to be generally sluggish. In acidic solutions, the large overpotential required for the reaction indicates slow kinetics. Studies have shown that the reaction rate can be slower in acidic media compared to alkaline (basic) media. One reason for this is that the presence and adsorption of certain anions in acidic solutions can hinder the reaction. Therefore, kinetically, oxygen reacts **slower** in acidic solutions.\n\nThe correct combination is **weaker** and **slower**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
