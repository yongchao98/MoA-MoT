    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Physics\nThe problem involves the decay of relativistic particles. Key concepts include:\n*   **Particle Decay:** The number of particles `N` remaining after a time `t` follows the exponential decay law: `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / T)`, where `N₀` is the initial number of particles and `T` is the mean lifetime of the particles *in the frame of reference where time is measured*.\n*   **Time Dilation:** A particle moving with a Lorentz factor `γ` has a lifetime in the laboratory frame (`T_lab`) that is dilated compared to its proper lifetime `τ` (its lifetime in its own rest frame). The relation is `T_lab = γ * τ`.\n*   **Relativistic Travel:** The particles travel at \"ultra-relativistic velocities,\" meaning their speed `v` is very close to the speed of light `c`. The time it takes for them to reach the detector wall of radius `R` in the lab frame is `t_flight = R / v ≈ R / c`.\n\n### 2. Formulate the Equation for the First Scenario\nIn the lab frame, the fraction of particles (`f`) that reach the detector is given by the decay law, where the time is the flight time to the wall (`t_flight`) and the lifetime is the dilated lab-frame lifetime (`T_lab`).\n\n*   Fraction `f = N(t_flight) / N₀ = exp(-t_flight / T_lab)`\n*   Substituting the expressions for `t_flight` and `T_lab`: `f = exp(-(R/c) / (γτ))`\n\nWe are given the following for the first scenario:\n*   Detector Radius, `R = 30 m`\n*   Fraction of particles reaching the detector, `f₁ = 1/3`\n*   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`\n\nPlugging these values into the equation:\n`1/3 = exp(-(30/c) / (20 * τ))`\n\nTo solve for the unknown proper lifetime `τ` (or more conveniently, the term `c*τ`), we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(1/3) = -(30/c) / (20 * τ)`\n`-ln(3) = -30 / (20 * c * τ)`\n`ln(3) = 1.5 / (c * τ)`\n\nThis equation relates the known quantities from the first scenario to the particle's physical properties.\n\n### 3. Formulate the Equation for the Second Scenario\nNow, we want to find the new Lorentz factor (`γ₂`) required for a different fraction of particles to reach the wall.\n\n*   Desired fraction, `f₂ = 2/3`\n*   Unknown Lorentz factor, `γ₂`\n\nThe equation for this second scenario is:\n`2/3 = exp(-(30/c) / (γ₂ * τ))`\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(2/3) = -(30/c) / (γ₂ * τ)`\n`-ln(3/2) = -30 / (γ₂ * c * τ)`\n`ln(3/2) = 30 / (γ₂ * c * τ)`\n\n### 4. Solve for the New Lorentz Factor (γ₂)\nWe now have a system of two equations:\n1.  `ln(3) = 1.5 / (c * τ)`\n2.  `ln(3/2) = 30 / (γ₂ * c * τ)`\n\nFrom equation (1), we can express the term `c * τ`:\n`c * τ = 1.5 / ln(3)`\n\nNow, substitute this expression for `c * τ` into equation (2):\n`ln(3/2) = 30 / (γ₂ * (1.5 / ln(3)))`\n`ln(3/2) = (30 * ln(3)) / (1.5 * γ₂)`\n\nNow, we solve for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = (30 * ln(3)) / (1.5 * ln(3/2))`\n`γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(1.5)`\n\n### 5. Calculate the Final Value\nUsing the approximate values for the natural logarithms:\n*   `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986`\n*   `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`\n\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986) / 0.4055`\n`γ₂ ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055`\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\nThis value is very close to 54. A similar problem found in a search also yielded the answer 54.\n\nThe Lorentz factor needed is approximately 54.\n\n<<<B>>>"
