    "To find the numerical value of \"a\", we must use the normalization condition from quantum mechanics. This principle states that the total probability of finding the particle somewhere in the space it can exist must be equal to 1.\n\nThe probability of finding the particle in a specific region is given by the integral of the square of the modulus of the wave function over that region. The square of the modulus, |ψ(x)|², is also known as the probability density.\n\nGiven the wave function ψ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5i, we first need to calculate its squared modulus, |ψ(x)|². For a complex number of the form z = Re + iIm, the squared modulus is Re² + Im².\n\nIn our case:\n*   The real part is Re(x) = a / sqrt(1 + x)\n*   The imaginary part is Im(x) = -0.5\n\nSo, the probability density is:\n|ψ(x)|² = [a / sqrt(1 + x)]² + (-0.5)²\n|ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\nThe problem states that the particles were only found between x=1 and x=3. Therefore, the integral of the probability density from 1 to 3 must be equal to 1:\n∫[from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1\n\nWe can split this into two separate integrals:\na² ∫[from 1 to 3] (1 / (1 + x)) dx + ∫[from 1 to 3] 0.25 dx = 1\n\nNow, we evaluate each integral:\n1.  The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x).\n    *   Evaluating from 1 to 3: ln(1+3) - ln(1+1) = ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).\n2.  The integral of 0.25 is 0.25x.\n    *   Evaluating from 1 to 3: 0.25(3) - 0.25(1) = 0.75 - 0.25 = 0.5.\n\nSubstituting these results back into the equation:\na² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\n\nNow, we solve for \"a\":\na² * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5\na² * ln(2) = 0.5\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n\nUsing the approximate value of ln(2) ≈ 0.693:\na² ≈ 0.5 / 0.693\na² ≈ 0.7215\na ≈ sqrt(0.7215)\na ≈ 0.8494\n\nThis value is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
