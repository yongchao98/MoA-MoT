    "To find the energy spectrum of the quantum mechanical particle, we first need to analyze the potential V(r, θ) and express it in a more convenient coordinate system. The Schrödinger equation is often easier to solve in Cartesian coordinates (x, y) if the potential separates into functions of x and y.\n\nThe given potential is:\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 kr² + 3/2 kr² cos²(θ)\n\nWe use the standard transformations from polar to Cartesian coordinates:\nx = r cos(θ)\ny = r sin(θ)\nr² = x² + y²\n\nSubstitute these into the potential expression:\nV(x, y) = 1/2 k(x² + y²) + 3/2 k(r cos(θ))²\nV(x, y) = 1/2 k(x² + y²) + 3/2 kx²\n\nNow, we can combine the terms:\nV(x, y) = 1/2 kx² + 1/2 ky² + 3/2 kx²\nV(x, y) = (1/2 k + 3/2 k)x² + 1/2 ky²\nV(x, y) = (4/2 k)x² + 1/2 ky²\nV(x, y) = 2kx² + 1/2 ky²\n\nThis potential is a sum of two independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillator potentials, one in the x-direction, V_x(x), and one in the y-direction, V_y(y):\nV(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)\nwhere:\nV_x(x) = 2kx² = 1/2 (4k)x²\nV_y(y) = 1/2 ky²\n\nThe energy spectrum for a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator with a potential of the form V(q) = 1/2 mω²q² is given by E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω. The angular frequency ω is related to the \"spring constant\" k' by ω = sqrt(k'/m).\n\nFor the x-direction, the effective spring constant is k_x = 4k. The angular frequency is:\nω_x = sqrt(4k / m) = 2 * sqrt(k / m)\n\nFor the y-direction, the spring constant is k_y = k. The angular frequency is:\nω_y = sqrt(k / m)\n\nSince the potential is separable, the total energy E is the sum of the energies from the two independent oscillators:\nE = E_x + E_y\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for each oscillator are:\nE_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * (2 * sqrt(k / m))\nE_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k / m)\nwhere n_x and n_y are non-negative integers (0, 1, 2, ...).\n\nNow, we sum the energies:\nE = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * 2 * sqrt(k / m) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n\nFactor out the common term ħ * sqrt(k / m):\nE = [ (n_x + 1/2) * 2 + (n_y + 1/2) ] * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\nE = [ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 ] * ħ * sqrt(k / m)\nE = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ħ * sqrt(k / m)\n\nComparing this result with the given options, we find that it matches option A.\n\nA) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\nB) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nC) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nD) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n\n<<<A>>>"
