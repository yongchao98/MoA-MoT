    "### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1.  **IR Spectrum Interpretation:** The broad absorption between 3400-2500 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid. The peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, which falls within the typical range for a carboxylic acid. The absorptions at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ are indicative of C=C stretching within an aromatic ring. Together, these data strongly suggest that Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Interpretation:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This highly deshielded, broad singlet is a classic signal for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a tell-tale sign of a para (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is likely due to the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the doublet at 7.2 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the other substituent.\n    *   **Alkyl Chain Analysis:**\n        *   The signal at **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)** is a triplet, indicating a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n        *   The signal at **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)** is a multiplet for a methylene group. It is likely adjacent to the methyl group at 0.9 ppm and a methine group (-CH-).\n        *   The signal at **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)** is a doublet, indicating a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a single proton (a -CH- group).\n        *   The signal at **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)** is a multiplet for a single proton, likely the benzylic methine (-CH-) group, which is attached to the benzene ring. It is coupled to the adjacent methyl and methylene groups.\n    *   **Assembling the Substituent:** Piecing these fragments together [-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)] gives a *sec*-butyl group. This group is attached to the para position relative to the carboxylic acid.\n\n3.  **Identification of Compound X:** Based on the spectral analysis, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches option (C).\n\n4.  **Reaction Analysis:** The reaction is carried out with red phosphorus (P) and hydriodic acid (HI). This combination is a powerful reducing agent. When a carboxylic acid is treated with red P and HI, the carboxyl group (-COOH) is completely reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃). This reaction is a thorough reduction that converts the carboxylic acid functionality directly to an alkane.\n\n5.  **Predicting the Final Product:** The starting material, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, will undergo reduction of its carboxylic acid group to a methyl group. The *sec*-butyl group and the aromatic ring will remain unchanged under these conditions.\n\n    Therefore, the final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Comparing the predicted product with the given options, the correct answer is (A).\n\n<<<A>>>"
