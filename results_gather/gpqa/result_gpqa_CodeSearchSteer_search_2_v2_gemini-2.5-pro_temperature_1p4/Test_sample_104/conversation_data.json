    "The problem involves calculating a hypothetical exoplanet's size based on the light variation from a spotted star. Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n### 1. Amplitude of Brightness Variation from the Spotted Star\n\nFirst, we determine the amplitude of the brightness change caused by the star's rotation. The variation is due to the contrast between the unspotted hemisphere and the hemisphere partially covered by cooler, dark spots. The flux (brightness) of a radiating surface is described by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature (T⁴).\n\nThe maximum brightness (F_max) occurs when the completely unspotted hemisphere faces the observer. This is proportional to the star's effective temperature (T_eff).\n`F_max ∝ T_eff⁴`\n\nThe minimum brightness (F_min) occurs when the spotted hemisphere is in view. This hemisphere has 20% of its area covered by spots (filling factor, f = 0.20) which are 1000K cooler than the rest of the star.\n\n*   Effective temperature of the star, T_eff = 6000 K\n*   Temperature of the spots, T_spot = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n*   Filling factor of spots, f = 0.20\n\nThe flux from the spotted hemisphere is a combination of the flux from the normal part (80% of the area) and the spotted part (20% of the area).\n`F_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴`\n\nThe amplitude of the light curve variation is the relative difference between the maximum and minimum flux:\n`Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max`\n`Amplitude = (T_eff⁴ - [(1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴]) / T_eff⁴`\n`Amplitude = f * (T_eff⁴ - T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴`\n`Amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)`\n\nPlugging in the values:\n`Amplitude = 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴)`\n`Amplitude = 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)⁴)`\n`Amplitude = 0.20 * (1 - 625/1296)`\n`Amplitude = 0.20 * (671 / 1296) ≈ 0.20 * 0.5177 ≈ 0.1035`\n\nSo, the rotational modulation causes a brightness variation of approximately 10.35%.\n\n### 2. Brightness Drop from a Transiting Exoplanet\n\nNext, we consider the signal from a transiting exoplanet. The drop in a star's brightness during a transit is known as the transit depth. This is the ratio of the planet's disk area to the star's disk area.\n`Transit Depth = (Area_planet) / (Area_star)`\n`Transit Depth = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²`\n\nWhere `R_pl` is the planet's radius and `R_star` is the star's radius.\n\n### 3. Equating the Signals\n\nThe problem requires us to find the planet-to-star radius ratio (`R_pl / R_star`) that would produce the same amplitude signal as the spotted star. We set the transit depth equal to the calculated amplitude of the starspot variation.\n\n`(R_pl / R_star)² = Amplitude`\n`(R_pl / R_star)² ≈ 0.1035`\n\nNow, we solve for the relative radius `R_pl / R_star`:\n`R_pl / R_star = √0.1035 ≈ 0.3217`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~0.32\nB) ~0.07\nC) ~0.39\nD) ~0.11\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
