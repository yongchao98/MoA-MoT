    "To clearly distinguish between two energy levels, the difference in their energies (ΔE_diff = E2 - E1) must be greater than the sum of the energy uncertainties (linewidths) of each state. This is based on the energy-time uncertainty principle.\n\nThe energy-time uncertainty principle is given by the formula ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2, where ΔE is the energy uncertainty, Δt is the lifetime of the state, and ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h/2π).\n\nFirst, we calculate the energy uncertainty for each state. The value of the reduced Planck constant (ħ) is approximately 6.582 x 10^-16 eV·s.\n\nFor the first state (τ1 = 10^-9 s):\nΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1\nΔE1 ≈ (6.582 x 10^-16 eV·s) / (10^-9 s)\nΔE1 ≈ 6.582 x 10^-7 eV\n\nFor the second state (τ2 = 10^-8 s):\nΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2\nΔE2 ≈ (6.582 x 10^-16 eV·s) / (10^-8 s)\nΔE2 ≈ 6.582 x 10^-8 eV\n\nThe total energy uncertainty, which represents the minimum energy difference required to resolve the two levels, is the sum of the individual uncertainties:\nΔE_total = ΔE1 + ΔE2\nΔE_total ≈ 6.582 x 10^-7 eV + 6.582 x 10^-8 eV\nΔE_total ≈ 7.24 x 10^-7 eV\n\nFor the energy levels to be clearly resolved, the energy difference between them must be significantly larger than this total uncertainty. Let's examine the given options:\n\nA) 10^-4 eV: This value is much larger than the calculated total uncertainty of approximately 7.24 x 10^-7 eV.\nB) 10^-11 eV: This is much smaller than the uncertainty of either state.\nC) 10^-8 eV: This is smaller than the uncertainty of the first state (ΔE1).\nD) 10^-9 eV: This is much smaller than the uncertainty of either state.\n\nTherefore, an energy difference of 10^-4 eV is the only option that is sufficiently large to ensure that the two energy levels can be clearly distinguished.\n\n<<<A>>>"
