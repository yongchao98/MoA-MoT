    "To determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the final product, we must first understand the starting material and the nature of the chemical reaction.\n\n### 1. The Reactant and its Structure\n\nThe starting compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's break down its structure to find its molecular formula:\n*   **Cyclohex-3-ene:** A six-membered carbon ring with one double bond.\n*   **Carboxylic acid (-COOH):** This group contains one carbon, two oxygens, and one hydrogen. Let's assume it is at position 1 of the ring.\n*   **Formyl group (-CHO):** An aldehyde group containing one carbon, one oxygen, and one hydrogen, located at position 2.\n*   **Vinyl group (-CH=CH₂):** An alkene group with two carbons and three hydrogens, located at position 5.\n\nBased on this structure, the molecular formula is **C₁₀H₁₂O₃**.\n\nWe can calculate the IHD of the reactant to verify the structure. The formula for IHD is:\nIHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 11 - 6 = 5\n\nThis IHD of 5 corresponds to:\n*   1 for the ring structure.\n*   1 for the double bond within the ring (cyclohex-3-ene).\n*   1 for the double bond in the vinyl group.\n*   1 for the carbonyl double bond (C=O) in the formyl group.\n*   1 for the carbonyl double bond (C=O) in the carboxylic acid group.\n\n### 2. The Reaction\n\nThe reagent used is red phosphorus (Red P) with an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination is a very strong reducing agent. It is known to reduce various functional groups completely to alkanes:\n*   **Aldehydes and Ketones:** The carbonyl group (C=O) is reduced to a methylene group (-CH₂-), and a terminal aldehyde like the formyl group (-CHO) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   **Carboxylic Acids:** The carboxyl group (-COOH) is completely reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   **Alkenes and Alkynes:** Carbon-carbon double and triple bonds are reduced to single bonds.\n*   **Alcohols:** The hydroxyl group (-OH) is replaced by a hydrogen atom.\n\nThe role of red phosphorus is to regenerate HI from the iodine (I₂) that is formed during the reaction, thus allowing the reaction to go to completion.\n\n### 3. The Product\n\nGiven the potent reducing power of Red P + HI, all the functional groups and unsaturations in the reactant molecule will be reduced:\n*   The **carboxylic acid** at position 1 becomes a **methyl group**.\n*   The **formyl group** at position 2 becomes a **methyl group**.\n*   The **double bond in the cyclohexene ring** is saturated, forming a **cyclohexane ring**.\n*   The **vinyl group** at position 5 is reduced to an **ethyl group** (-CH₂CH₃).\n\nTherefore, the final product is **1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane**.\n\n### 4. Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product\n\nNow, let's determine the molecular formula of the product, 1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane:\n*   **Carbon atoms:** 6 in the ring + 1 from the first methyl + 1 from the second methyl + 2 from the ethyl group = 10 carbon atoms (C₁₀).\n*   **Hydrogen atoms:** A saturated acyclic alkane with 10 carbons would have the formula C₁₀H₂₂. A cycloalkane with one ring has the general formula CₙH₂ₙ. Thus, for 10 carbons, the formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n\nThe molecular formula of the product is **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency for the product is calculated as:\nIHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 11 - 10 = 1\n\nThis single degree of unsaturation is accounted for by the presence of the cyclohexane ring. Since there are no double or triple bonds in the final product, the IHD is 1.\n\n<<<A>>>"
