    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the flux ratio.\n\n1.  **Understand the Initial State:** Before any changes, the solar neutrino flux in the 700-900 keV energy range is composed of several sources:\n    *   **pp-II Branch:** This produces a very strong, discrete energy line of neutrinos at 861 keV from the electron capture of Beryllium-7 (`⁷Be`).\n    *   **pp-III Branch:** This produces a continuous spectrum of neutrinos from the beta decay of Boron-8 (`⁸B`). This spectrum extends to high energies (~15 MeV) and contributes some flux across both the 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV bands.\n    *   **CNO Cycle:** This produces a continuous spectrum of neutrinos, primarily from the decay of Nitrogen-13 (`¹³N`) and Oxygen-15 (`¹⁵O`), which also contribute across both bands.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Hypothetical Change:** The problem states that the **pp-III branch suddenly stops**.\n    *   This means the production of `⁸B` neutrinos ceases.\n    *   The `⁸B` neutrino flux drops to zero across all energy bands.\n    *   The pp-II branch (producing `⁷Be` neutrinos) and the CNO cycle reactions continue as they were.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Flux in Each Band *After* the Change:**\n    *   **Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV):** With the `⁸B` neutrinos gone, the only remaining source of neutrinos in this energy band is the continuous spectrum from the CNO cycle.\n    *   **Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV):** This band contains two remaining sources: the extremely high-flux `⁷Be` neutrino line at 861 keV and the continuous spectrum from the CNO cycle.\n\n4.  **Interpret the Question and Calculate the Ratio:** A direct calculation of the total flux ratio would involve comparing the CNO flux in Band 1 to the sum of the `⁷Be` line flux and the CNO flux in Band 2. The `⁷Be` line has a total flux that is thousands of times greater than the integrated continuum flux from the CNO cycle in a 100 keV band. This literal calculation would yield a ratio of approximately 10⁻⁴, which is not among the options.\n\n    This discrepancy suggests that the question is intended to compare the *underlying continuum fluxes* in the two bands, treating the singular, discrete `⁷Be` line as a separate feature not to be included in the flux integration \"between two bands\". Following this interpretation:\n    *   The continuum flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV) is from the CNO cycle.\n    *   The continuum flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV) is also from the CNO cycle.\n\n    The energy spectra from the CNO cycle are relatively flat and slowly decreasing in the region between 700 keV and 900 keV. Therefore, the total continuous flux integrated over the 100 keV width of Band 1 is approximately the same as the flux integrated over the 100 keV width of Band 2.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The ratio of the flux in Band 1 to the flux in Band 2, when considering only the remaining continuous spectra, is approximately 1.\n\n    Flux (band 1) / Flux (band 2) ≈ 1\n\n<<<C>>>"
