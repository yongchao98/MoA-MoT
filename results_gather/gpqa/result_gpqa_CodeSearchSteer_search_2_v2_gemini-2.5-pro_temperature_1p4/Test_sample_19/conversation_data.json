    "The \"impulse approximation\" in many-body nuclear physics is based on a set of simplifying assumptions about how a projectile interacts with a nucleon inside a nucleus. Analyzing the core principles of this approximation reveals the correct combination of statements.\n\nThe essential ideas of the impulse approximation are:\n*   **Single Nucleon Interaction**: The incoming particle or interaction current is assumed to engage with only one nucleon at a time. The rest of the (A-1) nucleons in the nucleus are considered \"spectators.\" This directly corresponds to assumption 1.\n*   **Negligible Binding Forces**: The interaction happens so quickly that during the collision, the nucleon that is struck behaves as if it were a free particle, unaffected by the binding forces of the nucleus. This is the essence of assumption 4. This is often valid for interactions at high momentum transfer.\n*   **No Final-State Interactions**: After the interaction, the struck nucleon and/or the projectile are assumed to exit the nucleus without further interactions with the remaining nucleons. This implies that the rest of the nucleus is effectively transparent to the outgoing particles, which supports assumption 2.\n\nAssumption 3, concerning the non-relativistic nature of the quarks *within* the nucleon, deals with the internal structure of the nucleon itself. This is a separate physical consideration from the impulse approximation, which is designed to simplify the many-body problem of the nucleus as a whole. While a Relativistic Impulse Approximation (RIA) exists, it treats the *nucleon's* motion relativistically, not necessarily the quarks inside it. Therefore, assumption 3 is not a core component of the impulse approximation itself.\n\nBased on this, the three assumptions that jointly define the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
