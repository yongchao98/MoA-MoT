    "The analysis of the search results confirms the initial reasoning.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the key physical principles and formulas gathered from the search, confirming the steps taken:\n\n1.  **Radial Velocity (RV) and Doppler Shift**: The RV method detects exoplanets by measuring the periodic Doppler shift in the host star's spectrum. The star \"wobbles\" due to the gravitational pull of the orbiting planet. This wobble causes its light to be blueshifted when moving towards Earth and redshifted when moving away.\n\n2.  **Wavelength Shift and Radial Velocity Amplitude (K)**: The observed wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r) along the line of sight, as given by the Doppler formula: v_r = (Δλ / λ) * c. The maximum velocity measured is the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity curve, denoted as K. Therefore, the maximum wavelength shift (Δλ_max) is directly proportional to K.\n\n3.  **The Formula for K**: The semi-amplitude K is related to the orbital period (P), the planet's mass (M_p), the star's mass (M_*), the orbital eccentricity (e), and the inclination of the orbit (i). The formula is:\n    K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (M_p * sin(i)) / (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²)).\n\n4.  **Simplifying the Formula**: The problem states that the orbits are circular, which means the eccentricity (e) is 0. This simplifies the term `1 / sqrt(1 - e²)` to 1. Also, since the planets are Neptune-mass and the stars are Sun-mass, the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star's mass (M_p << M_*), so (M_* + M_p) ≈ M_*. The formula simplifies to:\n    K ≈ (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (M_p * sin(i)) / (M_*)^(2/3).\n\n5.  **Deriving the Period Relationship**: To find the relationship between the period (P) and the semi-amplitude (K), we can rearrange the simplified formula:\n    *   K ∝ P^(-1/3) * M_p * M_*^(-2/3)\n    *   P^(-1/3) ∝ K * M_*^(2/3) / M_p\n    *   P ∝ (K * M_*^(2/3) / M_p)^(-3)\n    *   P ∝ K⁻³ * M_*⁻² * M_p³\n\n6.  **Calculating the Ratio of the Periods (P₂ / P₁)**: We are asked to find P₂ / P₁. Using the proportionality from the previous step:\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = (K₂⁻³ * M_*2⁻² * M_p2³) / (K₁⁻³ * M_*1⁻² * M_p1³)\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = (K₁/K₂)³ * (M_*1/M_*2)² * (M_p2/M_p1)³\n\n7.  **Applying the Problem's Conditions**:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: M_*1 = M_*2, so (M_*1/M_*2)² = 1.\n    *   The planets have similar masses: M_p1 ≈ M_p2, so (M_p2/M_p1)³ ≈ 1.\n    *   The problem does not mention the orbital inclination `i`. In such problems, it's a standard assumption that either the orbits are edge-on (sin(i)=1) or the sin(i) factor is comparable for both systems and cancels out in the ratio. The value `M_p` in the formula is technically `M_p * sin(i)`, the minimum mass, which is what is directly measured. We assume the \"similar masses\" refers to this directly measured property.\n    *   The ratio of the semi-amplitudes (K₁/K₂) is equal to the ratio of their observed wavelength shifts (Δλ₁/Δλ₂), since K ∝ Δλ.\n    *   K₁ / K₂ = 5 mÅ / 7 mÅ = 5/7.\n\n8.  **Final Calculation**: Substituting the values into the simplified ratio:\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = (K₁/K₂)³ = (5/7)³\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis result corresponds to option D. The logic holds and is confirmed by the physics of the radial velocity method found in the search results.\n\n<<<D>>>"
