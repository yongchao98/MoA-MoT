Deconstruct the Question\n*   **Goal:** Synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Starting Material:** Benzene.\n*   **Constraint:** The synthesis should be \"high-yield\". This is a key, but potentially misleading, piece of information.\n*   **Task:** Evaluate the four provided reaction sequences (A, B, C, D) and select the most viable one.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Target Molecule\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent (vicinal) substituents.\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt)\n    *   Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu)\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO₂)\n*   **Key Synthetic Challenges:**\n    *   The 1,2,3-substitution pattern is sterically crowded.\n    *   The tert-butyl group is very bulky, which sterically hinders substitution at the adjacent (ortho) positions. Standard nitration of tert-butylbenzene heavily favors the para product.\n    *   The final arrangement has an activating group (-OEt) meta to a deactivating group (-NO₂).\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option for Chemical Feasibility\n\nA valid synthetic sequence must consist of chemically possible reactions in a logical order. A single impossible step invalidates the entire option.\n\n*   **Option C: `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`**\n    *   This sequence starts by forming aniline (steps i and ii).\n    *   Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. **This reaction is impossible.** The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option C is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`**\n    *   This sequence forms a diazonium salt in step (v).\n    *   Step (vi) then attempts to nitrate this highly unstable diazonium salt intermediate. **This is not a standard or viable synthetic reaction.** Diazonium salts are used for replacement reactions, not as substrates for further electrophilic substitution.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B: `... iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ; ... viii) Fe/HCl ...`**\n    *   This sequence is written in a chemically illogical order.\n    *   Step (iv) attempts to perform a diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`), which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂). However, the amine is not formed until a much later step (viii, `Fe/HCl`). A reaction cannot be performed on a functional group that does not yet exist.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option B is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option A: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ...`**\n    *   Since options B, C, and D are chemically impossible, this is the only remaining possibility. Let's analyze its pathway:\n    1.  **i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`**: Benzene → **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid Friedel-Crafts alkylation).\n    2.  **ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`**: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of ortho- and para-isomers. To reach the target, we must proceed with the minor **ortho-isomer (1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene)**. This step is chemically possible, but it is not high-yield.\n    3.  **iii) `Fe/HCl`**: Reduction of the nitro group → **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid).\n    4.  **iv) `HNO3/H2SO4`**: Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a meta-director. The tert-butyl group is an ortho, para-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 3, forming **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. (This is a valid and key step).\n    5.  **v) `NaNO2/HCl`**: Diazotization of the amino group to form a diazonium salt. (Valid).\n    6.  **vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`**: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol → **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. (Valid).\n    7.  **vii) `NaOH/EtBr`**: Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Valid).\n    8.  The final steps (viii, ix) are superfluous but do not invalidate the core synthesis.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nOptions B, C, and D contain chemically impossible or nonsensically ordered steps, rendering them invalid. Option A is the only sequence that describes a chemically plausible pathway from start to finish that produces the correctly named target molecule. Although the \"high-yield\" claim in the question is contradicted by the poor regioselectivity of the initial nitration step, Option A is the only viable choice among the given options.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n### 1. Deconstruction of the Target Molecule and Synthetic Goals\n*   **Target Molecule**: 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Structure**: The molecule has three adjacent (vicinal) substituents on a benzene ring: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at C1, a bulky tert-butyl group (-tBu) at C2, and a nitro group (-NO₂) at C3.\n*   **Key Constraint**: The question specifies a \"high-yield\" synthesis. This is a critical factor in evaluating the proposed pathways.\n*   **Synthetic Challenges**:\n    *   The 1,2,3-substitution pattern is sterically crowded and electronically complex to achieve.\n    *   Introducing a substituent *ortho* to the very bulky tert-butyl group is difficult via standard electrophilic aromatic substitution, which strongly favors the *para* position.\n    *   The final arrangement has an activating group (-OEt) meta to a deactivating group (-NO₂).\n\n### 2. Analysis of the Final Synthetic Steps (Retrosynthesis)\nA common and effective way to form an aryl ether (the ethoxy group) is the Williamson ether synthesis. This involves reacting the corresponding phenol with a base and an ethyl halide.\n*   **Final Step**: The reaction would be `2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol + NaOH/EtBr → 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene`. This matches step `vii) NaOH/EtBr` found in the options.\n*   **Precursor to the Phenol**: A standard method to create a phenol is through the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine, followed by hydrolysis. This means the key intermediate before the final two steps is **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n*   **Core Problem**: The central challenge is to synthesize **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline** from benzene.\n\n### 3. Systematic Evaluation of Each Option\n\nWe will now evaluate each option for chemical feasibility. A single impossible step invalidates the entire sequence.\n\n*   **Option A**: `...v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    This sequence attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt (formed in step v). Diazonium salts are highly unstable intermediates used for replacement reactions, not as substrates for nitration. They would decompose under these conditions.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Option A is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option C**: `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    This sequence starts by forming aniline (steps i and ii). Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) complexes with the basic amino group, strongly deactivating the ring and preventing alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Option C is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option D**: `...iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    This sequence is written in an illogical order. Step (iv) is a diazotization reaction (`NaNO₂/HCl`), which requires a primary aromatic amine. However, at this point in the sequence, no amine has been formed.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Option D is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option B**: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    This is the only remaining option. Let's analyze its chemical logic step-by-step:\n    1.  **i) Friedel-Crafts Alkylation**: Benzene is converted to **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n    2.  **ii) Nitration**: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene gives a mixture of ortho and para isomers. To reach the target molecule, the **ortho isomer (1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene)** must be used. This is the minor product due to steric hindrance from the t-butyl group, which conflicts with the \"high-yield\" requirement. However, the reaction is chemically possible.\n    3.  **iii) Reduction**: The nitro group is reduced to an amine, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n    4.  **iv) Nitration**: This is a key step. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a meta-director. The t-butyl group is an ortho, para-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 3, forming the required **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. (Valid)\n    5.  **v) Diazotization**: The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt. (Valid)\n    6.  **vi) Hydrolysis**: The diazonium salt is heated in aqueous acid to form a phenol, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. (Valid)\n    7.  **vii) Williamson Ether Synthesis**: The phenol is converted to the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Valid)\n    8.  The final steps (viii and ix) are superfluous but do not invalidate the core synthesis.\n\n### Final Decision\nOptions A, C, and D contain fundamentally impossible chemical steps and must be eliminated. Option B describes a sequence of reactions that is chemically plausible and is the only one that can lead to the named target molecule. While the low yield of the initial nitration step contradicts the \"high-yield\" condition in the prompt, this is likely a flaw in the question's wording. In a multiple-choice format, the only chemically possible route to the correct product is the intended answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to systematically evaluate each of the four proposed reaction sequences. For each option, I will analyze the chemical transformations step-by-step, considering reaction feasibility, regioselectivity (directing effects of substituents), and steric hindrance. The goal is to identify the single sequence that is chemically plausible and leads to the target molecule, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. I will pay special attention to common pitfalls like attempting reactions on incompatible functional groups (e.g., Friedel-Crafts on aniline) or using reagents in an illogical order. The final decision will be based on eliminating the chemically impossible options to find the only viable pathway, even if it has practical limitations (like low yield).\n\n```python\ndef solve_organic_synthesis():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes four multi-step synthesis options to find the correct pathway to\n    2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Target Molecule: 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n    # This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring.\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the reaction sequences to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene:\")\n\n    # Analysis of Option A\n    print(\"\\n--- Analyzing Option A ---\")\n    print(\"Sequence: i) t-BuCl/AlCl3; ii) SO3/H2SO4; iii) HNO3/H2SO4; iv) Fe/HCl; v) NaNO2/HCl; vi) HNO3/H2SO4...\")\n    print(\"Flaw: Step (vi) attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt formed in step (v).

The other options contain fatal chemical flaws.\n\nFinal Decision: By elimination, Option C is the only viable answer.\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Deconstruction of the Question\n*   **Goal:** Identify the correct reaction sequence for the **high-yield** synthesis of **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Starting Material:** Benzene.\n*   **Target Molecule Analysis:**\n    *   It is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   Substituents: -OEt (ethoxy, strong activator, o,p-director), -tBu (tert-butyl, weak activator, o,p-director, very bulky), -NO₂ (nitro, strong deactivator, m-director).\n    *   The 1,2,3 pattern is sterically crowded.\n*   **Key Constraints:** The sequence must be chemically feasible, and the question specifies \"high-yield\".\n\n### 2. Analysis of Each Option for Chemical Feasibility\n\nThe most crucial step is to check if each proposed sequence contains any chemically impossible reactions.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    *   This sequence fails at step (iv). The reagent `NaNO2/HCl` is used for diazotization, which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) as the starting material. The product after step (iii) is a sulfonic acid, not an amine.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option A is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   This sequence fails at step (iii). It attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline (the product of steps i and ii). Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on aniline because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option C is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    *   This sequence fails at step (vi). It attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt (formed in step v). Diazonium salts are highly unstable intermediates used for replacement reactions (e.g., with H₂O, CuX), not for subsequent electrophilic aromatic substitution like nitration. The harsh nitrating conditions would cause decomposition.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option D is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    *   This is the only sequence that does not contain an immediately obvious impossible step. Let's trace its chemical pathway.\n    1.  **i) Friedel-Crafts Alkylation:** Benzene → **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n    2.  **ii) Nitration:** tert-butylbenzene → mixture of o- and p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. (Valid)\n    3.  **iii) Reduction:** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group. (Valid)\n    4.  **iv) Nitration:** The aniline derivative is nitrated again. (Valid)\n    5.  **v) Diazotization:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt. (Valid)\n    6.  **vi) Hydrolysis:** The diazonium salt is converted to a phenol. (Valid)\n    7.  **vii) Williamson Ether Synthesis:** The phenol is converted to the final ethoxy ether. (Valid)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Every step in this sequence represents a valid chemical transformation.\n\n### 3. Resolving the \"High-Yield\" vs. \"Target Molecule\" Conflict\n\nWhile Option B is the only chemically possible sequence, there is a conflict between the \"high-yield\" requirement and the identity of the final product.\n\n*   **Path to Target Molecule (Low Yield):** To get the named product, one must use the minor *ortho* isomer from step (ii). This violates the \"high-yield\" condition but does lead to the correct structure.\n*   **High-Yield Path (to Isomer):** Following the major *para* isomer from step (ii) leads to a high-yield synthesis of **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**, an isomer of the target.\n\n### 4. Final Decision\n\nIn a multiple-choice question, a sequence with a chemically impossible step is fundamentally incorrect. Options A, C, and D are all invalid for this reason. Option B is the only sequence composed entirely of valid chemical reactions. Therefore, by elimination, it must be the intended answer. The question is flawed because the pathway in Option B cannot be both high-yield *and* lead to the named product, but it is the only viable choice among the options provided.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n*   **Product Name:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2, and a nitro group (-NO₂) at position 3.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted (vicinal) pattern. This arrangement is often challenging to synthesize due to steric hindrance and the need to control the directing effects of multiple substituents.\n*   **Substituent Properties:**\n    *   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** An activating group and an *ortho, para*-director. It is very bulky, which sterically hinders substitution at its *ortho* positions, making *para* substitution heavily favored.\n    *   **-NO₂ (nitro):** A deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n    *   **-OEt (ethoxy):** A strongly activating group and an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **-NH₂ (amino, an intermediate):** A strongly activating group and an *ortho, para*-director. In strong acid, it becomes the **-NH₃⁺ (anilinium) ion**, which is a deactivating *meta*-director.\n\n### 2. Evaluate Each Option for Chemical Feasibility\n\nWe must analyze each sequence as written to identify any chemically impossible or illogical steps. A single fatal flaw invalidates an entire option.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    *   This sequence fails at step (iv). The reagent `NaNO2/HCl` is used for diazotization, a reaction that requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) as the starting material. The product after step (iii) is a sulfonated nitro-tert-butylbenzene, which is not an amine. Therefore, this sequence is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    *   This sequence fails at step (vi). It attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt, which is formed in step (v). Diazonium salts are highly unstable intermediates used for replacement reactions (e.g., Sandmeyer reaction, hydrolysis to phenols). They are not suitable substrates for nitration and would decompose under the harsh conditions. Therefore, this sequence is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) t-BuCl/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   This sequence fails at step (iii). It attempts to perform a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline (the product of steps i and ii). This reaction does not work because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the aromatic ring and prevents alkylation. Therefore, this sequence is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    *   This is the only remaining option. Let's trace the pathway to confirm its validity.\n    1.  **Step i:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene forms **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n    2.  **Step ii:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. To reach the target molecule, we must proceed with the minor *ortho* isomer. While this step is not high-yield, it is chemically possible.\n    3.  **Step iii:** Reduction of the nitro group in 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene yields **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n    4.  **Step iv:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 3, forming **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. (Valid)\n    5.  **Step v:** Diazotization of the amino group forms a diazonium salt. (Valid)\n    6.  **Step vi:** Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt yields **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. (Valid)\n    7.  **Step vii:** Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Valid)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOptions A, B, and D contain chemically impossible steps and are therefore incorrect. Option C describes a sequence of reactions that are all chemically plausible and lead to the correctly named target molecule. Although the \"high-yield\" claim in the question is questionable due to the formation of isomers in step (ii), Option C is the only chemically viable pathway among the choices.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, a rigorous step-by-step analysis of each proposed option is necessary.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Target Molecule**\n\nFirst, we must understand the structure and properties of the final product: **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n*   **Structure:** It is a benzene ring with three adjacent (1,2,3- or vicinal) substituents.\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt)\n    *   Position 2: tert-butyl group (-tBu)\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO₂)\n*   **Substituent Properties (Directing Effects for Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution):**\n    *   **-OEt (Ethoxy):** A strong activator and an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **-tBu (tert-Butyl):** A weak activator and an *ortho, para*-director. Its significant bulk sterically hinders substitution at the *ortho* positions.\n    *   **-NO₂ (Nitro):** A strong deactivator and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Synthetic Challenge:** The 1,2,3-substitution pattern is sterically crowded. The primary difficulty is introducing a substituent at a position *ortho* to the bulky tert-butyl group. Standard reactions on tert-butylbenzene heavily favor substitution at the *para* position. The \"high-yield\" requirement in the question is a crucial clue, suggesting a specific strategy is needed.\n\n### **2. Logical Synthesis Plan (Retrosynthesis)**\n\nWorking backward from the product can reveal the necessary intermediates.\n\n1.  The **ethoxy group** is an ether, which is reliably formed in high yield via the **Williamson ether synthesis**. This involves reacting the corresponding phenol with a base and an ethyl halide. This means the final step should be reacting **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol** with reagents like `NaOH/EtBr`.\n2.  A **phenol** is commonly synthesized from a primary aromatic amine via **diazotization** (`NaNO₂/HCl`) followed by hydrolysis with heat (`H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat`). The precursor must therefore be **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n3.  The central challenge is to synthesize **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. A logical approach is to nitrate 2-tert-butylaniline. In a strong acidic nitrating mixture (`HNO₃/H₂SO₄`), the amino group is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺). The -NH₃⁺ group at position 1 is a *meta*-director, and the -tBu group at position 2 is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 3.\n4.  This means we need **2-tert-butylaniline**, which is made by reducing **o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene** (`Fe/HCl`).\n5.  o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene is made by nitrating **tert-butylbenzene**. This is the problematic step for a \"high-yield\" synthesis, as nitration of tert-butylbenzene gives the *para* isomer as the major product.\n6.  Finally, tert-butylbenzene is made from benzene via Friedel-Crafts alkylation (`tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃`).\n\nThis entire sequence is chemically plausible but would not be high-yield due to the formation of the wrong isomer in step 5. We must now evaluate the given options to see which one is the most chemically sound.\n\n### **3. Evaluation of the Provided Options**\n\nWe will analyze each option as written in the prompt for chemical feasibility.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ... vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    This sequence attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt in step (vi). Diazonium salts are highly unstable intermediates used for replacement reactions, not as substrates for nitration. This step is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ... iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    This sequence is written in a nonsensical order. Step (iv) attempts a diazotization reaction (`NaNO₂/HCl`), which requires a primary aromatic amine. However, at this point in the sequence, no amine has been formed. This is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    This sequence fails at step (iii). It attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline (the product of steps i and ii). This reaction does not work because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    This sequence perfectly matches the logical pathway derived from our retrosynthesis.\n    *   **i-ii:** Forms tert-butylbenzene and then a mixture of o- and p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. To proceed, the minor *ortho* isomer must be used.\n    *   **iii:** Reduces the ortho isomer to 2-tert-butylaniline.\n    *   **iv:** Nitrates 2-tert-butylaniline to form 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline.\n    *   **v-vi:** Converts the amine to a phenol via a diazonium salt.\n    *   **vii:** Converts the phenol to the final ethoxy ether product.\n    The final steps (viii, ix) are superfluous, but the core synthesis (i-vii) is chemically sound and leads directly to the target molecule.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nOptions A, B, and D contain chemically impossible or nonsensical steps. Option C is the only sequence that describes a chemically viable pathway to the target molecule. Although the \"high-yield\" claim in the prompt is questionable due to the poor regioselectivity of the initial nitration step, Option C is unequivocally the best and only possible answer among the choices.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Deconstruction of the Task\nThe objective is to identify the correct sequence of reactions for the **high-yield** synthesis of **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**, starting from benzene. This requires a careful evaluation of each proposed pathway, considering reaction feasibility, regioselectivity (directing effects of substituents), and steric hindrance.\n\n### 2. Analysis of the Target Molecule\n*   **Product Name:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent (vicinal) substituents.\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt), a strongly activating, ortho/para-director.\n    *   Position 2: tert-butyl group (-tBu), a weakly activating, ortho/para-director. Its large size sterically hinders substitution at adjacent positions.\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO₂), a strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n*   **Key Synthetic Challenges:**\n    1.  The 1,2,3-substitution pattern is sterically crowded and difficult to achieve.\n    2.  The \"high-yield\" requirement is critical. Any step that produces significant amounts of isomers, requiring separation of a minor product, would violate this condition.\n    3.  A key retrosynthetic step for the ethoxy group is a Williamson ether synthesis on the corresponding phenol, which in turn would be made from an aniline derivative via a diazonium salt. This means the core of the problem is the synthesis of **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n\n### 3. Systematic Evaluation of the Options\n\nEach option must be checked for fatal flaws, such as impossible reactions or an illogical sequence.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    *   This sequence attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt in step (vi). Diazonium salts are highly unstable intermediates used for replacement reactions, not as substrates for nitration. This step is chemically impossible.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option A is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   This sequence attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline in step (iii). This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option B is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ... iv) NaNO2/HCl ; ... viii) Fe/HCl ...`\n    *   This sequence is in an illogical order. It attempts a diazotization reaction (step iv), which requires a primary amine, but the amine is not formed until much later in the sequence (step viii). A reaction cannot be performed on a functional group that is not yet present.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option C is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    *   This is the only sequence that does not contain a chemically impossible step. The core pathway (steps i-vii) is a valid series of transformations.\n    *   **Analysis of the Pathway:**\n        1.  The sequence begins with the formation of tert-butylbenzene.\n        2.  Step (ii) is the nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This is the critical step where the question's constraints conflict.\n            *   To achieve the **named product**, the synthesis must proceed through the minor *ortho*-nitro isomer. This violates the **\"high-yield\"** condition.\n            *   To satisfy the **\"high-yield\"** condition, the synthesis must proceed through the major *para*-nitro isomer, which would lead to a different final product (an isomer of the one named).\n    *   **Resolution:** Options A, B, and C are fundamentally flawed due to impossible chemical steps. Option D is the only sequence that is chemically plausible. The conflict between the \"high-yield\" descriptor and the final product name indicates a flaw in the question's design. However, in a multiple-choice format, a sequence with a plausible (even if low-yield) path to the named product must be chosen over sequences that are chemically impossible. By elimination, Option D is the only possible answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Goal\nThe objective is to identify a sequence of reactions that results in the **high-yield** synthesis of **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**, starting from benzene.\n\n### 2. Deconstruct the Target Molecule\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent (vicinal) substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2, and a nitro group (-NO₂) at position 3.\n*   **Key Features & Challenges:**\n    *   **1,2,3-Substitution Pattern:** This arrangement is often difficult to synthesize due to steric hindrance and conflicting directing effects of the substituents.\n    *   **Bulky Tert-Butyl Group:** The -tBu group is very large and sterically hinders substitution at its adjacent (ortho) positions. A simple nitration of tert-butylbenzene, for example, would overwhelmingly favor substitution at the distant (para) position.\n    *   **\"High-Yield\" Requirement:** This is a critical constraint. Any pathway that relies on separating a minor isomer from a mixture is not a high-yield process.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option for Chemical Feasibility\n\nWe will examine each proposed sequence for fatal flaws, such as impossible reactions or illogical ordering.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ... vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    *   This sequence begins with a valid \"blocking group\" strategy to force ortho substitution. However, step (vi) attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt formed in step (v).\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** Diazonium salts are highly unstable intermediates used for replacement reactions. They cannot be subjected to nitration; they would decompose under the harsh acidic conditions.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option A is chemically incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This option is written incoherently. It has duplicate step numbers and an illogical order of reactions (e.g., attempting diazotization with `NaNO2/HCl` before the necessary amine has been formed).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option B is chemically nonsensical.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   This sequence correctly forms aniline in steps (i) and (ii).\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option C is chemically incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    *   This is the only sequence without an immediately obvious fatal flaw. Let's analyze its viability:\n    1.  **Step i (Alkylation):** Forms tert-butylbenzene. (Valid)\n    2.  **Step ii (Nitration):** Nitrates tert-butylbenzene. This produces a mixture of ortho and para isomers. To make the target product, the minor *ortho* isomer must be separated and used. **This step is not high-yield.**\n    3.  **Step iii (Reduction):** Reduces the nitro group to an amine, forming 2-tert-butylaniline. (Valid)\n    4.  **Step iv (Nitration):** Nitrates 2-tert-butylaniline. In strong acid, the amine becomes the -NH₃⁺ ion (a meta-director) and the t-butyl group is an ortho,para-director. The directing effects cooperate for positions 3 and 5. However, due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group, substitution at position 5 is heavily favored over position 3. **This step would not give a high yield of the required 3-nitro isomer.**\n    5.  **Steps v-vii (Diazotization, Hydrolysis, Etherification):** These final steps are standard and chemically valid for converting the amine to the final ethoxy group.\n    *   **Conclusion:** While every reaction in this sequence is possible, it fails the \"high-yield\" requirement at two critical steps (ii and iv).\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThere is a significant issue with the question, as none of the options describe a high-yield synthesis of the named product.\n*   Options A, B, and C contain chemically impossible steps and are definitively incorrect.\n*   Option D describes a sequence of chemically possible reactions, but it is not a high-yield pathway and has major regioselectivity problems.\n\nIn the context of selecting the \"best\" answer from a flawed set of choices, the only logical approach is to eliminate the options that are chemically impossible. Option D is the only sequence that does not contain a reaction that cannot occur. Therefore, by elimination, it is the most plausible answer, despite its failure to meet the high-yield criterion.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Deconstruction of the Task\nThe goal is to identify a multi-step reaction sequence that starts with benzene and produces **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene** in **high yield**.\n\n### 2. Analysis of the Target Molecule\n*   **Structure:** The molecule has a benzene ring with three adjacent (vicinal) substituents:\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt)\n    *   Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu)\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO₂)\n*   **Substituent Properties (Directing Effects for Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution):**\n    *   **-OEt:** Strongly activating, directs incoming groups to the *ortho* and *para* positions.\n    *   **-tBu:** Weakly activating, directs *ortho* and *para*. Its large size sterically hinders substitution at the *ortho* positions, strongly favoring the *para* position.\n    *   **-NO₂:** Strongly deactivating, directs to the *meta* position.\n*   **Synthetic Challenge:** The 1,2,3-substitution pattern is sterically crowded. The \"high-yield\" requirement is particularly challenging because any direct nitration of tert-butylbenzene will produce the para-substituted product as the major isomer, not the ortho-substituted one needed for this synthesis.\n\n### 3. Systematic Evaluation of the Provided Options\n\nWe must analyze each sequence for chemical feasibility. A single impossible step invalidates the entire option.\n\n*   **Option C: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ...**\n    *   This sequence begins by forming aniline (steps i and ii).\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option C is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option B: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ iv) ; iii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) NaNO₂/HCl ...**\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This option is nonsensically written with duplicate step numbers. More importantly, step (iv) `NaNO₂/HCl` is a diazotization reaction, which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂). The substrate at this point (a sulfonated nitro-tert-butylbenzene) is not an amine.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option B is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option D: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ... v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...**\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** Step (vi) attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt formed in step (v). Diazonium salts are highly unstable intermediates used for replacement reactions (e.g., Sandmeyer, hydrolysis), not as substrates for further electrophilic substitution like nitration. They would decompose under these conditions.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option D is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...**\n    *   This is the only remaining option. Let's analyze its pathway:\n        1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃:** Benzene → **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n        2.  **ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. To reach the target, we must proceed with the minor *ortho* isomer. This step is chemically possible but contradicts the \"high-yield\" condition.\n        3.  **iii) Fe/HCl:** Reduction of the nitro group → **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n        4.  **iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. This allows for the formation of the required **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. (Valid)\n        5.  **v) NaNO₂/HCl:** Diazotization of the amino group to form a diazonium salt. (Valid)\n        6.  **vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat:** Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to form a phenol, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. (Valid)\n        7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Valid)\n    *   The final steps (viii and ix) are superfluous, but the core sequence from (i) to (vii) is chemically sound and leads to the correct target molecule.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nOptions B, C, and D each contain at least one chemically impossible or nonsensical step. Option A is the only sequence that describes a chemically plausible pathway to the target molecule. Although the \"high-yield\" claim is questionable due to the poor regioselectivity of the initial nitration step, it is the only viable choice among the given options.

Analyze the Target Molecule's Structure\n*   The molecule has three substituents on the benzene ring: an ethoxy group (-OEt), a tert-butyl group (-tBu), and a nitro group (-NO₂).\n*   The substitution pattern is 1,2,3 (vicinal), meaning the three groups are adjacent to each other. This is a sterically crowded arrangement that can be difficult to synthesize.\n*   **Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n    *   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** Activating, ortho/para-director. It is very bulky, so substitution at the *para* position is strongly favored over the *ortho* position.\n    *   **-OEt (ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho/para-director.\n    *   **-NO₂ (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   **-NH₂ (amino, an intermediate):** Strongly activating, ortho/para-director.\n    *   **-NH₃⁺ (anilinium, an intermediate in strong acid):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\n### 3.

Option D is the only sequence that describes a chemically plausible series of reactions that leads to the correctly named target molecule.\n\nWhile the synthesis described in Option D is not truly \"high-yield\" because it relies on the separation of a minor isomer in an early step, it is the only chemically viable pathway among the choices. In the context of a multiple-choice question, the only possible route must be selected over the impossible ones.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem requires a rigorous, step-by-step analysis of four complex organic synthesis pathways. The goal is to identify the sequence that leads to the **high-yield synthesis** of **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**, starting from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule and Synthetic Challenges\n\n*   **Structure:** The target molecule has three adjacent (vicinal) substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt), a tert-butyl group (-tBu), and a nitro group (-NO₂).\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** The tert-butyl group is extremely bulky, which makes substitution at its adjacent (ortho) positions very difficult. A simple nitration of tert-butylbenzene, for example, would yield the para-substituted product as the major isomer, making any synthesis that relies on the ortho-isomer inherently low-yield.\n*   **Directing Effects:** The synthesis must correctly manage the directing effects of all substituents at each stage.\n*   **\"High-Yield\" Condition:** This is a critical constraint. The correct pathway should not rely on separating a minor product from a major one.\n\n### 2. Systematic Evaluation of Each Option for Chemical Feasibility\n\nThe most effective way to solve this is to identify any chemically impossible or nonsensical steps in each sequence. A single fatal flaw invalidates an entire option.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    *   This sequence uses a blocking group strategy (steps i-iii), which is a good start for a high-yield synthesis. However, it fails at **step (vi)**. This step attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt formed in step (v). Diazonium salts are highly unstable intermediates used for replacement reactions, not as substrates for further nitration. They would decompose under these harsh conditions.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option A is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    *   This sequence is written in a chemically illogical order. **Step (iv)** attempts to perform a diazotization reaction (`NaNO₂/HCl`), which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂). However, at this point in the sequence, no amine has been formed.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option B is chemically nonsensical.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   This sequence fails at **step (iii)**. After forming aniline in steps (i) and (ii), it attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. This reaction does not work on aniline because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option D is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    *   This is the only sequence that does not contain a chemically impossible step. Let's trace the pathway:\n        1.  **i) Alkylation:** Benzene is converted to **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n        2.  **ii) Nitration:** tert-butylbenzene is nitrated. This gives a mixture of *ortho* and *para* isomers. To reach the target, one must proceed with the minor *ortho* isomer. This step contradicts the \"high-yield\" condition but is chemically possible.\n        3.  **iii) Reduction:** The nitro group is reduced to an amine, forming **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n        4.  **iv) Nitration:** This is a key step. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 3, forming **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. (Valid and regioselective)\n        5.  **v) Diazotization:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt. (Valid)\n        6.  **vi) Hydrolysis:** The diazonium salt is converted to a phenol, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. (Valid)\n        7.  **vii) Williamson Ether Synthesis:** The phenol is converted to the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Valid)\n    *   The final two steps (viii, ix) are superfluous but do not invalidate the core synthesis.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBy systematically analyzing each option, we find that options A, B, and D contain fatal chemical flaws—reactions that are impossible or nonsensical as written. Option C is the only sequence where every transformation is a valid, known chemical reaction that leads to the correctly named product. Although the initial nitration step is not high-yield, the overall sequence is the only chemically plausible pathway among the choices. Therefore, it must be the intended answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Question and Target Molecule\n\n*   **Task**: Find the sequence for the **high-yield** synthesis of **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Starting Material**: Benzene.\n*   **Target Molecule Structure**: A benzene ring with three adjacent (vicinal) substituents:\n    *   C1: -OEt (ethoxy), a strong activator and ortho/para-director.\n    *   C2: -tBu (tert-butyl), a weak activator and ortho/para-director. It is very bulky, which sterically hinders substitution at the adjacent ortho positions.\n    *   C3: -NO₂ (nitro), a strong deactivator and meta-director.\n*   **Key Challenge**: The question contains two potentially conflicting constraints: the synthesis must be \"high-yield,\" and it must produce the specific 1,2,3-substituted product. Synthesizing a product with a substituent ortho to a bulky tert-butyl group is typically a low-yield process.\n\n### 2. Analyze Each Option for Chemical Feasibility\n\nWe must evaluate each sequence as written in the problem description. A single chemically impossible step invalidates the entire option.\n\n*   **Option A**: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    *   This option is written unclearly, but the key flaw is step `iv) NaNO2/HCl`. This reagent is for diazotization, which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) as the substrate. The product from the preceding steps is a sulfonated nitro-tert-butylbenzene, not an amine.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Option A is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option C**: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    *   This sequence forms a diazonium salt in step (v). Step (vi) then attempts to nitrate this highly unstable intermediate. Nitrating a diazonium salt is not a standard or viable reaction; the salt would decompose under the harsh nitrating conditions.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Option C is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option D**: `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   This sequence correctly forms aniline in steps (i) and (ii). However, step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Option D is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option B**: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    *   This is the only option that does not contain a chemically impossible step. Let's trace the pathway:\n        1.  `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n        2.  `ii) HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of the *ortho* and *para* isomers.\n        3.  `iii) Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group to an amine.\n        4.  `iv) HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of the resulting aniline derivative.\n        5.  `v) NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of the amino group.\n        6.  `vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat`: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol.\n        7.  `vii) NaOH/EtBr`: Williamson ether synthesis to form the final ether.\n    *   **Analysis of the Ambiguity**: This sequence of reactions is entirely plausible. The conflict arises in step (ii). To get the **named product**, we must use the minor *ortho* isomer from this step, which makes the overall synthesis **low-yield**. To satisfy the **\"high-yield\"** condition, we would use the major *para* isomer, but this would lead to the wrong final product (an isomer).\n\n### 3. Final Conclusion\n\n*   Options A, C, and D are definitively incorrect because they contain chemically impossible reactions.\n*   Option B is the only sequence that describes a chemically plausible series of transformations.\n*   Although Option B cannot simultaneously satisfy the \"high-yield\" condition and produce the named product, it is the only viable choice. In such multiple-choice questions, a sequence that is merely inefficient is a better answer than sequences that are impossible. The most reasonable conclusion is that the \"high-yield\" descriptor in the question is inaccurate, and Option B represents the only possible pathway to the target molecule among the choices.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, a rigorous step-by-step analysis of each option is necessary.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Product Name:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Structure:** The molecule has a benzene ring with three adjacent (vicinal) substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1, a bulky tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2, and a nitro group (-NO₂) at position 3.\n*   **Synthetic Challenges:**\n    *   **Steric Hindrance:** The 1,2,3-substitution pattern is sterically crowded. Introducing a group ortho to the very large tert-butyl group is difficult. Standard electrophilic substitution on tert-butylbenzene heavily favors the para position.\n    *   **Directing Effects:** The synthesis must correctly navigate the activating/deactivating and ortho,para/meta directing effects of the substituents at each stage.\n    *   **\"High-Yield\" Constraint:** The question specifies a \"high-yield\" synthesis, meaning any pathway relying on the separation of a minor isomer is likely incorrect.\n\n### **2. Systematic Evaluation of Each Option**\n\nWe will evaluate each option as written in the prompt for chemical feasibility. A single impossible step invalidates the entire sequence.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   This sequence begins by forming aniline (steps i and ii). Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction is not feasible because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option A is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    *   This sequence forms a diazonium salt in step (v). Step (vi) then attempts to nitrate this highly reactive and unstable diazonium salt. This is not a standard or viable synthetic transformation; the diazonium salt would likely decompose under the harsh nitrating conditions.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option B is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    *   Step (iv) attempts a diazotization reaction (`NaNO2/HCl`). This reaction requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) as the starting material. The substrate produced after step (iii) is a sulfonated nitro-tert-butylbenzene, which is not an amine.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option C is chemically impossible.\n\n### **3. Detailed Analysis of the Remaining Option**\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    *   This is the only sequence that does not contain a fundamentally impossible step. Let's trace the pathway to see if it can lead to the target molecule.\n    1.  **Step i:** Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts alkylation to form **tert-butylbenzene**. This is a standard reaction.\n    2.  **Step ii:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. To reach the final product, the synthesis must proceed with the **minor ortho isomer**. This step is chemically possible but violates the \"high-yield\" condition.\n    3.  **Step iii:** The nitro group of the ortho isomer is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**. This is a standard reduction.\n    4.  **Step iv:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group at C2 is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 3, forming the required **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n    5.  **Step v:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt using `NaNO2/HCl`.\n    6.  **Step vi:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol with aqueous acid and heat, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    7.  **Step vii:** A Williamson ether synthesis is performed. The phenol is treated with base (`NaOH`) and an ethyl halide (`EtBr`) to form the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nOptions A, B, and C are fundamentally flawed because they contain chemically impossible reaction steps. By elimination, Option D is the only plausible choice. Although its first nitration step would give a low yield of the required isomer (conflicting with the \"high-yield\" claim in the prompt), the sequence of reactions itself is chemically sound and is the only one that can lead to the named target molecule. In the context of a multiple-choice question, a chemically possible but inefficient route is the correct answer over routes that are chemically impossible.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Deconstruction of the Question\n*   **Starting Material:** Benzene\n*   **Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Key Condition:** The synthesis must be \"high-yield\".\n\n### 2. Analysis of the Target Molecule's Structure\nThe target molecule is a benzene ring with three adjacent (vicinal) substituents:\n*   **Position 1:** Ethoxy group (-OEt), a strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   **Position 2:** tert-Butyl group (-tBu), a weakly activating, ortho, para-director. Its large size creates significant steric hindrance.\n*   **Position 3:** Nitro group (-NO₂), a strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\nThe primary synthetic challenge is introducing a substituent at position 3, which is *ortho* to the very bulky tert-butyl group at position 2. Standard electrophilic aromatic substitution on tert-butylbenzene strongly favors substitution at the *para* position, making an ortho-substituted product a minor component. This directly conflicts with the \"high-yield\" requirement.\n\n### 3. Evaluation of the Synthetic Pathways Presented by the Candidates\nThe candidate answers identify several proposed reaction sequences. We can categorize them into three groups: chemically impossible pathways, a high-yield pathway to the wrong product, and a low-yield pathway to the correct product.\n\n*   **Chemically Impossible Pathways:** Multiple candidates correctly identify that some of the proposed options contain fundamentally flawed chemical steps. These include:\n    *   **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation on Aniline:** This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring.\n    *   **Nitration of a Diazonium Salt:** Diazonium salts are highly unstable intermediates used for replacement reactions, not as substrates for nitration.\n    *   **Incorrect Reaction Order:** Attempting a reaction like diazotization before the necessary functional group (a primary amine) has been created.\n    *   Any option containing such a step is definitively incorrect.\n\n*   **Plausible Pathway to an Isomer (High-Yield):** Several candidates analyze a pathway that is chemically sound and high-yield, but produces an isomer of the target.\n    1.  Alkylation of benzene to form tert-butylbenzene.\n    2.  Nitration, proceeding with the **major para-isomer**.\n    3.  Reduction of the nitro group to an amine.\n    4.  A second nitration, which is regioselective.\n    5.  Conversion of the amine to an ethoxy group via diazotization, hydrolysis, and etherification.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This pathway is high-yield but produces **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**, not the requested product. Therefore, it is an incorrect answer to the question asked.\n\n*   **Plausible Pathway to the Correct Product (Low-Yield):** The most commonly identified viable pathway is the following:\n    1.  **Alkylation:** Benzene is converted to **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    2.  **Nitration:** This step produces a mixture of ortho- and para-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. To proceed, the **minor ortho-isomer** must be separated and used. This step is inherently **not high-yield**.\n    3.  **Reduction:** The ortho-nitro group is reduced to an amine, forming **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n    4.  **Nitration:** In the strongly acidic nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a meta-director. The tert-butyl group is an ortho, para-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to position 3, forming the required **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n    5.  **Diazotization, Hydrolysis, and Etherification:** The amino group is converted to a phenol and then to the final ethoxy ether, yielding **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence is the only one described that produces the correctly named target molecule.\n\n### 4. Final Decision\nWe are faced with a choice between a high-yield synthesis of the wrong molecule and a low-yield synthesis of the correct molecule.\n*   A synthesis that produces an incorrect isomer does not fulfill the primary goal of the question.\n*   A synthesis that produces the correct molecule, but violates the \"high-yield\" condition, is a flawed but direct answer to the question.\n\nIn a multiple-choice scenario, the pathway that leads to the named product must be considered the intended answer, even if it has imperfections. The \"high-yield\" descriptor is most likely an error in the question or a distractor. The sequence that proceeds through the minor ortho-nitro isomer is the only one that results in the correct final product. The majority of candidate answers identify this pathway as Option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, a careful step-by-step analysis of each option is necessary, paying close attention to reaction feasibility, regioselectivity, and directing group effects.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Product:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Structure:** The benzene ring has three adjacent (vicinal) substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at C1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at C2, and a nitro group (-NO₂) at C3.\n*   **Synthetic Challenges:**\n    *   The 1,2,3-substitution pattern is sterically crowded.\n    *   The tert-butyl group is very bulky and sterically hinders substitution at its ortho positions (C2 and C6). Standard electrophilic substitution on tert-butylbenzene strongly favors the para position.\n    *   The question specifies a \"high-yield\" synthesis, which means any pathway relying on the separation of a minor isomer is likely incorrect.\n\n### **2. Systematic Evaluation of Each Option**\n\nWe will evaluate each proposed sequence for chemical feasibility.\n\n*   **Option A: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ...**\n    This sequence begins by forming aniline (steps i and ii). Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction is not feasible because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation.\n    **Conclusion: Option A is chemically impossible.**\n\n*   **Option B: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ iv) ; iii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) NaNO₂/HCl ...**\n    This sequence is written in a confusing order. However, it attempts a diazotization reaction (step iv, `NaNO₂/HCl`) on the product from the preceding steps. Diazotization requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) as the starting material. At this point in the sequence, the substrate is a sulfonated nitro-tert-butylbenzene, not an amine.\n    **Conclusion: Option B is chemically impossible.**\n\n*   **Option C: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ... v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...**\n    This sequence proceeds to form a diazonium salt in step (v). Step (vi) then attempts to nitrate this highly reactive and unstable diazonium salt. This is not a standard or viable synthetic transformation; diazonium salts are used for replacement reactions, not as substrates for further nitration.\n    **Conclusion: Option C is chemically impossible.**\n\n*   **Option D: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...**\n    This is the only sequence that does not contain a chemically impossible step. Let's trace the pathway:\n    1.  **i) Friedel-Crafts Alkylation:** Benzene is converted to **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    2.  **ii) Nitration:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene gives a mixture of ortho- and para-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. To reach the target molecule, the synthesis must proceed with the **ortho isomer**, which is the minor product due to steric hindrance. This step contradicts the \"high-yield\" condition of the prompt.\n    3.  **iii) Reduction:** The nitro group of the ortho isomer is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n    4.  **iv) Nitration:** In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a meta-director. The tert-butyl group at C2 is an ortho, para-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 3, forming **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n    5.  **v) Diazotization:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt.\n    6.  **vi) Hydrolysis:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    7.  **vii) Williamson Ether Synthesis:** The phenol is converted to the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nOptions A, B, and C are fundamentally flawed as they contain chemically impossible reaction steps. Option D is the only sequence that is chemically plausible from start to finish and leads to the correctly named target molecule.\n\nThe primary issue with Option D is that the second step (nitration of tert-butylbenzene) is not high-yield for the required ortho isomer. However, in the context of a multiple-choice question, a chemically possible but inefficient pathway is the only correct choice when all other options are chemically impossible. The flaw lies in the question's \"high-yield\" premise, not in the chemical logic of sequence D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Goals\nThe objective is to find a high-yield synthesis for **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene** starting from benzene.\n\n*   **Structure:** The molecule has three adjacent (vicinal) substituents on a benzene ring: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at C1, a bulky tert-butyl group (-tBu) at C2, and a nitro group (-NO₂) at C3.\n*   **Key Challenges:**\n    *   The 1,2,3-substitution pattern is sterically crowded.\n    *   Introducing a substituent *ortho* to the very bulky tert-butyl group via standard electrophilic aromatic substitution is difficult and typically results in low yields, as the *para* position is heavily favored.\n    *   The \"high-yield\" constraint is critical and must be considered when evaluating pathways.\n\n### 2. Systematic Elimination of Chemically Impossible Options\nThe most effective strategy is to first identify and eliminate any proposed sequences that contain chemically impossible or nonsensical steps.\n\n*   **Option C: `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`**\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This sequence fails at step (iii). It attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline (the product of steps i and ii). This reaction is not feasible because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation.

Step (iv), a diazotization reaction (`NaNO₂/HCl`), requires a primary aromatic amine as a starting material. However, the amine is not formed until much later in the sequence (step viii). A reaction cannot be performed on a functional group that is not yet present.

It attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt, which was formed in step (v). Diazonium salts are highly unstable intermediates used for replacement reactions (e.g., Sandmeyer reaction, hydrolysis to phenols). They are not suitable substrates for nitration and would decompose under the harsh reaction conditions. This option is chemically impossible.\n\n### 3.

The phenol is treated with base (`NaOH`) and an ethyl halide (`EtBr`) to form the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Valid)\n\n### 4. Final Conclusion and Resolution of the \"High-Yield\" Conflict\nOptions A, C, and D are definitively incorrect because they contain chemically impossible steps. Option B is the only sequence that describes a chemically plausible series of transformations that leads to the correctly named target molecule.\n\nThe conflict arises from the \"high-yield\" constraint in the question.

Analyze the Target Molecule\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent (vicinal) substituents.\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt)\n    *   Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu)\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO₂)\n*   **Key Synthetic Challenges:**\n    *   The 1,2,3-substitution pattern is sterically crowded.\n    *   The tert-butyl group is very bulky, which sterically hinders substitution at the adjacent (ortho) positions. Standard nitration of tert-butylbenzene heavily favors the para product.\n    *   The final arrangement has an activating group (-OEt) meta to a deactivating group (-NO₂).\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option for Chemical Feasibility\n\nA valid synthetic sequence must consist of chemically possible reactions in a logical order. A single impossible step invalidates the entire option.\n\n*   **Option C: `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`**\n    *   This sequence starts by forming aniline (steps i and ii).\n    *   Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. **This reaction is impossible.** The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option C is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`**\n    *   This sequence forms a diazonium salt in step (v).\n    *   Step (vi) then attempts to nitrate this highly unstable diazonium salt intermediate. **This is not a standard or viable synthetic reaction.** Diazonium salts are used for replacement reactions, not as substrates for further electrophilic substitution.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B: `... iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ; ... viii) Fe/HCl ...`**\n    *   This sequence is written in a chemically illogical order.\n    *   Step (iv) attempts to perform a diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`), which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂). However, the amine is not formed until a much later step (viii, `Fe/HCl`). A reaction cannot be performed on a functional group that does not yet exist.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option B is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option A: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ...`**\n    *   Since options B, C, and D are chemically impossible, this is the only remaining possibility. Let's analyze its pathway:\n    1.  **i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`**: Benzene → **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid Friedel-Crafts alkylation).\n    2.  **ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`**: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of ortho- and para-isomers. To reach the target, we must proceed with the minor **ortho-isomer (1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene)**. This step is chemically possible, but it is not high-yield.\n    3.  **iii) `Fe/HCl`**: Reduction of the nitro group → **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid).\n    4.  **iv) `HNO3/H2SO4`**: Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a meta-director. The tert-butyl group is an ortho, para-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 3, forming **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. (This is a valid and key step).\n    5.  **v) `NaNO2/HCl`**: Diazotization of the amino group to form a diazonium salt. (Valid).\n    6.  **vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`**: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol → **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. (Valid).\n    7.  **vii) `NaOH/EtBr`**: Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Valid).\n    8.  The final steps (viii, ix) are superfluous but do not invalidate the core synthesis.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nOptions B, C, and D contain chemically impossible or nonsensically ordered steps, rendering them invalid. Option A is the only sequence that describes a chemically plausible pathway from start to finish that produces the correctly named target molecule. Although the \"high-yield\" claim in the question is contradicted by the poor regioselectivity of the initial nitration step, Option A is the only viable choice among the given options.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n### 1. Deconstruction of the Target Molecule and Synthetic Goals\n*   **Target Molecule**: 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Structure**: The molecule has three adjacent (vicinal) substituents on a benzene ring: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at C1, a bulky tert-butyl group (-tBu) at C2, and a nitro group (-NO₂) at C3.\n*   **Key Constraint**: The question specifies a \"high-yield\" synthesis. This is a critical factor in evaluating the proposed pathways.\n*   **Synthetic Challenges**:\n    *   The 1,2,3-substitution pattern is sterically crowded and electronically complex to achieve.\n    *   Introducing a substituent *ortho* to the very bulky tert-butyl group is difficult via standard electrophilic aromatic substitution, which strongly favors the *para* position.\n    *   The final arrangement has an activating group (-OEt) meta to a deactivating group (-NO₂).\n\n### 2. Analysis of the Final Synthetic Steps (Retrosynthesis)\nA common and effective way to form an aryl ether (the ethoxy group) is the Williamson ether synthesis. This involves reacting the corresponding phenol with a base and an ethyl halide.\n*   **Final Step**: The reaction would be `2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol + NaOH/EtBr → 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene`. This matches step `vii) NaOH/EtBr` found in the options.\n*   **Precursor to the Phenol**: A standard method to create a phenol is through the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine, followed by hydrolysis. This means the key intermediate before the final two steps is **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n*   **Core Problem**: The central challenge is to synthesize **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline** from benzene.\n\n### 3. Systematic Evaluation of Each Option\n\nWe will now evaluate each option for chemical feasibility. A single impossible step invalidates the entire sequence.\n\n*   **Option A**: `...v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    This sequence attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt (formed in step v). Diazonium salts are highly unstable intermediates used for replacement reactions, not as substrates for nitration. They would decompose under these conditions.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Option A is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option C**: `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    This sequence starts by forming aniline (steps i and ii). Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) complexes with the basic amino group, strongly deactivating the ring and preventing alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Option C is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option D**: `...iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    This sequence is written in an illogical order. Step (iv) is a diazotization reaction (`NaNO₂/HCl`), which requires a primary aromatic amine. However, at this point in the sequence, no amine has been formed.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Option D is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option B**: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    This is the only remaining option. Let's analyze its chemical logic step-by-step:\n    1.  **i) Friedel-Crafts Alkylation**: Benzene is converted to **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n    2.  **ii) Nitration**: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene gives a mixture of ortho and para isomers. To reach the target molecule, the **ortho isomer (1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene)** must be used. This is the minor product due to steric hindrance from the t-butyl group, which conflicts with the \"high-yield\" requirement. However, the reaction is chemically possible.\n    3.  **iii) Reduction**: The nitro group is reduced to an amine, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n    4.  **iv) Nitration**: This is a key step. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a meta-director. The t-butyl group is an ortho, para-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 3, forming the required **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. (Valid)\n    5.  **v) Diazotization**: The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt. (Valid)\n    6.  **vi) Hydrolysis**: The diazonium salt is heated in aqueous acid to form a phenol, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. (Valid)\n    7.  **vii) Williamson Ether Synthesis**: The phenol is converted to the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Valid)\n    8.  The final steps (viii and ix) are superfluous but do not invalidate the core synthesis.\n\n### Final Decision\nOptions A, C, and D contain fundamentally impossible chemical steps and must be eliminated. Option B describes a sequence of reactions that is chemically plausible and is the only one that can lead to the named target molecule. While the low yield of the initial nitration step contradicts the \"high-yield\" condition in the prompt, this is likely a flaw in the question's wording. In a multiple-choice format, the only chemically possible route to the correct product is the intended answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to systematically evaluate each of the four proposed reaction sequences. For each option, I will analyze the chemical transformations step-by-step, considering reaction feasibility, regioselectivity (directing effects of substituents), and steric hindrance. The goal is to identify the single sequence that is chemically plausible and leads to the target molecule, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. I will pay special attention to common pitfalls like attempting reactions on incompatible functional groups (e.g., Friedel-Crafts on aniline) or using reagents in an illogical order. The final decision will be based on eliminating the chemically impossible options to find the only viable pathway, even if it has practical limitations (like low yield).\n\n```python\ndef solve_organic_synthesis():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes four multi-step synthesis options to find the correct pathway to\n    2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Target Molecule: 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n    # This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring.\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the reaction sequences to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene:\")\n\n    # Analysis of Option A\n    print(\"\\n--- Analyzing Option A ---\")\n    print(\"Sequence: i) t-BuCl/AlCl3; ii) SO3/H2SO4; iii) HNO3/H2SO4; iv) Fe/HCl; v) NaNO2/HCl; vi) HNO3/H2SO4...\")\n    print(\"Flaw: Step (vi) attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt formed in step (v).

Deconstruction of the Question\n*   **Goal:** Identify the correct reaction sequence for the **high-yield** synthesis of **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Starting Material:** Benzene.\n*   **Target Molecule Analysis:**\n    *   It is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   Substituents: -OEt (ethoxy, strong activator, o,p-director), -tBu (tert-butyl, weak activator, o,p-director, very bulky), -NO₂ (nitro, strong deactivator, m-director).\n    *   The 1,2,3 pattern is sterically crowded.\n*   **Key Constraints:** The sequence must be chemically feasible, and the question specifies \"high-yield\".\n\n### 2. Analysis of Each Option for Chemical Feasibility\n\nThe most crucial step is to check if each proposed sequence contains any chemically impossible reactions.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    *   This sequence fails at step (iv). The reagent `NaNO2/HCl` is used for diazotization, which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) as the starting material. The product after step (iii) is a sulfonic acid, not an amine.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option A is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   This sequence fails at step (iii). It attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline (the product of steps i and ii). Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on aniline because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option C is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    *   This sequence fails at step (vi). It attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt (formed in step v). Diazonium salts are highly unstable intermediates used for replacement reactions (e.g., with H₂O, CuX), not for subsequent electrophilic aromatic substitution like nitration. The harsh nitrating conditions would cause decomposition.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option D is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    *   This is the only sequence that does not contain an immediately obvious impossible step. Let's trace its chemical pathway.\n    1.  **i) Friedel-Crafts Alkylation:** Benzene → **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n    2.  **ii) Nitration:** tert-butylbenzene → mixture of o- and p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. (Valid)\n    3.  **iii) Reduction:** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group. (Valid)\n    4.  **iv) Nitration:** The aniline derivative is nitrated again. (Valid)\n    5.  **v) Diazotization:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt. (Valid)\n    6.  **vi) Hydrolysis:** The diazonium salt is converted to a phenol. (Valid)\n    7.  **vii) Williamson Ether Synthesis:** The phenol is converted to the final ethoxy ether. (Valid)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Every step in this sequence represents a valid chemical transformation.\n\n### 3. Resolving the \"High-Yield\" vs. \"Target Molecule\" Conflict\n\nWhile Option B is the only chemically possible sequence, there is a conflict between the \"high-yield\" requirement and the identity of the final product.\n\n*   **Path to Target Molecule (Low Yield):** To get the named product, one must use the minor *ortho* isomer from step (ii). This violates the \"high-yield\" condition but does lead to the correct structure.\n*   **High-Yield Path (to Isomer):** Following the major *para* isomer from step (ii) leads to a high-yield synthesis of **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**, an isomer of the target.\n\n### 4. Final Decision\n\nIn a multiple-choice question, a sequence with a chemically impossible step is fundamentally incorrect. Options A, C, and D are all invalid for this reason. Option B is the only sequence composed entirely of valid chemical reactions. Therefore, by elimination, it must be the intended answer. The question is flawed because the pathway in Option B cannot be both high-yield *and* lead to the named product, but it is the only viable choice among the options provided.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n*   **Product Name:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2, and a nitro group (-NO₂) at position 3.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted (vicinal) pattern. This arrangement is often challenging to synthesize due to steric hindrance and the need to control the directing effects of multiple substituents.\n*   **Substituent Properties:**\n    *   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** An activating group and an *ortho, para*-director. It is very bulky, which sterically hinders substitution at its *ortho* positions, making *para* substitution heavily favored.\n    *   **-NO₂ (nitro):** A deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n    *   **-OEt (ethoxy):** A strongly activating group and an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **-NH₂ (amino, an intermediate):** A strongly activating group and an *ortho, para*-director. In strong acid, it becomes the **-NH₃⁺ (anilinium) ion**, which is a deactivating *meta*-director.\n\n### 2. Evaluate Each Option for Chemical Feasibility\n\nWe must analyze each sequence as written to identify any chemically impossible or illogical steps. A single fatal flaw invalidates an entire option.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    *   This sequence fails at step (iv). The reagent `NaNO2/HCl` is used for diazotization, a reaction that requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) as the starting material. The product after step (iii) is a sulfonated nitro-tert-butylbenzene, which is not an amine. Therefore, this sequence is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    *   This sequence fails at step (vi). It attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt, which is formed in step (v). Diazonium salts are highly unstable intermediates used for replacement reactions (e.g., Sandmeyer reaction, hydrolysis to phenols). They are not suitable substrates for nitration and would decompose under the harsh conditions. Therefore, this sequence is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) t-BuCl/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   This sequence fails at step (iii). It attempts to perform a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline (the product of steps i and ii). This reaction does not work because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the aromatic ring and prevents alkylation. Therefore, this sequence is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    *   This is the only remaining option. Let's trace the pathway to confirm its validity.\n    1.  **Step i:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene forms **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n    2.  **Step ii:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. To reach the target molecule, we must proceed with the minor *ortho* isomer. While this step is not high-yield, it is chemically possible.\n    3.  **Step iii:** Reduction of the nitro group in 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene yields **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n    4.  **Step iv:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 3, forming **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. (Valid)\n    5.  **Step v:** Diazotization of the amino group forms a diazonium salt. (Valid)\n    6.  **Step vi:** Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt yields **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. (Valid)\n    7.  **Step vii:** Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Valid)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOptions A, B, and D contain chemically impossible steps and are therefore incorrect. Option C describes a sequence of reactions that are all chemically plausible and lead to the correctly named target molecule. Although the \"high-yield\" claim in the question is questionable due to the formation of isomers in step (ii), Option C is the only chemically viable pathway among the choices.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, a rigorous step-by-step analysis of each proposed option is necessary.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Target Molecule**\n\nFirst, we must understand the structure and properties of the final product: **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n*   **Structure:** It is a benzene ring with three adjacent (1,2,3- or vicinal) substituents.\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt)\n    *   Position 2: tert-butyl group (-tBu)\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO₂)\n*   **Substituent Properties (Directing Effects for Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution):**\n    *   **-OEt (Ethoxy):** A strong activator and an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **-tBu (tert-Butyl):** A weak activator and an *ortho, para*-director. Its significant bulk sterically hinders substitution at the *ortho* positions.\n    *   **-NO₂ (Nitro):** A strong deactivator and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Synthetic Challenge:** The 1,2,3-substitution pattern is sterically crowded. The primary difficulty is introducing a substituent at a position *ortho* to the bulky tert-butyl group. Standard reactions on tert-butylbenzene heavily favor substitution at the *para* position. The \"high-yield\" requirement in the question is a crucial clue, suggesting a specific strategy is needed.\n\n### **2. Logical Synthesis Plan (Retrosynthesis)**\n\nWorking backward from the product can reveal the necessary intermediates.\n\n1.  The **ethoxy group** is an ether, which is reliably formed in high yield via the **Williamson ether synthesis**. This involves reacting the corresponding phenol with a base and an ethyl halide. This means the final step should be reacting **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol** with reagents like `NaOH/EtBr`.\n2.  A **phenol** is commonly synthesized from a primary aromatic amine via **diazotization** (`NaNO₂/HCl`) followed by hydrolysis with heat (`H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat`). The precursor must therefore be **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n3.  The central challenge is to synthesize **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. A logical approach is to nitrate 2-tert-butylaniline. In a strong acidic nitrating mixture (`HNO₃/H₂SO₄`), the amino group is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺). The -NH₃⁺ group at position 1 is a *meta*-director, and the -tBu group at position 2 is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 3.\n4.  This means we need **2-tert-butylaniline**, which is made by reducing **o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene** (`Fe/HCl`).\n5.  o-nitro-tert-butylbenzene is made by nitrating **tert-butylbenzene**. This is the problematic step for a \"high-yield\" synthesis, as nitration of tert-butylbenzene gives the *para* isomer as the major product.\n6.  Finally, tert-butylbenzene is made from benzene via Friedel-Crafts alkylation (`tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃`).\n\nThis entire sequence is chemically plausible but would not be high-yield due to the formation of the wrong isomer in step 5. We must now evaluate the given options to see which one is the most chemically sound.\n\n### **3. Evaluation of the Provided Options**\n\nWe will analyze each option as written in the prompt for chemical feasibility.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ... vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    This sequence attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt in step (vi). Diazonium salts are highly unstable intermediates used for replacement reactions, not as substrates for nitration. This step is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ... iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    This sequence is written in a nonsensical order. Step (iv) attempts a diazotization reaction (`NaNO₂/HCl`), which requires a primary aromatic amine. However, at this point in the sequence, no amine has been formed. This is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    This sequence fails at step (iii). It attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline (the product of steps i and ii). This reaction does not work because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    This sequence perfectly matches the logical pathway derived from our retrosynthesis.\n    *   **i-ii:** Forms tert-butylbenzene and then a mixture of o- and p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. To proceed, the minor *ortho* isomer must be used.\n    *   **iii:** Reduces the ortho isomer to 2-tert-butylaniline.\n    *   **iv:** Nitrates 2-tert-butylaniline to form 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline.\n    *   **v-vi:** Converts the amine to a phenol via a diazonium salt.\n    *   **vii:** Converts the phenol to the final ethoxy ether product.\n    The final steps (viii, ix) are superfluous, but the core synthesis (i-vii) is chemically sound and leads directly to the target molecule.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nOptions A, B, and D contain chemically impossible or nonsensical steps. Option C is the only sequence that describes a chemically viable pathway to the target molecule. Although the \"high-yield\" claim in the prompt is questionable due to the poor regioselectivity of the initial nitration step, Option C is unequivocally the best and only possible answer among the choices.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Deconstruction of the Task\nThe objective is to identify the correct sequence of reactions for the **high-yield** synthesis of **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**, starting from benzene. This requires a careful evaluation of each proposed pathway, considering reaction feasibility, regioselectivity (directing effects of substituents), and steric hindrance.\n\n### 2. Analysis of the Target Molecule\n*   **Product Name:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent (vicinal) substituents.\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt), a strongly activating, ortho/para-director.\n    *   Position 2: tert-butyl group (-tBu), a weakly activating, ortho/para-director. Its large size sterically hinders substitution at adjacent positions.\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO₂), a strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n*   **Key Synthetic Challenges:**\n    1.  The 1,2,3-substitution pattern is sterically crowded and difficult to achieve.\n    2.  The \"high-yield\" requirement is critical. Any step that produces significant amounts of isomers, requiring separation of a minor product, would violate this condition.\n    3.  A key retrosynthetic step for the ethoxy group is a Williamson ether synthesis on the corresponding phenol, which in turn would be made from an aniline derivative via a diazonium salt. This means the core of the problem is the synthesis of **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n\n### 3. Systematic Evaluation of the Options\n\nEach option must be checked for fatal flaws, such as impossible reactions or an illogical sequence.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    *   This sequence attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt in step (vi). Diazonium salts are highly unstable intermediates used for replacement reactions, not as substrates for nitration. This step is chemically impossible.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option A is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   This sequence attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline in step (iii). This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option B is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ... iv) NaNO2/HCl ; ... viii) Fe/HCl ...`\n    *   This sequence is in an illogical order. It attempts a diazotization reaction (step iv), which requires a primary amine, but the amine is not formed until much later in the sequence (step viii). A reaction cannot be performed on a functional group that is not yet present.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option C is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    *   This is the only sequence that does not contain a chemically impossible step. The core pathway (steps i-vii) is a valid series of transformations.\n    *   **Analysis of the Pathway:**\n        1.  The sequence begins with the formation of tert-butylbenzene.\n        2.  Step (ii) is the nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This is the critical step where the question's constraints conflict.\n            *   To achieve the **named product**, the synthesis must proceed through the minor *ortho*-nitro isomer. This violates the **\"high-yield\"** condition.\n            *   To satisfy the **\"high-yield\"** condition, the synthesis must proceed through the major *para*-nitro isomer, which would lead to a different final product (an isomer of the one named).\n    *   **Resolution:** Options A, B, and C are fundamentally flawed due to impossible chemical steps. Option D is the only sequence that is chemically plausible. The conflict between the \"high-yield\" descriptor and the final product name indicates a flaw in the question's design. However, in a multiple-choice format, a sequence with a plausible (even if low-yield) path to the named product must be chosen over sequences that are chemically impossible. By elimination, Option D is the only possible answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Goal\nThe objective is to identify a sequence of reactions that results in the **high-yield** synthesis of **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**, starting from benzene.\n\n### 2. Deconstruct the Target Molecule\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent (vicinal) substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2, and a nitro group (-NO₂) at position 3.\n*   **Key Features & Challenges:**\n    *   **1,2,3-Substitution Pattern:** This arrangement is often difficult to synthesize due to steric hindrance and conflicting directing effects of the substituents.\n    *   **Bulky Tert-Butyl Group:** The -tBu group is very large and sterically hinders substitution at its adjacent (ortho) positions. A simple nitration of tert-butylbenzene, for example, would overwhelmingly favor substitution at the distant (para) position.\n    *   **\"High-Yield\" Requirement:** This is a critical constraint. Any pathway that relies on separating a minor isomer from a mixture is not a high-yield process.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option for Chemical Feasibility\n\nWe will examine each proposed sequence for fatal flaws, such as impossible reactions or illogical ordering.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ... vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    *   This sequence begins with a valid \"blocking group\" strategy to force ortho substitution. However, step (vi) attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt formed in step (v).\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** Diazonium salts are highly unstable intermediates used for replacement reactions. They cannot be subjected to nitration; they would decompose under the harsh acidic conditions.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option A is chemically incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This option is written incoherently. It has duplicate step numbers and an illogical order of reactions (e.g., attempting diazotization with `NaNO2/HCl` before the necessary amine has been formed).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option B is chemically nonsensical.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   This sequence correctly forms aniline in steps (i) and (ii).\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option C is chemically incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    *   This is the only sequence without an immediately obvious fatal flaw. Let's analyze its viability:\n    1.  **Step i (Alkylation):** Forms tert-butylbenzene. (Valid)\n    2.  **Step ii (Nitration):** Nitrates tert-butylbenzene. This produces a mixture of ortho and para isomers. To make the target product, the minor *ortho* isomer must be separated and used. **This step is not high-yield.**\n    3.  **Step iii (Reduction):** Reduces the nitro group to an amine, forming 2-tert-butylaniline. (Valid)\n    4.  **Step iv (Nitration):** Nitrates 2-tert-butylaniline. In strong acid, the amine becomes the -NH₃⁺ ion (a meta-director) and the t-butyl group is an ortho,para-director. The directing effects cooperate for positions 3 and 5. However, due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group, substitution at position 5 is heavily favored over position 3. **This step would not give a high yield of the required 3-nitro isomer.**\n    5.  **Steps v-vii (Diazotization, Hydrolysis, Etherification):** These final steps are standard and chemically valid for converting the amine to the final ethoxy group.\n    *   **Conclusion:** While every reaction in this sequence is possible, it fails the \"high-yield\" requirement at two critical steps (ii and iv).\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThere is a significant issue with the question, as none of the options describe a high-yield synthesis of the named product.\n*   Options A, B, and C contain chemically impossible steps and are definitively incorrect.\n*   Option D describes a sequence of chemically possible reactions, but it is not a high-yield pathway and has major regioselectivity problems.\n\nIn the context of selecting the \"best\" answer from a flawed set of choices, the only logical approach is to eliminate the options that are chemically impossible. Option D is the only sequence that does not contain a reaction that cannot occur. Therefore, by elimination, it is the most plausible answer, despite its failure to meet the high-yield criterion.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Deconstruction of the Task\nThe goal is to identify a multi-step reaction sequence that starts with benzene and produces **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene** in **high yield**.\n\n### 2. Analysis of the Target Molecule\n*   **Structure:** The molecule has a benzene ring with three adjacent (vicinal) substituents:\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt)\n    *   Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu)\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO₂)\n*   **Substituent Properties (Directing Effects for Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution):**\n    *   **-OEt:** Strongly activating, directs incoming groups to the *ortho* and *para* positions.\n    *   **-tBu:** Weakly activating, directs *ortho* and *para*. Its large size sterically hinders substitution at the *ortho* positions, strongly favoring the *para* position.\n    *   **-NO₂:** Strongly deactivating, directs to the *meta* position.\n*   **Synthetic Challenge:** The 1,2,3-substitution pattern is sterically crowded. The \"high-yield\" requirement is particularly challenging because any direct nitration of tert-butylbenzene will produce the para-substituted product as the major isomer, not the ortho-substituted one needed for this synthesis.\n\n### 3. Systematic Evaluation of the Provided Options\n\nWe must analyze each sequence for chemical feasibility. A single impossible step invalidates the entire option.\n\n*   **Option C: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ...**\n    *   This sequence begins by forming aniline (steps i and ii).\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option C is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option B: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ iv) ; iii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) NaNO₂/HCl ...**\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** This option is nonsensically written with duplicate step numbers. More importantly, step (iv) `NaNO₂/HCl` is a diazotization reaction, which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂). The substrate at this point (a sulfonated nitro-tert-butylbenzene) is not an amine.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option B is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option D: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ... v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...**\n    *   **Fatal Flaw:** Step (vi) attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt formed in step (v). Diazonium salts are highly unstable intermediates used for replacement reactions (e.g., Sandmeyer, hydrolysis), not as substrates for further electrophilic substitution like nitration. They would decompose under these conditions.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option D is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...**\n    *   This is the only remaining option. Let's analyze its pathway:\n        1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃:** Benzene → **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n        2.  **ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. To reach the target, we must proceed with the minor *ortho* isomer. This step is chemically possible but contradicts the \"high-yield\" condition.\n        3.  **iii) Fe/HCl:** Reduction of the nitro group → **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n        4.  **iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. This allows for the formation of the required **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. (Valid)\n        5.  **v) NaNO₂/HCl:** Diazotization of the amino group to form a diazonium salt. (Valid)\n        6.  **vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat:** Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to form a phenol, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. (Valid)\n        7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol to the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Valid)\n    *   The final steps (viii and ix) are superfluous, but the core sequence from (i) to (vii) is chemically sound and leads to the correct target molecule.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nOptions B, C, and D each contain at least one chemically impossible or nonsensical step. Option A is the only sequence that describes a chemically plausible pathway to the target molecule. Although the \"high-yield\" claim is questionable due to the poor regioselectivity of the initial nitration step, it is the only viable choice among the given options. In multiple-choice questions, a chemically possible route must be chosen over impossible ones.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Question\n*   **Task:** Find the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize a specific molecule.\n*   **Starting Material:** Benzene.\n*   **Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Constraint:** The synthesis should be \"high-yield\".\n\n### 2. Analyze the Target Molecule's Structure\n*   The molecule has three substituents on the benzene ring: an ethoxy group (-OEt), a tert-butyl group (-tBu), and a nitro group (-NO₂).\n*   The substitution pattern is 1,2,3 (vicinal), meaning the three groups are adjacent to each other. This is a sterically crowded arrangement that can be difficult to synthesize.\n*   **Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n    *   **-tBu (tert-butyl):** Activating, ortho/para-director. It is very bulky, so substitution at the *para* position is strongly favored over the *ortho* position.\n    *   **-OEt (ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho/para-director.\n    *   **-NO₂ (nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   **-NH₂ (amino, an intermediate):** Strongly activating, ortho/para-director.\n    *   **-NH₃⁺ (anilinium, an intermediate in strong acid):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\n### 3.

However, no amine has been formed by this point in the sequence.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This option is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ... vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    *   This sequence proceeds to form a diazonium salt in step (v). Step (vi) then attempts to nitrate this highly unstable diazonium salt. This is not a standard or viable synthetic reaction; the salt would decompose.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This option is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    *   This is the only sequence that does not contain an obvious fatal flaw.

(Valid)\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nOptions A, B, and C are fundamentally flawed as they contain chemically impossible steps. Option D is the only sequence that describes a chemically plausible series of reactions that leads to the correctly named target molecule.\n\nWhile the synthesis described in Option D is not truly \"high-yield\" because it relies on the separation of a minor isomer in an early step, it is the only chemically viable pathway among the choices. In the context of a multiple-choice question, the only possible route must be selected over the impossible ones.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem requires a rigorous, step-by-step analysis of four complex organic synthesis pathways. The goal is to identify the sequence that leads to the **high-yield synthesis** of **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**, starting from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule and Synthetic Challenges\n\n*   **Structure:** The target molecule has three adjacent (vicinal) substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt), a tert-butyl group (-tBu), and a nitro group (-NO₂).\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** The tert-butyl group is extremely bulky, which makes substitution at its adjacent (ortho) positions very difficult. A simple nitration of tert-butylbenzene, for example, would yield the para-substituted product as the major isomer, making any synthesis that relies on the ortho-isomer inherently low-yield.\n*   **Directing Effects:** The synthesis must correctly manage the directing effects of all substituents at each stage.\n*   **\"High-Yield\" Condition:** This is a critical constraint. The correct pathway should not rely on separating a minor product from a major one.\n\n### 2. Systematic Evaluation of Each Option for Chemical Feasibility\n\nThe most effective way to solve this is to identify any chemically impossible or nonsensical steps in each sequence. A single fatal flaw invalidates an entire option.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    *   This sequence uses a blocking group strategy (steps i-iii), which is a good start for a high-yield synthesis. However, it fails at **step (vi)**. This step attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt formed in step (v). Diazonium salts are highly unstable intermediates used for replacement reactions, not as substrates for further nitration. They would decompose under these harsh conditions.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option A is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    *   This sequence is written in a chemically illogical order. **Step (iv)** attempts to perform a diazotization reaction (`NaNO₂/HCl`), which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂). However, at this point in the sequence, no amine has been formed.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option B is chemically nonsensical.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   This sequence fails at **step (iii)**. After forming aniline in steps (i) and (ii), it attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. This reaction does not work on aniline because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option D is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    *   This is the only sequence that does not contain a chemically impossible step. Let's trace the pathway:\n        1.  **i) Alkylation:** Benzene is converted to **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n        2.  **ii) Nitration:** tert-butylbenzene is nitrated. This gives a mixture of *ortho* and *para* isomers. To reach the target, one must proceed with the minor *ortho* isomer. This step contradicts the \"high-yield\" condition but is chemically possible.\n        3.  **iii) Reduction:** The nitro group is reduced to an amine, forming **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Valid)\n        4.  **iv) Nitration:** This is a key step. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 3, forming **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. (Valid and regioselective)\n        5.  **v) Diazotization:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt. (Valid)\n        6.  **vi) Hydrolysis:** The diazonium salt is converted to a phenol, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. (Valid)\n        7.  **vii) Williamson Ether Synthesis:** The phenol is converted to the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Valid)\n    *   The final two steps (viii, ix) are superfluous but do not invalidate the core synthesis.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBy systematically analyzing each option, we find that options A, B, and D contain fatal chemical flaws—reactions that are impossible or nonsensical as written. Option C is the only sequence where every transformation is a valid, known chemical reaction that leads to the correctly named product. Although the initial nitration step is not high-yield, the overall sequence is the only chemically plausible pathway among the choices. Therefore, it must be the intended answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Question and Target Molecule\n\n*   **Task**: Find the sequence for the **high-yield** synthesis of **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Starting Material**: Benzene.\n*   **Target Molecule Structure**: A benzene ring with three adjacent (vicinal) substituents:\n    *   C1: -OEt (ethoxy), a strong activator and ortho/para-director.\n    *   C2: -tBu (tert-butyl), a weak activator and ortho/para-director. It is very bulky, which sterically hinders substitution at the adjacent ortho positions.\n    *   C3: -NO₂ (nitro), a strong deactivator and meta-director.\n*   **Key Challenge**: The question contains two potentially conflicting constraints: the synthesis must be \"high-yield,\" and it must produce the specific 1,2,3-substituted product. Synthesizing a product with a substituent ortho to a bulky tert-butyl group is typically a low-yield process.\n\n### 2. Analyze Each Option for Chemical Feasibility\n\nWe must evaluate each sequence as written in the problem description. A single chemically impossible step invalidates the entire option.\n\n*   **Option A**: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    *   This option is written unclearly, but the key flaw is step `iv) NaNO2/HCl`. This reagent is for diazotization, which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) as the substrate. The product from the preceding steps is a sulfonated nitro-tert-butylbenzene, not an amine.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Option A is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option C**: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    *   This sequence forms a diazonium salt in step (v). Step (vi) then attempts to nitrate this highly unstable intermediate. Nitrating a diazonium salt is not a standard or viable reaction; the salt would decompose under the harsh nitrating conditions.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Option C is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option D**: `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   This sequence correctly forms aniline in steps (i) and (ii). However, step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Option D is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option B**: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    *   This is the only option that does not contain a chemically impossible step. Let's trace the pathway:\n        1.  `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → **tert-butylbenzene**. (Valid)\n        2.  `ii) HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of the *ortho* and *para* isomers.\n        3.  `iii) Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group to an amine.\n        4.  `iv) HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of the resulting aniline derivative.\n        5.  `v) NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of the amino group.\n        6.  `vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat`: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol.\n        7.  `vii) NaOH/EtBr`: Williamson ether synthesis to form the final ether.\n    *   **Analysis of the Ambiguity**: This sequence of reactions is entirely plausible. The conflict arises in step (ii). To get the **named product**, we must use the minor *ortho* isomer from this step, which makes the overall synthesis **low-yield**. To satisfy the **\"high-yield\"** condition, we would use the major *para* isomer, but this would lead to the wrong final product (an isomer).\n\n### 3. Final Conclusion\n\n*   Options A, C, and D are definitively incorrect because they contain chemically impossible reactions.\n*   Option B is the only sequence that describes a chemically plausible series of transformations.\n*   Although Option B cannot simultaneously satisfy the \"high-yield\" condition and produce the named product, it is the only viable choice. In such multiple-choice questions, a sequence that is merely inefficient is a better answer than sequences that are impossible. The most reasonable conclusion is that the \"high-yield\" descriptor in the question is inaccurate, and Option B represents the only possible pathway to the target molecule among the choices.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, a rigorous step-by-step analysis of each option is necessary.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Product Name:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Structure:** The molecule has a benzene ring with three adjacent (vicinal) substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1, a bulky tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2, and a nitro group (-NO₂) at position 3.\n*   **Synthetic Challenges:**\n    *   **Steric Hindrance:** The 1,2,3-substitution pattern is sterically crowded. Introducing a group ortho to the very large tert-butyl group is difficult. Standard electrophilic substitution on tert-butylbenzene heavily favors the para position.\n    *   **Directing Effects:** The synthesis must correctly navigate the activating/deactivating and ortho,para/meta directing effects of the substituents at each stage.\n    *   **\"High-Yield\" Constraint:** The question specifies a \"high-yield\" synthesis, meaning any pathway relying on the separation of a minor isomer is likely incorrect.\n\n### **2. Systematic Evaluation of Each Option**\n\nWe will evaluate each option as written in the prompt for chemical feasibility. A single impossible step invalidates the entire sequence.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   This sequence begins by forming aniline (steps i and ii). Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction is not feasible because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option A is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    *   This sequence forms a diazonium salt in step (v). Step (vi) then attempts to nitrate this highly reactive and unstable diazonium salt. This is not a standard or viable synthetic transformation; the diazonium salt would likely decompose under the harsh nitrating conditions.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option B is chemically impossible.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    *   Step (iv) attempts a diazotization reaction (`NaNO2/HCl`). This reaction requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) as the starting material. The substrate produced after step (iii) is a sulfonated nitro-tert-butylbenzene, which is not an amine.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option C is chemically impossible.\n\n### **3. Detailed Analysis of the Remaining Option**\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\n    *   This is the only sequence that does not contain a fundamentally impossible step. Let's trace the pathway to see if it can lead to the target molecule.\n    1.  **Step i:** Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts alkylation to form **tert-butylbenzene**. This is a standard reaction.\n    2.  **Step ii:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This gives a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. To reach the final product, the synthesis must proceed with the **minor ortho isomer**. This step is chemically possible but violates the \"high-yield\" condition.\n    3.  **Step iii:** The nitro group of the ortho isomer is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**. This is a standard reduction.\n    4.  **Step iv:** Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The tert-butyl group at C2 is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 3, forming the required **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n    5.  **Step v:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt using `NaNO2/HCl`.\n    6.  **Step vi:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol with aqueous acid and heat, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    7.  **Step vii:** A Williamson ether synthesis is performed. The phenol is treated with base (`NaOH`) and an ethyl halide (`EtBr`) to form the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nOptions A, B, and C are fundamentally flawed because they contain chemically impossible reaction steps. By elimination, Option D is the only plausible choice. Although its first nitration step would give a low yield of the required isomer (conflicting with the \"high-yield\" claim in the prompt), the sequence of reactions itself is chemically sound and is the only one that can lead to the named target molecule. In the context of a multiple-choice question, a chemically possible but inefficient route is the correct answer over routes that are chemically impossible.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Deconstruction of the Question\n*   **Starting Material:** Benzene\n*   **Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Key Condition:** The synthesis must be \"high-yield\".\n\n### 2. Analysis of the Target Molecule's Structure\nThe target molecule is a benzene ring with three adjacent (vicinal) substituents:\n*   **Position 1:** Ethoxy group (-OEt), a strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   **Position 2:** tert-Butyl group (-tBu), a weakly activating, ortho, para-director. Its large size creates significant steric hindrance.\n*   **Position 3:** Nitro group (-NO₂), a strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\nThe primary synthetic challenge is introducing a substituent at position 3, which is *ortho* to the very bulky tert-butyl group at position 2. Standard electrophilic aromatic substitution on tert-butylbenzene strongly favors substitution at the *para* position, making an ortho-substituted product a minor component. This directly conflicts with the \"high-yield\" requirement.\n\n### 3. Evaluation of the Synthetic Pathways Presented by the Candidates\nThe candidate answers identify several proposed reaction sequences. We can categorize them into three groups: chemically impossible pathways, a high-yield pathway to the wrong product, and a low-yield pathway to the correct product.\n\n*   **Chemically Impossible Pathways:** Multiple candidates correctly identify that some of the proposed options contain fundamentally flawed chemical steps. These include:\n    *   **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation on Aniline:** This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring.\n    *   **Nitration of a Diazonium Salt:** Diazonium salts are highly unstable intermediates used for replacement reactions, not as substrates for nitration.\n    *   **Incorrect Reaction Order:** Attempting a reaction like diazotization before the necessary functional group (a primary amine) has been created.\n    *   Any option containing such a step is definitively incorrect.\n\n*   **Plausible Pathway to an Isomer (High-Yield):** Several candidates analyze a pathway that is chemically sound and high-yield, but produces an isomer of the target.\n    1.  Alkylation of benzene to form tert-butylbenzene.\n    2.  Nitration, proceeding with the **major para-isomer**.\n    3.  Reduction of the nitro group to an amine.\n    4.  A second nitration, which is regioselective.\n    5.  Conversion of the amine to an ethoxy group via diazotization, hydrolysis, and etherification.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This pathway is high-yield but produces **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**, not the requested product. Therefore, it is an incorrect answer to the question asked.\n\n*   **Plausible Pathway to the Correct Product (Low-Yield):** The most commonly identified viable pathway is the following:\n    1.  **Alkylation:** Benzene is converted to **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    2.  **Nitration:** This step produces a mixture of ortho- and para-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. To proceed, the **minor ortho-isomer** must be separated and used. This step is inherently **not high-yield**.\n    3.  **Reduction:** The ortho-nitro group is reduced to an amine, forming **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n    4.  **Nitration:** In the strongly acidic nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a meta-director. The tert-butyl group is an ortho, para-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to position 3, forming the required **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n    5.  **Diazotization, Hydrolysis, and Etherification:** The amino group is converted to a phenol and then to the final ethoxy ether, yielding **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence is the only one described that produces the correctly named target molecule.\n\n### 4. Final Decision\nWe are faced with a choice between a high-yield synthesis of the wrong molecule and a low-yield synthesis of the correct molecule.\n*   A synthesis that produces an incorrect isomer does not fulfill the primary goal of the question.\n*   A synthesis that produces the correct molecule, but violates the \"high-yield\" condition, is a flawed but direct answer to the question.\n\nIn a multiple-choice scenario, the pathway that leads to the named product must be considered the intended answer, even if it has imperfections. The \"high-yield\" descriptor is most likely an error in the question or a distractor. The sequence that proceeds through the minor ortho-nitro isomer is the only one that results in the correct final product. The majority of candidate answers identify this pathway as Option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, a careful step-by-step analysis of each option is necessary, paying close attention to reaction feasibility, regioselectivity, and directing group effects.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Product:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Structure:** The benzene ring has three adjacent (vicinal) substituents: an ethoxy group (-OEt) at C1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at C2, and a nitro group (-NO₂) at C3.\n*   **Synthetic Challenges:**\n    *   The 1,2,3-substitution pattern is sterically crowded.\n    *   The tert-butyl group is very bulky and sterically hinders substitution at its ortho positions (C2 and C6). Standard electrophilic substitution on tert-butylbenzene strongly favors the para position.\n    *   The question specifies a \"high-yield\" synthesis, which means any pathway relying on the separation of a minor isomer is likely incorrect.\n\n### **2. Systematic Evaluation of Each Option**\n\nWe will evaluate each proposed sequence for chemical feasibility.\n\n*   **Option A: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ...**\n    This sequence begins by forming aniline (steps i and ii). Step (iii) then attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction is not feasible because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents alkylation.\n    **Conclusion: Option A is chemically impossible.**\n\n*   **Option B: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ iv) ; iii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iv) NaNO₂/HCl ...**\n    This sequence is written in a confusing order. However, it attempts a diazotization reaction (step iv, `NaNO₂/HCl`) on the product from the preceding steps. Diazotization requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂) as the starting material. At this point in the sequence, the substrate is a sulfonated nitro-tert-butylbenzene, not an amine.\n    **Conclusion: Option B is chemically impossible.**\n\n*   **Option C: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) SO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ... v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...**\n    This sequence proceeds to form a diazonium salt in step (v). Step (vi) then attempts to nitrate this highly reactive and unstable diazonium salt. This is not a standard or viable synthetic transformation; diazonium salts are used for replacement reactions, not as substrates for further nitration.\n    **Conclusion: Option C is chemically impossible.**\n\n*   **Option D: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; v) NaNO₂/HCl ; vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...**\n    This is the only sequence that does not contain a chemically impossible step. Let's trace the pathway:\n    1.  **i) Friedel-Crafts Alkylation:** Benzene is converted to **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    2.  **ii) Nitration:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene gives a mixture of ortho- and para-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. To reach the target molecule, the synthesis must proceed with the **ortho isomer**, which is the minor product due to steric hindrance. This step contradicts the \"high-yield\" condition of the prompt.\n    3.  **iii) Reduction:** The nitro group of the ortho isomer is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n    4.  **iv) Nitration:** In the strong acid of the nitrating mixture, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a meta-director. The tert-butyl group at C2 is an ortho, para-director. Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 3, forming **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n    5.  **v) Diazotization:** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt.\n    6.  **vi) Hydrolysis:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    7.  **vii) Williamson Ether Synthesis:** The phenol is converted to the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nOptions A, B, and C are fundamentally flawed as they contain chemically impossible reaction steps. Option D is the only sequence that is chemically plausible from start to finish and leads to the correctly named target molecule.\n\nThe primary issue with Option D is that the second step (nitration of tert-butylbenzene) is not high-yield for the required ortho isomer. However, in the context of a multiple-choice question, a chemically possible but inefficient pathway is the only correct choice when all other options are chemically impossible. The flaw lies in the question's \"high-yield\" premise, not in the chemical logic of sequence D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
