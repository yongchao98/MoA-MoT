The discrepancies in the final letter choices appear to stem from inconsistent listings of the multiple-choice options, not from errors in the core logic.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physical Principle**: The decay of a single atomic nucleus is a random process governed by exponential decay. The most crucial characteristic of this process is that it is **memoryless**. This means the probability of the atom decaying in any future time interval is completely independent of its past history.\n\n2.  **Apply the Memoryless Property**: Because the process is memoryless, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant information for calculating its future decay probability. The atom does not \"age\" or become \"more likely\" to decay. Therefore, the problem simplifies to: \"What is the probability that a new atom of this type will decay within 150 minutes?\"\n\n3.  **Set up the Mathematical Model**:\n    *   The probability that an atom *survives* (does not decay) for a time `t` is given by the survival function: `S(t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant.\n    *   The probability that an atom *decays* within a time `t` is the complement of survival: `P(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n4.  **Use the Given Information**: We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    *   `P(100) = 1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`.\n    *   From this, we can determine the probability of *survival* for 100 minutes: `S(100) = e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Required Probability**: We need to find the probability of decay within a 150-minute interval, which is `P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`.\n    *   We can find the survival probability for 150 minutes, `S(150) = e^(-λ * 150)`, without explicitly solving for `λ`. Using the properties of exponents:\n        `e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n    *   Now, substitute the value we found in the previous step:\n        `S(150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n6.  **Perform the Final Calculation**:\n    *   First, calculate the survival probability for 150 minutes: `S(150) = (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607`.\n    *   The probability of decay within 150 minutes is therefore: `P(150) = 1 - S(150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`.\n\n7.  **Conclusion**: The calculated probability is 0.4393, which is 43.93%. This value is closest to the given option of 44%.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **The Memoryless Property**: This is the most critical concept. The information that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes is extraneous and designed to test the understanding of this principle. Any calculation that incorporates the 50 minutes would be incorrect.\n*   **Decay vs. Survival Probability**: It is essential to distinguish between the probability of decay `P(t)` and the probability of survival `S(t)`. The exponential formula `e^(-λt)` directly gives the survival probability, which is the value (0.68) that must be used as the base for the exponentiation.\n*   **Efficient Calculation with Exponent Rules**: The most elegant and error-resistant method is to manipulate the exponents (`S(150) = S(100)^1.5`) rather than explicitly calculating the decay constant `λ` with logarithms, which can introduce intermediate rounding errors.\n*   **Matching Calculation to Options**: After calculating the numerical answer (~43.93%), it must be correctly matched to the closest option provided in the question. In this case, 43.93% is closest to 44%.\n\nBased on the provided options in the prompt (A) 48%, B) 44%, C) 52%, D) 40%), the correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided answers and the fundamental principles of physics, here is a definitive step-by-step solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physical Principle**: The problem concerns the radioactive decay of a single atom. This process is governed by quantum mechanics and is fundamentally probabilistic. The most crucial characteristic for this problem is that the decay process is **memoryless**.\n\n2.  **Apply the Memoryless Property**: The memoryless property means that the probability of an atom decaying in any future time interval is independent of its past history.

Therefore, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes is extraneous information and is irrelevant to the calculation of its future decay probability.\n\n3.  **Reframe the Question**: Due to the memoryless property, the question simplifies from \"Given that the atom has survived for 50 minutes, what is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?\" to the more direct question: \"What is the probability that a new atom of this type will decay within a 150-minute interval?\"\n\n4.  **Set up the Mathematical Model**:\n    *   The probability that an atom *survives* (does not decay) for a time `t` is given by the survival function: `S(t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant specific to this type of atom.\n    *   The probability that an atom *decays* within a time `t` is the complement of survival: `P(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n5.  **Use the Given Information to Characterize the Atom**:\n    *   We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, so `P(100) = 0.32`.\n    *   From this, we can determine the probability of *survival* for 100 minutes: `S(100) = 1 - P(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`.\n    *   This gives us a key value for our calculation: `e^(-100λ) = 0.68`.

This is a random process governed by the laws of quantum mechanics and statistics. The most important characteristic of this process is that it is **memoryless**.\n\n2.  **Apply the Memoryless Property**: The memoryless property means that the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is completely independent of its past history. The atom does not \"age\" or become more likely to decay simply because it has survived for a certain period. Therefore, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes is extraneous information and is irrelevant to the calculation of its future decay probability.\n\n3.  **Simplify the Question**: Due to the memoryless property, the question simplifies to: \"What is the probability that a new atom of this type will decay within 150 minutes?\"\n\n4.  **Set up the Mathematical Model**:\n    *   The probability that an atom *survives* (does not decay) for a time `t` is given by the survival function: `S(t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant.\n    *   The probability that an atom *decays* within a time `t` is the complement of survival: `P(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n5.  **Use the Given Information to Characterize the Atom**:\n    *   We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    *   So, `P(100) = 1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`.\n    *   From this, we can determine the probability of *survival* for 100 minutes: `S(100) = e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`. This gives us a key value for our calculation without needing to find `λ` explicitly.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Required Probability**:\n    *   We need to find the probability of decay within a 150-minute interval, which is `P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`.\n    *   We can relate the survival probability for 150 minutes, `S(150) = e^(-λ * 150)`, to the known survival probability for 100 minutes by using the properties of exponents:\n    *   `e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`.\n    *   Now, substitute the value we found in the previous step: `S(150) = (0.68)^1.5`.\n\n7.  **Perform the Final Calculation**:\n    *   First, calculate the survival probability for 150 minutes: `S(150) = (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607`.\n    *   The probability of decay within 150 minutes is therefore: `P(150) = 1 - S(150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`.\n\n8.  **Compare with Options**:\n    *   The calculated probability is 0.4393, which is 43.93%.\n    *   Rounding this to the nearest percentage point gives 44%.\n    *   Comparing this to the given options:\n        A) 40%\n        B) 48%\n        C) 44%\n        D) 52%\n    *   The calculated value of 44% matches option C.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **The Memoryless Property**: This is the most critical concept. The information that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes is extraneous and designed to test the understanding of this principle. Any calculation that uses the 50-minute value would be incorrect.\n*   **Decay vs. Survival Probability**: It is essential to distinguish between the probability of decay `P(t)` and the probability of survival `S(t)`. The exponential formula `e^(-λt)` directly gives the survival probability. The given information (32% decay) must first be converted to a survival probability (68%) before being used in the formula.\n*   **Exponent Manipulation**: The most efficient and elegant way to solve the problem is to manipulate the exponents, as shown in Step 6 (`S(150) = S(100)^1.5`). This avoids the intermediate step of explicitly calculating the decay constant `λ` using logarithms, which simplifies the calculation and reduces the chance of rounding errors.\n*   **Final Answer Selection**: After performing the calculation correctly to get ~43.93%, it is crucial to carefully compare this result to the given options to select the closest one, which is 44%.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis problem requires understanding the nature of radioactive decay, which is a process governed by an exponential probability distribution.

This avoids the intermediate step of explicitly calculating the decay constant `λ` using logarithms, which simplifies the calculation and reduces the chance of rounding errors.\n*   **Matching Calculation to Options**: After calculating the numerical answer (~43.93%), it must be correctly matched to the closest option provided in the question. In this case, 43.93% is closest to 44%, which corresponds to option B. The inconsistency in the candidate answers' final letter choices highlights the importance of this final step.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
