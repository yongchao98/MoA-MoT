    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the clues to identify the substances.**\n    *   **Substance B and the heavy isotope:** The clue states that B has a melting point \"very close to 277 K\".\n        *   277 K is equivalent to 4 °C.\n        *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 273.15 K (0 °C).\n        *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D), is 276.97 K (3.82 °C).\n        *   This is a very strong match. Therefore, substance B is heavy water (D₂O), and the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned in the problem is **Deuterium (D)**.\n\n    *   **Gas W:** The problem states that gas W is released, and its molecule \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons\".\n        *   Let's analyze deuterium gas, D₂. A single deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n        *   Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n        *   Since the number of protons (2) equals the number of neutrons (2), **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n    *   **The Reaction:** We are told \"Substance X ... reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W\". We've identified W as D₂. A violent reaction that produces deuterium gas and involves deuterated compounds strongly suggests the reaction of a powerful deuteride reagent with heavy water.\n        *   Let's assume **Liquid Y is D₂O**.\n        *   The reaction produces a **precipitate G**.\n        *   When G is heated, it releases **B (D₂O)**. This is consistent with the thermal decomposition of a metal deuteroxide (formed in the reaction) into a metal oxide and heavy water. For example: `M(OD)n -> Metal_Oxide + D₂O`.\n\n    *   **Substance X:** We have several clues for X:\n        *   It contains the heavier isotope, Deuterium (D).\n        *   Its \"very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\". This points to a common laboratory reagent where a hydrogen atom is replaced by deuterium.\n        *   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n        *   It reacts violently with D₂O to produce D₂, and a precipitate G, which we suspect is a metal deuteroxide. A very well-known reaction involves lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog is **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n        *   Let's check if LiAlD₄ fits all clues:\n            *   **Reaction:** LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂. This reaction is famously violent.\n            *   **Gas W:** It produces D₂, which we identified as W.\n            *   **Precipitate G:** Al(OH)₃ is a known precipitate (insoluble gelatinous solid). Therefore, Al(OD)₃ would also be a precipitate. G = Al(OD)₃.\n            *   **Heating G:** 2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This reaction releases D₂O, which we identified as B.\n            *   **Organic Chemistry:** LiAlH₄ is a powerful reducing agent, and so is LiAlD₄. A keto acid (R-CO-COOH) has two reducible groups: a ketone (C=O) and a carboxylic acid (COOH). LiAlH₄/LiAlD₄ reduces both. The ketone is reduced to a secondary alcohol (-CD(OH)-), and the carboxylic acid is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CD₂OH). The final product, a diol, `R-CD(OH)-CD₂OH`, contains two oxygen atoms.\n        *   All clues point conclusively to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n2.  **Perform the final calculation.**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\". The formula for substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements in the compound are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in its isotope form, Deuterium, D).\n    *   We will use the integer mass numbers for the isotopes, as suggested by the integer answers:\n        *   Mass of Deuterium (D) = 2\n        *   Mass of Lithium (Li) = 7 (for the most common isotope, ⁷Li)\n        *   Mass of Aluminum (Al) = 27 (for its only stable isotope, ²⁷Al)\n    *   Comparing these masses, the lightest element is Deuterium (mass 2) and the heaviest element is Aluminum (mass 27).\n    *   The problem states \"...considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\" This means we need to sum the masses of all atoms of the lightest element type and all atoms of the heaviest element type in the molecule.\n    *   **Mass of the heaviest element (Al):** There is one atom of Al in LiAlD₄. Its mass is 27.\n    *   **Mass of the lightest element (D):** There are four atoms of D in LiAlD₄. The cumulative mass is 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Total Sum:** The sum of these cumulative masses is 27 + 8 = 35.\n\n3.  **Conclusion.**\n    The cumulative atomic mass is 35. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
