    "This problem requires the application of the relativistic velocity addition formula.\n\nHere is the reasoning process:\n\n1.  **Define the frames of reference.**\n    *   Let the laboratory frame be the stationary frame, `S`. The observer is at rest in this frame.\n    *   Let the frame of the moving glass be the moving frame, `S'`. The glass is at rest in this frame.\n\n2.  **Identify the known velocities.**\n    *   The velocity of the moving frame `S'` (the glass) relative to the stationary frame `S` (the lab) is `v`. The problem states the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam.\n    *   The speed of light inside the glass, as measured by an observer in the glass's own rest frame (`S'`), is `u'`. The index of refraction `n` is defined as `n = c / u'`, where `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum. Therefore, `u' = c/n`.\n    *   The problem specifies to take `c = 1`. So, the speed of light in the rest frame of the glass is `u' = 1/n`.\n\n3.  **Apply the relativistic velocity addition formula.**\n    The formula for adding velocities that are in the same direction in special relativity is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'v / c^2)`\n    where:\n    *   `u` is the velocity of the object (the light beam) as seen by the observer in the stationary frame `S`. This is the value we want to find.\n    *   `u'` is the velocity of the object (the light beam) in the moving frame `S'`.\n    *   `v` is the velocity of the moving frame `S'` relative to the stationary frame `S`.\n    *   `c` is the speed of light in vacuum.\n\n4.  **Substitute the known values into the formula.**\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v`\n    *   `c = 1`\n\n    Substituting these into the formula gives:\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n) * v / 1^2 )`\n    `u = ( 1/n + v ) / ( 1 + v/n )`\n\n5.  **Simplify the expression.**\n    To eliminate the fractions within the numerator and denominator, we can multiply the entire fraction's top and bottom by `n`:\n    `u = n * ( 1/n + v ) / n * ( 1 + v/n )`\n    `u = ( n * (1/n) + n * v ) / ( n * 1 + n * (v/n) )`\n    `u = ( 1 + n*v ) / ( n + v )`\n\n6.  **Compare with the given options.**\n    The calculated speed of the light beam relative to the observer in the laboratory is `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`.\n    This matches option D.\n\n*   A) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n*   B) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\n*   C) 1\n*   D) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
