    "This problem involves calculating the energies of a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n**1. Single-Particle States:**\n\n*   **System:** Four identical spin-1/2 particles. Being spin-1/2 particles, they are fermions. Fermions obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n*   **Potential Well:** A 1D infinite potential well of length L.\n*   **Single-Particle Energy Levels:** The energy for a single particle in the n-th level is given by:\n    $E_n = n^2 * \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\n    where n = 1, 2, 3, ... is the principal quantum number.\n*   **Energy Unit:** The problem defines the base energy unit as $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\n    Therefore, the energy of the n-th level is $E_n = n^2E$.\n    *   $E_1 = 1^2 E = E$\n    *   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n    *   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n    *   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n    *   ... and so on.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** For fermions, no two particles can occupy the exact same quantum state. A state is defined by its spatial quantum number (n) and its spin quantum number (ms). Since the particles are spin-1/2, they have two possible spin states: spin-up ($m_s = +1/2$) and spin-down ($m_s = -1/2$). This means that each energy level 'n' can accommodate a maximum of two particles (one with spin-up, one with spin-down).\n\n**2. Calculating the Total Energy of the System**\n\nThe total energy of the four-particle system is the sum of the energies of the individual particles. To find the energies of the ground state and excited states, we must arrange the four particles in the available single-particle energy levels according to the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n**Ground State Energy ($E_{GS}$):**\n\nTo achieve the ground state (lowest total energy), we fill the energy levels from the bottom up.\n\n*   **Level n=1 (Energy E):** We can place two particles here (one spin-up, one spin-down). Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times E = 2E$.\n*   **Level n=2 (Energy 4E):** We have two more particles to place. We put them in the next lowest available level, n=2. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum of these energies:\n$E_{GS} = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) = 2E + 8E = 10E$.\n\n**First Excited State Energy ($E_{1st}$):**\n\nTo find the first excited state, we take the ground state configuration and promote one particle to the lowest possible unoccupied energy level. The highest occupied level in the ground state is n=2, and the lowest unoccupied level is n=3.\n\n*   We move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n*   The new configuration is:\n    *   **Level n=1:** Two particles. Energy = $2 \\times E_1 = 2E$.\n    *   **Level n=2:** One particle. Energy = $1 \\times E_2 = 4E$.\n    *   **Level n=3:** One particle. Energy = $1 \\times E_3 = 9E$.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\n$E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$.\n\n**Second Excited State Energy ($E_{2nd}$):**\n\nTo find the second excited state, we need to find the next possible energy configuration that is higher than the first excited state. We consider all possible single-particle promotions from the ground state that would result in a higher energy than the first excited state.\n\nLet's examine the lowest-energy excitations from the ground state configuration (2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=2):\n\n*   **Possibility 1 (already found):** Promote a particle from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3.\n    *   Energy: $2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$. (This is the first excited state).\n\n*   **Possibility 2:** Promote a particle from n=1 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3.\n    *   Energy: $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n\n*   **Possibility 3:** Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: 2 in n=1, 2 in n=3.\n    *   Energy: $(2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_3) = 2E + 18E = 20E$.\n\n*   **Possibility 4:** Promote a particle from n=2 to n=4.\n    *   Configuration: 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4.\n    *   Energy: $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_4) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n\nComparing the energies of these excited configurations (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E,...), we can order them:\n*   Ground State Energy = 10E\n*   First Excited State Energy = 15E\n*   Second Excited State Energy = 18E\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are 10E, 15E, and 18E, respectively. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
