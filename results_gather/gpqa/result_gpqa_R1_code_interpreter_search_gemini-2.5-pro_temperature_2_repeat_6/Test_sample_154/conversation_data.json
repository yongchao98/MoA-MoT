    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation for the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$.\n\n**1. Understand the goal:**\nThe objective is to calculate the uncertainty in the measurement of the observable $P_z$, which is given by the formula:\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}$\n\nwhere:\n*   $\\langle P_z \\rangle$ is the expectation value of the operator $P_z$.\n*   $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$ is the expectation value of the operator $P_z^2$.\n\n**2. Define the given matrices and the state vector:**\nFrom the problem statement, we have:\nThe operator $P_z$ is:\n$P_z = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe state of the system, $|\\psi\\rangle$, is given by the column vector:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe corresponding bra-vector, $\\langle\\psi|$, is the conjugate transpose of $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$\\langle\\psi| = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**3. Calculate the expectation value $\\langle P_z \\rangle$:**\nThe expectation value is calculated as $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|P_z|\\psi\\rangle$.\nFirst, let's compute the action of $P_z$ on $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$P_z|\\psi\\rangle = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} (1)(-1/2) + (0)(1/\\sqrt{2}) + (0)(-1/2) \\\\ (0)(-1/2) + (0)(1/\\sqrt{2}) + (0)(-1/2) \\\\ (0)(-1/2) + (0)(1/\\sqrt{2}) + (-1)(-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow, multiply by $\\langle\\psi|$ from the left:\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\hbar \\left( (-1/2)(-1/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(1/2) \\right)$\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\hbar \\left( 1/4 + 0 - 1/4 \\right) = 0$\nSo, $\\langle P_z \\rangle^2 = 0$.\n\n**4. Calculate the expectation value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$:**\nThe expectation value is calculated as $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|P_z^2|\\psi\\rangle$.\nFirst, we need to find the matrix for the operator $P_z^2$:\n$P_z^2 = \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0^2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & (-1)^2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNext, let's compute the action of $P_z^2$ on $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$P_z^2|\\psi\\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} (1)(-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ (1)(-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow, multiply by $\\langle\\psi|$ from the left:\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\left( (-1/2)(-1/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(-1/2) \\right)$\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\left( 1/4 + 0 + 1/4 \\right) = \\hbar^2 (1/2) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$\n\n**5. Calculate the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$:**\nNow we can plug the values we found into the uncertainty formula:\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - 0} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}}$\n$\\Delta P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\nThe uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$ is $\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}$. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
