    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n**1. Analysis of the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the molecule with the most abundant isotope of each element.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 is two mass units heavier. Its relative abundance is 32% compared to the M+ peak (100%). This M:M+2 ratio of approximately 100:32 (or roughly 3:1) is a definitive isotopic signature for the presence of **one chlorine (Cl) atom** in the molecule. Chlorine has two common isotopes, ³⁵Cl (~75%) and ³⁷Cl (~25%), which leads to this pattern.\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the C₇H₅³⁵ClO₂ isotopologue) and contains one chlorine atom. All four options (A, B, C, and D) have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂ and thus have a molecular weight of 156. Therefore, the MS data is consistent with all four options.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H bond stretch in a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The extensive hydrogen bonding in carboxylic acid dimers causes this significant broadening.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This peak is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) double bond stretch. Specifically, C=O stretches for aromatic carboxylic acids appear around 1710-1680 cm⁻¹. This peak, in combination with the broad O-H stretch, provides very strong evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. This allows us to eliminate:\n    *   B) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (has an aldehyde and a phenol, but not a carboxylic acid).\n    *   C) Phenyl chloroformate (The C=O stretch for a chloroformate is at a much higher frequency, ~1775 cm⁻¹, and it lacks an O-H group).\n*   We are now left with options A (2-chlorobenzoic acid) and D (4-chlorobenzoic acid), as both are carboxylic acids.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Data:**\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (δ > 10 ppm) is characteristic of a **carboxylic acid proton**. The signal is a singlet (s) because this proton is not adjacent to any other protons to couple with. The integration of 1H confirms it is a single proton. This reinforces the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **Aromatic Region:** The key to distinguishing between options A and D lies in the pattern of the aromatic protons (protons attached to the benzene ring).\n    *   We see a doublet at **8.02 ppm (2H)** and another doublet at **7.72 ppm (2H)**.\n    *   This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The symmetry of a para-substituted ring makes the two protons adjacent to one substituent chemically equivalent, and the two protons adjacent to the other substituent are also chemically equivalent. This gives only two signals for the four aromatic protons.\n*   **Evaluating the remaining options:**\n    *   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an ortho-substituted ring. It has no plane of symmetry, meaning all four aromatic protons are chemically different. This would result in a much more complex spectrum with four separate signals (likely multiplets), not a simple pair of doublets.\n    *   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a para-substituted ring. It has a plane of symmetry, leading to two sets of equivalent protons, which perfectly explains the observed pattern of two doublets for 2H each. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group are more deshielded and correspond to the 8.02 ppm signal, while the protons ortho to the chlorine atom correspond to the 7.72 ppm signal.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nAll pieces of spectral data point unambiguously to **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
