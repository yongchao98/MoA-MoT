    "This problem requires a multi-step approach involving stoichiometry and equilibrium considerations.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ to be dissolved.**\nFirst, we need to determine the molar mass of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃.\nMolar Mass (Fe(OH)₃) = M(Fe) + 3 × (M(O) + M(H))\nUsing the molar masses: Fe ≈ 55.845 g/mol, O ≈ 16.00 g/mol, H ≈ 1.01 g/mol.\nMolar Mass (Fe(OH)₃) = 55.845 + 3 × (16.00 + 1.01) = 106.875 g/mol.\n\nNow, we calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ in the 0.1 g sample:\nMoles = Mass / Molar Mass\nMoles Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.875 g/mol ≈ 9.3567 × 10⁻⁴ mol.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the stoichiometric amount of acid needed.**\nThe dissolution of Fe(OH)₃ by a strong acid (represented by H⁺) is a neutralization reaction:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nAccording to the stoichiometry, 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ reacts with 3 moles of H⁺ ions.\nTherefore, the moles of H⁺ required stoichiometrically are:\nMoles H⁺ (stoichiometric) = 3 × Moles Fe(OH)₃\nMoles H⁺ (stoichiometric) = 3 × 9.3567 × 10⁻⁴ mol ≈ 2.807 × 10⁻³ mol.\n\n**Step 3: Account for equilibrium to prevent re-precipitation.**\nSimply adding the stoichiometric amount of acid isn't enough. The Fe³⁺ ions produced will establish an equilibrium in the solution. To ensure all 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ remains dissolved, the ion product, Q = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³, must be less than or equal to the solubility product constant, Ksp, for Fe(OH)₃. The Ksp for Fe(OH)₃ at 25°C is approximately 2.79 × 10⁻³⁹.\n\nFirst, let's find the concentration of Fe³⁺ ions if all the solid dissolves in the final 100 cm³ (0.1 L) volume:\n[Fe³⁺] = Moles Fe(OH)₃ / Volume = 9.3567 × 10⁻⁴ mol / 0.1 L ≈ 9.3567 × 10⁻³ M.\n\nNow, we use the Ksp expression to find the maximum allowed concentration of OH⁻ ions in the solution to keep the Fe³⁺ dissolved:\nKsp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³\n2.79 × 10⁻³⁹ = (9.3567 × 10⁻³ M) × [OH⁻]³\n[OH⁻]³ = 2.79 × 10⁻³⁹ / 9.3567 × 10⁻³ ≈ 2.982 × 10⁻³⁷\n[OH⁻] = (2.982 × 10⁻³⁷)¹/³ ≈ 6.68 × 10⁻¹³ M.\n\nThis is the maximum [OH⁻] allowed in the final solution. The excess H⁺ ions added are what maintain this low hydroxide concentration.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total H⁺ required and the volume of acid.**\nThe total moles of H⁺ added must serve two purposes:\n1.  Neutralize the hydroxide from Fe(OH)₃ (the stoichiometric amount).\n2.  Provide the excess H⁺ needed to remain in the final 0.1 L solution to maintain the required acidity.\n\nLet's calculate the required [H⁺] in the final solution from the maximum [OH⁻] using the ion product of water, Kw (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C):\n[H⁺] = Kw / [OH⁻] = 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴ / 6.68 × 10⁻¹³ M ≈ 0.01497 M.\n\nNow, calculate the moles of excess H⁺ needed in the 0.1 L solution:\nMoles H⁺ (excess) = [H⁺] × Volume = 0.01497 M × 0.1 L ≈ 1.497 × 10⁻³ mol.\n\nThe total moles of H⁺ required is the sum of the stoichiometric and excess amounts:\nTotal Moles H⁺ = Moles H⁺ (stoichiometric) + Moles H⁺ (excess)\nTotal Moles H⁺ = 2.807 × 10⁻³ mol + 1.497 × 10⁻³ mol ≈ 4.304 × 10⁻³ mol.\n\nWe are using a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid. The volume needed is:\nVolume = Moles / Molarity\nVolume = 4.304 × 10⁻³ mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.04304 L.\nConverting to cm³ (1 L = 1000 cm³):\nVolume = 0.04304 L × 1000 cm³/L = 43.04 cm³.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the pH of the final solution.**\nThe pH is determined by the concentration of excess H⁺ ions in the final solution.\npH = -log[H⁺]\npH = -log(0.01497) ≈ 1.82.\n\n**Step 6: Review the options.**\nOur calculated values are approximately: **pH 1.82** and **Volume 43.04 cm³**.\nLet's examine the provided options:\nA) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³\nB) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³\nC) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³\nD) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³\n\nNone of the options match our calculation. This suggests that the problem might be based on a different Ksp value or contain an error. Let's re-calculate using the values from option D to see if they are consistent.\n\n**Reverse Calculation using Option D (pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³):**\n1.  **If pH = 2.04**, then [H⁺] = 10⁻²⁰⁴ ≈ 0.00912 M.\n2.  **Moles of excess H⁺** in 0.1 L = 0.00912 M × 0.1 L = 9.12 × 10⁻⁴ mol.\n3.  **Volume of acid added** = 28.05 cm³ = 0.02805 L.\n4.  **Total moles H⁺ added** = 0.1 M × 0.02805 L = 2.805 × 10⁻³ mol.\n5.  **Moles of H⁺ used for neutralization** = Total Moles - Excess Moles\n    = 2.805 × 10⁻³ mol - 9.12 × 10⁻⁴ mol = 1.893 × 10⁻³ mol.\n6.  **Moles of Fe(OH)₃ dissolved** based on this neutralization = (1.893 × 10⁻³ mol H⁺) / 3 ≈ 6.31 × 10⁻⁴ mol Fe(OH)₃.\n7.  **Mass of Fe(OH)₃ dissolved** = 6.31 × 10⁻⁴ mol × 106.875 g/mol ≈ 0.067 g.\n\nThis calculation shows that using the acid volume and pH from option D, only about 0.067 g of Fe(OH)₃ would dissolve, not the required 0.1 g.\n\nThere seems to be an inconsistency in the problem statement or the options provided. However, let's re-examine the simplest interpretation, where only the stoichiometric amount of acid is considered, which is a common simplification.\n\n**Simplified Stoichiometric Calculation:**\n1.  Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 9.3567 × 10⁻⁴ mol.\n2.  Moles H⁺ needed = 3 × 9.3567 × 10⁻⁴ = 2.807 × 10⁻³ mol.\n3.  Volume of 0.1 M acid = 2.807 × 10⁻³ mol / 0.1 M = 0.02807 L = 28.07 cm³.\n\nThis calculated volume (28.07 cm³) is extremely close to the 28.05 cm³ given in option D. It's highly probable that the question intends for this simplified stoichiometric calculation, ignoring the excess acid required to maintain equilibrium. If we accept this volume, the associated pH is 2.04. Although our detailed equilibrium calculation shows this pH is insufficient, in the context of a multiple-choice question with a clear numerical match, this is the most likely intended answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
