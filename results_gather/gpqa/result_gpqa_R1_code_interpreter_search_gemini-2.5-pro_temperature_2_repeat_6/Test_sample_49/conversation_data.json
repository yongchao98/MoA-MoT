    "An L-loop Feynman diagram calculation in D-dimensional spacetime involves integrating over L independent loop momenta. Each loop integral is of the form:\n\n∫ d<sup>D</sup>k / (2π)<sup>D</sup>\n\nWhen we perform such an integral in a typical quantum field theory calculation (for instance, using dimensional regularization), a characteristic factor related to the spacetime dimension appears for each loop.\n\nLet's determine this factor for the specified D=4 spacetime.\n\nThe integral over a single loop momentum `k` in 4-dimensional spacetime is:\n\n∫ d<sup>4</sup>k / (2π)<sup>4</sup>\n\nIn calculations, it's common to perform a Wick rotation to Euclidean space (k<sub>0</sub> → i k<sub>E0</sub>), which changes the momentum-space measure and the signature of the metric. The integral becomes:\n\ni ∫ d<sup>4</sup>k<sub>E</sub> / (2π)<sup>4</sup>\n\nWe can split the 4-dimensional Euclidean integral into an integral over the magnitude of the momentum (k<sub>E</sub>) and an integral over the solid angle in 4D (Ω<sub>4</sub>).\n\nd<sup>4</sup>k<sub>E</sub> = k<sub>E</sub><sup>3</sup> dk<sub>E</sub> dΩ<sub>4</sub>\n\nThe surface area of a unit 4-sphere is ∫dΩ<sub>4</sub> = 2π<sup>2</sup>.\n\nSo, the momentum integral contains the factor:\n\n∫ dΩ<sub>4</sub> / (2π)<sup>4</sup> = 2π<sup>2</sup> / (16π<sup>4</sup>) = 1 / (8π<sup>2</sup>)\n\nHowever, a standard loop integral involves propagators. A typical one-loop integral with two propagators, after introducing Feynman parameters and performing the momentum integral using dimensional regularization in D dimensions, yields a characteristic factor of `1 / (4π)^(D/2)`.\n\nFor D=4 dimensions, this factor is:\n\n1 / (4π)<sup>(4/2)</sup> = 1 / (4π)<sup>2</sup> = 1 / (16π<sup>2</sup>)\n\nThis `1 / (16π²) ` factor is a hallmark of a single loop in a four-dimensional theory. For an L-loop diagram, we expect this factor to be raised to the power of L, as there are L independent loop integrals.\n\nTherefore, an L-loop diagram will have a size estimate proportional to:\n\n(1 / (16π<sup>2</sup>))<sup>L</sup> = (1 / (4π)<sup>2</sup>)<sup>L</sup> = 1 / (4π)<sup>2L</sup>\n\nThe expression on your colleague's note is:\n\n`alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`\n\nWe can isolate the factor that depends on powers of π, which is `1/(4pi)^6`. The other factors (`alpha^3`, `g^2`) relate to the number and type of interaction vertices, the `sqrt(2)` and `8` are numerical factors from symmetries or matrix traces, and `(Q/M)^2` is a ratio of energy scales that comes from the final evaluation of the integral.\n\nBy comparing the general form of the loop suppression factor with the one in the note, we can find the number of loops, L:\n\n1 / (4π)<sup>2L</sup> = 1 / (4π)<sup>6</sup>\n\nFrom this, we can equate the exponents:\n\n2L = 6\nL = 3\n\nThus, the Feynman diagram contained 3 loops. The term `alpha^3 * g^2` suggests that the diagram involves 3 vertices of one interaction type (e.g., electromagnetic) and 2 vertices of another type, which is consistent with a 3-loop diagram topology.\n\n<<<B>>>"
