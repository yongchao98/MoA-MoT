    "Here's a step-by-step derivation to find the eigenvector.\n\n### 1. Define the Operator and the Direction Vector\n\nThe quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$ is given by its components, which are proportional to the Pauli matrices:\n*   $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x$\n*   $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y$\n*   $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z$\n\nThis is the standard spin operator $\\vec{S}$ for a spin-1/2 particle like a muon.\n\nThe direction vector $\\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane. A general unit vector is described in spherical coordinates by $(\\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi, \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi, \\cos\\theta)$. For a vector in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero, which means we can set the azimuthal angle $\\phi=0$.\nSo, the unit vector is:\n$\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$\nHere, $\\theta$ is the angle the vector $\\vec{n}$ makes with the positive z-axis.\n\n### 2. Construct the Operator Along the Direction $\\vec{n}$\n\nThe operator representing the component of $\\vec{P}$ along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is given by the dot product $P_{\\vec{n}} = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$.\n$P_{\\vec{n}} = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n$P_{\\vec{n}} = P_x \\sin\\theta + P_y (0) + P_z \\cos\\theta$\n$P_{\\vec{n}} = (\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x) \\sin\\theta + (\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z) \\cos\\theta$\n\nSubstituting the matrices:\n$P_{\\vec{n}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\right)$\n$P_{\\vec{n}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n$P_{\\vec{n}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n### 3. Set Up the Eigenvalue Problem\n\nWe need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle$ that corresponds to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$. The eigenvalue equation is:\n$P_{\\vec{n}} |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$\n\nLet the eigenvector be represented by the column vector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$.\n$\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nWe can cancel the $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ term from both sides:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThis matrix equation gives a system of two linear equations:\n1.  $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n2.  $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n\n### 4. Solve for the Eigenvector Components\n\nLet's solve the first equation for the ratio $b/a$:\n$b \\sin\\theta = a - a \\cos\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n\nNow, we use the trigonometric half-angle identities:\n*   $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)$\n*   $\\sin\\theta = 2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $b/a$:\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n\nSo, we have the relationship $b = a \\tan(\\theta/2)$. The unnormalized eigenvector is:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ a \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix} = a \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n### 5. Normalize the Eigenvector\n\nFor the eigenvector to represent a physical state, it must be normalized, meaning its norm (length) must be 1. The normalization condition is $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = 1$, which for a 2-component vector is $|a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1$.\n$|a|^2 + |a \\tan(\\theta/2)|^2 = 1$\n$|a|^2 (1 + \\tan^2(\\theta/2)) = 1$\nUsing the identity $1 + \\tan^2(x) = \\sec^2(x)$:\n$|a|^2 \\sec^2(\\theta/2) = 1$\n$|a|^2 = \\frac{1}{\\sec^2(\\theta/2)} = \\cos^2(\\theta/2)$\n$|a| = |\\cos(\\theta/2)|$\n\nWe can choose the simplest phase for $a$, so let $a = \\cos(\\theta/2)$ (assuming $\\cos(\\theta/2)$ is positive, which is valid for the typical range of $\\theta \\in [0, \\pi]$).\nNow we find $b$:\n$b = a \\tan(\\theta/2) = \\cos(\\theta/2) \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\sin(\\theta/2)$\n\nSo, the normalized eigenvector is:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe elements of this eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
