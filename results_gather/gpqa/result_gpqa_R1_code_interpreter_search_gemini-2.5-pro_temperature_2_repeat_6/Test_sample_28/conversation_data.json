    "To solve this problem, we need to determine which mutation is most likely to completely inactivate the gene responsible for producing an anti-nutritional compound. Gene inactivation is most effectively achieved by introducing a mutation that leads to a non-functional or severely truncated protein. Let's analyze the effects of each mutation on the protein's translation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This requires disrupting the function of the gene that synthesizes it. The most definitive way to do this genetically is to introduce a **nonsense mutation** (a premature stop codon) or a **frameshift mutation** early in the gene's coding sequence. These mutations are generally more disruptive than **missense mutations** (which only change a single amino acid).\n\n2.  **Establish the Baseline (Intact Gene):**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...-3’`\n    *   The sequence starts with `ATG`, the universal start codon, which codes for Methionine (Met).\n    *   To understand the mutations, we will translate the DNA sequence into an amino acid sequence using the standard genetic code. The codons (groups of three bases) are read sequentially from the start codon.\n    *   **Translation of Intact Gene:**\n        *   ATG -> Methionine (M)\n        *   TTT -> Phenylalanine (F)\n        *   CTC -> Leucine (L)\n        *   GCT -> Alanine (A)\n        *   GGT -> Glycine (G)\n        *   ... and so on.\n    *   The resulting protein starts: `Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-Gly-...`\n\n3.  **Analyze Each Mutant:** We will compare each mutant sequence to the intact sequence to identify the change and predict its impact.\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:**\n        *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT...-3’`\n        *   Comparison: The `CTC` codon (for Leucine) in the intact gene has been changed to `TAC`.\n        *   **Translation:** `TAC` codes for Tyrosine (Y).\n        *   **Effect:** This is a **missense mutation**. The resulting protein sequence is `Met-Phe-Tyr-Ala-Gly...` instead of `Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-Gly...`. A single amino acid change might alter the protein's function, but it's not guaranteed to eliminate it. The protein could still be partially or fully functional.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:**\n        *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT...-3’`\n        *   Comparison: The `CTC` codon (for Leucine) in the intact gene has been changed to `TAA`.\n        *   **Translation:** `TAA` is one of the three **stop codons** (along with TAG and TGA).\n        *   **Effect:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. When the ribosome encounters this `TAA` codon, it will stop translation. The resulting \"protein\" will be only two amino acids long (`Met-Phe`). A protein this short is almost certain to be completely non-functional. This mutation is therefore very likely to eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:**\n        *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...-3’`\n        *   Comparison: There are two changes. The third codon `CTC` (Leu) is changed to `TAC` (Tyr), and the sixth codon `ACT` (Thr) is changed to `GTC` (Val).\n        *   **Effect:** These are two separate **missense mutations**. While multiple amino acid changes increase the chance of disrupting the protein's function compared to a single change, it is still not as definitive as a premature stop codon. The protein may retain some function.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:**\n        *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...-3’`\n        *   Comparison: This mutation is more complex. Let's align the sequences:\n            *   Intact:  `...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`\n            *   Mutant4: `...TAC GCT --- ACT...`\n            A substitution (`CTC` -> `TAC`) has occurred, followed by a deletion of the three-nucleotide `GGT` codon.\n        *   **Effect:** Since an entire codon (`GGT`) is deleted, the reading frame is maintained. The sequence of codons is simply missing one. This is called an **in-frame deletion**. The resulting protein will be missing the Glycine that `GGT` coded for and will have a Leucine changed to a Tyrosine. While this will alter the protein, it's less disruptive than a frameshift and not as certain to abolish function as a nonsense mutation.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nComparing the potential effects of the four mutations:\n*   Mutant 1 & 3 (Missense): May or may not inactivate the protein.\n*   Mutant 4 (In-frame deletion): Removes an amino acid. Likely to be disruptive, but not guaranteed to knock out function.\n*   **Mutant 2 (Nonsense):** Introduces a premature stop codon right at the beginning of the protein sequence. This will result in a severely truncated and non-functional protein. This is the most reliable way to eliminate the gene's function and, consequently, the production of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nTherefore, Mutant 2 represents the most probable solution to the problem.\n\n<<<B>>>"
