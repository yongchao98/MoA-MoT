    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n### 1. Identify the Reactants and Reaction\n*   **Dicarboxylic acid and anhydride**: The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene, which upon dehydration forms an anhydride. The anhydride's ¹H NMR spectrum has a single peak at 7 ppm, and its ¹³C NMR has two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n    *   A single peak in the ¹H NMR means all protons are chemically equivalent due to symmetry.\n    *   Two peaks in the ¹³C NMR mean there are only two types of carbon atoms.\n    *   A chemical shift of 7 ppm is characteristic of protons on a carbon-carbon double bond (vinyl protons) that are electron-deficient.\n    *   A chemical shift of ~165 ppm is typical for a carbonyl carbon (C=O), and ~137 ppm is typical for an alkene carbon (C=C).\n    *   This information perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**. It is formed from maleic acid (a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid). It has two equivalent vinyl protons and two sets of equivalent carbons (two alkene carbons and two carbonyl carbons).\n*   **Diene**: The other reactant is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene suitable for a Diels-Alder reaction. It has four methyl groups on the conjugated double bond system (C1 to C4) and a CH₂ group at the C5 position.\n*   **Reaction**: The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n\n### 2. Determine the Products and their Stereochemistry\n*   Diels-Alder reactions involving cyclic dienes typically produce two stereoisomeric products: an ***endo*** adduct and an ***exo*** adduct.\n*   The Alder rule states that the *endo* product is usually the major, kinetically-favored product, while the *exo* product is the minor, thermodynamically-favored product (but formed more slowly).\n*   The problem states a major and a minor product are formed. We can assign the **major product as the *endo* isomer** and the **minor product as the *exo* isomer**.\n*   **Structure of the Adducts**: The reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene framework.\n    *   The C5-CH₂ group of the diene becomes the C7 one-carbon bridge of the bicyclic system.\n    *   The original C1/C4 carbons of the diene (with their methyl groups) become the bridgehead carbons.\n    *   The original C2/C3 carbons of the diene (with their methyl groups) form the new double bond in the product.\n    *   The anhydride ring is fused to the remaining two carbons.\n*   **Stereochemical Difference**:\n    *   In the ***endo* adduct (major product)**, the anhydride ring is oriented on the same side as the C7 bridge (*syn* to the bridge), causing it to be \"tucked under\" the C2=C3 double bond.\n    *   In the ***exo* adduct (minor product)**, the anhydride ring is on the opposite side of the C7 bridge (*anti* to the bridge), pointing away from the rest of the bicyclic structure.\n\n### 3. Analyze the NOESY NMR Spectrum\n*   **NOESY**: This 2D NMR technique shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close to each other in space (< 5 Å), regardless of their through-bond connectivity.\n*   **The Differentiating Cross-Peak**: The problem states a cross-peak is present in the major product's spectrum but absent (or weak) in the minor product's spectrum. This means we are looking for a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n*   **Spatial Relationships**:\n    *   Let's identify the key protons in the products:\n        *   **Anhydride protons (H_succinic)**: The two protons on the succinic anhydride ring. By symmetry, they are equivalent. Signal: **2H singlet**. Their chemical environment (alpha to two carbonyl groups) suggests a shift around **~3.5 ppm**.\n        *   **Vinyl methyl groups (Me_vinyl)**: The two equivalent methyl groups on the C2=C3 double bond. Signal: **6H singlet**. Shift **~1.7 ppm**.\n        *   **Bridgehead methyl groups (Me_bridgehead)**: The two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions (C1, C4). Signal: **6H singlet**. Shift **~1.0 ppm**.\n        *   **C7-bridge protons**: The two protons on the C7 bridge. They are diastereotopic (in different chemical environments, one *syn* to the C2=C3 double bond and one *anti*). They will appear as two separate signals, each a **1H doublet** (due to geminal coupling). The *syn* proton is closer to the double bond, and its signal is typically around **~1.5 ppm**.\n    *   **In the *endo* (major) product**: The anhydride ring is tucked under the bicyclic system, placing its protons (H_succinic) very close to the *syn* proton on the C7 bridge.\n    *   **In the *exo* (minor) product**: The anhydride ring points away from the bicyclic system, so its protons are far from all other protons, including the C7-bridge protons.\n*   **Conclusion**: The strong NOE cross-peak observed only for the major (*endo*) product must be between the **anhydride protons (H_succinic)** and the **C7-syn proton**.\n\n### 4. Match Analysis with the Given Options\nLet's match the interacting protons with the NMR data provided in the options:\n*   Interacting protons: **H_succinic** and **C7-syn proton**.\n*   Resonance for H_succinic: **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n*   Resonance for C7-syn proton: **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n*   A) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_vinyl) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_succinic). These protons are far apart in the *endo* isomer.\n*   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (C7-syn). The distance between these protons is fixed by the rigid frame and should be the same in both *endo* and *exo* isomers. An NOE here would not be unique to the major product.\n*   C) **A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (C7-syn) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_succinic).** This matches our analysis perfectly. These protons are close only in the major (*endo*) product.\n*   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_vinyl). The distance is the same in both isomers.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak in the major product connects the resonances of the C7-syn proton and the anhydride protons.\n\n<<<C>>>"
