    "1.  **Analyze the Reactants and the Reaction**\n    *   **Reactant:** Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. \"Racemic\" means it is a 1:1 mixture of the (R)- and (S)-enantiomers of 3-methylpent-1-ene.\n        *   The structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃).\n        *   The chiral center is C3. Let's denote the (R)-enantiomer as **R-alkene** and the (S)-enantiomer as **S-alkene**.\n    *   **Catalyst and Reaction:** Grubbs catalyst performs olefin metathesis. Since only one alkene is present, it will undergo self-metathesis (homodimerization). The general reaction for a terminal alkene R-CH=CH₂ is:\n        2 R'-CH=CH₂  --[Grubbs catalyst]-->  R'-CH=CH-R' + CH₂=CH₂ (ethene)\n    *   The question asks to exclude ethene. The product of interest is R'-CH=CH-R', where R' is the sec-butyl group, -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃).\n    *   The systematic name of the product is **3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene**. This molecule has two chiral centers (C3 and C6) and a C=C double bond (at C4), which can exhibit E/Z stereoisomerism.\n\n2.  **Consider All Possible Dimerization Reactions**\n    Since the starting material is a racemic mixture of **R-alkene** and **S-alkene**, three types of dimerization reactions will occur:\n    *   Reaction 1: **R-alkene** + **R-alkene**  →  (3R, 6R)-dimer\n    *   Reaction 2: **S-alkene** + **S-alkene**  →  (3S, 6S)-dimer\n    *   Reaction 3: **R-alkene** + **S-alkene**  →  (3R, 6S)-dimer (or 3S, 6R, which is the same constitutional isomer)\n\n3.  **Analyze the Stereochemistry of the Products for Each Reaction**\n\n    *   **Products from R-alkene + R-alkene (and S-alkene + S-alkene):**\n        *   The product has the configuration (3R, 6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene.\n        *   This product can exist as two geometric isomers about the C4=C5 double bond: (E) and (Z).\n        *   **(E)-(3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene:** This molecule is chiral.\n        *   **(Z)-(3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene:** This molecule is also chiral.\n        *   Similarly, the reaction of **S-alkene** with itself will produce the enantiomers:\n        *   **(E)-(3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene:** The enantiomer of the (E)-(3R,6R) isomer.\n        *   **(Z)-(3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene:** The enantiomer of the (Z)-(3R,6R) isomer.\n        *   These two reactions produce a total of **4 distinct stereoisomers**, which will exist as two racemic pairs.\n\n    *   **Products from R-alkene + S-alkene (Cross-Dimerization):**\n        *   The product is (3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. We need to analyze the stereochemistry of its E and Z isomers.\n        *   **(E)-(3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene:** In this molecule, the two chiral groups ((R)-sec-butyl and (S)-sec-butyl) are on opposite sides of the double bond. The molecule has a center of inversion (Ci) at the midpoint of the C=C bond. A molecule with a center of inversion is achiral. Therefore, this is a **meso compound**. There is only one such molecule. (Note: (E)-(3R,6S) is identical to (E)-(3S,6R)).\n        *   **(Z)-(3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene:** In this molecule, the two chiral groups are on the same side of the double bond. This structure possesses a plane of symmetry (Cs) that bisects the C=C bond and is perpendicular to it. The reflection of the (R)-sec-butyl group is an (S)-sec-butyl group. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral. Therefore, this is also a **meso compound**. There is only one such molecule.\n\n4.  **Count the Total Number of Unique Products**\n    Let's list all the unique stereoisomers formed:\n    1.  (E)-(3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (chiral)\n    2.  (E)-(3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (enantiomer of 1)\n    3.  (Z)-(3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (chiral)\n    4.  (Z)-(3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (enantiomer of 3)\n    5.  (E)-(3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (meso, achiral)\n    6.  (Z)-(3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (meso, achiral)\n\n    All six of these are distinct stereoisomers. Counting them, we find there are 6 possible products (excluding ethene).\n\n<<<A>>>"
