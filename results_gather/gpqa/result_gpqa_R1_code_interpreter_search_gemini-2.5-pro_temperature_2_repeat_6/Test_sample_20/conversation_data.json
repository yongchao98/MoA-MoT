    "**Part A: Tautomerism Analysis**\n\n1.  **Understanding Tautomerism:** Tautomerism is a form of constitutional isomerism where two structures (tautomers) are in equilibrium and can be interconverted, most commonly by the migration of a proton. The most prevalent type is keto-enol tautomerism, which involves the interconversion of a keto form (containing a C=O group) and an enol form (containing a C=C-OH group). A key requirement for keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of at least one hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon). This hydrogen is called an α-hydrogen.\n\n2.  **Analyzing Benzoquinone:** The structure of p-benzoquinone is a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two carbonyl (C=O) groups at positions 1 and 4. The carbons adjacent (α) to the carbonyl groups are part of carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C). These carbons do not have any hydrogen atoms attached to them. Since there are no α-hydrogens, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyzing Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are CH₂ groups. Each of these carbons is an α-carbon to two adjacent carbonyl groups. The hydrogens on these carbons are highly acidic and can be easily removed. This allows the molecule to readily convert to its enol form. In fact, its enol tautomer, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), is an aromatic compound and is therefore exceptionally stable. The equilibrium heavily favors this aromatic enol form. Thus, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione exhibits tautomerism.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism Analysis**\n\n1.  **Understanding Optical Isomerism:** Optical isomerism is a type of stereoisomerism. It is exhibited by chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature leading to chirality is a chiral center, which is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups or atoms.\n\n2.  **Analyzing Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** Let's examine the structure: CH₃-CH(OH)-C(=O)OCH₃. The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four different groups:\n    *   -H (a hydrogen atom)\n    *   -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n    *   -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n    *   -C(=O)OCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n    Since this carbon is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and will have two non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers). Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyzing Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is CH₃O(C=O)-CH=CH-(C=O)OCH₃. This is a trans isomer around the central double bond. The molecule is planar and has a center of inversion, as well as a plane of symmetry lying in the plane of the molecule. Any molecule possessing a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is achiral and cannot exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Part B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Combination:**\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism): **Benzoquinone**\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism): **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
