    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y using the properties of compound A2.**\n\nThe problem states that compound A1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine (F₂). This means A1 is a higher fluoride of element Y than A2. The mass percentage (ɷF) of fluorine in A2 is given as 31.96%.\n\nLet the formula of A2 be YFₙ.\nThe molar mass of fluorine is M(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol.\nThe mass percentage of fluorine is calculated as:\nɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n\nWe are given ɷF = 0.3196. Let's set up the equation to find the molar mass of Y (M(Y)).\n0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M(Y) + n * 19.00)\n0.3196 * (M(Y) + 19n) = 19n\n0.3196 * M(Y) + 6.0724n = 19n\n0.3196 * M(Y) = 19n - 6.0724n\n0.3196 * M(Y) = 12.9276n\nM(Y) = (12.9276 / 0.3196) * n\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\n\nNow, we test integer values for n (the number of fluorine atoms, representing the oxidation state) to find a plausible atomic mass for element Y.\n\n*   If n = 1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Calcium, but Ca chemistry doesn't fit the problem's description).\n*   If n = 2, M(Y) ≈ 80.90 g/mol (close to Bromine, but BrF₂ is not the formula for a stable binary compound that would be a decomposition product).\n*   If n = 3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (close to Antimony, Sb=121.76, but SbF₃ is white and antimony fluorides are not known to oxidize xenon).\n*   If n = 4, M(Y) ≈ 161.80 g/mol (no element fits well).\n*   If n = 5, M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (very close to **Gold (Au)**, with an atomic mass of 196.97 g/mol).\n*   If n = 6, M(Y) ≈ 242.70 g/mol (close to Americium/Plutonium, but as we'll see, Gold is a much better fit for all clues).\n\nLet's assume Y is Gold (Au). Then n=5, and A2 is **AuF₅**.\nLet's verify the mass percentage for AuF₅:\nM(AuF₅) = 196.97 + 5 * 19.00 = 196.97 + 95 = 291.97 g/mol.\nɷF = (95 / 291.97) * 100% ≈ 32.54%. This is reasonably close to the given 31.96%, with the small discrepancy likely due to rounding in the problem data.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the five binary compounds of Gold and Fluorine.**\n\nNow we verify the other clues based on Y being Gold.\n*   **\"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known.\"**\n    Gold indeed has five known binary fluorides: AuF, Au₃F₅, AuF₃, AuF₅, and the dimeric form of gold(V) fluoride, Au₂F₁₀. These are our compounds A1-A5 in some order.\n*   **A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K and oxidizes xenon.**\n    The dimer **Au₂F₁₀** (also written as (AuF₅)₂) fits this description. It is a powerful oxidizing and fluorinating agent, stronger than AuF₅, and is known to be able to oxidize xenon. It is described as dark red. A1 -> A2 + F2 implies A1 has a higher fluorine content or reactivity than A2. Au₂F₁₀ is a good candidate for A1, and AuF₅ for A2. The low decomposition temperature fits the profile of a highly reactive substance. (Though A1 could also be AuF₅ and A2 be AuF₃). However, identifying A1 precisely is not needed to find A4.\n*   **A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y (Gold).**\n    Fluorination of gold powder with fluorine gas typically produces **AuF₃** or **AuF₅** depending on conditions (temperature and pressure).\n*   **\"A5 can be obtained by adding Y (Au) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4.\"**\n    This describes a comproportionation reaction. We are mixing Au (oxidation state 0) with a gold fluoride A4 (oxidation state +n) to get A5 (oxidation state +m, where 0 < m < n). The 1:1 molar ratio is a key clue for the reaction:\n    Au⁰ + AuⁿFₙ → 2 Au^(n/2)F(n/2) (balanced for Gold).\n    Let's check the possible oxidation states of gold fluorides: +1, +5/3 (+1.67), +3, +5.\n    If A4 is **AuF₃** (Gold(III) fluoride), the reaction would be:\n    Au + AuF₃ → ... The product's oxidation state should be between 0 and +3. **AuF** (Gold(I) fluoride) has a gold oxidation state of +1. The balanced reaction is:\n    2Au + AuF₃ → 3AuF\n    This does not match the 1:1 molar ratio.\n\n    Let's try another possibility for A4. What if A4 is a solution of a complex acid? Hydrofluoric acid (HF) is the solvent in which these reactions are often carried out. Gold fluorides react with HF. Specifically, AuF₃ reacts with HF to form fluoroauric acid, **HAuF₄**.\n    *   HAuF₄ is a strong acid and exists in HF solutions. The solution is colorless, which matches the description \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\".\n    *   Let's test the reaction of Au with HAuF₄ in a 1:1 molar ratio:\n        Au + HAuF₄ → ...\n        Here we mix Au(0) with Au(III). Comproportionation could lead to Au(I). Let's try to form a stable Au(I) complex, which could be our substance A5. A plausible reaction in HF is:\n        Au(s) + HAuF₄(solv) + 2HF(solv) → 2HAuF₂(solv)\n        In this reaction, we mix 1 mole of Au with 1 mole of the Au(III) compound (HAuF₄), matching the 1:1 molar ratio described. The product, HAuF₂, is our substance A5. This compound is known and contains Au(I).\n    *   **\"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\"** A5 is HAuF₂. Au(I) compounds are prone to disproportionation in water. A likely reaction is:\n        3HAuF₂(aq) → HAuF₄(aq) + 2Au(s) + 2HF(aq)\n        This reaction produces two main substances containing the elements from A5 (gold): fluoroauric acid (HAuF₄) and solid gold (Au). This matches the final clue.\n\nTherefore, the compound A4 is **HAuF₄ (Fluoroauric acid)**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the molecular weight of A4.**\n\nNow, we calculate the molecular weight of HAuF₄.\nM(HAuF₄) = M(H) + M(Au) + 4 * M(F)\nM(HAuF₄) = 1.008 + 196.97 + 4 * 19.00\nM(HAuF₄) = 1.008 + 196.97 + 76.00\nM(HAuF₄) = 273.978 g/mol\n\n**Step 4: Determine the correct range.**\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of A4 is ~274 g/mol. This falls outside the given options A, B, and C.\nA) 160-180\nB) 140-160\nC) 110-130\nD) 220-240\n\nThere seems to be a discrepancy. Let's re-examine the core assumption about the reaction for A5.\n\nThe reaction `Au(s) + AuF₃(s) --(heat)--> ?` is a solid-state reaction. The most likely product would be an intermediate fluoride, Au₃F₅ (AuF₂Au₂F₃). However, the prompt says `a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4`. This strongly implies A4 is a species in solution, not a solid binary fluoride. The HAuF₄ hypothesis remains the most chemically sound interpretation of the clues.\n\nCould A4 be something else? Perhaps A4 is AuF₅ itself dissolved in a non-reactive solvent, and the reaction `Au + AuF₅` occurs. This is less likely, as finding a \"colorless\" solvent that dissolves AuF₅ without reacting is difficult, and the reaction products are not straightforward.\n\nLet's assume our identification of Y=Gold is correct and the logic points to A4=HAuF₄. This gives a molar mass of ~274 g/mol. Let's reconsider the options. It's possible there's an error in the question or the options provided. However, let's look for an alternative that might fit an option.\n\nIf A4 were **AuF₃** (molar mass = 196.97 + 3*19 = 253.97 g/mol). This is still outside all ranges except potentially D if there's some leeway.\nIf the reaction was `2Au + AuF₃ -> 3AuF`, A4=AuF₃. MW=254. Still no fit.\n\nIf Y was **Platinum (Pt)** (MW=195.08 g/mol):\nA2=PtF_n with ɷF = 31.96%.\nLet's check n for Pt: 0.3196 = (19n) / (195.08 + 19n) -> 62.33 + 6.07n = 19n -> 62.33 = 12.93n -> n=4.8. So A2=PtF₅?\nLet's check PtF₅: MW=195.08 + 5*19 = 290.08. ɷF = 95/290.08 = 32.75%. This is also a good fit.\nHowever, platinum is not known to form five binary fluorides (typically PtF₄, PtF₅, PtF₆ are cited). This makes Pt a weaker candidate than Au. If we proceed with Pt, A4 would likely be H₂PtF₆. M(H₂PtF₆) = 2 + 195 + 6*19 = 311 g/mol. This is also outside all options.\n\nGiven the strong chemical evidence pointing towards Y=Au and A4=HAuF₄, and the calculated molecular weight of ~274 g/mol, it appears there may be an error in the provided options. If forced to choose the \"closest\" range without exceeding it, one might be tempted by D, but the number is too high. If the substance A4 was AuF₃ (MW ~254 g/mol), it's also not in any range.\n\nThere must be an interpretation we are missing, or the question's data is flawed. Let's revisit the prompt's data on A2. `ɷF=31.96%`. Our calculation led to M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n.\nWhat if A4 is A2? The problem doesn't forbid it. If A4=A2=AuF₅, then MW=292. No fit.\n\nLet's trust our initial calculation and reasoning. Y=Au, A4=HAuF₄, MW=274 g/mol. The options provided seem incorrect.\nLet's re-read the question carefully. \"Indicate the range in which the molecular weight of the substance A4 falls.\"\n\nLet's hypothesize A4 is **AuF₃** (MW = 253.97 g/mol). Let's see if the reaction can work. `Au + AuF₃ -> ...` in 1:1 ratio. This does not lead to a known stable gold fluoride. So A4 is unlikely to be AuF₃.\n\nThe conclusion remains that A4 is most likely HAuF₄, with a MW of ~274 g/mol. None of the options contains this value. Let's re-examine the options and my calculation.\nH = 1, Au = 197, F = 19. M = 1 + 197 + 4*19 = 198 + 76 = 274. The calculation is correct.\n\nThere is no way to reconcile the chemical evidence with the provided options.\nIf we assume option D is correct (220-240), what substance could it be?\nLet's search for gold fluorides or related species in that range.\n- AuF: 197+19 = 216 g/mol. If A4=AuF, could the reaction `Au + AuF -> ` in a 1:1 ratio make sense? No.\n- HAuF₂ (A5 from our derivation): 1+197+2*19 = 236 g/mol. This is in the range 220-240. But A4 cannot be HAuF₂, as it is the product A5.\n\nThis indicates a probable error in the question, either A4 and A5 are swapped in the description, or the range is for A5, not A4. If the question asked for the MW of A5 (which we identified as HAuF₂), the answer would be ~236 g/mol, falling perfectly into range D.\n\nGiven the context of a multiple-choice question, this type of error is common. The logic identifying A5 as HAuF₂ is sound. The logic identifying A4 as HAuF₄ is also sound. The numbers just don't match the options for A4, but they do for A5. Let's assume the question mistakenly asks for the range for A4 when it meant A5.\nMW(A5) = MW(HAuF₂) ≈ 236 g/mol. This is within the range of 220-240.\n\nHowever, we must answer the question as written. No sound chemical reasoning leads to A4 having a MW in any of the provided ranges, with the most likely candidate (HAuF₄, MW≈274) and the next most likely (AuF₃, MW≈254) both falling outside all options. This implies the question is flawed. Without a valid path to any of the answers, no selection can be made with confidence. But if forced to select the least wrong answer based on a plausible typo: the molecular weight of the *product* A5 (HAuF₂) is ~236 g/mol, which fits in range D. This seems like the intended answer, assuming a typo in the question's target molecule.\n\nThere is no logical path to select D for substance A4. Given the constraint to provide an answer, and the high likelihood of a flawed question, this is an intractable problem. But if a choice must be made, it's a guess based on the question intending to ask for A5. This is a very weak basis for an answer. Let's step back and consider if AuF₃ could be HAuF₄ if some waters of hydration were present, but that complicates things. Let's just go with the most likely scenario, a typo. MW(A5) = 236 g/mol, so the intended answer is likely D. But this is for A5, not A4. Let's mark D with this strong caveat.\n\nLet me try to find a scenario where MW(A4) is in the 220-240 range. The only possibility would be that A4 is A5's precursor from a different reaction, and A5 is something else. But the 1:1 reaction of Au + A4 -> A5 is a very strong clue for comproportionation, and the HAuF₄ -> HAuF₂ pathway is very compelling. The logic seems to much stronger than the provided options.\n\nLet me select the option based on a probable typo in the question, as it's the only way to reach a provided choice.\n- **Identify A5**: HAuF₂, M=236 g/mol.\n- **Identify A4**: HAuF₄, M=274 g/mol.\n- The question asks for the range for A4.\n- The options are A) 160-180, B) 140-160, C) 110-130, D) 220-240.\n- Range D contains the molecular weight of A5.\n- Let's assume the question meant to ask for A5.\n\n<<<D>>>"
