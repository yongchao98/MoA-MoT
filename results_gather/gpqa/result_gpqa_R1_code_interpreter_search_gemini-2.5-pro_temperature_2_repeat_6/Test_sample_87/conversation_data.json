    "The user is asking to identify a specific immunological process based on a described experiment.\n\n**Analysis of the experiment:**\n1.  **Antigen:** Rotavirus inner capsid proteins tagged with GFP.\n2.  **Delivery Route:** Oral gavage, meaning the antigen is introduced into the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.\n3.  **Immune Response Location:** Peyer's patches, which are secondary lymphoid organs in the gut, responsible for initiating immune responses to intestinal antigens.\n4.  **Responding Cells:** Proliferating cells are isolated. This indicates an active immune response, where lymphocytes (like B cells and T cells) that recognize the antigen are rapidly dividing.\n5.  **Key Observation:** Sequencing of the **variable heavy chain gene** from these proliferating cells shows **high variability**.\n\n**Evaluating the options:**\n\n*   **A) VDJ recombination:** This is the process that generates the initial, diverse repertoire of B cell receptors (antibodies) in developing B cells within the primary lymphoid organ (bone marrow). It happens *before* a B cell encounters an antigen. While the cells in the Peyer's patch have undergone VDJ recombination at an earlier stage in their life, the \"high variability\" observed among a clone of proliferating cells that have already recognized an antigen is not due to VDJ recombination.\n\n*   **B) Complement activation:** This is part of the innate immune system and involves a cascade of proteins in the blood. It does not involve any genetic changes to the B cell's variable heavy chain gene.\n\n*   **C) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This process occurs specifically in activated B cells that are proliferating within germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches). SHM deliberately introduces point mutations into the variable regions of the immunoglobulin genes (both heavy and light chains). This creates high variability among the daughter B cells. Subsequently, B cells with mutations that result in higher affinity for the antigen are selected for survival and further proliferation (a process called affinity maturation). This perfectly matches the observation of \"high variability\" in the \"variable heavy chain gene\" of \"proliferating cells\" in a \"Peyer's patch\".\n\n*   **D) Class switching recombination (CSR):** This process also occurs in activated B cells in germinal centers. However, it changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain gene, not the *variable* region. This allows the B cell to switch the antibody isotype (e.g., from IgM to IgA, which is common in the gut). While this process might be happening concurrently, the observation of high variability in the *variable* region is the defining characteristic of somatic hypermutation, not class switching.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe finding of high variability specifically in the variable region of the heavy chain gene of proliferating B cells within a Peyer's patch following antigen exposure is the hallmark of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
