    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Information Given in the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\nFirst, let's deconstruct the spectral data provided for the 1:1 mixture of two C10H14 isomers.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals, both of which are singlets. Their integration ratio is 1:1.\n    *   A singlet indicates that the aromatic protons have no adjacent (or vicinal) proton neighbors.\n    *   A 1:1 integration ratio in a 1:1 molar mixture means that the number of protons giving rise to the first singlet is equal to the number of protons giving rise to the second singlet. For example, this could be a 2H singlet from Compound A and a 2H singlet from Compound B.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all of which are singlets. Their integration ratio is 2:1:1.\n    *   Singlets in this region are characteristic of methyl (CH3) groups attached to the aromatic ring that have no protons on adjacent carbons of the ring.\n    *   The total number of alkyl protons in one molecule of tetramethylbenzene (C6H2(CH3)4) is 4 * 3 = 12 protons. Since we have a 1:1 mixture, the spectrum represents a total of 12 + 12 = 24 alkyl protons.\n    *   The integration ratio is 2:1:1. The sum of the ratio parts is 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.\n    *   We can calculate the number of protons corresponding to each signal:\n        *   Signal 1 (ratio 2): (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n        *   Signal 2 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n        *   Signal 3 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   Therefore, the three alkyl singlets must correspond to groups of 12, 6, and 6 protons.\n\n**Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Potential Compound**\n\nLet's predict the number of signals, their multiplicity, and their integrations for each compound listed in the options. All options have the molecular formula C10H14.\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   Due to its high symmetry, the two aromatic protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   The four methyl groups (at C1, C2, C4, C5) are also equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   The two aromatic protons (at C4 and C6) are in different chemical environments. They will produce **two distinct singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: {C1, C3}, {C2}, and {C5}. This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of **6H:3H:3H**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   Due to a plane of symmetry, the two aromatic protons (at C5 and C6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   There are two distinct sets of equivalent methyl groups: {C1, C4} and {C2, C3}. This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H** (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   The four aromatic protons are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **4H**.\n    *   The alkyl protons of the ethyl groups will show splitting. The methylene (CH2) protons will be a **quartet** (4H), and the methyl (CH3) protons will be a **triplet** (6H). The presence of non-singlet signals in the alkyl region immediately eliminates this compound as a possibility, as the problem states all three alkyl signals are singlets.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Combinations from the Options**\n\nNow we combine the predicted spectra for the pairs in each option to see which one matches the observed data.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic: One 2H singlet from 1,2,3,4-isomer + Two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-isomer = 3 aromatic signals. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   Alkyl: The spectrum would contain a quartet and a triplet from 1,4-diethylbenzene, which contradicts the \"all singlets\" description. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic: One 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5-isomer + Two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-isomer = 3 aromatic signals. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one 2H singlet.\n        *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes one 2H singlet.\n        *   The mixture shows **two singlets**. Since it's a 1:1 molar mixture and both signals represent 2 protons, the integration ratio is 2H:2H, which simplifies to **1:1**. This **matches** the experimental data.\n    *   **Alkyl Region:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes **one singlet for 12H**.\n        *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes **two singlets, each for 6H**.\n        *   The mixture shows a total of **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also **matches** the experimental data.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nA 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only combination that perfectly explains all features of the given 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>"
