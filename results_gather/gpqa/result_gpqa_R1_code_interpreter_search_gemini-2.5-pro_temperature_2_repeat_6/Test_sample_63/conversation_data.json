    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the experimental results to identify the decomposition products.**\n\n1.  **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water. The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water (H₂O) produced by the decomposition.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 2(1.0) + 16.0 = 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n2.  **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is a lime water test. The fact that its weight did not change indicates that no acidic gases (like CO₂, SO₂, NO₂) were formed during the decomposition.\n\n3.  **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Copper at high temperatures reacts with oxidizing agents. The problem states that CuO was formed and the mass of the tube increased by 0.80 g. This mass increase is due to the oxygen atoms binding to the copper.\n    *   Mass of Oxygen atoms = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This oxygen came from an oxidizing gas, for example, O₂ (in which case it would be 0.025 mol of O₂) or N₂O (0.05 mol of N₂O).\n\n4.  **Remaining Gas C:** After all reactions, 2.24 L of a gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of gas C = Volume / Molar volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n    *   This gas is inert to all reagents (Mg(ClO₄)₂, Ca(OH)₂, hot Cu), which strongly suggests it is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the elemental composition of the original salt mixture.**\n\nThe total mass of the gaseous products must equal the initial mass of the salts, 7.20 g, by the law of conservation of mass. We can now find the mass and moles of each element in the original mixture.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.2 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 0.2 mol H₂O × 2 H/H₂O = 0.4 mol H.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.4 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.4 g.\n\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and the oxidizing gas.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = (moles O in H₂O) + (moles O that reacted with Cu) = 0.2 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol O.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.0 g.\n\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** The remaining mass must be nitrogen, as no other elements are indicated.\n    *   Mass of N = Total mass - Mass(H) - Mass(O) = 7.20 g - 0.4 g - 4.0 g = 2.8 g.\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2.8 g / 14.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol N.\n\nThe total elemental composition of the 7.20 g mixture is H(0.4 mol), N(0.2 mol), and O(0.25 mol).\n\n**Step 3: Identify the salts A and B.**\n\nWe have an equimolar mixture (moles A = moles B = n) of two salts containing only H, N, and O.\nThe only plausible cation is the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺). The anions must be oxyanions of nitrogen (e.g., NO₃⁻ or NO₂⁻).\n\nLet's check the ratio of the elements for the combined formula of (A+B):\nH : N : O = 0.4 : 0.2 : 0.25\nTo get small integers, we can multiply by 20:\nH : N : O = 8 : 4 : 5\n\nLet salt A be NH₄NOₓ and salt B be NH₄NOᵧ.\nThe chemical formula for NH₄NOₓ is N₂H₄Oₓ.\nThe chemical formula for NH₄NOᵧ is N₂H₄Oᵧ.\nAn equimolar sum gives the combined formula: N₂H₄Oₓ + N₂H₄Oᵧ = N₄H₈O(x+y).\nComparing this to our determined ratio of H₈N₄O₅, we see a perfect match for H and N.\nFor oxygen, this means x + y = 5.\n\nThe common stable oxyanions of nitrogen are nitrite (NO₂⁻, so x=2) and nitrate (NO₃⁻, so y=3).\nIndeed, 2 + 3 = 5.\nTherefore, the two salts are:\n*   Salt A: Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂)\n*   Salt B: Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)\n\n**Step 4: Verify the identification with the given masses.**\n\nLet's check if a 7.20 g equimolar mixture is possible.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14+4+14+32 = 64 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14+4+14+48 = 80 g/mol.\nThe mass of an equimolar mixture of n moles of each is: `mass = n * (64 + 80) = n * 144`.\nGiven mass = 7.20 g.\n`7.20 = n * 144`\n`n = 7.20 / 144 = 0.05 mol`.\nThis confirms that an equimolar mixture of these two salts is consistent with all the data provided.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (i.e., in one formula unit of A and one formula unit of B).\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 1 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 1 Nitrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 1 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 1 Nitrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = 8 (from salt A) + 9 (from salt B) = 17.\n\n```python\n# Final calculation check\n# Molar Masses (approximate)\nM_H = 1\nM_N = 14\nM_O = 16\n\n# Given data\nmass_total = 7.20\nmass_h2o = 3.60\nmass_o_gain = 0.80\nvol_gas_c = 2.24\n\n# Moles of products\nmoles_h2o = mass_h2o / (2*M_H + M_O)  # 3.6 / 18 = 0.2 mol\nmoles_o_atoms_react = mass_o_gain / M_O # 0.8 / 16 = 0.05 mol\nmoles_gas_c = vol_gas_c / 22.4 # 2.24 / 22.4 = 0.1 mol\n\n# Elemental moles in the mixture\nmoles_H = moles_h2o * 2 # 0.2 * 2 = 0.4 mol\nmoles_O = moles_h2o + moles_o_atoms_react # 0.2 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol\nmass_H = moles_H * M_H # 0.4 * 1 = 0.4 g\nmass_O = moles_O * M_O # 0.25 * 16 = 4.0 g\nmass_N = mass_total - mass_H - mass_O # 7.2 - 0.4 - 4.0 = 2.8 g\nmoles_N = mass_N / M_N # 2.8 / 14 = 0.2 mol\n\n# Elemental ratio (H:N:O) -> 0.4 : 0.2 : 0.25. Multiplied by 20 -> 8:4:5\n# This corresponds to N4H8O5, which is NH4NO2 + NH4NO3\n\n# Atoms in each salt formula unit\n# Salt A: NH4NO2 -> N2H4O2\natoms_A = 2 + 4 + 2\n# Salt B: NH4NO3 -> N2H4O3\natoms_B = 2 + 4 + 3\n\n# Total atoms\ntotal_atoms = atoms_A + atoms_B\nprint(f\"Total atoms = {total_atoms}\")\n```\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The step-by-step reasoning has been laid out, and all calculations have been performed and verified.\n\n1.  **Analyze Products from Mass Changes:**\n    *   The mass increase in tube №1 (Mg(ClO₄)₂) is due to the absorption of water (H₂O).\n        *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O = 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n    *   The weight of tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂) did not change, indicating the absence of acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂.\n    *   The mass increase in tube №3 (hot copper) is due to oxygen binding to form CuO.\n        *   Mass of Oxygen = 0.80 g.\n        *   Moles of Oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol. This oxygen must have come from an oxidizing gas.\n    *   The remaining gas C is 2.24 L at STP.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol. Since it is inert to all the previous reagents, it is very likely Nitrogen (N₂).\n\n2.  **Determine Elemental Composition of the Initial Mixture:**\n    *   The total mass of the gaseous products is the sum of the mass of water, the mass of oxygen that reacted, and the mass of the final gas C. Let's first determine the mass of gas C. Since we concluded it's N₂, its molar mass is 28 g/mol. Mass of Gas C = 0.1 mol * 28 g/mol = 2.8 g.\n    *   Let's check for conservation of mass. Total mass of products = Mass(H₂O) + Mass(O that reacted with Cu) + Mass(Gas C before reacting) is tricky. It's better to work with the elemental masses from the initial 7.20 g mixture.\n    *   **Mass of Hydrogen:** From 0.2 mol of H₂O, moles of H atoms = 2 × 0.2 mol = 0.4 mol. Mass = 0.4 mol × 1 g/mol = 0.4 g.\n    *   **Mass of Oxygen:** From 0.2 mol of H₂O (0.2 mol O atoms) and 0.05 mol O atoms that reacted with Cu. Total moles of O atoms = 0.2 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol. Mass = 0.25 mol × 16 g/mol = 4.0 g.\n    *   **Mass of Nitrogen:** The salts must be composed of H, N, and O. Mass of N = Total Mass - Mass(H) - Mass(O) = 7.20 g - 0.4 g - 4.0 g = 2.8 g. Moles of N atoms = 2.8 g / 14 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n3.  **Identify the Salts A and B:**\n    *   The original mixture contained 0.4 mol H, 0.2 mol N, and 0.25 mol O.\n    *   The molar ratio of H:N is 0.4:0.2, which is 2:1. A combination of ammonium salts (NH₄⁺) gives a H:N ratio of 4:2 or 2:1, which fits perfectly. The salts are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions.\n    *   Let the salts be NH₄NOₓ and NH₄NOᵧ.\n    *   The mixture is equimolar, meaning moles of A = moles of B = n.\n    *   From the moles of Nitrogen: n(moles N in A) + n(moles N in B) = n(2) + n(2) = 4n = 0.2 mol N atoms. This gives n = 0.05 mol.\n    *   From the moles of Hydrogen: n(4) + n(4) = 8n = 0.4 mol H atoms. This gives n = 0.05 mol. The values are consistent.\n    *   From the moles of Oxygen: n(x) + n(y) = n(x+y) = 0.05(x+y) = 0.25 mol O atoms.\n    *   Solving for (x+y): x+y = 0.25 / 0.05 = 5.\n    *   The two most common stable nitrogen oxyanions are nitrite (NO₂⁻, so x=2) and nitrate (NO₃⁻, so y=3). 2 + 3 = 5.\n    *   Therefore, salt A is ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and salt B is ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\n4.  **Calculate Total Atoms:**\n    *   Atoms in one formula unit of salt A (NH₄NO₂): 2(N) + 4(H) + 2(O) = 8 atoms.\n    *   Atoms in one formula unit of salt B (NH₄NO₃): 2(N) + 4(H) + 3(O) = 9 atoms.\n    *   The total number of atoms in salts A and B is the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each.\n    *   Total atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
