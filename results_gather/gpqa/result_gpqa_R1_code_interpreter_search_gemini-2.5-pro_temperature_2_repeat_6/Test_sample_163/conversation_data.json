Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to determine the ratio of the total mass of binary star system_1 to that of system_2 (M_sys1 / M_sys2).\n\n2.  **Extract Given Information:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P1) = 2 years\n        *   Velocity amplitude of star A (K1a) = 10 km/s\n        *   Velocity amplitude of star B (K1b) = 5 km/s\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P2) = 1 year\n        *   Velocity amplitude of star A (K2a) = 15 km/s\n        *   Velocity amplitude of star B (K2b) = 10 km/s\n\n3.  **Identify Key Physics Principles:** The problem involves spectroscopic binary stars. The mass of such a system is related to its orbital period (P) and the radial velocity amplitudes (K) of its component stars. The relevant formula, derived from Kepler's Third Law, is the binary mass function:\n\n    M_total = (M1 + M2) = [P / (2 * π * G)] * [(K1 + K2)^3 / sin^3(i)]\n\n    where:\n    *   M_total is the total mass of the system.\n    *   P is the orbital period.\n    *   G is the gravitational constant.\n    *   K1 and K2 are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities for the two stars.\n    *   `i` is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n\n4.  **Apply a Crucial Simplification:** The problem states that both systems \"exhibit eclipses.\" For eclipses to be observable, our line of sight must be very close to the orbital plane of the stars. This means the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90 degrees.\n    *   If i ≈ 90°, then sin(i) ≈ 1, and therefore sin³(i) ≈ 1.\n    *   This simplifies the mass formula to:\n        M_total ≈ [P / (2 * π * G)] * (K1 + K2)³\n\n5.  **Set up the Ratio Calculation:** We need to find the ratio M_sys1 / M_sys2.\n\n    M_sys1 / M_sys2 = { [P1 / (2 * π * G)] * (K1a + K1b)³ } / { [P2 / (2 * π * G)] * (K2a + K2b)³ }\n\n    The constant term `1 / (2 * π * G)` is present in both the numerator and the denominator, so it cancels out.\n\n    M_sys1 / M_sys2 = (P1 / P2) * [(K1a + K1b) / (K2a + K2b)]³\n\n6.  **Calculate Intermediate Values:**\n    *   **Total velocity amplitude for System 1:**\n        K_sys1 = K1a + K1b = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n    *   **Total velocity amplitude for System 2:**\n        K_sys2 = K2a + K2b = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\n7.  **Perform the Final Calculation:** Substitute the periods and total velocity amplitudes into the simplified ratio formula. Note that since we are taking ratios, the units (years for period, km/s for velocity) will cancel out, so no conversion to SI units is necessary.\n```python\n# Periods of the systems in years\nP1 = 2\nP2 = 1\n\n# Sum of velocity amplitudes for each system in km/s\nK_total_1 = 10 + 5\nK_total_2 = 15 + 10\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the total masses\n# The formula is (M1/M2) = (P1/P2) * ((K_total_1)/(K_total_2))^3\nmass_ratio = (P1 / P2) * (K_total_1 / K_total_2)**3\n\nprint(mass_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.432\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated ratio of the masses (System 1 / System 2) is 0.432.\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated value of 0.432 is closest to option C.\n    *   A) ~ 1.2\n    *   B) ~ 0.7\n    *   C) ~ 0.4\n    *   D) ~ 0.6\n\nThe value 0.432 is approximately 0.4.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The code executed and returned a value of `0.432`.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1.  **Mass Formula:** For an eclipsing spectroscopic binary (where inclination `i` ≈ 90°, so sin³(i) ≈ 1), the total mass of the system (M) is proportional to the orbital period (P) multiplied by the cube of the sum of the velocity amplitudes (K_total).\n    *   M ∝ P * (K_total)³\n\n2.  **Ratio Setup:** We want to find the ratio of the mass of system 1 (M₁) to the mass of system 2 (M₂).\n    *   M₁ / M₂ = [P₁ * (K_total₁)³] / [P₂ * (K_total₂)³]\n\n3.  **Substitute Values:**\n    *   P₁ = 2 years\n    *   P₂ = 1 year\n    *   K_total₁ = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n    *   K_total₂ = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\n4.  **Calculate:**\n    *   M₁ / M₂ = (2 / 1) * (15 / 25)³\n    *   M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (0.6)³\n    *   M₁ / M₂ = 2 * 0.216\n    *   M₁ / M₂ = 0.432\n\nThe calculated value, 0.432, is approximately 0.4. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
