    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the energy spectrum.\n\n1.  **Understand the Potential:**\n    The potential is given in two-dimensional polar coordinates (r, θ):\n    $V(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)$\n    The Schrödinger equation is more easily solved if the potential is separable. Let's convert the potential into Cartesian coordinates (x, y) to check for separability.\n\n2.  **Coordinate Transformation:**\n    The relationships between Cartesian and polar coordinates are:\n    x = r cos(θ)\n    y = r sin(θ)\n    r^2 = x^2 + y^2\n\n    From these relationships, we can see that:\n    $x^2 = (r cos(θ))^2 = r^2 cos^2(θ)$\n\n    Now, substitute these into the potential expression:\n    $V(x, y) = 1/2 k (x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 k (x^2)$\n    Combine the terms with x² and y²:\n    $V(x, y) = (1/2 kx^2 + 3/2 kx^2) + 1/2 ky^2$\n    $V(x, y) = (4/2 kx^2) + 1/2 ky^2$\n    $V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2$\n\n3.  **Analyze the Hamiltonian:**\n    The potential is now in the form $V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)$, where $V_x(x) = 2kx^2$ and $V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2$. This represents two independent harmonic oscillators, one in the x-direction and one in the y-direction.\n\n    The total Hamiltonian for the particle is:\n    $H = T + V = (p_x^2 / 2m) + (p_y^2 / 2m) + V(x, y)$\n    Since the potential is separable, the Hamiltonian can also be separated into two independent parts:\n    $H = [(p_x^2 / 2m) + 2kx^2] + [(p_y^2 / 2m) + 1/2 ky^2]$\n    $H = H_x + H_y$\n\n    Here, $H_x$ and $H_y$ are the Hamiltonians for one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillators (QHO).\n\n4.  **Find the Frequencies of the Oscillators:**\n    The standard potential for a 1D harmonic oscillator is given by $V(q) = 1/2 mω^2q^2$, where ω is the angular frequency. We can compare this standard form to our potentials $V_x(x)$ and $V_y(y)$ to find their respective frequencies, ω_x and ω_y.\n\n    For the x-direction:\n    $V_x(x) = 2kx^2 = 1/2 mω_x^2x^2$\n    $=> mω_x^2 = 4k$\n    $=> ω_x^2 = 4k/m$\n    $=> ω_x = \\sqrt{4k/m} = 2\\sqrt{k/m}$\n\n    For the y-direction:\n    $V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2 = 1/2 mω_y^2y^2$\n    $=> mω_y^2 = k$\n    $=> ω_y^2 = k/m$\n    $=> ω_y = \\sqrt{k/m}$\n\n5.  **Determine the Energy Spectrum:**\n    The energy eigenvalues for a 1D QHO with frequency ω are given by $E_n = (n + 1/2)ℏω$, where n = 0, 1, 2, ... is the quantum number.\n\n    Since our system is a sum of two independent oscillators, the total energy E is the sum of the energies from each oscillator:\n    $E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}$\n    where $n_x$ and $n_y$ are the quantum numbers for the x and y oscillators, respectively.\n\n    Substitute the energy expressions and frequencies:\n    $E = (n_x + 1/2)ℏω_x + (n_y + 1/2)ℏω_y$\n    $E = (n_x + 1/2)ℏ(2\\sqrt{k/m}) + (n_y + 1/2)ℏ(\\sqrt{k/m})$\n\n    Now, factor out the common term $ℏ\\sqrt{k/m}$:\n    $E = [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] ℏ\\sqrt{k/m}$\n    $E = [2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2] ℏ\\sqrt{k/m}$\n    $E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ℏ\\sqrt{k/m}$\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated energy spectrum is $E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ℏ\\sqrt{k/m}$.\n    Comparing this with the given options:\n    A) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    B) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    C) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\n    D) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n\n    The result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
