    "Here's my thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** I first need to understand all the pieces of information provided and what the question is asking.\n    *   **System:** Two stars (Star 1, Star 2) and two planets (Planet 1, Planet 2).\n    *   **Given parameters:**\n        *   Star masses are equal: $M_{s1} = M_{s2}$.\n        *   Planet masses are similar: $m_{p1} \\approx m_{p2}$.\n        *   Orbits are circular: eccentricity $e=0$.\n        *   The detection method is Radial Velocity (RV).\n    *   **Observations:**\n        *   Planet 1 causes a periodic wavelength shift of $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ milliangstroms.\n        *   Planet 2 causes a periodic wavelength shift of $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ milliangstroms.\n    *   **Question:** What is the ratio of the orbital periods, $P_2 / P_1$?\n\n2.  **Relate Observations to Physical Quantities:** The RV method measures the velocity of a star along our line of sight. A periodic shift in a spectral line's wavelength ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is caused by the Doppler effect due to this velocity ($v_r$).\n    *   The Doppler formula is $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c}$, where $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength and $c$ is the speed of light.\n    *   The *maximum* observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$) corresponds to the maximum line-of-sight velocity of the star. This maximum velocity is known as the RV semi-amplitude, denoted by $K$.\n    *   From the formula, we can see that $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max}$.\n    *   Therefore, the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes of the two stars is the same as the ratio of their maximum wavelength shifts:\n        $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1} = \\frac{7 \\text{ m\\AA}}{5 \\text{ m\\AA}} = \\frac{7}{5}$\n\n3.  **Find the Governing Equation:** I need the equation that connects the RV semi-amplitude ($K$) to the orbital period ($P$) and other system parameters.\n    *   For a planet in an orbit, the formula for the RV semi-amplitude of the host star is:\n        $K = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{P} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{M_{star}^{2/3} \\sqrt{1-e^2}}$\n    *   The problem states the orbits are circular, so eccentricity $e=0$, which makes the term $\\sqrt{1-e^2} = 1$.\n    *   The simplified formula is:\n        $K = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{P} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{M_{star}^{2/3}}$\n\n4.  **Set up a Ratio and Simplify:** I will write the equation for each system and then divide one by the other to cancel out common terms.\n    *   For System 1: $K_1 = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{P_1} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_{p1} \\sin i_1}{M_{s1}^{2/3}}$\n    *   For System 2: $K_2 = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{P_2} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_{p2} \\sin i_2}{M_{s2}^{2/3}}$\n\n    *   Now, I take the ratio $K_2 / K_1$:\n        $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{P_2} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_{p2} \\sin i_2}{M_{s2}^{2/3}}}{\\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{P_1} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_{p1} \\sin i_1}{M_{s1}^{2/3}}}$\n\n    *   I can now cancel terms based on the information given:\n        *   $G$ is a constant, so $2\\pi G$ cancels.\n        *   $M_{s1} = M_{s2}$, so the stellar mass terms cancel.\n        *   The term $m_p \\sin i$ is what the RV method actually measures, often called the \"minimum mass\". When the problem states the planets have \"similar masses\", it is most likely referring to this observable quantity ($m_p \\sin i$). Thus, we can assume $m_{p1} \\sin i_1 \\approx m_{p2} \\sin i_2$, and this entire term cancels out. (Even if we interpret it as $m_{p1} \\approx m_{p2}$, for a solvable problem, we must assume the inclination angles $i$ are the same, leading to the same cancellation).\n\n    *   After cancellation, the expression simplifies significantly:\n        $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{(1/P_2)^{1/3}}{(1/P_1)^{1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n5.  **Solve for the Desired Ratio:** Now I need to rearrange the equation to solve for $P_2 / P_1$.\n    *   I have the relationship: $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n    *   First, I'll solve for $P_1/P_2$ by cubing both sides:\n        $\\left(\\frac{K_2}{K_1}\\right)^3 = \\frac{P_1}{P_2}$\n    *   Then, I'll take the reciprocal to find $P_2 / P_1$:\n        $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Answer:** I'll substitute the numerical values into the final expression.\n    *   We know $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{5}{7}$.\n    *   $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3$\n    *   To get the precise numerical value, I will use a code calculation.\n\n```python\n# The ratio of the periods P2/P1 is related to the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes K1/K2.\n# The relationship is P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.\n# The RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to the observed wavelength shift.\n# So, K1/K2 is equal to the ratio of the shifts, which is 5/7.\nratio_P2_over_P1 = (5/7)**3\nprint(ratio_P2_over_P1)\n```\n\n>>>0.36443148688046646\n\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 0.364. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Physics and the Observables**\n\n*   **Radial Velocity (RV) Method:** This method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic \"wobble\" of their host star. This wobble is caused by the gravitational pull of the orbiting planet. The star moves towards and away from us, causing its spectral lines to shift periodically due to the Doppler effect.\n*   **Doppler Shift and Velocity:** The observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's velocity along our line of sight ($v_r$). The maximum shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$) corresponds to the maximum line-of-sight velocity, known as the RV semi-amplitude, $K$.\n*   **Relationship between Observables:** Since $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max}$, we can establish a ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes for the two stars:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1} = \\frac{7 \\text{ miliangstrom}}{5 \\text{ miliangstrom}} = \\frac{7}{5}$\n\n**2. The Governing Equation**\n\nThe formula that links the RV semi-amplitude ($K$) to the orbital and physical properties of the system (for a single planet) is:\n\n$K = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{P} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{M_{star}^{2/3} \\sqrt{1-e^2}}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $P$ is the orbital period.\n*   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n*   $m_p$ is the planet's mass.\n*   $M_{star}$ is the star's mass.\n*   $i$ is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between the orbital plane and our line of sight).\n*   $e$ is the eccentricity of the orbit.\n\n**3. Simplify the Equation based on the Problem's Conditions**\n\nThe problem states several conditions that allow us to simplify this equation:\n\n*   The orbits are circular, so eccentricity $e = 0$. This makes the term $\\sqrt{1-e^2} = 1$.\n*   The stars have the same mass: $M_{s1} = M_{s2}$.\n*   The planets have similar masses: $m_{p1} \\approx m_{p2}$.\n*   Since the problem is solvable, we must assume that the unknown inclination angles are also similar, $i_1 \\approx i_2$. This is a standard assumption in such comparative problems.\n\nThe simplified formula becomes: $K = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{P} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{M_{star}^{2/3}}$\n\n**4. Set Up a Ratio to Find the Relationship between Periods**\n\nLet's write the equation for each system and then divide them to cancel out the common terms.\n\n$\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{P_2} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_{p2} \\sin i_2}{M_{s2}^{2/3}}}{\\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{P_1} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_{p1} \\sin i_1}{M_{s1}^{2/3}}}$\n\nNow we cancel terms based on our conditions:\n*   $2\\pi G$ cancels out.\n*   $M_{s1}^{2/3}$ and $M_{s2}^{2/3}$ cancel because $M_{s1} = M_{s2}$.\n*   $m_{p1} \\sin i_1$ and $m_{p2} \\sin i_2$ cancel because the masses and inclinations are assumed to be similar.\n\nThis leaves us with a much simpler relationship:\n$\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{(1/P_2)^{1/3}}{(1/P_1)^{1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n**5. Solve for the Desired Ratio ($P_2 / P_1$)**\n\nWe need to rearrange the equation to solve for $P_2 / P_1$.\n\n1.  Cube both sides:\n    $\\left(\\frac{K_2}{K_1}\\right)^3 = \\frac{P_1}{P_2}$\n\n2.  Invert both sides to get the final expression:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3$\n\n**6. Substitute Values and Calculate**\n\nWe already established that $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{7}{5}$, so $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{5}{7}$.\n\n$\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{125}{343}$\n\n$\\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\approx 0.3644$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36.\n\n<<<A>>>"
