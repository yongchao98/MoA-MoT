    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a trans-alkene. This molecule is achiral.\n    ```\n       H     CH2CH2CH3\n        \\   /\n         C=C\n        /   \\\n    CH3CH2CH2   H\n    ```\n*   **Reagent 1: mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid).** This reagent performs epoxidation, which is a syn-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n    *   When an achiral trans-alkene undergoes epoxidation (a syn-addition), it forms a trans-epoxide. Since the starting alkene is symmetric, the attack can happen from the top face or the bottom face with equal probability.\n    *   Attack from one face produces the (4R,5R)-epoxide. Attack from the other face produces the (4S,5S)-epoxide.\n    *   These two products, (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane, are enantiomers.\n    *   Thus, the first step produces a racemic mixture of the trans-epoxide.\n\n*   **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This causes the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. This reaction is an anti-addition. The water molecule attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite to the C-O bond, inverting the stereochemistry at the attacked carbon.\n    *   For a trans-epoxide, anti-addition of two -OH groups results in a meso diol.\n    *   Let's trace this:\n        *   (4R,5R)-epoxide + H₂O/H⁺ → Water attacks at C4 (inverting it to S) or C5 (inverting it to S). Since the molecule is symmetric, either attack gives the same product: (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol. This product is a meso compound (it has a center of inversion and is achiral).\n        *   (4S,5S)-epoxide + H₂O/H⁺ → Water attacks at C4 (inverting it to R) or C5 (inverting it to R). Either attack gives the same product: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. This is the same meso compound.\n    *   A useful mnemonic for stereospecific reactions on symmetrical alkenes: **Trans + Anti = Meso**. The overall reaction is an anti-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single compound, **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (Z)-oct-4-ene, which is a cis-alkene. This molecule is also achiral.\n    ```\n           H           H\n            \\         /\n             C-------C\n            /         \\\n    CH3CH2CH2   CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n*   **Reagent 1: mCPBA.** The syn-addition of oxygen to the cis-alkene will form a cis-epoxide.\n    *   Because the starting (Z)-alkene is achiral and symmetric, the addition of the oxygen atom from either face results in the same single product: (cis)-4,5-epoxyoctane, which is a meso compound, specifically (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n*   **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This performs the anti-addition ring-opening.\n    *   Starting with the meso-epoxide ((4R,5S)-epoxyoctane), the attack by water can occur at either C4 or C5.\n        *   Attack at C4 inverts its configuration (R → S), while C5 remains S. The product is **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n        *   Attack at C5 inverts its configuration (S → R), while C4 remains R. The product is **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n    *   These two products are enantiomers. Since the attacks at C4 and C5 are equally probable, they are formed in equal amounts.\n    *   The mnemonic for this is: **Cis + Anti = Racemic**.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A **racemic mixture** of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the relationships between these isomers:\n*   Compounds 2 and 3 are enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   Compound 1 is a diastereomer of both compound 2 and compound 3 (stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment, so they cannot be separated by an achiral column. They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated by an achiral column.\n    *   Therefore, the HPLC will show two peaks:\n        *   **Peak 1:** The racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diol.\n        *   **Peak 2:** The meso-diol.\n    *   **Result for standard HPLC: 2 peaks.**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   It can separate enantiomers.\n    *   It can also separate diastereomers.\n    *   Therefore, the chiral HPLC will resolve all three stereoisomers present in the mixture.\n        *   **Peak 1:** meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   **Peak 2:** (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   **Peak 3:** (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n    *   **Result for chiral HPLC: 3 peaks.**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard (achiral) HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
