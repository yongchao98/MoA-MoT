    "This problem is governed by the energy-time version of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the core concept**: The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that certain pairs of physical properties, like energy and time, cannot both be known with perfect accuracy. The relationship for energy and time is given by:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    where:\n    *   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy.\n    *   Δt is the uncertainty in time.\n    *   ħ (h-bar) is the reduced Planck constant (ħ = h / 2π).\n\n2.  **Relate the concept to the problem**: The \"lifetime\" (τ) of a quantum state can be considered as the time interval (Δt) over which we can observe the state. This finite lifetime introduces a fundamental uncertainty or \"width\" (ΔE) to the energy level. A shorter lifetime leads to a larger energy uncertainty. The formula is often approximated for calculations like this as:\n    ΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\n3.  **Define the condition for resolution**: For two energy levels, E1 and E2, to be \"clearly distinguished\" or \"resolved\", the difference in their energies (|E1 - E2|) must be greater than the uncertainty (or width) of each level. Practically, this means the energy difference must be larger than the *larger* of the two energy uncertainties.\n    |E1 - E2| > ΔE1 and |E1 - E2| > ΔE2.\n    This simplifies to:\n    |E1 - E2| > max(ΔE1, ΔE2)\n\n4.  **Calculate the energy uncertainties (widths)**:\n    *   We are given the lifetimes: τ1 = 10⁻⁹ s and τ2 = 10⁻⁸ s.\n    *   We need the value of the reduced Planck constant in units of eV·s: ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n    Now, we calculate the energy width for each state:\n    *   **State 1**: ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1 = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n    *   **State 2**: ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2 = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n5.  **Apply the resolution condition**:\n    *   The two energy widths are ΔE1 ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV and ΔE2 ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV.\n    *   The larger of the two uncertainties is ΔE1, which comes from the state with the shorter lifetime.\n    *   Therefore, to resolve the two levels, the energy difference between them must be greater than ~6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    |E1 - E2| > 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n6.  **Evaluate the given options**:\n    *   A) 10⁻⁹ eV < 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV (Not resolvable)\n    *   B) 10⁻⁴ eV > 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV (Resolvable)\n    *   C) 10⁻⁸ eV < 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV (Not resolvable)\n    *   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV < 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV (Not resolvable)\n\nOnly option B provides an energy difference large enough to clearly resolve the two quantum states.\n\n<<<B>>>"
