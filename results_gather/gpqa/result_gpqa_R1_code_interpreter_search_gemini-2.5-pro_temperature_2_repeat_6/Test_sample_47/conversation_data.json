    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and count its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂) to form product 1.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is the alpha-bromination of a ketone. Cyclohexanone reacts with bromine to substitute a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an α-carbon).\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclohexanone is a symmetrical ketone. The two α-carbons (C2 and C6) are chemically equivalent.\n*   **Product 1:** The product is 2-bromocyclohexanone. Bromination at C2 or C6 yields the same molecule.\n     \n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to form product 2.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is a classic Favorskii rearrangement. An α-halo ketone with an abstractable proton on the other α-carbon, when treated with a strong base, undergoes rearrangement to form a carboxylic acid derivative with a smaller ring.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) removes the acidic proton from C6 (the α-carbon not bearing the bromine).\n    2.  This forms an enolate ion.\n    3.  The enolate attacks the carbon bearing the bromine (C2) in an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion and forming a strained bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-7-one intermediate (a cyclopropanone derivative).\n    4.  The hydroxide ion then attacks the carbonyl carbon of the cyclopropanone.\n    5.  The three-membered ring opens to form a more stable five-membered ring (cyclopentane). This results in a carboxylate anion attached to the cyclopentane ring.\n    6.  Upon acidic workup (which is implicit in this context to get a stable organic molecule), the carboxylate is protonated.\n*   **Product 2:** The product is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n     \n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine to form product 3.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard procedure for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride (or acid chloride).\n*   **Reagents:** Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) is the chlorinating agent. Pyridine is a base used to neutralize the HCl gas produced during the reaction.\n*   **Product 3:** The hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine atom (-Cl), forming cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n     \n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃) to form product 4.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is the reduction of an acyl chloride.\n*   **Reagent:** LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃ is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent. Unlike the more powerful LiAlH₄ (which would reduce an acyl chloride all the way to a primary alcohol), LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃ is selective and stops the reduction at the aldehyde stage.\n*   **Product 4:** The product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n     \n\n**Final Step: Counting the chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4 (Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde).**\n\nTo count the number of chemically distinct hydrogens, we need to analyze the symmetry of the molecule.\nThe structure is a cyclopentane ring with a -CHO (aldehyde) group attached.\n\n*   The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C-CHO bond, the C1 carbon of the ring, the hydrogen on C1, and bisects the C3-C4 bond.\n\nLet's identify the different types of hydrogen atoms based on this symmetry:\n1.  **The aldehyde hydrogen (-CHO):** This hydrogen is unique and part of the symmetry plane. (1 type)\n2.  **The hydrogen on C1:** This hydrogen is on the carbon attached to the aldehyde group. It also lies on the symmetry plane and is unique. (1 type)\n3.  **The hydrogens on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes C2 and C5 equivalent. However, the two hydrogens on C2 are not equivalent to each other. They are diastereotopic because one is 'cis' and the other is 'trans' relative to the aldehyde group (in any given ring conformation). They cannot be interchanged by any symmetry operation. The same applies to the hydrogens on C5. Therefore, the four hydrogens on C2 and C5 represent two distinct chemical environments. (2 types)\n4.  **The hydrogens on C3 and C4:** The plane of symmetry also makes C3 and C4 equivalent. Similar to the C2/C5 case, the two hydrogens on C3 are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. The same is true for the hydrogens on C4. Therefore, the four hydrogens on C3 and C4 also represent two distinct chemical environments. (2 types)\n\n**Total Count:**\n*   Type 1: Aldehyde H (1 H)\n*   Type 2: C1-H (1 H)\n*   Type 3 & 4: C2/C5 Hs (4 H total)\n*   Type 5 & 6: C3/C4 Hs (4 H total)\n\nSumming them up, we have 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6 chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<D>>>"
