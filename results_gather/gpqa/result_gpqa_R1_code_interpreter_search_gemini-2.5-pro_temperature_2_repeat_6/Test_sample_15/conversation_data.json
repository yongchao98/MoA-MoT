    "To determine if a compound is optically active, we need to check if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This typically occurs in molecules that lack a plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion (i). Molecules with chiral centers are often chiral, but not if they are meso compounds.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   This is an alkene. The atoms of the double bond (C1, C2) and the atoms directly attached to them (Cl, H, C of methyl, C of ethyl) all lie in the same plane.\n    *   This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry.\n    *   A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   This name describes a specific stereoisomer of a complex molecule. The key is the presence of stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. These indicate that the compound has defined chiral centers at positions 3a and 7a.\n    *   A specific, single stereoisomer of a molecule with chiral centers is optically active unless it is a meso compound.\n    *   The parent structure might have some symmetry, but the substituent `8-(chloromethylene)`, which is a `=CHCl` group, at position 8 and in the (E) configuration, will almost certainly break any plane of symmetry the parent bicyclic system might have had.\n    *   Given that a specific enantiomer is named, it is intended to represent a chiral molecule.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   It has two chiral centers, C2 and C3.\n    *   The substituents on C2 are the same as on C3 (H, CH3, COOH, and the other chiral carbon group). This means we need to check for meso-possibility.\n    *   The configurations are opposite (2R, 3S). For a molecule of the type R-CH(X)-CH(X)-R, the (R,S) stereoisomer is the meso form.\n    *   Let's confirm the presence of a symmetry element. In the staggered anti-periplanar conformation, the molecule has a center of inversion (i). If you start at any atom or group and move through the midpoint of the C2-C3 bond to the other side, you find an identical atom or group.\n    *   Since it has a center of inversion, the molecule is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the previous compound. It has two chiral centers (C2, C3) with the same configuration (R,R).\n    *   This stereoisomer lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule.\n    *   Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) isomer. These two form an enantiomeric pair.\n    *   The question specifies the (2R,3R) isomer, which is a single enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond (C3=C4) and an alcohol group at C1.\n    *   Carbon C1 is attached to four different groups: -OH, -H, -CH=CH- (the C2-C3 part of the ring), and -CH2-CH2- (the C6-C5 part of the ring). Thus, C1 is a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   The name specifies the (R) configuration, meaning it is a single enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The nomenclature `(1s,3s,5s)` typically refers to the all-cis isomer, where all three -OH groups are on the same side of the ring.\n    *   This highly symmetrical molecule has a C3 axis of rotation and three vertical planes of symmetry (σv).\n    *   The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral. The carbons C1, C3, and C5 are prochiral, not chiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure is `(cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   Let's check for chiral centers. No carbon atom is bonded to four different groups. For instance, C3 of the butane chain is bonded to C2, H, and two identical methyl groups. The cyclopentyl ring carbons are also not chiral centers.\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry. This plane contains the `C=O`, `-CH2-`, `-CH-` and the `H` on the `-CH-` group, and bisects the cyclopentyl ring and the two terminal methyl groups. The existence of a conformation with a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically inactive**.\n\nTo summarize:\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-...-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive (meso)\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<C>>>"
