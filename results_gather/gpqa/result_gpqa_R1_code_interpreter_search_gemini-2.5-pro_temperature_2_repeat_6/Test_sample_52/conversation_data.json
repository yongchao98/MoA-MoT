    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to identify the correct chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Functional Groups and Core Structure:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This tells us we have a benzene ring with two things attached to it. The core formula for this part is `C6H4`. The ring itself accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (DBE).\n    *   **FTIR indicates an ester group:** The molecule contains a `-COO-` functional group. This accounts for the two oxygen atoms present in all the options and adds one more degree of unsaturation due to the `C=O` bond.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons (`C6H4`). These 4 protons giving two signals is very common, for example in a para-substituted ring where you would see two doublets. This confirms the `C6H4` fragment.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets):** This is highly informative about one of the substituents.\n        *   A \"quartet\" (`q`) splitting means a proton is adjacent to a `-CH3` group.\n        *   A \"doublet\" (`d`) splitting means a proton is adjacent to a single other proton.\n        *   Therefore, a \"doublet of quartets\" (`dq`) describes a proton (`Hb`) that is adjacent to both another single proton (`Ha`) and a `-CH3` group. The other vinyl proton (`Ha`) being a simple \"doublet\" confirms it's only adjacent to `Hb`.\n        *   This splitting pattern uniquely identifies a **propenyl group**: `(-CHa=CHb-CH3)`. This fragment has the formula `C3H5` and adds one more degree of unsaturation from the `C=C` bond.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:** We have identified one `-CH3` group as part of the propenyl substituent. The presence of a second `-CH3` signal means there is another, chemically distinct `-CH3` group elsewhere in the molecule.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a crucial piece of negative evidence. It rules out any ethyl (`-CH2CH3`), propyl (`-CH2CH2CH3`), or other groups containing a `CH2` moiety.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Formula:**\n    Let's collect all the mandatory pieces of the molecule we've identified from the spectra:\n    *   From the aromatic ring: `C6H4`\n    *   From the vinyl and one methyl signal: a propenyl group `C3H5` (`-CH=CH-CH3`)\n    *   From the second methyl signal: another `-CH3` group\n    *   From the ester functionality: a `-COO-` group, which contains one carbon (`C`) and two oxygens (`O2`).\n\n    Now, let's sum the atoms from these fragments to find the total molecular formula:\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from `C6H4`) + 3 (from `C3H5`) + 1 (from `-CH3`) + 1 (from `-COO-`) = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from `C6H4`) + 5 (from `C3H5`) + 3 (from `-CH3`) = **12**\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from `-COO-`) = **2**\n\n    The molecular formula is therefore **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Verify Against Other Options:**\n    *   **C11H12O2 (Our result):** Degrees of Unsaturation (DBE) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6. This matches our structural analysis (Ring=4 + C=O=1 + C=C=1 = 6 DBE). This is consistent.\n    *   **C11H14O2:** DBE = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 5. This is inconsistent with the presence of an aromatic ring, an ester, *and* a vinyl group, which requires 6 DBE.\n    *   **C12H14O2:** DBE = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 6. While the DBE is correct, to get from our required C11H12O2 structure to C12H14O2, one must add a `CH2` group. The NMR data explicitly states there are no `-CH2-` groups. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n    *   **C12H12O2:** DBE = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7. This would require an additional double bond or ring compared to the structure indicated by the spectra, which is not supported by the data.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only chemical formula that fits all the provided spectroscopic evidence is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>"
