    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the principle of conservation of energy.**\n    In a conservative system like a harmonic oscillator, the total energy is constant. For a relativistic system, the total energy is the sum of the relativistic kinetic energy ($K$) and the potential energy ($U$).\n\n2.  **Define the energy components.**\n    *   The potential energy of a harmonic oscillator is given by $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$, where $k$ is the spring constant and $x$ is the displacement from the equilibrium position ($x=0$).\n    *   The relativistic kinetic energy is given by $K = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$, where $m$ is the rest mass, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}$.\n    *   The total energy of the system, $E_{total}$, is the sum of kinetic and potential energy:\n        $E_{total} = K + U(x) = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n\n3.  **Apply the conservation of energy to two specific points in the oscillation.**\n    *   **Point 1: Maximum displacement (amplitude).**\n        At the maximum amplitude, $x = A$, the mass momentarily stops, so its velocity is $v = 0$.\n        When $v=0$, the Lorentz factor $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-0}} = 1$.\n        The kinetic energy at this point is $K = (1-1)mc^2 = 0$.\n        The potential energy is at its maximum: $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n        So, the total energy of the system is:\n        $E_{total} = 0 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n\n    *   **Point 2: Equilibrium position.**\n        At the equilibrium position, $x = 0$, the potential energy is zero: $U(0) = 0$.\n        At this point, the kinetic energy is maximum, which means the speed is maximum, $v = v_{max}$.\n        The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n        The kinetic energy at this point is $K_{max} = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\n        So, the total energy of the system is:\n        $E_{total} = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2 + 0 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\n\n4.  **Equate the total energy expressions.**\n    Since the total energy is conserved, the energy at Point 1 must equal the energy at Point 2:\n    $\\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\n\n5.  **Solve for $\\gamma_{max}$.**\n    Rearrange the equation:\n    $\\gamma_{max} - 1 = \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n    $\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$.\n\n6.  **Solve for $v_{max}$.**\n    Now, substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$ and solve for $v_{max}$:\n    $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$.\n\n    To isolate $v_{max}$, we perform the following algebraic steps:\n    *   Invert both sides:\n        $\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$.\n    *   Square both sides:\n        $1-\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$.\n    *   Rearrange the terms to solve for $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n        $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$.\n    *   Finally, solve for $v_{max}$:\n        $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$.\n\n7.  **Compare the result with the given options.**\n    The derived expression for $v_{max}$ is:\n    $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n    This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
