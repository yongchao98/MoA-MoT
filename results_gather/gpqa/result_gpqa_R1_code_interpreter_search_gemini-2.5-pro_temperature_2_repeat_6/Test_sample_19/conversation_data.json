    "This question asks for the assumptions that jointly define the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics. Let's break down the meaning of this approximation and evaluate each statement.\n\nThe **impulse approximation** is a model used to describe high-energy scattering from a composite system, like a nucleus. The core idea is that the interaction between the incoming probe (e.g., an electron, a neutrino) and one of the constituents (a nucleon) happens so quickly that the other parts of the system don't have time to react. In essence, the target nucleon is treated as a \"free\" particle during the brief moment of the collision.\n\nLet's analyze the given assumptions in this context:\n\n1.  **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.**\n    *   This is a foundational assumption for the impulse approximation. The model simplifies the complex reality of a many-body system by assuming the external probe picks out and interacts with just *one* nucleon at a time. This excludes more complex interactions, such as those involving meson-exchange currents where the probe interacts with the force-carrying particles between nucleons. Thus, this statement is a necessary component.\n\n2.  **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.**\n    *   This addresses the \"before\" and \"after\" of the main interaction. It means that the incoming probe is assumed to reach the target nucleon without interacting with any other nucleons first (no initial-state interactions). It also means that after the collision, the scattered probe and the ejected nucleon are assumed to leave the nucleus without any further interactions with the remaining \"spectator\" nucleons (no final-state interactions). If the nucleus were not transparent, these additional interactions would complicate the process significantly, violating the simple picture of a single, isolated collision. Therefore, this assumption is crucial for the impulse approximation to be a good description.\n\n3.  **The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.**\n    *   This statement concerns the internal structure of the nucleon itself. The impulse approximation treats nucleons as the fundamental degrees of freedom. It is largely agnostic about the sub-structure of those nucleons. Whether the quarks inside a nucleon are relativistic or not is a separate question, relevant to models of the nucleon's form factors or deep inelastic scattering, but it is not a defining assumption of the impulse approximation itself. The impulse approximation can be used, for example, in deep inelastic scattering where the internal constituents (quarks) are known to behave relativistically. Therefore, this assumption is not a necessary component of the impulse approximation.\n\n4.  **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.**\n    *   This is the very essence of the \"impulse\" concept. The collision is assumed to be so sudden (an \"impulse\") that the relatively slowly acting binding forces that hold the nucleon within the nucleus are negligible *during the interaction itself*. The nucleon's state *before* the collision is that of a bound particle (it has a momentum distribution determined by the nuclear potential), but the interaction Hamiltonian itself treats the nucleon as if it were free. This is the central simplification that allows one to use the well-understood properties of free nucleons in calculations for bound systems. This is a defining feature of the approximation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe three assumptions that are essential to the impulse approximation are:\n*   The interaction is with a single nucleon (Statement 1).\n*   The surrounding nuclear medium doesn't interfere with the incoming and outgoing particles (Statement 2).\n*   The binding force on the nucleon is ignored during the brief interaction (Statement 4).\n\nStatement 3 is about the internal physics of the nucleon, not its behavior within the nucleus during a scattering event, so it is not a required assumption for the impulse approximation.\n\nTherefore, the correct combination of assumptions is 1, 2, and 4. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
