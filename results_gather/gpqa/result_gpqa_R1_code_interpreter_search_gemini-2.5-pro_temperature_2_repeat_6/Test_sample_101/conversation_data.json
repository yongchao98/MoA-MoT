The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane barrel with eight alpha helices, four extracellular helices, and three beta sheets that create a binding site for the ligand. The ligand is a coiled-coil of two alpha helices. You create a bicistronic lox-Cre vector with the ligand ORF at the 5' position, fused to mCherry; the receptor ORF is at the 3' and fused to the eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and upstream of the receptor is the IRES regulatory element. Between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there is a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and between the receptor and the eGFP, there is a stop in the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette.

    "*   **Analysis of the experimental design:**\n    1.  **Construct:** The researcher has created a bicistronic vector. This means one mRNA transcript is produced, which can be used to translate two separate proteins.\n        *   **Promoter:** The CBA promoter is a strong, constitutive promoter, meaning it will drive high levels of transcription in most cell types.\n        *   **First Cistron:** `Ligand - [loxP-stop-loxP] - mCherry`. Before Cre recombination, translation starts and hits the stop codon in the cassette. Only the Ligand is produced. After Cre recombination, the stop cassette is removed, and a Ligand-mCherry fusion protein should be produced.\n        *   **IRES:** The Internal Ribosome Entry Site allows for cap-independent translation of the second protein from the same mRNA.\n        *   **Second Cistron:** `Receptor - [lox2272-stop-lox2272] - eGFP`. Similar to the first cistron, before Cre, only the Receptor protein is translated. After Cre recombination, a Receptor-eGFP fusion protein should be produced.\n    2.  **Initial Test (Astrocyte Transfection):** Astrocytes do not express Cre. When this plasmid is transfected, the stop cassettes remain in place. The antibodies are against the ligand and receptor. The Western blot result (\"Total proteins give a signal proportional to the actin loading\") confirms that the CBA promoter is active and that both the ligand and receptor proteins are successfully translated from the bicistronic mRNA (up to their respective stop cassettes). This test validates the basic integrity of the vector.\n    3.  **Mouse Cross:** A mouse homozygous for the construct (let's call it the \"Reporter\" mouse) is crossed with a SOX10-Cre mouse. SOX10 is a marker for neural crest cells, so Cre recombinase will be expressed specifically in the neural crest lineage in the offspring.\n    4.  **Cre-Lox Recombination:** Standard Cre recombinase recognizes and mediates recombination between two identical lox sites. It works for both loxP sites and lox2272 sites. Therefore, in the SOX10-expressing cells of the offspring, Cre should excise both the `loxP-stop-loxP` cassette and the `lox2272-stop-lox2272` cassette.\n    5.  **Observation:** The offspring show no green signal, meaning the Receptor-eGFP fusion protein is not being produced or is not fluorescent.\n\n*   **Evaluation of the potential causes:**\n    *   **The key question is: what happens after Cre removes the `lox2272-stop-lox2272` cassette?** The recombination event excises the DNA between the two lox2272 sites, but it leaves one copy of the 34-base-pair lox2272 site behind. This 34 bp sequence is inserted directly between the end of the receptor's coding sequence (C-terminus) and the start of the eGFP's coding sequence.\n    *   **The problem of frameshift:** For a fusion protein to be made correctly, the reading frame must be maintained across the junction. This means any inserted DNA must have a length that is a multiple of 3 base pairs (to code for a whole number of amino acids). The residual lox2272 site is 34 bp long. Since 34 is not divisible by 3 (34 = 11 x 3 + 1), this insertion causes a frameshift.\n    *   **Consequence of the frameshift:** When the ribosome translates the mRNA, it will correctly translate the receptor portion. When it reaches the part of the mRNA transcribed from the lox2272 site, it will translate the first 11 codons, but then the reading frame will be shifted for the rest of the transcript. This means the eGFP part of the message will be read incorrectly, producing a string of nonsense amino acids. A stop codon is almost certain to be encountered very quickly in this incorrect frame, terminating translation prematurely. The result is that a functional eGFP fluorophore is never synthesized. This perfectly explains a complete lack of green signal.\n\n*   **Analysis of the given options:**\n    *   A) the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi: This would imply that the protein is synthesized correctly but fails to traffic. This might result in a faint, mislocalized signal, not a complete absence of signal. Furthermore, if misfolding is severe, the protein may be degraded, but a frameshift is a more fundamental synthesis error.\n    *   B) ligand and the receptor are in a paracrine relationship: This describes the biological function of the proteins, which is what the experiment aims to study. It does not explain a failure in the experimental reporter system itself.\n    *   C) the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing: This is incorrect. The construct uses the strong, exogenous CBA promoter, which was shown to be functional in the astrocyte transfection experiment.\n    *   D) the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame: This accurately describes the consequence of the 34 bp lox2272 site being left behind after recombination. The frameshift mutation prevents the correct translation of the eGFP portion of the fusion protein, explaining the lack of green signal.\n\n<<<D>>>"
