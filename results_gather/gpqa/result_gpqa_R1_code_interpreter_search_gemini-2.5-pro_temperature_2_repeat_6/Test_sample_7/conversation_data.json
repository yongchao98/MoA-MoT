As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n\nA) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nB) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nC) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1\nD) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n",

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct conclusion:\n\n**1. Analyze the Role of G2**\n\n*   **Single mutant `g2`:** The `g2` knockout mutant shows 0% resistance. This is the most severe phenotype possible, representing a complete loss of the resistance trait.\n*   **Double mutants with `g2`:** The `g1g2` double mutant and the `g2g3` double mutant also show 0% resistance.\n*   **Epistasis:** This pattern demonstrates epistasis. Epistasis occurs when the phenotype of one gene masks the phenotype of another gene.\n    *   The phenotype of `g2` (0% resistance) masks the phenotype of `g1` (75% resistance), because the `g1g2` double mutant has the `g2` phenotype.\n    *   Similarly, the phenotype of `g2` (0% resistance) masks the phenotype of `g3` (50% resistance), because the `g2g3` double mutant has the `g2` phenotype.\n*   **Conclusion about G2:** In a genetic pathway, the gene whose phenotype is seen in a double-mutant is considered \"epistatic\" and is typically upstream of the other gene. Since G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, and we know one of the genes is a transcription factor acting upstream, we can confidently conclude that **G2 is the upstream transcription factor**. Its function is essential for the entire resistance pathway. This eliminates option C, which suggests G1 is the transcription factor.\n\n**2. Analyze the Relationship between G1 and G3**\n\n*   **Single mutants `g1` and `g3`:**\n    *   `g1` knockout causes a 25% loss in resistance (100% -> 75%).\n    *   `g3` knockout causes a 50% loss in resistance (100% -> 50%).\n    *   This tells us both genes contribute to the final resistance level, and G3's contribution seems to be larger than G1's.\n*   **Double mutant `g1g3`:**\n    *   The resistance of the `g1g3` double mutant is 10%. This means a loss of 90% resistance.\n*   **Analyzing the interaction:**\n    *   If the genes acted in completely independent, additive pathways, we would expect the total loss of resistance to be the sum of the individual losses: 25% loss (from `g1`) + 50% loss (from `g3`) = 75% total loss. This would result in 25% remaining resistance.\n    *   However, the observed resistance is only 10% (a 90% loss). The combined effect of knocking out both genes is much greater than the sum of their individual effects. This is a classic example of a **synergistic interaction**, also known as synthetic enhancement.\n    *   This synergy strongly suggests that G1 and G3 have overlapping or **redundant functions**. They likely act in parallel pathways that both contribute to the overall resistance. When one pathway is disabled, the other can partially compensate. When both are disabled, the system fails almost completely. The term **\"gene redundancy\"** accurately describes this type of relationship. This conclusion favors option A over option B (\"pleiotropy,\" which means one gene affects multiple traits) and option D (\"same promoter,\" which is a specific mechanism not directly proven by these results).\n\n**3. Evaluate the Final Options**\n\nBased on our analysis:\n*   G2 is the upstream transcription factor.\n*   G1 and G3 exhibit a synergistic interaction, which is well described as gene redundancy.\n\nLet's look at the options again:\n*   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   \"G2 is a transcription factor\": Correct.\n    *   \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\": Correct. This is the best description of the synergistic interaction.\n    *   \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\": This part is technically incorrect based on a classical definition of epistasis, as the double mutant has a novel, more severe phenotype rather than the phenotype of `g1`. However, the first two parts of this option are strongly supported by the data.\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   \"Pleiotropy\" is incorrect. We are only measuring one trait (resistance).\n*   **C) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   \"G1 is a transcription factor\" is incorrect.\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   \"has the same promoter\" is a possible mechanism but not the best functional conclusion from this data. \"Gene redundancy\" is a better description. Also, \"G3 is epistatic towards G1\" is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOption A contains the two most accurate and significant conclusions that can be drawn from the experiment: G2 is the transcription factor, and G1 and G3 have redundant functions. Despite the final clause being imprecise, Option A is overwhelmingly the best choice because the other options contain clear and fundamental errors.\n\n<<<A>>>"
