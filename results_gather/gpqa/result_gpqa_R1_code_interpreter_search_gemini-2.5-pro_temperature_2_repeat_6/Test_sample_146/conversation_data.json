    "Annihilation is a process in which a particle and its corresponding antiparticle collide and their mass is converted into energy, in accordance with Einstein's mass-energy equivalence principle ($E=mc^2$). In this specific problem, a proton ($p$) and a slowly moving antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) annihilate to produce four new particles, two $A^+$ and two $A^-$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the velocity of particle A:\n\n**1. Initial State Analysis and Conservation of Energy**\nThe initial system consists of a proton and an antiproton. The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving.\" This is a common way to describe annihilation at rest, where the initial kinetic energy is negligible compared to the rest mass energy. We can therefore assume the total initial momentum is zero, and the total initial energy ($E_i$) is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n\nThe rest mass of a proton ($m_p$) is equal to the rest mass of an antiproton ($m_{\\bar{p}}$). The rest mass energy of a proton is approximately 938.27 MeV.\n\n$E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2$\n$E_i = 2 \\times 938.27 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.54 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**2. Final State Analysis**\nThe final state consists of four particles: $2A^+$ and $2A^-$. They all have the same mass, $m_A$, with a rest energy of $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\nDue to the conservation of momentum (initial momentum is zero), the four final particles must fly apart in such a way that their total momentum is also zero. By symmetry, the most straightforward outcome is that the available energy is distributed equally among the four particles. This means they will all have the same total energy ($E_A$) and the same speed ($v$).\n\nThe total final energy ($E_f$) is the sum of the total energies of the four A particles:\n$E_f = 4 \\times E_A$\n\nThe total energy of a single moving particle A is given by the relativistic formula:\n$E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n**3. Applying the Conservation of Energy Principle**\nThe total energy before the annihilation must equal the total energy after.\n$E_i = E_f$\n$1876.54 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\times E_A$\n$1876.54 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\times (\\gamma m_A c^2)$\n\nWe are given $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$, so we can substitute this value into the equation:\n$1876.54 = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times 300$\n$1876.54 = 1200 \\gamma$\n\n**4. Solving for the Velocity**\nFirst, we solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1876.54}{1200} \\approx 1.5638$\n\nNow, we use the definition of the Lorentz factor to solve for the velocity, $v$.\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n$1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nSubstitute the calculated value of $\\gamma$:\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n$v/c \\approx 0.7688$\n\nSo, the velocity of particle A is $v \\approx 0.77c$. This corresponds to option B.\n\nWe can perform this calculation using a Python script for precision.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nm_p_c2 = 938.27  # Rest energy of proton in MeV\nm_A_c2 = 300.0   # Rest energy of particle A in MeV\n\n# 1. Calculate total initial energy\nE_initial = 2 * m_p_c2\n\n# 2. Calculate total final energy in terms of gamma\n# E_final = 4 * gamma * m_A_c2\n# From E_initial = E_final, we have 2 * m_p_c2 = 4 * gamma * m_A_c2\n\n# 3. Solve for gamma\ngamma = (2 * m_p_c2) / (4 * m_A_c2)\n\n# 4. Solve for v/c from gamma\n# gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)\n# => (v/c)^2 = 1 - 1/gamma^2\nv_over_c_squared = 1 - (1 / (gamma**2))\nv_over_c = math.sqrt(v_over_c_squared)\n\nprint(f\"The velocity of particle A is {v_over_c:.2f}c\")\n```\nThe python code execution result is:\nThe velocity of particle A is 0.77c\n\nThe calculated velocity is approximately 0.77c.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Annihilation is a process where a particle collides with its antiparticle, converting their mass into energy, which then materializes into other particles. To solve this problem, we will use the principles of conservation of energy and momentum in the context of special relativity.\n\n**1. Initial State Energy Calculation**\n\n*   The initial system consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n*   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving.\" This implies that its initial kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. We can therefore assume the annihilation happens \"at rest,\" meaning the total initial momentum is approximately zero.\n*   The total initial energy ($E_{\\text{initial}}$) is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton. The rest mass of a proton is equal to that of an antiproton.\n*   The rest energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) is approximately 938.27 MeV.\n*   $E_{\\text{initial}} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2$\n*   $E_{\\text{initial}} = 2 \\times 938.27 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.54 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**2. Final State Energy and Momentum**\n\n*   The final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. Since $A^+$ and $A^-$ are a particle-antiparticle pair, they have the same mass, $m_A$. We are given $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   According to the principle of conservation of momentum, since the initial momentum was zero, the total momentum of the four final particles must also be zero.\n*   Due to the symmetry of the products (four particles of identical mass), the conserved initial energy will be distributed equally among them. This means each particle A will have the same total energy ($E_A$) and, consequently, the same speed ($v$).\n*   The total final energy ($E_{\\text{final}}$) is the sum of the energies of the four A particles:\n    $E_{\\text{final}} = 4 \\times E_A$\n\n**3. Applying Conservation of Energy and Relativistic Formulas**\n\n*   The total energy of a single relativistic particle is given by $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is defined as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$.\n*   By the conservation of energy principle, $E_{\\text{initial}} = E_{\\text{final}}$.\n*   $1876.54 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\times (\\gamma m_A c^2)$\n*   Substitute the given rest energy of particle A ($m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$):\n    $1876.54 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times (300 \\text{ MeV})$\n    $1876.54 = 1200 \\gamma$\n\n**4. Solving for Velocity (v)**\n\n*   First, we solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1876.54}{1200} \\approx 1.5638$\n*   Next, we use the definition of $\\gamma$ to solve for the velocity, $v$.\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n    $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n    $1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n*   Now, we plug in our calculated value for $\\gamma$:\n    $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}}$\n    $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}}$\n    $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089}$\n    $v/c = \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n    $v/c \\approx 0.7688$\n\nThe velocity of particle A is approximately 0.77 times the speed of light. Comparing this to the options:\n\nA) 0.86c\nB) 0.77c\nC) 0.96c\nD) 0.91c\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
