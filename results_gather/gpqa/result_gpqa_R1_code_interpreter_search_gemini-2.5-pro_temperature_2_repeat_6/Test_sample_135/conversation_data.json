    "This problem asks for the evaluation of the volume integral of the divergence of a given vector field, `∇.f`, within a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\nThe vector field `f` is given by:\n`f(r) = (1/r^2) * r̂`\nwhere `r` is the radial distance from the origin and `r̂` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\nThe integral to be evaluated is:\n`I = ∫∫∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`\nwhere `V` is the volume of the sphere of radius `R`.\n\nThis problem can be elegantly solved using the Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem), which states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume `V` is equal to the outward flux of the vector field through the closed surface `S` that bounds the volume `V`.\n\n`∫∫∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\nHere, the volume `V` is the sphere of radius `R`, and its bounding surface `S` is the surface of this sphere.\n\nLet's evaluate the surface integral on the right-hand side.\n1.  **Vector Field on the Surface:** On the surface of the sphere, the radial distance `r` is constant and equal to the radius `R`. So the vector field on the surface is:\n    `f(r=R) = (1/R^2) * r̂`\n\n2.  **Differential Surface Area Element:** For a sphere, the differential surface area element `dS` points radially outward. In spherical coordinates, it is given by:\n    `dS = r̂ * dS = r̂ * R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n    where `θ` is the polar angle (from 0 to π) and `φ` is the azimuthal angle (from 0 to 2π).\n\n3.  **Dot Product:** Now we compute the dot product `f ⋅ dS`:\n    `f ⋅ dS = [(1/R^2) * r̂] ⋅ [r̂ * R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ]`\n    Since `r̂` is a unit vector, `r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1`. The `R^2` terms cancel out.\n    `f ⋅ dS = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n4.  **Surface Integral:** Now we integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere by integrating over the full range of `θ` and `φ`.\n    `∮∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_(φ=0)^(2π) ∫_(θ=0)^π sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\nLet's evaluate the integral. We can separate the variables:\n`∫_(φ=0)^(2π) dφ * ∫_(θ=0)^π sin(θ) dθ`\n\nThe integral with respect to `θ` is:\n`∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\nThe integral with respect to `φ` is:\n`∫_0^(2π) dφ = [φ]_0^(2π) = 2π - 0 = 2π`\n\nMultiplying the results:\n`∮∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = (2π) * (2) = 4π`\n\nTherefore, by the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence of the field is `4π`.\n\n`I = ∫∫∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`\n\n**Alternative Method (Direct Calculation):**\nThe divergence of the field `f(r) = r̂/r^2` in spherical coordinates is `∇ ⋅ (r̂/r^2) = 4πδ³(r)`, where `δ³(r)` is the three-dimensional Dirac delta function. This signifies that the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, where there is a point source.\nThe integral becomes:\n`I = ∫∫∫_V 4πδ³(r) dV`\nSince the volume of integration (a sphere of radius `R`) includes the origin (where the delta function is non-zero), the integral evaluates to the value of the function multiplying the delta function, which is `4π`.\n`I = 4π`\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 0\nB) 4 π\nC) 1\nD) 4/3 π R\n\nThe calculated answer is `4π`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
