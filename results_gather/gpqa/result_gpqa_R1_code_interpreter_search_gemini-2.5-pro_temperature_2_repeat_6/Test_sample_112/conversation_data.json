    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The peak is very broad due to hydrogen bonding. While alcohols also have O-H stretches, they are typically less broad than those of carboxylic acids and appear at higher wavenumbers (around 3200-3600 cm⁻¹).\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the region for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, a C=O stretch for a carboxylic acid is typically found at 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The combination of the broad O-H peak and the C=O peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. The peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ confirms an alkene is also present.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the NMR spectrum explicitly confirms the existence of an alkene in the molecule's structure, which corroborates the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a crucial piece of evidence. We need to determine the possible composition of a fragment with this mass-to-charge ratio. The most common and chemically relevant fragment with m/z = 45 is the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺.\n        *   Mass of [COOH]⁺ = Mass(C) + 2 * Mass(O) + Mass(H) = 12 + 2*16 + 1 = 45.\n    *   This fragment is very common in the mass spectra of carboxylic acids due to the cleavage of the bond adjacent to the carbonyl group. This finding provides strong support for the conclusion that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Chemical Formulas:**\n    *   From the combined spectral data, we have deduced that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. It contains both a C=C double bond and a -COOH group.\n    *   Now, we must determine which of the proposed molecular formulas fits this structural description. We can use the **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)** for this. The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n    *   A C=C double bond accounts for one degree of unsaturation.\n    *   A C=O double bond (within the carboxylic acid) accounts for another degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, our target molecule must have a total **DoU of at least 2**. It must also have **two oxygen atoms** to form the carboxylic acid group.\n\n5.  **Calculate the DoU for each option:**\n    *   **A) C6H10O2:**\n        *   Contains two oxygen atoms, which is consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n        *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This DoU of 2 perfectly accommodates one C=C bond and one C=O bond. This is a very strong candidate.\n    *   **B) C6H12O:**\n        *   Contains only one oxygen, so it cannot be a carboxylic acid.\n        *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This DoU is insufficient for both a C=C and a C=O bond.\n    *   **C) C6H10O:**\n        *   Contains only one oxygen, so it cannot be a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **D) C6H12O2:**\n        *   Contains two oxygen atoms, so it could be a carboxylic acid.\n        *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This DoU only allows for one double bond. If the compound is a carboxylic acid (with a C=O), it cannot also have a C=C double bond. This contradicts the FTIR and NMR data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of all spectral data, the only molecular formula that accommodates all the required features—a carboxylic acid group (requiring 2 oxygens and 1 DoU for the C=O) and an alkene group (requiring 1 DoU for the C=C)—is **C6H10O2**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
