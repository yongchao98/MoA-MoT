    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Structure of Compound X from Spectroscopic Data**\n\n*   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This very broad signal is the classic signature of the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid that has formed hydrogen-bonded dimers.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This peak is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch, and its position is consistent with that of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **1610 cm⁻¹ & 1450 cm⁻¹:** These absorptions suggest the presence of C=C bonds within an aromatic (benzene) ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A very downfield, broad singlet for one proton is definitive for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This confirms the IR analysis.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region are a classic A₂B₂ pattern, indicating a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the two protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group. The more upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm corresponds to the two protons ortho to the other substituent.\n    *   **Analysis of the Alkyl Substituent:**\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂). This is an ethyl fragment starter: -CH₂-CH₃.\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons suggests a methylene group (-CH₂) adjacent to multiple different types of protons (likely the -CH₃ at 0.9 ppm and the -CH at 2.9 ppm).\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton, located at a relatively downfield position for an aliphatic proton, suggests it is a benzylic proton (a C-H group attached directly to the benzene ring). Its multiplet nature indicates it is adjacent to several protons.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure of Compound X:**\n    1.  Start with the para-disubstituted benzene ring with a -COOH group.\n    2.  Assemble the alkyl chain: We have fragments for -CH₂CH₃ and -CH(CH₃). The only way to connect these and have them attached to the ring via a single carbon is to form a **sec-butyl group**: -CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃.\n    3.  Let's verify the sec-butyl group with the NMR data:\n        *   The benzylic -CH is coupled to the adjacent -CH₃ and -CH₂, explaining the multiplet at 2.9 ppm.\n        *   The -CH₂- group is coupled to the benzylic -CH and the terminal -CH₃, explaining the multiplet at 1.7 ppm.\n        *   The -CH₃ attached to the benzylic carbon is only coupled to the -CH, explaining the doublet at 1.4 ppm.\n        *   The terminal -CH₃ is only coupled to the -CH₂-, explaining the triplet at 0.9 ppm.\n    4.  The complete structure for **Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option (C), but this is the reactant, not the final product.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Reaction and Predict the Product**\n\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is carried out with red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (Red P / HI).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This combination of reagents is a powerful reducing agent used for the complete reduction of various functional groups, including carboxylic acids, to alkanes. It will reduce the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) all the way down to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   **Transformation:** The -COOH group on the benzene ring will be converted to a -CH₃ group. The rest of the molecule, the sec-butyl group and the benzene ring, will remain unchanged as they are already fully reduced alkanes/arenes.\n*   **Structure of the Final Product:** Starting with 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid and reducing the -COOH group to -CH₃ yields **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n**Step 3: Match the Product with the Given Options**\n\n*   The predicted final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n*   Let's check the options:\n    *   A) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\n    *   B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid\n    *   C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (This is the starting material)\n    *   D) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene\n\nThe calculated product directly matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
