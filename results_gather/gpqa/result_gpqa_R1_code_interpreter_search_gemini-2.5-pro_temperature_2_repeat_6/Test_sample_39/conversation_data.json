    "This is a classic piece of organic chemistry lab slang. Let's break down why one option is much more likely than the others.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Context:** The setting is a synthetic organic chemistry lab. A primary activity in such a lab is synthesizing a target compound and then purifying it from unreacted starting materials, reagents, and byproducts.\n2.  **Purification Technique:** The most common purification technique for non-volatile organic compounds is **column chromatography**. A simpler, related technique used to quickly check a reaction mixture and plan a purification is **Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC)**.\n3.  **How Chromatography Works:** In both TLC and column chromatography (specifically, normal-phase), a mixture of compounds is applied to a stationary phase (like silica gel, which is very polar). A solvent (the mobile phase) is then used to move the compounds. Compounds separate based on their **polarity**.\n    *   More polar compounds \"stick\" more tightly to the polar silica gel and move more slowly.\n    *   Less polar compounds interact less with the silica gel and are carried along by the solvent more quickly.\n4.  **The Meaning of \"On Top of Each Other\":**\n    *   On a **TLC plate**, the separated compounds appear as distinct spots. If two compounds have very similar polarities, they will travel up the plate at almost the same rate, and their spots will overlap or be right \"on top of each other\".\n    *   In **column chromatography**, the same principle applies. If two compounds have similar polarities, they will move down the column at the same rate and will elute (come out of the column) at the same time, making it impossible to separate them. Their \"bands\" within the column are \"on top of each other\".\n5.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) Non-covalent/van der Waals interactions:** While these forces are the fundamental reason *why* compounds have different polarities and boiling points, the phrase itself doesn't refer to this fundamental principle. It refers to the practical outcome of a failed separation.\n    *   **B) Similar optical rotations:** Optical rotation is a property of chiral molecules used for characterization, not typically for separation (except in specialized chiral chromatography). Two compounds could have very different polarities (and thus be easy to separate) but happen to have similar optical rotations. This is not the common meaning of the phrase.\n    *   **C) Similar polarities:** This is the most direct cause of the problem described. If the compounds have similar polarities, they will fail to separate during chromatography, the most common purification method. This perfectly explains why they would be \"on top of each other\" on a TLC plate or co-eluting from a column.\n    *   **D) Similar boiling points:** This would make the compounds difficult to separate by **distillation**. While this is a valid purification problem, the phrase \"on top of each other\" is much more evocative of the visual result in chromatography than the outcome of a distillation.\n\n**Conclusion:** The phrase \"on top of each other\" is lab jargon for a failed separation, most commonly via chromatography. The property that governs separation in this technique is polarity.\n\n<<<C>>>"
