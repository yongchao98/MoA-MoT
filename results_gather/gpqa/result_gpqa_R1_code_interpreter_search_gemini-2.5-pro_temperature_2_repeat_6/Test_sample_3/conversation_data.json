    "*   **Initial State (Our Universe): Maxwell's Equations**\n    Let's first recall the standard four Maxwell's equations in differential form, as they describe electromagnetism in our universe.\n    1.  **Gauss's Law for Electricity:** ∇ ⋅ **E** = ρ / ε₀\n        *   *Meaning:* The divergence (outflow from a point) of the electric field (**E**) is proportional to the density of electric charge (ρ). This is why electric field lines start on positive charges and end on negative charges.\n    2.  **Gauss's Law for Magnetism:** ∇ ⋅ **B** = 0\n        *   *Meaning:* The divergence of the magnetic field (**B**) is zero. This is the mathematical statement that there are no magnetic monopoles (isolated North or South poles). Magnetic field lines always form closed loops.\n    3.  **Faraday's Law of Induction:** ∇ × **E** = -∂**B**/∂t\n        *   *Meaning:* The curl (circulation around a point) of the electric field (**E**) is caused by a time-varying magnetic field (**B**).\n    4.  **Ampère-Maxwell Law:** ∇ × **B** = μ₀(**J** + ε₀ ∂**E**/∂t)\n        *   *Meaning:* The curl (circulation) of the magnetic field (**B**) is caused by an electric current (**J**) and a time-varying electric field (**E**).\n\n*   **Hypothetical State (Universe with Magnetic Monopoles)**\n    Now, let's introduce the \"magnetic monopole,\" an isolated North or South pole. We can think of this as a \"magnetic charge\" (let's denote its density by ρ_m). The existence of this new entity would require us to modify the equations to account for it, typically by making the equations symmetric with respect to electric and magnetic phenomena.\n\n*   **Analyzing the Impact on Each Equation:**\n    1.  **Gauss's Law for Electricity (∇ ⋅ E = ρ / ε₀):** This equation deals with electric charges. The existence of magnetic charges does not change the fact that electric charges are the sources of diverging electric fields. So, this equation remains **unchanged**.\n\n    2.  **Gauss's Law for Magnetism (∇ ⋅ B = 0):** This equation explicitly states there are *no* magnetic monopoles. If monopoles exist, they must be the source of a diverging magnetic field, just as electric charges are for an electric field. Therefore, this equation **must change**. The right side will no longer be zero but will be proportional to the magnetic charge density (e.g., ∇ ⋅ **B** = μ₀ρ_m). This equation is related to the **divergence of the magnetic field**.\n\n    3.  **Faraday's Law of Induction (∇ × E = -∂B/∂t):** In our universe, only a changing magnetic field creates a circulating electric field. However, in a symmetric universe, a flow of magnetic charges (a \"magnetic current\", let's call it **J**_m) would also have to create a circulating electric field, just as an electric current (**J**) creates a circulating magnetic field. So, we must add a magnetic current term to this law. The equation **must change** to something like ∇ × **E** = -∂**B**/∂t - μ₀**J**_m. This equation is related to the **circulation (curl) of the electric field**.\n\n    4.  **Ampère-Maxwell Law (∇ × B = ...):** This law describes the sources of a circulating magnetic field: electric currents and changing electric fields. The existence of static magnetic charges or magnetic currents does not alter these sources. So, this equation remains **unchanged**.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The two equations that would be different are Gauss's Law for Magnetism (related to the **divergence of the magnetic field**) and Faraday's Law of Induction (related to the **circulation of the electric field**).\n\n    This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
