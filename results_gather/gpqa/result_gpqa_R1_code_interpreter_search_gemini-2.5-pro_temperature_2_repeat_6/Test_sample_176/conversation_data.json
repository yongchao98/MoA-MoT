    "Here's my thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Goal:** The primary objective is to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 ($L_1$) to the luminosity of Star_2 ($L_2$). This can be written as finding the value of $L_1 / L_2$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Relevant Physics Principles:**\n    *   The problem states the stars radiate as \"black bodies\". This is a crucial piece of information that points towards two fundamental laws of physics:\n        *   **The Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** This law relates a black body's total energy radiated per unit surface area per unit time to its temperature. The total luminosity (L), which is the total energy radiated per unit time, is given by $L = A \\cdot \\sigma T^4$, where $A$ is the surface area and $T$ is the surface temperature. For a spherical star, the area is $A = 4\\pi R^2$. So, the formula becomes $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$.\n        *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates the temperature of a black body to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation ($\\lambda_{max}$). The formula is $\\lambda_{max} = b/T$, where $b$ is Wien's displacement constant.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:**\n    Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, I can write the luminosities for both stars:\n    *   $L_1 = 4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4$\n    *   $L_2 = 4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4$\n\n    To find the ratio $L_1 / L_2$, I'll divide the first equation by the second:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4}$\n\n    The constants $4\\pi$ and $\\sigma$ cancel out, leaving:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4$\n\n4.  **Analyze the Given Information and Substitute:**\n    *   The problem states: \"Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2\". This means $\\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5$.\n    *   The information about mass ($M_1 = 1.5 M_2$) is extra data not needed for this particular calculation method, so I can ignore it.\n    *   Now my equation becomes: $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4$.\n    *   To get the final answer, I need to find the ratio of the temperatures, $\\frac{T_1}{T_2}$.\n\n5.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio:**\n    *   This is the trickiest part of the problem. The information given is: \"the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same\". The phrase \"appeared brightest\" refers to the *observed* peak wavelength, let's call it $\\lambda_{obs}$. So, $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$.\n    *   However, the temperature of a star, as used in the Stefan-Boltzmann and Wien's laws, is an intrinsic property. It is related to the *rest-frame* peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{rest}$), i.e., the wavelength you would measure if you were stationary relative to the star.\n    *   The observed wavelength and rest wavelength are connected by the Doppler effect, which depends on the star's radial velocity ($v_r$). A positive radial velocity indicates the star is moving away from the observer (redshift), and a negative velocity means it's moving towards the observer (blueshift).\n    *   Let's analyze each star:\n        *   **Star_1:** Has a radial velocity $v_{r1} = 0$. This means there is no Doppler shift. Therefore, its observed peak wavelength is equal to its rest-frame peak wavelength: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{rest,1}$.\n        *   **Star_2:** Has a radial velocity $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s. Since this is positive, the star is moving away from us, and its light is redshifted. The observed wavelength will be longer than the rest wavelength. The formula for the Doppler shift (for speeds much less than the speed of light, which is true here) is $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{rest} (1 + v_r/c)$. So, for Star_2: $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{rest,2} (1 + v_{r2}/c)$.\n\n    *   Now I can use the condition that the observed wavelengths are equal:\n        $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$\n        $\\lambda_{rest,1} = \\lambda_{rest,2} (1 + v_{r2}/c)$\n\n    *   Next, I apply Wien's Law ($\\lambda_{rest} = b/T$) to relate these rest wavelengths to the stars' intrinsic temperatures:\n        $\\frac{b}{T_1} = \\frac{b}{T_2} (1 + \\frac{v_{r2}}{c})$\n\n    *   The constant $b$ cancels out. Rearranging the equation to find the temperature ratio $\\frac{T_1}{T_2}$:\n        $\\frac{1}{T_1} = \\frac{1}{T_2} (1 + \\frac{v_{r2}}{c})$\n        $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = 1 + \\frac{v_{r2}}{c}$\n        $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_{r2}/c}$\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:**\n    Now I have all the pieces. I can substitute the temperature ratio back into my luminosity ratio equation:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + v_{r2}/c} \\right)^4$\n\n    I will now plug in the numerical values to get the final answer. I'll use Python for a precise calculation.\n    *   $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s\n    *   $c$ (speed of light) $\\approx 299792.458$ km/s\n\n```python\nR_ratio_squared = 1.5**2\nv_radial_2 = 700.0  # km/s\nc_light_speed = 299792.458  # km/s\n\n# Calculate the term (1 + v/c)\ndoppler_factor = 1 + (v_radial_2 / c_light_speed)\n\n# Calculate the final luminosity ratio L1/L2\nluminosity_ratio = R_ratio_squared / (doppler_factor**4)\n\nprint(luminosity_ratio)\n```\n```output\n2.2290483478988636\n```\n7.  **Conclusion:** The calculated luminosity ratio is approximately 2.229. Comparing this to the given options:\n    A) ~2.32\n    B) ~2.35\n    C) ~2.23\n    D) ~2.25\n\n    My result, ~2.23, matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The user wants me to find the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nI need to calculate the ratio $L_1 / L_2$.\n\n**2. Identify the Relevant Physics Principles:**\n*   **Luminosity of a Black Body:** The problem states the stars radiate as black bodies. The luminosity (L) of a spherical black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\n    where R is the star's radius, T is its surface temperature, and $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n*   **Peak Wavelength and Temperature:** The temperature of a black body is related to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation ($\\lambda_{rest}$) by Wien's Displacement Law:\n    $\\lambda_{rest} = b/T$\n    where b is Wien's displacement constant. Note that this $\\lambda$ is the rest-frame wavelength, i.e., the wavelength measured by an observer stationary with respect to the star.\n\n*   **Doppler Effect:** The observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) is different from the rest wavelength ($\\lambda_{rest}$) if the star has a radial velocity ($v_r$) relative to the observer. The relationship is:\n    $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{rest} (1 + v_r/c)$\n    where c is the speed of light. A positive $v_r$ means the star is moving away (redshift).\n\n**3. Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:**\nLet's write the luminosity for each star and then find their ratio:\n$L_1 = 4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4$\n$L_2 = 4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4$\n\nDividing the first equation by the second, the constants ($4\\pi$ and $\\sigma$) cancel out:\n$\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4$\n\n**4. Substitute Known Values:**\n*   **Radius Ratio:** We are given that $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$. Therefore, the ratio $(R_1/R_2) = 1.5$.\n    The equation becomes:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4$\n    To solve this, I need to find the ratio of the temperatures, $T_1/T_2$. The mass information is not needed for this calculation.\n\n**5. Determine the Temperature Ratio ($T_1/T_2$):**\nThis requires using the information about the peak wavelengths.\n*   The problem states the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$.\n*   Let's relate the observed wavelength to the rest wavelength for each star using the Doppler effect:\n    *   For Star_1: $v_{r1} = 0$, so there is no Doppler shift. $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{rest,1}$.\n    *   For Star_2: $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s. The light is redshifted. $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{rest,2} (1 + v_{r2}/c)$.\n*   Since $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$:\n    $\\lambda_{rest,1} = \\lambda_{rest,2} (1 + v_{r2}/c)$\n*   Now, use Wien's Law ($\\lambda_{rest} = b/T$) to replace the rest wavelengths with temperatures:\n    $\\frac{b}{T_1} = \\frac{b}{T_2} (1 + \\frac{v_{r2}}{c})$\n*   The constant $b$ cancels. We can rearrange to find the temperature ratio:\n    $\\frac{1}{T_1} = \\frac{1}{T_2} (1 + \\frac{v_{r2}}{c}) \\implies \\frac{T_2}{T_1} = 1 + \\frac{v_{r2}}{c}$\n    Therefore, the ratio we need is:\n    $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_{r2}/c}$\n\n**6.

    "The Stefan-Boltzmann law states that the luminosity (L) of a star is proportional to the square of its radius (R) and the fourth power of its surface temperature (T):\n$L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\n\nTo find the ratio of the luminosities of Star 1 and Star 2, we can set up the following equation:\n$\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4$\n\nFrom the problem, we are given that $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$, so the radius ratio is:\n$\\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5$\nSquaring this gives:\n$\\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25$\n\nNext, we need to find the temperature ratio ($T_1/T_2$). Wien's Displacement Law relates a star's temperature to the peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{rest}$) at which it radiates, as measured in its own rest frame:\n$T = \\frac{b}{\\lambda_{rest}}$, where b is Wien's constant.\nThis means that the temperature ratio is inversely proportional to the ratio of their rest-frame peak wavelengths:\n$\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{rest,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,1}}$\n\nThe problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths ($\\lambda_{obs}$) are the same for both stars. We must account for the Doppler effect due to the stars' radial velocities. The observed wavelength is related to the rest wavelength by:\n$\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{rest} \\left(1 + \\frac{v_r}{c}\\right)$, where $v_r$ is the radial velocity and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nFor Star 1: $v_{r1} = 0$, so $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{rest,1}$.\nFor Star 2: $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s, so $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{rest,2} \\left(1 + \\frac{v_{r2}}{c}\\right)$.\n\nSince $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$, we have:\n$\\lambda_{rest,1} = \\lambda_{rest,2} \\left(1 + \\frac{v_{r2}}{c}\\right)$\n\nNow we can find the ratio of the rest-frame wavelengths:\n$\\frac{\\lambda_{rest,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{v_{r2}}{c}}$\n\nSince $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{rest,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,1}}$, the temperature ratio is:\n$\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{v_{r2}}{c}}$\n\nFinally, we can substitute all the parts back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n$\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (2.25) \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{v_{r2}}{c}}\\right)^4 = \\frac{2.25}{\\left(1 + \\frac{v_{r2}}{c}\\right)^4}$\n\nThe python code executed this calculation:\n$v_{r2} = 700$ km/s\n$c \\approx 299792.458$ km/s\n$\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{2.25}{\\left(1 + \\frac{700}{299792.458}\\right)^4} \\approx 2.2291$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the result is 2.23.\n\n<<<C>>>"
