    "This problem involves the properties of radioactive decay, which follows an exponential distribution. A key characteristic of this distribution is that it is \"memoryless\". This means the probability of an event occurring in a future interval is independent of the past. In this context, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes does not change its intrinsic probability of decaying in any future time interval.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Define the decay probability:**\n    The probability `P(t)` that an atom decays within a time `t` is given by the formula:\n    `P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\n    where `λ` is the decay constant.\n\n    The probability of survival until time `t` is `e^(-λt)`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the decay constant (λ) from the given information:**\n    We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%.\n    `P(100) = 0.32`\n    `1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`\n    `e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32`\n    `e^(-100λ) = 0.68`\n\n    We don't need to solve for `λ` explicitly yet. This relationship is sufficient.\n\n3.  **Apply the memoryless property:**\n    The question asks for the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes. Because radioactive decay is a memoryless process, the history of the atom does not affect its future decay probability. Therefore, the problem simplifies to finding the probability that a *new* atom of the same type would decay within 150 minutes.\n\n4.  **Calculate the required probability:**\n    We need to calculate `P(150)`, the probability of decay within 150 minutes.\n    `P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`\n\n    To find the value of `e^(-150λ)`, we can use the relationship we found in step 2:\n    From `e^(-100λ) = 0.68`, we can write `e^(-150λ)` as `(e^(-100λ))^(150/100)` or `(e^(-100λ))^1.5`.\n\n    So, `e^(-150λ) = 0.68^1.5`.\n\n    Now, we can perform the final calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# We want to calculate the probability P = 1 - (0.68)^1.5\nprobability = 1 - math.pow(0.68, 1.5)\n\n# Convert to percentage\nprobability_percentage = probability * 100\n\nprint(f\"{probability_percentage:.1f}\")\n```\nThe calculated probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 44.1%. Comparing this with the given options:\nA) 48%\nB) 44%\nC) 40%\nD) 52%\n\nThe closest answer is 44%.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem describes a radioactive decay process, which follows an exponential probability distribution. A key feature of such processes is that they are \"memoryless.\" This means that the probability of the atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already survived.\n\n1.  **Model the Decay Process:**\n    The probability of an atom surviving for a time `t` is given by the survival function `S(t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant.\n    The probability of an atom decaying within a time `t` is `P(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n2.  **Use the Given Information to Find λ:**\n    We are told that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, or 0.32.\n    `P(100) = 1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`\n    This means the probability of surviving for 100 minutes is:\n    `S(100) = e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n\n3.  **Determine the Required Probability:**\n    We need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes. Let `T` be the lifetime of the atom. We are looking for the conditional probability `P(T < 50 + 150 | T > 50)`.\n    Due to the memoryless property of exponential decay, this is equivalent to finding the probability that a new atom will decay within 150 minutes.\n    `P(T < 50 + 150 | T > 50) = P(T < 150)`\n    So, we need to calculate `P(150) = 1 - e^(-150λ)`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Result:**\n    We can find the value of `e^(-150λ)` using the relationship we found in step 2:\n    `e^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`\n    Substituting the value `e^(-100λ) = 0.68`:\n    `e^(-150λ) = (0.68)^1.5`\n    Now, we can calculate the probability of decay:\n    `P(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n\n    The previous Python code calculated this value:\n    `1 - (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`\n\n    Converting this probability to a percentage gives `43.93%`.\n\n5.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated probability is approximately 44%.\n    A) 48%\n    B) 44%\n    C) 40%\n    D) 52%\n\n    The closest option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
