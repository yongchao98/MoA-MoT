    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Decay Process:**\n    The problem describes the decay of a positive pion ($\\pi^+$) into a positive muon ($\\mu^+$) and a muon neutrino ($\\nu_\\mu$). The reaction is:\n    $\\pi^+ \\rightarrow \\mu^+ + \\nu_\\mu$\n\n2.  **State the Initial Conditions:**\n    *   The parent particle, the pion ($\\pi^+$), is stationary. This means its initial momentum is zero ($p_{initial} = 0$), and its initial kinetic energy is also zero ($KE_{initial} = 0$).\n    *   The total initial energy is therefore just its rest mass energy, $E_{initial} = m_{\\pi}c^2$.\n\n3.  **Apply Conservation Laws:**\n    This is a decay process, so we must apply the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.\n\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:**\n        The total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n        $p_{initial} = p_{final}$\n        $0 = \\vec{p}_{\\mu} + \\vec{p}_{\\nu}$\n        This implies that the momentum vectors of the muon and the neutrino are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction:\n        $\\vec{p}_{\\mu} = - \\vec{p}_{\\nu}$\n        So, their magnitudes are equal. Let's call this magnitude 'p':\n        $p_{\\mu} = p_{\\nu} = p$\n\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:**\n        The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n        $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n        $m_{\\pi}c^2 = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$\n        Where $E_{\\mu}$ and $E_{\\nu}$ are the total energies (rest mass energy + kinetic energy) of the muon and neutrino, respectively.\n\n4.  **Use Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\n    The relationship between a particle's total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is given by:\n    $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2$\n\n    *   For the muon ($\\mu^+$): $E_{\\mu} = \\sqrt{(p_{\\mu}c)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n    *   For the neutrino ($\\nu_\\mu$): Neutrinos have a very small mass, which is considered negligible in this context. We will assume the neutrino is massless ($m_{\\nu} = 0$).\n        Therefore, its energy is: $E_{\\nu} = \\sqrt{(p_{\\nu}c)^2 + (0)^2} = p_{\\nu}c = pc$.\n        Since its rest mass is zero, the neutrino's total energy is equal to its kinetic energy ($KE_{\\nu} = E_{\\nu}$).\n\n5.  **Solve for the Unknowns:**\n    Substitute the energy expressions back into the energy conservation equation:\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2} + pc$\n\n    Now, we solve for the momentum `pc`:\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n    Square both sides:\n    $(m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n    $(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n    The $(pc)^2$ terms on both sides cancel out:\n    $(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n    Rearrange to isolate `pc`:\n    $(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2 = 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc)$\n    $pc = \\frac{(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}{2(m_{\\pi}c^2)}$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Numerical Values:**\n    Let's plug in the given rest mass energies:\n    *   $m_{\\pi}c^2 = 139.6$ MeV\n    *   $m_{\\mu}c^2 = 105.7$ MeV\n\nThe following python code calculates the final kinetic energies based on this formula.\n\n```python\n# Given rest masses (in MeV)\nm_pi = 139.6\nm_mu = 105.7\n\n# Calculate the momentum term (pc) using the derived formula\npc = (m_pi**2 - m_mu**2) / (2 * m_pi)\n\n# The kinetic energy of the massless neutrino is equal to its total energy, which is pc.\nKE_nu = pc\n\n# Calculate the total energy of the muon using the relativistic energy-momentum relation.\nE_mu = (pc**2 + m_mu**2)**0.5\n\n# The kinetic energy of the muon is its total energy minus its rest mass energy.\nKE_mu = E_mu - m_mu\n\n# Print the results rounded to two decimal places\n# The order in the final answer choices appears to be KE of muon, then KE of neutrino.\nprint(f\"KE of Muon: {KE_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"KE of Neutrino: {KE_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\n<execute_output>\nKE of Muon: 4.12 MeV\nKE of Neutrino: 29.79 MeV\n</execute_output>\n\nThe calculations show:\n*   Kinetic Energy of the muon ($\\mu^+$) is **4.12 MeV**.\n*   Kinetic Energy of the neutrino ($\\nu_\\mu$) is **29.79 MeV**, which can be rounded to **29.8 MeV**.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nB) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\nC) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\nD) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Decay Process:**\n    The problem describes the decay of a stationary positive pion ($\\pi^+$) into a positive muon ($\\mu^+$) and a muon neutrino ($\\nu$). The reaction is:\n    $\\pi^+ \\rightarrow \\mu^+ + \\nu$\n\n2.  **Apply Conservation Laws:**\n    Since the initial pion is stationary, we must conserve both energy and momentum starting from a state of rest.\n\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** The initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the final total momentum must also be zero. This means the two product particles, the muon ($\\mu^+$) and the neutrino ($\\nu$), must fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n        $p_{\\mu} = p_{\\nu} = p$\n\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:** The total initial energy is the rest energy of the pion ($m_{\\pi}c^2$), since it is stationary. This energy must be equal to the total energy of the two product particles.\n        $E_{\\pi} = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$\n        $m_{\\pi}c^2 = (KE_{\\mu} + m_{\\mu}c^2) + E_{\\nu}$\n\n3.  **Use Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\n    The total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) of a particle are related by the equation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2$.\n\n    *   For the **muon** ($\\mu^+$):\n        $E_{\\mu} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n\n    *   For the **neutrino** ($\\nu$): Neutrinos are considered massless (or have negligible mass) in such problems. For a massless particle, its total energy is simply $E_{\\nu} = pc$. Since its rest mass is zero, all its energy is kinetic energy, so $KE_{\\nu} = pc$.\n\n4.  **Solve for Momentum and Energy:**\n    Substitute the expressions for energy back into the conservation of energy equation:\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2} + pc$\n\n    We can now solve for the unknown momentum `pc`. Rearranging the equation:\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n\n    Square both sides:\n    $(m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n    $(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n\n    The $(pc)^2$ term cancels on both sides:\n    $(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) = (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n\n    Isolate `pc`:\n    $pc = \\frac{(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}{2(m_{\\pi}c^2)}$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Numerical Values:**\n    Given:\n    *   Rest mass of $\\pi^+$ ($m_{\\pi}c^2$) = 139.6 MeV\n    *   Rest mass of $\\mu^+$ ($m_{\\mu}c^2$) = 105.7 MeV\n\n    First, calculate `pc`, which is also the kinetic energy of the neutrino ($KE_{\\nu}$):\n    $pc = KE_{\\nu} = \\frac{(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2}{2 \\times 139.6}$\n    $KE_{\\nu} = \\frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{279.2}$\n    $KE_{\\nu} = \\frac{8315.67}{279.2} \\approx 29.78$ MeV\n\n    Now, find the total energy of the muon ($E_{\\mu}$):\n    From energy conservation:\n    $E_{\\mu} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - E_{\\nu}$\n    $E_{\\mu} = 139.6 - 29.78 = 109.82$ MeV\n\n    Finally, calculate the kinetic energy of the muon ($KE_{\\mu}$):\n    $KE_{\\mu} = E_{\\mu} - m_{\\mu}c^2$\n    $KE_{\\mu} = 109.82 - 105.7 = 4.12$ MeV\n\n    So, the kinetic energies of the product particles are:\n    *   $KE_{\\mu}$ = **4.12 MeV**\n    *   $KE_{\\nu}$ = **29.78 MeV** (which rounds to 29.8 MeV)\n\n    Comparing these results with the options:\n    A) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\n    B) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\n    C) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\n    D) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\n\n    The calculated values match option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
