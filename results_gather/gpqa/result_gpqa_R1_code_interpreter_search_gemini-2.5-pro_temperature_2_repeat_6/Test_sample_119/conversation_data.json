    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Fundamental Assumptions:**\n    *   The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ` (number of stars per unit volume), is a constant.\n    *   Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) to a star. The relationship is `plx = k/d`, where `k` is a constant. For simplicity in derivations, we often use `plx = 1/d` where `d` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds.\n\n2.  **Number of Stars in a Volume:**\n    *   Let's consider a thin spherical shell of radius `d` and thickness `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this shell (`dV`) is its surface area multiplied by its thickness: `dV = 4πd² * dd`.\n    *   Since the star density `ρ` is constant, the number of stars (`dN`) within this thin shell is the density multiplied by the volume of the shell:\n        `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n\n3.  **Relating Distance to Parallax:**\n    *   We need to express the number of stars `dN` in terms of parallax (`plx`) instead of distance (`d`).\n    *   We have the relation `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   We also need to relate the thickness of the shell `dd` to the corresponding interval in parallax `d(plx)`. We can do this by taking the derivative of `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d(1/plx) / d(plx) = -1/plx²`\n    *   This gives us `dd = (-1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n    *   The negative sign indicates that as distance (`d`) increases, parallax (`plx`) decreases. Since we are interested in the number of stars in a given range (a magnitude), we can ignore the sign and use the absolute value: `|dd| = (1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n\n4.  **Substituting to Find the Distribution in Parallax:**\n    *   Now we substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` into our equation for `dN`:\n        `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n    *   Simplifying this expression:\n        `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n5.  **Finding the Number of Stars per Unit Range of Parallax:**\n    *   The question asks for \"how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with plx\". This is precisely the term `dN / d(plx)`.\n    *   From our equation in the previous step, we can rearrange to find this:\n        `dN / d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n    *   Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, we can see the proportionality:\n        `dN / d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
