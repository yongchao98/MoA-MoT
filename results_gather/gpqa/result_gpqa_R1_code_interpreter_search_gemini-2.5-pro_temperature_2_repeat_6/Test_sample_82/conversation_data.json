The initial volume is 20.00 cm³ and 20.00 cm³ of water is added, making the total volume 40.00 cm³. I'll use the dilution formula M1V1 = M2V2 to find the new concentration (M2).\n    *   M1 = 0.05 M, V1 = 20.00 cm³\n    *   V2 = 40.00 cm³\n    *   M2 = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M.\n\n2.  **pH at 25% Titration:** This point is in the buffer region of the titration. A buffer solution containing the weak acid (CH3COOH) and its conjugate base (CH3COO-) is formed.\n    *   The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is perfect for this: pH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[acid]).\n    *   First, calculate pKa: pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85x10⁻⁵).\n    *   At 25% titration, 25% of the initial acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH to form acetate (the conjugate base). This means 75% of the acid remains.\n    *   The ratio [conjugate base]/[acid] is therefore 25/75 or 1/3.\n    *   I will plug these values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH.\n\n3.  **pH at the Equivalence Point:** At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been completely reacted with NaOH. The solution now contains only the conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH3COONa).\n    *   The acetate ion (CH3COO-) is a weak base and will hydrolyze in water, producing OH⁻ ions:\n        CH3COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH3COOH + OH⁻\n    *   To solve this, I need to:\n        a.  Calculate the initial moles of acetic acid. (Moles = Molarity * Volume = 0.025 M * 0.040 L)\n        b.  Determine the volume of 0.1 M NaOH required to reach the equivalence point. (V_base = Moles_acid / M_base)\n        c.  Calculate the total volume of the solution at the equivalence point. (V_total = V_acid_solution + V_NaOH_added)\n        d.  Find the concentration of the acetate ion at the equivalence point. ([CH3COO⁻] = Moles_acid / V_total)\n        e.  Calculate Kb for acetate using the relationship Kw = Ka * Kb, where Kw = 1.0x10⁻¹⁴.\n        f.  Use an ICE table (or the simplified formula for a weak base) to find the [OH⁻] from the hydrolysis reaction: [OH⁻] = √(Kb * [CH3COO⁻]).\n        g.  Calculate pOH = -log[OH⁻].\n        h.  Finally, find the pH: pH = 14.00 - pOH.\n\n4.  **Computation:** The calculations involve logarithms and square roots. To ensure accuracy and speed, I will use a Python script to perform all these calculations step-by-step and then print the final results for the pH at both points, rounded to two decimal places as is standard for pH and matches the options. The script will follow the logical steps outlined above.\n\n```output\npH at 25% titration: 4.26\npH at equivalence point: 8.52\n```\n<<<A>>>",
    "This is a step-by-step calculation for a weak acid-strong base titration problem.\n\n### **Part 1: pH at 25% Titration**\n\n1.  **Calculate the concentration of the diluted acetic acid (HA):**\n    The initial solution of 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water.\n    *   Initial moles of acetic acid = Molarity × Volume = 0.05 mol/L × (20.00 cm³ / 1000 cm³/L) = 0.001 mol.\n    *   Total volume after dilution = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³.\n    *   Concentration of diluted acid = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / (40.00 cm³ / 1000 cm³/L) = **0.025 M**.\n\n2.  **Apply the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:**\n    At 25% titration, 25% of the weak acid (HA) has reacted with NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻), and 75% of the acid remains unreacted. This creates a buffer solution. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used to find the pH of a buffer:\n    pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n\n3.  **Calculate the necessary values:**\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n    *   The ratio of [A⁻]/[HA] at 25% titration is 0.25 / 0.75 = 1/3.\n\n4.  **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log(1/3) = 4.73 - log(3)\n    *   pH ≈ 4.73 - 0.477 = **4.253**\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH is **4.26**.\n\n### **Part 2: pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n1.  **Determine the state of the solution:**\n    At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. The solution now contains only water and the salt formed, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The acetate ion (A⁻) is the conjugate base of a weak acid and will hydrolyze in water, making the solution basic.\n    A⁻ + H₂O ⇌ HA + OH⁻\n\n2.  **Calculate the volume and concentration at the equivalence point:**\n    *   Initial moles of acid = 0.001 mol (from Part 1).\n    *   At the equivalence point, moles of NaOH added = moles of acid = 0.001 mol.\n    *   Volume of NaOH needed = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³.\n    *   Total volume of solution = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n    *   Concentration of acetate [A⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = **0.02 M**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the concentration of hydroxide ions [OH⁻]:**\n    We need the base dissociation constant (Kb) for the acetate ion.\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n    *   The hydrolysis reaction gives [OH⁻] = √(Kb × [A⁻]).\n    *   [OH⁻] = √(5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ × 0.02) = √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n\n4.  **Calculate pOH and then pH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = **8.52**\n\nThe calculated values are pH = 4.26 at 25% titration and pH = 8.52 at the equivalence point. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
