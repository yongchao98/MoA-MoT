    "This problem requires calculating the distribution of cobalt(II) species in a solution containing thiocyanate ions. We need to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species.\n\n**1. Define the species and equilibria**\nThe species in solution are free `Co^2+` ions and the complexes formed by the stepwise addition of thiocyanate ligands (`SCN-`):\n*   `Co^2+`\n*   `[Co(SCN)]^+`\n*   `[Co(SCN)2]`\n*   `[Co(SCN)3]^-`\n*   `[Co(SCN)4]^2-`\n\nThe formation of these complexes is described by the overall stability constants (β):\n*   `Co^2+ + SCN^- ⇔ [Co(SCN)]^+` ; `β1 = [[Co(SCN)]^+] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]) = 9`\n*   `Co^2+ + 2SCN^- ⇔ [Co(SCN)2]` ; `β2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^2) = 40`\n*   `Co^2+ + 3SCN^- ⇔ [Co(SCN)3]^-` ; `β3 = [[Co(SCN)3]^-] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^3) = 63`\n*   `Co^2+ + 4SCN^- ⇔ [Co(SCN)4]^2-` ; `β4 = [[Co(SCN)4]^2-] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^4) = 16`\n\n**2. Express total cobalt concentration**\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all cobalt-containing species:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [[Co(SCN)]^+] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]^-] + [[Co(SCN)4]^2-]`\n\nWe can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co^2+]` and the ligand concentration `[SCN^-]`:\n*   `[[Co(SCN)]^+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)2]] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^2`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)3]^-] = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^3`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)4]^2-] = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^4`\n\nSubstituting these into the `c(Co)` equation:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + β1[Co^2+][SCN^-] + β2[Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 + β3[Co^2+][SCN^-]^3 + β4[Co^2+][SCN^-]^4`\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4)`\n\n**3. Calculate the mole fraction (α) of the target complex**\nThe percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, is its mole fraction (α₂) multiplied by 100. The mole fraction is the concentration of the species divided by the total cobalt concentration.\n\n`α₂ = [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)`\n`α₂ = (β₂ * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β₁[SCN^-] + β₂[SCN^-]^2 + β₃[SCN^-]^3 + β₄[SCN^-]^4))`\n\nThe `[Co^2+]` term cancels out:\n`α₂ = (β₂ * [SCN^-]^2) / (1 + β₁[SCN^-] + β₂[SCN^-]^2 + β₃[SCN^-]^3 + β₄[SCN^-]^4)`\n\nNotice that the total cobalt concentration, `c(Co) = 10^-2 M`, is not needed for this calculation as we are interested in the relative distribution of species. We can assume the equilibrium concentration of thiocyanate `[SCN^-]` is approximately its initial concentration of `0.1 M` because it is in excess compared to the total cobalt concentration.\n\n**4. Perform the calculation**\nWe will now use a python script to compute the value precisely.\n```python\nSCN_conc = 0.1  # M\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\n\n# Numerator corresponds to the [Co(SCN)2] species\nnumerator = beta2 * (SCN_conc ** 2)\n\n# Denominator is the sum of terms for all species, from Co^2+ (term = 1) to [Co(SCN)4]^2-\ndenominator = 1 + (beta1 * SCN_conc**1) + (beta2 * SCN_conc**2) + (beta3 * SCN_conc**3) + (beta4 * SCN_conc**4)\n\n# Calculate the fraction (alpha2)\nalpha2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert to percentage\npercentage = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(percentage)\n```\n\n16.916180326482278\n\nThe calculated percentage is approximately 16.92%. Comparing this with the given options:\nA) 42.3%\nB) 16.9%\nC) 38.1%\nD) 25.6%\n\nThe closest option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "**Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the percentage of one specific cobalt complex, `[Co(SCN)2]` (dithiocyanato cobalt(II)), relative to the total concentration of all species containing cobalt.\n\n2.  **Identify Chemical Species:** The problem involves a central metal ion, `Co(II)` or `Co^2+`, and a ligand, `SCN-` (thiocyanate). These react to form a series of complexes:\n    *   `Co^2+` (free ion)\n    *   `[Co(SCN)]^+` (monothiocyanato)\n    *   `[Co(SCN)2]` (dithiocyanato) - This is the target species.\n    *   `[Co(SCN)3]^-` (trithiocyanato)\n    *   `[Co(SCN)4]^2-` (tetrathiocyanato)\n\n3.  **Define Total Cobalt Concentration (`c(Co)`):** The total concentration of cobalt is the sum of the concentrations of all the species listed above.\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [[Co(SCN)]^+] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]^-] + [[Co(SCN)4]^2-]`\n\n4.  **Use Stability Constants (β):** The problem provides the overall stability constants (`β`), which relate the concentration of each complex to the concentration of the free metal ion (`[Co^2+]`) and the free ligand (`[SCN-]`).\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)]^+] = β₁ * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)2]] = β₂ * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)3]^-] = β₃ * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)4]^2-] = β₄ * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4`\n    *   (Note: For the free ion `Co^2+`, we can consider its \"formation\" from itself to have a β₀ of 1)\n\n5.  **Express `c(Co)` in Terms of `[Co^2+]`:** Substitute the expressions from step 4 into the equation from step 3.\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] + β₁[Co^2+][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co^2+][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co^2+][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co^2+][SCN⁻]⁴`\n    Factor out `[Co^2+]`:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n6.  **Formulate the Fraction of the Target Species:** The percentage we want is `([[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)) * 100%`. The fraction `[[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)` is often denoted as the mole fraction, `α₂`.\n    `α₂ = [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)`\n    Substitute the expressions for `[[Co(SCN)2]]` and `c(Co)`:\n    `α₂ = (β₂ * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]²) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β₁[SCN-]¹ + β₂[SCN-]² + β₃[SCN-]³ + β₄[SCN-]⁴))`\n\n7.  **Simplify the Expression:** The `[Co^2+]` term appears in both the numerator and the denominator, so it cancels out. This is a key insight: the *relative distribution* of species depends only on the free ligand concentration, not the total metal concentration.\n    `α₂ = (β₂ * [SCN-]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN-]¹ + β₂[SCN-]² + β₃[SCN-]³ + β₄[SCN-]⁴)`\n\n8.  **Plug in the Given Values:**\n    *   `[SCN-] = 0.1 M` (We can approximate the equilibrium ligand concentration with the initial concentration because the ligand is in large excess: `0.1 M >> 10^-2 M`)\n    *   `β₁ = 9`\n    *   `β₂ = 40`\n    *   `β₃ = 63`\n    *   `β₄ = 16`\n\n9.  **Calculate:**\n    *   Calculate the numerator: `Numerator = β₂ * [SCN-]² = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n    *   Calculate the denominator terms:\n        *   `1` (for `Co^2+`)\n        *   `β₁[SCN-]¹ = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9`\n        *   `β₂[SCN-]² = 40 * (0.01) = 0.4`\n        *   `β₃[SCN-]³ = 63 * (0.001) = 0.063`\n        *   `β₄[SCN-]⁴ = 16 * (0.0001) = 0.0016`\n    *   Sum the denominator: `Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n    *   Calculate the fraction `α₂`: `α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n10. **Convert to Percentage:** `Percentage = α₂ * 100% = 0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.92%`\n\n11. **Compare with Options:** The calculated value `16.92%` matches option B. The code output `16.916180326482287` confirms this calculation precisely.\n\n<<<B>>>"
