    "The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed as an extension of the Standard Model (SM) by adding higher-dimensional operators that are consistent with the underlying symmetries of the SM. Let's analyze each of the proposed symmetries:\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry:** This is a fundamental spacetime symmetry that relates the observations of inertial observers. Any relativistic quantum field theory, including the Standard Model and its effective field theory extensions, is built to be Lorentz-invariant. The operators in SMEFT are constructed as scalars under Lorentz transformations. Thus, Lorentz symmetry must be respected.\n\n2.  **Poincare symmetry:** This group of symmetries includes Lorentz symmetry (rotations and boosts) as well as spacetime translations. It is the full spacetime symmetry group of the Standard Model. Like Lorentz symmetry, it is a foundational principle upon which SMEFT is built. All terms in the SMEFT Lagrangian, including the higher-dimensional operators, must be invariant under Poincare transformations.\n\n3.  **CP symmetry:** This is the symmetry under the combined operation of charge conjugation (C) and parity inversion (P). The Standard Model itself is known to violate CP symmetry, as observed in the weak interactions (the CKM matrix contains a complex phase that leads to CP violation). SMEFT is designed to parameterize potential new physics, which can introduce new sources of CP violation beyond what is in the SM. Therefore, SMEFT operators are *not* required to respect CP symmetry. Many operators in the standard SMEFT basis are explicitly CP-violating.\n\n4.  **CPT symmetry:** This is the symmetry under the combined operation of charge conjugation (C), parity inversion (P), and time reversal (T). The CPT theorem, a cornerstone of quantum field theory, states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be CPT-invariant. Since SMEFT is constructed as a local and Lorentz-invariant theory, all of its operators must respect CPT symmetry.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n*   Lorentz symmetry (1) **must** be respected.\n*   Poincare symmetry (2) **must** be respected.\n*   CP symmetry (3) is **not** required to be respected.\n*   CPT symmetry (4) **must** be respected due to the CPT theorem.\n\nTherefore, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry. This corresponds to the set {1, 2, 4}.\n\n<<<B>>>"
