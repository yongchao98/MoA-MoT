    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Physical System:**\n    The problem describes an \"oscillating charge distribution\" that is \"spheroid in shape\" with the symmetry axis along the z-axis. This is a source of electromagnetic radiation. In the absence of more specific information about the nature of the oscillation (e.g., deformation of the spheroid), the simplest and most common physical model to apply is that of an oscillating electric dipole. This corresponds to charge oscillating back and forth along the axis of symmetry (the z-axis).\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Electric Dipole Radiation:**\n    For an electric dipole `p(t)` oscillating along the z-axis, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle `(dP/dΩ)` in the radiation zone is given by:\n    `dP/dΩ = K * sin²(θ)`\n    where `θ` is the angle measured from the z-axis, and `K` is a term that depends on the frequency of oscillation and the amplitude of the dipole moment, but not on the angle `θ`. The function `f` mentioned in the problem is this `dP/dΩ`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Angular Dependence and Find the Fraction:**\n    *   The radiated power `dP/dΩ` is proportional to `sin²(θ)`.\n    *   The maximum power, `A`, occurs when `sin²(θ)` is at its maximum value. The maximum value of `sin(θ)` is 1, which happens at `θ = 90°`. Thus, the maximum radiated power is `A ∝ sin²(90°) = 1`.\n    *   We need to find the fraction of this maximum power that is radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`. First, we calculate the power at this angle:\n        `Power at 30° ∝ sin²(30°)`\n    *   We know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\n    *   Therefore, `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n    *   The fraction of the maximum power is the ratio of the power at `30°` to the maximum power `A`:\n        `Fraction = (Power at 30°) / (Maximum Power) = (proportionality factor at 30°) / (proportionality factor at 90°) = (1/4) / 1 = 1/4`.\n\n4.  **Determine the Wavelength (λ) Dependence:**\n    *   The total power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency `ω`. This is a standard result from electromagnetic theory.\n    *   `P_total ∝ ω⁴`\n    *   The power per unit solid angle, `f(λ, θ) = dP/dΩ`, must also have the same frequency dependence.\n        `f(λ, θ) ∝ ω⁴`\n    *   The angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` and the speed of light `c` by the formula `ω = 2πc / λ`.\n    *   Substituting this relationship into the proportionality for `f`:\n        `f(λ, θ) ∝ (2πc / λ)⁴ ∝ 1/λ⁴ = λ⁻⁴`\n    *   Therefore, a possible form for the function `f` involves a `λ⁻⁴` term. This inverse fourth-power dependence is also characteristic of Rayleigh scattering, which is fundamentally based on dipole radiation.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The fraction of the maximum power `A` radiated at `θ = 30°` is `1/4`.\n    *   A possible form of the power distribution function `f` is proportional to `λ⁻⁴`.\n\n    Comparing these results with the given options:\n    A) 1/4, λ⁻⁴\n    B) 1/2, λ⁻⁴\n    C) 3/4, λ⁻⁶\n    D) 1/4, λ⁻³\n\n    Our calculated results match option A exactly.\n\n(Note: If one were to consider a more complex oscillation, like an electric quadrupole, the angular dependence would be `sin²(θ)cos²(θ)` and the wavelength dependence `λ⁻⁶`. This would lead to a fraction of 3/4 and match option C. However, without explicit information suggesting that the dipole moment is zero and the quadrupole moment is the dominant radiating term, the standard and simplest physical model to assume is electric dipole radiation.)\n\n<<<A>>>"
