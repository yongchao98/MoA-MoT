    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n### Step 1: Classify the Substituents\n\nFirst, we classify the substituent on each benzene ring (C6H5-) as either an *ortho, para*-director or a *meta*-director. This classification is the primary determinant of the para-isomer yield.\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directors**: These groups direct the incoming electrophile (bromine) primarily to the ortho and para positions. They generally lead to a high yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   -CH3 (in Toluene, **1**): Activating group.\n    *   -C2H5 (in Ethylbenzene, **5**): Activating group.\n    *   -Cl (in Chlorobenzene, **3**): Deactivating, but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Meta-directors**: These groups direct the incoming electrophile primarily to the meta position. They lead to a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   -NO2 (in Nitrobenzene, **4**): Strongly deactivating group.\n    *   -COOH (in Benzoic acid, **6**): Deactivating group.\n    *   -COOC2H5 (in Ethyl benzoate, **2**): Deactivating group.\n\nFrom this initial classification, we know that the substances with meta-directors will have the lowest para yields and will appear at the beginning of the list, while substances with ortho, para-directors will have the highest yields and will appear at the end.\n\n### Step 2: Rank the Meta-Directors (4, 6, 2)\n\nFor meta-directing groups, the yield of the para-isomer is extremely small. The stronger the deactivating (and thus meta-directing) effect of the group, the lower the yield of any non-meta products, including the para-isomer. We need to rank these groups by their deactivating strength.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength for these groups is well-established:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n\n*   **-NO2 (4)** is the strongest deactivator, so it will produce the least amount of para-isomer.\n*   **-COOH (6)** is the next strongest deactivator.\n*   **-COOC2H5 (2)** is the weakest deactivator among these three.\n\nTherefore, the order of *increasing* para-isomer yield for this group is:\nNitrobenzene (**4**) < Benzoic acid (**6**) < Ethyl benzoate (**2**)\nSo the beginning of our sequence is **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n### Step 3: Rank the Ortho, Para-Directors (1, 5, 3)\n\nFor ortho, para-directing groups, the yield of the para-isomer is significant. The exact percentage depends on the ratio of the para product to the ortho product (para/ortho ratio). This ratio is governed by two factors: steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n1.  **Comparing -CH3 (1) and -C2H5 (5)**: Both are alkyl groups that direct o,p. The primary difference is steric bulk. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). Increased steric bulk at the substituent hinders the approach of the electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions, thus favoring substitution at the less hindered para position. This leads to a higher para/ortho ratio for ethylbenzene compared to toluene.\n    *   Therefore, the para yield of Toluene (**1**) is less than that of Ethylbenzene (**5**). The order is **1 < 5**.\n\n2.  **Comparing alkyl groups with -Cl (3)**: The chloro group is an ortho, para-director, but it's a special case. It is deactivating due to its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I). This inductive effect is felt most strongly at the ortho position, making it significantly less reactive than the para position. This electronic factor, combined with steric hindrance from the chlorine atom, leads to a very high para/ortho ratio for chlorobenzene. Experimental data confirms that the bromination of chlorobenzene yields a very high percentage of the para-isomer (around 87%), which is typically higher than that for toluene (~67%) or ethylbenzene.\n    *   Therefore, the para yield of Chlorobenzene (**3**) is the highest among these three. The order is **... < 3**.\n\nCombining the rankings for the ortho, para-directors gives the order of increasing para yield:\nToluene (**1**) < Ethylbenzene (**5**) < Chlorobenzene (**3**)\nThe end of our sequence is **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### Step 4: Combine the Rankings\n\nNow, we combine the ranked lists of the meta-directors and the ortho, para-directors. The para yields for all meta-directors are much lower than for any of the ortho, para-directors.\n\n*   Meta-director order: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Ortho, para-director order: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nCombining them gives the final sequence in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
