    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and analyze its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of Product 1\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating.\n*   **Reaction:** This is an α-bromination of a carboxylic acid. Although the reagents are not the classic Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (PBr3/Br2) conditions, the outcome is the same. Pyridine acts as a base to facilitate the formation of an enolate or enol from acetic acid, which then attacks the bromine. The result is the substitution of one of the α-hydrogens with a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n### Step 2: Formation of Product 2\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid, BrCH2COOH) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a classic Fischer esterification reaction. The carboxylic acid reacts with the alcohol in the presence of a strong acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n### Step 3: Formation of Product 3\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a good nucleophile, and the carbon bonded to bromine in ethyl bromoacetate is a primary alkyl halide, making it an excellent substrate for an SN2 reaction. The cyanide ion displaces the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n### Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH2)5Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a two-step process similar to the malonic ester synthesis for forming cyclic compounds.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that removes one of the acidic α-protons from the carbon atom located between the cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOCH2CH3) groups. These protons are particularly acidic due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the adjacent functional groups.\n        NCCH2COOEt + NaH → Na⁺[NCCH⁻COOEt] + H₂\n    2.  **Alkylation and Cyclization:** The resulting carbanion is a strong nucleophile. It attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction (first alkylation).\n        [NCCH⁻COOEt] + Br(CH2)5Br → NCCH(COOEt)(CH2)5Br + Br⁻\n        Since NaH is in excess, it deprotonates the remaining α-proton, forming another carbanion.\n        NCCH(COOEt)(CH2)5Br + NaH → Na⁺[NCC⁻(COOEt)(CH2)5Br] + H₂\n        This carbanion then undergoes a rapid intramolecular SN2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentyl chain and displacing the second bromide ion to form a stable six-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n### 1H NMR Analysis of Product 4\nNow, we must determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane. The key is to analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\n**Structure of Product 4:**\nA cyclohexane ring with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3) attached to the same carbon atom (C1).\n\n**Analysis of Symmetry:**\n1.  **Ethyl Group:** The ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3) has two sets of chemically distinct protons:\n    *   The methylene protons (-O-CH₂-CH₃): One signal.\n    *   The methyl protons (-O-CH₂-CH₃): A second signal.\n    This contributes **2 signals** to the spectrum.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n    *   The C1 carbon is attached to four different groups: a -CN group, a -COOEt group, the C2 of the ring, and the C6 of the ring. However, since the two paths around the ring from C1 (C1-C2-C3... and C1-C6-C5...) are identical, C1 is not a stereocenter, and the molecule is achiral.\n    *   However, the two substituents on C1 (-CN and -COOEt) are different from each other. This breaks the plane of symmetry that would otherwise pass through C1 and C4 in a symmetrically 1,1-disubstituted cyclohexane.\n    *   Because there is no such plane of symmetry:\n        *   The protons on C2 are not equivalent to the protons on C6.\n        *   The protons on C3 are not equivalent to the protons on C5.\n        *   The protons on C4 are unique.\n    *   This means there are five chemically distinct methylene groups in the ring: C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6.\n    *   Furthermore, within each of these five CH₂ groups, the two geminal protons (the axial and equatorial protons) are diastereotopic. This is because there is no local plane of symmetry or C2 axis that can interchange them. For example, the axial proton on C2 has a different spatial relationship to the -CN and -COOEt groups than the equatorial proton on C2. This holds true even with rapid chair-flipping.\n    *   Therefore, each of the five distinct methylene groups (C2, C3, C4, C5, C6) will show two signals, one for the axial proton and one for the equatorial proton.\n    *   Number of signals from the ring = 5 methylene groups × 2 signals/group = **10 signals**.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\nTotal signals = (Signals from ethyl group) + (Signals from cyclohexane ring)\nTotal signals = 2 + 10 = 12\n\nThere are 12 chemically distinct sets of hydrogen atoms in product 4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
