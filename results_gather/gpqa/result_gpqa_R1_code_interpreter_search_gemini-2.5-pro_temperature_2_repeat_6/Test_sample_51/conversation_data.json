    "Answering this question involves applying the Boltzmann equation, which describes the statistical distribution of atoms in various energy levels in a system in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics:** The question asks for the change in the ratio of the population of two energy levels of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms at two different temperatures. Since the stellar photosphere is assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the population ratio is governed by the Boltzmann equation.\n\n2.  **The Boltzmann Equation:** The ratio of the number of atoms (N) in two energy levels, an upper level 2 and a lower level 1, is given by:\n    $$ \\frac{N_2}{N_1} = \\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k T}} $$\n    where:\n    *   `N₂` and `N₁` are the number of atoms in energy level 2 and 1.\n    *   `g₂` and `g₁` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the levels.\n    *   `E₂ - E₁` is the energy difference between the two levels, which we will call `ΔE`.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `T` is the absolute temperature.\n\n3.  **Define the Ratios for Both Scenarios:**\n    Let's define the population ratio `R` as `N₂ / N₁`. We need to calculate this for the two given scenarios: with and without sunspots.\n\n    *   **Without Spots:** The temperature is `T_no_spots = 6000 K`. The ratio is:\n        $$ R_{no\\_spots} = \\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_{no\\_spots}}} $$\n\n    *   **With Spots:** The overall effective temperature is `T_spots = 5500 K`. The ratio is:\n        $$ R_{spots} = \\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_{spots}}} $$\n\n4.  **Determine the Factor of Change:** The question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star has no spots compared to when it has spots. This is the ratio of the two ratios calculated above:\n    $$ F = \\frac{R_{no\\_spots}}{R_{spots}} $$\n    Substituting the expressions:\n    $$ F = \\frac{\\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_{no\\_spots}}}}{\\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_{spots}}}} $$\n    The statistical weights `g₂/g₁` cancel out:\n    $$ F = \\frac{e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_{no\\_spots}}}}{e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_{spots}}}} $$\n    Using the property of exponents `e^a / e^b = e^(a-b)`:\n    $$ F = e^{\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_{no\\_spots}} - \\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_{spots}}\\right)\\right)} $$\n    $$ F = e^{\\left(\\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_{spots}} - \\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_{no\\_spots}}\\right)} $$\n    $$ F = e^{\\left(\\frac{\\Delta E}{k} \\left( \\frac{1}{T_{spots}} - \\frac{1}{T_{no\\_spots}} \\right)\\right)} $$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Energy Difference (ΔE):** The energy difference `ΔE` corresponds to the energy of a photon with the given transition wavelength `λ = 1448 Å`.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for the solution:\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Question:** The problem asks for the factor by which the ratio of the population of two energy levels of a neutral Titanium (Ti) atom changes. This change is due to a change in the star's photospheric temperature. The ratio is `Ratio(No Spots) / Ratio(With Spots)`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Governing Physical Principle:** The problem states that the stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). In such a system, the relative populations of atomic energy levels are described by the Boltzmann equation.\n\n3.  **State the Boltzmann Equation:** The ratio of the number of atoms `N₂` in an upper energy state `E₂` to the number of atoms `N₁` in a lower energy state `E₁` is given by:\n    $$ \\frac{N_2}{N_1} = \\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\frac{(E_2 - E_1)}{kT}} = \\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT}} $$\n    where:\n    *   `g₂` and `g₁` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the two levels.\n    *   `ΔE = E₂ - E₁` is the energy difference between the levels.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `T` is the absolute temperature.\n\n4.  **Set Up the Ratios for the Two Scenarios:**\n    *   Let `R_no_spots` be the population ratio when the temperature is `T_no_spots = 6000 K`.\n        $$ R_{no\\_spots} = \\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_{no\\_spots}}} $$\n    *   Let `R_spots` be the population ratio when the temperature is `T_spots = 5500 K`.\n        $$ R_{spots} = \\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_{spots}}} $$\n\n5.  **Determine the Required Factor (F):** The question asks for the factor by which the ratio without spots compares to the ratio with spots. This is `F = R_no_spots / R_spots`.\n    $$ F = \\frac{\\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_{no\\_spots}}}}{\\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_{spots}}}} $$\n    The term for statistical weights, `g₂/g₁`, cancels out, as it is a property of the atom and does not change with temperature.\n    $$ F = \\frac{e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_{no\\_spots}}}}{e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_{spots}}}} $$\n    Using the properties of exponents (`e^a / e^b = e^(a-b)`), we can simplify the expression:\n    $$ F = e^{\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_{no\\_spots}} - \\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_{spots}}\\right)\\right)} = e^{\\left(\\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_{spots}} - \\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_{no\\_spots}}\\right)} $$\n    Factoring out the `ΔE/k` term gives the final formula for calculation:\n    $$ F = e^{\\frac{\\Delta E}{k} \\left( \\frac{1}{T_{spots}} - \\frac{1}{T_{no\\_spots}} \\right)} $$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Energy Difference (ΔE):** The energy difference `ΔE` is the energy of a photon associated with the transition wavelength `λ = 1448 Å`. The relationship is `ΔE = hc/λ`.\n    *   Planck's constant, `h = 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s`\n    *   Speed of light, `c = 2.998 x 10⁸ m/s`\n    *   Wavelength, `λ = 1448 Å = 1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m`\n    *   Boltzmann constant, `k = 1.381 x 10⁻²³ J/K`\n\n    It's often easier to work in units of electron-volts (eV).\n    *   `h = 4.136 x 10⁻¹⁵ eV·s`\n    *   `k = 8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K`\n    *   The energy of a photon `ΔE (eV)` can be conveniently calculated as `12400 / λ (Å)`.\n    $$ \\Delta E = \\frac{12400 \\text{ eV·Å}}{1448 \\text{ Å}} \\approx 8.5635 \\text{ eV} $$\n\n7.  **Calculate the Value of the Exponent:**\n    First, find the term `ΔE / k`:\n    $$ \\frac{\\Delta E}{k} = \\frac{8.5635 \\text{ eV}}{8.617 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV/K}} \\approx 99379 \\text{ K} $$\n    Next, find the temperature-dependent term:\n    $$ \\left( \\frac{1}{T_{spots}} - \\frac{1}{T_{no\\_spots}} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{1}{5500} - \\frac{1}{6000} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \\times 6000} \\right) = \\frac{500}{33,000,000} \\approx 1.515 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ K}^{-1} $$\n    Now, calculate the full exponent:\n    $$ \\text{Exponent} = 99379 \\text{ K} \\times 1.515 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ K}^{-1} \\approx 1.5057 $$\n\n8.  **Calculate the Final Factor (F):**\n    $$ F = e^{1.5057} \\approx 4.507 $$\n\n9.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated value `F ≈ 4.507` is very close to the value in option C. The other information given in the problem (stellar radius, mass, spot coverage percentage) is not needed for this specific calculation. The provided code execution result of `4.5064...` further confirms this calculation.\n\nFinal Answer Determination: The result `~4.5` matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
