    "*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    *   First, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU), which indicates the total number of rings and pi bonds in the molecule.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n    *   A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: one ring + three double bonds) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong intensity bands in this region (3300-3500 cm-1) is the classic signature of a primary amine (-NH2) group. The two bands arise from the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The frequency is in the range for an ester (typically 1735-1750 cm-1). Conjugation with the benzene ring (which we suspect from the DoU) would lower this frequency slightly, making 1720 cm-1 a very reasonable value for a conjugated ester.\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal corresponds to 3 protons (a methyl group, -CH3). The multiplicity is a triplet (t), which means it is adjacent to a carbon with 2 protons (a methylene group, -CH2-), according to the n+1 rule. This is characteristic of the methyl part of an ethyl group (-CH2-**CH3**).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal corresponds to 2 protons (a methylene group, -CH2-). Its multiplicity is a quartet (q), meaning it is adjacent to a carbon with 3 protons (a methyl group, -CH3-). The chemical shift is significantly downfield (deshielded), which indicates it's attached to an electronegative atom, most likely an oxygen. This signal is the methylene part of an ethyl group that is attached to an oxygen, as in an ethyl ester (-O-**CH2**-CH3).\n    *   *Combining these two signals*, we can confidently identify an **ethyl group attached to an ester oxygen (-O-CH2-CH3)**.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a broad singlet integrating to 2 protons. The broadness and chemical shift are characteristic of the exchangeable protons of the primary amine (-NH2) group we identified from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is highly characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The two different chemical shifts are due to the electronic effects of the two different substituents. One substituent is electron-donating (the -NH2 group), which shields its ortho protons (shifting them upfield to ~7.0 ppm). The other is electron-withdrawing (the ester group, -COOEt), which deshields its ortho protons (shifting them downfield to ~8.0 ppm).\n\n*   **Putting it all together**\n    1.  We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    2.  The substituents are a primary amine (-NH2) and an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3).\n    3.  This assembly gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n*   **Evaluating the options**\n    *   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This is an isomer but would have a propionyl group (a triplet and quartet in the alkyl region), not an ethyl ester group.\n    *   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is a meta-substituted compound, which would give a more complex aromatic splitting pattern, not two doublets.\n    *   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, which is inconsistent with the IR spectrum (would show one N-H stretch, not two). It would also have a formyl proton signal (-CHO) around 8 ppm, which is not observed.\n    *   D) **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**: This structure perfectly matches all the data: the molecular formula, the DoU, the IR signals for -NH2 and a conjugated ester, and all the 1H NMR signals (para-substituted ring, ethyl ester group, and primary amine protons).\n\n<<<D>>>"
