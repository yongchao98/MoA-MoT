    "My approach to solving this problem involves two main steps. First, I will calculate the amplitude of the photometric variation caused by the rotating, spotted star. Second, I will determine the size of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce an identical signal amplitude during a transit.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the brightness variation due to starspots**\n\nThe problem describes a star with two distinct hemispheres: one pristine and one partially covered by dark spots. The rotational modulation will cause the star's observed brightness to vary. The maximum brightness will occur when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer, and the minimum brightness will occur when the hemisphere with spots faces the observer.\n\nThe flux (F) received from a star is proportional to the sum of the emission from its visible surface, which follows the Stefan-Boltzmann law ($F \\propto A T^4$, where A is the projected area and T is the effective temperature).\n\nLet's define the fluxes:\n*   $F_{max}$: The flux when the unspotted hemisphere faces us. The entire visible disk (with projected area $A_{disk}$) has a temperature $T_{eff}$.\n    $F_{max} \\propto A_{disk} \\cdot T_{eff}^4$\n*   $F_{min}$: The flux when the spotted hemisphere faces us. The filling factor of spots is $f = 0.20$. This means 20% of the visible disk is at the spot temperature ($T_{spot}$), and the remaining 80% is at the stellar effective temperature ($T_{eff}$).\n    $T_{spot} = T_{eff} - 1000K = 6000K - 1000K = 5000K$\n    The flux is a sum of contributions from the spotted and unspotted parts of the disk:\n    $F_{min} \\propto [(1-f) \\cdot A_{disk} \\cdot T_{eff}^4] + [f \\cdot A_{disk} \\cdot T_{spot}^4]$\n\nThe amplitude of the variation is the relative drop in flux from maximum to minimum:\nAmplitude (Spots) = $(F_{max} - F_{min}) / F_{max} = 1 - (F_{min} / F_{max})$\n\nLet's calculate the ratio $F_{min} / F_{max}$:\n$F_{min} / F_{max} = \\frac{(1-f) \\cdot A_{disk} \\cdot T_{eff}^4 + f \\cdot A_{disk} \\cdot T_{spot}^4}{A_{disk} \\cdot T_{eff}^4} = (1-f) + f \\cdot \\left(\\frac{T_{spot}}{T_{eff}}\\right)^4$\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n*   $f = 0.20$\n*   $T_{eff} = 6000 K$\n*   $T_{spot} = 5000 K$\n\nAmplitude (Spots) = $1 - \\left[ (1-0.20) + 0.20 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{5000}{6000}\\right)^4 \\right]$\n\n**Step 2: Relate the spot signal to an exoplanet transit signal**\n\nThe drop in brightness caused by a transiting exoplanet is, to a first approximation, the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.\nAmplitude (Planet) = $(R_{planet} / R_{star})^2 = (R_{pl}/R_{star})^2$\n\nThe problem asks for the planet radius ($R_{pl}/R_{star}$) that would produce the same amplitude signal. Therefore, we can set the two amplitudes equal:\n$(R_{pl}/R_{star})^2 = \\text{Amplitude (Spots)}$\n$R_{pl}/R_{star} = \\sqrt{\\text{Amplitude (Spots)}}$\n\nI will now use a Python script to perform the calculation precisely.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given parameters\nT_eff = 6000.0  # Effective temperature of the star in Kelvin\ndelta_T = 1000.0 # Temperature difference of the spots in Kelvin\nf = 0.20        # Filling factor of spots on one hemisphere\n\n# Calculate the temperature of the spots\nT_spot = T_eff - delta_T\n\n# Calculate the ratio of minimum to maximum flux\n# F_min / F_max = (1-f) + f * (T_spot / T_eff)^4\nflux_ratio = (1 - f) + f * (T_spot / T_eff)**4\n\n# Calculate the amplitude of the signal due to the spots\n# Amplitude = 1 - (F_min / F_max)\namplitude_spots = 1 - flux_ratio\n\n# The amplitude of a transiting exoplanet signal is (R_pl / R_star)^2\n# We set the amplitudes equal to find the required planet size.\n# (R_pl / R_star)^2 = amplitude_spots\n# R_pl / R_star = sqrt(amplitude_spots)\nr_pl_r_star_ratio = math.sqrt(amplitude_spots)\n\nprint(r_pl_r_star_ratio)\n```\n\n<execute_output>\n0.3217904000329976\n</execute_output>\n\nThe calculation shows that the required ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius ($R_{pl}/R_{star}$) is approximately 0.3218. This value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem requires us to find the size of a hypothetical exoplanet that would cause a dip in a star's light curve equal in amplitude to the dimming caused by starspots on a rotating star.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the flux variation due to starspots.**\n\nThe brightness (or flux, F) of a star is proportional to its effective temperature to the fourth power, as described by the Stefan-Boltzmann law ($F \\propto A \\cdot T^4$). We need to compare the flux when the unspotted hemisphere is visible ($F_{max}$) with the flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible ($F_{min}$).\n\n*   **Maximum Flux ($F_{max}$):** This occurs when the observer sees the pristine hemisphere. The entire visible disk has a temperature $T_{eff}$.\n    $F_{max} \\propto A_{disk} \\cdot T_{eff}^4$\n    where $A_{disk}$ is the projected area of the stellar disk.\n\n*   **Minimum Flux ($F_{min}$):** This occurs when the observer sees the hemisphere that is partially covered by spots. The problem states the filling factor of spots is $f = 0.20$ (or 20%). This means 20% of the visible hemisphere's area is at the spot temperature ($T_{spot}$), and the remaining 80% is at the stellar effective temperature ($T_{eff}$).\n    *   $T_{eff} = 6000 \\, K$\n    *   $T_{spot} = T_{eff} - 1000 \\, K = 5000 \\, K$\n    The total flux is the sum of the flux from the hot parts and the cool spotty parts:\n    $F_{min} \\propto [(1-f) \\cdot A_{disk} \\cdot T_{eff}^4] + [f \\cdot A_{disk} \\cdot T_{spot}^4]$\n\n*   **Amplitude of the Signal:** The amplitude of the variation is the relative drop in flux.\n    Amplitude (spots) = $\\frac{F_{max} - F_{min}}{F_{max}} = 1 - \\frac{F_{min}}{F_{max}}$\n\n    Let's compute the ratio $\\frac{F_{min}}{F_{max}}$:\n    $\\frac{F_{min}}{F_{max}} = \\frac{(1-f) \\cdot A_{disk} \\cdot T_{eff}^4 + f \\cdot A_{disk} \\cdot T_{spot}^4}{A_{disk} \\cdot T_{eff}^4}$\n\n    The $A_{disk}$ and $T_{eff}^4$ terms can be factored out, simplifying the expression to:\n    $\\frac{F_{min}}{F_{max}} = (1-f) + f \\left(\\frac{T_{spot}}{T_{eff}}\\right)^4$\n\n    Now, we can calculate the amplitude:\n    Amplitude (spots) = $1 - \\left[ (1-f) + f \\left(\\frac{T_{spot}}{T_{eff}}\\right)^4 \\right]$\n\n    Plugging in the numbers:\n    Amplitude (spots) = $1 - \\left[ (1 - 0.20) + 0.20 \\left(\\frac{5000}{6000}\\right)^4 \\right]$\n    Amplitude (spots) = $1 - \\left[ 0.8 + 0.2 \\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^4 \\right]$\n    Amplitude (spots) â‰ˆ $1 - [0.8 + 0.2 \\cdot (0.48225)] = 1 - [0.8 + 0.09645] = 1 - 0.89645 = 0.10355$\n\n**Step 2: Relate the spot signal to an exoplanet transit.**\n\nThe dip in brightness caused by a transiting exoplanet is, to a first approximation, equal to the ratio of the planet's projected area to the star's projected area.\n\n*   Amplitude (planet) = $\\frac{\\text{Area of planet}}{\\text{Area of star}} = \\frac{\\pi R_{pl}^2}{\\pi R_{star}^2} = \\left(\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}}\\right)^2$\n\n**Step 3: Equate the amplitudes and solve for the planet's relative radius.**\n\nWe need the planet's signal amplitude to be the same as the spot's signal amplitude.\n\nAmplitude (planet) = Amplitude (spots)\n$\\left(\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}}\\right)^2 = 0.10355$\n\nNow, we solve for the ratio $\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}}$ by taking the square root:\n$\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}} = \\sqrt{0.10355} \\approx 0.3218$\n\nThis value is very close to 0.32.\n\nBased on the calculation, the correct option is D. The Python code execution confirms this result.\n\n<<<D>>>"
