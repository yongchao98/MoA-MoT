    "This problem requires identifying the major products of two separate Michael addition reactions. Let's analyze each reaction step-by-step.\n\n### Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition. A strong, sterically hindered base (potassium tert-butoxide, t-BuOK) is used to generate a nucleophile (an enolate) from the ketone, which then attacks an α,β-unsaturated compound (ethyl acrylate).\n\n2.  **Identifying the Nucleophile:**\n    *   The ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   To form an enolate, an α-proton (a proton on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) is required.\n    *   The α-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group, so it has no α-protons.\n    *   C6 has a methyl group and one α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, the only possible enolate that can be formed by deprotonating the ring is by abstracting the proton from C6. The base t-BuOK removes the proton from C6 to form the enolate, which acts as the nucleophile.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Attack:**\n    *   The nucleophilic enolate (with the negative charge effectively on C6) attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon (the CH₂) of the ethyl acrylate moiety.\n\n4.  **Structure of Product A:**\n    *   The original ketone structure remains, but now C6 is bonded to a `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group.\n    *   The product has the following structure: a cyclohexanone ring with the carbonyl at C1. C2 has an ethyl and a methyl group. C6 has a methyl group and a `-(CH₂)₂COOEt` group.\n\n5.  **Naming Product A:** The options name the product as a derivative of ethyl propanoate.\n    *   **Main Chain:** The added fragment comes from ethyl acrylate, and after protonation becomes an ethyl propanoate chain (`-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt`).\n    *   **Numbering the Chain:** The chain is numbered starting from the ester group: `cyclohexyl-C3H₂-C2H₂-C1(=O)OEt`. The cyclohexyl group is attached to C3. So the name is `ethyl 3-(...)propanoate`.\n    *   **Naming the Cyclohexyl Substituent:** We name the cyclohexyl ring as a substituent, where the point of attachment is designated as C1'.\n        *   The attachment point is the original C6 of the ketone. This becomes C1' of the substituent name. The methyl group originally on C6 is now on C1'. So, we have a `1'-methyl` group.\n        *   The carbonyl group (originally C1) is adjacent to the attachment point (C6), so it's at position C2' of the substituent. This gives the `2'-oxo` part of the name.\n        *   The carbon with the geminal ethyl and methyl groups (originally C2) is adjacent to the carbonyl C1, so it is at position C3' of the substituent. This gives `3'-ethyl` and `3'-methyl` groups.\n        *   Combining the substituent names: `(3'-ethyl-1',3'-dimethyl-2'-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n        *   The full name for product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\nThis matches the name for A given in options A and D.\n\n### Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile with KOH and H₂O\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael addition. KOH is the base.\n\n2.  **Identifying the Nucleophile:**\n    *   The α-protons of nitroalkanes are acidic due to the electron-withdrawing nitro group.\n    *   KOH deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (`CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂`) to form a nitronate anion (`CH₃CH₂CH⁻-NO₂`). This is the nucleophile.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Attack:**\n    *   The nucleophilic nitronate attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH₃-CH=CH-CN`).\n    *   The formula for but-2-enenitrile is `C⁴H₃-C³H=C²H-C¹N`. The β-carbon is C3.\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n\n4.  **Structure of Product B:**\n    *   The resulting molecule after protonation (by H₂O) is `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂CN`.\n\n5.  **Naming Product B:**\n    *   **Principal Functional Group:** The nitrile group (-CN) has priority, so the compound is named as a nitrile.\n    *   **Longest Carbon Chain:** We need to find the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon.\n        `C⁶H₃-C⁵H₂-C⁴H(NO₂)-C³H(CH₃)-C²H₂-C¹N`\n        The longest chain has 6 carbons. So, the parent alkane is hexane, and the compound is a `hexanenitrile`.\n    *   **Numbering and Substituents:** The chain is numbered starting from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n        *   There is a methyl group on C3.\n        *   There is a nitro group on C4.\n    *   The full name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nThis matches the name for B given in options C and D.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   The correct name for product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   The correct name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these findings with the given options:\n*   A) A is correct, B is incorrect.\n*   B) A is incorrect, B is incorrect.\n*   C) A is incorrect, B is correct.\n*   D) A is correct, B is correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
