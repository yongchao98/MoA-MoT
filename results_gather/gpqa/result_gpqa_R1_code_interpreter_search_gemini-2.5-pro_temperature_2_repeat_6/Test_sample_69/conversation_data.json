    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the chemical riddle:\n\n**1. Analyze the Clues and Reactions**\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** Solid A + 8 equivalents of gas B -> bright red product C\n*   **Reaction 2:** C + 2 equivalents of gas D -> extremely hazardous product E\n*   **Reaction 3:** C + H₂O -> reforms A (solid) + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)\n*   **Reaction 4:** D (gas) + B (gas) -> H (solvent) (1:1 ratio)\n*   **Goal:** Find the molecular symmetry group of E from the options: A) D∞h, B) C2, C) C2v, D) D4h.\n\n**2. Identify the Components (Working Backwards and Forwards)**\n\n*   **Identify E:** The clue \"extremely hazardous product E\" points to well-known toxic substances. The options for the point group of E are D∞h, C2, C2v, D4h. Let's consider plausible candidates for E with these symmetries:\n    *   **D4h:** XeF₄ (xenon tetrafluoride) is a possibility.\n    *   **C2v:** COCl₂ (phosgene), SO₂Cl₂ (sulfuryl chloride), NO₂, and SO₂ are possibilities. Phosgene (COCl₂) is famously hazardous.\n    *   **D∞h:** CO₂, HCN (C∞v, not D∞h), CS₂.\n    *   **C2:** H₂O₂ (hydrogen peroxide).\n\n    Phosgene (**E = COCl₂**) seems like a very strong candidate for a simple, extremely hazardous molecule. Its molecular structure is planar, with a C=O double bond and two C-Cl single bonds. This structure has a C₂ axis and two vertical mirror planes, which corresponds to the **C2v** point group. This matches option C. Let's assume E = COCl₂ and see if we can make the rest of the puzzle consistent with this conclusion.\n\n*   **Identify B, D, and H (Based on E = COCl₂):**\n    *   E (COCl₂) is formed from C and D. It contains Carbon, Oxygen, and Chlorine.\n    *   Let's analyze Reaction 4: D(g) + B(g) -> H(solvent). The simplest gases that can form COCl₂ are carbon monoxide (CO) and chlorine (Cl₂).\n    *   Let's test the hypothesis: **B = CO** (gas) and **D = Cl₂** (gas).\n    *   The reaction is `CO(g) + Cl₂(g) -> COCl₂(g/l)`. This is a 1:1 reaction, as specified.\n    *   This makes **H = COCl₂** (phosgene). Phosgene is a liquid below 8 °C and can be used as a non-aqueous solvent. This is a consistent fit.\n\n*   **Identify C (Based on B=CO and D=Cl₂):**\n    *   Now we have: B=CO and D=Cl₂. Let's revisit Reaction 1 and 2.\n    *   Reaction 1: A(solid) + 8 B(gas) -> C(bright red).\n    *   Substituting B=CO: A(s) + 8CO(g) -> C(bright red). This suggests C is a metal carbonyl, formed from a metal A. The \"8 equivalents\" is a powerful clue. The synthesis of dicobalt octacarbonyl from cobalt metal is: `2Co(s) + 8CO(g) -> Co₂(CO)₈(s)`. This reaction uses 8 equivalents of CO per 2 atoms of Co. This perfectly matches the stoichiometry if A is cobalt.\n    *   So, let's propose:\n        *   **A = Co** (Cobalt metal, a solid).\n        *   **C = Co₂(CO)₈** (dicobalt octacarbonyl). This compound is an orange-red solid, fitting the \"bright red product\" description.\n\n*   **Verify the remaining reactions:**\n\n    *   **Reaction 2:** C + 2 D -> E\n        *   We have C = Co₂(CO)₈, D = Cl₂, and E = COCl₂.\n        *   The reaction is `Co₂(CO)₈ + 2Cl₂ -> COCl₂ + ...`. While the full balanced equation to produce only phosgene is complex, the reaction of metal carbonyls with chlorine to produce phosgene is a known transformation. For example: `Fe(CO)₅ + 3 Cl₂ → FeCl₃ + 5 CO`. With carefully controlled conditions, the desired `COCl₂` can be a product. So, this reaction is plausible in the context of a chemical puzzle.\n\n    *   **Reaction 3:** C + H₂O -> A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)\n        *   We have C = Co₂(CO)₈.\n        *   The hydrolysis of cobalt carbonyl is complex. In the presence of water, it can lead to the formation of `HCo(CO)₄` (tetracarbonylhydridocobalt(I)). This is a known **strong acid (F)**.\n        *   The CO released during decomposition can react with water to form carbonic acid, `H₂CO₃` (`CO + H₂O ⇌ H₂CO₃`). Carbonic acid is a classic **weak acid (G)**.\n        *   The reaction also produces cobalt salts or hydroxides, e.g., `Co(OH)₂`. The puzzle states that A is reformed. This is the only weak point, as Co metal isn't directly reformed. However, a simple cobalt solid (`Co(OH)₂`) is formed, so the puzzle may use \"reforms A\" loosely to mean a solid of the initial element is formed.\n\n**3. Conclusion on Identities**\nThe most consistent set of compounds that fits the described reactions is:\n*   **A**: Co (Cobalt metal)\n*   **B**: CO (Carbon monoxide)\n*   **C**: Co₂(CO)₈ (Dicobalt octacarbonyl)\n*   **D**: Cl₂ (Chlorine gas)\n*   **E**: COCl₂ (Phosgene)\n*   **F**: HCo(CO)₄ (Tetracarbonylhydridocobalt(I))\n*   **G**: H₂CO₃ (Carbonic acid)\n*   **H**: COCl₂ (Phosgene)\n\n**4. Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E**\n*   The extremely hazardous product E is identified as **phosgene (COCl₂) **.\n*   The structure of phosgene is:\n        O\n       //\n      C\n     / \\\n    Cl Cl\n*   It has a principal C₂ rotation axis that passes through the C=O bond.\n*   It has two vertical mirror planes (σᵥ) that contain the C₂ axis. One is the plane of the molecule itself, and the other is perpendicular to the molecular plane, bisecting the Cl-C-Cl angle.\n*   The presence of a C₂ axis and two vertical mirror planes defines the **C2v** point group.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
