    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) of the given compound, (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. The enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the following formula, which is derived from Hess's law:\n\nΔH_f = (Σ Enthalpies of atomization of elements in their standard state) - (Σ Bond energies of the compound)\n\nLet's break down the calculation into several steps:\n\n**1. Determine the molecular formula and structure of the compound.**\n\nThe compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\nFirst, we count the number of carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) atoms to determine the molecular formula.\n*   `(CH3)2C=`: This part has 1 central carbon atom and 2 methyl (CH3) groups. Total C = 1 + 2 = 3; Total H = 2 * 3 = 6.\n*   `=CH-`: This part has 1 carbon and 1 hydrogen.\n*   `-CH2-`: This part has 1 carbon and 2 hydrogens.\n*   `-CH(CH3)-`: This part has 1 carbon in the main chain, 1 carbon in the methyl group, 1 hydrogen on the chain, and 3 hydrogens in the methyl group. Total C = 1 + 1 = 2; Total H = 1 + 3 = 4.\n*   `-CH2-`: This part has 1 carbon and 2 hydrogens.\n*   `-CH=`: This part has 1 carbon and 1 hydrogen.\n*   `=C(CH3)2`: This part has 1 central carbon and 2 methyl groups. Total C = 1 + 2 = 3; Total H = 2 * 3 = 6.\n\nSumming these up:\n*   Total Carbons (C) = 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12\n*   Total Hydrogens (H) = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n**2. Count the number of each type of bond in the molecule.**\n\nFrom the structure `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`, we can count the bonds:\n*   **C-H bonds:** The number of C-H bonds is simply the total number of hydrogen atoms, which is 22.\n*   **C=C double bonds:** There are two double bonds indicated by `=`. So, there are 2 C=C bonds.\n*   **C-C single bonds:** We can count them from the structure:\n    *   2 bonds in `(CH3)2C=` (from the central C to the two CH3 groups)\n    *   1 bond between `CH` and `CH2`\n    *   1 bond between `CH2` and `CH(CH3)`\n    *   1 bond within `CH(CH3)` (from the chain C to the CH3 group)\n    *   1 bond between `CH(CH3)` and the next `CH2`\n    *   1 bond between `CH2` and `CH`\n    *   2 bonds in `=C(CH3)2` (from the central C to the two CH3 groups)\n    Total C-C single bonds = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 9.\n\nSummary of bonds:\n*   Number of C-C bonds = 9\n*   Number of C=C bonds = 2\n*   Number of C-H bonds = 22\n\n**3. Calculate the enthalpy of atomization of the compound (ΔH_atomization_compound).**\n\nThis is the total energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the compound. It is the sum of the bond energies of all bonds in the molecule.\nGiven bond energies:\n*   Bond energy of C-C = 200 kJ/mol\n*   Bond energy of C=C = 300 kJ/mol\n*   Bond energy of C-H = 400 kJ/mol\n\nΔH_atomization_compound = (9 × BE(C-C)) + (2 × BE(C=C)) + (22 × BE(C-H))\nΔH_atomization_compound = (9 × 200 kJ/mol) + (2 × 300 kJ/mol) + (22 × 400 kJ/mol)\nΔH_atomization_compound = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = 11200 kJ/mol.\n\n**4. Calculate the enthalpy of atomization of the elements (ΔH_atomization_reactants).**\n\nThe formation reaction for C12H22 is:\n12 C(s, graphite) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22\nThe enthalpy of atomization of the reactants is the energy required to form gaseous atoms from the elements in their standard states:\n12 C(s) → 12 C(g)\n11 H2(g) → 22 H(g)\n\nGiven data:\n*   Enthalpy of atomization of carbon = 1000 kJ/mol\n*   Bond energy of H-H = 100 kJ/mol\n\nΔH_atomization_reactants = (12 × ΔH_atom(C)) + (11 × BE(H-H))\nΔH_atomization_reactants = (12 × 1000 kJ/mol) + (11 × 100 kJ/mol)\nΔH_atomization_reactants = 12000 + 1100 = 13100 kJ/mol.\n\n**5. Calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) of the compound.**\n\nΔH_f = ΔH_atomization_reactants - ΔH_atomization_compound\nΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol\nΔH_f = 1900 kJ/mol.\n\n**6. Compare the result with the given options.**\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol.\nThe options are:\nA) 67.4 kJ/mol\nB) 11.44 kJ/g\nC) 11200 kJ/mol (This is the enthalpy of atomization of the compound, not its formation)\nD) 1900 kJ/g\n\nOur result is 1900 kJ/mol, while option D is 1900 kJ/g. Let's convert our result to kJ/g to check option B.\nWe need the molar mass of C12H22.\nMolar Mass (M) = 12 × (molar mass of C) + 22 × (molar mass of H)\nM ≈ 12 × 12.0 g/mol + 22 × 1.0 g/mol = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n\nNow, convert ΔH_f from kJ/mol to kJ/g:\nΔH_f (kJ/g) = ΔH_f (kJ/mol) / M (g/mol)\nΔH_f (kJ/g) = 1900 / 166 ≈ 11.4457... kJ/g.\n\nThis value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
