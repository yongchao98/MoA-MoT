    "**1. Deconstruct the Provided Information**\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature for the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid dimer, broadened by extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so this confirms the functional group is correct for all candidates.\n\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds. All four structures are saturated alkanoic acids (except for the C=O), so this is consistent with all options.\n    *   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This means a proton (let's call it H_A) is coupled to three distinct sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   One neighboring proton (n=1, gives a doublet).\n        *   A group of two neighboring protons (n=2, gives a triplet).\n        *   A group of three neighboring protons (n=3, gives a quartet).\n    *   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This means a different proton (let's call it H_B) is coupled to three other distinct sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   One neighboring proton (n=1, gives a doublet).\n        *   A group of two neighboring protons (n=2, gives a triplet).\n        *   Another group of two neighboring protons (n=2, gives another triplet).\n\n**2. Analyze the Candidate Structures**\n\nWe need to find the structure that has both a proton environment that would produce a `dtq` and another that would produce a `dtt`. Let's parse the formulas and draw the structures. The formulas are written in a way that implies a linear chain of the bracketed groups.\n\n*   **A) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    ```\n              CH3(e) CH3(f)\n              |      |\n    CH3(a)-CH2(b)-CH(c)--CH(d)-COOH\n    ```\n    *   `H(c)` neighbors: `CH2(b)` (2H, triplet), `H(d)` (1H, doublet), `CH3(e)` (3H, quartet). → This gives a **dtq**.\n    *   We need to find a `dtt`. No other proton in this molecule is coupled to one H, two Hs, and another two Hs. For example, `H(d)` is coupled to `H(c)` (1H) and `CH3(f)` (3H), giving a `dq`.\n    *   *Result: Has a `dtq` but not a `dtt`.*\n\n*   **B) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH → 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**\n    ```\n               H(g)     H(d)\n               |        |\n        CH3(h)-C -- C -- CH2(a)-COOH\n               |        |\n             CH2(e)   CH2(b)\n               |        |\n             CH3(f)   CH3(c)\n    ```\n    *   Let's look at the protons on the main chain backbone, `H(g)` and `H(d)`.\n    *   **`H(g)`** neighbors: `CH3(h)` (3H, quartet), `H(d)` (1H, doublet), `CH2(e)` (2H, triplet). → This gives a **dtq**.\n    *   **`H(d)`** neighbors: `H(g)` (1H, doublet), `CH2(b)` (2H, triplet), `CH2(a)` (2H, triplet). → This gives a **dtt**.\n    *   *Result: This structure has a proton that gives a `dtq` signal AND a different proton that gives a `dtt` signal. This is a perfect match.*\n\n*   **C) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n    ```\n                     H(e)     H(f)\n                     |        |\n     CH3(c)-CH2(d)--C -- C -- COOH\n                    |    |\n                  CH2(a) CH2(g)\n                    |    |\n                  CH3(b) CH3(h)\n    ```\n    *   `H(e)` neighbors: `CH2(d)` (2H, triplet), `H(f)` (1H, doublet), `CH2(a)` (2H, triplet). → This gives a **dtt**.\n    *   We need to find a `dtq`. `H(f)` is coupled to `H(e)` (1H) and `CH2(g)` (2H), giving a `dt`. No proton fits the `dtq` pattern.\n    *   *Result: Has a `dtt` but not a `dtq`.*\n\n*   **D) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    ```\n            CH3(a) H(c) H(d)\n            |      |    |\n          CH-----CH----C----CH2(e)-COOH\n            |          |\n          CH3(b)      CH3(f)\n    ```\n    (Note: `CH(CH3)CH3` is an isopropyl group, `(CH3)2CH`)\n    *   `H(d)` neighbors: `H(c)` (1H, doublet), `CH2(e)` (2H, triplet), `CH3(f)` (3H, quartet). → This gives a **dtq**.\n    *   We need to find a `dtt`. `H(c)` is coupled to `H(d)` (1H) and the 6 protons of the isopropyl group (`CH3(a)` + `CH3(b)`), which gives a `doublet of septets`. No proton fits the `dtt` pattern.\n    *   *Result: Has a `dtq` but not a `dtt`.*\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly structure **B** has both a proton environment that produces a doublet of triplets of quartets (`dtq`) and another proton environment that produces a doublet of triplets of triplets (`dtt`). Therefore, it is the only structure that matches all the provided spectral data.\n\n<<<B>>>"
