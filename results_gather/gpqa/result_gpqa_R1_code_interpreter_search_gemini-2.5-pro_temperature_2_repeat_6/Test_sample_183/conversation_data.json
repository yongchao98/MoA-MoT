    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down its structure based on the IUPAC name:\n- The parent structure is ethoxybenzene.\n- The ethoxy group (-OEt) is at position 1.\n- A tert-butyl group (-tBu) is at position 2.\n- A nitro group (-NO2) is at position 3.\n\nThe substituents are arranged in a **1,2,3-pattern**:\n- OEt (at C1) and tBu (at C2) are *ortho* to each other.\n- tBu (at C2) and NO2 (at C3) are *ortho* to each other.\n- OEt (at C1) and NO2 (at C3) are *meta* to each other.\n\n**Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n- **-OEt (ethoxy):** Strong activating group, *ortho, para* director.\n- **-tBu (tert-butyl):** Weak activating group, *ortho, para* director.\n- **-NO2 (nitro):** Strong deactivating group, *meta* director.\n\nThe synthesis of a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene, especially with bulky groups, is notoriously difficult using standard electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) because the directing effects of the substituents often lead to 1,2,4 or 1,3,5 patterns. This suggests that a multi-step synthesis involving functional group manipulation and/or blocking groups is necessary.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Plausibility of the Final Steps**\n\nThe target molecule contains an ethoxy group (-OEt). This is typically formed from a hydroxyl group (-OH) via Williamson ether synthesis (`NaOH/EtBr` or `NaOEt`). A hydroxyl group on a benzene ring (a phenol) is often created from an amino group (-NH2) via diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`) followed by hydrolysis (`H3O+, heat`).\n\nTherefore, a plausible end to the synthesis would be:\n`...-NH2  --[NaNO2/HCl]-->  ...-N2+  --[H3O+, heat]-->  ...-OH  --[NaOH/EtBr]-->  ...-OEt`\n\nLet's look for this pattern in the options.\n\n**3. Analyze Each Option**\n\nAll options start with Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene to form tert-butylbenzene. This is a reasonable first step.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    This sequence proposes nitrating benzene, reducing it to aniline, and then performing a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Friedel-Crafts reactions fail on anilines because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) coordinates with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring. Therefore, Option B is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    Step (iv) is diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`). This reaction requires an amino group (-NH2). The product from step (iii) is a sulfonated nitrotoluene derivative, which has no amino group. Therefore, this sequence is chemically impossible. Option C is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** `... iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    This sequence correctly forms an amine (iv) and diazotizes it (v). However, step (vi) attempts to nitrate the resulting diazonium salt. Diazonium salts are highly unstable and are used immediately in the next step. Nitrating a diazonium salt is not a standard or viable reaction under these conditions. Therefore, Option D is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4`\n    This is the only remaining option. Let's analyze its chemical logic, despite the regiochemical challenges pointed out earlier.\n    - **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Forms `tert-butylbenzene`.\n    - **ii) HNO3/H2SO4 (Nitration):** The bulky tert-butyl group is an *o,p*-director, but it strongly favors *para* substitution due to sterics. The major product is `p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene`. A \"high-yield\" synthesis would proceed through this major isomer.\n    - **iii) Fe/HCl (Reduction):** Reduces the nitro group to an amino group, forming `p-tert-butylaniline`.\n    - **iv) HNO3/H2SO4 (Nitration):** We are nitrating `p-tert-butylaniline`. The powerful activating -NH2 group directs *ortho*. So, the nitro group adds at the position ortho to the amine and meta to the tert-butyl group. Product: `4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline`.\n    - **v) NaNO2/HCl (Diazotization):** Converts the -NH2 group into a diazonium salt (-N2+).\n    - **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat (Hydrolysis):** Replaces the diazonium salt with a hydroxyl group (-OH), forming `4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol`.\n    - **vii) NaOH/EtBr (Williamson Ether Synthesis):** Converts the phenol to an ether, forming `1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene`.\n\n    **Conclusion of steps i-vii:** This sequence is a chemically logical and high-yield synthesis for **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**, which is a **1,2,4-isomer**. This does not match the **1,2,3-isomer** in the question's title.\n\n    - **viii) SO3/H2SO4 (Sulfonation) and ix) dilute H2SO4 (Desulfonation):** These last two steps involve adding a sulfonic acid group and then immediately removing it. This has no net effect on the molecule and seems nonsensical in this context.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nThere appears to be a significant error in the question. None of the proposed pathways lead to the named product (a 1,2,3-isomer) in high yield. Options B, C, and D contain chemically impossible steps. Option A describes a logical synthesis for a related compound (a 1,2,4-isomer), albeit with two superfluous steps at the end. Given that a choice must be made from the given options, Option A is the \"least incorrect\" as it represents the only plausible sequence of reaction *types*, despite leading to the wrong regioisomer and having redundant final steps. It is the only option that is not fundamentally impossible from a reaction-order perspective.\n\n<<<A>>>"
