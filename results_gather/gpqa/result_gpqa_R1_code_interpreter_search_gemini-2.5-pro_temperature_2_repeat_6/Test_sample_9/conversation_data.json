    "*   **Analysis of the Options:**\n\n    *   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This serves as our reference point. The density of Earth is approximately 5.51 g/cm³. Let's call this density ρ_E.\n\n    *   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density of this planet is explicitly given as ~5.5 g/cm³, which is approximately the same as Earth's density (ρ_E).\n\n    *   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** Planets are not perfectly rigid. The immense gravitational pull of a massive planet compresses its constituent materials. This phenomenon is known as gravitational compression. If a planet has the same composition as Earth (e.g., the same ratio of iron, silicate rock, etc.) but is significantly more massive, its own gravity will squeeze it more tightly. This compression forces the atoms closer together, resulting in a higher overall density. Therefore, this planet will be denser than Earth.\n\n    *   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** Following the same logic as in option (c), a planet with less mass will experience weaker self-gravity. This leads to less gravitational compression. Consequently, a planet with the same composition as Earth but only half the mass will be less dense than Earth.\n\n*   **Comparison:**\n\n    *   Planet (a): Density = ρ_E ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n    *   Planet (b): Density ≈ ρ_E ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n    *   Planet (c): Density > ρ_E (due to higher mass and gravitational compression)\n    *   Planet (d): Density < ρ_E (due to lower mass and less gravitational compression)\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n\n    The planet described in option (c) is the most massive among those with Earth-like composition. The increased mass leads to stronger gravitational compression, making it the densest of all the options.\n\n<<<C>>>"
