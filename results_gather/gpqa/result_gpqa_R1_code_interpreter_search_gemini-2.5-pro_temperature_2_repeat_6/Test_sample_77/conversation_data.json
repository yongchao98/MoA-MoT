    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Concept:** The question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) produced by a moving point charge. This is a standard problem in classical electrodynamics, and the solutions are known as the **Liénard-Wiechert potentials**. These potentials account for the fact that electromagnetic signals propagate at a finite speed, `c`.\n\n2.  **Understand Retardation:** The field at a specific point in space `r` and at a specific time `t` is not determined by the charge's properties at that same time `t`. Instead, it is determined by the charge's properties at an earlier time, `tr`, called the **retarded time**. This is the instant when the electromagnetic \"news\" must have left the charge to arrive at the observation point `r` at time `t`.\n\n3.  **Define Key Variables from the Problem Statement:**\n    *   `q`: the point charge.\n    *   `s(t)`: the position vector of the charge as a function of time.\n    *   `r`: the position vector of the observation point (field point).\n    *   `t`: the time of observation.\n    *   `tr`: the retarded time (the time the signal was emitted).\n    *   `d`: the vector from the charge's position at the retarded time `s(tr)` to the observation point `r`. Thus, $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$. Its magnitude is $d = |\\vec{d}|$.\n    *   `v`: the velocity of the charge at the retarded time `tr`. Thus, $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt} |_{t=t_r}$.\n\n4.  **The Retarded Time Condition:** The time it takes for the signal to travel the distance `d` is `d/c`. This must equal the time difference `t - tr`.\n    *   $t - t_r = \\frac{d}{c} = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}$. This is a crucial implicit equation that defines `tr`.\n\n5.  **Start with General Formulas for Retarded Potentials:**\n    The potentials for general charge distributions `ρ` and current distributions `J` are given by:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3\\vec{r}'$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3\\vec{r}'$\n    where $t_r' = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c$.\n\n6.  **Specialize for a Point Charge:** For a point charge `q` moving on a trajectory `s(t)`, the charge and current densities are:\n    $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n    $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\n7.  **Evaluate the Integrals (Derivation Sketch):**\n    Substituting the delta function for `ρ` into the integral for `V` gives:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r'))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3\\vec{r}'$\n    The integral is tricky because `t_r'` inside the delta function also depends on `r'`. Evaluating this integral properly involves a change of variables and calculating a Jacobian determinant. The result of this calculation yields an important correction factor.\n    The volume element gets modified: $d^3r' \\rightarrow \\frac{d^3r'}{1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\hat{d}}{c}}$, where `d` is the vector from source to observer.\n    After integration, the result is:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|} \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{\\vec{v}(t_r) \\cdot (\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{c|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}}$\n\n8.  **Translate to the Problem's Notation:**\n    Using the given definitions `d = r - s(tr)` and `v = v(tr)`:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d} \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{cd}} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n    To match the form in the options, multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\n9.  **Repeat for the Vector Potential A:**\n    The same derivation holds for `A`, which carries an extra factor of `v` from the current density `J = ρv`.\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n    Multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\n10. **Compare with the Options:**\n    Let's check the derived expressions against the given choices.\n    *   **Option A:** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n        This exactly matches our derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n    *   **Option B:** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n        The sign in the denominator is incorrect. The denominator term `(dc - d.v)` accounts for the relativistic Doppler effect. If the charge moves toward the observer, `d.v > 0`, which makes the denominator smaller and the potentials larger, which is physically correct. Option B would predict the opposite.\n\n    *   **Option C:** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$\n        The expression for V is the static Coulomb potential, ignoring retardation and the charge's motion. The formula for A is dimensionally incorrect (A should have units of T·m, while V has units of V).\n\n    *   **Option D:** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$\n        The expression for V is again the incorrect static potential. While the relationship between A and V, $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$, is correct for the actual Liénard-Wiechert potentials (since $\\mu_0\\epsilon_0=1/c^2$), the expression for V itself is wrong.\n\n11. **Conclusion:** Based on the standard derivation of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, option A provides the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.\n\n<<<A>>>"
