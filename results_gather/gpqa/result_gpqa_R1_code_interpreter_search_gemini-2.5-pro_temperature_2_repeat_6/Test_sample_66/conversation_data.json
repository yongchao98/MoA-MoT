    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the initial and final states:**\n    *   The initial state of the two-electron system is given in the coupled angular momentum representation: $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   Here, $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the two electrons.\n    *   $l=2$ and $m=-1$ are the total orbital angular momentum quantum number and its z-component quantum number for the combined system.\n\n2.  **Understand the measurement:**\n    *   A measurement is made of the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum for each electron, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n    *   The state corresponding to a definite measurement of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ is described in the uncoupled basis, denoted by $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle$ or simply $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$ since $l_1$ and $l_2$ are known.\n    *   The eigenvalues of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ are $m_1\\hbar$ and $m_2\\hbar$ respectively.\n\n3.  **Determine the target final state:**\n    *   We are asked for the joint probability of getting the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ as $-\\hbar$ and the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$.\n    *   This corresponds to the measurement outcome where $m_1\\hbar = -\\hbar$ and $m_2\\hbar = -\\hbar$.\n    *   Therefore, the final state we are interested in is the one with quantum numbers $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. This state is written as $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1\\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Apply the principle of angular momentum addition:**\n    *   A fundamental principle when coupling angular momenta is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components.\n    *   Mathematically, this means the quantum number for the total z-component, $m$, must equal the sum of the individual quantum numbers, $m_1 + m_2$.\n    *   $m = m_1 + m_2$\n\n5.  **Check for conservation of the z-component:**\n    *   In the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, the total z-component quantum number is $m = -1$.\n    *   For the desired measurement outcome, the individual quantum numbers are $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   Let's calculate the sum: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   We compare this sum with the initial value of $m$: $-2 \\neq -1$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the probability:**\n    *   The probability of measuring the system in the state $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$ when it is initially in the state $|l, m\\rangle$ is given by the square of the magnitude of the inner product (or projection) of the two states: $P(m_1, m_2) = |\\langle m_1, m_2 | l, m \\rangle|^2$.\n    *   The term $\\langle m_1, m_2 | l, m \\rangle$ is known as the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.\n    *   A crucial property of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is that they are zero unless the condition $m = m_1 + m_2$ is satisfied.\n    *   Since in our case $-1 \\neq -1 + (-1)$, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for this transition is zero.\n    *   Therefore, the inner product $\\langle m_1=-1, m_2=-1 | l=2, m=-1 \\rangle = 0$.\n    *   The probability is the square of this value: $P(m_1=-1, m_2=-1) = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    It is impossible to measure the individual z-components of angular momentum to be $m_1=-1$ and $m_2=-1$ if the total z-component is known to be $m=-1$. The measurement outcome would violate the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. Thus, the probability of this measurement is zero.\n\n<<<D>>>"
