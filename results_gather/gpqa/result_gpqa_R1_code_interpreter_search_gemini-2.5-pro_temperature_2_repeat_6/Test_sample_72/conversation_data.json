    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe user wants to find two physical quantities for a system of two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds:\na) The relative speed (`v_rel`) between them.\nb) The total energy (`E`) of the system.\n\n**2. List the Given Information**\n*   Mass of the first astronaut (`m1`) = 2m\n*   Speed of the first astronaut (`v1`) = 0.6c (in the positive x-direction)\n*   Mass of the second astronaut (`m2`) = 3m\n*   Speed of the second astronaut (`v2`) = 0.5c (in the positive x-direction)\n*   `c` is the speed of light.\n\n**3. Plan the Calculation**\n\n*   **For Relative Speed (`v_rel`):**\n    Since the speeds are relativistic and in the same direction, we cannot simply subtract them. We must use the Lorentz velocity transformation formula (specifically, the velocity subtraction formula). The formula for relative velocity between two objects moving in the same direction is:\n    `v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)`\n\n*   **For Total Energy (`E`):**\n    The total energy of the system is the sum of the total energies of each astronaut.\n    `E_total = E1 + E2`\n    The total energy of a single relativistic particle is given by the formula:\n    `E = γ * m_rest * c^2`\n    where `γ` (gamma, the Lorentz factor) is calculated as:\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2 / c^2)`\n    We will need to calculate the energy for each astronaut (`E1` and `E2`) and then add them together.\n\n**4.

    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\nWe need to find two quantities for a system of two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds:\na) Their relative speed (`v_rel`).\nb) The total energy of the system (`E_total`).\n\n**2. List the Given Information**\n*   Astronaut 1: Rest mass `m₁ = 2m`, velocity `v₁ = 0.6c`.\n*   Astronaut 2: Rest mass `m₂ = 3m`, velocity `v₂ = 0.5c`.\n*   Both are moving in the same direction.\n*   `c` is the speed of light.\n\n**3. Part A: Calculate the Relative Speed (v_rel)**\n\nFor objects moving at speeds close to the speed of light, we cannot simply subtract their velocities. We must use the **Einstein velocity addition/subtraction formula**. Since they are moving in the same direction, the relative velocity `v_rel` between them is:\n\n`v_rel = (v₁ - v₂) / (1 - (v₁ * v₂) / c²)`\n\nNow, substitute the given values:\n`v₁ = 0.6c`\n`v₂ = 0.5c`\n\n`v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3c² / c²)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7`\n`v_rel ≈ 0.142857c`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, we get **`v_rel ≈ 0.14c`**.\n\n**4. Part B: Calculate the Total Energy (E_total)**\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual total energies of the two astronauts.\n`E_total = E₁ + E₂`\n\nThe total energy of a single moving object in relativity is given by the formula:\n`E = γ * m₀ * c²`\nwhere `m₀` is the rest mass and `γ` (gamma, the Lorentz factor) is:\n`γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n**Calculate the energy of Astronaut 1 (E₁):**\n*   Calculate `γ₁`:\n    `γ₁ = 1 / √(1 - v₁²/c²) = 1 / √(1 - (0.6c)²/c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.36) = 1 / √(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25`\n*   Calculate `E₁`:\n    `E₁ = γ₁ * m₁ * c² = 1.25 * (2m) * c² = 2.5 mc²`\n\n**Calculate the energy of Astronaut 2 (E₂):**\n*   Calculate `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 1 / √(1 - v₂²/c²) = 1 / √(1 - (0.5c)²/c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.25) = 1 / √(0.75) ≈ 1 / 0.866 ≈ 1.1547`\n*   Calculate `E₂`:\n    `E₂ = γ₂ * m₂ * c² ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c² ≈ 3.4641 mc²`\n\n**Calculate the Total Energy:**\n`E_total = E₁ + E₂`\n`E_total = 2.5 mc² + 3.4641 mc²`\n`E_total = (2.5 + 3.4641) mc²`\n`E_total = 5.9641 mc²`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, we get **`E_total ≈ 5.96 mc²`**.\n\n**5. Match with Options**\nOur calculated values are:\n*   `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`\n*   `E_total ≈ 5.96 mc²`\n\nThese values correspond to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
