    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the process:**\nThe problem describes a cascade decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ through an intermediate state. The decay occurs via two consecutive electric dipole transitions. We need to determine the specific path (i.e., the intermediate state) and the probability of this path.\n\n**2. Apply Selection Rules for Dipole Transitions:**\nElectric dipole transitions are governed by the following selection rules for the quantum numbers $(n, l, m)$:\n*   **Parity change:** The parity of the state, given by $(-1)^l$, must change. This implies that $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial}$ must be an odd integer. For one-photon dipole transitions, the rule is more restrictive.\n*   **Orbital angular momentum:** $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   **Magnetic quantum number:** $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   **Principal quantum number:** $\\Delta n$ can be any integer. For a decay (emission), $n$ must decrease ($n_{final} < n_{initial}$).\n\n**3. Determine the Intermediate State:**\nThe decay proceeds in two steps:\n*   **Step 1:** Initial state $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ decays to an intermediate state $|int\\rangle = |n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n*   **Step 2:** Intermediate state $|int\\rangle = |n',l',m'\\rangle$ decays to the final state $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\nLet's apply the selection rules to both steps:\n*   **For Step 1 ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$):**\n    *   $l_i = 0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, we must have $l' = 1$.\n    *   $m_i = 0$. To satisfy $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, we can have $m' = 0, 1, -1$.\n    *   For decay, $n'$ must be less than $n_i=3$.\n*   **For Step 2 ($|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    *   $l_f = 0$. To satisfy $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l' = 1$. This is consistent with what we found from Step 1.\n    *   $m_f = 0$. The intermediate state's magnetic quantum number $m'$ must satisfy $m_f - m' = 0 \\Rightarrow m'=0$ or $m_f - m' = \\pm 1 \\Rightarrow m' = \\mp 1$. So, $m'$ can be $0, 1, -1$.\n    *   For decay, $n'$ must be greater than $n_f=1$.\n\nCombining these conditions, the intermediate state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ must have $1 < n' < 3$, which means $n'=2$. It must have $l'=1$, and $m'$ can be $-1, 0, 1$.\nSo, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\nAll the routes proposed in the options A, B, C, and D are valid possible routes for the cascade decay.\n\n**4. Calculate the Transition Probability:**\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific route, for example, $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\nThe overall probability of a cascade is the product of the probabilities of each step:\n$P_{cascade} = P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2})$\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1:** $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle)$\n    This is the branching ratio for the decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ into a specific substate $|2,1,m'\\rangle$. The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an $s$-state, which is spherically symmetric ($Y_{0,0}$ is a constant). Due to this symmetry, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the atom has an equal probability of decaying into any of the three degenerate sublevels of the $2p$ state: $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n    The decay from the $3s$ state can only proceed to a $2p$ state via dipole transition (since $n$ must decrease and $l$ must become 1). There are no other allowed decay channels. So, the total probability of decaying to the $2p$ manifold is 1.\n    Since the three final substates are equally probable, the probability of decaying into any specific one is:\n    $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2:** $P(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle)$\n    Once the atom is in an intermediate state, say $|2,1,0\\rangle$, it will decay further. We need to find the probability that it decays to $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    For an atom in the state $|2,1,0\\rangle$, the only state with lower energy it can decay to via an electric dipole transition is the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state (the $1s$ ground state). The transition is allowed by the selection rules ($\\Delta l = -1, \\Delta m = 0$). Since this is the *only* possible dipole decay channel, the probability of this decay occurring is 1. An atom in the $2p$ state will certainly decay to the $1s$ state.\n    So, $P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$. The same logic applies to the states $|2,1,1\\rangle$ and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n**5. Calculate Total Probability for each option:**\n*   **For options A and B:** Route is $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    The probability is $P(\\text{step 1}) \\times P(\\text{step 2}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   **For option C:** Route is $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    The probability is $P(|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   **For option D:** Route is $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    The probability is $P(|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nComparing our calculated probability with the given options:\nA) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ - Incorrect probability.\nB) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ - Correct route and probability.\nC) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ - Incorrect probability.\nD) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ - Incorrect probability.\n\nThus, option B correctly identifies a possible transition route and its corresponding probability.\n\n<<<B>>>"
