    "**1. Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting compound from the given molecular formula and NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for calculating DoU is C - H/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    DoU = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (3 double bonds + 1 ring). The remaining degree of unsaturation is likely a carbonyl group (C=O). This fits the data well.\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) multiplicity means it is adjacent to a carbon with 2 protons (a -CH2- group), according to the n+1 rule (2+1=3 peaks). This confirms the presence of a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the -CH2- group adjacent to the aldehyde. The doublet (d) multiplicity is because it's coupled to the single aldehyde proton (1+1=2 peaks). This further confirms the -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, are a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is typical for an amine (-NH2) group. The protons are exchangeable, which leads to broadening.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   The two substituents are the -NH2 group and the -CH2-CHO group.\n    *   Let's check if the formula matches: C6H4 (ring) + NH2 + C2H3O (side chain) = C8H(4+2+3)NO = C8H9NO. The formula is correct.\n    *   The starting material is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the sequence of reactions.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde (HOOC-CH2-C6H4-NH2)\n*   **Reaction 1: NaNO2 + HCl**\n    *   These are the reagents for **diazotization**, which converts a primary aromatic amine (Ar-NH2) into a diazonium salt (Ar-N2⁺Cl⁻). This reaction is typically performed at low temperatures (0-5 °C).\n    *   The product after this step is **4-(diazonium chloride)phenylacetaldehyde**. The structure is [Cl⁻N₂⁺]-C₆H₄-CH₂-CHO.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: H2O (usually with warming)**\n    *   Aromatic diazonium salts are unstable and react with water upon gentle warming. The diazonium group (-N₂⁺) is an excellent leaving group, and it is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group from water. Nitrogen gas (N₂) is evolved.\n    *   The product after this step is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**. The structure is HO-C₆H₄-CH₂-CHO.\n\n*   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   This is a strong base (KOH) with heat. The reactant is an aldehyde (4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde) that possesses alpha-hydrogens (the protons on the -CH₂- group next to the aldehyde).\n    *   Aldehydes with alpha-hydrogens undergo a base-catalyzed **Aldol Condensation** under these conditions. This is a two-part process: an aldol addition followed by a dehydration.\n    *   **Part A: Aldol Addition:** The base (OH⁻) removes an acidic alpha-hydrogen to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon of another molecule of the aldehyde. Protonation of the resulting alkoxide yields an aldol addition product.\n        *   **Enolate formation:** [HO-C₆H₄-CH-CHO]⁻\n        *   **Nucleophilic attack:** The enolate attacks a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n        *   **Addition Product:** After protonation, the product is 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal. This corresponds to **option A**.\n        \n        *Structure of the Aldol Addition Product:*\n        ```\n              OH\n              |\n        HO-C₆H₄-CH₂-CH-CH(C₆H₄-OH)-CHO \n        ```\n    *   **Part B: Dehydration (Condensation):** The word \"**Heat**\" is crucial. It provides the energy for the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. The -OH group from C-3 and the acidic alpha-hydrogen from C-2 are eliminated to form a double bond. This dehydration is highly favored because it creates a large, stable conjugated system (Aryl-C=C-C=O).\n        \n        *Structure of the Aldol Condensation Product:*\n        ```\n        HO-C₆H₄-CH₂-CH=C(C₆H₄-OH)-CHO \n        ```\n        Let's name this final product: The parent chain is a four-carbon aldehyde with a double bond at C-2, so it's a **but-2-enal**. It has 4-hydroxyphenyl groups at positions C-2 and C-4. The name is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This corresponds to **option B**.\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion.**\n\nThe sequence of reactions transforms 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde into 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, which then undergoes a self-condensation under basic, heated conditions. The final stable product is the dehydrated aldol condensation product.\n\n*   Option A is the aldol *addition* product, which is an intermediate.\n*   Option B is the aldol *condensation* product, which is the final product formed with heat.\n*   Options C and D are incorrect based on the reaction mechanism and stoichiometry.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<B>>>"
