    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical equilibrium.** The problem involves the dissociation of the calcium-EDTA complex ($CaY^{2-}$), where Y represents the EDTA ligand. The complex is in equilibrium with its constituent ions, calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) and the EDTA ligand ($Y^{4-}$). The dissociation reaction is:\n    $CaY^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Understand the given constant.** The problem provides the formation constant ($K_f$ or $K_{Ca-EDTA}$), which describes the formation of the complex from its ions:\n    $Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons CaY^{2-}$\n    The expression for the formation constant is:\n    $K_f = \\frac{[CaY^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]}$\n    We are given $K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10}$. The note about \"ideal pH\" implies that we can use this formation constant directly without needing to consider the pH-dependent speciation of EDTA.\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table.** We can analyze the dissociation of the complex to find the equilibrium concentrations. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n\n| Species         | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :-------------- | :---------- | :--------- | :---------------- |\n| $CaY^{2-}$      | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x          |\n| $Ca^{2+}$       | 0           | +x         | x                 |\n| $Y^{4-}$        | 0           | +x         | x                 |\n\n4.  **Substitute equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression.**\n    $K_f = \\frac{[CaY^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n5.  **Simplify the equation with an assumption.** The formation constant ($5 \\times 10^{10}$) is very large, which means the equilibrium strongly favors the complex ($CaY^{2-}$). Therefore, the amount that dissociates (x) will be extremely small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can make the simplifying assumption:\n    $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\n6.  **Solve for x.** The equation now becomes:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n    Rearranging to solve for $x^2$:\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 0.4 \\times 10^{-12} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    Now, solve for x (which represents the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ ions):\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n    To calculate the square root, we can write $4 \\times 10^{-13}$ as $40 \\times 10^{-14}$:\n    $x = \\sqrt{40 \\times 10^{-14}} = \\sqrt{40} \\times \\sqrt{10^{-14}} = \\sqrt{40} \\times 10^{-7}$\n    Since $\\sqrt{36} = 6$ and $\\sqrt{49} = 7$, $\\sqrt{40}$ is approximately 6.3.\n    $x \\approx 6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n7.  **Verify the assumption.** Is $x \\ll 0.02$? Yes, $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ is much, much smaller than $0.02$, so our assumption was valid. The concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is x.\n\n8.  **Compare with the given options.** The calculated value, $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M, matches option C.\n\nLet's use a small Python script to perform the calculation with higher precision.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex\nC = 0.02  # M\n\n# Formation constant of the Ca-EDTA complex\nK = 5e10\n\n# We need to solve for x in the equation: K = (C - x) / x^2\n# Rearranging gives the quadratic equation: K*x^2 + x - C = 0\n# Where a = K, b = 1, c = -C\n\na = K\nb = 1\nc = -C\n\n# Using the quadratic formula: x = (-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a)\n# We take the positive root because concentration cannot be negative.\ndiscriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c\nx = (-b + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)\n\nprint(f\"{x:.2e}\")\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The thinking process and calculation are as follows:\n\n1.  **Define the Chemical Equilibrium:** The dissociation of the Calcium-EDTA complex ($CaY^{2-}$) is the reverse of its formation. The problem provides the formation constant ($K_f$ or $K_{Ca-EDTA}$). The dissociation reaction is:\n    $CaY^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Set up an ICE Table:** We start with an initial concentration of the complex and assume it dissociates to reach equilibrium. Let 'x' be the change in concentration.\n    *   **Reaction:** $CaY^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n    *   **Initial (I):** 0.02 M | 0 M | 0 M\n    *   **Change (C):** -x | +x | +x\n    *   **Equilibrium (E):** (0.02 - x) M | x M | x M\n\n3.  **Use the Formation Constant ($K_f$):** The equilibrium expression for the formation constant is:\n    $K_f = \\frac{[CaY^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]}$\n\n4.  **Substitute Equilibrium Concentrations:**\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{(0.02 - x)}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n5.  **Apply a Simplifying Assumption:** Since the formation constant ($K_f$) is very large ($5 \\times 10^{10}$), the equilibrium lies far to the right for formation, meaning the complex is very stable and dissociates very little. Therefore, 'x' will be extremely small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can assume:\n    $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\n6.  **Solve for x:** The equation simplifies to:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n    Now, rearrange and solve for x, which represents the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ ions:\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 0.4 \\times 10^{-12} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    $x \\approx \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7} \\, M$\n\n7.  **Validate the Assumption:** The calculated value of $x = 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ is much smaller than 0.02, confirming that our assumption was valid.\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated concentration of calcium ions, $6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M, is closest to option C. The Python code output `6.32e-07` confirms this calculation precisely.\n\n<<<C>>>"
