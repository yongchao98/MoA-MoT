    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Molecular Information:**\n\n*   **Core Structure:** A 6-membered aromatic ring (a benzene ring), which accounts for 6 carbon atoms.\n*   **Total Carbons:** The compound has 8 carbon atoms in total. This means the two substituents on the benzene ring must contain a combined total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **Substituents:** The ring is di-substituted.\n*   **FTIR Clues:**\n    *   A **carbonyl group (C=O)** is present.\n    *   An **aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X)** is present. This means one of the substituents is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I).\n\n**2. Deduce the Structure of the Substituents:**\n\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X).\n*   The other substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n*   Let's consider possible structures for this C2-carbonyl substituent:\n    *   **Acetyl group:** -C(=O)CH₃. This has 2 carbons and a carbonyl.\n    *   **Formylmethyl group:** -CH₂CHO. This also has 2 carbons and a carbonyl.\n    *   Other possibilities like -CH₂COOH or -COOCH₃ exist, but they introduce a second oxygen atom which isn't specified (though not explicitly ruled out).\n\n**3. Determine Plausible Molecular Structures:**\n\nBased on the above, two main structural isomers are highly plausible:\n\n*   **Structure I (Ketone):** A halogen and an acetyl group on the benzene ring. The formula would be X-C₆H₄-C(=O)CH₃. This is a halo-acetophenone.\n*   **Structure II (Aldehyde):** A halogen and a formylmethyl group on the benzene ring. The formula would be X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO. This is a halo-phenylacetaldehyde.\n\nBoth structures have 8 carbons, a di-substituted aromatic ring, a carbonyl group, and an aromatic-halogen bond.\n\n**4. Analyze the 1H NMR Options:**\n\nLet's predict the NMR spectra for our plausible structures and compare them to the given options. We will pay close attention to the number of signals, their chemical shifts (δ), their integration (number of protons), and their splitting pattern (s, d, t, etc.).\n\nA key feature in options B and D is the pattern **δ 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d)**. This is a classic textbook pattern for a **para (1,4) disubstituted** benzene ring where the two substituents are electronically different. This simplifies our structural possibilities to 1-halo-4-acetylbenzene (Structure I, para) or 1-halo-4-(formylmethyl)benzene (Structure II, para).\n\n*   **Option A) 1H NMR: δ 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This is incorrect. It only shows one aromatic proton, whereas a di-substituted benzene ring must have four.\n\n*   **Option C) 1H NMR: δ 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This is incorrect. It shows no signals in the aromatic region (typically δ 6.5-8.5 ppm), which is impossible for a compound containing an aromatic ring.\n\n*   **Option D) 1H NMR: δ 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Aromatic region:** δ 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d). This matches a para-disubstituted ring. The downfield shifts (7.6-7.8 ppm) indicate the ring is attached to electron-withdrawing groups.\n    *   **Aliphatic region:** δ 2.3 (3H, s). This is a singlet for 3 protons, which is characteristic of a methyl (-CH₃) group that has no adjacent protons.\n    *   **Matching Structure:** This spectrum perfectly matches **Structure I (the ketone, 1-halo-4-acetylbenzene)**.\n        *   The two doublets are the four aromatic protons.\n        *   The singlet at ~2.3 ppm is the methyl of the acetyl group (-C(=O)**CH₃**). It's a singlet because the adjacent carbonyl carbon has no protons.\n        *   The chemical shift of ~2.3 ppm is typical for a methyl ketone. The downfield aromatic signals are also consistent with the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the acetyl group being directly attached to the ring.\n\n*   **Option B) 1H NMR: δ 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Aromatic region:** δ 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d). Also suggests a para-disubstituted ring.\n    *   **Low-field region:** δ 9.9 (1H, s). A signal at this chemical shift is characteristic of an **aldehyde proton (-CHO)**.\n    *   **Aliphatic region:** δ 3.7 (2H, s). This is a singlet for 2 protons, likely a methylene (-CH₂-) group with no adjacent protons.\n    *   **Matching Structure:** This spectrum seems to describe **Structure II (the aldehyde, 1-halo-4-(formylmethyl)benzene)**.\n    *   **Inconsistency Check:** Let's look closer. In Structure II (X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO), the electron-withdrawing carbonyl group is insulated from the ring by a CH₂ group. Its effect on the aromatic protons would be weaker than the direct attachment in the ketone. Therefore, the aromatic protons should be more shielded (at a lower ppm value) than in the ketone. Chemical shifts of 7.8 and 7.6 ppm are too far downfield (too deshielded) for this structure; values closer to 7.1-7.4 ppm would be expected. The spectrum in option D is far more consistent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe NMR data in Option D is highly consistent with the structure of a 4'-haloacetophenone (Structure I). The aromatic signals reflect a para-substituted ring with a strong electron-withdrawing group attached, and the 3H singlet at 2.3 ppm perfectly represents the methyl of the acetyl group. The data in Option B contains a significant inconsistency in the chemical shifts of the aromatic protons.\n\nTherefore, Option D is the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
