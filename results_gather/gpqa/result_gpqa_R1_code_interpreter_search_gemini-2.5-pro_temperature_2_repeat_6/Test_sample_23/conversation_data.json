    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance Z**\n\n1.  Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n    The mass fraction of hydrogen in a hydrocarbon CnHm is given by `m / (12n + m)`.\n    `m / (12n + m) = 0.1428`\n    This value is very close to 1/7 (`1/7 â‰ˆ 0.142857`).\n    `m / (12n + m) = 1/7`\n    `7m = 12n + m`\n    `6m = 12n`\n    `m = 2n`\n    So, the general formula for Z is `CnH2n`.\n\n2.  Z is formed by the hydrogenation of other compounds (from mixtures X and Y) and does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a saturated hydrocarbon.\n\n3.  The general formula for a saturated acyclic hydrocarbon (alkane) is `CnH(2n+2)`. The general formula for a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon (cycloalkane) is `CnH2n`.\n\n4.  Since the formula for Z is `CnH2n` and it is saturated, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n\n5.  Z is also described as a widely used solvent. A very common cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. Let's assume Z is cyclohexane. The carbon skeleton of all compounds involved must therefore be a six-membered ring.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Mixture Y**\n\n1.  Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that is formed from mixture X.\n2.  Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated (like alkanes/cycloalkanes) or aromatic. They cannot be alkenes or alkynes.\n3.  Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only one substance, Z (cyclohexane).\n4.  One component of Y is Z itself (cyclohexane, C6H12), as stated in the problem.\n5.  The other component of Y must also hydrogenate to form cyclohexane. For it to not be an alkene but still react with hydrogen under severe conditions, it must be an aromatic compound. The only aromatic compound with a 6-carbon skeleton is **benzene (C6H6)**.\n6.  The hydrogenation of benzene produces cyclohexane: `C6H6 + 3H2 -> C6H12`.\n7.  Thus, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **benzene (C6H6)** and **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. This fits the description, as neither readily decolorizes bromine water, and hydrogenating the mixture (hydrogenating the benzene and leaving the cyclohexane unreacted) yields pure cyclohexane.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Mixture X and the Reaction**\n\n1.  Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water, meaning at least one (and likely both, based on the phrasing) of its components is an alkene.\n2.  The components of X do not have conjugated multiple bonds. This rules out 1,3-cyclohexadiene.\n3.  The hydrogenation of mixture X gives only cyclohexane (Z), so both components of X must be C6 cyclic compounds that can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane.\n4.  The reaction from X to Y is described as a disproportionation. In this context, it means a hydrogen transfer reaction where one component is oxidized (loses hydrogen) and another is reduced (gains hydrogen).\n    `Mixture X (A+B) --(Pt, heat)--> Mixture Y (Benzene + Cyclohexane)`\n5.  We need to find two C6 cyclic alkenes (A and B) that can react in a 1:1 molar ratio to produce benzene and cyclohexane in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n    Let A be oxidized to benzene (C6H6).\n    Let B be reduced to cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    The reaction would be a hydrogen transfer: `A + B -> C6H6 + C6H12`.\n6.  For the atom count to balance, the total atoms in `A + B` must equal the total atoms in `C6H6 + C6H12` (which is C12H18).\n7.  The logical candidates for A and B (non-conjugated C6 cyclic alkenes) are **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n8.  Let's check if they fit the reaction:\n    `C6H8 + C6H10 -> C6H6 + C6H12`\n    Reactants: C: 6+6=12, H: 8+10=18 -> C12H18\n    Products: C: 6+6=12, H: 6+12=18 -> C12H18\n    The stoichiometry is balanced.\n9.  In this reaction, 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) is oxidized to benzene (C6H6) by losing two hydrogen atoms. Cyclohexene (C6H10) is reduced to cyclohexane (C6H12) by gaining two hydrogen atoms. This is a plausible catalytic hydrogen transfer.\n10. So, Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)** and **cyclohexene (C6H10)**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of the hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n-   Component 1: Cyclohexene (C6H10) has **10** hydrogen atoms.\n-   Component 2: 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) has **8** hydrogen atoms.\n\nTotal number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
