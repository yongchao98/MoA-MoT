    "**1. Reasoning and Analysis**\n\nTo determine if a compound shows optical isomerism, we need to assess if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality are the presence of a chiral center or an axis of chirality (like in atropisomers). A molecule is achiral (and thus does not show optical isomerism) if it possesses a plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion (i).\n\nLet's examine each compound:\n\n*   **1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:**\n    *   This is a substituted biphenyl. Biphenyls can exhibit a special type of chirality called atropisomerism.\n    *   Atropisomerism arises when there is a significant energy barrier to rotation around a single bond. In this case, it's the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings.\n    *   The bulky substituents at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6')—two nitro groups (-NO2) and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3)—provide strong steric hindrance.\n    *   This steric hindrance prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely and becoming coplanar. The molecule is forced into a twisted, non-planar conformation.\n    *   Because of this fixed, twisted shape and the specific substitution pattern, the molecule does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Its mirror image is non-superimposable.\n    *   Therefore, it is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   This is an ester, also known as methyl lactate. Its structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n    *   Let's analyze the central carbon atom (C2), which is bonded to the hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   This carbon atom is attached to four different groups:\n        1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH3 (a methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH3 (a methyl carboxylate group)\n    *   A carbon atom bonded to four different groups is a stereocenter (or chiral center).\n    *   Any molecule containing a single stereocenter is chiral.\n    *   Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is chiral and exists as a pair of enantiomers, meaning it shows optical isomerism.\n\n*   **3. benzophenone:**\n    *   The structure of benzophenone is a central carbonyl group (C=O) attached to two phenyl rings (C6H5).\n    *   The molecule has a C2 axis of symmetry passing through the C=O bond.\n    *   More importantly, there is a plane of symmetry that contains the C=O group and bisects the angle between the two identical phenyl rings.\n    *   The presence of a plane of symmetry means the molecule's mirror image is superimposable on the original molecule.\n    *   Therefore, benzophenone is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **4. dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   This molecule is the *trans*-isomer of dimethyl butenedioate. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the ester groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   Due to the C=C double bond, the molecule is planar. Any planar molecule has the plane of the molecule itself as a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Additionally, this molecule possesses a center of inversion (a point at the center of the C=C bond through which an inversion operation results in an identical molecule).\n    *   The presence of a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, compounds 1 (dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate) and 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) are chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and will not.\n\nThus, the correct choice includes compounds 1 and 2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
