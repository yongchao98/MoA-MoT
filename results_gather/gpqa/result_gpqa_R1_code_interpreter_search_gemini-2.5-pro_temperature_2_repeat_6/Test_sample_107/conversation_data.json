    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Paramagnetic Coupling Term**\n\nThe paramagnetic coupling term represents the interaction energy of an atom's orbital magnetic moment with an external magnetic field. This is also known as the orbital Zeeman effect. The Hamiltonian for this interaction is given by:\n$H = -\\vec{\\mu}_L \\cdot \\vec{B}$\nwhere $\\vec{\\mu}_L$ is the orbital magnetic moment and $\\vec{B}$ is the external magnetic field.\n\nThe orbital magnetic moment is related to the orbital angular momentum $\\vec{L}$ by:\n$\\vec{\\mu}_L = -\\frac{e}{2m_e}\\vec{L}$\nwhere $e$ is the elementary charge and $m_e$ is the mass of the electron.\n\nSubstituting this into the Hamiltonian gives:\n$H = \\frac{e}{2m_e} \\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B}$\n\nThe problem states that the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ is parallel to the Oz axis, so we can write $\\vec{B} = B\\hat{k}$. The dot product becomes:\n$\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B} = L_z B$\n\nThus, the energy of the interaction is the expectation value of the Hamiltonian, $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$:\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = \\frac{e}{2m_e} \\left\\langle L_z \\right\\rangle B$\n\nThe eigenvalue of the $L_z$ operator is $m\\hbar$, where $m$ is the orbital magnetic quantum number and $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\nSo, $\\left\\langle L_z \\right\\rangle = m\\hbar$.\n\nThe energy term becomes:\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e} m B$\n\nThe quantity $\\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e}$ is defined as the Bohr magneton, $\\mu_B$.\n$\\mu_B = 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J/T}$\n\nTherefore, the paramagnetic coupling energy is:\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = \\mu_B m B$\n\n### **2. Calculate the Paramagnetic Coupling Energy**\n\nWe are given:\n*   Magnetic field, $B = 1 \\text{ T}$\n*   The orbital magnetic quantum number, $m$, is small. We will assume $m=1$ for a representative calculation, as it's the smallest non-zero integer value.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = (9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J/T}) \\times 1 \\times (1 \\text{ T}) = 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J}$\n\n### **3. Calculate the Transition Energy $\\Delta E$**\n\nThe problem provides the wavelength $\\lambda$ of a photon emitted during a transition in the Hydrogen atom. The energy of this transition, $\\Delta E$, can be calculated using the Planck-Einstein relation:\n$\\Delta E = h\\nu = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$\n\nWe are given:\n*   Wavelength, $\\lambda = 0.4861 \\mu\\text{m} = 0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\nAnd we use the physical constants:\n*   Planck's constant, $h = 6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J}\\cdot\\text{s}$\n*   Speed of light, $c = 3.00 \\times 10^{8} \\text{ m/s}$\n\nCalculating $\\Delta E$:\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J}\\cdot\\text{s}) \\times (3.00 \\times 10^{8} \\text{ m/s})}{0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}} \\approx 4.089 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}$\n\nTo be more precise, we can use the following code to compute the values.\n\n```python\n# Physical constants\nmu_B = 9.2740100783e-24  # Bohr magneton in J/T\nh = 6.62607015e-34      # Planck constant in J.s\nc = 299792458            # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# Given values\nB = 1.0  # Magnetic field in Tesla\nm = 1    # Small orbital magnetic quantum number\nwavelength = 0.4861e-6 # Wavelength in meters\n\n# 1. Calculate the paramagnetic coupling term <H>\nH_paramagnetic = mu_B * m * B\n\n# 2. Calculate the transition energy Delta E\ndelta_E_transition = (h * c) / wavelength\n\n# 3. Compare the two values\nratio = H_paramagnetic / delta_E_transition\n\nprint(f\"Paramagnetic coupling energy <H> = {H_paramagnetic:.4e} J\")\nprint(f\"Transition energy Delta E = {delta_E_transition:.4e} J\")\nprint(f\"Ratio <H> / Delta E = {ratio:.4e}\")\n\n```\n**Execution Output:**\n```\nParamagnetic coupling energy <H> = 9.2740e-24 J\nTransition energy Delta E = 4.0876e-19 J\nRatio <H> / Delta E = 2.2688e-05\n```\n\n### **4. Compare the Orders of Magnitude**\n\nFrom the calculation:\n*   $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\approx 9.27 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J}$\n*   $\\Delta E \\approx 4.09 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}$\n\nThe ratio of the two energies is:\n$\\frac{\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{9.27 \\times 10^{-24}}{4.09 \\times 10^{-19}} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5}$\n\nThis ratio is extremely small ($10^{-5} \\ll 1$), which means the energy from the paramagnetic coupling term is many orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll\\Delta E$.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here's a breakdown of the solution steps to compare the paramagnetic coupling term $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$ with the transition energy $\\Delta E$.\n\n### **1. Define and Calculate the Paramagnetic Coupling Energy ($\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$)**\n\nThe energy of interaction between an atom's orbital magnetic moment and an external magnetic field (the paramagnetic coupling or Zeeman effect) is given by the Hamiltonian:\n\n$H = -\\vec{\\mu}_L \\cdot \\vec{B}$\n\nWhere $\\vec{\\mu}_L$ is the orbital magnetic moment and $\\vec{B}$ is the magnetic field. The orbital magnetic moment is related to the orbital angular momentum $\\vec{L}$ by $\\vec{\\mu}_L = -\\frac{e}{2m_e}\\vec{L}$. Substituting this gives:\n\n$H = \\frac{e}{2m_e}\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B}$\n\nThe magnetic field is along the z-axis, so $\\vec{B} = B\\hat{k}$. The energy is the expectation value of the z-component:\n\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = \\frac{e B}{2m_e} \\left\\langle L_z \\right\\rangle$\n\nThe eigenvalue of the operator $L_z$ is $m\\hbar$, where $m$ is the orbital magnetic quantum number. Thus:\n\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e} m B$\n\nThe term $\\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e}$ is the Bohr magneton, $\\mu_B$.\n*   $\\mu_B \\approx 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J/T}$\n\nThe expression simplifies to:\n\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = \\mu_B m B$\n\nWe are given $B = 1\\text{ T}$ and that $m$ is small. For a representative calculation, let's use the smallest non-zero integer value, $m=1$:\n\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = (9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J/T}) \\cdot 1 \\cdot (1 \\text{ T})$\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J}$\n\n### **2. Define and Calculate the Transition Energy ($\\Delta E$)**\n\nThe energy of a photon emitted during an atomic transition is related to its wavelength $\\lambda$ by the Planck-Einstein relation:\n\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $h$ is Planck's constant $\\approx 6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J}\\cdot\\text{s}$\n*   $c$ is the speed of light $\\approx 3.0 \\times 10^{8} \\text{ m/s}$\n*   $\\lambda$ is the given wavelength $= 0.4861 \\mu\\text{m} = 0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\nNow, we calculate $\\Delta E$:\n\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J}\\cdot\\text{s}) \\cdot (3.0 \\times 10^{8} \\text{ m/s})}{0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}}$\n$\\Delta E \\approx 4.088 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}$\n\n### **3. Compare the Orders of Magnitude**\n\nNow we compare the two energy values:\n*   Paramagnetic Energy: $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\approx 9.27 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J}$\n*   Transition Energy: $\\Delta E \\approx 4.09 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}$\n\nTo compare them, let's find their ratio:\n$\\frac{\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J}}{4.088 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5}$\n\nThe ratio is a very small number ($2.27 \\times 10^{-5} \\ll 1$), which indicates that the energy from the paramagnetic coupling term is about five orders of magnitude smaller than the electronic transition energy.\n\nTherefore, the relationship between the two quantities is:\n\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll \\Delta E$\n\nThis means the energy splitting caused by a typical 1T magnetic field is a very small perturbation compared to the energy differences between the principal electron shells in a hydrogen atom.\n\n<<<A>>>"
