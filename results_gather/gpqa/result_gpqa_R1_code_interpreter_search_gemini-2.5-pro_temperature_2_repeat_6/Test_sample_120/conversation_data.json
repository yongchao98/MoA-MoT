    "Here's a detailed step-by-step reasoning to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Starting Material (Epoxide)\n\nThe reactant is **(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane**.\n\n*   **Core Structure:** `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` represents a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across two adjacent carbons. The IUPAC bicyclo numbering scheme designates these carbons as C1 and C6. C7 is the epoxide oxygen.\n*   **Substituents:** Methyl groups are located at C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The absolute configuration at the chiral centers is given as 1R, 3R, 4R, 6S.\n\nTo determine the structure, we must first assign Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities for each chiral center.\nLet's draw a planar hexagon for the cyclohexane ring, numbered C1 to C6 clockwise, with the epoxide oxygen (C7) pointing \"up\" (represented by a wedge).\n\n*   **Priorities at C1:** Attached groups are -O(7), -C2, -C6, -Me.\n    *   -O > C. To compare -C2 and -C6, we look at the paths around the ring. The path C1-C2-C3... has a methyl group at C3. The path C1-C6-C5... has its first methyl group further away at C4. Following IUPAC rules for complex rings, the path through C2 is preferred over C6.\n    *   Priorities: -O > -C2 > -C6 > -Me.\n\n*   **Priorities at C6:** Attached groups are -O(7), -C1, -C5, -H.\n    *   The C1 substituent is C(Me,O,C), while C5 is CH2. Thus, C1 has a higher priority than C5.\n    *   Priorities: -O > -C1 > -C5 > -H.\n\n*   **Priorities at C3:** Attached groups are -C2, -C4, -Me, -H.\n    *   C2 is bonded to C1(which has O, Me). C4 is bonded to C(Me). Path C3->C2 leads to the epoxide oxygen faster.\n    *   Priorities: -C2 > -C4 > -Me > -H.\n\n*   **Priorities at C4:** Attached groups are -C3, -C5, -Me, -H.\n    *   C3 has a methyl substituent. C5 does not. So, C3 > C5.\n    *   Priorities: -C3 > -C5 > -Me > -H.\n\nNow we can determine the 3D arrangement from the given R/S configuration. Let's assume the epoxide oxygen is \"up\" (wedge).\n\n*   **C1 (R):** Priorities: O(1)>C2(2)>C6(3)>Me(4). To obtain 'R', the path 1→2→3 must be clockwise when the lowest priority group (4) is in the back. Visualizing on the flat ring (O up, C2 right, C6 left), the path O→C2→C6 is clockwise. This requires the methyl group (Me) to be \"down\" (dash).\n*   **C6 (S):** Priorities: O(1)>C1(2)>C5(3)>H(4). The path O→C1→C5 is counter-clockwise. To be 'S', the lowest priority group (H) must be \"down\" (dash).\n*   **C3 (R):** Priorities: C2(1)>C4(2)>Me(3)>H(4). The path C2→C4→Me is counter-clockwise. For the configuration to be 'R', the lowest priority group (H) must be \"up\" (wedge). This means the methyl group (Me) is \"down\" (dash).\n*   **C4 (R):** Priorities: C3(1)>C5(2)>Me(3)>H(4). The path C3→C5→Me is clockwise. For the configuration to be 'R', the lowest priority group (H) must be \"down\" (dash). This means the methyl group (Me) is \"up\" (wedge).\n\n**Summary of reactant's relative stereochemistry:**\n*   Epoxide Oxygen: **Up**\n*   C1-Methyl: **Down**\n*   C6-Hydrogen: **Down**\n*   C3-Methyl: **Down**\n*   C4-Methyl: **Up**\n\n### 2. Analyze the Reaction\n\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent) is a source of a soft nucleophile, Me⁻.\n*   **Reaction Type:** Nucleophilic opening of an epoxide.\n*   **Regioselectivity:** Organocuprates attack the **less sterically hindered** carbon of the epoxide.\n    *   C1 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, Me).\n    *   C6 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, H).\n    *   Therefore, the nucleophilic attack will occur at **C6**.\n*   **Stereoselectivity:** The attack is an Sₙ2 reaction, occurring with **inversion of configuration** at the attacked carbon. The nucleophile attacks from the side opposite the C-O bond.\n\n### 3. Predict the Product Structure\n\n1.  The nucleophile (Me⁻) attacks C6 from the \"down\" side (anti to the \"up\" C-O bond).\n2.  The C6-O bond breaks. The epoxide opens. After acidic workup, the oxygen on C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group. Its stereochemistry is retained.\n3.  The configuration at C6 is inverted as the new C-Me bond forms.\n\n**Tracing the stereochemistry into the product:**\n\n*   **At C1:** The C-O bond becomes C-OH. The oxygen was \"up\", so the OH is **up**. The methyl group on C1 was \"down\" and is unaffected. So, at C1 we have OH (up) and Me (down).\n*   **At C6 (becomes C2 in product):** Attacked by Me from \"down\", so the new Me group is **down**. The H atom at C6, which was \"down\", undergoes inversion and is now **up**.\n*   **At C3 (becomes C5 in product):** Unaffected. Me remains **down**.\n*   **At C4 (becomes C4 in product):** Unaffected. Me remains **up**.\n\n**The resulting product is a cyclohexanol. We need to determine its IUPAC name:**\n*   **Parent name:** The -OH group gets priority for numbering, so it is a cyclohexan-1-ol.\n*   **Substituents:** There are four methyl groups. Their locations (following the reaction) are at C1, C2(old C6), C4(old C4), and C5(old C3). The IUPAC name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches options B and C.\n*   **Final stereochemistry:** We must assign R/S to the chiral centers (C1, C2, C4, C5) of the product.\n    *   C4 and C5 were untouched, so their configurations remain **4R** and **5R** (reactant C3(R) -> product C5(R)). This eliminates option D.\n    *   **Configuration at C1:** Priorities: OH(1) > C2(2) > C6(3) > Me(4). Product C1 has OH(up) and Me(down). The lowest priority group (Me) is \"down\" (dash). The path OH→C2→C6 is clockwise. Therefore, **C1 is R**.\n    *   **Configuration at C2:** Priorities: C1(1) > C3(2) > Me(3) > H(4). Product C2 has H(up) and Me(down). The lowest priority group (H) is \"up\" (wedge). The path C1→C3→Me is clockwise. Because the lowest priority group is up (wedge), we reverse the result. Clockwise → S. Therefore, **C2 is S**.\n\nCombining these results, the product's absolute configuration is (1R, 2S, 4R, 5R).\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe final product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
