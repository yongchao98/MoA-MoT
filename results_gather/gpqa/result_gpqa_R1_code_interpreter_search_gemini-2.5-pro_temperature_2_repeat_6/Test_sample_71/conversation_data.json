    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n1.  **Step 1: 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene + 2 eq. 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene + NaI at elevated temperature → Product 1**\n    *   **Reactant A:** 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene is a norbornadiene derivative. Norbornadiene has two double bonds and typically acts as a dienophile in Diels-Alder reactions. The two double bonds are equivalent, and the bulky tert-butoxy group on the C7 bridge directs incoming reagents to the *exo* face.\n    *   **Reactant B:** `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` is a complex molecule. Its reaction with sodium iodide (NaI) at elevated temperatures strongly suggests the *in situ* generation of a reactive species that will participate in the main reaction. The most likely role for this species is to act as a diene in a Diels-Alder reaction.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** The overall reaction is a double Diels-Alder reaction, where two molecules of a diene (let's call it 'X'), generated from reactant B, add across the two double bonds of the norbornadiene derivative.\n    *   **Product 1:** This is the resulting bis-adduct, a large polycyclic ether.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 + aqueous sulfuric acid → Product 2**\n    *   This is a standard deprotection reaction. The aqueous acid will cleave the tert-butyl ether to form an alcohol.\n    *   `R-O-tBu + H₂O/H⁺ → R-OH + isobutene`\n    *   **Product 2:** The alcohol corresponding to Product 1.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 + SO₃/pyridine in DMSO → Product 3**\n    *   This is a Parikh-Doering oxidation, which is a mild method to oxidize a primary or secondary alcohol to an aldehyde or ketone, respectively. Here, the secondary alcohol at the C7 position is oxidized to a ketone.\n    *   **Product 3:** The ketone corresponding to Product 2. It's a complex polycyclic ketone.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 heated at 150°C → Product 4**\n    *   Heating a complex Diels-Alder adduct often leads to a retro-Diels-Alder reaction. The temperature of 150°C is relatively mild but sufficient for many retro-cycloadditions, especially if a stable molecule is eliminated.\n    *   The reaction would be: `Product 3 ⇌ 7-norbornadienone + 2 \"X\"` (where X is the diene from step 1).\n    *   The core of Product 3 comes from 7-(tert-butoxy)norbornadiene. After deprotection and oxidation, this core becomes **7-norbornadienone**.\n    *   This implies that Product 3, under heat, reverts to its constituent parts: 7-norbornadienone and two molecules of the diene 'X'. The question is what happens to the highly unstable 7-norbornadienone.\n\n**Identifying the Final Product 4**\n\n*   **The Fate of 7-Norbornadienone:** 7-Norbornadienone is known to be thermally unstable. Its fate is the key to identifying Product 4. There are two main decomposition pathways:\n    1.  **Photochemical decarbonylation:** Loss of carbon monoxide (CO) to yield benzene (C₆H₆).\n    2.  **Thermal rearrangement:** While thermal decarbonylation is possible at much higher temperatures, a more accessible thermal pathway for strained ketones can be rearrangement.\n*   Let's analyze the common products:\n    *   **Benzene (from decarbonylation):** Benzene is highly symmetric (D₆h) and has only one type of proton. This would give 1 signal in the ¹H NMR spectrum, which is not an option.\n    *   **Retro-Diels-Alder of 7-Norbornadienone itself:** 7-Norbornadiene is a Diels-Alder adduct of cyclopentadiene and acetylene. Therefore, 7-norbornadienone is an adduct of **cyclopentadienone** and acetylene. A retro-Diels-Alder reaction would yield these two species. Cyclopentadienone is unstable and rapidly dimerizes. The resulting dimer has low symmetry and many signals (>6). This doesn't match the options.\n    *   **Rearrangement to Phenol:** A plausible, though less common, thermal rearrangement pathway for the highly strained 7-norbornadienone (C₇H₆O) could lead to its more stable isomer, **phenol** (C₆H₅OH), via a complex mechanism likely involving extrusion of a carbon atom (perhaps as CO, requiring an atom-scrambling skeletal rearrangement first). While the mechanism is non-trivial, the formation of a stable aromatic product is a strong thermodynamic driving force.\n\n**Counting the ¹H NMR Signals for Phenol**\n\nLet's assume Product 4 is **Phenol**.\n\n```\n      OH\n     /  \\\n   //    \\\\\n  ||      ||\n   \\\\    //\n     \\  /\n      \\/\n```\n\nPhenol has a plane of symmetry passing through the C1-OH bond and the C4 atom. Due to this symmetry:\n1.  The proton on the hydroxyl group (–OH) is unique. (Signal 1)\n2.  The two ortho-protons (at C2 and C6) are chemically equivalent. (Signal 2)\n3.  The two meta-protons (at C3 and C5) are chemically equivalent. (Signal 3)\n4.  The para-proton (at C4) is unique. (Signal 4)\n\nTherefore, phenol has **4** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms. This matches one of the answer choices.\n\nThis pathway, while involving a complex final step, is the most logical route that connects the starting materials and reaction conditions to one of the provided answers. The elaborate structure of the diene precursor seems designed to ensure that the adduct formed in step 1 will readily undergo the retro-Diels-Alder in step 4 to generate the key intermediate, 7-norbornadienone.\n\n<<<C>>>"
