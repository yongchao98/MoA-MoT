    "Answering the user's question requires us to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Formula for Equilibrium Temperature:**\n    The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet in a circular orbit around its star is given by:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n    where:\n    *   $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n    *   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n    *   $A$ is the planet's Bond albedo.\n\n2.  **Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures:**\n    We need to find the ratio $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}}$.\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\n    The problem states that the planets orbit the same star, so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same for both. It is also given that both planets have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). We can cancel these common terms from the equation:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_2} \\right)^{1/2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}$\n\n    To find the temperature ratio, we first need to find the ratio of their semi-major axes, $\\frac{a_2}{a_1}$.\n\n3.  **Relating Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity:**\n    The problem provides the maximum Doppler shifts ($\\Delta\\lambda$) caused by each planet. The Doppler shift is related to the star's maximum radial velocity ($K$) by the formula:\n    $K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max}}{\\lambda_0}$\n    where $c$ is the speed of light and $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\n    The ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes is:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\lambda_0}}{c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\lambda_0}} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity amplitude ($K$) is related to the planet's mass ($M_p$), the star's mass ($M_{star}$), and the semi-major axis ($a$). Assuming the orbital inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ (a reasonable assumption since transits are observed), the relationship is:\n    $K = \\frac{M_p}{M_{star}} v_p$\n    where $v_p$ is the orbital velocity of the planet, given by $v_p = \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_{star}}{a}}$.\n\n    Substituting $v_p$ into the equation for $K$:\n    $K = \\frac{M_p}{M_{star}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_{star}}{a}} = M_p \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{M_{star} \\cdot a}}$\n\n4.  **Deriving the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:**\n    Let's rearrange the formula to solve for the semi-major axis, $a$:\n    $K^2 = M_p^2 \\frac{G}{M_{star} \\cdot a}$\n    $a = \\frac{G \\cdot M_p^2}{M_{star} \\cdot K^2}$\n\n    Now we can find the ratio $\\frac{a_2}{a_1}$:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{\\frac{G \\cdot M_{p2}^2}{M_{star} \\cdot K_2^2}}{\\frac{G \\cdot M_{p1}^2}{M_{star} \\cdot K_1^2}}$\n\n    The terms for the gravitational constant ($G$) and the star's mass ($M_{star}$) cancel out:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2}{M_{p1}^2} \\cdot \\frac{K_1^2}{K_2^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n    Substitute $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)^2$\n\n5.  **Calculation:**\n    Let's plug in the given values:\n    *   $M_{p1} = 7 \\, M_{Earth}$\n    *   $M_{p2} = 5 \\, M_{Earth}$\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03 \\, \\AA$\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04 \\, \\AA$\n\n    $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n    $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n    Now, calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\cdot \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\n    Finally, calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{225}}{\\sqrt{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n    To get the final numerical value, we compute the division.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Masses of the planets\nM_p1 = 7  # in Earth masses\nM_p2 = 5  # in Earth masses\n\n# Doppler shifts\ndelta_lambda_1 = 0.03  # in Angstroms\ndelta_lambda_2 = 0.04  # in Angstroms\n\n# Ratio of masses\nmass_ratio = M_p2 / M_p1\n\n# Ratio of Doppler shifts\nshift_ratio = delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2\n\n# Ratio of semi-major axes (a2/a1)\n# a2/a1 = (Mp2/Mp1)^2 * (K1/K2)^2 = (Mp2/Mp1)^2 * (d_lambda1/d_lambda2)^2\na_ratio = (mass_ratio**2) * (shift_ratio**2)\n\n# Ratio of equilibrium temperatures (Teq1/Teq2)\n# Teq1/Teq2 = sqrt(a2/a1)\ntemp_ratio = math.sqrt(a_ratio)\n\nprint(temp_ratio)\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Answering the user's question requires us to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main goal is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, which is $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}}$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet orbiting its star is given by:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n    *   $T_{star}$ = Star's effective temperature\n    *   $R_{star}$ = Star's radius\n    *   $a$ = Planet's semi-major axis (orbital distance)\n    *   $A$ = Planet's albedo (reflectivity)\n\n3.  **Form the Ratio of Temperatures:** We can set up the ratio for the two planets:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:**\n    *   The planets orbit the same star, so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same for both and can be canceled.\n    *   The problem states that both planets have the same albedo, so $A_1 = A_2$. The term $(1 - A)^{1/4}$ can also be canceled.\n    *   The remaining simplified ratio is:\n        $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_2} \\right)^{1/2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}$\n    *   To find the temperature ratio, we need to find the ratio of their orbital distances, $\\frac{a_2}{a_1}$.\n\n5.  **Relate Orbital Distance to Provided Data:** The problem gives the maximum Doppler shifts ($\\Delta\\lambda$) caused by the planets' gravitational pull on the star. This is related to the star's maximum radial velocity amplitude, $K$.\n    *   The formula for the star's radial velocity amplitude $K$ is:\n        $K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max}}{\\lambda_0}$\n        where $c$ is the speed of light and $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength.\n    *   The ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes is directly proportional to the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\n        $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n\n6.  **Connect Radial Velocity Amplitude to Orbital Parameters:** For a planet in a circular orbit viewed edge-on (which is a good approximation since transits are observed), the star's radial velocity amplitude $K$ is given by:\n    $K = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{P} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{M_p}{(M_{star} + M_p)^{2/3}}$\n    However, a simpler form relates $K$ directly to the semi-major axis $a$:\n    From Kepler's third law, the orbital period $P = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{a^3}{G(M_{star}+M_p)}}$.\n    A more direct relationship, especially for $M_p << M_{star}$, is:\n    $K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_{star}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_{star}}{a}} = M_p \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{M_{star} \\cdot a}}$\n\n7.  **Derive the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes ($a_2/a_1$):**\n    *   Rearrange the formula to solve for $a$:\n        $K^2 = M_p^2 \\frac{G}{M_{star} \\cdot a} \\implies a = \\frac{G \\cdot M_p^2}{M_{star} \\cdot K^2}$\n    *   Now, create the ratio $\\frac{a_2}{a_1}$:\n        $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{\\frac{G \\cdot M_{p2}^2}{M_{star} \\cdot K_2^2}}{\\frac{G \\cdot M_{p1}^2}{M_{star} \\cdot K_1^2}}$\n    *   The gravitational constant $G$ and the star's mass $M_{star}$ cancel out:\n        $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2}{M_{p1}^2} \\cdot \\frac{K_1^2}{K_2^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n    *   Substitute $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$:\n        $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)^2$\n\n8.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   Given values:\n        *   $M_{p1} = 7 \\, M_{Earth}$\n        *   $M_{p2} = 5 \\, M_{Earth}$\n        *   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03 \\, \\AA$\n        *   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04 \\, \\AA$\n    *   Calculate the ratios:\n        *   $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n        *   $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n    *   Calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n        $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\cdot \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n    *   Finally, calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\n        $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{225}}{\\sqrt{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n    *   Compute the numerical value: $\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\n9.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated value of ~0.536 is closest to option D. The additional information about the star's mass, radius, temperature, and the planets' radii are distractors not needed for the ratio calculation.\n\nThe calculation was also verified with a python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Masses of the planets in Earth masses\nM_p1 = 7\nM_p2 = 5\n\n# Maximum Doppler shifts in Angstroms\ndelta_lambda_1 = 0.03\ndelta_lambda_2 = 0.04\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures (Teq1/Teq2) is equal to sqrt(a2/a1).\n# The ratio of semi-major axes (a2/a1) is equal to (Mp2/Mp1)^2 * (K1/K2)^2.\n# The ratio of radial velocity amplitudes (K1/K2) is equal to (delta_lambda_1/delta_lambda_2).\n\n# Therefore, Teq1/Teq2 = sqrt( (Mp2/Mp1)^2 * (delta_lambda_1/delta_lambda_2)^2 )\n# This simplifies to: Teq1/Teq2 = (Mp2/Mp1) * (delta_lambda_1/delta_lambda_2)\n\nmass_ratio = M_p2 / M_p1\nshift_ratio = delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2\n\ntemp_ratio = mass_ratio * shift_ratio\n\n# Alternatively, using the derived formulas step-by-step\n# a_ratio = (mass_ratio**2) * (shift_ratio**2)\n# temp_ratio_full = math.sqrt(a_ratio)\n# print(temp_ratio_full)\n\nprint(temp_ratio)\n```\nLet's re-check the final step of my reasoning.\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\nand\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)^2$\nSo, $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)^2} = \\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} \\cdot \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n\nLet's compute with this simplified formula:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\frac{5}{7} \\cdot \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThe calculation is correct.\n\nFinal Answer Comparison:\nCalculated Value: ~0.536\nOption D: ~0.53\nThe result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
