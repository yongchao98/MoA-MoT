    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n1.  **Identify the Parent Structure and Principal Functional Group:**\n    The molecule is a substituted benzene ring. It contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which has the highest priority among the given functional groups according to IUPAC nomenclature rules. Therefore, the parent structure is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is assigned the locant **1**.\n\n2.  **Place the Substituents based on the description:**\n    Let's denote the positions on the benzene ring from 1 to 6, starting with the carboxylic acid group at C1.\n\n    *   \"A carboxylic acid (at C1), a carbaldehyde (-CHO), and a cyano group (-CN) all meta to one another.\"\n        *   The 'meta' positions relative to C1 are C3 and C5. For all three groups to be mutually meta, they must be arranged in a 1,3,5 pattern.\n        *   So, the **carbaldehyde (-CHO, or formyl)** and **cyano (-CN)** groups are at positions **C3 and C5**.\n\n    *   \"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2).\"\n        *   The 'ortho' positions relative to C1 are C2 and C6.\n        *   So, the **hydroxyl (-OH)** and **dimethylamino** groups are at positions **C2 and C6**.\n\n    *   \"Para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group (-OCH3).\"\n        *   The 'para' position relative to C1 is C4.\n        *   So, the **methoxy (-OCH3)** group is at position **C4**.\n\n    At this point, the ring is fully substituted, but we have pairs of substituents in undecided positions: {-OH, -N(CH3)2} at {C2, C6} and {-CHO, -CN} at {C3, C5}.\n\n3.  **Use the Final Constraint to Determine the Exact Positions:**\n    *   \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n        *   The methoxy group is fixed at **C4**. For the nitrile (-CN) to be ortho to it, the nitrile must be at C3 or C5. This is consistent with our previous deduction.\n        *   The alcohol (hydroxyl group, -OH) must also be ortho to the nitrile. This is the key to solving the puzzle. Let's test the two possible positions for the nitrile:\n            *   **Scenario 1: If the nitrile (-CN) is at C3.** The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4. Since C4 is already occupied by the methoxy group, the alcohol **(-OH) must be at C2**.\n            *   **Scenario 2: If the nitrile (-CN) is at C5.** The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6. Since C4 is occupied by the methoxy group, the alcohol **(-OH) must be at C6**.\n\n4.  **Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules to Choose Between the Scenarios:**\n    The primary IUPAC rule for numbering a ring is to assign the lowest possible locants to the substituents. In this case, the substituent locants are fixed at {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, regardless of the scenario. When the locant set is identical, we use a tie-breaker: we number the ring to give the lowest possible locant to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\n    *   Let's list the substituent prefixes in alphabetical order:\n        *   **c**yano\n        *   **d**imethylamino\n        *   **f**ormyl\n        *   **h**ydroxy\n        *   **m**ethoxy\n\n    *   The rule requires that 'cyano' gets the lowest possible locant. The available positions for the cyano group are C3 and C5. To minimize its locant, the **cyano group must be placed at C3**.\n\n5.  **Finalize the Structure:**\n    *   Since the cyano group is at C3, we must follow **Scenario 1** from step 3.\n    *   From Scenario 1, the alcohol (-OH) must be at C2.\n    *   This forces the remaining substituents into their unique positions:\n        *   The dimethylamino group must be at C6 (the other ortho position).\n        *   The formyl group must be at C5 (the other meta position).\n\n    The definitive structure is:\n    *   C1: -COOH (Carboxylic acid)\n    *   C2: -OH (Hydroxy)\n    *   C3: -CN (Cyano)\n    *   C4: -OCH3 (Methoxy)\n    *   C5: -CHO (Formyl)\n    *   C6: -N(CH3)2 (Dimethylamino)\n\n6.  **Assemble the IUPAC Name:**\n    Now, write the full name by listing the substituent prefixes (with their determined locants) in alphabetical order, followed by the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n\n    *   **3-cyano-**\n    *   **6-(dimethylamino)-** (parentheses are used for complex substituents)\n    *   **5-formyl-**\n    *   **2-hydroxy-**\n    *   **4-methoxy**\n    *   **benzoic acid**\n\n    Combining these gives the final name:\n    **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid (Incorrect, substituents are not alphabetized)\n    *   B) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid (Incorrect, uses the wrong numbering)\n    *   C) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (**Correct**)\n    *   D) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid (Incorrect, uses the wrong numbering)\n\n<<<C>>>"
