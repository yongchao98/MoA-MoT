    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Two Mean Free Paths:**\n    *   **λ1:** This is the mean free path of the gas molecules themselves. It is determined by the rate of collisions between gas molecules.\n    *   **λ2:** This is the mean free path of the electrons from the beam as they travel through the residual gas. It is determined by the rate of scattering events between electrons and gas molecules.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Mean Free Path Equations:**\n    The general formula for mean free path (λ) is `λ = 1 / (n * σ)`, where `n` is the number density of target particles and `σ` is the collision cross-section. However, a correction factor is needed when the target particles are also in motion.\n\n    *   **For λ1 (gas-gas collisions):** The gas molecules are all moving at thermal velocities. To account for their relative motion, a factor of `sqrt(2)` is introduced into the denominator.\n        `λ1 = 1 / (sqrt(2) * n * σ_gg)`\n        where:\n        *   `n` = number density of gas molecules.\n        *   `σ_gg` = the collision cross-section for a gas molecule hitting another gas molecule (gas-kinetic cross-section).\n\n    *   **For λ2 (electron-gas collisions):** The electrons are accelerated to 1000 keV, making them travel at relativistic speeds (close to the speed of light). This velocity is orders of magnitude greater than the thermal velocity of the residual gas molecules. Therefore, the gas molecules can be considered effectively stationary targets. The `sqrt(2)` factor is not needed.\n        `λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)`\n        where:\n        *   `n` = number density of gas molecules (this is the same as for λ1).\n        *   `σ_eg` = the scattering cross-section for an electron hitting a gas molecule.\n\n3.  **Compare the Two Mean Free Paths:**\n    Let's find the ratio of λ2 to λ1:\n    `λ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (sqrt(2) * n * σ_gg)]`\n    `λ2 / λ1 = (sqrt(2) * σ_gg) / σ_eg`\n\n4.  **Analyze the Collision Cross-Sections (σ):**\n    *   `σ_gg`: This is the standard gas-kinetic cross-section. It's related to the physical size of the molecules, often modeled as `πd²` where `d` is the molecular diameter.\n    *   `σ_eg`: This is the cross-section for a high-energy electron scattering off a molecule. A high-energy (1000 keV) electron is a point-like particle with a very short de Broglie wavelength. It interacts with the electromagnetic field of the atom's nucleus and its electron cloud. At such high energies, the electron is more likely to pass through the atomic structure with only a small deflection rather than having a hard \"collision\". The quantum mechanical scattering cross-section (`σ_eg`) for such high-energy particles is generally *smaller* than the simple geometric/kinetic cross-section (`σ_gg`).\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Ratio λ2 / λ1:**\n    We have `λ2 / λ1 = (sqrt(2) * σ_gg) / σ_eg`.\n    *   `sqrt(2)` is approximately 1.414.\n    *   Since `σ_eg` is smaller than `σ_gg`, the ratio `σ_gg / σ_eg` is a value greater than 1.\n    *   Therefore, the total ratio `λ2 / λ1` must be greater than `sqrt(2) * 1`, which means `λ2 / λ1 > 1.414`.\n\n6.  **Draw the Final Conclusion:**\n    Our analysis shows that λ2 must be significantly larger than λ1. Specifically, `λ2 > 1.414 * λ1`. Now we check this against the given options:\n\n    *   A) λ2 < λ1 (Incorrect)\n    *   B) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 (Incorrect, our calculated lower bound is ~1.414)\n    *   C) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 (Correct. If `λ2 > 1.414 * λ1`, then it is certainly also `>= 1.22 * λ1`)\n    *   D) λ2 = λ1 (Incorrect)\n\n    The primary reasons for λ2 being larger than λ1 are:\n    1.  The absence of the `sqrt(2)` factor in the λ2 equation (because the electrons are much faster than the gas molecules).\n    2.  The smaller scattering cross-section of a high-energy electron compared to the kinetic cross-section of a gas molecule.\n\nBoth effects increase the mean free path for the electrons compared to that of the gas molecules. Option C is the only one that reflects this physical reality.\n\n<<<C>>>"
