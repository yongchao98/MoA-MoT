    "This is a problem of special relativity. We need to calculate the distance traveled by the supernova ejecta as measured from the reference frame of the Galaxy. To do this, we need to account for time dilation.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the reference frames:**\n    *   The Galaxy's reference frame (S). This is the stationary frame in our problem.\n    *   The ejecta's reference frame (S'). This is the moving frame.\n\n2.  **Identify the given quantities:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time elapsed in the moving frame (the ejecta's frame), `Δt' = 50 s`. This is the *proper time* (`Δt₀`) because it's measured in the frame of the event (the clock is on the ejecta).\n    *   The speed of light, `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n3.  **Determine the goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance `d` traveled by the ejecta as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (S). The formula for distance is `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (S).\n\n4.  **Apply the time dilation formula:**\n    *   An event that takes `Δt'` time in a moving frame (S') will be observed to take a longer time `Δt` in the stationary frame (S). This phenomenon is called time dilation.\n    *   The formula is `Δt = γ * Δt'`, where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is calculated as `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):**\n    *   First, find the ratio `v/c`:\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Next, square this ratio:\n        `(v/c)² = (0.2)² = 0.04`\n    *   Now, calculate `γ`:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the dilated time (Δt):**\n    *   `Δt = γ * Δt' = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n7.  **Calculate the distance (d) in the Galaxy's frame:**\n    *   `d = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * ( (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s )`\n    *   `d = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n    *   `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\nTo get the final numerical value, we'll perform the calculation using a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the given values\nv = 60000  # velocity of ejecta in km/s\ndt_prime = 50  # proper time in the ejecta's frame in seconds\nc = 300000 # speed of light in km/s\n\n# Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (time dilation)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - (v/c)**2)\ndt = gamma * dt_prime\n\n# Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame\ndistance = v * dt\n\nprint(f\"{distance:.0f}\")\n```\n>>>\n3061862\n<<<\n\nThe calculated distance is 3,061,862 km. This value is closest to option B.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy reference frame is approximately 3,060,000 km.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem requires the application of the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\nHere's the reasoning process:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   The \"Galaxy reference frame\" (let's call it S) is considered the stationary frame.\n    *   The \"ejecta reference frame\" (let's call it S') is the moving frame.\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time that has passed in the moving frame (ejecta's frame) is `Δt' = 50 s`. This is the *proper time* because it's the time measured by a clock that is moving with the ejecta.\n    *   The speed of light is `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance (`d`) the ejecta travels as measured in the stationary frame (the Galaxy's frame).\n    *   The formula for this distance is `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed as measured in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n4.  **Apply Time Dilation:**\n    *   An event that takes `Δt'` in a moving frame will appear to take a longer time `Δt` when measured from a stationary frame. This effect is known as time dilation.\n    *   The relationship is given by the formula: `Δt = γ * Δt'`, where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is calculated as `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n5.  **Step-by-Step Calculation:**\n\n    *   **Step A: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n        *   First, find the ratio `v/c`:\n            `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n        *   Next, square this value:\n            `(v/c)² = (0.2)² = 0.04`\n        *   Now, calculate `γ`:\n            `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n            `γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 = 1.02062`\n\n    *   **Step B: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt).**\n        *   `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n        *   `Δt ≈ 1.02062 * 50 s`\n        *   `Δt ≈ 51.031 s`\n\n    *   **Step C: Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame (d).**\n        *   `d = v * Δt`\n        *   `d ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.031 s`\n        *   `d ≈ 3,061,860 km`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   The calculated distance is approximately 3,061,860 km. This is extremely close to option B.\n\n    ```python\n    import math\n\n    # Define the constants from the problem\n    v = 60000  # Velocity of the ejecta in km/s\n    dt_prime = 50  # Time elapsed in the ejecta's frame in seconds\n    c = 300000  # Speed of light in km/s\n    \n    # Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\n    gamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - (v / c)**2)\n    \n    # Step 2: Calculate the dilated time (time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame)\n    dt_galaxy = gamma * dt_prime\n    \n    # Step 3: Calculate the distance traveled as measured in the Galaxy's frame\n    distance_in_galaxy_frame = v * dt_galaxy\n    \n    print(f\"The Lorentz factor (gamma) is: {gamma}\")\n    print(f\"The time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame is: {dt_galaxy} s\")\n    print(f\"The distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame is: {distance_in_galaxy_frame:.0f} km\")\n    \n    ```\n    \nThe calculation confirms that the distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's reference frame is approximately 3,061,862 km, which rounds nicely to 3,060,000 km.\n\n<<<B>>>"
