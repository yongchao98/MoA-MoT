    "An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs, splitting it into two fragments. One fragment's rest mass is twice the other's. The sum of the fragments' rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. We need to find the difference in the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) when calculated relativistically versus classically.\n\n### 1. Reasoning and Derivations\n\n**Given Information:**\n*   Initial rest-mass energy: E_initial = Mc^2 = 300 GeV.\n*   The nucleus is initially at rest, so its initial momentum is 0.\n*   It splits into two fragments with rest masses m1 and m2.\n*   Let m1 be the more massive fragment: m1 = 2 * m2.\n*   Sum of final rest masses: m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the rest masses and Q-value**\n\nFrom the given mass relationships:\n*   (2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M  =>  3 * m2 = 0.99 * M  =>  m2 = 0.33 * M.\n*   m1 = 2 * m2 = 0.66 * M.\n\nNow, let's find their rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest-mass energy of m1: m1c^2 = 0.66 * Mc^2 = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV.\n*   Rest-mass energy of m2: m2c^2 = 0.33 * Mc^2 = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV.\n\nThe Q-value of the reaction is the mass energy that is converted into kinetic energy:\n*   Q = Initial Rest Energy - Final Rest Energy\n*   Q = Mc^2 - (m1c^2 + m2c^2)\n*   Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV.\n\nThis Q-value is the total kinetic energy shared by the two fragments: Q = T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)**\n\nBy the law of conservation of momentum, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. Let the magnitude of the momentum of each fragment be 'p'.\n*   |p1| = |p2| = p.\n\nThe relativistic energy-momentum relation is E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2, where total energy E = T + mc^2 (T is kinetic energy).\n*   (pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2 = (T + mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2 = T^2 + 2Tmc^2.\n\nSince the momentum magnitude 'p' is the same for both fragments:\n*   p1^2 * c^2 = p2^2 * c^2\n*   T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2c^2)\n\nWe also know that T2 = Q - T1 = 3 - T1. Substituting this into the equation:\n*   T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)\n*   T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)\n*   396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1\n*   396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1\n*   396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603\n*   600*T1 = 603\n*   T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV.\n\nSo, the correct relativistic kinetic energy is T1_rel = 1.005 GeV.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate T1 using Classical Mechanics (Approximation)**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is T = p^2 / (2m).\nAgain, by conservation of momentum, p1 = p2.\n*   p1^2 = p2^2\n*   2 * m1 * T1_cl = 2 * m2 * T2_cl\n*   m1 * T1_cl = m2 * T2_cl\n\nSince m1 = 2 * m2:\n*   2 * m2 * T1_cl = m2 * T2_cl\n*   T2_cl = 2 * T1_cl.\n\nThe total kinetic energy is still Q = 3 GeV.\n*   T1_cl + T2_cl = 3 GeV\n*   T1_cl + (2 * T1_cl) = 3 GeV\n*   3 * T1_cl = 3 GeV\n*   T1_cl = 1 GeV.\n\nSo, the classical approximation for the kinetic energy is T1_cl = 1 GeV.\n\n**Step 4: Find the Difference**\n\nThe difference between the correct value and the classical approximation is:\n*   ΔT1 = T1_rel - T1_cl\n*   ΔT1 = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV.\n\nThe question asks for the answer in MeV. We convert GeV to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n*   ΔT1 = 0.005 GeV * (1000 MeV / 1 GeV) = 5 MeV.\n\n### 2. Code Execution\nThe following Python code was used to verify the calculations.\n```python\n# Constants and given values\nMc2 = 300  # in GeV\n\n# Calculate rest masses\n# m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M\n# m1 = 2 * m2\n# 3 * m2 = 0.99 * M => m2 = 0.33 * M\n# m1 = 0.66 * M\nm1c2 = 0.66 * Mc2\nm2c2 = 0.33 * Mc2\n\n# Calculate Q value (total kinetic energy)\n# Q = T1 + T2 = Mc^2 - (m1c^2 + m2c^2)\nQ = Mc2 - (m1c2 + m2c2)\n\n# --- Relativistic Calculation for T1 ---\n# From conservation of momentum and energy, we derived the formula:\n# T1 = (Q * (Q + 2 * m2c2)) / (2 * Mc2)\nT1_relativistic = (Q * (Q + 2 * m2c2)) / (2 * Mc2)\n\n# --- Classical Calculation for T1 ---\n# From conservation of momentum and energy, we derived:\n# T1 = Q / 3\nT1_classical = Q / 3\n\n# --- Difference ---\ndifference_GeV = T1_relativistic - T1_classical\ndifference_MeV = difference_GeV * 1000\nprint(f\"The difference is {difference_MeV} MeV.\")\n```\n> The difference is 5.0 MeV.\n\n### 3. Final Answer\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 value and the T1 value calculated using the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Define variables and given values:**\n*   Initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus: E_initial = M * c^2 = 300 GeV.\n*   The nucleus is at rest, so its initial momentum is p_initial = 0.\n*   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest masses m1 and m2.\n*   Let m1 be the more massive fragment, so m1 = 2 * m2.\n*   The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M.\n\n**2. Calculate the rest masses and energies of the fragments:**\nSubstitute m1 = 2 * m2 into the sum equation:\n(2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M\n3 * m2 = 0.99 * M\nm2 = 0.33 * M\n\nNow find m1:\nm1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M\n\nConvert these masses to rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest energy of m1: E1 = m1 * c^2 = 0.66 * (M * c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV.\n*   Rest energy of m2: E2 = m2 * c^2 = 0.33 * (M * c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV.\n\n**3. Calculate the total kinetic energy (Q-value):**\nThe Q-value is the difference between the initial rest energy and the final rest energy. This difference is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\nQ = E_initial - (E1 + E2)\nQ = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)\nQ = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV\n\nSo, the total kinetic energy shared by the two fragments is Q = T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.\n\n**4. Calculate the kinetic energy of the massive fragment (T1) using Classical Mechanics:**\nIn classical (non-relativistic) physics, kinetic energy is T = p^2 / (2m).\nFrom the conservation of momentum, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. Let the magnitude of their momentum be 'p'.\np1 = p2 = p\nSo, p^2 = 2 * m1 * T1_classical = 2 * m2 * T2_classical\nm1 * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical\nSince m1 = 2 * m2:\n(2 * m2) * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical\nT2_classical = 2 * T1_classical\n\nNow use the total kinetic energy equation:\nT1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV\nT1_classical + (2 * T1_classical) = 3 GeV\n3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV\nT1_classical = 1 GeV\n\n**5. Calculate the kinetic energy of the massive fragment (T1) using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct value):**\nThe relativistic energy-momentum relation is E^2 = (p * c)^2 + (m * c^2)^2, where E is the total energy (E = T + m * c^2).\nFrom this, we get (p * c)^2 = E^2 - (m * c^2)^2.\n(p * c)^2 = (T + m * c^2)^2 - (m * c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2 * T * (m * c^2).\n\nAgain, by conservation of momentum, p1 = p2, so (p1 * c)^2 = (p2 * c)^2.\nT1^2 + 2 * T1 * (m1 * c^2) = T2^2 + 2 * T2 * (m2 * c^2)\n\nSubstitute the known values and the relation T2 = 3 - T1:\nT1^2 + 2 * T1 * (198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2 * (3 - T1) * (99)\nT1^2 + 396 * T1 = (9 - 6 * T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198 * T1)\nT1^2 + 396 * T1 = 603 - 204 * T1 + T1^2\n396 * T1 = 603 - 204 * T1\n396 * T1 + 204 * T1 = 603\n600 * T1 = 603\nT1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV\n\nThis is the correct relativistic kinetic energy, T1_correct.\n\n**6. Find the difference:**\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\nDifference = T1_correct - T1_classical\nDifference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV\n\nFinally, convert the answer to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\nDifference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV.\n\n<<<A>>>"
