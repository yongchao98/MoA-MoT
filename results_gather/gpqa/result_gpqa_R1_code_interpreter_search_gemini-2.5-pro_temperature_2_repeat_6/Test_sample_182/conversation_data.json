    "**1. Analyze the Reactant**\n\nFirst, let's determine the structure and molecular formula of the reactant, 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: This is a six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbon-3 and carbon-4.\n*   **carboxylic acid**: A -COOH group is attached to the ring. By convention, this is at position C1.\n*   **2-formyl**: A formyl group (-CHO) is attached at position C2.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A vinyl group (-CH=CH2) is attached at position C5.\n\nLet's determine the molecular formula by counting the atoms:\n*   **Carbon (C)**:\n    *   6 carbons in the cyclohexene ring.\n    *   1 carbon in the carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   1 carbon in the formyl group (-CHO).\n    *   2 carbons in the vinyl group (-CH=CH2).\n    *   Total Carbon atoms = 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10.\n*   **Hydrogen (H)**:\n    *   H on C1: 1\n    *   H on C2: 1\n    *   H on C3: 1\n    *   H on C4: 1\n    *   H on C5: 1\n    *   H on C6: 2\n    *   H in -COOH: 1\n    *   H in -CHO: 1\n    *   H in -CH=CH2: 3\n    *   Total Hydrogen atoms = (1+1+1+1+1+2) + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12.\n*   **Oxygen (O)**:\n    *   2 oxygens in the carboxylic acid group.\n    *   1 oxygen in the formyl group.\n    *   Total Oxygen atoms = 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nSo, the molecular formula of the reactant is **C10H12O3**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\nThe reagent used is **Red Phosphorus with excess HI (Hydroiodic acid)**. This is a very powerful reducing agent combination known for its ability to carry out complete reduction. It reduces most oxygen-containing functional groups and unsaturations (double/triple bonds) to their corresponding saturated alkane form.\n\nHere's how it will affect the reactant:\n*   The **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)** at C1 will be reduced to a **methyl group (-CH3)**.\n*   The **formyl group (-CHO)** at C2 will be reduced to a **methyl group (-CH3)**.\n*   The **double bond in the cyclohexene ring (C3=C4)** will be reduced to a **single bond (C3-C4)**, making the ring a cyclohexane.\n*   The **vinyl group (-CH=CH2)** at C5 will be reduced to an **ethyl group (-CH2-CH3)**.\n\n**3. Determine the Product**\n\nBased on the reductions above, the carbon skeleton remains the same (a six-membered ring with substituents), but all functional groups and double bonds are saturated.\nThe product will be **1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane**.\n\nNow, let's find the molecular formula of the product:\n*   **Carbon (C)**: The number of carbon atoms does not change during this reduction. So, C = 10.\n*   **Hydrogen (H)**: The product is a substituted cycloalkane. A monocyclic alkane (a compound with one ring and no double or triple bonds) has the general formula **CnH2n**.\n    *   Since n = 10, the number of hydrogen atoms will be 2 * 10 = 20.\n*   **Oxygen (O)**: All oxygen atoms are removed during the reduction. So, O = 0.\n\nThe molecular formula of the product is **C10H20**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), or degree of unsaturation, tells us the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule. The formula is:\nIHD = C - (H/2) + 1 (for molecules with C, H, and O)\n\nUsing the molecular formula of the product (C10H20):\nIHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1\nIHD = 10 - 10 + 1\nIHD = 1\n\nAlternatively, we can determine the IHD by examining the structure of the product, 1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane.\n*   Number of rings = 1 (the cyclohexane ring)\n*   Number of double bonds = 0\n*   Number of triple bonds = 0\n\nIHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nBoth methods confirm that the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1."
