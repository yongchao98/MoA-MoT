    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reagents.\n\n**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction involves the conversion of a ketone (butan-2-one) into a cyanohydrin (2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile). The key functional group transformation is C=O to C(OH)(CN). This is a nucleophilic addition reaction to a carbonyl group.\n\n2.  **Analyze the mechanism:**\n    *   Sodium cyanide (NaCN) is an ionic salt that dissociates in solution to provide the cyanide ion (CN⁻). The cyanide ion is a potent nucleophile.\n    *   The carbon atom of the carbonyl group in butan-2-one is electrophilic due to the electronegativity of the oxygen atom.\n    *   The nucleophilic CN⁻ attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon, breaking the C=O pi bond and forming a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate.\n        *   CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂CH₃ + CN⁻ → CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂CH₃\n    *   This alkoxide intermediate needs to be protonated to form the final hydroxyl (-OH) group of the cyanohydrin product.\n        *   CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂CH₃ + H⁺ → CH₃-C(OH)(CN)-CH₂CH₃ (which is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile).\n    *   Reagent A must be the source of this proton (H⁺).\n\n3.  **Evaluate the options for A:**\n    *   **H₃O⁺:** This represents a hydronium ion, which is characteristic of an acidic solution or an acidic workup step. It is an excellent source of protons and is commonly used to complete cyanohydrin formation.\n    *   **NaHSO₃:** Sodium bisulfite reacts with ketones to form bisulfite addition products (e.g., CH₃-C(OH)(SO₃Na)-CH₂CH₃). This is a different reaction and does not lead to the formation of a cyanohydrin.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** Reagent A must be H₃O⁺. This eliminates options B and D.\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This transformation is called nitrile hydrolysis. The rest of the molecule remains unchanged.\n\n2.  **Analyze the mechanism:**\n    *   The hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid requires water and a catalyst. The reaction can be catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base.\n    *   **Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis:** The nitrile is reacted with water under strong acidic conditions (e.g., aqueous HCl or H₂SO₄), typically with heating. The overall reaction is: R-CN + 2 H₂O + H⁺ → R-COOH + NH₄⁺.\n    *   **Base-catalyzed hydrolysis:** The nitrile is reacted with a strong base (e.g., NaOH), followed by an acidic workup to protonate the resulting carboxylate salt.\n    *   The problem specifies that reagent B is used along with water (H₂O) to directly form the carboxylic acid product, which is typical for acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the options for B:**\n    *   **HCl (Hydrochloric acid):** This is a strong acid and is a standard, effective catalyst for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.\n    *   **CH₃COOH (Acetic acid):** This is a weak acid. While it can provide protons, it is generally not a strong enough catalyst to efficiently drive the hydrolysis of a stable nitrile group to completion.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** Reagent B must be a strong acid catalyst. HCl is the appropriate choice.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\n*   For the first reaction, A = H₃O⁺.\n*   For the second reaction, B = HCl.\n\nCombining these two conclusions, the correct pair of reagents is A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
