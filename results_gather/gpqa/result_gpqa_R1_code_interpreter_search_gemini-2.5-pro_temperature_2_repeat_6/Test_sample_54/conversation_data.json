    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown organic compound from the provided 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's break down each signal provided in the 1H NMR spectrum:\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This region is characteristic of protons on a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   **Integration (3H):** The signal represents three equivalent protons, consistent with a methyl (CH₃) group.\n    *   **Splitting (s):** A singlet indicates that this methyl group has no adjacent protons.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This signal corresponds to an acetyl group (CH₃C=O).\n\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This is in the allylic/vinylic region, suggesting a methyl group attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal also represents a methyl (CH₃) group.\n    *   **Splitting (d):** A doublet indicates this methyl group is coupled to a single adjacent proton.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a CH₃-CH= group.\n\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** This is in the alkene (vinylic) region for a proton directly on a double bond.\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal represents a single proton.\n    *   **Splitting (dq):** A doublet of quartets means this proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons: one single proton (causing the doublet splitting) and a group of three equivalent protons (causing the quartet splitting).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This proton is on the double bond and is adjacent to both another single proton on the double bond and the methyl group we identified at 1.6 ppm. This confirms the `CH₃-CH=` fragment from the previous signal.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This is also in the vinylic region, quite downfield, which suggests it is attached to an electronegative atom like oxygen (e.g., in an enol ether or enol ester).\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal represents a single proton.\n    *   **Splitting (d):** A doublet means this proton is coupled to one adjacent proton. This must be the proton at 5.5 ppm.\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This is a crucial piece of information. The magnitude of the coupling constant (J-value) between two protons across a double bond tells us about their stereochemical relationship. A large J-value (typically 12-18 Hz) is characteristic of a *trans* arrangement. A smaller J-value (typically 6-12 Hz) would indicate a *cis* arrangement.\n\n**2. Assemble the Structure**\n\nLet's put the pieces together:\n1.  We have an acetyl group: `CH₃-C(=O)-`.\n2.  We have a `CH₃-CH=` fragment.\n3.  We have a vinylic proton `=-CH-` that is coupled to the `CH₃-CH=` proton and is also deshielded, suggesting it's bonded to an oxygen.\n\nCombining these fragments gives the structure of propenyl acetate: `CH₃-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH₃`.\n\nLet's verify this structure against the data:\n*   `CH₃` (acetyl): Singlet, 3H -> Matches 2.1 ppm signal.\n*   `CH₃` (vinylic): Coupled to one proton (`=CH-`), so it's a doublet, 3H -> Matches 1.6 ppm signal.\n*   `=CH-` (next to methyl): Coupled to the other vinylic proton (doublet) and the vinylic methyl (quartet), so it's a doublet of quartets, 1H -> Matches 5.5 ppm signal.\n*   `=CH-O-`: Coupled to the other vinylic proton, so it's a doublet, 1H -> Matches 7.0 ppm signal.\n\nThe proposed structure of propenyl acetate perfectly fits the connectivity implied by the splitting patterns.\n\n**3. Eliminate Incorrect Options**\n\nThe options include \"butenyl acetate\".\n*   **Propenyl acetate (C₅H₈O₂):** The total number of protons is 3+1+1+3 = 8. This matches the integration values from the spectrum (3+3+1+1=8).\n*   **Butenyl acetate (C₆H₁₀O₂):** The total number of protons is 10. This does not match the integration from the spectrum.\nTherefore, we can eliminate options B (Cis-butenyl acetate) and D (Trans-butenyl acetate).\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry**\n\nWe are left with Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate. The decision is made based on the coupling constant of the vinylic protons.\n\n*   The signal at 7.0 ppm is a doublet with a coupling constant **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n*   As stated before, a J-value between 12-18 Hz is definitive for a **trans** configuration of protons on a double bond.\n*   If the compound were cis, the J-value would be in the 6-12 Hz range.\n\nThus, the unknown compound must have a trans double bond.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe compound has the structure of propenyl acetate and the vinylic protons are in a trans configuration. The correct identification is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
