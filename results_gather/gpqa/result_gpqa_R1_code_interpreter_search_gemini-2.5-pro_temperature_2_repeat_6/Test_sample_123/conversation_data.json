    "The problem asks for the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$) needed for a certain fraction of particles to survive a specific distance. This involves relativistic time dilation.\n\nHere's the reasoning process:\n\n1.  **Particle Decay Law:** The number of particles, N, that survive after a time 't' in the laboratory frame is given by the exponential decay formula:\n    $N(t) = N_0 e^{-t / \\tau_{lab}}$\n    where $N_0$ is the initial number of particles and $\\tau_{lab}$ is their mean lifetime as measured in the lab.\n\n2.  **Time Dilation:** The lifetime of a moving particle is dilated (extended) from the perspective of a stationary observer.

The time it takes for them to travel the detector radius, R = 30 m, is:\n    $t = R / v \\approx R / c$\n\n4.  **Combining the Formulas:** We can substitute the expressions for $\\tau_{lab}$ and $t$ into the decay law to find the fraction of surviving particles, $f = N/N_0$:\n    $f = e^{-(R/c) / (\\gamma \\tau_0)}$\n\n    The term $R/(c\\tau_0)$ depends on the detector radius, the speed of light, and the proper lifetime of the particle type. Since these are all constant for this experiment, let's group them into a single constant, $K = R/(c\\tau_0)$. The formula simplifies to:\n    $f = e^{-K/\\gamma}$\n\n5.  **Using the Initial Conditions:** We are given that for a Lorentz factor $\\gamma_1 = 20$, the fraction of surviving particles is $f_1 = 1/3$. We can use this to find the constant K.\n    $1/3 = e^{-K/20}$\n\n    To solve for K, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n    $\\ln(1/3) = -K/20$\n    $-\\ln(3) = -K/20$\n    $K = 20 \\ln(3)$\n\n6.  **Solving for the New Lorentz Factor:** We now want to find the new Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_2$, that results in a survival fraction of $f_2 = 2/3$. We use the same formula with the value of K we just found:\n    $2/3 = e^{-K/\\gamma_2}$\n\n    Again, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $\\ln(2/3) = -K/\\gamma_2$\n\n    Now, solve for $\\gamma_2$:\n    $\\gamma_2 = -K / \\ln(2/3)$\n\n    Substitute the expression for K:\n    $\\gamma_2 = - (20 \\ln(3)) / \\ln(2/3)$\n\n    Using the logarithm property $\\ln(a/b) = -\\ln(b/a)$, we get $\\ln(2/3) = -\\ln(3/2)$:\n    $\\gamma_2 = - (20 \\ln(3)) / (-\\ln(3/2)) = (20 \\ln(3)) / \\ln(3/2)$\n\n7.  **Calculation:** Now we just need to compute the numerical value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Use the derived formula to calculate the new Lorentz factor, gamma_2.\n# gamma_1 = 20\n# f_1 = 1/3\n# f_2 = 2/3\n# Formula: gamma_2 = gamma_1 * ln(f_1)/ln(f_2) = 20 * ln(1/3)/ln(2/3) = 20 * ln(3)/ln(1.5)\ngamma_2 = (20 * math.log(3)) / math.log(1.5)\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\n```output\n54.18835508827196\n```\nThe calculated value for the new Lorentz factor is approximately 54.19.

    "This problem is solved by applying the principles of special relativity to particle decay. Here's a detailed breakdown of the steps.\n\n**1. The Physics of Relativistic Particle Decay**\n\nThe fraction of particles ($f = N/N_0$) that survive after traveling a certain time ($t$) is given by the exponential decay law:\n$f = e^{-t / \\tau_{lab}}$\n\nHere, $\\tau_{lab}$ is the particle's mean lifetime as measured in the laboratory's frame of reference. Due to time dilation, this is related to the particle's proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$, its lifetime in its own rest frame) and its Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$) by the equation:\n$\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0$\n\nThe time of flight ($t$) for a particle traveling at a velocity $v$ across a distance $R$ is $t = R/v$. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their velocity $v$ is very close to the speed of light $c$, so we can approximate $t \\approx R/c$.\n\nSubstituting these into the decay equation, we get a relationship between the survival fraction and the Lorentz factor:\n$f = e^{-(R/c) / (\\gamma \\tau_0)}$\n\n**2. Formulating a Simpler Relationship**\n\nLet's group the constant terms. The detector radius $R$, the speed of light $c$, and the proper lifetime $\\tau_0$ are all constants for this scenario. We can define a single constant $A = \\frac{R}{c\\tau_0}$. This constant has units of time and represents the time of flight in units of proper lifetimes. The equation simplifies to:\n$f = e^{-A/\\gamma}$\n\nWe can solve this for $\\gamma$:\n$\\ln(f) = -A/\\gamma$\n$\\gamma = -A / \\ln(f)$\n\nThis tells us that the Lorentz factor is proportional to $-1/\\ln(f)$. We can use this to set up a ratio. For two different scenarios (1 and 2):\n$\\gamma_1 = -A / \\ln(f_1)$\n$\\gamma_2 = -A / \\ln(f_2)$\n\nDividing the second equation by the first gives:\n$\\frac{\\gamma_2}{\\gamma_1} = \\frac{-A / \\ln(f_2)}{-A / \\ln(f_1)} = \\frac{\\ln(f_1)}{\\ln(f_2)}$\n\nTherefore, we can find the new Lorentz factor $\\gamma_2$ without needing to calculate the constant A:\n$\\gamma_2 = \\gamma_1 \\frac{\\ln(f_1)}{\\ln(f_2)}$\n\n**3.

    "This is a problem about relativistic particle decay, where the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation, are crucial.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Fundamental Equations:**\n    *   **Particle Decay:** The number of particles, N, that survive after a time, t, is given by the exponential decay law: $N(t) = N_0 e^{-t/\\tau_{lab}}$, where $N_0$ is the initial number and $\\tau_{lab}$ is the mean lifetime in the lab frame.\n    *   **Time Dilation:** The lifetime of a moving particle is extended from the perspective of a stationary observer (the lab). This is described by $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor and $\\tau_0$ is the proper lifetime (the lifetime in the particle's own rest frame).\n    *   **Time of Flight:** The particles are ultra-relativistic, so their speed, v, is nearly the speed of light, c. The time to travel the detector radius, R, is $t = R/v \\approx R/c$.\n\n2.  **Combining the Physics:**\n    We can substitute the expressions for $\\tau_{lab}$ and $t$ into the decay law to get the fraction of surviving particles, $f = N(t)/N_0$:\n    $f = e^{-(R/c) / (\\gamma \\tau_0)}$\n\n3.  **Establishing a Relationship:**\n    The term $(R / (c \\tau_0))$ is a constant for this specific experiment because the detector size and the particle type are not changing. Let's call this constant `A`. The formula becomes:\n    $f = e^{-A/\\gamma}$\n\n    We can rearrange this formula by taking the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n    $\\ln(f) = -A/\\gamma$\n    $\\gamma \\cdot \\ln(f) = -A$\n\n    Since `-A` is a constant, the product $\\gamma \\cdot \\ln(f)$ must be constant for any set of conditions in this experiment.
