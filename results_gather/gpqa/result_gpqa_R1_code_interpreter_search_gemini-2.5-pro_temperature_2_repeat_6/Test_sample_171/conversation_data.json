    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical Principle:** The problem deals with the population of atomic energy levels in the photospheres of stars. The key assumption is \"Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium\" (LTE), which allows us to use the **Boltzmann equation**.\n\n2.  **Write down the Boltzmann Equation:** The Boltzmann equation describes the ratio of the number of atoms (N) in two different energy states, an upper state `j` and a lower state `i`, as a function of temperature (T).\n    \n    N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k_B * T))\n    \n    where:\n    *   `N_j / N_i` is the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state to the lower state. This represents the \"excitation\".\n    *   `g_j / g_i` is the ratio of the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the two energy levels. For the same transition in the same atom (iron), this ratio is a constant.\n    *   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the two levels.\n    *   `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.38 x 10^-23 J/K).\n    *   `T` is the effective temperature of the stellar photosphere.\n\n3.  **Apply the Boltzmann Equation to Each Star:**\n    *   For star_1 with temperature T_1, the excitation is:\n        `(N_j / N_i)_1 = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k_B * T_1))`\n    *   For star_2 with temperature T_2, the excitation is:\n        `(N_j / N_i)_2 = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k_B * T_2))`\n\n4.  **Use the Information Given in the Problem:** The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice the excitation in star_2. Mathematically, this is:\n    \n    `(N_j / N_i)_1 = 2 * (N_j / N_i)_2`\n\n5.  **Substitute the Boltzmann Equations into the Relationship:**\n    \n    `(g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k_B * T_1)) = 2 * [ (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k_B * T_2)) ]`\n\n6.  **Simplify the Equation:** The term `(g_j / g_i)` is present on both sides and can be canceled out.\n    \n    `exp(-ΔE / (k_B * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k_B * T_2))`\n\n7.  **Solve for the Temperatures:** To isolate the temperatures from the exponential function, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides.\n    \n    `ln[ exp(-ΔE / (k_B * T_1)) ] = ln[ 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k_B * T_2)) ]`\n    \n    Using the logarithm properties `ln(exp(x)) = x` and `ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)`:\n    \n    `-ΔE / (k_B * T_1) = ln(2) + ln[ exp(-ΔE / (k_B * T_2)) ]`\n    \n    `-ΔE / (k_B * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k_B * T_2)`\n\n8.  **Rearrange the Equation:** Group the terms with temperature on one side and `ln(2)` on the other.\n    \n    `(ΔE / (k_B * T_2)) - (ΔE / (k_B * T_1)) = ln(2)`\n    \n    Factor out the common term `(ΔE / k_B)`:\n    \n    `(ΔE / k_B) * [ (1 / T_2) - (1 / T_1) ] = ln(2)`\n    \n    Combine the fractions inside the brackets by finding a common denominator (`T1 * T2`):\n    \n    `(ΔE / k_B) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)`\n\n9.  **Incorporate the Specific Numerical Values:** The problem provides key numerical data:\n    *   Energy difference: `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10^-23 J`\n    *   Boltzmann constant: `k_B ≈ 1.38 x 10^-23 J/K`\n    \n    Let's calculate the factor `(ΔE / k_B)`:\n    \n    `ΔE / k_B = (1.38 x 10^-23 J) / (1.38 x 10^-23 J/K) = 1 K`\n    \n    The options provided in the question do not contain `ΔE` or `k_B`, which implies that this pre-factor `(ΔE / k_B)` must simplify to 1. The problem has been intentionally designed with values that make this happen.\n\n10. **Final Equation:** Substitute the value `(ΔE / k_B) = 1` into our derived equation:\n    \n    `1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)`\n    \n    This simplifies to:\n    \n    `ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n    \n    This equation matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
