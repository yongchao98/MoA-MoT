    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Structures**\n\n*   **Starting Material Options:** The options are stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid). It has a chiral center at carbon-3.\n    *   Let's draw the structure: `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu`\n    *   It contains two functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-COO-iBu).\n    *   The chiral center is the carbon with the ethyl group (`-CH(Et)-`). The reactions happen at the ends of the molecule, so the stereochemistry at this carbon is expected to be retained throughout the reaction sequence. However, the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) designation (R or S) may change if the relative priorities of the substituents change.\n\n*   **Product Structure:** The product is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. This is a six-membered lactone (a cyclic ester).\n    *   The lactone is formed from a `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`. The `-OH` group at C-5 reacts with the `-COOH` group at C-1 to form the six-membered ring.\n    *   The stereocenter in the product is at C-4, which corresponds to C-3 in the starting material.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reactions and Reagent Selectivity**\n\nBoth reactions involve a selective reduction of one of the two carbonyl groups, followed by an acid-catalyzed cyclization (lactonization).\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** Reagent is **LiBH₄** (Lithium borohydride).\n    *   `LiBH₄` is a reducing agent that is known to selectively reduce esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids (which react much more slowly).\n    *   So, `LiBH₄` will reduce the ester group (`-COO-iBu`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`), leaving the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) untouched.\n    *   The intermediate formed is `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂-OH` (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid).\n    *   The final H+ step catalyzes intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the product lactone.\n\n*   **Reaction 2:** Reagent is **BH₃** (Borane).\n    *   `BH₃` is known for its high selectivity in reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols in the presence of esters.\n    *   So, `BH₃` will reduce the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`), leaving the ester group (`-COO-iBu`) untouched.\n    *   The intermediate formed is `HO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu` (isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate).\n    *   The final H+ step catalyzes intramolecular transesterification, where the newly formed alcohol group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (`iBuOH`) and forming the lactone product.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Stereochemistry and CIP Priority Changes**\n\nThe key to this problem is understanding how the reactions affect the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the groups attached to the chiral center, which determines the R/S designation.\n\n1.  **Priorities in the Starting Material (SM):**\n    *   The chiral carbon (C3) is attached to: H, -CH₂CH₃ (Et), -CH₂COOH (Acid chain), and -CH₂COO-iBu (Ester chain).\n    *   By CIP rules, H is priority 4. Comparing the other three groups:\n        *   The ester chain (-CH₂COO-iBu) has higher priority than the acid chain (-CH₂COOH).\n        *   Both the ester and acid chains have higher priority than the ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   So, the priority order is: **P1: -CH₂COO-iBu > P2: -CH₂COOH > P3: -Et > P4: H**.\n\n2.  **Priorities in the Product (Lactone):**\n    *   The chiral carbon (C4) is attached to: H, -CH₂CH₃ (Et), the carbonyl side of the ring (-CH₂-C=O), and the ether side of the ring (-CH₂-CH₂-O-).\n    *   By CIP rules, the priority order is: **New P1: -CH₂-C=O > New P2: -CH₂-CH₂-O- > New P3: -Et > New P4: H**.\n\n3.  **Trace the Priority Changes for Each Reaction:**\n    *   **Reaction 1 (LiBH₄):**\n        *   The ester group (Original P1) is reduced and becomes the ether side of the lactone (New P2).\n        *   The acid group (Original P2) becomes the carbonyl side of the lactone (New P1).\n        *   The two highest priority groups have swapped their priority labels (Old P1 → New P2, Old P2 → New P1). A single swap of priorities inverts the stereochemical designation.\n        *   Therefore, an (S)-starting material will yield an (R)-product, and an (R)-starting material will yield an (S)-product.\n        *   The problem states that `(R)-lactone` is formed. Thus, starting material **A must be (S)**.\n\n    *   **Reaction 2 (BH₃):**\n        *   The acid group (Original P2) is reduced and becomes the ether side of the lactone (New P2).\n        *   The ester group (Original P1) becomes the carbonyl side of the lactone (New P1).\n        *   The priority labels are maintained (Old P1 → New P1, Old P2 → New P2). There is no swap.\n        *   Therefore, the stereochemical designation is retained. An (S)-starting material will yield an (S)-product.\n        *   The problem states that `(S)-lactone` is formed. Thus, starting material **B must be (S)**.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\n\nBoth starting materials, A and B, must be the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n*   **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n*   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
