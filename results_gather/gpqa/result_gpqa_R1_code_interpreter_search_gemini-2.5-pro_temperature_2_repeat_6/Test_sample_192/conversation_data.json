    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the fundamental relationship between distance and parallax.**\n    Parallax (plx) is the apparent shift in the position of a star against a distant background as observed from two different points in Earth's orbit. It is inversely proportional to the distance (r) to the star.\n    The mathematical relationship is:\n    `plx = 1/r`\n    This also means that distance can be expressed as:\n    `r = 1/plx`\n\n2.  **Define the given information.**\n    The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax, `plx`, as `1/plx^5`. This means the number of stars per unit interval of parallax, which we can write as a differential `dN/d(plx)`, is proportional to `1/plx^5`.\n    So, `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`.\n\n3.  **State the goal.**\n    We need to find how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance. In other words, we need to find the proportionality for `dN/dr`.\n\n4.  **Relate the differentials `dN/d(plx)` and `dN/dr`.**\n    We can use the chain rule from calculus to relate the two derivatives:\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the term `d(plx)/dr`.**\n    Since we know `plx = 1/r = r⁻¹`, we can differentiate `plx` with respect to `r`:\n    `d(plx)/dr = d/dr(r⁻¹) = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n\n6.  **Express `dN/d(plx)` in terms of `r`.**\n    We are given `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`. Since `plx = 1/r`, it follows that `1/plx = r`.\n    Substituting this into the proportionality gives:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ (r)^5 = r^5`\n\n7.  **Combine the pieces to find `dN/dr`.**\n    Now substitute the expressions from steps 5 and 6 into the chain rule equation from step 4:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (r^5) * (-1/r²)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ -r^(5-2)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ -r³`\n\n8.  **Interpret the result.**\n    The number of stars in a given range of distance (`dN`) must be a positive quantity for an increasing distance interval (`dr`). The negative sign arises from the inverse relationship between distance and parallax (as `r` increases, `plx` decreases). When considering the distribution or density of stars, we are interested in the magnitude of this relationship. We can think of transforming the infinitesimal element `d(plx)` to `dr`. From `d(plx)/dr = -1/r²`, we get `|d(plx)| = |dr/r²|`.\n    The number of stars `dN` in a small parallax interval `d(plx)` is `dN ∝ (1/plx^5) |d(plx)|`.\n    Substituting the relationships in terms of `r`:\n    `dN ∝ (r^5) * |dr/r²|`\n    Dividing by `dr` to get the number per unit distance:\n    `dN/dr ∝ r^5 / r^2`\n    `dN/dr ∝ r³`\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance changes in proportion to `r³`.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) ~ r^3\nB) ~ r^4\nC) ~ r^2\nD) ~ r^5\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
