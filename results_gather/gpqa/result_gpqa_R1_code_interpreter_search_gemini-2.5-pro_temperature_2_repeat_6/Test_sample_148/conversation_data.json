    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the experimental data:**\n    *   **Observation 1 (Â¹H NMR):** There are two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton. Their integrals are roughly equal and sum up to the expected value of one proton (1H). Spin-spin coupling is not the cause.\n        *   *Interpretation:* This means the alpha-proton exists in two different chemical environments. Since the integrals are equal, these two environments are present in a roughly 1:1 ratio in the sample. In NMR spectroscopy, non-equivalent protons give rise to different signals (chemical shifts).\n    *   **Observation 2 (LC-MS):** Liquid Chromatography (LC) at an elevated temperature shows two separate peaks with equal intensities. Mass Spectrometry (MS) analysis of both peaks shows the same mass, which is consistent with the expected product.\n        *   *Interpretation:* The sample contains two different compounds that can be separated by chromatography, and they are present in a 1:1 ratio (equal intensities). Since they have the same mass as the expected product, they are isomers of the product, not impurities with different chemical formulas (like precursors or side-products with different molecular weights). The elevated temperature ensures that the two species are stable and don't interconvert during the chromatography run, leading to sharp, well-defined peaks.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the options based on the analysis:**\n\n    *   **A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor molecule would, by definition, have a different chemical structure and therefore a different molecular weight. The MS data shows both peaks have the *same* mass as the expected final product, which contradicts this option.\n\n    *   **B) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This would mean an extra amino acid has been added to the peptide chain. This would result in a product with a significantly higher molecular weight than expected. Again, this is contradicted by the MS data showing the expected mass.\n\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n        *   **Definition:** Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. This occurs in molecules with two or more chiral centers when at least one, but not all, of the chiral centers is inverted relative to the other stereoisomer. For example, if you are making a dipeptide from L-Alanine and L-Valine, the target is L-Ala-L-Val. If the L-Valine starting material was contaminated with D-Valine, you would produce a mixture of L-Ala-L-Val and L-Ala-D-Val. These two molecules are diastereomers.\n        *   **NMR Compatibility:** Diastereomers have different physical and chemical properties. Their molecules are not energetically equivalent. Therefore, corresponding protons in diastereomers are in different chemical environments and are expected to have different chemical shifts in an NMR spectrum. A 1:1 mixture would produce two sets of peaks with equal integrals, which perfectly matches the NMR data.\n        *   **LC-MS Compatibility:** Because diastereomers have different physical properties, they can be separated by standard (achiral) chromatography techniques like LC. A mixture of two diastereomers would be expected to show two separate peaks. Since they have the same chemical formula, they will have the identical molecular weight, which perfectly matches the MS data. This option is fully consistent with all observations.\n\n    *   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n        *   **Definition:** Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other (like a left and right hand).\n        *   **NMR Compatibility:** Enantiomers have identical chemical and physical properties in an achiral environment. A standard NMR experiment uses an achiral solvent. Therefore, enantiomers are indistinguishable by standard NMR and would produce a single, identical set of peaks. This contradicts the observation of two peaks for the alpha-proton.\n        *   **LC-MS Compatibility:** Similarly, enantiomers cannot be separated by standard (achiral) LC. A mixture would appear as a single peak. This contradicts the observation of two LC peaks.\n\n**Conclusion:** The only explanation that is consistent with all the experimental data (two non-coupled NMR peaks, two separable LC peaks, and identical mass spectra) is that the crude compound is a mixture of diastereomers. This is a common outcome in peptide synthesis if one of the chiral amino acid building blocks was not enantiomerically pure.\n\n<<<C>>>"
