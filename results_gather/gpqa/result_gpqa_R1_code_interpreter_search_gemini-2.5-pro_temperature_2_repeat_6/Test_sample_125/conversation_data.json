    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a ketone with one pre-existing chiral center at carbon 5 (C5), which has the (S) configuration. The carbonyl carbon at C3 is prochiral.\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H3O+). LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone to a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Product:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. This new center can have either an (R) or (S) configuration. The original stereocenter at C5 is not affected by the reaction.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reaction will produce a mixture of two products:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   These two products are **diastereomers** because they have two stereocenters, with one being the same (5S) and the other being different (3R vs. 3S). The reaction is unlikely to be 100% diastereoselective, so both products will be formed.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone). This molecule is achiral and symmetric.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4) followed by an acidic workup. NaBH4 is a reducing agent that reduces ketones. Since it is in excess, both carbonyl groups at C2 and C4 will be reduced to hydroxyl groups.\n*   **Product:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol, CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. Because the starting material and reagent are achiral, all possible stereoisomers will be formed. Let's analyze the possibilities:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   The molecule is symmetric around C3. The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other; they are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since they are formed from an achiral precursor with an achiral reagent, they will be produced in a 1:1 ratio, forming a racemic mixture.\n*   The (2R, 4S) isomer has a plane of symmetry (and is superimposable on its mirror image, the (2S, 4R) isomer). Therefore, it is a **meso compound**.\n*   The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the enantiomeric pair.\n*   So, Reaction II produces three distinct stereoisomers: a racemic mixture of (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, and meso-pentane-2,4-diol.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC is an achiral technique. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   It can separate **constitutional isomers** and **diastereomers**.\n*   It **cannot** separate **enantiomers**.\n*   The combined mixture contains five compounds in total:\n    *   From Rxn I: (3R, 5S)-diol and (3S, 5S)-diol. These are diastereomers and have different physical properties, so they will be separated into **two peaks**.\n    *   From Rxn II: a racemic mixture and a meso compound. These are diastereomers and have different physical properties, so they will be separated. The racemic pair will elute together as one peak, and the meso compound will elute as a separate peak. This gives **two peaks**.\n    *   The products of Reaction I (C7H16O2) are constitutional isomers of the products of Reaction II (C5H12O2). They have different molecular formulas, structures, and polarities. Therefore, the peaks from Reaction I will not overlap with the peaks from Reaction II.\n*   Total peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase. It is designed to separate enantiomers. It can also separate diastereomers and constitutional isomers.\n*   The column will have different interactions with each of the five unique stereoisomers in the mixture.\n*   Let's count the separable species:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 1)\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 2, diastereomer of 1, separable)\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 3)\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 4, enantiomer of 3, separable on a chiral column)\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 5, diastereomer of 3 & 4, separable)\n*   Assuming no accidental co-elution, the chiral column will resolve all five stereoisomers.\n*   Total peaks in chiral HPLC = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Normal-phase HPLC will show **4 peaks**.\n*   Chiral HPLC will show **5 peaks**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\nThere is a possible alternative interpretation where the question assumes low resolution for diastereomers on a normal-phase column, leading to 2 peaks. However, this contradicts the \"high-performance\" nature of HPLC. The interpretation that leads to option D requires several inconsistent assumptions (e.g., ignoring the products of one reaction in the second analysis), making it chemically less plausible. The most rigorous and consistent analysis points to 4 peaks on the normal-phase column and 5 peaks on the chiral-phase column.\n\nLet's revisit the options and reasoning.\n- Normal-Phase (achiral):\n  - (3R,5S)-diol vs (3S,5S)-diol -> diastereomers, separate (Peak 1, Peak 2)\n  - (rac)-diol vs (meso)-diol -> diastereomers, separate (Peak 3, Peak 4)\n  - C7 compounds vs C5 compounds are very different -> no overlap expected.\n  - **Result: 4 peaks**\n- Chiral Phase:\n  - Separates everything above.\n  - Additionally, separates the racemic pair: (R,R)-diol and (S,S)-diol become two separate peaks.\n  - The 4 peaks from normal phase become 5: Peak 1, Peak 2, Peak 3a (RR), Peak 3b (SS), Peak 4 (meso).\n  - **Result: 5 peaks**\n\nFinal Answer: 5 peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.\n\nFinal check of the question options against my conclusion.\nA) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nB) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nC) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC\nD) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\n\nMy conclusion matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
