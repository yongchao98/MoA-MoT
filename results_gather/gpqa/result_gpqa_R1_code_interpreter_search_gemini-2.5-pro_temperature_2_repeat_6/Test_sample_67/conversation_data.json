    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Initial State (t < 0):**\n    *   A spin-1/2 particle has a magnetic moment `μ = γS`, where `S` is the spin operator and `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n    *   The magnetic field is `B_initial = B * ẑ` (pointing in the +Z direction).\n    *   The Hamiltonian for this initial system is `H_initial = -μ ⋅ B_initial = - (γS) ⋅ (B ẑ) = -γB * Sz`.\n    *   The particle is \"aligned\" with the field. This means it is in the lowest energy eigenstate. The energy `E = -γB * m_s * ħ`, where `m_s` is the spin quantum number. To minimize energy, we need `m_s` to be as large and positive as possible (assuming `γ` is positive, which is typical for electron spin, `γ_e < 0`, but for nuclei it can be positive. However, the dynamics don't depend on the sign of `γ`). The `Sz` eigenstates are `|+z>` (spin up, eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and `|-z>` (spin down, eigenvalue `-ħ/2`). The \"aligned\" or low-energy state is `|+z>`.\n    *   So, the state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the System for t ≥ 0:**\n    *   The magnetic field is suddenly changed to `B_final = B * ŷ` (pointing in the +Y direction). The term \"suddenly\" implies that the state of the particle does not have time to change at the instant of the switch. So, the state at `t=0` is still `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n    *   The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution for `t ≥ 0` is `H = -μ ⋅ B_final = - (γS) ⋅ (B ŷ) = -γB * Sy`.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution of the State:**\n    *   The state `|ψ(t)>` will evolve according to the Schrödinger equation with the new Hamiltonian `H`: `|ψ(t)> = e^(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)>`.\n    *   To calculate this, it's easiest to express the initial state `|ψ(0)>` in the basis of the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian `H` (which are the eigenstates of `Sy`).\n    *   The eigenstates of `Sy` are `|+y>` and `|-y>`, with eigenvalues `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2` respectively. In the `Sz` basis (`|+z> = (1, 0)`, `|-z> = (0, 1)`), they are:\n        *   `|+y> = (1/√2) * (|+z> + i|-z>)`\n        *   `|-y> = (1/√2) * (|+z> - i|-z>)`\n    *   We can write the initial state `|+z>` as a superposition of these `Sy` eigenstates:\n        *   `|+z> = (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value `<μz>(t)`:**\n    We need to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is `<μz>(t)> = <ψ(t)| μz |ψ(t)> = γ<ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)> = γ<Sz>(t)`. Let's calculate `<Sz>(t)`.\n\n    **Method 1: State Vector Evolution**\n    *   First, find the energy eigenvalues for the Hamiltonian `H = -γB * Sy`.\n        *   `E_+` (for state `|+y>`): `H|+y> = -γB * Sy|+y> = -γB * (ħ/2) * |+y>`. So `E_+ = -γBħ/2`.\n        *   `E_-` (for state `|-y>`): `H|-y> = -γB * Sy|-y> = -γB * (-ħ/2) * |-y>`. So `E_- = +γBħ/2`.\n    *   Now, evolve the state `|ψ(0)>`:\n        `|ψ(t)> = e^(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)> = e^(-iHt/ħ) * (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>)`\n        `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [ e^(-iE_+t/ħ)|+y> + e^(-iE_-t/ħ)|-y> ]`\n        `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [ e^(iγBt/2)|+y> + e^(-iγBt/2)|-y> ]`\n    *   To calculate `<Sz>(t)`, let's substitute the `Sy` eigenstates back with their `Sz` basis representation:\n        `|ψ(t)> = (1/2) * [ e^(iγBt/2)(|+z> + i|-z>) + e^(-iγBt/2)(|+z> - i|-z>) ]`\n        `|ψ(t)> = (1/2) * [ (e^(iγBt/2) + e^(-iγBt/2))|+z> + i(e^(iγBt/2) - e^(-iγBt/2))|-z> ]`\n    *   Using Euler's formulas (`cosθ = (e^(iθ)+e^(-iθ))/2`, `sinθ = (e^(iθ)-e^(-iθ))/2i`):\n        `|ψ(t)> = cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>`\n    *   Now, calculate `<Sz>(t) = <ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)>`:\n        `<Sz>(t) = (cos(γBt/2)<+z| - sin(γBt/2)<-z|) * Sz * (cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>)`\n        Since `Sz|+z> = (ħ/2)|+z>` and `Sz|-z> = (-ħ/2)|-z>`, we get:\n        `<Sz>(t) = (ħ/2) * [cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2)]`\n    *   Using the double-angle identity `cos(2θ) = cos²θ - sin²θ`:\n        `<Sz>(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(2 * γBt/2) = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n\n    **Method 2: Ehrenfest's Theorem / Larmor Precession**\n    *   The time evolution of the expectation value of an operator `A` is given by `d<A>/dt = (i/ħ)<[H, A]>`.\n    *   Let's find the equations of motion for `<S>`.\n        `d<S>/dt = (i/ħ) * <[H, S]> = (i/ħ) * <[-γB * Sy, S]> = (-iγB/ħ) * <[Sy, S]>`\n    *   For the z-component:\n        `d<Sz>/dt = (-iγB/ħ) * <[Sy, Sz]>`\n    *   Using the commutation relation `[Sy, Sz] = iħSx`:\n        `d<Sz>/dt = (-iγB/ħ) * (iħ<Sx>) = γB<Sx>`\n    *   Similarly, for the x-component, using `[Sy, Sx] = -iħSz`:\n        `d<Sx>/dt = (-iγB/ħ) * <[Sy, Sx]> = (-iγB/ħ) * (-iħ<Sz>) = -γB<Sz>`\n    *   We now have a system of two coupled differential equations. We can solve it by differentiating the first equation:\n        `d²<Sz>/dt² = γB * d<Sx>/dt`\n    *   Substitute the second equation into this:\n        `d²<Sz>/dt² = γB * (-γB<Sz>) = -(γB)²<Sz>`\n    *   This is the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator, `x''(t) = -Ω²x(t)`, where `x(t)` is `<Sz>(t)` and the angular frequency of oscillation `Ω` is `γB`.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Both methods show that the expectation value `<Sz>(t)` oscillates as `cos(γBt)`.\n    *   The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is `<μz>(t) = γ<Sz>(t) = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n    *   The argument of the cosine function is `Ωt`, where `Ω` is the angular frequency. By inspection, the oscillation frequency is `Ω = γB`. This frequency is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\nThe question asks for the oscillation frequency, which is `γB`.\n\nFinal check with the options:\nA) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nB) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nC) gamma*B/2\nD) gamma*B\n\nOur result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
