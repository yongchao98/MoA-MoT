    "This problem can be solved using the method of images in electrostatics.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Problem:** We need to find the total potential energy of a system consisting of a point charge `q` and a grounded conducting sphere. The work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position is equal to the potential energy of the system.\n\n2.  **Apply the Method of Images:** The electric field outside the sphere due to the induced charges on its surface can be modeled by a single \"image charge\" `q'` placed inside the sphere. The combination of the original charge `q` and this image charge `q'` must satisfy the boundary condition that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero (since it's grounded).\n\n3.  **Determine the Image Charge and its Position:** For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`, the equivalent image charge `q'` and its position `b` (from the center) are given by:\n    *   Image charge magnitude: `q' = - (R/d) * q`\n    *   Image charge position: `b = R^2 / d`\n\n    These values are chosen precisely so that the sum of the potentials from `q` and `q'` is zero at any point on the spherical surface of radius `R`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy:** The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to the distance `d`. This work is done against the force exerted by the induced charges on the sphere. In our image model, this is the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\n    A crucial point in the method of images is that the potential energy of the *actual* system (charge `q` and the sphere) is **not** simply the potential energy between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`. This is because the image charge itself doesn't have its own energy; it's a mathematical construct representing the induced field.\n\n    The correct way to calculate the potential energy `U` is to find the potential `V'` created by the image charge `q'` at the location of the real charge `q`, and then the energy is `U = (1/2) * q * V'`. The factor of 1/2 is essential and arises because the induced charge (and thus the image charge) builds up as the real charge is brought in from infinity.\n\n5.  **Step-by-step Calculation:**\n    *   **Image charge:** `q' = -qR/d`\n    *   **Image position:** `b = R^2/d`\n    *   **Distance between real charge `q` and image charge `q'`:**\n        `distance = d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n    *   **Potential `V'` at the location of `q` (at distance `d`) due to the image charge `q'`:**\n        `V' = k * q' / (distance)`\n        `V' = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n        By canceling `d` from the numerator and denominator, we get:\n        `V' = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n    *   **Calculate the net potential energy `U` of the system:**\n        `U = (1/2) * q * V'`\n        `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated expression for the potential energy is `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`. This matches option D.\n\nThe energy is negative, which is physically correct because the charge `q` is attracted to the conducting sphere (as the induced charge on the closer surface is of the opposite sign), meaning the system is in a lower energy state than when the charge is infinitely far away (U=0).\n\n<<<D>>>"
