    "This problem requires the application of the relativistic velocity addition formula. Here is a step-by-step derivation of the answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the frames of reference:**\n    *   The \"laboratory frame\" is the stationary observer's frame of reference.\n    *   The \"glass frame\" is the moving frame of reference, which is moving at a velocity *v* relative to the laboratory.\n\n2.  **Determine the speed of light in each frame:**\n    *   In the glass's own rest frame, the speed of light is determined by the refractive index *n*. Given that the speed of light in a vacuum (*c*) is set to 1, the speed of light within the glass (let's call it *u'*) is *u' = c/n = 1/n*.\n    *   The glass itself is moving with velocity *v* in the same direction as the light beam, as measured by the observer in the laboratory.\n\n3.  **Apply the Einstein velocity addition formula:**\n    The classical way of simply adding velocities (*u' + v*) is incorrect at relativistic speeds. Instead, we must use Einstein's formula for the addition of velocities, which correctly accounts for the principles of special relativity. The formula for collinear motion is:\n\n    *u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'v/c²)*\n\n    Where:\n    *   *u* is the velocity of the object (the light beam) as seen by the stationary observer (in the laboratory).\n    *   *u'* is the velocity of the object in the moving frame (the speed of light in the glass).\n    *   *v* is the velocity of the moving frame (the glass) relative to the stationary observer.\n    *   *c* is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\n4.  **Substitute the given values into the formula:**\n    We have:\n    *   *u'* = 1/n\n    *   *v* = v\n    *   *c* = 1\n\n    Substituting these into the velocity addition formula gives:\n\n    *u = (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n)*v / 1²)*\n\n5.  **Simplify the expression:**\n    First, simplify the denominator:\n\n    *u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)*\n\n    To eliminate the fractions within the numerator and denominator, find a common denominator, which is *n*:\n\n    *u = [(1 + nv) / n] / [(n + v) / n]*\n\n    The *n* in the denominator of the numerator and the denominator of the denominator cancels out, leaving:\n\n    *u = (1 + nv) / (n + v)*\n\nThis result matches the formula derived by Max von Laue in 1907, who showed that the Fresnel dragging coefficient observed in the Fizeau experiment is a natural consequence of the relativistic velocity addition formula.\n\nComparing this final expression with the given options:\n\nA) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\nB) 1\nC) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\nD) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n\nThe calculated speed of light in the glass relative to the observer is (1+n*v)/(n+v).\n\n<<<C>>>"
