    "### Summary of Star Properties and Observability\n\nTo determine how many of the listed stars are detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph, each star's visibility from the Paranal Observatory and its apparent magnitude must be assessed. A star is considered detectable if a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel can be achieved in a one-hour exposure.\n\nFirst, the location of the Paranal Observatory is crucial. It is situated at a latitude of approximately -24.6 degrees. This southern latitude restricts the visibility of stars in the far northern sky. An object's observability is determined by its declination.\n\nThe ESPRESSO instrument, when coupled with a single 8m VLT telescope, has a limiting V-band magnitude of about 17 in High-Resolution mode (HR) and about 16 in Ultra-High-Resolution mode (UHR) for achieving an S/N of 10 in a one-hour exposure. The ESPRESSO User Manual provides a graph showing the relationship between S/N and stellar magnitude for a one-hour (3600s) exposure in single HR mode, which confirms that an S/N of 10 is reached at an apparent magnitude of roughly 16-17.\n\nHere is a star-by-star analysis:\n\n*   **a) Canopus:** This is the second brightest star in the night sky, with an apparent magnitude of -0.74. Its declination is about -52 degrees 42 minutes. Given its southern declination, Canopus is easily observable from Paranal and its extreme brightness ensures it is detectable.\n\n*   **b) Polaris:** Known as the North Star, Polaris has an apparent magnitude of approximately 1.98. However, its declination is +89 degrees 15 minutes. From Paranal's southern latitude of -24.6 degrees, Polaris is permanently below the horizon and therefore not observable.\n\n*   **c) Star with Absolute V magnitude of 15 at 10 pc:** The apparent magnitude (m) can be calculated using the absolute magnitude (M) and distance (d) with the formula: m = M + 5*log10(d/10).\n    *   m = 15 + 5*log10(10/10) = 15.\n    This star has an apparent magnitude of 15. With a declination of 0 degrees, it is observable from Paranal. An apparent magnitude of 15 is within the detection limit of ESPRESSO for a one-hour exposure to achieve an S/N of 10.\n\n*   **d) Star with Absolute V magnitude of 15 at 200 pc:** Using the same formula:\n    *   m = 15 + 5*log10(200/10) = 15 + 5*log10(20) ≈ 15 + 5*1.301 = 21.5.\n    An apparent magnitude of 21.5 is too faint for ESPRESSO to achieve the required S/N in one hour.\n\n*   **e) Star with Absolute V magnitude of 15 at 5 pc:**\n    *   m = 15 + 5*log10(5/10) = 15 + 5*log10(0.5) ≈ 15 - 1.5 = 13.5.\n    This star has an apparent magnitude of 13.5. It is observable from Paranal (declination 0 degrees) and is bright enough for detection by ESPRESSO.\n\n*   **f) Star with Absolute V magnitude of 15 at 50 pc:**\n    *   m = 15 + 5*log10(50/10) = 15 + 5*log10(5) ≈ 15 + 3.5 = 18.5.\n    An apparent magnitude of 18.5 is fainter than the limiting magnitude of ~17 for achieving an S/N of 10 in one hour with ESPRESSO.\n\nIn summary, the detectable stars are Canopus, the star at 10 pc (apparent magnitude 15), and the star at 5 pc (apparent magnitude 13.5). Polaris is not observable, and the stars at 200 pc and 50 pc are too faint. Therefore, a total of 3 stars are detectable.\n\n<<<A>>>"
