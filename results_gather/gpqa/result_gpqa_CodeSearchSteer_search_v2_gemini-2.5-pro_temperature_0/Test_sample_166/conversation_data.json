    "Here is a step-by-step calculation of the non-Gaussianity (nG) for the given Schrödinger cat state.\n\n**1. Define the State and Parameters**\n\nThe Schrödinger cat state is given by:\n|ψ⟩ = (cos(φ)|α⟩ + sin(φ)|-α⟩) / N\n\nThe given parameters are:\n*   Amplitude, α = 0.5\n*   Phase, φ = -π / 4\n\nFirst, we determine the specific state for these parameters.\n*   cos(-π/4) = 1/√2\n*   sin(-π/4) = -1/√2\n*   sin(2φ) = sin(-π/2) = -1\n\nThe normalization constant N is:\nN = √[1 + sin(2φ) * exp(-2α²)] = √[1 - exp(-2 * 0.5²)] = √[1 - exp(-0.5)]\n\nSubstituting these into the state vector gives:\n|ψ⟩ = ( (1/√2)|α⟩ - (1/√2)|-α⟩ ) / N = (1 / (√2 * N)) * (|α⟩ - |-α⟩)\nThis is known as an odd Schrödinger cat state.\n\n**2. Understand the Measure of Non-Gaussianity**\n\nThe relative entropy measure of non-Gaussianity is:\nδ_b = S(τ) - S(ρ)\nwhere:\n*   ρ = |ψ⟩⟨ψ| is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state.\n*   τ is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state that has the same first and second moments as ρ.\n*   S(σ) = -Tr(σ ln σ) is the von Neumann entropy.\n\nSince |ψ⟩ is a pure state, its density matrix ρ has one eigenvalue equal to 1 and all others equal to 0. Therefore, the entropy of the state ρ is S(ρ) = -(1 * ln(1)) = 0.\n\nThis simplifies the non-Gaussianity to be the entropy of the reference Gaussian state:\nδ_b = S(τ)\n\n**3. Calculate the Moments of the State ρ**\n\nTo define the reference state τ, we need the first and second moments of ρ.\n\n*   **First Moment (Mean Displacement):** ⟨a⟩\n    For an odd cat state, the mean displacement is zero.\n    ⟨a⟩ = ⟨ψ|a|ψ⟩ = 0\n\n*   **Second Moments:** ⟨a²⟩ and ⟨a†a⟩\n    For an odd cat state, these are given by:\n    *   ⟨a²⟩ = α²\n    *   ⟨a†a⟩ = α² * coth(α²)\n\n    With α = 0.5, we have α² = 0.25.\n    *   ⟨a²⟩ = 0.25\n    *   ⟨a†a⟩ = 0.25 * coth(0.25) ≈ 0.25 * 4.083 = 1.02075\n\n**4. Determine the Reference Gaussian State τ and its Entropy**\n\nThe entropy of a single-mode Gaussian state is determined by its symplectic eigenvalue, `d`. The entropy is given by the formula:\nS(τ) = (d + 1/2) * ln(d + 1/2) - (d - 1/2) * ln(d - 1/2)\n\nThe symplectic eigenvalue `d` is the square root of the determinant of the covariance matrix V. The elements of V are determined by the moments of the state.\n\n*   **Covariance Matrix V:**\n    The elements of the covariance matrix for a state with zero displacement are:\n    *   V_qq = ⟨q²⟩ = Re(⟨a²⟩) + ⟨a†a⟩ + 1/2\n    *   V_pp = ⟨p²⟩ = -Re(⟨a²⟩) + ⟨a†a⟩ + 1/2\n    *   V_qp = Im(⟨a²⟩) = 0 (since ⟨a²⟩ is real)\n\n    Plugging in the values:\n    *   V_qq = 0.25 + 1.02075 + 0.5 = 1.77075\n    *   V_pp = -0.25 + 1.02075 + 0.5 = 1.27075\n\n*   **Symplectic Eigenvalue d:**\n    d = √det(V) = √(V_qq * V_pp)\n    d = √(1.77075 * 1.27075) = √2.25018 ≈ 1.5\n\n*   **Entropy of τ:**\n    Now we calculate S(τ) with d = 1.5.\n    *   S(τ) = (1.5 + 0.5) * ln(1.5 + 0.5) - (1.5 - 0.5) * ln(1.5 - 0.5)\n    *   S(τ) = 2 * ln(2) - 1 * ln(1)\n    *   Since ln(1) = 0, S(τ) = 2 * ln(2)\n    *   S(τ) ≈ 2 * 0.6931 = 1.3862\n\nThe amount of non-Gaussianity is approximately 1.38.\n\n<<<B>>>"
