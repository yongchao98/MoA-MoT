    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of product 3 and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n**Step 1: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid.**\nThis reaction is the electrophilic aromatic substitution (nitration) of toluene. The methyl group (-CH3) on toluene is an ortho-, para-director. The reaction yields a mixture of ortho-nitrotoluene and para-nitrotoluene. Typically, in a multi-step synthesis problem without specified separation, the major, sterically unhindered product is carried forward. Therefore, **Product 1 is p-nitrotoluene (4-nitrotoluene)**.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4.**\nThis step involves the oxidation of p-nitrotoluene. Manganese dioxide (MnO2) in the presence of sulfuric acid is an oxidizing agent capable of converting the methyl group of p-nitrotoluene into an aldehyde. While stronger conditions or different oxidizing agents could produce a carboxylic acid, the formation of an aldehyde is a known outcome. Therefore, **Product 2 is p-nitrobenzaldehyde (4-nitrobenzaldehyde)**.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide.**\nThis reaction is a base-catalyzed crossed aldol condensation, specifically a Claisen-Schmidt condensation. The base (sodium hydroxide) removes an acidic α-hydrogen from acetone to form an enolate. This enolate then attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of p-nitrobenzaldehyde. The resulting β-hydroxy ketone intermediate readily dehydrates to form a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated ketone. The major product is the more stable E-isomer. Therefore, **Product 3 is (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n\n**Determining the Molecular Symmetry Group of Product 3**\nThe structure of Product 3 is (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one. To determine its molecular symmetry group, we must identify its symmetry elements.\n\n*   **Structure:** The molecule consists of a p-nitrophenyl group connected to an (E)-but-3-en-2-one chain (`O2N-C6H4-CH=CH-C(O)CH3`).\n*   **Planarity:** Due to the extended π-conjugation system across the benzene ring, the vinyl group, and the carbonyl group, the main backbone of the molecule is planar. This plane contains the benzene ring, the nitro group's nitrogen and oxygens, the C=C double bond, and the carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   **Symmetry Elements:**\n    *   **Identity (E):** All molecules have this element.\n    *   **Plane of Symmetry (σ):** The molecule has a single plane of symmetry, which is the plane of the molecule itself. The methyl group (-CH3) can rotate so that one of its hydrogen atoms lies in this plane, with the other two positioned symmetrically above and below it.\n    *   **Rotation Axes (Cn):** There are no rotation axes (for n > 1). A C2 axis is not present because rotating the molecule 180 degrees does not result in an identical structure due to the asymmetry of the `-C(O)CH3` group.\n    *   **Center of Inversion (i):** The molecule does not have a center of inversion.\n\nA molecule that possesses only the identity element (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ) belongs to the **Cs** point group.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of product 3 is Cs.\n\n<<<A>>>"
