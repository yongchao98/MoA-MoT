    "The analysis of the reaction products and their behavior in different chromatographic systems is as follows:\n\n### Reaction Analysis\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** The treatment of (E)-oct-4-ene (a trans-alkene) with mCPBA results in a syn-epoxidation, forming a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane. The subsequent acid-catalyzed ring-opening of this epoxide by water is an anti-addition. This sequence of syn-epoxidation followed by anti-ring-opening on a trans-alkene results in the formation of a single meso compound, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n*   **Reaction 2:** The treatment of (Z)-oct-4-ene (a cis-alkene) with mCPBA also proceeds via syn-epoxidation, yielding the meso epoxide, (Z)-4,5-epoxyoctane. The subsequent acid-catalyzed anti-ring-opening of this meso epoxide produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomers: (4R,4R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### Product Mixture\n\nThe combined product mixture from both reactions contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (a meso compound from Reaction 1)\n2.  (4R,4R)-octane-4,5-diol (an enantiomer from Reaction 2)\n3.  (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (an enantiomer from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is that the meso compound is a diastereomer to the two enantiomers. The (4R,4R) and (4S,5S) isomers are an enantiomeric pair.\n\n### Chromatographic Separation\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:** This technique separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated. Enantiomers, however, have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will therefore elute together, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   The meso-diol and the enantiomeric pair of diols are diastereomers and will be separated.\n    *   The two enantiomers will co-elute.\n    *   Consequently, the chromatogram will show **two peaks**.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This method utilizes a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with each enantiomer, allowing for their separation. It can also separate diastereomers.\n    *   The meso compound will produce one peak.\n    *   The two enantiomers, (4R,4R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, will be resolved from each other, each producing a separate peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will display a total of **three peaks**.\n\nBased on this analysis, the chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<C>>>"
