    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct compound:\n\n### 1. Analysis of FTIR Data\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H bond in a carboxylic acid that is undergoing hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n\nBoth pieces of FTIR data strongly indicate that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n### 2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data\n\nThe key to identifying the correct structure lies in the complex splitting patterns described in the ¹H NMR spectrum. We need to find a molecule that contains protons with the following specific environments:\n\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**: This means the proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   A set of 1 proton (giving the **d**oublet, n=1)\n    *   A set of 2 protons (giving the **t**riplet, n=2)\n    *   A set of 3 protons (giving the **q**uartet, n=3)\n    *(Note: The order of the splitting, like qtd or tqd, depends on the relative size of the coupling constants, but the set of multiplicities is the key feature).*\n\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**: This means the proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   A set of 1 proton (giving the **d**oublet, n=1)\n    *   A set of 2 protons (giving one **t**riplet, n=2)\n    *   Another, different set of 2 protons (giving the second **t**riplet, n=2)\n\nNow, let's analyze the structure of each option to see which one would produce both of these signals.\n\n---\n\n**A) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-Dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n`COOH-CH₂(e)-CH(d)(CH₃c)-CH(b)(CH₃a)₂`\n*   The proton `Hd` is coupled to `Hc` (3H), `Hb` (1H), and `He` (2H). This would result in a quartet of doublets of triplets (qdt), which matches the multiplicities of a `dtq`.\n*   However, there is no proton in this molecule coupled to one proton and two different sets of two protons. Thus, it cannot produce a `dtt` signal.\n\n**B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (3,4-Diethylhexanoic acid)**\n`COOH-CH₂(i)-CH(h)(C₂H₅g)-CH(f)(C₂H₅d,e)-CH₂(b)CH₃(a)`\n*   The proton `Hh` is coupled to `Hf` (1H), its ethyl `CH₂` `Hg` (2H), and the backbone `CH₂` `Hi` (2H). This would result in a **dtt** signal.\n*   There is no proton in this molecule coupled to a set of 1H, 2H, and 3H neighbors. Thus, it cannot produce a `dtq` signal.\n\n**C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-Dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n`COOH-CH(f)(CH₃g)-CH(d)(CH₃e)-CH₂(b)CH₃(a)`\n*   The proton `Hd` is coupled to `Hf` (1H), `He` (3H), and `Hb` (2H). This would result in a doublet of quartets of triplets (dqt), which matches the multiplicities of a `dtq`.\n*   There is no proton in this molecule that can produce a `dtt` signal.\n\n**D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-Diethylpentanoic acid)**\nLet's draw the structure and label the key protons:\n`COOH-CH₂(h)-CH(g)(CH₂f-CH₃e)-CH(b)(CH₂c-CH₃d)-CH₃(a)`\n\n*   **Analysis of proton `Hg` (at position 4):**\n    *   It is adjacent to proton `Hb` (1H), which will split it into a **doublet**.\n    *   It is adjacent to the `CH₂` of its own ethyl group, `Hf` (2H), which will split it into a **triplet**.\n    *   It is adjacent to the `CH₂` group in the main chain, `Hh` (2H), which will split it into another **triplet**.\n    *   Therefore, the signal for `Hg` is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the required signals.\n\n*   **Analysis of proton `Hb` (at position 3):**\n    *   It is adjacent to proton `Hg` (1H), which will split it into a **doublet**.\n    *   It is adjacent to the `CH₂` of its own ethyl group, `Hc` (2H), which will split it into a **triplet**.\n    *   It is adjacent to the terminal methyl group, `Ha` (3H), which will split it into a **quartet**.\n    *   Therefore, the signal for `Hb` is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)** (or qtd/tqd depending on J-values). This matches the other required signal.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCompound D, 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, is the only structure that contains a proton environment that gives a doublet of triplets of triplets (`dtt`) and a different proton environment that gives a doublet of triplets of quartets (`dtq`).\n\n<<<D>>>"
