    "The search results confirm the underlying physics principles used in the initial reasoning.\n\n*   **Transit Probability:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the geometric probability of it transiting its star is approximated by the ratio of the stellar radius (R_star) to the planet's semi-major axis (a). This confirms the formula `p ≈ R_star / a`.\n\n*   **Kepler's Third Law:** The square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a) and inversely proportional to the mass of its host star (M_star). The law can be expressed as `P² ∝ a³ / M_star`, which can be rearranged to find the semi-major axis: `a³ ∝ P² * M_star`, or `a ∝ (P² * M_star)^(1/3)`.\n\nThe initial step-by-step derivation is correct based on these principles.\n\n1.  **Transit Probability Ratio:**\n    *   p1 ≈ R_star1 / a1\n    *   p2 ≈ R_star2 / a2\n    *   Given R_star1 = R_star2, the ratio of probabilities is p1 / p2 = a2 / a1.\n\n2.  **Semi-Major Axis Ratio from Kepler's Third Law:**\n    *   a1 ∝ (M_star1 * P1²)^(1/3)\n    *   a2 ∝ (M_star2 * P2²)^(1/3)\n    *   The ratio a2 / a1 = [ (M_star2 * P2²) / (M_star1 * P1²) ]^(1/3).\n\n3.  **Substituting the Given Values:**\n    *   M_star1 = 2 * M_star2\n    *   P1 = P2 / 3  => P2 = 3 * P1\n    *   a2 / a1 = [ (M_star2 * (3 * P1)²) / ((2 * M_star2) * P1²) ]^(1/3)\n    *   a2 / a1 = [ (9 * M_star2 * P1²) / (2 * M_star2 * P1²) ]^(1/3)\n    *   a2 / a1 = (9 / 2)^(1/3) = (4.5)^(1/3)\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   (4.5)^(1/3) ≈ 1.65096...\n    *   Therefore, p1 / p2 ≈ 1.65.\n\nPlanet_1 has a transit probability that is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
