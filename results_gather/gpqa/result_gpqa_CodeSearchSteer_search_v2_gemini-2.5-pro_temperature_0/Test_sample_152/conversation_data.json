    "Here is a breakdown of the reactants and products for each reaction:\n\n**Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n*   **Michael Donor:** Dimethyl malonate. The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), removes an acidic α-proton from the carbon between the two ester groups, creating a nucleophilic enolate.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester.\n*   **Reaction:** The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate. Subsequent protonation yields the final product.\n*   **Product (A):** The resulting structure is `(MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOMe`. The IUPAC name for this compound is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n**Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)**\n\n*   **Michael Donor:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are nucleophilic at the α-carbon and are used in Stork enamine synthesis, a variation of the Michael reaction.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n*   **Reaction:** The nucleophilic α-carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. The acidic workup (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the intermediate iminium salt back into a ketone.\n*   **Product (B):** The final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the α-position (carbon 2) with the remnant of the nitrile. The structure is named with the nitrile as the principal functional group: **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n**Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** But-3-en-2-one, commonly known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK).\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. The \"3-oxobutyl\" group (`-CH₂CH₂COCH₃`) comes from the MVK acceptor.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a reverse analysis of a Michael addition. The product shows that the 3-oxobutyl group has been added to the C2 position of a cyclohexane-1,3-dione. For this to happen, the starting material C must have been the Michael donor.\n*   **Reactant (C):** The proton at the C2 position of **cyclohexane-1,3-dione** is highly acidic because it is situated between two carbonyl groups. The base (KOH) removes this proton to form a nucleophilic enolate, which then attacks the MVK.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct combination is:\n*   **A:** trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B:** 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C:** cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
