    "The multi-step synthesis problem can be solved by carefully analyzing each reaction and predicting the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reactants:** 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene is combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide.\n*   **In situ Diene Formation:** The reaction of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene with sodium iodide is a known method to generate the highly reactive diene, 5,6-dimethylenecyclohexa-1,3-diene. This species is an isomer of o-xylene and is a potent diene in Diels-Alder reactions.\n*   **Reaction:** The generated diene undergoes a double Diels-Alder cycloaddition with the two double bonds of the 7-(tert-butoxy)norbornadiene. This forms a complex polycyclic molecule, **Product 1**.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid.\n*   **Transformation:** The strong acid catalyzes the removal of the tert-butyl protecting group from the oxygen atom, converting the tert-butoxy ether into a hydroxyl group (-OH). This reaction proceeds via the formation of a stable tert-butyl cation, which is eliminated as isobutylene. The resulting alcohol is **Product 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO.\n*   **Transformation:** This set of reagents corresponds to the Parikh-Doering oxidation, a mild method for oxidizing secondary alcohols to ketones. The hydroxyl group at the bridge position of the norbornane framework is oxidized to a carbonyl group (C=O). The resulting ketone is **Product 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 is heated to 150Â°C.\n*   **Transformation:** Product 3 is a double Diels-Alder adduct built upon a 7-ketonorbornadiene core. Such structures are known to undergo a thermal retro-Diels-Alder reaction upon heating. This process is reversible, but one of the fragments, 7-ketobicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene, is unstable at this temperature and irreversibly decomposes by extruding carbon monoxide (CO) to form the very stable aromatic molecule, benzene.\n*   **Final Products:** The overall fragmentation yields benzene, carbon monoxide, and two molecules of the diene that was generated in the first step: 5,6-dimethylenecyclohexa-1,3-diene. The question asks for the analysis of \"final product 4,\" which refers to this diene.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4**\n\nThe final product to be analyzed is **5,6-dimethylenecyclohexa-1,3-diene**. To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must consider its symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:** The molecule consists of a six-membered ring with conjugated double bonds at the C1-C2 and C3-C4 positions, and exocyclic double bonds (=CH2) at the C5 and C6 positions.\n*   **Symmetry:** While the cyclohexadiene ring is not perfectly planar, it undergoes rapid ring-flipping at room temperature. On the NMR timescale, the molecule has an effective C2 symmetry. The C2 axis passes through the midpoints of the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n*   **Chemically Distinct Hydrogens:** Due to this C2 symmetry:\n    1.  The hydrogen atoms on C1 and C4 are equivalent.\n    2.  The hydrogen atoms on C2 and C3 are equivalent.\n    3.  The two exocyclic methylene groups (=CH2) at C5 and C6 are equivalent. However, within each methylene group, the two hydrogen atoms are diastereotopic because of the chiral, non-planar nature of the ring. One hydrogen points \"inward\" towards the ring, and the other points \"outward.\" The two \"inward\" hydrogens are equivalent to each other by the C2 rotation, and the two \"outward\" hydrogens are also equivalent to each other.\n\nThis results in four distinct sets of hydrogen atoms:\n1.  The pair of hydrogens at C1 and C4.\n2.  The pair of hydrogens at C2 and C3.\n3.  The pair of \"inward\" hydrogens on the methylene groups.\n4.  The pair of \"outward\" hydrogens on the methylene groups.\n\nTherefore, there are 4 chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms in product 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
