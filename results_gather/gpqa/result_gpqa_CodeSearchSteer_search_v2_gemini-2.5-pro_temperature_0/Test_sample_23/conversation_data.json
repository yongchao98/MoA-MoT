    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance Z**\nSubstance Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. The general formula for a hydrocarbon is CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by `(y * 1.008) / (x * 12.011 + y * 1.008)`. Using the approximate atomic masses (H=1, C=12), this simplifies to `y / (12x + y)`.\nSetting this equal to 14.28%, which is approximately 1/7:\n`y / (12x + y) = 1/7`\n`7y = 12x + y`\n`6y = 12x`\n`y = 2x`\nThis corresponds to the general formula CnH2n, which is characteristic of cycloalkanes or alkenes. Since Z is formed by hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen, it must be a saturated compound, which rules out alkenes. Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane. The problem states that Z is widely used as a solvent. Cyclohexane (C6H12) is a very common cycloalkane solvent. For C6H12, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `12 / (6*12 + 12) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%`. This confirms that Z is very likely cyclohexane.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Mixture Y**\nMixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic. One of the components of Y is Z (cyclohexane, C6H12). Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions yields only Z (cyclohexane). This implies that the other component of Y must also convert to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation. A very common compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane is benzene (C6H6). Benzene does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions because doing so would disrupt its stable aromatic system. Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reaction from X to Y**\nMixture X, an equimolar mixture of two liquids (let's call them X1 and X2), is heated with platinum to form mixture Y. This is described as a disproportionation reaction. In this context, it is a hydrogen transfer reaction where one component is hydrogenated and the other is dehydrogenated.\nThe overall reaction is:\n`X1 + X2 → C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)`\nSince the starting mixture X and the resulting mixture Y are both equimolar, the stoichiometry is 1:1 for all components.\n\n**Step 4: Identify Mixture X and Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms**\nLet the molecular formula of X1 be C6Ha and X2 be C6Hb. The carbon skeleton must be C6 because hydrogenation of both components yields cyclohexane.\nFrom the balanced reaction in Step 3, we can balance the hydrogen atoms:\n`a + b = 12 + 6`\n`a + b = 18`\nThis means the total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of X1 and one molecule of X2 is 18.\n\nTo verify this, we can identify plausible structures for X1 and X2:\n*   They must decolorize bromine water, so they are unsaturated (contain C=C bonds).\n*   They must not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   Hydrogenation of each must yield cyclohexane.\n\nA logical choice for X1 and X2 that fits these criteria is cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n*   **Cyclohexene (C6H10):** Has one double bond, so it decolorizes bromine water. It is not conjugated. Hydrogenation gives cyclohexane.\n*   **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8):** Has two double bonds which are isolated (not conjugated), so it decolorizes bromine water. Hydrogenation gives cyclohexane.\n\nThe sum of their hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. The reaction would be a hydrogen transfer where 1,4-cyclohexadiene is dehydrogenated to benzene, and cyclohexene is hydrogenated to cyclohexane. This type of disproportionation is known to occur over platinum catalysts.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\nTotal H atoms = (H in X1) + (H in X2) = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<A>>>"
