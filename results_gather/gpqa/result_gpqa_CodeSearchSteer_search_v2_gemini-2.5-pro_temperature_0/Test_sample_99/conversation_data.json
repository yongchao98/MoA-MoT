    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final products and evaluate the given statements.\n\n*   **Step 1: Compound A to Compound B**\n    Compound A has the formula C3H6, which corresponds to propene (CH3-CH=CH2). When propene undergoes bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), an electrophilic addition reaction occurs across the double bond. This reaction yields 1,2-dibromopropane.\n    *   **A**: Propene (C3H6)\n    *   **B**: 1,2-dibromopropane (CH3CHBrCH2Br)\n\n*   **Step 2: Compound B to Compound C**\n    Compound B (1,2-dibromopropane) reacts with alcoholic potassium hydroxide (KOH). This is a strong base that causes double dehydrohalogenation (elimination of two molecules of HBr) to form an alkyne. The product is propyne.\n    *   **C**: Propyne (CH3C≡CH)\n\n*   **Step 3: Compound C to Compound D**\n    When propyne (Compound C) is passed through a red-hot iron tube, it undergoes cyclic polymerization (trimerization). Three molecules of propyne combine to form 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, also known as mesitylene.\n    *   **D**: 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (Mesitylene)\n\n*   **Step 4: Compound D to Compound E**\n    Compound D (mesitylene) reacts with a mixture of two strong acids, typically concentrated nitric acid (HNO3) and concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4). This is a nitration reaction. The three methyl groups on the benzene ring direct the incoming nitro group to one of the available ortho/para positions, resulting in nitromesitylene.\n    *   **E**: 2,4,6-trimethylnitrobenzene\n\n*   **Step 5: Compound E to Compound F**\n    Compound E (nitromesitylene) is treated with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid (Fe/HCl). This is a standard method for the reduction of a nitro group (-NO2) to an amino group (-NH2). The product is 2,4,6-trimethylaniline.\n    *   **F**: 2,4,6-trimethylaniline (Mesitylamine)\n\n*   **Step 6: Compound F to Compound G**\n    Compound F (2,4,6-trimethylaniline) reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2), usually generated in situ from NaNO2 and HCl at low temperatures. This is a diazotization reaction that converts the primary aromatic amine into a diazonium salt.\n    *   **G**: 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt\n\n*   **Step 7: Compound G to Compound H**\n    The diazonium salt (Compound G) reacts with sodium hydroxide (NaOH). In an aqueous basic solution, especially with warming, the diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH), forming a phenol.\n    *   **H**: 2,4,6-trimethylphenol (Mesitylol)\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n**A) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\nCompound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene). Due to the molecule's high symmetry, the nine protons of the three methyl groups are chemically equivalent and produce a single signal (a singlet). The three protons on the aromatic ring are also chemically equivalent and produce another singlet. Therefore, the 1H NMR spectrum of mesitylene shows two singlets. This statement is **correct**.\n\n**B) C is a flammable gas.**\nCompound C is propyne. Propyne is a colorless gas at room temperature (boiling point -23.1 °C) and is known to be highly flammable. This statement is **correct**.\n\n**C) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\nCompound F is 2,4,6-trimethylaniline. Aromatic amines are widely used as precursors in the synthesis of various dyes, including azo dyes. Specifically, 2,4,6-trimethylaniline is used to produce dyes like Acid Blue 129. This statement is **correct**.\n\n**D) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\nCompound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is a characteristic test for phenols, which typically produces a distinct violet, blue, green, or purple color upon reaction with a neutral ferric chloride solution. A yellow color is the color of the ferric chloride solution itself and generally indicates a negative or non-characteristic reaction, not a positive test. While some sterically hindered phenols may give an atypical result, the claim of a specific yellow color as a positive test is incorrect for a typical phenol. This statement is **incorrect**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
