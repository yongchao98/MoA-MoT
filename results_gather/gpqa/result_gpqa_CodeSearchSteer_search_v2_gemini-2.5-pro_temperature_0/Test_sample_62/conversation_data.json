    "To determine the momentum of the absorbed photon, we must first calculate the energy of the transition. The molecule is described by the quantum rotation-vibration model, where the energy of a state is the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies.\n\nThe energy for a given state, defined by the vibrational quantum number `v` and the rotational quantum number `J`, is:\n`E(v, J) = ħω(v + 1/2) + (ħ² / 2I) * J(J + 1)`\n\nWhere:\n*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (`1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s`)\n*   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration (`4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s`)\n*   `I` is the moment of inertia of the molecule\n*   `v` is the vibrational quantum number (`0, 1, 2, ...`)\n*   `J` is the rotational quantum number (`0, 1, 2, ...`)\n\nThe molecule starts in its fundamental (ground) state, which is the lowest possible energy state. This corresponds to `v = 0` and `J = 0`.\n`E_ground = E(0, 0) = ħω(0 + 1/2) + 0 = (1/2)ħω`\n\nThe question asks for the transition to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy.\" In the context of rovibrational spectroscopy, this refers to a transition where the molecule absorbs a photon, increasing its energy. The selection rules for such an absorption are `Δv = +1` and `ΔJ = +1`. Starting from the ground state (`v=0, J=0`), the only allowed transition is to the state `v=1, J=1`.\n\nThe energy of this excited state is:\n`E_excited = E(1, 1) = ħω(1 + 1/2) + (ħ² / 2I) * 1(1 + 1) = (3/2)ħω + ħ²/I`\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon (`ΔE`) must be equal to the difference between these two energy levels:\n`ΔE = E_excited - E_ground = [(3/2)ħω + ħ²/I] - (1/2)ħω = ħω + ħ²/I`\n\nTo calculate this energy, we first need the moment of inertia (`I`), which is given by `I = μR²`, where `μ` is the reduced mass and `R` is the bond length.\n\n1.  **Calculate the reduced mass (μ):**\n    *   `Mx = 20 amu`\n    *   `My = 2 amu`\n    *   `1 amu = 1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg`\n    *   `μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 amu ≈ 1.8182 amu`\n    *   `μ ≈ 1.8182 * (1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) ≈ 3.0192 x 10⁻²⁷ kg`\n\n2.  **Calculate the moment of inertia (I):**\n    *   `R = 2 angstroms = 2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m`\n    *   `I = μR² ≈ (3.0192 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)² = 1.2077 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²`\n\n3.  **Calculate the two components of the transition energy:**\n    *   Vibrational part: `ħω = (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s) ≈ 4.2183 x 10⁻²⁰ J`\n    *   Rotational part: `ħ²/I = (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (1.2077 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²) ≈ 9.208 x 10⁻²³ J`\n\n4.  **Calculate the total transition energy (ΔE):**\n    *   `ΔE = (4.2183 x 10⁻²⁰ J) + (0.009208 x 10⁻²⁰ J) ≈ 4.2275 x 10⁻²⁰ J`\n\nFinally, the momentum of a photon (`p`) is related to its energy by the equation `p = E / c`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the photon's momentum (p):**\n    *   `c` (speed of light) `≈ 2.9979 x 10⁸ m/s`\n    *   `p = ΔE / c ≈ (4.2275 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (2.9979 x 10⁸ m/s) ≈ 1.410 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s`\n\nThis calculated value is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
