    "Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism where isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other (enantiomers) or are diastereomers that are also chiral. A key feature for many optically active molecules is the presence of a chiral center or an axis of chirality.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. Biphenyls can exhibit a type of optical isomerism called atropisomerism when there is restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restriction is caused by bulky groups at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6'). In this specific molecule, the ortho positions are substituted with large nitro (-NO2) and dimethyl carboxylate (-COOCH3) groups. These bulky groups prevent the two rings from becoming coplanar, leading to a twisted, stable conformation. This creates a chiral axis along the C1-C1' bond, making the molecule and its mirror image non-superimposable. Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule contains a central carbon atom (C2) bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four different substituents is a chiral center. The presence of this single chiral center makes the molecule chiral and thus optically active, existing as two enantiomers (D and L forms).\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The central carbon atom in benzophenone is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two identical phenyl groups. To be a chiral center, a carbon must be bonded to four *different* groups. Since it is only bonded to three groups (one oxygen and two phenyls) and the two phenyl groups are identical, it does not have a chiral center. The molecule itself is achiral and therefore does not exhibit optical isomerism. While individual molecules can be twisted in a crystal lattice to form a chiral crystal, the molecule itself in a non-crystalline state is not chiral.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This molecule is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid dimethyl ester. It has a double bond which prevents free rotation, leading to geometric isomerism (cis/trans). However, the molecule is symmetrical. It possesses a center of inversion and a plane of symmetry, which means it is achiral and cannot be optically active. Its stereoisomer, dimethyl maleate (the *cis*-isomer), is also achiral.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate (1) and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (2) show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<C>>>"
