    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax, assuming a uniform distribution of stars.\n\n1.  **Uniform Star Distribution**: The initial assumption is that stars are distributed uniformly throughout space. This means the number of stars per unit volume, known as the number density (ρ), is constant.\n\n2.  **Number of Stars and Distance**: The total number of stars (N) within a spherical volume of radius (d) is the product of the number density and the volume of the sphere.\n    *   Volume of a sphere: V = (4/3)πd³\n    *   Total number of stars within distance d: N = ρ * V = (4/3)πρd³\n\n3.  **Relating Distance to Parallax**: Stellar parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance (d) to a star. The relationship is given by:\n    *   d = 1/plx\n    (This is a simplified formula where d is in parsecs and plx is in arcseconds).\n\n4.  **Number of Stars and Parallax**: We can substitute the distance-parallax relationship into the equation for the number of stars. This gives us the total number of stars (N) with a parallax *greater than or equal to* a certain value `plx` (since a smaller distance corresponds to a larger parallax).\n    *   N(plx) = (4/3)πρ * (1/plx)³ = (4/3)πρ * plx⁻³\n\n5.  **Number of Stars per Unit Parallax**: The question asks for how the number of stars *per unit range of parallax* changes with parallax. This quantity is the derivative of the total number of stars with respect to parallax, dN/d(plx). This tells us the density of stars in \"parallax space.\"\n    *   dN/d(plx) = d/d(plx) [ (4/3)πρ * plx⁻³ ]\n\n6.  **Differentiation**: Using the power rule for differentiation, we find:\n    *   dN/d(plx) = (4/3)πρ * (-3 * plx⁻⁴)\n    *   dN/d(plx) = -4πρ * plx⁻⁴\n\n7.  **Interpretation**: The magnitude of the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to plx⁻⁴, or 1/plx⁴. The negative sign simply indicates that the cumulative number of stars decreases as the parallax value increases (since we are looking at progressively smaller volumes of space). The key relationship for the distribution density is the proportionality. A Wikipedia article on the Lutz-Kelker bias confirms that for a uniform stellar distribution, the probability density of the true parallax per unit range of parallax is proportional to 1/p⁴, where p is the true parallax.\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx as ~ 1/plx⁴.\n\n<<<D>>>"
