    "To eliminate an anti-nutritional compound, the goal is to disrupt the function of the protein synthesized from the responsible gene. This is most effectively achieved by a mutation that causes a significant alteration to the protein's structure. Let's analyze the impact of each mutation by examining how it changes the sequence of amino acids, a process called translation.\n\nThe genetic code is read in groups of three bases called codons, with each codon specifying a particular amino acid. The process starts at the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT ... -3’`\n    *   `ATG` codes for Methionine (Start).\n    *   `TTT` codes for Phenylalanine.\n    *   `CTC` codes for Leucine.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT ... -3’`\n    *   The change from `TTT` to `TTC` is a **silent mutation** because both codons specify the amino acid Phenylalanine.\n    *   The change from `CTC` to `TAC` is a **missense mutation**, as it substitutes Leucine with Tyrosine. This changes one amino acid, which might alter the protein's function, but it is not guaranteed to eliminate it completely.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT ... -3’`\n    *   The change from `TTT` to `TTC` is a silent mutation (Phenylalanine).\n    *   The change from `CTC` to `TAA` is a **nonsense mutation**. The `TAA` codon is a stop codon, which signals the cell to terminate protein synthesis prematurely. This results in a severely shortened and almost certainly non-functional protein. This type of mutation is highly likely to eliminate the protein's function.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT ... -3’`\n    *   This sequence contains two **missense mutations**: `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), and `ACT` (Threonine) is changed to `GTC` (Valine). While multiple amino acid changes increase the chance of disrupting the protein, it is less certain than a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT ... -3’`\n    *   This sequence also has two **missense mutations**: `CTC` (Leucine) becomes `TAC` (Tyrosine), and `GGT` (Glycine) becomes `ACT` (Threonine). Similar to Mutant 3, this may or may not eliminate the protein's function.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nMutant 2 is the most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound because the introduction of a premature stop codon (a nonsense mutation) early in the gene sequence will halt protein production, leading to a truncated and non-functional protein.\n\n<<<B>>>"
