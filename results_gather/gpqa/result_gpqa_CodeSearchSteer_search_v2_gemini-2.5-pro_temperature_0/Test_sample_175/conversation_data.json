    "To determine the probability of sequentially measuring two observables, we must follow the principles of quantum mechanics, including state normalization, eigenvalue calculation, the Born rule for probabilities, and the collapse of the state vector upon measurement.\n\nHere is a step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Normalize the Initial State**: The initial state of the system is given by the column matrix `|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]`. First, we need to normalize this state. The squared norm is `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`. The normalized state `|ψ_norm⟩` is `(1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]`.\n\n2.  **Find the Eigenvalues and Eigenvector for Operator P**: The operator P is given by the matrix:\n    `P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n    We need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the measurement outcome of 0. The eigenvalues (λ) are found by solving the characteristic equation `det(P - λI) = 0`, which yields `λ(-λ² + 1) = 0`. The eigenvalues are λ = 0, 1, and -1.\n\n    For the eigenvalue λ = 0, the eigenvector `|p_0⟩` is found by solving `P|p_0⟩ = 0`. This gives the equations `(1/√2)y = 0` and `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0`, which simplifies to `y = 0` and `x = -z`. The unnormalized eigenvector is `[1, 0, -1]`. Normalizing this gives `|p_0⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Probability of Measuring P = 0**: The probability of measuring an eigenvalue is the squared magnitude of the inner product of the corresponding eigenvector and the system's state vector.\n    `Prob(P=0) = |⟨p_0|ψ_norm⟩|²`\n    `⟨p_0|ψ_norm⟩ = [(1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]]† * [(1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]]`\n    `= (1/√12) * (1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1) = -2/√12 = -1/√3`\n    `Prob(P=0) = (-1/√3)² = 1/3`.\n\n4.  **State Collapse after Measuring P**: After measuring P and obtaining the value 0, the state of the system collapses to the corresponding eigenvector `|p_0⟩`. The new state of the system is `|ψ'⟩ = |p_0⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]`.\n\n5.  **Find the Eigenvector for Operator Q**: The operator Q is given by the matrix:\n    `Q = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]]`\n    This is a diagonal matrix, so its eigenvalues are the diagonal elements: 1, 0, and -1. We are interested in the outcome Q = -1. The corresponding eigenvector `|q_{-1}⟩` is `[0, 0, 1]`, which is already normalized.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Probability of Measuring Q = -1**: Now, we calculate the probability of measuring Q = -1 from the collapsed state `|ψ'⟩`.\n    `Prob(Q=-1 | P=0) = |⟨q_{-1}|ψ'⟩|²`\n    `⟨q_{-1}|ψ'⟩ = [0, 0, 1]† * [(1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]]`\n    `= (1/√2) * (0*1 + 0*0 + 1*(-1)) = -1/√2`\n    `Prob(Q=-1 | P=0) = (-1/√2)² = 1/2`.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Total Probability**: The probability of a sequence of measurements is the product of the individual probabilities.\n    `Prob(P=0 and then Q=-1) = Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1 | P=0)`\n    `= (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6`.\n\nTherefore, the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements is 1/6.\n\n<<<A>>>"
