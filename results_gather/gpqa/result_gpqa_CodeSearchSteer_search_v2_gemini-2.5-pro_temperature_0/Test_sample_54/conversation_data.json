    "Based on the detailed analysis of the provided 1H NMR data, the unknown compound is identified as **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n### **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n\n1.  **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, singlet):** This signal is characteristic of the three equivalent protons of an acetate methyl group (CH₃-C=O). The singlet multiplicity indicates no adjacent protons to cause splitting. This is consistent with all the proposed acetate compounds.\n\n2.  **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, doublet, J = 16.0 Hz):** This signal is in the alkene region, indicating a proton on a carbon-carbon double bond. The large coupling constant (J) of 16.0 Hz is a key piece of information. Coupling constants for vinylic protons are typically in the range of 11-18 Hz for a *trans* configuration and 6-15 Hz for a *cis* configuration. The observed value of 16.0 Hz strongly indicates that the two protons on the double bond are in a *trans* arrangement. This eliminates the *cis* isomers, Cis-propenyl acetate and Cis-butenyl acetate.\n\n3.  **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, doublet of quartets):** This signal, also in the alkene region, corresponds to the second proton on the double bond. The \"doublet of quartets\" (dq) splitting pattern means this proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons. The doublet arises from coupling to the other single proton across the double bond (the one at 7.0 ppm). The quartet (a 1:3:3:1 pattern) arises from coupling to a neighboring methyl (CH₃) group.\n\n4.  **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, doublet):** This signal represents a methyl group (3H) that is adjacent to a single proton, causing its signal to be split into a doublet. This corresponds to the methyl group attached to the double bond (C=C-CH₃).\n\n### **Structure Determination:**\n\nPutting the pieces together:\n*   The acetate group is confirmed by the singlet at 2.1 ppm.\n*   The *trans*-alkene is confirmed by the J value of 16.0 Hz.\n*   The structure must contain a `CH-CH` group (the two alkene protons) where one of the carbons is also attached to a methyl group (`CH-CH₃`).\n\nThis perfectly matches the structure of **Trans-propenyl acetate** (systematically named trans-prop-1-en-1-yl acetate):\n\n*   **CH₃ (acetate):** 2.1 ppm (s)\n*   **-O-CH=:** 7.0 ppm (d)\n*   **=CH-CH₃:** 5.5 ppm (dq)\n*   **=CH-CH₃:** 1.6 ppm (d)\n\nThe alternative, Trans-butenyl acetate (specifically trans-but-2-enyl acetate or crotyl acetate), has the structure CH₃-CH=CH-CH₂-O-C(=O)-CH₃. This structure would show a signal for the -CH₂-O- protons (around 4.5 ppm) and would not have a proton with a doublet of quartets splitting pattern, which contradicts the provided data.\n\nTherefore, the data unequivocally points to Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<B>>>"
