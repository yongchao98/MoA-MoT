    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Structural Information:** The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we start with a C₆H₄ group.\n\n2.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:** The spectrum indicates the presence of an ester group (-COO-). This accounts for the two oxygen atoms in the chemical formula.\n\n3.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:** This provides the most detailed clues about the attached groups.\n    *   **No –CH₂ groups:** This is a critical constraint, eliminating any structures with ethyl, propyl, or other similar alkyl chains.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH₃ groups:** This means there are two distinct methyl groups in the molecule.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH₃).\n        *   The proton on the middle carbon is split by the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and by the three protons of the methyl group (creating a quartet), resulting in a **doublet of quartets**.\n        *   The proton on the terminal carbon (attached to the ring) is split only by the adjacent vinyl proton, resulting in a **doublet**.\n        *   This confirms one of the substituents is a propenyl group (–C₃H₅), which also accounts for one of the two –CH₃ signals.\n    *   **Assembling the second substituent:** We still need to place the ester group (–COO–) and the second –CH₃ group. The only way to do this without creating a –CH₂– group is to form a methyl ester (–COOCH₃). This accounts for the second –CH₃ signal.\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** A di-substituted benzene ring with two different groups, such as a propenyl group and a methyl ester group, would show distinct signals for the aromatic protons, consistent with the \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\" description (likely an AA'BB' system if para-substituted).\n\n4.  **Construct the Molecule and Determine the Formula:**\n    *   We have a benzene ring: C₆H₄\n    *   We have a propenyl group: –CH=CH–CH₃ (which is C₃H₅)\n    *   We have a methyl ester group: –COOCH₃ (which is C₂H₃O₂)\n\n    Now, let's add up the atoms:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from methyl ester) = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from methyl ester) = **12**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** **2** (from ester)\n\n    The resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n5.  **Verify with Other Options:**\n    *   **C₁₁H₁₄O₂:** This would require saturating the double bond of the propenyl group to a propyl group (–CH₂CH₂CH₃), which would introduce –CH₂– signals, contradicting the NMR data.\n    *   **C₁₂H₁₂O₂ and C₁₂H₁₄O₂:** Adding another carbon or a carbon and two hydrogens without introducing a –CH₂– group and while keeping the other NMR-defined fragments is not feasible. For instance, adding a CH₂ group is explicitly ruled out.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the spectroscopic data, the only possible formula is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<C>>>"
