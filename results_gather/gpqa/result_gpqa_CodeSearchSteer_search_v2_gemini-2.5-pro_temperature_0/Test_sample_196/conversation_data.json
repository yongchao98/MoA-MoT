    "### Analysis of Compound X\n\nFirst, the structure of the starting material, Compound X, is determined from the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   A very broad absorption in the range of 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   Absorptions at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ are indicative of C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n\n*   **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   A broad singlet at 10.5 ppm, integrating to one proton, is a classic signal for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n    *   Two doublets at 8.0 ppm (2H) and 7.2 ppm (2H) suggest a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The downfield shift of the doublet at 8.0 ppm indicates it is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group.\n    *   The remaining signals describe an alkyl substituent:\n        *   A multiplet at 2.9 ppm (1H) is a methine (-CH) group.\n        *   A multiplet at 1.7 ppm (2H) corresponds to a methylene (-CH₂) group.\n        *   A doublet at 1.4 ppm (3H) is a methyl (-CH₃) group adjacent to a methine.\n        *   A triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) is a methyl (-CH₃) group adjacent to a methylene.\n    *   Assembling this alkyl fragment gives a sec-butyl group, which is attached to the benzene ring.\n\nBased on the combined IR and NMR data, Compound X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI\n\nCompound X is treated with red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination of reagents is a powerful reducing agent. Specifically, it is known to completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). The reaction proceeds as follows:\n\nR-COOH + 6HI --(Red P)--> R-CH₃ + 3I₂ + 2H₂O\n\nThe red phosphorus serves to regenerate the HI by reacting with the iodine (I₂) formed during the reaction, thus allowing the reduction to go to completion.\n\n### Identification of the Final Product\n\nApplying this reduction to the starting material, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, the carboxylic acid group is converted into a methyl group, while the sec-butyl group and the benzene ring remain unchanged.\n\nTherefore, the final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n*   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is the starting material.\n*   B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid is an isomer of the starting material but does not match the spectral data or the reaction product.\n*   C) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene is the correct product of the reduction.\n*   D) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene has an incorrect alkyl substituent.\n\n<<<C>>>"
