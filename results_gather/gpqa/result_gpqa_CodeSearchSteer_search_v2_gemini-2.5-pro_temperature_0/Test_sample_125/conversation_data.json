    "Here is a detailed analysis of the reactions and the subsequent chromatographic separation:\n\n### **Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a chiral ketone. The stereocenter is at the C5 position.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a hydroxyl group.\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. Since the starting material is enantiomerically pure (S configuration at C5), the hydride attack on the two faces of the carbonyl group is not equally probable. This leads to the formation of two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two products are diastereomers of each other.\n\n### **Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. This results in the formation of three stereoisomers:\n    *   A pair of enantiomers: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   A meso compound: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, which is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of five different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Reaction I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Reaction I)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Reaction II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Reaction II)\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso, from Reaction II)\n\n### **Chromatographic Separation**\n\n**1. Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers**, having identical physical properties in an achiral environment, cannot be separated and will elute as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers**, having different physical properties, can be separated.\n\nLet's analyze the peaks:\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) will co-elute as **one peak**.\n*   The meso compound from Reaction II is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will be separated, resulting in another, separate **peak**.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C7 mono-ethers) and Reaction II (C5 diols) are structurally different molecules with different polarities, so they will be separated from each other.\n\nTherefore, the total number of peaks in the normal-phase HPLC will be 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**2. Chiral HPLC**\n\nA chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase that allows for the separation of enantiomers in addition to diastereomers. Each unique stereoisomer will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase and will, therefore, be separated.\n\nLet's analyze the peaks:\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated, giving **two peaks**.\n*   The three stereoisomers from Reaction II will all be separated: the (2R, 4R) enantiomer, the (2S, 4S) enantiomer, and the meso compound. This results in **three peaks**.\n\nTherefore, the total number of peaks in the chiral HPLC will be 2 (from Rxn I) + 3 (from Rxn II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
