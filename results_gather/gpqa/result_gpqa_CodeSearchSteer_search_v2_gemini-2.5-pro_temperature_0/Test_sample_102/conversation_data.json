    "An analysis of the target molecule, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, reveals a benzene ring with three substituents: an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2). These groups are in a 1,3,5-relationship, meaning they are all *meta* to each other. Achieving this substitution pattern requires a careful sequence of reactions that considers the directing effects of each group.\n\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl group):** A meta-director and deactivating.\n*   **-Br (bromo group):** An ortho, para-director and deactivating.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro group):** A meta-director and strongly deactivating.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n**A) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\nThis sequence begins with the nitration of benzene to form nitrobenzene, followed by reduction to aniline. Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3) on aniline. This reaction is not feasible because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, strongly deactivating the ring and preventing the desired acylation.\n\n**B) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n1.  **i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone:** This Friedel-Crafts acylation is a standard method to add the acetyl group to benzene.\n2.  **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone:** The acetyl group is a meta-director, so it directs the incoming bromine to the 3-position. This step correctly establishes the 1,3 relationship between the acetyl and bromo groups.\n3.  **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one:** In this step, the ring has two directing groups: the acetyl group at C1 (meta-director) and the bromo group at C3 (ortho, para-director). The acetyl group directs the new substituent to position 5. The bromo group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6. While the directing effects are in conflict, this is the most plausible pathway among the choices to form the 1,3,5-substituted product. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) appear to be extraneous if the target molecule is formed at this stage, suggesting a possible error in the question's formulation. However, the initial steps of this sequence are the most chemically sound for assembling the required structure.\n\n**C) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4**\nThis sequence is illogical. Steps (i) through (iv) (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) would convert benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, then to a diazonium salt, and finally back to benzene. This circular process makes the option nonsensical.\n\n**D) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) Fe/HCl ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\nThis sequence starts with bromination of benzene, followed by nitration. This would primarily yield p-bromonitrobenzene. Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on this molecule. The ring is strongly deactivated by both the nitro and bromo groups, causing the Friedel-Crafts acylation to fail.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOptions A, C, and D contain steps that are either chemically impossible (like the Friedel-Crafts reactions in A and D) or nonsensical (the circular sequence in C). Option B provides the most logical and viable route for the first two steps to create the 1,3-disubstituted intermediate. The third step, while having potential issues with regioselectivity, is the only plausible reaction presented in any option that could lead to the final 1,3,5-trisubstituted product. Therefore, it is the best choice among the given options.\n\n<<<B>>>"
