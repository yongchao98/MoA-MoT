    "### Analysis of the Reactions\n\n**Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\nThis reaction is a Michael addition. The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), is strong and sterically hindered. It will deprotonate the ketone at an α-carbon to form an enolate, which then acts as a nucleophile.\n\n1.  **Enolate Formation:** The ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, has two α-carbons, C2 and C6.\n    *   The C2 carbon is substituted with both an ethyl and a methyl group, meaning it has no α-protons and cannot be deprotonated.\n    *   The C6 carbon is substituted with a methyl group and has one α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation must occur at the C6 position, making the reaction highly regioselective. The resulting enolate will have a double bond between C1 and C6.\n\n2.  **Michael Addition:** The enolate attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n3.  **Product Structure:** The resulting product will have an ethyl propanoate group (`-CH₂CH₂COOEt`) attached to the C6 position of the original ketone. The full structure is 6-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n4.  **Product Naming:** To match the options provided, we name the product as a substituted ethyl propanoate.\n    *   The main chain is the ethyl propanoate.\n    *   The cyclohexyl ring is a substituent attached at position 3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   Numbering the cyclohexyl ring substituent, the point of attachment (the original C6) is designated as C1. The carbonyl group (the original C1) is at the adjacent position, C2. The original C2, bearing the ethyl and methyl groups, becomes C3.\n    *   Following this numbering, the substituent name is: (3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl).\n    *   Therefore, the full name for product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n**Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\nThis is also a Michael addition reaction. The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), deprotonates the α-carbon of the nitroalkane.\n\n1.  **Nitronate Formation:** The α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (the carbon bonded to the -NO₂ group) is acidic. KOH removes a proton to form a nucleophilic nitronate anion, `[CH₃CH₂CHNO₂]⁻`.\n\n2.  **Michael Addition:** The nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, `CH₃-CH=CH-CN`). The new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n\n3.  **Product Structure:** After the addition and subsequent protonation by water, the resulting structure is `NC-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(NO₂)-CH₂-CH₃`.\n\n4.  **Product Naming:** The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so the parent chain is named as a hexanenitrile.\n    *   Numbering starts from the carbon of the nitrile group as C1.\n    *   The chain is `NC(1)-C(2)H₂-C(3)H(CH₃)-C(4)H(NO₂)-C(5)H₂-C(6)H₃`.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   Thus, the name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
