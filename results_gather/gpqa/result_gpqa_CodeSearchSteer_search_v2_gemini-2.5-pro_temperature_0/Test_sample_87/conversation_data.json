    "The experiment described points to a specific process of the adaptive immune system occurring in the gut. Let's break down the evidence:\n\n*   **Antigen Delivery:** Rotavirus proteins are delivered orally, mimicking a natural infection route.\n*   **Antigen Location:** The fluorescent proteins are found in Peyer's patches, which are secondary lymphoid organs in the small intestine responsible for initiating immune responses to gut antigens.\n*   **Cellular Response:** A proliferating cell population is isolated. This indicates that immune cells, specifically lymphocytes, have recognized the antigen and have become activated.\n*   **Genetic Observation:** The key finding is \"high variability\" in the *variable heavy chain gene* of these proliferating cells. This points directly to B cells, as their immunoglobulin genes are the site of such changes.\n\nNow let's evaluate the options based on this evidence:\n\n*   **A) Complement activation:** This is a component of the innate immune system and does not involve generating variability in immunoglobulin genes.\n*   **B) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a process that occurs in activated, proliferating B cells within specialized structures called germinal centers, which are found in secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer's patches. SHM introduces a high rate of point mutations specifically into the variable regions of immunoglobulin genes. The purpose is to create variant antibodies, some of which will have a higher affinity for the antigen, leading to a more effective immune response. This perfectly matches the observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating cells in the Peyer's patch after antigen exposure.\n*   **C) V(D)J recombination:** This process creates the initial diversity of B cell receptors, but it happens in the bone marrow during B cell development, *before* they encounter an antigen. The experiment describes a process happening *after* antigen encounter in a secondary lymphoid organ.\n*   **D) Class switch recombination (CSR):** This process also occurs in activated B cells in germinal centers, often at the same time as SHM. However, CSR changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain, which alters the antibody's function (e.g., switching from IgM to IgA), but it does not affect the *variable* region responsible for antigen binding and variability. The question specifically notes variability in the *variable* gene.\n\nTherefore, the high variability observed in the variable heavy chain gene is the result of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
