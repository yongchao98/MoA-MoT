    "The reaction in question is a-sigmatropic rearrangement, specifically an aza-Cope rearrangement. The reactant, (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene, contains the necessary 1,5-diene system required for this transformation. The atoms involved are the vinyl group attached to the nitrogen and the double bond within the bicyclic ring system.\n\nThe mechanism proceeds as follows:\n1.  The molecule adopts a chair-like transition state.\n2.  The sigma bond between the nitrogen (N2) and the bridgehead carbon (C1) breaks.\n3.  A new sigma bond forms between the terminal carbon of the vinyl group and the C5 carbon of the bicyclic ring.\n4.  The double bonds shift: the vinyl double bond moves to form an imine (C=N), and the ring double bond moves to a new position.\n\nThis rearrangement results in the formation of a new bicyclic system composed of a six-membered ring fused to a five-membered ring. The product formed is a derivative of cyclopenta[c]pyridine. Through detailed mechanistic analysis and comparison with established chemical literature, the specific product is identified. The initial kinetic product of the rearrangement contains a double bond at a bridgehead position, which is generally unstable (a violation of Bredt's rule). This product rapidly tautomerizes (isomerizes) to a more stable thermodynamic product.\n\nThe final, stable product is **4,4a,5,7a-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine**. This corresponds to the structure where the saturated positions are at carbons 3, 4, 4a, 5, and 7a, which dictates the placement of the double bonds in the rest of the fused ring system.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\nA) 4,6,7,7a-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine\nB) 4,4a,5,6-tetrahydro-1H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine\nC) 4,4a,5,7a-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine\nD) 4,4a,7,7a-tetrahydro-1H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine\n\nThe correct product is given in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
