    "To determine the time it will take for the 22-year-old astronaut to reach Earth, we must first establish the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and then apply the principles of time dilation from Einstein's theory of special relativity.\n\n### Distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud\n\nThe Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite dwarf galaxy of the Milky Way. Its distance from Earth has been measured with increasing accuracy over the years. A precise measurement published in 2013, using observations of rare eclipsing binary stars, places the distance at approximately 163,000 light-years. Other sources mention distances ranging from 160,000 to 179,000 light-years. For our calculation, we will use the widely cited figure of 163,000 light-years.\n\n### Time Dilation Calculation\n\nThe phenomenon of time dilation dictates that a clock in motion relative to an observer will be measured to tick slower than a clock at rest. The time experienced by the astronaut (proper time, Δt₀) is related to the time observed from Earth (observer time, Δt) by the time dilation formula:\n\nΔt₀ = Δt * √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nWhere:\n*   **Δt₀** is the time experienced by the astronaut.\n*   **Δt** is the time measured by an observer on Earth.\n*   **v** is the velocity of the spacecraft (0.99999987 * c).\n*   **c** is the speed of light.\n\n**1. Calculate the time from Earth's perspective (Δt):**\n\nFirst, we calculate how long the journey takes from the viewpoint of an observer on Earth.\n\n*   Distance = 163,000 light-years\n*   Velocity (v) = 0.99999987 * c\n\nΔt = Distance / Velocity\nΔt = 163,000 light-years / (0.99999987 * c)\nSince one light-year is the distance light travels in one year, this simplifies to:\nΔt ≈ 163,000.02 years\n\nFrom Earth, the journey would appear to take just over 163,000 years.\n\n**2. Calculate the time from the astronaut's perspective (Δt₀):**\n\nNext, we calculate the time that passes for the astronaut on the spacecraft.\n\n*   v/c = 0.99999987\n*   v²/c² = (0.99999987)² ≈ 0.99999974\n*   1 - v²/c² ≈ 0.00000026\n*   √(1 - v²/c²) ≈ 0.0005099\n\nNow, we can find the astronaut's time:\nΔt₀ = 163,000.02 years * 0.0005099\nΔt₀ ≈ 83.11 years\n\nThe journey will take approximately 83.11 years from the astronaut's point of view.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe astronaut will age about 83 years during the trip. Since the astronaut is 22 years old at the start, their age upon arrival at Earth would be approximately 22 + 83 = 105 years. This is well within the alien's average lifespan of 150 years, so the astronaut will survive the journey.\n\nComparing our calculated travel time of approximately 83 years to the given options:\nA) 81 years\nB) 72 years\nC) The astronaut will die before reaching to the Earth.\nD) 77 years\n\nThe calculated value of ~83 years is closest to 81 years. The minor difference can be attributed to using a slightly different distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud (for instance, a distance of about 158,000 light-years would yield a result of approximately 80.56 years). Given the options, 81 years is the most plausible answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
