    "The solution to this problem relies on two fundamental laws of stellar astrophysics: the Stefan-Boltzmann Law and Wien's Displacement Law.\n\nFirst, the luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law. This law relates luminosity to the star's radius (R) and its surface temperature (T). The formula is:\n\nL = 4πR²σT⁴\n\nHere, σ (sigma) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\nTo find the ratio of the luminosities of Star_1 (L₁) and Star_2 (L₂), we can set up the following equation:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n\nThe constants 4, π, and σ cancel out, simplifying the expression to:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\nThe problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2, so we know that R₁/R₂ = 1.5.\n\nNext, we need to determine the ratio of the temperatures (T₁/T₂). The problem provides a crucial piece of information: \"Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same.\" This refers to the peak wavelength (λ_max) of the star's emission.\n\nWien's Displacement Law states that the peak emission wavelength of a black body is inversely proportional to its absolute temperature (T). The formula is:\n\nλ_max = b / T\n\nwhere 'b' is Wien's displacement constant.\n\nSince the astronomers determined that the peak wavelengths (λ_max) are the same for both stars, it implies that their intrinsic surface temperatures are also the same. The mention of \"spectroscopy\" is key; this analytical method allows astronomers to determine a star's intrinsic properties by accounting for factors like the Doppler effect. Therefore, we can conclude that T₁ = T₂, which means T₁/T₂ = 1.\n\nThe information about the masses and radial velocities of the stars is extraneous to this specific calculation. The radial velocity would be used to correct for Doppler shift to find the intrinsic peak wavelength, but the problem implies this has already been done.\n\nNow, we can substitute the known ratios back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * (1)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * 1\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25\n\nThus, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of 2.25.\n\n<<<C>>>"
