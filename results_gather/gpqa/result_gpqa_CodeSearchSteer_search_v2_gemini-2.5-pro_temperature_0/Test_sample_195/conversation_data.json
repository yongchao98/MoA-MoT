    "To determine the maximum speed of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator, we can use the principle of conservation of energy. The total energy of the system, which is the sum of its relativistic energy and potential energy, must remain constant throughout its motion.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Define the total conserved energy:** The total energy (E_total) of the system is the sum of the relativistic energy (γmc²) and the potential energy (U(x)). The potential energy for a spring obeying Hooke's law is U(x) = ½kx².\n    E_total = γmc² + ½kx²\n    where:\n    *   `m` is the rest mass of the object.\n    *   `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   `k` is the spring constant.\n    *   `x` is the displacement from the equilibrium position.\n    *   `γ` is the Lorentz factor, given by γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²).\n\n2.  **Consider the state at maximum amplitude:** At the maximum amplitude, x = A, the mass is momentarily at rest. Therefore, its velocity `v` is 0. When v = 0, the Lorentz factor γ becomes 1.\n    The total energy at this point is:\n    E_total = (1)mc² + ½kA²\n\n3.  **Consider the state at maximum speed:** The mass reaches its maximum speed, v_max, when it passes through the equilibrium position, x = 0. At this point, the potential energy is zero.\n    The total energy at this point is:\n    E_total = γ_max * mc² + 0\n    where γ_max = 1 / √(1 - v_max²/c²).\n\n4.  **Apply the conservation of energy:** Since the total energy is conserved, we can equate the energy at the maximum amplitude with the energy at the equilibrium position.\n    mc² + ½kA² = γ_max * mc²\n\n5.  **Solve for γ_max:**\n    γ_max = (mc² + ½kA²) / (mc²)\n    γ_max = 1 + (kA² / 2mc²)\n\n6.  **Solve for v_max:** Now, substitute the definition of γ_max and solve for v_max.\n    1 / √(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 + (kA² / 2mc²)\n\n    Square both sides of the reciprocal equation:\n    1 - v_max²/c² = 1 / (1 + (kA² / 2mc²))²\n\n    Rearrange the equation to solve for v_max²/c²:\n    v_max²/c² = 1 - 1 / (1 + (kA² / 2mc²))²\n\n    Finally, take the square root and multiply by `c`:\n    v_max = c * √[1 - 1 / (1 + (kA² / 2mc²))²]\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
