    "To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, ⟨S_y⟩, for an electron in the spin state (3i, 4), we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Normalize the spin state vector.**\n    The given unnormalized spin state is a column vector:\n    |ψ⟩ = [ 3i ]\n          [ 4  ]\n\n    To normalize it, we first find the inner product ⟨ψ|ψ⟩. The corresponding bra vector ⟨ψ| is the conjugate transpose of |ψ⟩:\n    ⟨ψ| = [ -3i, 4 ]\n\n    The inner product is:\n    ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4) = -9(i²) + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25\n\n    The normalization constant is 1/√25 = 1/5. The normalized state |ψ_norm⟩ is:\n    |ψ_norm⟩ = (1/5) * [ 3i ]\n                      [ 4  ]\n\n2.  **Define the spin operator S_y.**\n    The spin operator S_y is related to the Pauli matrix σ_y by S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y. Given the matrix for σ_y:\n    σ_y = [ 0  -i ]\n          [ i   0 ]\n\n    The S_y operator is:\n    S_y = (ħ/2) * [ 0  -i ]\n                  [ i   0 ]\n\n3.  **Calculate the expectation value ⟨S_y⟩.**\n    The expectation value is calculated using the formula ⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨ψ_norm|S_y|ψ_norm⟩.\n\n    ⟨S_y⟩ = (1/5) * [ -3i, 4 ] * ( (ħ/2) * [ 0  -i ] ) * ( (1/5) * [ 3i ] )\n                                        [ i   0 ]           [ 4  ]\n\n    Let's combine the normalization constants:\n    ⟨S_y⟩ = (1/25) * (ħ/2) * [ -3i, 4 ] * [ 0  -i ] * [ 3i ]\n                                          [ i   0 ]   [ 4  ]\n\n    First, we multiply the matrix and the column vector:\n    [ 0  -i ] * [ 3i ] = [ (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) ] = [ -4i  ]\n    [ i   0 ]   [ 4  ]   [ (i)(3i) + (0)(4)  ]   [ 3i²  ] = [ -4i ]\n                                                              [ -3  ]\n\n    Now, we multiply the row vector by the resulting column vector:\n    [ -3i, 4 ] * [ -4i ] = (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3) = 12i² - 12 = -12 - 12 = -24\n                   [ -3  ]\n\n    Finally, we include the constants:\n    ⟨S_y⟩ = (1/25) * (ħ/2) * (-24)\n    ⟨S_y⟩ = -24ħ / 50\n    ⟨S_y⟩ = -12ħ / 25\n\nThe expectation value of the spin along the y-direction is -12ħ/25.\n\n<<<B>>>"
