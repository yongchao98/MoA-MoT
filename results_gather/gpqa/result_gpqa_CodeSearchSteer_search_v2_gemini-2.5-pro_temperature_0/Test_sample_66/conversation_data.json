    "In this problem, we are considering a system of two electrons in a p orbital, which means their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are \\(l_1 = 1\\) and \\(l_2 = 1\\). The system is in a coupled angular momentum state described by the ket \\(|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle\\). Here, \\(l=2\\) is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number, and \\(m=-1\\) is the total magnetic quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum.\n\nWe want to find the joint probability of measuring the z-components of the individual angular momenta, \\(L_{1z}\\) and \\(L_{2z}\\), and obtaining the eigenvalues of \\(-\\hbar\\) for both. An eigenvalue of \\(-\\hbar\\) for \\(L_z\\) corresponds to a magnetic quantum number \\(m_l = -1\\). Therefore, we are looking for the probability of finding the first electron in the state with \\(m_1 = -1\\) and the second electron in the state with \\(m_2 = -1\\).\n\nThe state of the system in the coupled basis, \\(|l, m\\rangle\\), can be expressed as a linear combination of the states in the uncoupled basis, \\(|l_1, m_1\\rangle |l_2, m_2\\rangle\\). The coefficients of this expansion are the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The relationship is given by:\n\\(|l, m\\rangle = \\sum_{m_1, m_2} \\langle l_1, m_1, l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle |l_1, m_1\\rangle |l_2, m_2\\rangle\\)\n\nA fundamental selection rule for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, \\(\\langle l_1, m_1, l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle\\), is that they are non-zero only if the magnetic quantum numbers satisfy the relation:\n\\(m = m_1 + m_2\\)\n\nIn our specific case, the initial state is \\(|l=2, m=-1\\rangle\\). The measurement outcome we are interested in is \\(m_1 = -1\\) and \\(m_2 = -1\\).\nLet's check if this outcome is possible by applying the selection rule:\n\\(m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2\\)\n\nThe total magnetic quantum number of the initial state is \\(m = -1\\). The sum of the magnetic quantum numbers of the desired measurement outcome is \\(m_1 + m_2 = -2\\).\nSince \\(m \\neq m_1 + m_2\\) (i.e., \\(-1 \\neq -2\\)), the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for this transition is zero:\n\\(\\langle 1, -1, 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle = 0\\)\n\nThe probability of a particular measurement outcome (\\(m_1, m_2\\)) is the square of the absolute value of the corresponding Clebsch-Gordan coefficient:\n\\(P(m_1, m_2) = |\\langle l_1, m_1, l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle|^2\\)\n\nFor the outcome \\(m_1 = -1\\) and \\(m_2 = -1\\), the probability is:\n\\(P(-1, -1) = |\\langle 1, -1, 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle|^2 = |0|^2 = 0\\)\n\nTherefore, the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both \\(L_{1z}\\) and \\(L_{2z}\\) as \\(-\\hbar\\) is 0. This measurement outcome is forbidden by the law of conservation of angular momentum.\n\n<<<A>>>"
