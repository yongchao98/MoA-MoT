    "To determine the minimum energy of the system, we must calculate the total electrostatic potential energy. The system consists of a central charge and 12 charges on the surface of a sphere. The total energy is the sum of two components: the interaction energy between the central charge and the 12 outer charges, and the interaction energy among the 12 outer charges themselves.\n\n### 1. Physical Constants\n\nFirst, we define the necessary physical constants:\n*   **Elementary charge (e):** The magnitude of the charge of a single proton or electron. Its value is exactly `1.602176634 × 10⁻¹⁹` Coulombs (C).\n*   **Coulomb's constant (k):** The proportionality constant in Coulomb's law. Its value is approximately `8.98755 × 10⁹ N⋅m²/C²`.\n\n### 2. System Configuration\n\nThe system is described as:\n*   13 identical particles, each with a charge `q = 2e`.\n*   One particle is fixed at a point P.\n*   The other 12 particles are constrained to a distance `R = 2 m` from P, meaning they lie on the surface of a sphere.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe total electrostatic potential energy `U` of a system of charges is the sum of the potential energies for all unique pairs of charges.\n\n**a) Interaction between the Central Charge and Outer Charges (`U_center_outer`)**\n\nThe potential energy between the central charge (`q`) and each of the 12 outer charges (also `q`) at a fixed distance `R` is:\n`U_pair = k * (q * q) / R = k * q² / R`\n\nSince there are 12 such pairs, this component of the energy is:\n`U_center_outer = 12 * (k * q² / R)`\n\n**b) Interaction Among the 12 Outer Charges (`U_outer_outer`)**\n\nTo achieve the minimum energy for the system, the 12 charges on the sphere must arrange themselves to minimize their mutual repulsion. This is a well-known problem in physics called the **Thomson problem**. For N=12 particles, the minimum energy configuration is achieved when the charges are located at the vertices of a regular icosahedron.\n\nThe potential energy of this configuration is the sum of the energies of all pairs of the 12 charges:\n`U_outer_outer = Σ (k * q² / r_ij)` where `r_ij` is the distance between charges `i` and `j`.\n\nThis sum can be expressed as `U_outer_outer = (k * q² / R) * S'_12`, where `S'_12` is a dimensionless constant representing the sum of inverse distances for an icosahedron of unit radius. The value of `S'_12` is derived from the geometry of the icosahedron and is calculated to be approximately 49.165.\n\n### 4. Total Minimum Energy\n\nThe total minimum energy of the system is the sum of these two components:\n`U_total = U_center_outer + U_outer_outer`\n`U_total = (12 * k * q² / R) + (k * q² / R) * S'_12`\n`U_total = (k * q² / R) * (12 + S'_12)`\n\nNow, we substitute the given values:\n*   `q = 2e = 2 * (1.602176634 × 10⁻¹⁹ C)`\n*   `R = 2 m`\n*   `k = 8.98755 × 10⁹ N⋅m²/C²`\n*   `S'_12 ≈ 49.165`\n\n`U_total = (k * (2e)² / R) * (12 + 49.165)`\n`U_total = (4 * k * e² / R) * (61.165)`\n\nPlugging in the values for the constants:\n`U_total = (4 * (8.98755 × 10⁹) * (1.602176634 × 10⁻¹⁹)² / 2) * (61.165)`\n`U_total ≈ (4.614 × 10⁻²⁸) * (61.165)`\n`U_total ≈ 2.82214 × 10⁻²⁶ J`\n\nRounding to three decimal places, the minimum energy of the system is `2.822 × 10⁻²⁶ J`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
