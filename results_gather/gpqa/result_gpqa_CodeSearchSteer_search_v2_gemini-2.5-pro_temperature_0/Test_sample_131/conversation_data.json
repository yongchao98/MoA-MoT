    "To solve this problem, we must analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each potential compound and then determine which 1:1 mixture would produce the observed spectrum.\n\n### Analysis of Individual Compounds\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** Due to its high symmetry, all four methyl groups are chemically equivalent, and the two aromatic protons are also equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** One singlet (2H).\n    *   **Alkyl signals:** One singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has lower symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** Two singlets (1H each), as the two aromatic protons are in different chemical environments.\n    *   **Alkyl signals:** Three singlets with an integration ratio of 6:3:3 (or 2:1:1). The methyl groups at positions 1 and 3 are equivalent (6H), while the methyl groups at positions 2 and 5 are unique (3H each).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** One singlet (2H), as the two aromatic protons are equivalent.\n    *   **Alkyl signals:** Two singlets with an integration ratio of 6:6 (or 1:1). The methyl groups at positions 1 and 4 are equivalent (6H), and the methyl groups at positions 2 and 3 are also equivalent to each other (6H).\n\n*   **1,4-Diethylbenzene:** This compound has a high degree of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** One singlet (4H).\n    *   **Alkyl signals:** It would show a quartet (from the -CH2- groups) and a triplet (from the -CH3 groups), not just singlets. This option can be immediately ruled out based on the alkyl signal description.\n\n### Analysis of the 1:1 Mixture\n\nThe experimental spectrum shows:\n*   **Aromatic region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Alkyl region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options for a 1:1 mixture:\n\n**A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   Aromatic: 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show three aromatic singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio (assuming no overlap). This does not match.\n\n**B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n*   Alkyl: 1,4-diethylbenzene would show a quartet and a triplet. This does not match the \"all singlets\" description.\n\n**C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   Aromatic: 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show three aromatic singlets with a 2:1:1 ratio (assuming no overlap). This does not match.\n\n**D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   **Aromatic Signals:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet integrating to 2 protons.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes one singlet integrating to 2 protons.\n    *   In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets** with a **1:1 integration ratio** (2H:2H). This perfectly matches the description of the aromatic region.\n*   **Alkyl Signals:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet for its 12 equivalent protons.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two singlets, each for 6 protons.\n    *   In the 1:1 mixture, the total proton integration for the alkyl signals would be 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to a **2:1:1 ratio**. This perfectly matches the description of the alkyl region.\n\nTherefore, the mixture contains 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<D>>>"
