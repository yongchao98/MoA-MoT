    "### Analysis of Tautomerism and Optical Isomerism\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\nTautomerism is a type of isomerism where a molecule exists in two or more interconvertible forms that differ in the position of a proton and a double bond. For keto-enol tautomerism, the presence of an alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) is typically required.\n\n*   **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** This molecule has a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups and two carbon-carbon double bonds. The carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the double bonds and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached. Therefore, benzoquinone lacks the necessary alpha-hydrogens to undergo standard keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has three carbonyl groups in a six-membered ring. The carbon atoms between the carbonyl groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are alpha-carbons, and each is bonded to two hydrogen atoms. These alpha-hydrogens allow the compound to undergo tautomerism. In fact, it readily converts to its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol). This enol form is exceptionally stable because it is an aromatic compound, which is a much more stable state than the non-aromatic trione form.\n\n**Conclusion for A:** Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The chemical formula is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. The central carbon atom (at position 2) is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    1.  a hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  a hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  a methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon has four different substituents, it is a chiral center. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exists as a pair of optical isomers (enantiomers).\n\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, with the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. It is a trans-isomer. The molecule does not contain any carbon atom bonded to four different groups; thus, it has no chiral center. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry and is achiral. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism. It does, however, exhibit geometric (cis-trans) isomerism with its counterpart, dimethyl maleate.\n\n**Conclusion for B:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism.\n\n**Final Answer Determination:**\n\n*   The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   The compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis combination matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
