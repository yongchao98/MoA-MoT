    "To find the partition function Z for the system of three spins S1, S2, and S3, we must sum over all possible microstates of the system. The partition function is defined as:\n\nZ = Σ_states * e^(-βE)\n\nwhere the sum is over all possible configurations of the spins, E is the energy of a given configuration, and β = 1/(kT).\n\nEach spin can take a value of +1 or -1, so there are 2^3 = 8 possible microstates for the system. We need to calculate the energy for each of these states.\n\nThe energy is given by the formula: E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]\n\nLet's list all 8 possible states and their corresponding energies:\n\n**Case 1: All spins are aligned.**\n*   **State 1:** (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, +1)\n    E₁ = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n*   **State 2:** (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, -1)\n    E₂ = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\nThere are two states with an energy of -3J. The contribution of these two states to the partition function is 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) = 2e^(3Jβ).\n\n**Case 2: One spin is flipped relative to the other two.**\nThis case includes configurations where two spins are up (+1) and one is down (-1), or one spin is up (+1) and two are down (-1).\n*   **State 3:** (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, -1)\n    E₃ = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n*   **State 4:** (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, +1)\n    E₄ = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n*   **State 5:** (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, +1)\n    E₅ = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n*   **State 6:** (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, -1)\n    E₆ = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n*   **State 7:** (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, -1)\n    E₇ = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n*   **State 8:** (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, +1)\n    E₈ = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n\nThere are six states with an energy of J. The contribution of these six states to the partition function is 6 * e^(-βJ) = 6e^(-Jβ).\n\n**Total Partition Function (Z):**\nTo get the total partition function, we sum the contributions from all the states:\n\nZ = (Contribution from E = -3J) + (Contribution from E = J)\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
