The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 could bind to nsp10 making an active exonuclease complex that prevents the breakdown of dsRNA.\nC) Programmed ribosomal frameshifting creates two polyproteins near to 5` end of the genome by moving back by 1 nucleotide with the help of slippery nucleotides, and pseudoknot. The SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed ribosomal frameshifting.\nD) SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a has the ability to trigger caspase-8 activation/cleavage, without affecting the expression levels of Bcl-2. Caspase-8 activation is recognized as a characteristic feature of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway via death receptors, while Bcl-2 plays a crucial role in initiating the mitochondrial pathway. This suggests that the mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces apoptosis is via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>",

[2, 9, 12] The SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed ribosomal frameshifting. [6, 15, 25]\nD) SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a has the ability to trigger caspase-8 activation/cleavage, without affecting the expression levels of Bcl-2. [3, 19] Caspase-8 activation is recognized as a characteristic feature of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway via death receptors, while Bcl-2 plays a crucial role in initiating the mitochondrial pathway. This suggests that the mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces apoptosis is via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. [3, 7]\n\nThe incorrect statement is **B**. The SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN complex is a proofreading exoribonuclease that functions as a heterodimer in a mismatch repair mechanism. [13, 16, 18] The nsp10 protein activates the N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14. [1, 16] However, this active exonuclease complex is responsible for the *degradation* or *hydrolysis* of dsRNA, particularly at mismatched 3' ends, rather than preventing its breakdown. [1, 28] Its function is to remove errors during RNA replication, which involves cleaving phosphodiester bonds in the RNA backbone.\n\n<<<B>>>"
