    "An N-sided polygonal aperture where N is infinitely large is equivalent to a circular aperture. The apothem 'a' of the polygon becomes the radius of the circle.\n\nThe problem, therefore, is to find the angular distance between the first two minima in the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern of a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\nThe angular positions of the minima in the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture are given by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x). The condition for the minima is:\n\nsin(θ) ≈ θ = (zₙ * λ) / (2π * a)\n\nwhere:\n*   θ is the angular position of a minimum.\n*   λ is the wavelength of the light.\n*   a is the radius of the circular aperture.\n*   zₙ are the zeros of the Bessel function J₁(x).\n\nThe first two zeros of J₁(x) are approximately:\n*   z₁ ≈ 3.8317\n*   z₂ ≈ 7.0156\n\nNow, we can calculate the angular positions of the first and second minima.\n\n**Angular position of the first minimum (θ₁):**\nUsing the small angle approximation, the position of the first minimum is given by θ = 1.22λ/D, where D is the diameter of the aperture. Since the radius is 'a', the diameter D = 2a.\nθ₁ = 1.22 * λ / (2a) = 0.610 * λ / a.\n\nAlternatively, using the Bessel function zero:\nθ₁ ≈ (3.8317 * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ 0.6098 * λ / a\n\n**Angular position of the second minimum (θ₂):**\nThe position of the second minimum is given by sin(θ_min) = 2.23 λ/D.\nθ₂ ≈ 2.23 * λ / (2a) = 1.115 * λ / a.\n\nUsing the second Bessel function zero:\nθ₂ ≈ (7.0156 * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ 1.1166 * λ / a\n\n**Angular distance between the first two minima (Δθ):**\nThe angular distance is the difference between the angular positions of the second and first minima.\nΔθ = θ₂ - θ₁\nΔθ ≈ (1.1166 * λ / a) - (0.6098 * λ / a)\nΔθ ≈ 0.5068 * λ / a\n\nThis value is approximately 0.506 λ / a.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0.610 λ / a (This is the position of the first minimum)\nB) 0.506 λ / a\nC) 0.500 λ / a\nD) 1.220 λ / a (This is related to the Rayleigh criterion for the diameter)\n\nThe calculated angular distance matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
