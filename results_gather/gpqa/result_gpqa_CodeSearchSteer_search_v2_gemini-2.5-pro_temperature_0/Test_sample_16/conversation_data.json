    "To determine the concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], from a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we need to consider the dissociation equilibrium of the complex.\n\nThe formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is represented by the reaction:\nCa²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca-EDTA]²⁻\n\nThe formation constant (K_f), also known as the stability constant, for this reaction is given as:\nK_f = [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\nThe problem asks for the concentration of free Ca²⁺ ions, which result from the dissociation of the complex. The dissociation is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n[Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\nLet 'x' be the equilibrium concentration of free Ca²⁺ ions. According to the stoichiometry of the dissociation, the concentration of free EDTA⁴⁻ will also be 'x'. The concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex at equilibrium will be its initial concentration minus the amount that has dissociated.\n\nThe setup for the equilibrium concentrations is as follows:\n*   **[Ca²⁺] = x**\n*   **[EDTA⁴⁻] = x**\n*   **[[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] = 0.02 - x**\n\nNow, we substitute these values into the formation constant expression:\nK_f = (0.02 - x) / (x * x) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\nBecause the formation constant (K_f) is very large, the equilibrium lies far to the right, meaning the complex is very stable and only a very small amount will dissociate. Therefore, 'x' will be significantly smaller than the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). This allows for a simplifying assumption:\n0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\nThe equation simplifies to:\n5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\nx² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ (2 x 10⁻²) / (5 x 10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ 0.4 x 10⁻¹²\nx² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\nx = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is therefore approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M. This value matches option B. The problem's assumption of an \"ideal pH\" is important, as the stability of the Ca-EDTA complex is pH-dependent; an ideal pH (typically around 10 or higher) ensures that EDTA is predominantly in its fully deprotonated form (EDTA⁴⁻), making the given K_f value applicable.\n\n<<<B>>>"
