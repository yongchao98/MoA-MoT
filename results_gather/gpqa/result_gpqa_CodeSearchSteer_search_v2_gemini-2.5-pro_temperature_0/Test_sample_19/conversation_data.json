    "The impulse approximation in many-body nuclear calculations is based on a set of simplifying assumptions about how a probe (like an electron or neutrino) interacts with a nucleon inside a nucleus. The core idea is to treat the complex interaction with the nucleus as a much simpler interaction with a single, quasi-free nucleon.\n\nThe key assumptions are:\n\n1.  **The interaction involves only one nucleon:** The incoming particle interacts with just one nucleon at a time. The total interaction is considered an incoherent sum of these individual events. This is also known as the \"one-body current\" assumption.\n2.  **The nucleus is transparent to the interacting particles:** The incoming probe and the outgoing particles (the scattered probe and the struck nucleon) do not interact with the rest of the (A-1) nucleons in the nucleus. This neglects \"final-state interactions.\" This is a key feature of the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation (PWIA).\n3.  **The interaction time is very short:** The collision happens so quickly that the binding forces holding the nucleon within the nucleus can be ignored during the interaction itself. The nucleon is treated as if it were a free particle, albeit one that has momentum from its previous state within the nucleus.\n\nAnalyzing the given options:\n*   **1. The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.** This aligns with the one-body current assumption.\n*   **2. The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.** This aligns with the neglect of final-state interactions.\n*   **3. The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.** This assumption concerns the internal structure of the nucleon itself, which is a separate area of physics (related to nucleon form factors) and not a defining assumption of the impulse approximation at the nuclear level. The impulse approximation treats nucleons as the fundamental particles, not their constituent quarks.\n*   **4. The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.** This aligns with the assumption that the interaction is instantaneous and the nucleon is \"quasi-free.\"\n\nTherefore, the three assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
