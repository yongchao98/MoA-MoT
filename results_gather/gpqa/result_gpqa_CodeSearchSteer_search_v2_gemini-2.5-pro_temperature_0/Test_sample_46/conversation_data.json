    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    The degree of unsaturation is calculated as follows: `C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)`.\n    For C9H11NO2, this is `9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5`.\n    A degree of unsaturation of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n2.  **Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Given the molecular formula and other data, this is consistent with an ester.\n\n3.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to three protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to two protons indicates a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃-). The combination of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and this quartet at 4.5 ppm confirms the presence of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) is characteristic of a methylene group attached to an oxygen atom, as in an ethyl ester (-O-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding and quadrupolar relaxation. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons on the ring are split into two distinct signals. The upfield doublet (~7.0 ppm) is adjacent to an electron-donating group (the -NH₂), while the downfield doublet (~8.0 ppm) is adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (the ester, -COOEt).\n\n4.  **Assemble the Structure and Evaluate the Options**\n    The data points to a structure with a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring, a primary amine group, and an ethyl ester group. Assembling these pieces gives ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n    Let's check this against the given options:\n    *   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR and has a different NMR pattern.\n    *   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure, also known as Benzocaine, perfectly matches all the data:\n        *   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂.\n        *   **IR:** Has a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ester carbonyl (C=O).\n        *   **¹H NMR:** Has an ethyl ester group, a primary amine, and a 1,4-disubstituted aromatic ring. Published spectra for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate show signals at approximately 1.35 ppm (t, 3H), 4.16 ppm (s, br, 2H, -NH₂), 4.31 ppm (q, 2H), 6.62 ppm (d, 2H), and 7.84 ppm (d, 2H), which are in excellent agreement with the provided data.\n    *   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This has a propionate group attached to the phenolic oxygen. The NMR signal for the -CH₂- next to the carbonyl would be much further upfield (around 2.3-2.6 ppm), not at 4.5 ppm.\n    *   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a primary amide, and the carbonyl IR stretch would be at a lower frequency (~1680 cm⁻¹). The aromatic substitution is meta, which would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the NMR, not two clean doublets.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe spectroscopic data is unequivocally consistent with the structure of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>"
