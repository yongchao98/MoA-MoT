    "To determine the correct starting materials, we must analyze the selectivity of the two reducing agents, LiBH₄ and BH₃, and how they react with the functional groups present in the proposed starting materials.\n\n### Analysis of the Reactions\n\nThe starting material in the options is a dicarboxylic acid monoester: 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, which can be structurally represented as `iBu-O-CO-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`. This molecule has two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an isobutyl ester (-COOiBu).\n\nThe product in both reactions is a lactone (a cyclic ester), 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This lactone is formed from the intramolecular cyclization of 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid (`HO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`).\n\nTherefore, the overall transformation requires the reduction of one of the carbonyl groups of the starting material to a primary alcohol, followed by cyclization. The stereochemistry at the C3 position of the starting acid corresponds to the C4 position of the product lactone, and this stereocenter is not affected by the reduction reactions.\n\n### Reaction A\n*   **Reagents**: LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) followed by H⁺ (acidic workup).\n*   **Product**: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   **Selectivity of LiBH₄**: Lithium borohydride is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. Therefore, LiBH₄ will reduce the isobutyl ester group to a primary alcohol, leaving the carboxylic acid group intact.\n*   **Reaction Pathway**:\n    1.  `iBu-O-CO-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH` is treated with LiBH₄. The ester is reduced, yielding the intermediate 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid: `HO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`.\n    2.  The subsequent acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of the hydroxy acid to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry**: Since the reaction does not alter the chiral center, the stereochemistry of the starting material A must match the stereochemistry of the product. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Reaction B\n*   **Reagents**: BH₃ (Borane) followed by H⁺ (acidic workup).\n*   **Product**: (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   **Selectivity of BH₃**: Borane is a reducing agent that is highly selective for carboxylic acids, reducing them much faster than esters.\n*   **Reaction Pathway**:\n    1.  `iBu-O-CO-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH` is treated with BH₃. The carboxylic acid is selectively reduced to a primary alcohol, yielding the intermediate isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate: `iBu-O-CO-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH`.\n    2.  The acidic workup (H⁺) then catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed primary alcohol attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol and forming the cyclic lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry**: As with the first reaction, the chiral center is preserved. To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the selective nature of the reducing agents:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
