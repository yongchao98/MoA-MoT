    "The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed as a local, relativistic quantum field theory. As such, it must adhere to certain fundamental symmetries.\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry:** This is a fundamental symmetry of spacetime in special relativity, and any relativistic quantum field theory, including SMEFT, is built to be Lorentz invariant. This means the laws of physics are the same for all observers in inertial frames.\n\n2.  **Poincaré Symmetry:** This is an extension of Lorentz symmetry that also includes translations in space and time. The SMEFT Lagrangian is constructed to be invariant under the Poincaré group.\n\n3.  **CP Symmetry:** CP (Charge-Parity) symmetry is the combination of charge conjugation (C) and parity inversion (P). The Standard Model itself contains sources of CP violation, and SMEFT, as an extension, also includes operators that can violate CP symmetry. In fact, searching for new sources of CP violation is a major goal of experiments that use the SMEFT framework. Therefore, CP symmetry is not a required symmetry for all SMEFT operators.\n\n4.  **CPT Symmetry:** The CPT theorem is a fundamental principle of quantum field theory which states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian is invariant under the combined transformation of charge conjugation (C), parity inversion (P), and time reversal (T). Since SMEFT is constructed as a local and Lorentz-invariant theory, all of its operators must respect CPT symmetry.\n\nBased on this, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, and CPT symmetry.\n\n<<<C>>>"
