    "To determine the pH of the final solution, we must first calculate the number of moles of acid and base being mixed.\n\n1.  **Calculate the initial moles of each substance:**\n    *   **CH3COOH (weak acid):** Moles = Volume × Molarity = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = 0.050 moles.\n    *   **HCl (strong acid):** Moles = Volume × Molarity = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.080 moles. Since HCl is a strong acid, it completely dissociates, providing 0.080 moles of H⁺ ions.\n    *   **Ba(OH)2 (strong base):** Moles = Volume × Molarity = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.090 moles. Since Ba(OH)2 is a strong base that releases two hydroxide ions per formula unit (Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻), the moles of OH⁻ ions are 2 × 0.090 = 0.180 moles.\n\n2.  **Perform the neutralization reactions:**\n    *   First, the strong acid (H⁺ from HCl) will react with the strong base (OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂).\n        *   H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O\n        *   We have 0.080 moles of H⁺ and 0.180 moles of OH⁻. The H⁺ is the limiting reactant.\n        *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.180 moles - 0.080 moles = 0.100 moles.\n    *   Next, the remaining strong base (OH⁻) will react with the weak acid (CH₃COOH).\n        *   CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n        *   We have 0.050 moles of CH₃COOH and 0.100 moles of remaining OH⁻. The CH₃COOH is the limiting reactant.\n        *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining after this reaction = 0.100 moles - 0.050 moles = 0.050 moles.\n\n3.  **Calculate the final concentration and pH:**\n    *   After all reactions, the solution has an excess of 0.050 moles of OH⁻ ions. The presence of this strong base will determine the pH of the solution.\n    *   The total volume of the mixed solution is 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL or 1.2 L.\n    *   The final concentration of OH⁻ is:\n        *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume = 0.050 moles / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M.\n    *   Now, we can calculate the pOH:\n        *   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38.\n    *   Finally, we find the pH using the relationship pH + pOH = 14.\n        *   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.\n\nThe pH of the resulting solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<A>>>"
