    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\nThe starting material, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, has an alcohol functional group. In the presence of sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, the alcohol is deprotonated to form a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile and reacts with benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis. The result is the formation of a benzyl ether.\n\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\nProduct 1, which contains a ketone, is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (also known as tosylhydrazide) in the presence of an acid catalyst. This is a condensation reaction that converts the ketone into a tosylhydrazone.\n\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\nProduct 2 is subjected to the conditions of a Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of a strong base, n-butyllithium (n-BuLi). This process eliminates the tosylhydrazone group and forms a carbon-carbon double bond where the ketone was originally located. The reaction is regioselective, typically forming the less sterically hindered, or kinetic, alkene product. The subsequent addition of aqueous ammonium chloride serves to quench the reaction.\n\n*   **Product 3:** 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n\nProduct 3 is treated with palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere. This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. This step results in two transformations:\n1.  **Hydrogenation of Alkenes:** Both the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain are reduced to single bonds. This converts the isopropenyl group to an isopropyl group and the cyclohexene ring to a cyclohexane ring.\n2.  **Hydrogenolysis of the Benzyl Ether:** The benzyl ether protecting group is cleaved by the Pd/C and H₂ to regenerate the alcohol.\n\nThe final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. Based on the positions in the starting material, these two groups are in a 1,3- (or meta) relationship on the cyclohexane ring.\n\n*   **Product 4:** (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol\n\nComparing this final structure to the given options:\n\n*   A) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. The benzyl ether is removed, and the Shapiro reaction does not add a butyl group.\n*   B) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. The benzyl ether is cleaved in the final step.\n*   C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: Correct. This matches the structure derived from the reaction sequence.\n*   D) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. This represents an intermediate stage or an alternative reaction pathway, not the final product after the Shapiro and hydrogenation steps.\n\n<<<C>>>"
