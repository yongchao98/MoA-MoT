    "To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we can use the principles of planetary equilibrium temperature and Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion.\n\n### 1. Equilibrium Temperature\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates back into space. This temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the planet's distance (a) from its star. The relationship can be expressed as:\n\nT_eq ∝ 1 / √a\n\n### 2. Kepler's Third Law\n\nKepler's Third Law states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is directly proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a), which is the average distance from the star. For the circular orbits mentioned in the problem, the semi-major axis is the orbital radius. The law is written as:\n\nP² ∝ a³\n\nFrom this, we can express the distance (a) in terms of the period (P):\n\na ∝ P^(2/3)\n\n### 3. Combining the Relationships\n\nBy substituting the expression for distance (a) from Kepler's Third Law into the equilibrium temperature formula, we can find the relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital period:\n\nT_eq ∝ 1 / √(P^(2/3))\nT_eq ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)\n\nThis shows that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Temperature Ratio\n\nWe can now write the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2 as a function of their orbital periods (P4 and P2):\n\nT_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = (P2 / P4)^(1/3)\n\nThe problem provides the ratio of the orbital periods for the five planets as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Therefore, the ratio of the period of Planet_2 to Planet_4 is:\n\nP2 / P4 = 2 / 3.5 = 4 / 7\n\nNow, we can calculate the temperature ratio:\n\nTemperature Ratio = (4 / 7)^(1/3)\nTemperature Ratio ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3)\nTemperature Ratio ≈ 0.8298\n\nThis value is approximately 0.83.\n\nThe problem states that the planets have the same albedo, which is a necessary condition for this direct comparison. The discovery of the planets through the Transit Timing Variation (TTV) method and their state of orbital resonance are contextual details that confirm the interconnected nature of the system but do not alter the fundamental physical laws used for the calculation.\n\nBased on the calculation, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately 0.83.\n\n<<<A>>>"
