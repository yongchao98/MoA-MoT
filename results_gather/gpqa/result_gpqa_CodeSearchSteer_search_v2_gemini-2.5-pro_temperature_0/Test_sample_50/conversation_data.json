    "To calculate the net potential energy of a system where a charge *q* is placed a distance *d* from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius *R*, we can use the method of images.\n\n1.  **The Method of Images**: This technique simplifies the problem by replacing the grounded sphere with an \"image charge\" (*q'*) inside the sphere. This image charge, along with the original charge *q*, reproduces the zero potential on the surface of the sphere.\n\n2.  **Image Charge and its Position**:\n    *   The magnitude of the image charge is `q' = -q(R/d)`.\n    *   It is located at a distance `d' = R²/d` from the center of the sphere, on the line connecting the center and the charge *q*.\n\n3.  **Calculating Potential Energy**: The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge *q* from infinity to the distance *d*. A common mistake is to simply calculate the interaction energy between the real charge *q* and the image charge *q'*. The correct potential energy of the system is half of the interaction energy between the real charge and its image charge. This factor of 1/2 accounts for the self-energy of the induced charge on the sphere's surface.\n\n4.  **Interaction Energy Calculation**:\n    *   The distance between the real charge *q* and the image charge *q'* is `d - d' = d - R²/d = (d² - R²)/d`.\n    *   The interaction energy (*U_interaction*) between *q* and *q'* is given by Coulomb's law:\n        `U_interaction = k * q * q' / (d - d')`\n        Substituting the values for *q'* and *(d - d')*:\n        `U_interaction = k * q * [-q(R/d)] / [(d² - R²)/d]`\n        `U_interaction = - (k * q² * R) / (d² - R²)`\n\n5.  **Net Potential Energy of the System**:\n    *   As established, the net potential energy (*U*) is half of this interaction energy:\n        `U = (1/2) * U_interaction`\n        `U = (1/2) * [- (k * q² * R) / (d² - R²)]`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n\nA) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\nB) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\nC) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\nD) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nThe calculated potential energy matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
