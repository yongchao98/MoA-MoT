    "A dominant-negative mutation produces a mutant protein that interferes with the function of the wild-type protein from the other allele. In this scenario, the transcription factor must form a dimer to be active. The Y mutation is in the dimerization domain.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the most likely molecular event:\n*   **Heterodimer Formation:** The mutant protein (Y) is still produced and can dimerize with the wild-type (WT) protein, forming a non-functional Y-WT heterodimer. This is a classic mechanism for dominant-negative effects, often called a \"spoiler\" effect.\n*   **Loss of Function:** Because the wild-type proteins are sequestered into these inactive complexes, the overall concentration of functional WT-WT dimers is significantly reduced, leading to a loss-of-function phenotype.\n*   **Protein Degradation:** Aberrant or non-functional protein complexes, such as the Y-WT dimer, are often recognized by the cell's quality control machinery and targeted for degradation by the proteasome. This would result in the degradation of not only the mutant protein but also the wild-type protein that is bound to it. This degradation actively reduces the amount of available wild-type protein, causing a loss of function from the wild-type allele.\n\nConsidering the choices:\n*   **A) protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele:** This aligns perfectly with the mechanism. The formation of a non-functional dimer with the mutant protein leads to the degradation of the complex, which includes the wild-type protein. This directly causes a loss of function attributable to the wild-type allele, which is the definition of a dominant-negative effect.\n*   **B) protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype:** While aggregation can be a consequence of mutations, it is a more specific phenomenon. The primary mechanism of a dominant-negative mutation in a dimeric protein is interference, not necessarily aggregation.\n*   **C) change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype:** This is incorrect. A dominant-negative mutation results in a loss-of-function phenotype.\n*   **D) loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype:** This is contradictory. A loss of dimerization would cause a loss-of-function, not a wild-type, phenotype.\n\nTherefore, the most complete and likely description of the molecular phenotype is protein degradation leading to the loss of function of the wild-type allele.\n\n<<<A>>>"
