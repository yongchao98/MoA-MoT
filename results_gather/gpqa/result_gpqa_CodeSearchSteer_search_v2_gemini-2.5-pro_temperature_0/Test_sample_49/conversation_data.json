    "The number of loops in a Feynman diagram can be determined from the powers of `4π` in the mathematical expression for the diagram's amplitude. This is a standard feature of a common calculation technique called dimensional regularization.\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\n*   **Loop Integrals:** In quantum field theory, each closed loop in a Feynman diagram corresponds to an integral over an undetermined momentum.\n*   **Dimensional Regularization:** To handle the divergences that often appear in these integrals, physicists use a method called dimensional regularization. This technique involves calculating the integral in a general `d`-dimensional spacetime and then taking the limit as `d` approaches 4.\n*   **The `4π` Factor:** A key result of this method is that each loop integral in `d=4` dimensions contributes a factor of `1/(4π)²` to the final expression.\n*   **Applying to the Note:** The scribbled note contains the term `1/(4π)⁶`.\n\nLet `L` be the number of loops in the diagram. The total factor from all the loop integrals will be `(1/(4π)²)^L`.\n\nBy comparing this with the term from the note, we can set up a simple equation:\n\n`(1/(4π)²)^L = 1/(4π)⁶`\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n`2L = 6`\n\nSolving for `L` gives:\n\n`L = 3`\n\nTherefore, the Feynman diagram contained 3 loops.\n\n<<<C>>>"
