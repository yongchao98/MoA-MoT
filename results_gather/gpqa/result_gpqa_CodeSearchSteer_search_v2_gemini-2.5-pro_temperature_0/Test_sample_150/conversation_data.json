    "To calculate the probability that the measurement of the observable P will yield the value 0, we follow the principles of quantum mechanics. The probability of measuring a specific eigenvalue is the squared magnitude of the projection of the system's state vector onto the eigenvector corresponding to that eigenvalue.\n\nHere is a step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Define the state vector and the observable operator:**\n    The state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix:\n    `|ψ⟩ = (-1, 2, 1)`\n\n    The observable of the system is represented by the matrix operator P:\n    `P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n\n2.  **Find the eigenvalues of the operator P:**\n    To find the eigenvalues (λ), we solve the characteristic equation `det(P - λI) = 0`.\n    `det([[ -λ, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, -λ, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, -λ]]) = -λ(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)(-λ/√2) = -λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 = -λ³ + λ = λ(1 - λ²) = 0`\n    The eigenvalues are λ = 0, 1, and -1. The question asks for the probability of the measurement yielding 0.\n\n3.  **Find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue λ = 0:**\n    We need to solve the equation `P|v⟩ = 0|v⟩`, where `|v⟩` is the eigenvector `(x, y, z)`.\n    `[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] * [x, y, z] = [0, 0, 0]`\n    This results in the system of equations:\n    *   `(1/√2)y = 0`  which implies `y = 0`.\n    *   `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0` which implies `x + z = 0` or `x = -z`.\n\n    The unnormalized eigenvector for λ = 0 is of the form `(x, 0, -x)`. We can choose x=1, giving `|v₀⟩ = (1, 0, -1)`.\n\n4.  **Normalize the eigenvector `|v₀⟩`:**\n    The squared norm is `||v₀||² = 1² + 0² + (-1)² = 2`.\n    The normalized eigenvector is `|v₀_norm⟩ = (1/√2) * (1, 0, -1) = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)`.\n\n5.  **Normalize the state vector `|ψ⟩`:**\n    The squared norm is `||ψ||² = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`.\n    The normalized state vector is `|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * (-1, 2, 1)`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the probability:**\n    The probability `Prob(λ=0)` is given by the squared magnitude of the inner product of the normalized eigenvector and the normalized state vector, `|⟨v₀_norm|ψ_norm⟩|²`.\n    `⟨v₀_norm|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2) ⋅ (1/√6) * (-1, 2, 1)`\n    `= (1/√12) * [(1 * -1) + (0 * 2) + (-1 * 1)]`\n    `= (1/√12) * (-2) = -2 / (2√3) = -1/√3`\n\n    The probability is the square of the magnitude of this value:\n    `Prob(λ=0) = |-1/√3|² = 1/3`.\n\nAlternatively, one can calculate the probability using the unnormalized vectors:\n`Prob(λ=0) = |⟨v₀|ψ⟩|² / (||v₀||² * ||ψ||²)`\n`⟨v₀|ψ⟩ = (1, 0, -1) ⋅ (-1, 2, 1) = -1 + 0 - 1 = -2`\n`|⟨v₀|ψ⟩|² = (-2)² = 4`\n`||v₀||² = 2`\n`||ψ||² = 6`\n`Prob(λ=0) = 4 / (2 * 6) = 4 / 12 = 1/3`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
