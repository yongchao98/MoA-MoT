    "Based on the detailed analysis of the provided clues, the substances involved have been identified as follows:\n\n*   **Substance X**: Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄). This is deduced from its nature as a powerful reducing agent (a close analog, LiAlH₄, is a very common reagent in organic chemistry), its reaction to form the other identified products, and its role in the reduction of a keto acid. The reaction of a keto acid (containing a ketone and a carboxylic acid) with a strong reducing agent like LiAlH₄ (or its deuterated analog LiAlD₄) reduces both functional groups to alcohols, resulting in a diol which contains two oxygen atoms.\n*   **Liquid Y**: Heavy Water (D₂O). Its reaction with a deuteride source like LiAlD₄ is violent and produces the identified gas and precipitate.\n*   **Gas W**: Deuterium gas (D₂). A molecule of D₂ contains one proton and one neutron in each of its two atoms, for a total of two protons and two neutrons, fitting the description of having an equal number of protons and neutrons.\n*   **Precipitate G**: Aluminium Deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃). This is formed from the reaction of LiAlD₄ and D₂O.\n*   **Substance B**: Heavy Water (D₂O). When precipitate G, Al(OD)₃, is heated, it decomposes and releases heavy water. The melting point of heavy water is 276.97 K (3.82 °C), which is very close to the stated 277 K.\n\nThe core reaction is:\nLiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → 4D₂ (W) + Al(OD)₃ (G) + LiOD\n\nWith Substance X identified as LiAlD₄, the final calculation can be performed. The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within LiAlD₄.\n\n1.  **Elements in LiAlD₄**: Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Deuterium (D), which is an isotope of Hydrogen.\n2.  **Atomic Masses (using mass numbers for isotopes)**:\n    *   Deuterium (²H or D): Mass number = 2\n    *   Lithium (assumed to be the most common isotope, ⁷Li): Mass number = 7\n    *   Aluminium (only stable isotope is ²⁷Al): Mass number = 27\n3.  **Lightest and Heaviest Elements**:\n    *   The lightest element is Deuterium (mass ≈ 2 u).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminium (mass ≈ 27 u).\n4.  **Cumulative Mass Calculation**: The problem requires summing the masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements in the molecule.\n    *   The formula is LiAlD₄.\n    *   There are four atoms of the lightest element (Deuterium): 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   There is one atom of the heaviest element (Aluminium): 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   The cumulative mass is the sum of these values: 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n<<<D>>>"
