    "This is a classic stoichiometry problem that can be solved by carefully analyzing the products of the thermal decomposition. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Gaseous Products\n\nThe problem states that a mixture of gases is formed and passed through a series of tubes. Let's analyze the mass change of each tube to identify the products and their quantities.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.02 g/mol\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.2 mol\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which absorbs acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. Since the weight of this tube did not change, no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Copper at high temperatures reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass increase of the tube (0.80 g) is the mass of the oxygen that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 0.80 g\n    *   Molar mass of O ≈ 16.00 g/mol\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol\n    *   Since oxygen gas is diatomic (O₂), the moles of O₂ gas are half the moles of O atoms.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 liters of a gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP). This gas is non-reactive towards water absorbers, bases, and hot copper. This strongly suggests the gas is nitrogen (N₂).\n    *   Volume of N₂ = 2.24 L\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of N₂ = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol\n\n### 2. Verify Mass Conservation and Identify the Salts\n\nThe total mass of the gaseous products should equal the initial mass of the salt mixture.\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.025 mol * 32.00 g/mol = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of N₂ = 0.1 mol * 28.02 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   **Total Mass of Gases** = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g\n\nThis matches the initial mass of the salt mixture perfectly, confirming our analysis of the products is correct. The decomposition of salts A and B yields H₂O, O₂, and N₂. The presence of nitrogen and hydrogen points towards ammonium salts, and the presence of oxygen suggests nitrate or nitrite anions.\n\nLet's examine the decomposition of likely candidates:\n*   **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** Decomposes to produce nitrogen and water:\n    NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** Its decomposition can be complex. While it often produces N₂O and H₂O, at higher temperatures or under certain conditions, it can decompose to nitrogen, oxygen, and water:\n    2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\nThe problem states it's an equimolar mixture. Let's assume salts A and B are ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate. Let 'x' be the number of moles for each salt.\n*   From `x` moles of NH₄NO₂, we get: `x` moles of N₂ and `2x` moles of H₂O.\n*   From `x` moles of NH₄NO₃, we get: `x` moles of N₂, `0.5x` moles of O₂, and `2x` moles of H₂O (based on the second reaction, per mole of NH₄NO₃).\n\nTotal moles of products from the mixture:\n*   Total N₂ = x + x = 2x\n*   Total H₂O = 2x + 2x = 4x\n*   Total O₂ = 0.5x\n\nThe molar ratio of the products is N₂ : H₂O : O₂ = 2x : 4x : 0.5x, which simplifies to **4 : 8 : 1**.\n\nLet's compare this to the experimental ratio from Step 1:\n*   N₂ : H₂O : O₂ = 0.1 mol : 0.2 mol : 0.025 mol\n*   Dividing by the smallest value (0.025), we get the ratio **4 : 8 : 1**.\n\nThe ratios match perfectly. Therefore, the salts A and B are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms\n\nThe final step is to find the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of the two salts.\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite):** NH₄NO₂\n    *   Atoms = 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = **8 atoms**\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate):** NH₄NO₃\n    *   Atoms = 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = **9 atoms**\n\nThe total number of atoms in salts A and B is the sum of the atoms in each formula unit:\nTotal Atoms = 8 + 9 = 17\n\n<<<C>>>"
