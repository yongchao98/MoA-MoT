    "The problem involves the decay of a stationary positive pion (π⁺) into a positive muon (μ⁺) and a muon neutrino (ν). To find the kinetic energies of the product particles, we apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n**1. Conservation of Momentum:**\nSince the initial pion is at rest, its total momentum is zero. To conserve momentum, the two product particles, the muon and the neutrino, must move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n\n*   p_μ = p_ν = p\n\nWhere *p_μ* is the momentum of the muon and *p_ν* is the momentum of the neutrino.\n\n**2. Conservation of Energy:**\nThe total energy before the decay is the rest energy of the stationary pion (E_π = m_πc²). After the decay, the total energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon (E_μ) and the neutrino (E_ν).\n\n*   E_π = E_μ + E_ν\n\nThe total energy for a particle is given by the relativistic formula E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n\n*   For the muon: E_μ = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²)\n*   For the neutrino, the rest mass is considered to be zero (m_ν = 0), so its energy is simply E_ν = pc.\n\nSubstituting these into the energy conservation equation:\n\n*   m_πc² = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²) + pc\n\nWe can solve this equation for the momentum *p*. Rearranging and squaring both sides gives:\n\n*   (m_πc² - pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n*   (m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n\nSolving for *pc*:\n\n*   pc = [(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²] / [2 * m_πc²]\n\n**3. Calculation:**\nUsing the given rest masses:\n*   Rest mass of π⁺ (m_πc²) = 139.6 MeV\n*   Rest mass of μ⁺ (m_μc²) = 105.7 MeV\n\nFirst, calculate the momentum energy (*pc*):\n\n*   pc = [(139.6)² - (105.7)²] / [2 * 139.6]\n*   pc = [19488.16 - 11172.49] / 279.2\n*   pc = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.8 MeV\n\n**4. Kinetic Energies:**\nThe kinetic energy (KE) is the total energy minus the rest energy (KE = E - mc²).\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino (KE_ν):**\n    Since the neutrino's rest mass is zero, its kinetic energy is equal to its total energy.\n    KE_ν = E_ν = pc ≈ 29.8 MeV.\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon (KE_μ):**\n    The total energy released in the decay (Q-value) is the difference in the initial and final rest masses:\n    Q = m_πc² - m_μc² = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV.\n    This total released energy is distributed as kinetic energy between the muon and the neutrino.\n    KE_total = KE_μ + KE_ν = 33.9 MeV\n    Therefore, the kinetic energy of the muon is:\n    KE_μ = 33.9 MeV - KE_ν\n    KE_μ = 33.9 MeV - 29.8 MeV = 4.1 MeV.\n\nAlternatively, we can calculate the muon's total energy first and then subtract its rest mass.\nE_μ = m_πc² - E_ν = 139.6 MeV - 29.8 MeV = 109.8 MeV\nKE_μ = E_μ - m_μc² = 109.8 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 4.1 MeV.\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.1 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
