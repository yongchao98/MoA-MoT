    "Here is the step-by-step derivation of the relationship:\n\n1.  **Understand the relationship between distance and parallax.** The parallax of a star (`plx`) is inversely proportional to its distance (`r`). This means that as the distance to a star increases, its parallax angle decreases. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n    `r ∝ 1/plx` or `plx ∝ 1/r`\n\n2.  **Express the number of stars in terms of distance.** The problem states that the total number of observed stars (`N`) up to a certain parallax varies as `1/plx^5`:\n    `N ∝ 1/plx^5`\n\n    We can substitute the relationship between parallax and distance into this equation:\n    `N ∝ 1 / (1/r)^5`\n    `N ∝ r^5`\n\n    This equation tells us that the *total* number of stars observed out to a distance `r` is proportional to the fifth power of the distance.\n\n3.  **Determine the number of stars per unit range of distance.** The question asks how the number of stars changes *per unit range of distance*. This is equivalent to finding the number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance `r`. To find this, we take the derivative of the total number of stars `N` with respect to the distance `r`:\n    `dN/dr ∝ d/dr (r^5)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ 5 * r^4`\n\n    Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to `r^4`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
