    "The analysis of the problem is based on the principles of the radial velocity (RV) method for detecting exoplanets. Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the ratio of the orbital periods.\n\n1.  **Relating Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity:** The RV method measures the periodic Doppler shift of spectral lines from a star. This shift in wavelength (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r) along the line of sight. The amplitude of the observed radial velocity, known as the semi-amplitude (K), is therefore proportional to the maximum observed wavelength shift (Δλ_max).\n    *   K ∝ Δλ_max\n\n    Given the periodic shifts for the two planets' host stars:\n    *   Δλ₁ = 5 mÅ\n    *   Δλ₂ = 7 mÅ\n\n    The ratio of their radial velocity semi-amplitudes is:\n    *   K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4\n\n2.  **The Radial Velocity Semi-Amplitude Formula:** The semi-amplitude (K) of the star's radial velocity is determined by the properties of the star-planet system. For a planet in a circular orbit, the formula is:\n    *   K = (2πG / T)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3))\n    where:\n        *   T is the orbital period.\n        *   m_p is the mass of the planet.\n        *   M_star is the mass of the star.\n        *   i is the inclination of the orbit to the line of sight.\n        *   G is the gravitational constant.\n\n3.  **Applying the Given Information:** The problem provides the following crucial details:\n    *   The stars have \"exactly the same masses\": M_star₁ = M_star₂.\n    *   The planets were detected using the RV method and have \"masses similar to that of Neptune.\" In the context of RV discoveries, the measurable quantity is the minimum mass, m_p * sin(i), not the true mass m_p, as the inclination *i* is generally unknown. Therefore, it is standard to assume that the measured minimum masses are what is being referred to as similar.\n    *   (m_p * sin(i))₁ ≈ (m_p * sin(i))₂\n\n4.  **Calculating the Period Ratio:** We can now set up a ratio of the semi-amplitudes for the two systems:\n    *   K₂ / K₁ = [ (2πG / T₂)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i))₂ / (M_star₂^(2/3)) ] / [ (2πG / T₁)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i))₁ / (M_star₁^(2/3)) ]\n\n    Since the stellar masses and the minimum planetary masses are the same, these terms, along with the constants, cancel out, simplifying the equation significantly:\n    *   K₂ / K₁ = (1 / T₂^(1/3)) / (1 / T₁^(1/3))\n    *   K₂ / K₁ = (T₁ / T₂)^(1/3)\n\n5.  **Solving for the Final Answer:** Substitute the known value of K₂ / K₁ = 1.4 into the simplified equation:\n    *   1.4 = (T₁ / T₂)^(1/3)\n\n    To find the ratio of the periods (T₂ / T₁), we first solve for T₁ / T₂ by cubing both sides:\n    *   T₁ / T₂ = (1.4)³ = 2.744\n\n    Finally, invert the fraction to get the desired ratio:\n    *   T₂ / T₁ = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36.\n\n<<<B>>>"
