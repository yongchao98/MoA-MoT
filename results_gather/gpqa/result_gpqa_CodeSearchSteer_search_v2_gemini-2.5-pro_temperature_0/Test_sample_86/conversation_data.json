    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct 1H NMR data for the described compound.\n\n### 1. Determine the Molecular Structure\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** The compound has a 6-membered aromatic ring, which is a benzene ring (C6).\n*   **Substitution:** It is di-substituted, meaning two groups are attached to the benzene ring.\n*   **Total Carbons:** The molecule contains 8 carbon atoms in total. Since the benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, the two substituents together must contribute the remaining 2 carbons.\n*   **Functional Groups:** The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (a halogen attached directly to the benzene ring).\n\nBased on this information, one substituent is a halogen (-X, where X = F, Cl, Br, or I). The other substituent must contain the two carbons and the carbonyl group. The most common and stable group that fits this description is an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n\nTherefore, the compound is a haloacetophenone, with the general structure X-C6H4-COCH3. This structure satisfies all the given conditions: it's a di-substituted benzene ring, has 8 carbons (6 from the ring, 2 from the acetyl group), contains a carbonyl group, and has an aromatic-halogen bond.\n\n### 2. Analyze the 1H NMR Options\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given 1H NMR data options based on the predicted structure of a haloacetophenone. The substitution can be ortho, meta, or para. A common pattern in these problems involves the highly symmetric para (1,4) substitution.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The peak at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a ketone. A structure like p-halophenylacetaldehyde (X-C6H4-CH2CHO) would have 8 carbons. However, the aldehyde proton should be a triplet (split by the adjacent CH2 group), and the CH2 protons should be a doublet (split by the CHO proton). The data shows two singlets, which contradicts the expected splitting pattern.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum lacks signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm). Therefore, it cannot represent the described aromatic compound.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two doublets at 7.8 ppm and 7.6 ppm, each integrating to 2 protons, are a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two protons closer to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group are shifted further downfield (deshielded) compared to the two protons closer to the halogen.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** The singlet at 2.3 ppm, integrating to 3 protons, is in the typical chemical shift range for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl (an acetyl group).\n    *   This data perfectly matches the structure of a 4-haloacetophenone (e.g., 4-chloroacetophenone or 4-bromoacetophenone). For instance, the reported spectrum for 4-chloroacetophenone shows a singlet for the methyl group at ~2.6 ppm and two doublets for the aromatic protons at ~7.45 ppm and ~7.91 ppm. Similarly, 4-bromoacetophenone shows a methyl singlet at 2.60 ppm and aromatic signals around 7.62 ppm and 7.83 ppm. The values in option C are consistent with this structure.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum shows only one proton in the aromatic region, which is inconsistent with a di-substituted benzene ring (which would have 4 aromatic protons). The other signals are not in the expected regions for the proposed structure.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe 1H NMR data in option C is the only one that correctly corresponds to a di-substituted, 8-carbon aromatic compound containing a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. The structure is a 4-haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<C>>>"
