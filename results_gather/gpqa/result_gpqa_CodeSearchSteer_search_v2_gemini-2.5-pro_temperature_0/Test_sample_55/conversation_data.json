    "The decay of a hydrogen atom from the |3,0,0⟩ state to the |1,0,0⟩ state occurs via a two-step electric dipole transition, which necessitates passing through an intermediate state. The rules governing these transitions, known as selection rules, dictate how the quantum numbers n, l, and m can change.\n\n### Step 1: Transition from |3,0,0⟩ to an intermediate state\n\nThe initial state is |n=3, l=0, m=0⟩, commonly known as the 3s state. According to the electric dipole selection rules, for a transition to be allowed, the orbital angular momentum quantum number *l* must change by ±1 (Δl = ±1), and the magnetic quantum number *m* can change by 0 or ±1 (Δm = 0, ±1).\n\nApplying these rules to the initial state |3,0,0⟩:\n*   **Δl = ±1**: Since the initial *l* is 0, the intermediate state must have *l'* = 1.\n*   **Δm = 0, ±1**: Since the initial *m* is 0, the intermediate state can have *m'* = 0, 1, or -1.\n\nThe principal quantum number *n* must decrease for a decay. The options provided suggest an intermediate state with n=2. Therefore, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩. These correspond to the 2p subshell.\n\n### Step 2: Transition from the intermediate state to |1,0,0⟩\n\nAll three possible intermediate states |2,1,m'⟩ can transition to the final state |1,0,0⟩, as this step also satisfies the selection rules (Δl = 0-1 = -1, and Δm is 0 or ±1).\n\n### Calculating the Probability\n\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific transition route. This corresponds to the branching ratio for the first step of the decay. The initial state |3,0,0⟩ is spherically symmetric (since *l*=0). Due to this symmetry, there is no preferred direction for the emission of the photon. Consequently, the transitions to each of the possible intermediate states |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩ are equally probable.\n\nSince there are three equally likely decay channels from the |3,0,0⟩ state to the n=2, l=1 manifold, and these are the only allowed dipole transitions to the n=2 shell, the probability for each channel is 1/3.\n\nThe probability of the entire cascade is determined by this first step, as the subsequent decay from any |2,1,m'⟩ state to |1,0,0⟩ is the only path available and thus has a probability of 1.\n\nTherefore, the three possible decay routes and their probabilities are:\n*   |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with a probability of 1/3.\n*   |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with a probability of 1/3.\n*   |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with a probability of 1/3.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n*   A) |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and 1/4 (Incorrect probability)\n*   B) |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and 1/3 (Correct route and probability)\n*   C) |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and 1/4 (Incorrect probability)\n*   D) |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and 2/3 (Incorrect probability)\n\nThe correct choice is the one that presents a valid route with the calculated probability of 1/3.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$\n<<<B>>>"
