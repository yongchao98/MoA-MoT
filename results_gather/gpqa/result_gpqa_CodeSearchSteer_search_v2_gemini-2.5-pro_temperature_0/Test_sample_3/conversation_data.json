    "In our universe, one of the fundamental principles of magnetism is that magnetic poles always come in pairs (a north and a south). An isolated north or south pole, known as a magnetic monopole, has never been observed. This observation is embedded in Maxwell's Equations.\n\nIf we were in a parallel universe where magnetic monopoles did exist, two of Maxwell's equations would need to be modified to account for them.\n\n1.  **Gauss's Law for Magnetism (related to the divergence of the magnetic field):** In its standard form, this law states that the divergence of the magnetic field (∇ ⋅ B) is zero. This is the mathematical statement that there are no magnetic monopoles. If monopoles existed, they would act as sources or sinks of the magnetic field, much like electric charges do for the electric field. Therefore, this equation would change to show that the divergence of the magnetic field is proportional to the density of magnetic charge (ρm).\n\n2.  **Faraday's Law of Induction (related to the circulation of the electric field):** This law describes how a changing magnetic field creates a circulating electric field (∇ × E). In a universe with magnetic monopoles, the movement of these monopoles would constitute a \"magnetic current\" (Jm). To maintain the symmetry of electromagnetism, this magnetic current would also have to be a source for a circulating electric field, adding a new term to Faraday's Law.\n\nTherefore, the two equations that would be different are the one related to the divergence of the magnetic field and the one related to the circulation (or curl) of the electric field.\n\n<<<B>>>"
