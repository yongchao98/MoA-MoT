    "To determine which of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity, we need to identify which ones are chiral and not present as a racemic mixture. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of a stereocenter, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. A compound with stereocenters can still be achiral if it is a meso compound, meaning it has an internal plane of symmetry.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  ***(Z)***-**1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`. The carbons of the double bond (C1 and C2) are sp² hybridized and cannot be chiral centers. The other carbons in the molecule (C3, C4, and the methyl carbon) are bonded to at least two identical hydrogen atoms, so they are not chiral centers either. The molecule lacks any chiral center or other elements of chirality (like axial or planar chirality). Therefore, it is **achiral** and optically inactive.\n\n2.  ***(3aR,7aS,E)***-**8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The IUPAC name includes the stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. This indicates the presence of specific stereocenters at positions 3a and 7a. Since a specific enantiomer is named, the molecule is chiral. A pure sample of a single enantiomer is by definition **optically active**.\n\n3.  ***(2R,3S)***-**2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two stereocenters at C2 and C3. The substituents on C2 (H, CH₃, COOH, and the other half of the molecule) are identical to the substituents on C3. The given stereoisomer is `(2R,3S)`. When a molecule has two identical stereocenters with opposite configurations (R and S), it possesses an internal plane of symmetry. Such a compound is called a meso compound. Meso compounds are **achiral** and therefore optically inactive.\n\n4.  ***(2R,3R)***-**2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Here, both stereocenters have the same configuration `(2R,3R)`. This molecule lacks an internal plane of symmetry and is non-superimposable on its mirror image, which is the `(2S,3S)` isomer. Therefore, `(2R,3R)`-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is a chiral molecule. As a single enantiomer, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  ***(R)***-**cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The name includes the descriptor `(R)`, indicating a specific stereoisomer. The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond and a hydroxyl group. The carbon atom at position 1 is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group (-OH), a `-CH2-CH=` group (C2-C3), and a `-CH2-CH2-CH=` group (C6-C5-C4). Since C1 is a stereocenter and a specific enantiomer `(R)` is given, the compound is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n6.  ***(1s,3s,5s)***-**cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This is the all-*cis* isomer of cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring. The designation `(1s,3s,5s)` refers to the absolute configuration of the stereocenters, which could also be named `(1S,3S,5S)`. This molecule possesses a C₃ axis of symmetry but lacks any improper rotation axis (Sₙ) or a plane of symmetry. Molecules belonging to the C₃ point group are chiral. Since a specific enantiomer is designated, it is **optically active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`. Let's examine the molecule for stereocenters.\n    *   The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to a hydrogen atom, a methyl group (C4), another methyl group (the substituent), and a `-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl` group. The four groups are: H, CH₃, CH₃, and -CH₂-C(=O)-cyclopentyl. Wait, the parent chain is butan-1-one, and there is a methyl group at position 3. The structure is `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`. The carbon at position 3 is bonded to:\n        1.  H\n        2.  CH₃ (the methyl group that is C4)\n        3.  CH₃ (the methyl substituent)\n        4.  -CH₂-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl\n    This interpretation is incorrect. The correct interpretation is that C3 is attached to H, C4 (a methyl group), C2, and a methyl substituent. Let's re-examine the structure from the name: The parent chain is butan-1-one, which is a 4-carbon chain with a ketone at C1. A methyl group is at C3. So, the carbon skeleton is `C4-C3(CH3)-C2-C1`. The group attached to the carbonyl at C1 is a cyclopentyl ring. The full structure is `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`.\n    Let's check C3 for chirality. The four groups attached are:\n    1.  H\n    2.  CH₃ (C4)\n    3.  CH₃ (the methyl substituent)\n    4.  -CH₂-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl\n    This is still incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the structure. The parent chain is butan-1-one. The methyl group is at C3. The structure is `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-`. The group attached to the carbonyl is cyclopentyl. So the structure is `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`.\n    Let's check C3 again. It is attached to H, a methyl group, another methyl group, and the rest of the chain. This is wrong.\n    The correct structure for 3-methylbutane is isopentane. So, 3-methylbutan-1-one has the structure `(CH3)2CHCH2C(=O)-`. The carbon at position 3 is bonded to two methyl groups and is not a chiral center. No other carbon in the molecule is a chiral center. Therefore, the molecule is **achiral** and optically inactive.\n\nIn summary:\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: **Inactive**\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Inactive** (meso)\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: **Active**\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: **Inactive**\n\nThere are four compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<C>>>"
