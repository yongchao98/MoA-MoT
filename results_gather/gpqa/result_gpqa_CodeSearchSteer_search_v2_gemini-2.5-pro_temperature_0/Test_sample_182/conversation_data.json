    "To determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product, we must first identify the reactant and the product of the specified reaction.\n\n### 1. Reactant and its Structure\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Cyclohex-3-ene**: A six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4.\n*   **Carboxylic acid**: A -COOH group, which is at position 1.\n*   **2-formyl**: A -CHO (aldehyde) group at position 2.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A -CH=CH2 group at position 5.\n\nBased on this, the molecular formula of the reactant is C₁₀H₁₂O₃.\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) for the reactant can be calculated from its structure:\n*   1 for the ring.\n*   1 for the double bond in the cyclohexene ring.\n*   1 for the double bond in the vinyl group.\n*   1 for the carbonyl double bond in the formyl group.\n*   1 for the carbonyl double bond in the carboxylic acid group.\nTotal IHD for the reactant = 5.\n\n### 2. The Reaction\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus (Red P) and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI)**. This combination is a powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce various oxygen-containing functional groups completely to their corresponding alkanes.\n*   The **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)** will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The **formyl group (-CHO)** will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The reagent will also reduce carbon-carbon double bonds (**alkenes**) to single bonds (alkanes).\n\n### 3. Product and its Structure\n\nThe reaction will result in the following transformations:\n*   The cyclohex-3-ene ring becomes a **cyclohexane** ring.\n*   The carboxylic acid at C1 becomes a **methyl group**.\n*   The formyl group at C2 becomes a **methyl group**.\n*   The vinyl group at C5 becomes an **ethyl group** (-CH₂CH₃).\n\nThe carbon skeleton of the reactant (C₁₀) is preserved. The final product is a substituted cyclohexane. Based on the original numbering, the product is a cyclohexane ring with methyl groups at positions 1 and 2, and an ethyl group at position 5. The IUPAC name for this structure would be 1-ethyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohexane.\n\nThe molecular formula of the product is **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\n### 4. Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (also known as the degree of unsaturation) can be calculated using the formula for a hydrocarbon:\nIHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\n\nWhere:\n*   C is the number of carbon atoms.\n*   H is the number of hydrogen atoms.\n*   Oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation.\n\nFor the product C₁₀H₂₀:\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2)\nIHD = 11 - 10\nIHD = 1\n\nThis IHD value of 1 corresponds to the single ring structure of the cyclohexane in the final product.\n\nThus, the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<D>>>"
