    "To determine the energies of the system, we must first understand the behavior of the four identical spin-1/2 particles within the one-dimensional infinite potential well. These particles are fermions and therefore must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n\nThe energy levels for a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L are quantized and given by the formula:\nE_n = n² * (π²ħ² / 2mL²)\n\nThe problem defines the ground state energy unit as E = π²ħ² / 2mL². Thus, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as:\nE_n = n²E, where n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nFor spin-1/2 particles, each energy level 'n' can hold a maximum of two particles, one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n**Ground State Energy**\n\nTo find the ground state energy of the four-particle system, we fill the lowest available energy levels first.\n*   Two particles will occupy the n=1 energy level. The energy for these two particles is 2 * E₁ = 2 * (1²E) = 2E.\n*   The remaining two particles will occupy the n=2 energy level. The energy for these two particles is 2 * E₂ = 2 * (2²E) = 2 * 4E = 8E.\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\nE_ground = 2E + 8E = 10E.\n\n**First Excited State Energy**\n\nTo obtain the first excited state, we promote one particle from the highest occupied energy level in the ground state (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (n=3).\n*   The configuration becomes: two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n*   The total energy for this configuration is:\n    E_first = (2 * E₁) + (1 * E₂) + (1 * E₃)\n    E_first = (2 * 1²E) + (1 * 2²E) + (1 * 3²E)\n    E_first = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.\n\n**Second Excited State Energy**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest total energy above the first excited state. We must consider the possible single-particle promotions from the ground state that result in the lowest energy increase after the first excited state.\n*   **Possibility 1:** Promote a particle from n=2 to n=3 (as in the first excited state) and another from n=2 to n=3. This is not possible as it would mean exciting the same particle twice. A better way to think about it is exciting the second particle from n=2 to n=3. The configuration would be two particles in n=1 and two particles in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (2 * E₁) + (2 * E₃) = (2 * 1²E) + (2 * 3²E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n*   **Possibility 2:** Promote a particle from a lower level, n=1, to the lowest available level, n=3. The configuration would be one particle in n=1, two particles in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (1 * E₁) + (2 * E₂) + (1 * E₃)\n    *   Energy = (1 * 1²E) + (2 * 2²E) + (1 * 3²E)\n    *   Energy = E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n\nComparing the possible excitation energies (15E, 18E, 20E), the second lowest energy after the ground state is 18E.\n\nTherefore, the energies are:\n*   **Ground State:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State:** 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
