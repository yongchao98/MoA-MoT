    "Here is the step-by-step calculation to determine the mean decay distance of the X meson resonance.\n\n### 1. Understand the Key Concepts and Formulas\n\n*   **Mean Lifetime (τ):** The lifetime of a particle in its own rest frame (proper lifetime) is related to its decay width (Γ) by the uncertainty principle. The formula is:\n    τ = ħ / Γ\n    where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n*   **Time Dilation:** A moving particle's lifetime appears longer to a stationary observer. This is described by the Lorentz factor (γ). The lifetime in the lab frame (τ_lab) is:\n    τ_lab = γ * τ\n*   **Lorentz Factor (γ):** This factor relates the total energy (E) of a particle to its rest mass energy (mc²):\n    γ = E / mc²\n*   **Mean Decay Distance (d):** This is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying. It is its velocity (v) multiplied by its lifetime in the lab frame.\n    d = v * τ_lab = v * γ * τ\n    This can also be expressed using the relativistic momentum (p).\n    d = (p / m) * cτ = (pc / mc²) * (ħc / Γ)\n\n### 2. List the Given Values and Constants\n\n*   **Production Energy (E_X):** 8 GeV = 8000 MeV\n*   **Mass (m_X):** 1.2 GeV = 1200 MeV (This is the rest mass energy, mc²)\n*   **Width (Γ_X):** 320 MeV\n*   **Reduced Planck Constant times c (ħc):** A useful constant in particle physics is ħc ≈ 197.327 MeV·fm. (1 fm = 10⁻¹⁵ m)\n*   **Speed of Light (c):** Approximately 3 x 10⁸ m/s.\n\n### 3. Perform the Calculation\n\nWe will use the formula that combines these steps for better precision:\nd = (pc / mc²) * (ħc / Γ)\n\n**Step 3a: Calculate the momentum term (pc).**\nThe relativistic energy-momentum relation is E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n(8000 MeV)² = (pc)² + (1200 MeV)²\n64,000,000 MeV² = (pc)² + 1,440,000 MeV²\n(pc)² = 64,000,000 - 1,440,000 = 62,560,000 MeV²\npc = √62,560,000 MeV ≈ 7909.49 MeV\n\n**Step 3b: Calculate the proper decay length (cτ).**\ncτ = ħc / Γ\ncτ = (197.327 MeV·fm) / 320 MeV ≈ 0.6166 fm\n\n**Step 3c: Calculate the mean decay distance (d).**\nd = (pc / mc²) * (cτ)\nd = (7909.49 MeV / 1200 MeV) * 0.6166 fm\nd ≈ 6.5912 * 0.6166 fm\nd ≈ 4.0655 fm\n\nSince 1 femtometer (fm) is equal to 10⁻¹⁵ meters, the mean decay distance is:\nd ≈ 4.0655 x 10⁻¹⁵ m\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
