    "To calculate the enthalpy of formation of the given compound, we can use the principles of thermochemistry, specifically relating bond energies to enthalpy changes. The overall process can be broken down into the following steps:\n\n1.  **Determine the Molecular Formula:** First, we identify the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms in the molecule (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n    *   Carbon (C) atoms: 2 (in (CH3)2) + 1 (at C=) + 1 (in =CH-) + 1 (in -CH2-) + 2 (in -CH(CH3)-) + 1 (in -CH2-) + 1 (in -CH=) + 3 (in =C(CH3)2) = 12 carbon atoms.\n    *   Hydrogen (H) atoms: 6 (in (CH3)2) + 1 (in =CH-) + 2 (in -CH2-) + 4 (in -CH(CH3)-) + 2 (in -CH2-) + 1 (in -CH=) + 6 (in =C(CH3)2) = 22 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   The molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n2.  **Count the Chemical Bonds:** We need to determine the number of each type of bond in one mole of the substance. For an acyclic molecule like this one:\n    *   **C-H bonds:** The number of hydrogen atoms directly gives the number of C-H bonds, which is **22**.\n    *   **C=C bonds:** The structure clearly shows two carbon-carbon double bonds, so there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n    *   **C-C bonds:** For an acyclic molecule with 'n' carbon atoms, the total number of carbon-carbon bonds (single and multiple) is n-1. Here, n=12, so there are 11 total C-C framework bonds. Since 2 of these are double bonds, the number of single C-C bonds is 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound (ΔH_atomization):** This is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the compound into gaseous atoms. It is the sum of all the bond energies.\n    *   Energy to break C-H bonds = 22 mol * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n    *   Energy to break C-C bonds = 9 mol * 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n    *   Energy to break C=C bonds = 2 mol * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n    *   **ΔH_atomization** = 8800 + 1800 + 600 = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n4.  **Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation of Gaseous Atoms:** This is the energy required to produce all the constituent atoms in their gaseous state from their elements in their standard states (C(graphite) and H2(gas)).\n    *   For Carbon: 12 mol * ΔH_atomization(C) = 12 mol * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n    *   For Hydrogen: The bond energy of H-H is 100 kJ/mol, which corresponds to the reaction H2(g) → 2H(g). Therefore, the enthalpy of formation of 1 mole of H(g) is 100 / 2 = 50 kJ/mol.\n    *   Energy to form gaseous Hydrogen atoms = 22 mol * 50 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n    *   **Total enthalpy of formation of gaseous atoms** = 12000 + 1100 = **13100 kJ/mol**\n\n5.  **Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation of the Compound (ΔH_f):** The enthalpy of formation of the compound is the difference between the enthalpy of formation of the gaseous atoms and the enthalpy of atomization of the compound.\n    *   ΔH_f = (Enthalpy of formation of gaseous atoms) - (Enthalpy of atomization of the compound)\n    *   ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n6.  **Convert to kJ/g:** The options include answers in kJ/g, so we need to convert our result.\n    *   Molar mass of C12H22 = (12 * 12.0 g/mol) + (22 * 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n    *   ΔH_f in kJ/g = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.44 kJ/g**.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\n*   A) 11200 kJ/mol (This is the enthalpy of atomization)\n*   B) 1900 kJ/g (The numerical value is correct for kJ/mol, but the unit is wrong)\n*   C) 11.44 kJ/g (This matches our calculated value)\n*   D) 67.4 kJ/mol\n\nThe correct answer is 11.44 kJ/g.\n\n<<<C>>>"
