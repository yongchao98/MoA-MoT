    "To find the expectation value of the operator `10σ_z + 5σ_x`, we need to calculate `<ψ| (10σ_z + 5σ_x) |ψ>`, where `ψ` is the given spin state.\n\nThe state of the spin-half particle is given by the linear superposition:\n`|ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩`\n\nThe operator is:\n`O = 10σ_z + 5σ_x`\n\nThe expectation value `<O>` can be calculated as:\n`<O> = <ψ|O|ψ> = <ψ|(10σ_z + 5σ_x)|ψ>`\n\nUsing the linearity of the operator and the inner product, we can separate this into two parts:\n`<O> = 10<ψ|σ_z|ψ> + 5<ψ|σ_x|ψ>`\n\nThis is equivalent to calculating the expectation values of `σ_z` and `σ_x` separately and then combining them.\n\n**1. Representing the states and operators in matrix form:**\n\nIn the standard basis where `|↑⟩` and `|↓⟩` are the eigenstates of `σ_z`, we have:\n*   `|↑⟩` is represented by the column vector `[1, 0]`\n*   `|↓⟩` is represented by the column vector `[0, 1]`\n\nSo, the state `|ψ⟩` is:\n`|ψ⟩ = 0.5 * [1, 0] + (√3)/2 * [0, 1] = [0.5, (√3)/2]`\n\nThe corresponding bra `⟨ψ|` is the conjugate transpose:\n`⟨ψ| = [0.5, (√3)/2]`\n\nThe Pauli matrices are:\n*   `σ_z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`\n*   `σ_x = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\n\n**2. Calculate the expectation value of σ_z (<σ_z>):**\n\nThe expectation value of `σ_z` for a general state `a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩` is given by `|a|² - |b|²`.\nIn our case, `a = 0.5` and `b = (√3)/2`.\n`<σ_z> = (0.5)² - ((√3)/2)² = 0.25 - 3/4 = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5`\n\n**3. Calculate the expectation value of σ_x (<σ_x>):**\n\nWe calculate this using matrix multiplication: `<σ_x> = <ψ|σ_x|ψ>`.\nFirst, let's find `σ_x|ψ⟩`:\n`σ_x|ψ⟩ = [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * [0.5, (√3)/2] = [(√3)/2, 0.5]`\n\nNow, we multiply by `⟨ψ|`:\n`<σ_x> = [0.5, (√3)/2] * [(√3)/2, 0.5] = (0.5 * (√3)/2) + ((√3)/2 * 0.5) = (√3)/4 + (√3)/4 = 2(√3)/4 = (√3)/2`\n\nUsing the approximation `√3 ≈ 1.732`:\n`<σ_x> ≈ 1.732 / 2 = 0.866`\n\n**4. Combine the results to find the final expectation value:**\n\n`<O> = 10<σ_z> + 5<σ_x>`\n`<O> = 10 * (-0.5) + 5 * ((√3)/2)`\n`<O> = -5 + 2.5 * √3`\n`<O> ≈ -5 + 2.5 * 1.732`\n`<O> ≈ -5 + 4.33`\n`<O> ≈ -0.67`\n\n**5. Round to one decimal place:**\n\nRounding the result to one decimal place gives -0.7.\n\n<<<D>>>"
