    "To determine which exoplanet has the highest density, we must analyze the physical principles governing planetary mass, radius, and composition.\n\nFirst, let's establish a baseline with the known properties of Earth.\n*   **Planet (a)** is described as an Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. Its density is therefore the density of Earth, which is approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n*   **Planet (b)** is described as having 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³, which is nearly identical to Earth's density.\n\nNext, we consider the effect of mass on planets with the same composition. For terrestrial (rocky) planets, a more massive planet exerts a stronger gravitational force on its own material. This increased gravity compresses the planet's matter, including its iron core and silicate mantle, into a smaller volume than it would otherwise occupy. This phenomenon, known as gravitational compression, results in a higher overall density.\n\n*   **Planet (c)** has the same composition as Earth but is 5 times more massive. Due to its significantly greater mass, it will experience much stronger gravitational compression. This compression will squeeze its materials more tightly, leading to a density substantially higher than Earth's. For rocky planets, as mass increases, density also increases.\n*   **Planet (d)** has the same composition as Earth but only half the mass. With weaker gravity, its materials would be less compressed than Earth's. Consequently, its density would be lower than Earth's.\n\nComparing the options:\n*   Density of (a) ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n*   Density of (b) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n*   Density of (c) > 5.51 g/cm³ (due to significant gravitational compression)\n*   Density of (d) < 5.51 g/cm³ (due to less gravitational compression)\n\nTherefore, the planet with 5 Earth masses and the same composition as Earth will be the densest.\n\n<<<B>>>"
