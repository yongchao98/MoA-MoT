    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the determination of the number of hydrogen signals in the final product.\n\n### **Reaction Sequence Analysis**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n    *   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH₃COOH), bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride.\n    *   **Reaction:** This set of reagents is used for the alpha-bromination of the carboxylic acid. This is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction.\n    *   **Product 1:** 2-Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n    *   **Reactants:** Product 1 (BrCH₂COOH), ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH), and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a classic Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl 2-bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n    *   **Reactants:** Product 2 (Ethyl 2-bromoacetate), and sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) displaces the bromide ion (Br⁻).\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl 2-cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n    *   **Reactants:** Product 3 (Ethyl 2-cyanoacetate), excess sodium hydride (NaH), and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH₂)₅Br).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a sequential deprotonation and alkylation process.\n        *   First, NaH, a strong base, removes an acidic α-proton from ethyl 2-cyanoacetate to form an enolate.\n        *   This enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromide ion.\n        *   The use of *excess* NaH ensures that the second, and now only, α-proton is also removed, creating a new enolate.\n        *   This new enolate undergoes a rapid intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction (a Thorpe-Ziegler type cyclization), attacking the other end of the pentyl chain to displace the second bromide ion. This forms a stable six-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 4:** The final product is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n### **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis of Product 4**\n\nThe structure of Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring substituted at the C1 position with both a cyano (-CN) group and an ethoxycarbonyl (-COOCH₂CH₃) group.\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the chemical equivalence of the protons in the molecule.\n\n1.  **Symmetry:** The two substituents on C1, cyano and ethoxycarbonyl, are different in terms of size and electronic properties. Therefore, the molecule is asymmetric and does not possess a plane of symmetry. The C1 carbon is a chiral center, and the product is a racemic mixture.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   Because there is no plane of symmetry, the two sides of the ring are not equivalent. This means that the protons on C2 are not equivalent to the protons on C6, and the protons on C3 are not equivalent to the protons on C5.\n    *   Furthermore, in a substituted cyclohexane ring, the two protons on any given methylene (CH₂) group (the axial and equatorial protons) are diastereotopic and thus chemically non-equivalent.\n    *   Therefore, all ten protons on the cyclohexane ring are chemically distinct.\n        *   C2: 2 distinct protons (axial and equatorial).\n        *   C3: 2 distinct protons (axial and equatorial).\n        *   C4: 2 distinct protons (axial and equatorial).\n        *   C5: 2 distinct protons (axial and equatorial).\n        *   C6: 2 distinct protons (axial and equatorial).\n    *   This gives a total of **10 signals** from the ring protons.\n\n3.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃) Protons:**\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-CH₃):** The three protons of the terminal methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation around the carbon-carbon bond. They will produce **1 signal**.\n    *   **Methylene Protons (-OCH₂-):** These two protons are adjacent to the ester oxygen and beta to the chiral center at C1. Protons that are adjacent to a chiral center are typically diastereotopic and chemically non-equivalent. However, in multiple-choice questions of this nature, it is a common simplification to consider them equivalent if they are not part of a rigid ring structure, as their chemical shift difference might be negligible. If we apply this simplification, these two protons give rise to **1 signal**.\n\n### **Total Number of Signals**\n\nSumming the signals from all parts of the molecule based on the analysis above:\n*   Ring Protons: 10 signals\n*   Ethyl Methylene Protons (-OCH₂-): 1 signal (with simplification)\n*   Ethyl Methyl Protons (-CH₃): 1 signal\n\nTotal Signals = 10 + 1 + 1 = 12.\n\nThis corresponds to option B. If the diastereotopic nature of the -OCH₂- protons were strictly considered, the total would be 13, which is not an option. If the ring were assumed to be symmetric (a chemically inaccurate simplification), the answer would be 8 (Option A). The most chemically sound interpretation that matches an available option is 12.\n\n<<<B>>>"
