    "To find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star 1 and Star 2, we first need to determine the silicon abundance relative to hydrogen for each star. The standard astronomical notation `[A/B]` represents the logarithmic abundance ratio of elements A and B in a star compared to the Sun:\n\n`[A/B] = log10( (n_A / n_B)_star ) - log10( (n_A / n_B)_sun )`\n\nwhere `n_A` and `n_B` are the number densities of the respective elements. A useful identity derived from this definition is `[A/B] = [A/H] - [B/H]`.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the silicon abundance for Star 1**\n\nFor Star 1, we are given:\n*   `[Fe/H]_1 = 0`\n*   `[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3`\n\nUsing the identity `[A/B] = [A/H] - [B/H]`, we can write:\n`[Si/Fe]_1 = [Si/H]_1 - [Fe/H]_1`\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n`0.3 = [Si/H]_1 - 0`\nTherefore, `[Si/H]_1 = 0.3`\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the silicon abundance for Star 2**\n\nFor Star 2, we are given:\n*   `[Mg/H]_2 = 0`\n*   `[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3`\n\nUsing the same identity:\n`[Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2`\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n`0.3 = 0 - [Si/H]_2`\nTherefore, `[Si/H]_2 = -0.3`\n\n**Step 3: Determine the ratio of silicon abundances**\n\nThe question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres, which is interpreted as the ratio of their abundances relative to hydrogen: `(n_Si / n_H)_1 / (n_Si / n_H)_2`.\n\nFrom the definition of `[Si/H]`, we have:\n`[Si/H]_1 = log10( (n_Si / n_H)_1 ) - log10( (n_Si / n_H)_sun )`\n`[Si/H]_2 = log10( (n_Si / n_H)_2 ) - log10( (n_Si / n_H)_sun )`\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the first gives:\n`[Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 = log10( (n_Si / n_H)_1 ) - log10( (n_Si / n_H)_2 )`\n`[Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 = log10( (n_Si / n_H)_1 / (n_Si / n_H)_2 )`\n\nNow, we can solve for the ratio:\nRatio = `(n_Si / n_H)_1 / (n_Si / n_H)_2 = 10^([Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2)`\n\nPlugging in the values we found:\nRatio = `10^(0.3 - (-0.3)) = 10^0.6`\n\nCalculating the final value:\nRatio â‰ˆ 3.981\n\nThis value is approximately 3.9. The information regarding the stellar masses and the specific solar abundances of iron and magnesium were not necessary for this calculation.\n\n<<<A>>>"
