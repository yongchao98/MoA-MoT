    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### 1. Analysis of FTIR Spectrum\n\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The significant broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules. This peak's center is in the same region as C-H stretching, but its broad nature is the key identifier.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. Combined with the broad O-H peak, this strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group, which typically shows a C=O stretch between 1690-1760 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the compound is an alkene.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The data points to an unsaturated carboxylic acid, meaning the molecule contains a -COOH group and a C=C double bond.\n\n### 2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the ¹H NMR spectrum confirms the existence of an alkene functional group, which supports the conclusion from the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n### 3. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids, corresponding to the mass of the [COOH]⁺ fragment (Mass = 12 for C + (2 * 16 for O) + 1 for H = 45). This provides strong evidence for the carboxylic acid group.\n\n### 4. Determining the Chemical Formula\n\nBased on the combined spectral data, the unknown compound must contain:\n*   Two oxygen atoms (from the carboxylic acid group, -COOH). This eliminates options C (C₆H₁₂O) and D (C₆H₁₀O).\n*   At least one degree of unsaturation from a C=C double bond, in addition to the degree of unsaturation from the C=O bond in the carboxylic acid.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the remaining options by calculating their **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**. The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula for a compound with C, H, and O is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₀O₂:**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = 2.\n    *   A DoU of 2 is consistent with the presence of one C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid) and one C=C double bond (from the alkene). This perfectly matches all the spectral evidence.\n\n*   **B) C₆H₁₂O₂:**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = 1.\n    *   A DoU of 1 can only account for the one C=O double bond of the carboxylic acid. It does not allow for the additional C=C double bond confirmed by both FTIR and ¹H NMR.\n\n**Final Conclusion:** The only molecular formula that fits all the characterization data is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>"
