    "Here is a breakdown of the observations and an analysis of the provided options:\n\n### Analysis of Observations\n\n1.  **1H NMR Spectrum:** The key observation is the presence of two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton. These peaks have similar chemical shifts and their combined integral is correct (1H). This indicates the presence of two different chemical environments for that specific proton, in roughly equal amounts. Since spin-spin coupling is ruled out, the cause must be isomeric.\n2.  **LC-MS Analysis:** The liquid chromatography (LC) separates two components, which appear as two distinct peaks of equal intensity. This confirms the presence of two different species in a ~1:1 ratio that are separable under the LC conditions. The mass spectrometry (MS) shows that both peaks have the same mass, which matches the expected mass of the target molecule. This proves the two species are isomers of each other.\n\n### Evaluation of the Options\n\n*   **A) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** \"Double coupling\" is a synthetic strategy to drive a reaction to completion. It aims to produce more of the *single, desired product*, not a mixture of isomers. This option does not explain the presence of two distinct isomeric compounds.\n\n*   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, enantiomers are indistinguishable and give the exact same spectrum. To see separate peaks, a chiral solvent or a chiral derivatizing agent would be required, which is not mentioned. Therefore, this option is inconsistent with the NMR data.\n\n*   **C) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor from the synthesis would have a different chemical structure and, therefore, a different molecular weight. The LC-MS data clearly shows both peaks have the *same mass* as the expected product, ruling out contamination by a precursor.\n\n*   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have different physical and chemical properties.\n    *   **Formation:** In peptide synthesis, diastereomers can form if one of the chiral centers (an alpha-carbon) undergoes epimerization (inversion of stereochemistry) during the coupling reaction. This is a known side reaction in peptide synthesis.\n    *   **NMR:** Because diastereomers are chemically distinct, they give different NMR spectra in a standard achiral solvent. It is expected that corresponding protons, like the alpha-proton in question, would have different (though often similar) chemical shifts, leading to two separate peaks.\n    *   **LC-MS:** Due to their different physical properties, diastereomers can be separated by standard (achiral) liquid chromatography. The observation of two peaks with the same mass is perfectly consistent with a mixture of diastereomers.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe presence of two species that are isomers (same mass) but are separable by standard LC and distinguishable by standard NMR can only be explained by the presence of diastereomers. This is a common issue in chemical peptide synthesis due to the risk of epimerization at one of the amino acid alpha-carbons.\n\n<<<D>>>"
