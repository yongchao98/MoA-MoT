    "Based on the principles of named chemical reactions, the reactants for the two transformations can be identified.\n\n**Reaction A: A + H2SO4 ---> 2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-one**\n\nThis reaction is a classic example of a **Pinacol Rearrangement** (or a related Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement). This type of reaction involves the acid-catalyzed rearrangement of a 1,2-diol (also known as a vicinal diol or glycol). The process begins with the protonation of one of the hydroxyl groups by the acid (H2SO4), which then leaves as a water molecule to form a carbocation. This is followed by a 1,2-alkyl shift, where an alkyl group from the adjacent carbon migrates to the carbocation center. This rearrangement leads to the formation of a more stable intermediate, which upon deprotonation yields a ketone. The conversion of a bicyclic diol, such as a decalin-diol, into a spirocyclic ketone is a known application of this rearrangement. Therefore, the correct starting material (A) must be the diol.\n\n*   **Reactant A is 2,7-dimethyloctahydronaphthalene-4a,8a-diol.**\n\n**Reaction B: B + BuLi + H+ ---> 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol**\n\nThis reaction describes a **-Wittig Rearrangement**. This is a named reaction that converts an allyl ether into a homoallylic alcohol using a strong base like butyllithium (BuLi), followed by an acidic workup (H+). The base deprotonates the carbon atom adjacent (alpha) to the ether's oxygen, creating a carbanion. This intermediate then undergoes a concerted-sigmatropic shift to form an alkoxide, which is then protonated during the workup to give the final alcohol product. Given the reagents and the class of the product (a homoallylic alcohol), the starting material (B) must be an ether.\n\n*   **Reactant B is (((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene**, which is also known as benzyl prenyl ether.\n\nThe alternative, where reactant B is the ketone (4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-one), is incorrect because its reaction with BuLi would result in the addition of a butyl group to the carbonyl carbon, not the observed reduction to an alcohol.\n\nCombining these findings, the correct pair of reactants is the diol for reaction A and the ether for reaction B.\n\n<<<A>>>"
