    "The analysis of the reaction between saturated epoxides and organocuprates, such as lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi), is based on well-established principles of organic chemistry. The reaction proceeds via an SN2 mechanism, which dictates both the regioselectivity and stereoselectivity of the product.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction:\n\n1.  **Reactants**:\n    *   **Epoxide**: (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a bicyclic structure containing a cyclohexane ring fused to an epoxide ring. The stereochemistry of the chiral centers is specified.\n    *   **Nucleophile**: Lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi), often called a Gilman reagent, serves as a source for a soft methyl nucleophile (Me‚Åª).\n\n2.  **Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)**: The prompt correctly states that the alkyl group of the organocuprate attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\n    *   The epoxide ring is formed between carbons C1 and C6 of the bicycloheptane structure.\n    *   C1 is a tertiary carbon, as it is bonded to a methyl group.\n    *   C6 is a secondary carbon, bonded to a hydrogen atom.\n    *   Therefore, the incoming methyl nucleophile will attack the less hindered C6.\n\n3.  **Stereoselectivity (3D Arrangement)**: The reaction is an SN2 substitution. This type of reaction is known to proceed with an inversion of configuration at the carbon atom that is attacked.\n    *   The initial configuration at the site of attack, C6, is (S).\n    *   Following the SN2 attack by the methyl group, the configuration at this carbon will be inverted to (R).\n    *   The configurations of the other stereocenters (C1, C3, and C4), which are not directly involved in the bond-breaking or bond-forming steps of the nucleophilic attack, are retained.\n\n4.  **Product Formation**:\n    *   The attack of the methyl group on C6 breaks the C6-O bond of the epoxide.\n    *   An alkoxide intermediate is formed, with the oxygen still attached to C1.\n    *   A subsequent acidic workup (a standard procedure in such reactions) protonates the alkoxide, yielding a hydroxyl (-OH) group at C1.\n    *   The final product is a substituted cyclohexanol.\n\n5.  **Structure and IUPAC Name of the Product**:\n    *   The resulting molecule is a cyclohexane ring with four methyl groups and one hydroxyl group.\n    *   According to IUPAC nomenclature, the carbon bearing the principal functional group (the -OH) is designated as C1. This corresponds to the original C1 of the starting material.\n    *   The new methyl group is on the adjacent carbon, which was C6 in the starting material and is now C2.\n    *   The other original methyl groups are located at positions that correspond to the new C4 and C5.\n    *   Thus, the product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n    *   The stereochemistry of the final product is determined as follows:\n        *   **New C1** (from old C1): Configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n        *   **New C2** (from old C6): Configuration is inverted from (S) to **(R)**.\n        *   **New C4** (from old C4): Configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n        *   **New C5** (from old C3): Configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n\nCombining these pieces, the final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
