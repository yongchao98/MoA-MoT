    "The search results confirm the physics principles I used.\n\n*   **Time Dilation:** The lifetime of a moving particle is dilated by the Lorentz factor, γ. The lab-frame lifetime is `t_lab = γ * t_proper`.\n*   **Decay Length:** The average distance a particle travels before decaying is its velocity multiplied by its lab-frame lifetime. For ultra-relativistic particles (v ≈ c), the decay length is `L = c * t_lab = c * γ * t_proper`.\n*   **Survival Probability:** The probability (or fraction) of a particle surviving for a time `t` in the lab frame is given by the exponential decay law: `P(t) = exp(-t / (γ * τ))`, where τ is the proper mean lifetime. This is the exact formula I derived and used.\n\nSome sources mention quantum mechanical corrections and deviations from the simple exponential decay law, especially at very short or very long times. However, the problem is framed as a standard relativity problem, and the provided options are single numerical values, implying that the standard, widely-used formula is expected. The problem states the particles are \"fast-decaying,\" and the survival fractions are significant (1/3 and 2/3), which places us in the exponential decay regime where the standard formula is highly accurate.\n\nThe calculation steps are confirmed to be correct. I will now formulate the final answer based on my initial derivation.\n\nTo solve this problem, we use the formula for the survival probability of a relativistic particle, which follows an exponential decay law.\n\nThe fraction of particles, `f`, that survive after traveling a distance `d` is given by:\n`f = exp(-d / (γ * v * τ))`\nwhere:\n*   `d` is the distance traveled (the detector radius, 30 m).\n*   `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n*   `v` is the particle's velocity. Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light, `c`.\n*   `τ` is the proper mean lifetime of the particle in its own rest frame.\n\nThe term `c * τ` represents the particle's proper decay length, which is a constant for a given type of particle. Let's call it `L_p`. The formula becomes:\n`f = exp(-d / (γ * L_p))`\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first scenario to find the proper decay length (`L_p`).**\n\nWe are given:\n*   Detector radius, `d = 30 m`\n*   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`\n*   Fraction of particles reaching the detector, `f₁ = 1/3`\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n`1/3 = exp(-30 / (20 * L_p))`\n\nTo solve for `L_p`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * L_p)`\n`-ln(3) = -1.5 / L_p`\n`L_p = 1.5 / ln(3)`\n\n**Step 2: Use the proper decay length to analyze the second scenario.**\n\nWe need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`, required for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector.\n\nWe are given:\n*   Detector radius, `d = 30 m`\n*   Fraction of particles reaching the detector, `f₂ = 2/3`\n\nThe equation for this scenario is:\n`2/3 = exp(-30 / (γ₂ * L_p))`\n\nTake the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(2/3) = -30 / (γ₂ * L_p)`\n\nNow, substitute the expression for `L_p` we found in Step 1:\n`ln(2/3) = -30 / (γ₂ * (1.5 / ln(3)))`\n`ln(2/3) = (-30 * ln(3)) / (1.5 * γ₂)`\n`ln(2/3) = -20 * ln(3) / γ₂`\n\nNow, we solve for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = -20 * ln(3) / ln(2/3)`\nUsing the logarithm property `ln(a/b) = ln(a) - ln(b)` and `ln(a/b) = -ln(b/a)`:\n`γ₂ = -20 * ln(3) / -ln(3/2)`\n`γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the numerical value.**\n\nUsing the approximate values for the natural logarithms:\n*   `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986`\n*   `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`\n\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * 1.0986 / 0.4055`\n`γ₂ ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055`\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.185`\n\nThis value is very close to 54.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 68\nB) 54\nC) 28\nD) 40\n\nThe calculated Lorentz factor of approximately 54 matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
