    "This problem can be solved by applying the principles of radioactive decay, which is an exponential process. A key feature of this process is that it is \"memoryless,\" meaning the probability of decay in a future interval is independent of how long the atom has already survived.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Determine the Decay Constant (λ):** The probability that a nucleus will not decay (survive) over a time `t` is given by the formula `P_survival = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant. We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%.\n    *   Probability of decay in 100 min: `P_decay(100) = 0.32`\n    *   Therefore, the probability of survival in 100 min is: `P_survival(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n    *   Using the survival formula: `0.68 = e^(-λ * 100)`\n    *   To find `λ`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides: `ln(0.68) = -100λ`\n    *   Solving for `λ`: `λ = -ln(0.68) / 100`\n\n2.  **Apply the Memoryless Property:** The problem states that 50 minutes have passed without decay. Because radioactive decay is a memoryless process, this information does not affect the atom's future decay probability. We can therefore calculate the probability of decay for the next 150 minutes as if we were starting from time zero.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Probability of Decay for the Next 150 Minutes:** We need to find the probability that the atom decays in a 150-minute interval.\n    *   First, calculate the probability of survival over 150 minutes: `P_survival(150) = e^(-λ * 150)`\n    *   Substitute the expression for `λ` we found in the first step:\n        `P_survival(150) = e^([-ln(0.68) / 100] * -150)`\n        `P_survival(150) = e^(ln(0.68) * 1.5)`\n    *   Using the logarithmic identity `e^(ln(x)*y) = x^y`, we get:\n        `P_survival(150) = (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607`\n    *   The probability of decay is 1 minus the probability of survival:\n        `P_decay(150) = 1 - P_survival(150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`\n\nThe calculated probability is approximately 0.4393, or 43.93%. This is closest to 44%.\n\n<<<A>>>"
