    "To determine the energy at which high-energy Î³-rays have their lifetimes limited by pair production with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons, we need to calculate the threshold energy for the reaction $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$.\n\n### Physical Principle\n\nThe creation of an electron-positron pair from two photons is governed by the principles of special relativity, specifically the conservation of four-momentum. The threshold energy is the minimum energy required for the reaction to occur. This minimum corresponds to the case where the electron and positron are created with no kinetic energy in the center-of-mass frame.\n\nFor a head-on collision between a high-energy photon of energy $E_{\\gamma}$ and a low-energy CMB photon of energy $E_{CMB}$, the threshold condition is given by the formula:\n\n$E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$\n\nwhere $m_e c^2$ is the rest mass energy of an electron.\n\n### Given Values\n\n*   **Average photon energy of the CMB ($E_{CMB}$):** $10^{-3}$ eV\n*   **Rest mass energy of an electron ($m_e c^2$):** The established value for the rest mass energy of an electron is approximately 0.511 MeV.\n\n### Calculation\n\nFirst, we need to express all energy values in the same unit, typically electron-volts (eV).\n\n1.  **Convert the electron's rest mass energy to eV:**\n    $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$\n\n2.  **Substitute the values into the threshold energy formula:**\n    $E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n\n3.  **Calculate the square of the electron's rest mass energy:**\n    $(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2 = 0.261121 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2$\n\n4.  **Divide by the CMB photon energy:**\n    $E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} = 0.261121 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}$\n\n5.  **Convert the result to Giga-electron-volts (GeV) for comparison with the options:**\n    Since $1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$:\n    $E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}} = 0.261121 \\times 10^6 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n6.  **Express in scientific notation:**\n    $E_{\\gamma} \\approx 2.61 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated threshold energy for the gamma-ray is approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5$ GeV. Comparing this result with the given options:\n\n*   A) 2.6 * 1e5 GeV\n*   B) 9.5 * 1e4 GeV\n*   C) 1.8 * 1e5 GeV\n*   D) 3.9 * 1e5 GeV\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
