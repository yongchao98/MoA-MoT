    "To determine the approximate ratio of neutrino fluxes, we must first understand the sources of solar neutrinos in the specified energy bands and how they are affected by the hypothetical shutdown of the pp-III branch.\n\n### Solar Neutrino Sources and Energies\n\nThe Sun produces neutrinos through several nuclear reaction pathways:\n\n*   **Proton-Proton (pp) Chain:** This is the dominant energy source in the Sun and has three main branches (pp-I, pp-II, pp-III).\n    *   **pp-I and pp-II:** These branches produce low-energy `pp` neutrinos (up to ~420 keV) and two mono-energetic lines of `⁷Be` neutrinos. About 90% of these `⁷Be` neutrinos have an energy of **861 keV**, with the remaining 10% at 383 keV.\n    *   **pp-III:** This branch is a minor contributor to the Sun's total energy but is the source of the highest-energy neutrinos. It produces `⁸B` (Boron-8) neutrinos, which have a continuous energy spectrum extending up to about 15 MeV.\n*   **CNO Cycle:** This cycle contributes about 1% of the Sun's energy and produces neutrinos from the decay of `¹³N` and `¹⁵O`. These neutrinos have continuous energy spectra that extend up to about 1.20 MeV and 1.73 MeV, respectively.\n\n### Analyzing the Hypothetical Scenario\n\nThe problem states that the **pp-III branch suddenly stops**. This means the production of `⁸B` neutrinos ceases entirely. All other reactions, including the pp-I, pp-II, and CNO cycle, continue as normal.\n\nNow, let's analyze the neutrino flux in the two specified energy bands *after* this change:\n\n*   **Flux (Band 1: 700-800 keV):**\n    *   The `⁸B` neutrinos, which would normally contribute to this band, are now gone.\n    *   The `⁷Be` neutrino line is at 861 keV, which is outside this band.\n    *   The only remaining sources of neutrinos in this energy range are from the **CNO cycle** (`¹³N` and `¹⁵O` neutrinos). The flux from the CNO cycle is relatively low.\n\n*   **Flux (Band 2: 800-900 keV):**\n    *   The `⁸B` neutrino contribution is gone.\n    *   This band is now overwhelmingly dominated by the strong, mono-energetic **`⁷Be` neutrino line at 861 keV**, which originates from the unaffected pp-II branch.\n    *   There is also a very small contribution from CNO neutrinos in this range.\n\n### Calculating the Flux Ratio\n\nWe need to find the ratio: Flux (700-800 keV) / Flux (800-900 keV).\n\n*   **Numerator:** The flux in Band 1 consists only of the relatively low flux from CNO neutrinos.\n*   **Denominator:** The flux in Band 2 is dominated by the very high flux of `⁷Be` neutrinos.\n\nThe total flux of all CNO neutrinos is roughly one-tenth of the flux of the 861 keV `⁷Be` neutrinos. However, the numerator (Band 1) only contains a fraction of the total CNO flux, while the denominator (Band 2) contains the entire `⁷Be` flux.\n\nTherefore, the ratio will be a small number, significantly less than 0.1. Comparing the relative flux values from solar models, the CNO flux in the 700-800 keV range is about two orders of magnitude smaller than the `⁷Be` flux at 861 keV. This leads to a ratio on the order of 1/100.\n\nThe ratio is approximately:\n(Low CNO Flux) / (High `⁷Be` Flux) ≈ 0.01\n\n<<<C>>>"
