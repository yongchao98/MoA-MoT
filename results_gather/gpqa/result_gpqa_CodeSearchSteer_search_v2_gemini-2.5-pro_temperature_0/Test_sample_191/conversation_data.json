    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the physics problem:\n\n1.  **Charge Induction:** When a positive charge `+q` is placed inside the cavity of the neutral spherical conductor, it attracts the free electrons within the conductor. This causes a negative charge of `-q` to accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity.\n2.  **Conservation of Charge:** Since the conductor was initially uncharged, the accumulation of `-q` on the inner surface leaves a net positive charge of `+q` on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding (Faraday Cage Effect):** A fundamental property of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium is that the electric field inside the material of the conductor is zero. This means the charges on the outer surface are \"shielded\" from the charge `+q` inside the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the inner surface. Consequently, the distribution of the `+q` charge on the outer surface is not affected by the position of the charge or the cavity inside.\n4.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** Because the outer surface of the conductor is a sphere, the `+q` charge will distribute itself uniformly over this surface to minimize potential energy.\n5.  **Electric Field Outside the Conductor:** According to Gauss's Law, the electric field at any point outside a uniformly charged sphere is identical to the field that would be produced if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere.\n6.  **Calculating the Field at Point P:** The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`. The point P is located at a distance `L` from the center of the spherical conductor. Therefore, the electric field at P is calculated as if there were a point charge `+q` at the conductor's center.\n\nThe magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is given by Coulomb's Law:\n\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThe information regarding the cavity's radius `r`, its distance `s` from the center, the distance `l`, and the angle `Î¸` is extraneous to the problem of finding the electric field *outside* the conductor.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
