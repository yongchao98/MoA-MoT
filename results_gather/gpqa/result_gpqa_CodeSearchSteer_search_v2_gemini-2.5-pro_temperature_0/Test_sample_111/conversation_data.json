    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n**1. Normalize the state |α>**\n\nThe given state is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Let's call the unnormalized state |ψ>:\n|ψ> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>\n\nTo normalize it, we need to find the normalization constant N such that the normalized state |α> = N|ψ> satisfies <α|α> = 1.\n\nThe inner product <ψ|ψ> is calculated as:\n<ψ|ψ> = <(1+i)up + (2-i)down | (1+i)up + (2-i)down>\n= (1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i)\n= (1² - i²) + (2² - i²)\n= (1 - (-1)) + (4 - (-1))\n= 2 + 5 = 7\n\nThe normalization constant N is therefore 1/√(<ψ|ψ>) = 1/√7.\n\nThe normalized state is:\n|α> = (1/√7) * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]\n\nIn vector notation, where |up> =ᵀ and |down> =ᵀ, the state is:\n|α> = (1/√7) * [ (1+i), (2-i) ]ᵀ\n\n**2. Define the operator A and find its eigenvalues and eigenstates**\n\nThe operator A is given by the matrix elements Aij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. For a 2-state system (spin up and down), this is a 2x2 matrix:\nA = [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]] = (ħ/2) * [,]\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (λ), we solve the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0:\ndet([[ -λ, ħ/2 ], [ ħ/2, -λ ]]) = 0\n(-λ)(-λ) - (ħ/2)(ħ/2) = 0\nλ² - (ħ/2)² = 0\nλ = ± ħ/2\n\nThe eigenvalues are λ₁ = +ħ/2 and λ₂ = -ħ/2.\n\nNow, we find the corresponding normalized eigenstates:\n*   For λ₁ = +ħ/2:\n    (A - λ₁I)v₁ = 0\n    [[ -ħ/2, ħ/2 ], [ ħ/2, -ħ/2 ]] * [[a], [b]] = 0\n    This gives -a + b = 0, so a = b. The unnormalized eigenstate isᵀ.\n    The normalized eigenstate is |v₁> = (1/√2) *ᵀ = (1/√2) * (|up> + |down>).\n\n*   For λ₂ = -ħ/2:\n    (A - λ₂I)v₂ = 0\n    [[ ħ/2, ħ/2 ], [ ħ/2, ħ/2 ]] * [[a], [b]] = 0\n    This gives a + b = 0, so a = -b. The unnormalized eigenstate is [1, -1]ᵀ.\n    The normalized eigenstate is |v₂> = (1/√2) * [1, -1]ᵀ = (1/√2) * (|up> - |down>).\n\n**3. Calculate the probabilities**\n\nThe probability of measuring the system in an eigenstate |vᵢ> is given by Pᵢ = |<vᵢ|α>|².\n\n*   Probability P₁ (of measuring λ₁ = +ħ/2):\n    <v₁|α> = [(1/√2) * (<up| + <down|)] * [(1/√7) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]\n    = (1/√14) * [1*(1+i) + 1*(2-i)]\n    = (1/√14) * (1 + i + 2 - i) = 3/√14\n    P₁ = |3/√14|² = 9/14 ≈ 0.643\n\n*   Probability P₂ (of measuring λ₂ = -ħ/2):\n    <v₂|α> = [(1/√2) * (<up| - <down|)] * [(1/√7) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]\n    = (1/√14) * [1*(1+i) - 1*(2-i)]\n    = (1/√14) * (1 + i - 2 + i) = (-1 + 2i)/√14\n    P₂ = |(-1 + 2i)/√14|² = ((-1)² + 2²)/14 = (1+4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.357\n\nThe probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.\n\n**4. Calculate the average value**\n\nThe average (or expectation) value of the operator A is given by <A> = <α|A|α>. It can also be calculated as the sum of the eigenvalues multiplied by their respective probabilities:\n<A> = λ₁P₁ + λ₂P₂\n<A> = (+ħ/2)*(9/14) + (-ħ/2)*(5/14)\n<A> = (ħ/28) * (9 - 5)\n<A> = 4ħ/28 = ħ/7\n\nThe calculated probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value is ħ/7. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
