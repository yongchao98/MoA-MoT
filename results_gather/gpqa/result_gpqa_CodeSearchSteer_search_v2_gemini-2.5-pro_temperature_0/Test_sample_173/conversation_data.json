    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the difference between the relativistic and classical kinetic energy of the more massive fragment.\n\n### 1. Determine the Rest-Masses of the Fragments\n\n*   **Initial rest-mass energy (M*c²):** 300 GeV\n*   **Relationship between fragment masses:** Let the masses of the two fragments be m₁ and m₂. We are given that one is twice as massive as the other, so let m₁ = 2 * m₂.\n*   **Sum of fragment masses:** The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass M.\n    *   m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M\n*   **Solving for the masses:**\n    *   Substitute m₁ = 2 * m₂ into the sum: 2*m₂ + m₂ = 0.99 * M\n    *   3*m₂ = 0.99 * M  =>  m₂ = 0.33 * M\n    *   m₁ = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M\n*   **Calculating the rest-mass energies of the fragments:**\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (m₁c²): 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (m₂c²): 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)\n\nThe energy released in the fission (Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the rest-mass energies of the fragments. This energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments (T₁ + T₂).\n\n*   **Q = M*c² - (m₁c² + m₂c²)**\n*   Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)\n*   Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV\n*   Q = 3000 MeV\n\n### 3. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta.\n\n*   **Conservation of momentum (p₁ = p₂):**\n    *   The classical formula for kinetic energy is T = p² / (2m).\n    *   Therefore, p = √(2mT).\n    *   √(2m₁T₁_classical) = √(2m₂T₂_classical)  =>  m₁T₁_classical = m₂T₂_classical.\n*   **Solving for T₁_classical:**\n    *   Since m₁ = 2m₂, we have 2m₂ * T₁_classical = m₂ * T₂_classical  =>  T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical.\n    *   The total kinetic energy is Q = T₁_classical + T₂_classical.\n    *   3 GeV = T₁_classical + 2 * T₁_classical = 3 * T₁_classical.\n    *   **T₁_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV.**\n\n### 4. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T₁\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, momentum and energy are related by the equation E² = (pc)² + (mc²)², where E is the total energy (E = T + mc²).\n\n*   **Relativistic momentum-energy relation:**\n    *   (pc)² = E² - (mc²)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2Tmc².\n*   **Conservation of momentum (p₁ = p₂ => (p₁c)² = (p₂c)²):**\n    *   T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c².\n*   **Solving for T₁:**\n    *   We know T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3 GeV - T₁. Substitute this into the equation.\n    *   T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)\n    *   T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)\n    *   396T₁ = 9 - 6T₁ + 594 - 198T₁\n    *   396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁\n    *   600T₁ = 603\n    *   **T₁ = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV.**\n\n### 5. Find the Difference\n\nThe difference is the relativistic value minus the classical value.\n\n*   **Difference = T₁ (relativistic) - T₁ (classical)**\n*   Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV.\n\n<<<D>>>"
