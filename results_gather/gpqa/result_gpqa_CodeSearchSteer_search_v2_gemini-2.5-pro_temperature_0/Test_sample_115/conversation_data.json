    "Here is a step-by-step identification of compound D:\n\n1.  **Identification of Compound A:** The proton NMR description of two signals, a triplet for 6H and a quartet for 4H, is a classic pattern for two equivalent ethyl groups. While the prompt simplifies the spectrum, this pattern, along with the subsequent reaction sequence, strongly points to **n-butane** (CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃). Due to the molecule's symmetry, there are two distinct proton environments: the -CH₃ groups and the -CH₂- groups, with an integration ratio of 6:4 (or 3:2). More complex splitting occurs in reality, but for an introductory problem, this simplified description is common.\n\n2.  **Formation of Compound B:** Compound A (n-butane) undergoes monobromination. The major product will be from the halogenation of a secondary carbon, resulting in **2-bromobutane**.\n\n3.  **Formation of Compound C:** Compound B (2-bromobutane) reacts with alcoholic potassium hydroxide (KOH). This is a dehydrohalogenation (elimination) reaction. According to Zaitsev's rule, the more substituted alkene is the major product. This reaction yields **but-2-ene** (CH₃-CH=CH-CH₃) as the major product, which exists as two geometrical isomers: *cis*-but-2-ene and *trans*-but-2-ene. This matches the description that compound C has two geometrical isomers.\n\n4.  **Diels-Alder Reaction to form Compound D:** The *cis*-isomer of C (*cis*-but-2-ene) is used as the dienophile in a Diels-Alder reaction. The diene is (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol.\n\n    *   **Dienophile:** *cis*-but-2-ene\n    *   **Diene:** (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol\n\n    This [4+2] cycloaddition reaction is stereospecific. The stereochemistry of the reactants determines the stereochemistry of the product.\n    *   The *cis* relationship of the two methyl groups in the dienophile is retained in the product, meaning they will be *cis* to each other on the newly formed cyclohexene ring.\n    *   The (E,E) stereochemistry of the diene means that its two outer substituents (the -OH group and the -CH₃ group) will be *trans* to each other in the product.\n    *   The reaction generally follows the **endo rule**, where the substituents of the dienophile are oriented on the same side of the ring as the substituents on the diene in the transition state. This results in the three methyl groups (one from the diene and two from the dienophile) all being *cis* to one another.\n\n5.  **Structure and Stereochemistry of Compound D:** The reaction produces **4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol**. Based on the stereochemical rules above, the final product has the following relative stereochemistry: the hydroxyl group at C1 is *trans* to the three methyl groups at C4, C5, and C6, which are all *cis* to each other.\n\n    Assigning the absolute configuration (R/S) based on this arrangement gives the name **(1S,4R,5S,6R)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol**.\n\nTherefore, compound D is (1S,4R,5S,6R)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol.\n\n<<<B>>>"
