    "The search results confirm the methodology.\n*   The system is a phosphate buffer composed of a weak acid (H2PO4-) and its conjugate base (HPO4^2-).\n*   The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is appropriate for calculating the pH of this buffer.\n*   The relevant pKa is pKa2, which is the dissociation of H2PO4-. The values for Ka2 and Ka3 given in the problem (6.2x10^-8 and 1.8x10^-12) are consistent with the values found in the search results (pKa2 ≈ 7.2, pKa3 ≈ 12.3).\n*   The final step is to use the calculated pH (or [H+]) and the Ka3 equilibrium to find the concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-).\n\nThe calculation steps are:\n1.  **Calculate moles of each component:**\n    *   Moles of KH2PO4 (source of H2PO4-) = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol.\n    *   Moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O (source of HPO4^2-) = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol.\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial molar concentrations:**\n    *   Volume = 200.00 cm3 = 0.200 L.\n    *   [H2PO4-] = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M.\n    *   [HPO4^2-] = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M.\n\n3.  **Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] using the Ka2 equilibrium:**\n    *   The relevant equilibrium is H2PO4- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-.\n    *   Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-].\n    *   [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-].\n    *   [H+] = (6.2 x 10^-8) * (0.03674 M) / (0.02809 M).\n    *   [H+] ≈ 8.11 x 10^-8 M.\n\n4.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion [PO4^3-] concentration using the Ka3 equilibrium:**\n    *   The relevant equilibrium is HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-.\n    *   Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-].\n    *   [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+].\n    *   Since Ka3 is very small, the equilibrium concentration of HPO4^2- is approximately its initial concentration.\n    *   [PO4^3-] = (1.8 x 10^-12) * (0.02809 M) / (8.11 x 10^-8 M).\n    *   [PO4^3-] ≈ 6.235 x 10^-7 M.\n\nThis result rounds to 6.24 x 10^-7 M, which corresponds to option D. The calculation is confirmed to be correct.\n\nFinal Answer is D.\nTo determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4³⁻), we must first calculate the concentrations of the buffer components and the pH of the solution.\n\n**1. Calculate the moles of each salt:**\n*   Moles of KH₂PO₄ = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n*   Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n\n**2. Calculate the initial concentrations of the buffer components:**\nThe volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³, which is equal to 0.200 L.\n*   Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻ = Moles / Volume = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M\n*   Concentration of HPO₄²⁻ = Moles / Volume = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M\n\n**3. Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺]:**\nThe solution is a buffer system composed of the weak acid H₂PO₄⁻ and its conjugate base HPO₄²⁻. The relevant equilibrium is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid, described by Ka₂.\nH₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\nKa₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for [H⁺]:\n[H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n[H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n[H⁺] ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n**4. Calculate the concentration of orthophosphate ions [PO₄³⁻]:**\nThe orthophosphate ion is formed from the third dissociation of phosphoric acid, which is described by Ka₃.\nHPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\nKa₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, [PO₄³⁻]. We use the previously calculated [H⁺] and the initial concentration of HPO₄²⁻, as its consumption in this step is negligible due to the very small value of Ka₃.\n[PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * [HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺]\n[PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M) / (8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n[PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.235 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThis value rounds to 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<D>>>"
