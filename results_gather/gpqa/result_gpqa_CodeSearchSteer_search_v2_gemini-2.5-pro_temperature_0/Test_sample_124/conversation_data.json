    "The problem describes a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator. The energy eigenvalues for such a system are given by the formula:\n\n$E_n = (n + 3/2) \\hbar \\omega$\n\nwhere $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$ is the principal quantum number, and $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are non-negative integers (0, 1, 2, ...).\n\nThe energy levels are:\n*   **Ground state (n=0):** This is the lowest energy level.\n    $E_0 = (0 + 3/2) \\hbar \\omega = (3/2) \\hbar \\omega$\n*   **First excited state (n=1):**\n    $E_1 = (1 + 3/2) \\hbar \\omega = (5/2) \\hbar \\omega$\n*   **Second excited state (n=2):**\n    $E_2 = (2 + 3/2) \\hbar \\omega = (7/2) \\hbar \\omega$\n*   **Third excited state (n=3):**\n    $E_3 = (3 + 3/2) \\hbar \\omega = (9/2) \\hbar \\omega$\n\nThe number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for a given energy level is its degeneracy. The degeneracy, $g_n$, for the n-th energy level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is given by the formula:\n\n$g_n = (n+1)(n+2)/2$\n\nFor the third excited state, n=3, the degeneracy is:\n\n$g_3 = (3+1)(3+2)/2 = (4)(5)/2 = 10$\n\nThis can also be found by listing the possible combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to 3:\n*   (3, 0, 0) and its 2 permutations: (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3) - (3 states)\n*   (2, 1, 0) and its 5 permutations: (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2) - (6 states)\n*   (1, 1, 1) - (1 state)\n\nThe total number of states is 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.\n\nTherefore, the energy of the third excited state is $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega$, and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for this energy.\n\n<<<B>>>"
