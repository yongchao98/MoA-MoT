    "To determine the relative radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness drop as the described starspots, we must first calculate the dimming caused by the spots and then equate it to the dimming caused by a planetary transit.\n\n### 1. Brightness Drop from Starspots\n\nThe change in a star's brightness due to spots is determined by the temperature difference between the stellar surface (photosphere) and the spots, as well as the fraction of the stellar disk covered by these spots. The flux (brightness) of a star is proportional to its effective temperature to the fourth power (Stefan-Boltzmann law).\n\nThe parameters given are:\n*   **Star's effective temperature (Teff):** 6000 K\n*   **Spot temperature (Tspot):** 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n*   **Spot filling factor (f_spot):** 20% or 0.20 (on the visible hemisphere)\n\nThe relative drop in flux (ΔF/F) when the spotted hemisphere is visible is calculated by comparing the flux of a completely unspotted disk to a spotted one. The formula for this amplitude is:\n\nΔF/F_spots = f_spot * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n*   ΔF/F_spots = 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴)\n*   ΔF/F_spots = 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)⁴)\n*   ΔF/F_spots = 0.20 * (1 - 0.48225)\n*   ΔF/F_spots = 0.20 * 0.51775\n*   **ΔF/F_spots ≈ 0.10355**\n\nThis means the star's brightness drops by approximately 10.36% when the spotted hemisphere rotates into view.\n\n### 2. Brightness Drop from an Exoplanet Transit\n\nThe dimming caused by an exoplanet transit is equivalent to the ratio of the planet's cross-sectional area to the star's cross-sectional area. This is often called the transit depth.\n\nThe formula for the transit depth is:\n\nΔF/F_planet = (Area_planet / Area_star) = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\nWhere:\n*   **R_pl** is the radius of the planet.\n*   **R_star** is the radius of the star.\n\n### 3. Equating the Signals\n\nThe problem requires finding the planet-to-star radius ratio (R_pl / R_star) that produces the same signal amplitude as the starspots.\n\nΔF/F_planet = ΔF/F_spots\n(R_pl / R_star)² = 0.10355\n\nTo find the relative radius, we take the square root of this value:\n\nR_pl / R_star = √0.10355\n**R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218**\n\nThis result is approximately 0.32.\n\n<<<B>>>"
