    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the pH at both points in the titration.\n\n### 1. Initial Dilution of Acetic Acid\n\nFirst, we calculate the new concentration of acetic acid after it has been diluted with water.\n*   **Initial moles of acetic acid (HA):**\n    Volume × Molarity = 0.02000 L × 0.05 mol/L = 0.001 mol\n*   **New total volume:**\n    20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³ = 0.04000 L\n*   **New concentration of acetic acid:**\n    Moles / New Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.04000 L = **0.025 M**\n\n### 2. pH at 25% Titration\n\nThis is the point where 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH, creating a buffer solution composed of acetic acid (HA) and its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻).\n\n*   **pKa calculation:** The pKa is calculated from the given Ka value.\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   **Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation:** For a buffer solution, the pH is found using this equation: pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]).\n*   **Ratio of [A⁻] to [HA]:** At 25% titration, 25% of the acid (HA) has been converted to its conjugate base (A⁻), leaving 75% of the acid unreacted.\n    *   Ratio = [A⁻]/[HA] = 25% / 75% = 1/3\n*   **pH Calculation:**\n    pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n    pH = 4.733 - 0.477\n    pH ≈ **4.26**\n\n### 3. pH at the Equivalence Point\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been completely neutralized by the NaOH to form sodium acetate. The solution now contains only the conjugate base (acetate, A⁻), which will hydrolyze water.\n\n*   **Volume of NaOH to reach equivalence:**\n    Moles of acid = Moles of base\n    0.001 mol = 0.1 mol/L × Volume of NaOH\n    Volume of NaOH = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n*   **Total volume at equivalence:**\n    40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.05000 L\n*   **Concentration of acetate ([A⁻]):**\n    [A⁻] = Initial moles of acid / Total volume = 0.001 mol / 0.05000 L = **0.02 M**\n*   **Hydrolysis of Acetate:** The acetate ion reacts with water, producing hydroxide ions (OH⁻).\n    A⁻ + H₂O ⇌ HA + OH⁻\n*   **Kb Calculation:** We need the base dissociation constant (Kb) for acetate, which can be found from Ka and Kw (the ion product of water, 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25 °C).\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n*   **[OH⁻] Calculation:** We can find the hydroxide concentration using the Kb expression.\n    Kb = [HA][OH⁻] / [A⁻] ≈ [OH⁻]² / [A⁻]\n    [OH⁻] = √(Kb × [A⁻]) = √(5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ × 0.02) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n*   **pOH and pH Calculation:**\n    pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.48 ≈ **8.52**\n\nBased on the calculations, the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52.\n\n<<<B>>>"
