    "To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we must first identify the color of the light it emits. The color an object appears to be is the color it reflects or emits, while it absorbs the complementary color.\n\n1.  **Calculate the wavelength of the emitted light:** The energy of the emitted light is given as 2.3393 eV. The relationship between energy (E) in electron-volts (eV) and wavelength (λ) in nanometers (nm) can be approximated by the formula:\n    λ ≈ 1240 / E\n    λ ≈ 1240 / 2.3393 eV ≈ 530.07 nm\n\n2.  **Determine the color of the emitted light:** A wavelength of approximately 530 nm falls within the green portion of the visible light spectrum. Therefore, the textile dye emits green light.\n\n3.  **Find the absorbed (complementary) color:** The color of light a substance absorbs is complementary to the color it emits or transmits. On a traditional color wheel, the complementary color to green is red. When a compound absorbs red light from the visible spectrum, the remaining transmitted or reflected light appears green to our eyes.\n\nTherefore, the organic compound absorbs red light.\n\n<<<C>>>"
