    "An oscillating charge distribution, particularly one with a defined symmetry axis like a spheroid, can be modeled as an oscillating electric dipole, assuming its size is much smaller than the radiated wavelength. This is the most fundamental mode of radiation.\n\nThe power radiated per unit solid angle (dP/dΩ) for an oscillating electric dipole is described by the Larmor formula. The angular distribution of this power is not uniform; it depends on the angle θ relative to the axis of oscillation (the z-axis in this case).\n\nThe formula for the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle is:\ndP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)\n\nFrom this relationship, we can determine the following:\n*   **Maximum Power (A):** The radiated power is at its maximum when sin²(θ) is at its maximum. The maximum value of sin(θ) is 1, which occurs at θ = 90° (in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis). Therefore, the maximum radiated power, A, is proportional to sin²(90°) = 1.\n*   **Power at θ = 30°:** To find the fraction of the maximum power radiated at an angle of 30°, we evaluate sin²(30°). Since sin(30°) = 1/2, sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4.\n*   **Fraction of Maximum Power:** The fraction of A at 30° is the ratio of the power at 30° to the power at 90°, which is (proportionality constant * 1/4) / (proportionality constant * 1) = 1/4.\n\nNext, we consider the dependence of the radiated power on the wavelength (λ). The power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency (ω⁴). The relationship between angular frequency and wavelength is ω = 2πc/λ, where c is the speed of light.\n\nTherefore, the power dependence on wavelength is:\nP ∝ ω⁴ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴\n\nCombining these two results, the fraction of the maximum power A radiated at an angle θ = 30° is 1/4, and a possible form of the function f, which describes the radiated power, includes a λ⁻⁴ dependence.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
