    "The reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism involving a benzyne intermediate. The strong base, amide anion (NH2-), abstracts a proton from the benzene ring ortho to the bromine atom.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the possible reaction pathways:\n\n1.  **Formation of Benzyne Intermediates:**\n    The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. There are two acidic hydrogens ortho to the bromine: a deuterium (D) at the C2 position and a hydrogen (H) at the C6 position. The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond, meaning the hydrogen at C6 is more readily abstracted by the base. This difference in bond strength is known as the kinetic isotope effect. However, both abstractions are possible, leading to two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n    *   **Pathway A (Major):** The amide anion abstracts the proton (H) from the C6 position. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 results in the formation of **3-deuterobenzyne**. In this intermediate, the triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium remains at the C2 position.\n    *   **Pathway B (Minor):** The amide anion abstracts the deuterium (D) from the C2 position. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 results in the formation of **benzyne** (non-deuterated). In this intermediate, the triple bond is between C1 and C2, and the deuterium has been removed.\n\n2.  **Nucleophilic Addition to Benzyne Intermediates:**\n    The amide anion then acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\n    *   **Products from Pathway A (3-deuterobenzyne):**\n        *   Attack at C1: The amino group (-NH2) adds to C1. Protonation of the resulting anion at C6 yields **2-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   Attack at C6: The amino group adds to C6. Protonation of the resulting anion at C1 yields **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n    *   **Product from Pathway B (benzyne):**\n        *   Attack at either C1 or C2 of the non-deuterated benzyne intermediate, followed by protonation, yields a single product: **aniline**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nCombining the products from both possible pathways, we find there are three distinct possible organic products:\n*   2-deuterioaniline\n*   3-deuterioaniline\n*   Aniline\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>"
