    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of product 3 and the number of its carbon atoms.\n\n**Step 1: trans-cinnamaldehyde + methylmagnesium bromide → product 1**\n\n*   **Reactants**: *trans*-cinnamaldehyde has a structure of C₆H₅-CH=CH-CHO. It contains a phenyl group, a carbon-carbon double bond, and an aldehyde functional group. It has a total of 9 carbon atoms. Methylmagnesium bromide (CH₃MgBr) is a Grignard reagent.\n*   **Reaction**: The Grignard reagent will perform a 1,2-addition to the carbonyl group of the aldehyde. The methyl group (CH₃) attacks the carbonyl carbon, and after an aqueous workup, the carbonyl oxygen becomes a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   **Product 1**: The resulting product is a secondary alcohol, (E)-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-ol, with the structure C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(OH)CH₃.\n*   **Carbon Count**: The original 9 carbons from cinnamaldehyde plus 1 carbon from the methylmagnesium bromide results in a total of **10 carbon atoms** in product 1.\n\n**Step 2: product 1 + pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) → product 2**\n\n*   **Reactants**: Product 1 is a secondary alcohol (C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(OH)CH₃). Pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) is a mild oxidizing agent.\n*   **Reaction**: PCC oxidizes secondary alcohols to ketones. It is a selective reagent that will not affect the carbon-carbon double bond in the molecule.\n*   **Product 2**: The secondary alcohol group is oxidized to a ketone, forming (E)-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-one. The structure is C₆H₅-CH=CH-C(=O)CH₃.\n*   **Carbon Count**: No carbon atoms are added or removed during this oxidation step, so product 2 also has **10 carbon atoms**.\n\n**Step 3: product 2 + (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane → product 3**\n\n*   **Reactants**: Product 2 is an α,β-unsaturated ketone (C₆H₅-CH=CH-C(=O)CH₃). The reagent, (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane, is the IUPAC name for dimethyloxosulfonium methylide, [(CH₃)₂S(O)CH₂], also known as the Corey-Chaykovsky reagent.\n*   **Reaction**: When the Corey-Chaykovsky reagent reacts with α,β-unsaturated ketones (enones), it performs a conjugate addition (Michael addition) followed by ring closure to form a cyclopropane ring across the former carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Product 3**: The methylene group (CH₂) from the ylide adds across the C=C double bond of product 2, creating a cyclopropane ring. The final structure is (2-phenylcyclopropyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Carbon Count**: Product 2 had 10 carbon atoms. The Corey-Chaykovsky reagent adds one carbon atom (from the CH₂ group) to the molecule. Therefore, the total number of carbon atoms in product 3 is 10 + 1 = **11**.\n\nThe final count of carbon atoms in product 3 is 11.\n\n<<<C>>>"
