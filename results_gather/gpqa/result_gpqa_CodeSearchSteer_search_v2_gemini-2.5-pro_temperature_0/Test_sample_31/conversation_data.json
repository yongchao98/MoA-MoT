    "To determine the energy of the Lithium-6 nucleus, we must first calculate its rest energy and then apply the principles of special relativity to find its total energy when moving at 0.96c.\n\n### 1. Identification of the Nucleus\nThe nucleus X is defined as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. The atomic number of Lithium is 3, meaning it has 3 protons. With 3 neutrons, the mass number (A) is the sum of protons and neutrons, which is 3 + 3 = 6. Therefore, the nucleus is Lithium-6 (⁶Li).\n\n### 2. Calculation of the Lorentz Factor (γ)\nThe Lorentz factor is a function of the velocity (v) relative to the speed of light (c).\nGiven the speed v = 0.96c, the Lorentz factor is calculated as:\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\nγ = 1 / √(1 - (0.96c)²/c²)\nγ = 1 / √(1 - 0.9216)\nγ = 1 / √0.0784\nγ = 1 / 0.28\nγ ≈ 3.5714\n\n### 3. Calculation of the Rest Energy (E₀)\nThe rest energy of the nucleus can be approximated by multiplying its mass number (A) by the mass of a nucleon. For this calculation, we will use the mass of a neutron as an approximation, which is a common convention in such problems.\n*   Mass number (A) of ⁶Li = 6\n*   Rest energy of a neutron ≈ 939.57 MeV.\n\nThe approximate rest energy of the Lithium-6 nucleus is:\nE₀ ≈ 6 * 939.57 MeV\nE₀ ≈ 5637.42 MeV\nE₀ ≈ 5.6374 GeV\n\n### 4. Calculation of the Total Relativistic Energy (E)\nThe total energy (E) of the nucleus moving at a relativistic speed is the product of its Lorentz factor and its rest energy.\nE = γ * E₀\nE ≈ 3.5714 * 5.6374 GeV\nE ≈ 20.1336 GeV\n\nThis calculated value is extremely close to option A. The minor difference is due to the rounding of physical constants.\n\nTherefore, the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c is approximately 20.132 GeV.\n\n<<<A>>>"
