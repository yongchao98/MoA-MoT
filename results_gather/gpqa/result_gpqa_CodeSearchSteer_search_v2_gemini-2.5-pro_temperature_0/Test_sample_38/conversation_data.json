    "To find the numerical value of \"a\", we must use the normalization condition for the wave function. The Born rule in quantum mechanics states that the square of the modulus of the wave function, |ψ(x)|², represents the probability density of finding the particle at a position x. Since the particle must be somewhere, the integral of this probability density over all possible positions must be equal to 1.\n\nThe given wave function is:\nψ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i\n\nThe problem states that the particles are only found in the region between x=1 and x=3. Therefore, the integration for normalization will be over this interval.\n\nFirst, we calculate the probability density function, |ψ(x)|²:\n|ψ(x)|² = ψ*(x) * ψ(x)\nwhere ψ*(x) is the complex conjugate of ψ(x).\n\nThe complex conjugate is found by changing the sign of the imaginary part:\nψ*(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) + 0.5*i\n\nNow, we multiply ψ(x) by ψ*(x):\n|ψ(x)|² = [ ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) + 0.5*i ] * [ ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i ]\nThis multiplication is of the form (A + B)(A - B) = A² - B², which simplifies the calculation:\n|ψ(x)|² = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) )² - (0.5*i)²\n|ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) - (0.25 * i²)\nSince i² = -1:\n|ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) - (-0.25)\n|ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\nNext, we apply the normalization condition by integrating |ψ(x)|² from x=1 to x=3 and setting the result to 1:\n∫¹³ (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1\n\nWe solve the integral:\n∫ (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = a² ∫ 1/(1+x) dx + 0.25 ∫ dx\n= a² * ln(1 + x) + 0.25 * x\n\nNow, we evaluate the definite integral from 1 to 3:\n[ a² * ln(1 + x) + 0.25 * x ]¹³ = (a² * ln(1 + 3) + 0.25 * 3) - (a² * ln(1 + 1) + 0.25 * 1)\n= (a² * ln(4) + 0.75) - (a² * ln(2) + 0.25)\n= a² * (ln(4) - ln(2)) + 0.5\nUsing the logarithm property ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B):\n= a² * ln(4/2) + 0.5\n= a² * ln(2) + 0.5\n\nFinally, we set this expression equal to 1 and solve for \"a\":\na² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\na² * ln(2) = 0.5\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n\nUsing the value ln(2) ≈ 0.6931:\na² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931\na² ≈ 0.7214\na ≈ sqrt(0.7214)\na ≈ 0.8493\n\nThis value is closest to the option A) 0.85.\n\n<<<A>>>"
