    "The search results confirm the underlying physics principles I used.\n\n1.  **Kepler's Third Law**: The total mass of a binary system is related to the orbital period and the separation between the stars (M1 + M2 = a³/P² in appropriate units).\n2.  **Spectroscopic Binaries**: For these systems, we measure radial velocities via the Doppler shift. The orbital speeds can be determined from the radial velocity curve.\n3.  **Eclipsing Binaries**: The presence of eclipses implies that the system is viewed nearly edge-on (inclination angle i ≈ 90°). This is a crucial piece of information because it means the measured maximum radial velocities are essentially the true orbital speeds.\n4.  **Deriving Mass from Velocity and Period**: The separation 'a' can be expressed in terms of the velocities and the period (a = a1 + a2, and each radius r is related to v and P). This allows for the calculation of the total mass.\n\nThe formula I derived, M ∝ P * (v_total)³, correctly combines these principles.\n\nLet's re-state the problem and my calculation to be sure.\n\n**Objective**: Find the ratio of the total mass of system 1 to the total mass of system 2 (M_total_1 / M_total_2).\n\n**Given Information**:\n*   **System 1**:\n    *   Period (P1) = 2 years\n    *   Velocity amplitudes (v1a, v1b) = 10 km/s, 5 km/s\n    *   Total velocity (v_total_1) = 10 + 5 = 15 km/s\n*   **System 2**:\n    *   Period (P2) = 1 year\n    *   Velocity amplitudes (v2a, v2b) = 15 km/s, 10 km/s\n    *   Total velocity (v_total_2) = 15 + 10 = 25 km/s\n\n**Derived Relationship**:\nThe total mass (M) of an eclipsing spectroscopic binary is proportional to the orbital period (P) and the cube of the sum of the orbital velocities (v_total).\nM ∝ P * (v_total)³\n\n**Calculation of the Ratio**:\nM1 / M2 = (P1 * (v_total_1)³) / (P2 * (v_total_2)³)\nM1 / M2 = (P1 / P2) * (v_total_1 / v_total_2)³\nM1 / M2 = (2 years / 1 year) * (15 km/s / 25 km/s)³\nM1 / M2 = 2 * (3/5)³\nM1 / M2 = 2 * (27 / 125)\nM1 / M2 = 54 / 125\nM1 / M2 = 0.432\n\nThe result 0.432 is closest to 0.4. The logic and calculations seem sound and are supported by the fundamental principles of binary star astronomy found in the search results.\n\nFinal check of the question and options.\nQuestion: By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? (i.e., M1/M2)\nOptions: A) ~ 0.4, B) ~ 0.7, C) ~ 0.6, D) ~ 1.2\nMy answer is ~0.432, which corresponds to option A.\n\nThe steps are clear and the physics is correct for the idealized case presented in the problem. I am ready to provide the final answer.To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we can use the principles of orbital mechanics for binary stars. Since both systems are eclipsing, we can assume their orbital planes are viewed edge-on (inclination angle i ≈ 90°). This means the observed maximum radial velocities are the actual orbital speeds of the stars.\n\nThe total mass of a binary system (M = m₁ + m₂) can be derived from Kepler's Third Law. The law relates the total mass to the orbital period (P) and the semi-major axis of the relative orbit (a).\n\nKepler's Third Law is given by:\nM = (4π²a³) / (GP²)\n\nFor a circular orbit, the semi-major axis of each star's orbit (a₁ and a₂) can be related to its orbital velocity (v₁ and v₂) and the period (P):\na₁ = (v₁P) / 2π\na₂ = (v₂P) / 2π\n\nThe semi-major axis of the relative orbit is the sum of the individual semi-major axes:\na = a₁ + a₂ = ((v₁ + v₂)P) / 2π\n\nSubstituting this expression for 'a' into Kepler's Third Law gives a formula for the total mass in terms of observable quantities:\nM = (1 / (2πG)) * P * (v₁ + v₂)³\n\nTo find the ratio of the mass of system_1 (M₁) to the mass of system_2 (M₂), we can set up the following equation:\nM₁ / M₂ = [ (P₁ * (v₁ₐ + v₁ₑ)³) / (2πG) ] / [ (P₂ * (v₂ₐ + v₂ₑ)³) / (2πG) ]\n\nThe constant terms (2πG) cancel out, simplifying the ratio to:\nM₁ / M₂ = (P₁ / P₂) * [ (v₁ₐ + v₁ₑ) / (v₂ₐ + v₂ₑ) ]³\n\nNow, we can substitute the given values for each system:\n\n**For System 1:**\n*   Period (P₁) = 2 years\n*   Sum of velocity amplitudes (v₁ₐ + v₁ₑ) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n**For System 2:**\n*   Period (P₂) = 1 year\n*   Sum of velocity amplitudes (v₂ₐ + v₂ₑ) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nPlugging these values into the ratio equation:\nM₁ / M₂ = (2 / 1) * (15 / 25)³\nM₁ / M₂ = 2 * (3 / 5)³\nM₁ / M₂ = 2 * (27 / 125)\nM₁ / M₂ = 54 / 125\nM₁ / M₂ = 0.432\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately 0.432. Comparing this to the given options, the closest value is 0.4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
