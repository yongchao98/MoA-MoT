    "The search results confirm the formulas and constants used in the initial reasoning.\n\n1.  **Boltzmann Equation**: The ratio of the number of atoms (N) in two energy levels (a and b) is given by `Nb/Na = (gb/ga) * exp(-(Eb-Ea)/(k*T))`. This confirms the formula used. The problem assumes Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which is a necessary condition for this equation to be valid in a stellar atmosphere.\n\n2.  **Energy-Wavelength Relation**: The energy difference (ΔE) corresponding to a photon's wavelength (λ) is `ΔE = h*c/λ`.\n\n3.  **Constants**:\n    *   Planck's constant (h): ~4.1357 × 10⁻¹⁵ eV·s.\n    *   Boltzmann's constant (k): ~8.6173 × 10⁻⁵ eV/K.\n    *   The product `h*c` is often approximated as 1240 eV·nm or 1.24 eV·µm.\n\nThe calculation steps were:\n1.  Calculate the energy difference `ΔE` from the wavelength `λ = 1448 Å = 144.8 nm`.\n2.  Calculate the ratio of the ratios `Factor = (N2/N1)_nospots / (N2/N1)_spots`.\n3.  Use the given temperatures: `T_nospots = 6000 K` and `T_spots = 5500 K`.\n\nLet's re-do the calculation with the confirmed constants to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate ΔE**\nUsing the convenient formula `E (eV) = 1240 / λ (nm)`:\n*   `λ = 144.8 nm`\n*   `ΔE = 1240 / 144.8 ≈ 8.5635 eV`\n\n**Step 2: Set up the factor equation**\nThe factor is the ratio of the Boltzmann populations at the two different temperatures:\n`Factor = [exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots))] / [exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots))]`\n`Factor = exp[ (-ΔE/k) * (1/T_nospots - 1/T_spots) ]`\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the exponent**\n*   `ΔE` ≈ 8.5635 eV\n*   `k` ≈ 8.6173 × 10⁻⁵ eV/K\n*   `T_nospots` = 6000 K\n*   `T_spots` = 5500 K\n\nFirst, calculate `ΔE/k`:\n`ΔE/k ≈ 8.5635 / (8.6173 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 99375 K`\n\nNext, calculate the temperature term:\n`1/T_nospots - 1/T_spots = 1/6000 - 1/5500 = (5500 - 6000) / (6000 * 5500) = -500 / 33,000,000 = -1 / 66,000 K⁻¹`\n\nNow, calculate the full exponent:\n`Exponent = (-99375 K) * (-1 / 66,000 K⁻¹) = 99375 / 66000 ≈ 1.5057`\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final factor**\n`Factor = exp(1.5057) ≈ 4.507`\n\nThis result is extremely close to 4.5. The minor variations in the final decimal places are due to rounding of the physical constants. The answer is robustly ~4.5.\n\nThe extra information (stellar radius, mass, spot coverage percentage) is contextual and not needed for the calculation, as the resulting effective temperatures are provided directly. The core of the problem is a direct application of the Boltzmann equation.\n\nFinal check of the question and options:\n- Question: \"What is the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots?\" This is `Ratio_nospots / Ratio_spots`.\n- My calculation gives a factor of ~4.5.\n- Option A) ~1.1\n- Option B) ~4.5\n- Option C) ~2.9\n- Option D) ~7.8\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\nFinal answer seems to be B. I am confident in the result.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the ratio of the populations of two energy levels at two different temperatures using the Boltzmann equation. The problem states that the stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which allows the use of this equation.\n\nThe Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms (N) in two different energy states (level 1 and level 2):\nN₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n\nWhere:\n*   N₂ and N₁ are the number of atoms in the higher (2) and lower (1) energy levels.\n*   g₂ and g₁ are the statistical weights of the levels.\n*   ΔE is the energy difference between the two levels (E₂ - E₁).\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nWe are asked to find the factor by which this ratio changes, which is the ratio without spots divided by the ratio with spots:\nFactor = (N₂/N₁)nospots / (N₂/N₁)spots\n\nFactor = [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)) ] / [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots)) ]\n\nThe statistical weights (g₂/g₁) cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\nFactor = exp[ -ΔE/k * (1/T_nospots - 1/T_spots) ]\n\nNow, we must determine the values for the variables:\n1.  **Temperatures**:\n    *   Temperature without spots (T_nospots) = 6000 K.\n    *   Temperature with spots (T_spots) = 5500 K.\n\n2.  **Energy Difference (ΔE)**: This can be calculated from the given wavelength (λ) of the transition using the Planck-Einstein relation, E = hc/λ.\n    *   λ = 1448 Å = 144.8 nm.\n    *   A convenient form of this relation is E(eV) ≈ 1240 / λ(nm).\n    *   ΔE ≈ 1240 eV·nm / 144.8 nm ≈ 8.5635 eV.\n\n3.  **Boltzmann Constant (k)**: The value in electron volts per Kelvin is k ≈ 8.6173 × 10⁻⁵ eV/K.\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the factor equation. First, let's calculate the value of the term ΔE/k:\nΔE/k ≈ 8.5635 eV / (8.6173 × 10⁻⁵ eV/K) ≈ 99375 K.\n\nNext, we plug this into the exponent of our factor equation:\nExponent = - (ΔE/k) * (1/T_nospots - 1/T_spots)\nExponent ≈ -99375 K * (1/6000 K - 1/5500 K)\nExponent ≈ -99375 * ( (5500 - 6000) / (6000 * 5500) )\nExponent ≈ -99375 * (-500 / 33,000,000)\nExponent ≈ -99375 * (-1 / 66,000)\nExponent ≈ 1.5057\n\nFinally, we calculate the factor:\nFactor = exp(1.5057) ≈ 4.507\n\nThis value is approximately 4.5.\n\n<<<B>>>"
