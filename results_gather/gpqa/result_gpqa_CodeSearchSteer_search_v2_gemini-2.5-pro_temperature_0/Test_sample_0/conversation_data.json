    "To clearly distinguish between two energy levels, their energy difference must be greater than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties, a concept rooted in the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The uncertainty in the energy (ΔE) of a quantum state is inversely related to its lifetime (Δt or τ).\n\nThe time-energy uncertainty principle can be expressed as:\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\nFor practical purposes, the energy width or uncertainty (ΔE) of a state with lifetime τ can be approximated as:\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\nFirst, we calculate the energy uncertainty for each state:\n\n**For the first state (E1):**\n*   Lifetime (τ₁) = 10⁻⁹ s\n*   Energy uncertainty (ΔE₁) ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**For the second state (E2):**\n*   Lifetime (τ₂) = 10⁻⁸ s\n*   Energy uncertainty (ΔE₂) ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nTo be clearly resolved, the energy difference between the two levels (|E₁ - E₂|) must be significantly larger than the sum of their energy uncertainties (ΔE₁ + ΔE₂). The state with the shorter lifetime has a broader energy level, which is the primary factor limiting resolution.\n\nThe total energy uncertainty is approximately the uncertainty of the broader level, which is ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV. Therefore, the energy difference must be substantially greater than this value.\n\nLet's examine the given options:\nA) 10⁻⁸ eV (Smaller than the uncertainty of either state)\nB) 10⁻⁴ eV (Significantly larger than the calculated total uncertainty)\nC) 10⁻¹¹ eV (Much smaller than the uncertainty of either state)\nD) 10⁻⁹ eV (Smaller than the uncertainty of the first state)\n\nOnly option B provides an energy difference that is several orders of magnitude larger than the inherent energy width of the states, ensuring they can be clearly distinguished.\n\n<<<B>>>"
