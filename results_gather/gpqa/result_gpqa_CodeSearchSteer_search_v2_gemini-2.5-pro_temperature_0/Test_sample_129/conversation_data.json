    "To estimate the lower limit on the redshift of neutral hydrogen clouds so they can be detected by ground-based optical telescopes, we need to consider the wavelength at which Earth's atmosphere becomes transparent to light.\n\nThe Lyman-alpha (Lyα) transition of neutral hydrogen has a rest wavelength of approximately 1216 Angstroms (Å). This wavelength falls in the ultraviolet (UV) part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Earth's atmosphere is largely opaque to UV radiation, effectively blocking light with wavelengths shorter than about 3200-3500 Å from reaching ground-based telescopes. For a Lyα absorption line to be detectable from the ground, it must be redshifted to a wavelength longer than this atmospheric cutoff.\n\nThe relationship between rest wavelength (λ_rest), observed wavelength (λ_obs), and redshift (z) is given by the formula:\nλ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + z)\n\nTo find the minimum redshift, we set λ_obs to the atmospheric cutoff wavelength. Using a conservative cutoff of ~3500 Å:\n\nz = (λ_obs / λ_rest) - 1\nz = (3500 Å / 1216 Å) - 1\nz ≈ 2.88 - 1\nz ≈ 1.88\n\nThis calculation shows that the redshift must be approximately 1.9 or greater for the Lyα line to be shifted into the optical window accessible from the ground. Studies of the Lyα forest, which is a series of such absorption lines, confirm that it can be observed by ground-based telescopes for objects with redshifts greater than 2. For lower redshifts, observations must be carried out by space-based telescopes like the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\nTherefore, the estimated lower limit on the redshift for these objects to be detected with optical ground-based telescopes is approximately 1.9.\n\n<<<D>>>"
