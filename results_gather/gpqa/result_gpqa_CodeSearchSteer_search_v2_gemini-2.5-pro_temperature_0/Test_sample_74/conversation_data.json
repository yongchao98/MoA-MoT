  "question": "You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected.

    "To determine the reason for the failed protein overexpression, the provided DNA sequence must be analyzed in the context of protein translation.\n\nThe sequence begins with `5' ATG...`, which correctly corresponds to the start codon for Methionine, initiating translation. The next segment, `TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC`, translates to the amino acid sequence YPYDVPDYA. This is the correct and standard sequence for the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) antigenic tag. Therefore, option A is incorrect as there is no missense mutation in the tag.\n\nFollowing the HA tag sequence is the codon `AAA`, which codes for the amino acid Lysine. The very next codon in the sequence is `TGA`. In the standard genetic code, TGA is one of the three stop codons (along with TAA and TAG) that signal the termination of translation. When the ribosome encounters this `TGA` codon, it will halt protein synthesis and release the nascent polypeptide chain.\n\nThis means that translation stops immediately after the HA tag and a single Lysine residue. The intended coding sequence for the GADD45G protein, which follows the `TGA` codon, is never translated. This premature termination of translation is the direct cause of the failure to express the full-length recombinant protein.\n\n*   **A) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation:** This is incorrect. The DNA sequence `TACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCC` correctly codes for the HA tag (YPYDVPDYA).\n*   **B) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain:** While linkers can be important for protein folding, the presence of a premature stop codon is a more direct and definitive reason for the complete lack of the full-length protein.\n*   **C) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse:** This statement is flawed. tRNAs do not exist for any stop codon in any organism, including mice; instead, release factors recognize these codons. Furthermore, the stop codon in the sequence is TGA, not TAA.\n*   **D) The ribosome terminated the translation early:** This is correct. The presence of the `TGA` stop codon immediately after the HA tag sequence causes translation to stop before the GADD45G protein can be synthesized.\n\n<<<D>>>"
