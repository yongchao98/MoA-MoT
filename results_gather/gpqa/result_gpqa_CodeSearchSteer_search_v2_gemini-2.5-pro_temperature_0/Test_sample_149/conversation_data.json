    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Starting Compound\n\nFirst, we must determine the structure of the initial reactant from its molecular formula (C8H9NO) and 1H-NMR data.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula (C8H9NO):** The degree of unsaturation is calculated as (2C + 2 + N - H - X)/2 = (2*8 + 2 + 1 - 9)/2 = 10/2 = 5. A value of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (e.g., a carbonyl group).\n*   **1H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift and splitting pattern (triplet) are characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the methylene protons (-CH2-) next to the aldehyde group. The doublet splitting confirms they are coupled to the single aldehyde proton. This confirms a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is typical for a primary amine (-NH2) group attached to an aromatic ring.\n\n*   **Structure Determination:** Assembling these fragments, the compound is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. The para-substituted ring contains an amino group (-NH2) and an acetaldehyde group (-CH2CHO).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Reaction Sequence\n\n1.  **NaNO2 + HCl (Diazotization):** This set of reagents converts a primary aromatic amine into a diazonium salt. 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde is converted to the corresponding diazonium salt.\n\n2.  **H2O (Hydrolysis):** Adding water to the diazonium salt replaces the diazonium group (-N2+) with a hydroxyl group (-OH). This reaction forms **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n3.  **aq. KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation):** 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde has acidic α-protons (on the -CH2- group). In the presence of a strong base (KOH) and heat, it will undergo a self-condensation reaction.\n    *   First, an aldol addition occurs, where the enolate of one molecule attacks the carbonyl group of a second molecule. This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde.\n    *   With the application of heat, this intermediate readily undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to form a more stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Final Product Structure\n\nThe self-condensation of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde proceeds as follows:\n\n*   **Addition Product (Intermediate):** 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal (This corresponds to option D).\n*   **Condensation Product (Final):** Upon heating, this intermediate eliminates water to form a double bond between the alpha and beta carbons. The final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This structure is a but-2-enal with 4-hydroxyphenyl groups at positions 2 and 4.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n\n*   A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal - Incorrect hydroxyl groups and double bond position.\n*   B) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal - Incorrect, as it's a product of a single molecule, not a condensation of two.\n*   C) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal - **Correct.** This matches our derived final product.\n*   D) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal - This is the intermediate aldol addition product, not the final product under heating conditions.\n\n<<<C>>>"
