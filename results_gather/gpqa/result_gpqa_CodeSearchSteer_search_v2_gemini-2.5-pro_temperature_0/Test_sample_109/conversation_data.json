    "To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs, we must consider two factors: the star's visibility from each observatory's location and its apparent brightness.\n\n### 1. Observatory Location and Visibility\n\nA star can only be observed if it rises above the horizon at the observatory's location. This is determined by the star's declination (DEC) and the observatory's latitude.\n\n*   **Paranal Observatory (VLT/ESPRESSO):** Located in the Southern Hemisphere in Chile (Latitude ~24.6° S). It can observe the southern sky and parts of the northern sky, generally up to a declination of about +45°.\n*   **W. M. Keck Observatory (HIRES):** Located in the Northern Hemisphere in Hawaii, USA (Latitude ~19.8° N). It can observe the northern sky and parts of the southern sky, generally down to a declination of about -55°.\n\nFor a star to be visible from **both** observatories, its declination must be within the range of approximately **-55° to +45°**.\n\nLet's check the declination of each star:\n*   **Star1:** DEC = -75°. This is too far south for the Keck Observatory.\n*   **Star2:** DEC = +55°. This is too far north for the Paranal Observatory.\n*   **Star3:** DEC = +48°. This is too far north for the Paranal Observatory.\n*   **Star4:** DEC = -48°. This falls within the observable range for both observatories (-55° < -48° < +45°).\n*   **Star5:** DEC = +60°. This is too far north for the Paranal Observatory.\n\nBased on location alone, **only Star 4** is visible from both observatories.\n\n### 2. Apparent Magnitude Calculation\n\nNext, we must ensure the star is bright enough for both instruments. A star must be brighter than the limiting magnitude of the less sensitive instrument.\n*   **ESPRESSO limit:** Apparent V magnitude < 17\n*   **HIRES limit:** Apparent V magnitude < 16\n*   **Combined limit:** A star must have an apparent V magnitude **brighter than 16.0** to be seen by both.\n\nThe apparent magnitude (m) is calculated from the absolute magnitude (M), distance (d), and extinction (A_V) using the distance modulus formula: m = M + 5*log₁₀(d/10) + A_V. Extinction (A_V) is calculated as 3.1 * E(B-V).\n\nLet's calculate the apparent V magnitude for the star visible from both locations:\n\n*   **Star 4:**\n    *   Absolute V magnitude (M_V) = 15.5 mag\n    *   Distance (d) = 10 pc\n    *   Color Excess E(B-V) = 0.4 mag\n    *   Extinction (A_V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag\n    *   Apparent V magnitude (m_V) = 15.5 + 5*log₁₀(10/10) + 1.24\n    *   m_V = 15.5 + 0 + 1.24 = **16.74 mag**\n\nThe apparent magnitude of Star 4 is 16.74. This is fainter than the HIRES limit of 16.0. Therefore, Star 4 cannot be observed by the HIRES spectrograph.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAlthough the problem asks to disregard pointing limits and telescope altitudes for simplicity, the fundamental constraint of hemispheric visibility cannot be ignored for two observatories on opposite sides of the equator. Based on this, only Star 4 is in a position to be seen by both. However, its calculated apparent magnitude is too faint for HIRES.\n\nThis leads to the conclusion that **none of the listed stars** can be detected by both instruments. Since \"None of the above\" is not an option, there might be an intended interpretation where the declination limits are to be completely ignored, contrary to standard observational practice.\n\nIf we strictly ignore the declination and only consider the magnitude limits, the results would be:\n*   **Star 1:** m_V = 15.5. (Observable)\n*   **Star 2:** m_V = 16.5. (Not observable by HIRES)\n*   **Star 3:** m_V = 15.5. (Observable)\n*   **Star 4:** m_V = 16.74. (Not observable by HIRES)\n*   **Star 5:** m_V = 14.995. (Observable)\n\nUnder this alternative interpretation, Stars 1, 3, and 5 would be observable. The option that fits this result is **D) Star3 and Star5**. Given the multiple-choice format, this is the most probable intended answer, assuming the prompt's simplification was meant to disregard celestial coordinates entirely.\n\n<<<D>>>"
