    "The reasoning and calculations performed before the search are confirmed by the search results.\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula**: The search results confirm that the equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is related to the star's properties and the planet's orbital distance (semi-major axis 'a') and albedo 'A'. Specifically, result states that the planet's temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance from the star. The formula is T_eq ∝ (1/a)^(1/2). This confirms the relationship used in the initial reasoning: (T_i / T_j) = sqrt(a_j / a_i). The problem states the albedo is the same for all planets, so it cancels out in the ratio.\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law**: The search results also confirm Kepler's Third Law, which states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a). The ratio form is given as (P_i / P_j)^2 = (a_i / a_j)^3, which leads to P_i / P_j = (a_i / a_j)^(3/2). This matches the formula used in the calculation.\n\n3.  **Extraneous Information**: The information about planet masses and the TTV discovery method is confirmed to be irrelevant for this specific calculation, as the standard form of Kepler's law is used when planet masses are negligible compared to the star's mass.\n\nThe initial step-by-step calculation is therefore correct.\n\n**Step 1: Relate equilibrium temperature and semi-major axis.**\nFrom the relationship T_eq ∝ 1/√a, we get a_j/a_i = (T_i/T_j)².\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes (a3/a1).**\n*   Given T1/T2 ≈ 1.4, the ratio of their semi-major axes is a2/a1 = (1.4)² = 1.96.\n*   Given T2/T3 ≈ 2.3, the ratio of their semi-major axes is a3/a2 = (2.3)² = 5.29.\n*   The total ratio is a3/a1 = (a3/a2) * (a2/a1) = 5.29 * 1.96 = 10.3684.\n\n**Step 3: Use Kepler's Third Law to find the orbital period ratio (P3/P1).**\nFrom Kepler's Third Law, P^2 ∝ a^3, so P3/P1 = (a3/a1)^(3/2).\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final value.**\n*   P3/P1 = (10.3684)^(3/2)\n*   P3/P1 ≈ 33.38\n\nThis result is approximately 33.4.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) ~ 3.2\nB) ~ 33.4\nC) ~ 4.4\nD) ~ 10.4\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
