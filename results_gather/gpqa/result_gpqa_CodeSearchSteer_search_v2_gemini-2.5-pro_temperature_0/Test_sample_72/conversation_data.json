    "### Calculation of Relative Speed\n\nTo find the relative speed between the two astronauts moving in the same direction, we use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula. Let the velocities of the two astronauts be v1 = 0.6c and v2 = 0.5c.\n\nThe formula for relative velocity (v_rel) is:\nv_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c²)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\nv_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)\nv_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3c² / c²)\nv_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3)\nv_rel = 0.1c / 0.7\nv_rel ≈ 0.1428c\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is approximately **0.14c**.\n\n### Calculation of Total Energy\n\nThe total energy of a relativistic system is the sum of the total energies of its individual particles. The total energy (E) of a single particle is given by the equation E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass, and c is the speed of light. The Lorentz factor is calculated as γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²).\n\n**For the first astronaut (mass m1 = 2m, velocity v1 = 0.6c):**\n\n1.  Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ1):\n    γ1 = 1 / √(1 - (0.6c)²/c²)\n    γ1 = 1 / √(1 - 0.36)\n    γ1 = 1 / √0.64\n    γ1 = 1 / 0.8\n    γ1 = 1.25\n\n2.  Calculate the energy (E1):\n    E1 = γ1 * m1 * c²\n    E1 = 1.25 * (2m) * c²\n    E1 = 2.5 mc²\n\n**For the second astronaut (mass m2 = 3m, velocity v2 = 0.5c):**\n\n1.  Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ2):\n    γ2 = 1 / √(1 - (0.5c)²/c²)\n    γ2 = 1 / √(1 - 0.25)\n    γ2 = 1 / √0.75\n    γ2 = 1 / (√3 / 2)\n    γ2 = 2 / √3\n    γ2 ≈ 1.1547\n\n2.  Calculate the energy (E2):\n    E2 = γ2 * m2 * c²\n    E2 = (2 / √3) * (3m) * c²\n    E2 = (6 / √3) * mc²\n    E2 = 2√3 mc²\n    E2 ≈ 3.464 mc²\n\n**Total Energy of the System (E_total):**\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the two astronauts.\nE_total = E1 + E2\nE_total = 2.5 mc² + 2√3 mc²\nE_total = (2.5 + 2 * 1.732) mc²\nE_total = (2.5 + 3.464) mc²\nE_total ≈ 5.964 mc²\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is approximately **5.96 mc²**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated relative speed is approximately 0.14c, and the total energy of the system is approximately 5.96 mc². Comparing these results with the given options:\n\n*   A) v_rel = 0.1c , E = 4.96 mc²\n*   B) v_rel = 1.1c , E = mc²\n*   C) v_rel = 0.14c , E = 5.96 mc²\n*   D) v_rel = 0.14c, E = 5mc²\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
