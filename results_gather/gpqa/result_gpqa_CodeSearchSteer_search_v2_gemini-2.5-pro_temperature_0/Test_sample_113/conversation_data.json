    "Here is a breakdown of the reactions to determine the appropriate reagents:\n\n**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\nThis reaction is a cyanohydrin formation. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) from sodium cyanide (NaCN) acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms an alkoxide intermediate. To obtain the final product, this intermediate must be protonated. Reagent A must therefore be a proton source. An acidic workup, represented by H₃O⁺, provides the necessary proton.\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\nThis reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This transformation is typically carried out under either strong acidic or strong basic conditions with heat. Reagent B, used with water, must be a catalyst for this hydrolysis. A strong acid like hydrochloric acid (HCl) is a standard and effective reagent for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n*   **A** is **H₃O⁺**\n*   **B** is **HCl**\n\nTherefore, the correct option combines these two reagents.\n\n<<<C>>>"
