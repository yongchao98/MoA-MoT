    "This scenario requires a comparison between two different physical processes: the collision of gas molecules with each other and the scattering of high-energy electrons by those same gas molecules.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the physics involved:\n\n*   **λ1 (Mean Free Path of Gas Molecules):** This is the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with another gas molecule. This path is determined by the number density of the gas (n) and the kinetic collision cross-section of the molecules (σ₁). The cross-section, in this case, can be thought of as the effective \"size\" of the molecule for a collision, roughly related to its physical diameter.\n\n*   **λ2 (Mean Free Path of Electrons):** This is the average distance a 1000 kV electron travels before being significantly scattered by a gas molecule. This path is also determined by the number density of the gas (n) but by the electron scattering cross-section (σ₂).\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is inversely proportional to the collision cross-section (σ): λ ≈ 1/(nσ). Since the gas conditions are the same, the number density (n) is constant for both calculations. Therefore, the difference between λ1 and λ2 comes down to the difference between the two cross-sections, σ₁ and σ₂.\n\nA high-energy electron (1000 kV) is a very small, point-like particle moving at nearly the speed of light. Its interaction with a gas molecule is electromagnetic. For a significant scattering event to occur, the electron must pass very close to the atom's nucleus. In contrast, a gas-gas collision is more like a \"billiard ball\" interaction, where a collision occurs if the molecules' outer electron clouds touch.\n\nBecause the electron is so small and energetic, it can easily pass through the electron cloud of a gas molecule without a significant interaction. This means the effective target area, or scattering cross-section (σ₂), is much smaller than the kinetic cross-section for a molecule-molecule collision (σ₁).\n\nIn summary:\n*   The electron scattering cross-section is much smaller than the gas molecule kinetic cross-section (σ₂ << σ₁).\n*   Since the mean free path is inversely proportional to the cross-section, a smaller cross-section results in a longer mean free path.\n*   Therefore, the mean free path of the electron (λ₂) must be significantly greater than the mean free path of the gas molecule (λ₁).\n\nThis eliminates options C and D. Option A (λ₂ >= 1.22*λ₁) is the only choice that correctly reflects that λ₂ is substantially larger than λ₁. The actual ratio is likely much greater than 1.22, but the inequality holds true.\n\n<<<A>>>"
