    "Based on the provided spectral data, the unidentified white solid is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**. Here is a breakdown of how the evidence supports this conclusion:\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry (MS):**\n    *   The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 corresponds to the molecular weight of 4-chlorobenzoic acid (C₇H₅ClO₂).\n    *   The peak at m/z = 158, which is approximately one-third the intensity of the molecular ion peak, is the characteristic isotopic pattern for a compound containing one chlorine atom (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes).\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The very broad peak observed between 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is definitive for the O-H bond stretch in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid.\n    *   The strong, sharp absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) group of an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The singlet at a very downfield chemical shift of 11.0 ppm is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n    *   The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, one at 8.02 ppm (2H) and one at 7.72 ppm (2H), indicates a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The two protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group are shifted further downfield, while the two protons adjacent to the chlorine atom are slightly upfield. This specific pattern strongly supports the 4-chloro (or para) substitution.\n\n### Evaluation of Other Options:\n\n*   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** While it has the correct molecular weight, its ¹H NMR spectrum would be much more complex than two simple doublets due to the ortho-substitution pattern.\n*   **B) Phenyl chloroformate:** This compound is an acid chloride, not a carboxylic acid. It would lack the broad O-H peak in the IR spectrum and the acidic proton signal around 11 ppm in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n*   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This compound is an aldehyde with a phenolic hydroxyl group. It would not show the characteristic broad IR peak or the ¹H NMR signal for a carboxylic acid. The aromatic region of its NMR spectrum would also be different, showing three distinct protons with complex splitting.\n\nTherefore, the combination of all spectral data points conclusively to 4-chlorobenzoic acid as the correct structure.\n\n<<<C>>>"
