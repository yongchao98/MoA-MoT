    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and the number of its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine**\nThis reaction is the α-bromination of a ketone. One of the hydrogen atoms on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group is replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1 is 2-bromocyclohexanone.**\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide**\nWhen an α-halo ketone with an available proton on the other side of the carbonyl is treated with a strong base like sodium hydroxide, it undergoes a Favorskii rearrangement. This reaction involves the formation of a cyclopropanone intermediate, which then opens to form a ring-contracted carboxylic acid (or its salt). In this case, the six-membered ring of 2-bromocyclohexanone contracts to a five-membered ring.\n*   **Product 2 is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.**\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine**\nThis is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) is the chlorinating agent, and pyridine is a base used to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Product 3 is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.**\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride**\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)₃) is a mild reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce highly reactive acid chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to the alcohol.\n*   **Product 4 is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.**\n\n**Determining the Number of Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\n\nThe final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde (C₅H₉CHO). To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we need to analyze the molecule's symmetry. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (CHO) and the C1 carbon of the ring to which it is attached.\n\nLet's count the unique proton environments:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This proton is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)\n2.  **The proton on C1:** The hydrogen attached to the same carbon as the aldehyde group is also unique. (1 type)\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** Due to the plane of symmetry, the protons on C2 are equivalent to the protons on C5. However, the two protons on C2 itself are not equivalent; they are diastereotopic. One is *cis* to the aldehyde group, and the other is *trans*. Therefore, these represent two distinct types of hydrogens. (2 types)\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** Similarly, the protons on C3 are equivalent to those on C4. The two protons on C3 are also diastereotopic. This gives another two distinct types of hydrogens. (2 types)\n\nTotaling these up: 1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (C2/C5-H's) + 2 (C3/C4-H's) = **6** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\nTherefore, product 4 has 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<A>>>"
