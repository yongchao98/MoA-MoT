    "Quantum field theories like Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) and Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) require a process called regularization to handle infinite values that arise in calculations, particularly at high energies or, equivalently, at very short distances. Superstring Theory, on the other hand, is believed to be a theory that is free of these ultraviolet (UV) divergences.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the options:\n*   **A) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** As the quantum field theory of the strong force, QCD requires regularization to make sense of the infinities that appear in its perturbative calculations. Methods like lattice regularization are used to manage these divergences.\n*   **B) Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory faces its own divergence problem related to the self-energy of a point-like charged particle, such as an electron. While this is a high-energy/short-distance problem, the term \"regularization\" is most commonly associated with the procedure needed to handle infinities from loop diagrams in quantum field theory, which are not present in this classical theory.\n*   **C) Superstring Theory:** A key motivation for superstring theory is that it is considered a UV-finite theory. Instead of point-like particles, the fundamental objects are one-dimensional strings. This extended nature of strings smooths out interactions at short distances, which is believed to prevent the infinities that plague quantum field theories, thus eliminating the need for regularization.\n*   **D) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** QED was the first quantum field theory where the problem of infinities arose and was successfully managed through regularization and renormalization.\n\nTherefore, Superstring Theory is the one that is formulated to not require regularization for high-energy infinities.\n\n<<<C>>>"
