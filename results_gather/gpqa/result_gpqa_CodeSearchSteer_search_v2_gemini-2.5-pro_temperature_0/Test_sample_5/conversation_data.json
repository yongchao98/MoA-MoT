    "To find the energy spectrum of the quantum mechanical particle, we first need to express the given potential in Cartesian coordinates. The potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ) as:\n\nV(r, θ) = ½ kr² + ³⁄₂ kr² cos²(θ)\n\nThe transformation from polar to Cartesian coordinates is given by x = r cos(θ) and y = r sin(θ), which implies r² = x² + y² and x² = r² cos²(θ).\n\nSubstituting these into the potential energy function, we get:\n\nV(x, y) = ½ k(x² + y²) + ³⁄₂ kx²\nV(x, y) = ½ kx² + ½ ky² + ³⁄₂ kx²\nV(x, y) = (½ + ³⁄₂)kx² + ½ ky²\nV(x, y) = 2kx² + ½ ky²\n\nThis potential is separable, meaning it can be written as a sum of two independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillator potentials: V(x, y) = Vₓ(x) + Vᵧ(y).\n\nThe potential for the x-direction is Vₓ(x) = 2kx² = ½ (4k)x². This corresponds to a harmonic oscillator with an effective spring constant kₓ = 4k.\nThe potential for the y-direction is Vᵧ(y) = ½ ky². This corresponds to a harmonic oscillator with a spring constant kᵧ = k.\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator with a potential V(q) = ½ k_eff q² are given by the formula Eₙ = (n + ½)ħω, where the angular frequency ω = √(k_eff/m).\n\nFor the motion in the x-direction, the angular frequency is:\nωₓ = √(kₓ/m) = √(4k/m) = 2√(k/m)\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for the x-direction are:\nEₙₓ = (nₓ + ½)ħωₓ = (nₓ + ½)ħ(2√(k/m)) = (2nₓ + 1)ħ√(k/m)\n\nFor the motion in the y-direction, the angular frequency is:\nωᵧ = √(kᵧ/m) = √(k/m)\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for the y-direction are:\nEₙᵧ = (nᵧ + ½)ħωᵧ = (nᵧ + ½)ħ√(k/m)\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the energies for each independent dimension.\n\nE = Eₙₓ + Eₙᵧ\nE = (2nₓ + 1)ħ√(k/m) + (nᵧ + ½)ħ√(k/m)\nE = [(2nₓ + 1) + (nᵧ + ½)]ħ√(k/m)\nE = (2nₓ + nᵧ + ³⁄₂)ħ√(k/m)\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
