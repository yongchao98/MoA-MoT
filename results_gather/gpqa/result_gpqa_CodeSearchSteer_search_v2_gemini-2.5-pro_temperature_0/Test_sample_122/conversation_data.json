    "This problem requires the application of the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\nHere is a step-by-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the given information:**\n    *   The relative velocity (v) between the supernova ejecta and the center of the Galaxy is 60,000 km/s.\n    *   The time that has passed in the ejecta's own reference frame (proper time, Δt₀) is 50 seconds.\n    *   The speed of light (c) is approximately 300,000 km/s.\n\n2.  **Determine what needs to be calculated:**\n    *   The distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame.\n\n3.  **Apply the concept of time dilation:**\n    From the perspective of an observer in the Galaxy's reference frame, the time on the moving ejecta's \"clock\" runs slower. This phenomenon is called time dilation. The time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt) is longer than the proper time (Δt₀). The formula for time dilation is:\n\n    Δt = γ * Δt₀\n\n    where γ (the Lorentz factor) is calculated as:\n\n    γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\n4.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):**\n    *   First, find the ratio of the velocity to the speed of light:\n        v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2\n    *   Next, square this ratio:\n        (v/c)² = 0.2² = 0.04\n    *   Now, calculate γ:\n        γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √0.96\n        γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798\n        γ ≈ 1.0206\n\n5.  **Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (Δt):**\n    *   Using the time dilation formula:\n        Δt = 1.0206 * 50 s\n        Δt ≈ 51.03 s\n\n6.  **Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame:**\n    *   The distance (d) is the velocity multiplied by the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n        d = v * Δt\n        d = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s\n        d ≈ 3,061,800 km\n\n    *   Alternatively, a more precise calculation can be done without rounding the intermediate steps:\n        d = v * (Δt₀ / √(1 - v²/c²))\n        d = (60,000 km/s * 50 s) / √0.96\n        d = 3,000,000 km / √0.96\n        d ≈ 3,061,862 km\n\n7.  **Compare the result with the given options:**\n    *   A) 3,000,000 km\n    *   B) 2,940,000 km\n    *   C) 2,880,000 km\n    *   D) 3,060,000 km\n\nThe calculated distance of approximately 3,061,862 km is closest to option D. The slight difference is due to the rounding of the value in the provided option.\n\n<<<D>>>"
