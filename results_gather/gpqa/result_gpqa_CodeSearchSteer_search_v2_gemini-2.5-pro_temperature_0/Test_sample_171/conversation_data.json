    "The derivation of the relationship between the temperatures of the two stars relies on the Boltzmann equation, which describes the distribution of atoms among their various energy levels under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\nThe Boltzmann equation is given as:\n\nN_b / N_a = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-(E_b - E_a) / (k * T)]\n\nWhere:\n*   N_b and N_a are the number of atoms in the excited state 'b' and a lower energy state 'a', respectively.\n*   g_b and g_a are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the energy levels.\n*   E_b - E_a is the energy difference between the two levels (ΔE).\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nThe problem states that the excitation of iron atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2. This can be expressed as the ratio of the populations in the excited state to a lower state for star_1 is double that for star_2:\n\n(N_b / N_a)_1 = 2 * (N_b / N_a)_2\n\nApplying the Boltzmann equation to each star:\n\nFor star_1 (temperature T_1):\n(N_b / N_a)_1 = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\n\nFor star_2 (temperature T_2):\n(N_b / N_a)_2 = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\nBy substituting these into the ratio equation, the term for the statistical weights (g_b / g_a) cancels out:\n\nexp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\nTo solve for the temperatures, we can rearrange the equation:\n\nexp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] / exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)] = 2\n\nUsing the property of exponents, exp(x)/exp(y) = exp(x-y), we get:\n\nexp[(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) - (-ΔE / (k * T_2))] = 2\nexp[(ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)] = 2\n\nTaking the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides gives:\n\n(ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)\n\nThe problem provides the energy difference ΔE as approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J. The Boltzmann constant, k, has a defined value of exactly 1.380649 x 10⁻²³ J/K. Therefore, the ratio ΔE / k is approximately 1.\n\nSubstituting this value into the equation:\n\n1 * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)\n\nCombining the terms in the parenthesis (1/T_2 - 1/T_1 = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1*T_2)), we arrive at the final expression:\n\nln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
