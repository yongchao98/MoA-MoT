    "To determine the mass dimension of κ and the renormalizability of the theory, we first need to find the mass dimension of each term in the interaction Lagrangian.\n\n### 1. Mass Dimensions of the Fields and Lagrangian\n\nIn natural units (where ħ = c = 1), the action `S` is dimensionless. The action is defined as the integral of the Lagrangian density over four-dimensional spacetime: `S = ∫d⁴x L`.\n\n*   The spacetime differential `d⁴x` has a mass dimension of [d⁴x] = -4.\n*   For the action `S` to be dimensionless, the Lagrangian density `L` must have a mass dimension of [L] = 4.\n*   **Fermion field (ψ):** The kinetic term for a fermion field in the Dirac Lagrangian is `L_Dirac ⊃ ψ_bar * iγ^μ * ∂_μ * ψ`. For this term to have a mass dimension of 4, we have `[ψ_bar] + [ψ] + [∂_μ] = 4`. Since `[∂_μ] = 1`, we get `2[ψ] + 1 = 4`, which implies that the mass dimension of the fermion field is `[ψ] = 3/2`.\n*   **Field strength tensor (F^μν):** The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is `L_EM = -1/4 * F_μν * F^μν`. For this term to have a mass dimension of 4, we have `2[F^μν] = 4`, which means the mass dimension of the field strength tensor is `[F^μν] = 2`.\n*   **Sigma matrix (σ_μν):** The term `σ_μν` is defined as `(i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]`. The gamma matrices `γ_μ` are dimensionless matrices. Therefore, `σ_μν` is also dimensionless.\n\n### 2. Mass Dimension of the Coupling Constant (κ)\n\nThe interaction Lagrangian is given by `L_int = κ * ψ_bar * σ_μν * ψ * F^μν`. As a term in the total Lagrangian, `L_int` must also have a mass dimension of 4.\n\nWe can write the dimensional equation as:\n`[L_int] = [κ] + [ψ_bar] + [σ_μν] + [ψ] + [F^μν]`\n\nSubstituting the known mass dimensions:\n`4 = [κ] + 3/2 + 0 + 3/2 + 2`\n`4 = [κ] + 3 + 2`\n`4 = [κ] + 5`\n`[κ] = 4 - 5 = -1`\n\nSo, the mass dimension of the coupling constant κ is -1.\n\n### 3. Renormalizability of the Theory\n\nA key criterion for determining the renormalizability of a quantum field theory is the mass dimension of its coupling constants.\n\n*   If all coupling constants in the Lagrangian have a non-negative mass dimension (≥ 0), the theory is generally renormalizable (or super-renormalizable if the dimension is > 0).\n*   If any coupling constant has a negative mass dimension, the theory is non-renormalizable. This is because interactions with negative mass dimension couplings become stronger at higher energies, leading to divergences in perturbative calculations that cannot be absorbed by a finite number of counterterms.\n\nSince the mass dimension of κ is -1, which is negative, the theory described by this interaction Lagrangian is not renormalizable.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe mass dimension of κ is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
