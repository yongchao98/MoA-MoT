    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction series to determine the final product E and the number of signals in its 13C-NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF3 → A**\nPropionaldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO) reacts with 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT, HSCH₂CH₂SH) in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst (BF₃) to form a cyclic thioacetal. This reaction protects the carbonyl group.\n*   **Product A:** 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane\n\n**Step 2: A + BuLi → B**\nButyllithium (BuLi) is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton in molecule A. The proton on the carbon between the two sulfur atoms (C2) is acidic because the adjacent sulfur atoms stabilize the resulting carbanion.\n*   **Product B:** The lithium salt of the 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane carbanion.\n\n**Step 3: B + Bromoethane → C**\nThe carbanion in B is a strong nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbon of bromoethane (CH₃CH₂Br) in an SN2 reaction, adding a second ethyl group to the C2 position.\n*   **Product C:** 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane\n\n**Step 4: C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**\nThis step is the deprotection of the thioacetal. Mercuric chloride (HgCl₂) assists in the hydrolysis of the thioacetal, regenerating the carbonyl group. The carbon that was C2 of the dithiolane ring becomes the carbonyl carbon, which is attached to two ethyl groups.\n*   **Product D:** 3-Pentanone (diethyl ketone, (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O)\n\n**Step 5: D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**\nThis is a Wittig reaction. First, the Wittig reagent (an ylide) is prepared from 3-bromopentane and triphenylphosphine (PPh₃), followed by deprotonation with BuLi.\n*   **Ylide formation:** PPh₃ + (CH₃CH₂)₂CHBr → [(CH₃CH₂)₂CH-P⁺Ph₃]Br⁻ --(BuLi)--> (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃\n*   **Wittig reaction:** The ylide reacts with the ketone (3-pentanone) to form an alkene. The oxygen atom of the ketone is replaced by the carbon group from the ylide.\n    (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O + (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃ → (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂ + O=PPh₃\n*   **Product E:** 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene\n\n**13C-NMR Analysis of Product E**\nThe final product is 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene, which has the following structure:\n```\n      CH₂CH₃\n      |\nCH₃CH₂-C=C-CH₂CH₃\n      |\n      CH₂CH₃\n```\nTo determine the number of 13C-NMR signals, we must identify the number of unique carbon environments in the molecule. Due to the molecule's high degree of symmetry, several carbon atoms are chemically equivalent. The molecule has a C₂ axis of symmetry perpendicular to the C=C double bond.\n\n*   **Methyl (CH₃) carbons:** All four methyl groups are in identical chemical environments due to the molecule's symmetry. This will produce **one signal**.\n*   **Methylene (CH₂) carbons:** All four methylene groups are also in identical chemical environments. This will produce **one signal**.\n*   **Olefinic (C=C) carbons:** The two carbons of the central double bond are equivalent. This will produce **one signal**.\n\nTherefore, the 13C-NMR spectrum of 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene will show a total of 3 signals.\n\n<<<C>>>"
