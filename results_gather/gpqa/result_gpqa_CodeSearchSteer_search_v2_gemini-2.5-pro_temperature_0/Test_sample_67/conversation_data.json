    "This physical situation describes the Larmor precession of a spin in a magnetic field. Initially, the spin-1/2 particle is in an eigenstate of the Z-component of the spin operator, aligned with the magnetic field in the +Z direction. When the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction, the spin begins to precess around this new field direction.\n\nThe expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μz>`, will oscillate as the spin precesses. The frequency of this precession is known as the Larmor frequency, which is given by the formula ω = γB, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio and B is the magnitude of the magnetic field.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation:\n1.  **Initial State (t=0):** The particle is aligned with the Z-axis, so its state is the \"spin up\" eigenstate of the Sz operator, denoted as `|+z>`.\n2.  **New Hamiltonian (t>0):** The magnetic field is now `B` in the +Y direction. The Hamiltonian `H` which governs the evolution of the system is `H = -μ · B = -γ(S · B) = -γB*Sy`, where `Sy` is the spin operator for the y-component.\n3.  **Time Evolution:** The state of the particle at a later time `t` is given by `|ψ(t)> = exp(-iHt/ħ)|ψ(0)>`.\n4.  **Expectation Value:** We are interested in the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is `<μz(t)> = γ<Sz(t)> = γ<ψ(t)|Sz|ψ(t)>`.\n5.  **Calculation:** By carrying out the quantum mechanical calculation, it can be shown that `<Sz(t)>` is proportional to `cos(γBt)`.\n6.  **Frequency:** The term `cos(γBt)` describes an oscillation with an angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n\nThis frequency is independent of the initial orientation of the spin. Therefore, the average of the z-component of the particle's moment oscillates at the Larmor frequency.\n\nGiven the options:\nA) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nB) gamma*B/2\nC) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nD) gamma*B\n\nThe correct oscillation frequency is γB.\n\n<<<D>>>"
