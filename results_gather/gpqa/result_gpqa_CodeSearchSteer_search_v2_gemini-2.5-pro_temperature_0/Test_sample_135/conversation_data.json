    "To evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the vector field **f**(r), we can use the Divergence Theorem. The theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume V is equal to the surface integral of the field over the closed surface S that bounds the volume.\n\nThe vector field is given by **f**(r) = (1/r²) **r̂**, where **r̂** is the unit vector in the radial direction. The volume is a sphere of radius R centered at the origin.\n\n**Applying the Divergence Theorem**\n\nThe Divergence Theorem is expressed as:\n\n∫∫∫ (∇ ⋅ **f**) dV = ∬ (**f** ⋅ **n̂**) dS\n\nHere:\n*   V is the volume of the sphere of radius R.\n*   S is the surface of the sphere.\n*   **n̂** is the outward-pointing unit normal vector to the surface. For a sphere centered at the origin, the outward normal vector is simply the radial unit vector, **r̂**.\n*   dS is the differential element of the surface area.\n\n**Calculating the Surface Integral**\n\n1.  **Determine the field on the surface:** On the surface of the sphere, the radius r is constant and equal to R. So, the vector field **f** on the surface is (1/R²) **r̂**.\n2.  **Calculate the dot product:** The dot product **f** ⋅ **n̂** on the surface is [(1/R²) **r̂**] ⋅ **r̂**. Since **r̂** ⋅ **r̂** = 1, the dot product is 1/R².\n3.  **Evaluate the integral:** The surface integral becomes ∬ (1/R²) dS. Since R is a constant, 1/R² can be taken outside the integral: (1/R²) ∬ dS.\n4.  **Surface Area:** The integral ∬ dS is the total surface area of the sphere, which is 4πR².\n5.  **Final Result:** The value of the integral is (1/R²) * (4πR²) = 4π.\n\n**The Singularity at the Origin**\n\nA direct calculation of the divergence of **f**(r) = (1/r²) **r̂** in spherical coordinates gives ∇ ⋅ **f** = 0 for all r ≠ 0. However, the field is undefined at the origin (r=0), creating a singularity. This singularity acts as a source, and its contribution is captured by the Divergence Theorem. The divergence at the origin is technically infinite, and more formally, the divergence of this field is described by the Dirac delta function: ∇ ⋅ **f** = 4πδ³(**r**). Integrating this over the volume of the sphere, which contains the origin, yields 4π.\n\nBoth methods confirm that the value of the integral is 4π.\n\n<<<A>>>"
