    "To arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield during electrophilic bromination, we must analyze the directing effects of each substituent on the benzene ring. The formation of the para-isomer is influenced by whether the substituent is ortho-, para-directing or meta-directing, and by steric hindrance at the ortho position.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the substituents:\n*   **-NO2 (Nitrobenzene, 4), -COOH (Benzoic acid, 6), and -COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate, 2):** These are deactivating, meta-directing groups. They withdraw electron density from the ring, making electrophilic substitution difficult and directing the incoming electrophile primarily to the meta position. Consequently, the yield of the para-isomer is extremely low for these substances.\n    *   The -NO2 group is one of the strongest deactivating groups, resulting in a para-isomer yield of less than 1%.\n    *   The -COOH and -COOC2H5 groups are also strongly deactivating. For ethyl benzoate, the para-isomer yield is around 5%, while the meta-isomer is the major product (73%). For benzoic acid, the para yield is also very small, with the vast majority being the meta-isomer. Comparing the three, the order of increasing para yield is generally considered to be nitrobenzene < benzoic acid < ethyl benzoate, although all are very low.\n\n*   **-CH3 (Toluene, 1), -C2H5 (Ethylbenzene, 5), and -Cl (Chlorobenzene, 3):** These are ortho-, para-directing groups. They will all produce a significant amount of the para-isomer. The specific yield of the para-isomer versus the ortho-isomer is largely determined by steric effects.\n    *   **Toluene (-CH3, 1):** The methyl group is activating and directs to the ortho and para positions. In bromination, toluene typically yields about 30-40% ortho-isomer and the rest is almost all para-isomer, giving a para yield of about 60-70%.\n    *   **Ethylbenzene (-C2H5, 5):** The ethyl group is also activating and ortho-, para-directing. Because the ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group, it creates more steric hindrance at the ortho positions. This increased hindrance favors substitution at the less crowded para position, resulting in a higher para-isomer yield compared to toluene.\n    *   **Chlorobenzene (-Cl, 3):** The chloro group is deactivating overall but is ortho-, para-directing due to its lone pairs participating in resonance. The para-isomer is strongly favored, with conventional bromination yielding an ortho to para isomer ratio of about 0.1 to 1, which corresponds to approximately 9% ortho and 91% para.\n\nBased on this analysis, the order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n1.  **Nitrobenzene (4):** Has the lowest para yield (<1%).\n2.  **Benzoic acid (6):** Has a very low para yield, slightly higher than nitrobenzene.\n3.  **Ethyl benzoate (2):** Has a very low para yield (around 5%), but generally slightly higher than benzoic acid.\n4.  **Toluene (1):** Has a substantial para yield (~60-70%).\n5.  **Ethylbenzene (5):** Has a higher para yield than toluene due to greater steric hindrance from the ethyl group.\n6.  **Chlorobenzene (3):** Has the highest para yield (~91%) due to a strong preference for para substitution.\n\nThus, the final order is 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3.\n\n<<<A>>>"
