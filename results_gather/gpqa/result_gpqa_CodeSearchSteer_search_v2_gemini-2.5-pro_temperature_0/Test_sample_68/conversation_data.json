    "To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle $ X^{0} $, we must first calculate the particle's average decay length in the laboratory frame of reference. This involves concepts from special relativity, specifically time dilation and the Lorentz factor.\n\n### 1. Calculation of the Lorentz Factor ($ \\gamma $)\nThe Lorentz factor describes the time dilation effect for a moving particle. It is the ratio of the particle's total energy (E) to its rest mass energy ($ mc^2 $). In particle physics, mass is often given in units of GeV/$ c^2 $, so the factor can be calculated directly from the given energy and mass values.\n*   Energy (E) = 27 GeV\n*   Mass (m) = 3.41 GeV/$ c^2 $\n\nThe Lorentz factor is calculated as:\n$ \\gamma = \\frac{E}{m} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918 $\n\n### 2. Calculation of the Mean Decay Length (L)\nThe proper lifetime ($ \\tau_{0} $) of the particle is its lifetime in its own rest frame. In the laboratory frame, this lifetime is dilated by the Lorentz factor, a phenomenon known as time dilation. The lifetime in the lab frame ($ \\tau $) is $ \\tau = \\gamma \\tau_{0} $.\n\nThe mean decay length (L) is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying. For a highly relativistic particle, its velocity is very close to the speed of light (c).\n*   Proper lifetime ($ \\tau_{0} $) = $ 8 \\times 10^{-16} $ s\n*   Speed of light (c) $ \\approx 3 \\times 10^8 $ m/s\n\nThe mean decay length is calculated as:\n$ L = c \\cdot \\tau = c \\cdot \\gamma \\cdot \\tau_{0} $\n$ L = (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (7.918) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) $\n$ L \\approx 1.90 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m} $\n\n### 3. Determining the Required Resolution\nTo \"observe\" a decay, the particle's track must be distinguishable from its point of creation. This means the particle must travel a distance ($ d $) greater than the detector's spatial resolution ($ x_{res} $).\n\nThe decay of particles follows an exponential decay law. The probability that a particle travels a distance greater than $ x_{res} $ before decaying is given by $ P(d > x_{res}) = e^{-x_{res}/L} $.\n\nThe problem requires that at least 30% of the decays are observed. Therefore, the resolution must be such that:\n$ P(d > x_{res}) \\ge 0.30 $\n$ e^{-x_{res}/L} \\ge 0.30 $\n\nTo find the maximum possible resolution that satisfies this condition (which corresponds to the \"minimum\" or coarsest acceptable resolution), we solve for the equality:\n$ e^{-x_{res}/L} = 0.30 $\n$ -\\frac{x_{res}}{L} = \\ln(0.30) $\n$ x_{res} = -L \\cdot \\ln(0.30) $\n$ x_{res} \\approx -(1.90 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204) $\n$ x_{res} \\approx 2.29 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m} $\n\nThis result ($ 2.29 \\times 10^{-6} $ m) represents the largest resolution that can still observe at least 30% of the decays. Any resolution smaller than this value would observe a higher percentage of decays.\n\n### Conclusion\nComparing our calculated value with the given options:\nA) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\nB) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\nC) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\nD) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\n\nThe calculated value of $ 2.29 \\times 10^{-6} $ m is closest to option C, $ 2.08 \\times 10^{-6} $ m. The small discrepancy (approximately 10%) is likely due to a slight imprecision in the values provided in the problem statement. For instance, if the proper lifetime were $ 7.25 \\times 10^{-16} $ s instead of $ 8 \\times 10^{-16} $ s, the calculated resolution would be approximately $ 2.07 \\times 10^{-6} $ m, which matches option C almost perfectly. Given the choices, option C is the most plausible answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
