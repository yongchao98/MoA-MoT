    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2.\n\n**1. Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its host star and its distance from the star. The formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * (R_star / 2a)^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\nWhere:\n*   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n*   R_star is the star's radius.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n\nTo find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 (T_eq1) and Planet2 (T_eq2), we can set up the following equation:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (R_star / 2a₁)^(1/2) * (1 - A₁)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / 2a₂)^(1/2) * (1 - A₂)^(1/4)]\n\nSince the planets orbit the same star, T_star and R_star are constant. The problem also states that both planets have the same albedo (A₁ = A₂). Therefore, these terms cancel out, simplifying the ratio to:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a₂ / a₁)^(1/2)\n\n**2. Relating Doppler Shift to Radial Velocity**\n\nThe Doppler shift (Δλ) in the star's spectral lines is caused by the star's motion (radial velocity, v_r) induced by the orbiting planet. The relationship is:\n\nv_r = c * (Δλ / λ₀)\n\nWhere `c` is the speed of light and λ₀ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line. The maximum radial velocity, or semi-amplitude (K), corresponds to the maximum observed Doppler shift. The ratio of the semi-amplitudes for the two planets is:\n\nK₁ / K₂ = [c * (Δλ₁ / λ₀)] / [c * (Δλ₂ / λ₀)] = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂\nK₁ / K₂ = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3/4\n\n**3. Relating Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters**\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) it induces on its star is given by:\n\nK = (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * (G * M_star / a)^(1/2)\n\nWhere:\n*   M_p is the planet's mass.\n*   M_star is the star's mass.\n*   `i` is the orbital inclination.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\nSince both planets were detected using the transit method, their orbits must be viewed nearly edge-on, meaning the inclination `i` is close to 90° and sin(i) ≈ 1.\n\n**4. Determining the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a₂ / a₁)**\n\nWe can rearrange the formula for K to solve for the semi-major axis `a`:\n\nK² = (M_p² / M_star²) * (G * M_star / a)\na = (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\nNow, we can find the ratio a₂ / a₁:\n\na₂ / a₁ = [(G * M_p₂²) / (M_star * K₂²)] / [(G * M_p₁²) / (M_star * K₁²)]\n\nThe terms G and M_star cancel out, leaving:\n\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n**5. Calculation**\n\nWe are given the following values:\n*   M_p₁ = 7 M_earth\n*   M_p₂ = 5 M_earth\n*   The ratio K₁ / K₂ = 3/4 (from step 2)\n\nSubstitute these values into the equation for a₂ / a₁:\n\na₂ / a₁ = (5 / 7)² * (3 / 4)²\na₂ / a₁ = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\na₂ / a₁ = 225 / 784\n\nFinally, substitute this ratio back into the equation for the temperature ratio from step 1:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(225 / 784)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<A>>>"
