    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dicarboxylic Acid/Anhydride:** A *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride shows a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. This data is characteristic of maleic anhydride. The two equivalent alkene protons give the single ¹H peak, and the two equivalent alkene carbons (137 ppm) and two equivalent carbonyl carbons (165 ppm) give the two ¹³C peaks.\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene.\n\n2.  **The Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition, a [4+2] reaction between the diene and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n    *   When a cyclic diene and a cyclic dienophile react, a bicyclic product is formed. This reaction can produce two different stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* products.\n    *   The *endo* product is typically the major, kinetically favored product due to secondary orbital interactions in the transition state. The *exo* product is the minor, thermodynamically more stable product.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is C₁₃H₁₆O₃, which is consistent with the addition of maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (C₉H₁₄).\n\n3.  **Stereochemistry and Structure of Products:**\n    *   **Major Product (*endo* adduct):** In this isomer, the anhydride ring is oriented on the same side (*syn*) as the newly formed double bond in the six-membered ring.\n    *   **Minor Product (*exo* adduct):** In this isomer, the anhydride ring is oriented on the opposite side (*anti*) to the double bond.\n\n4.  **2D NOESY NMR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) is an NMR technique that shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å), even if they are not connected through chemical bonds.\n    *   The problem states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major product's spectrum but absent or weak in the minor product's spectrum. This indicates a pair of protons that are spatially close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n\n5.  **Structural Analysis and Proton Assignment:**\n    *   Let's analyze the structure of the major (*endo*) product to identify protons that are close in space.\n        *   **Protons from Maleic Anhydride:** These two protons are attached to the carbons that were part of the dienophile's double bond. Due to the molecule's symmetry, they are equivalent and will appear as a **2H singlet**. They are adjacent to electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups, so their chemical shift will be downfield, around **~3.5 ppm**.\n        *   **Methyl Protons:** There are two sets of methyl groups.\n            *   **Vinyl Methyls:** Two methyl groups are attached to the carbons of the double bond. They are equivalent due to symmetry and will appear as a **6H singlet**. Their chemical shift is typically in the vinylic methyl region, around **~1.7 ppm**.\n            *   **Bridgehead Methyls:** Two methyl groups are on the bridgehead carbons. They are also equivalent and will appear as another **6H singlet**. Being on saturated carbons, they will be further upfield, around **~1.0 ppm**.\n    *   **Spatial Proximity:**\n        *   In the **major (*endo*) product**, the two anhydride protons (at ~3.5 ppm) are held underneath the C=C double bond, bringing them very close to the two vinyl methyl groups (at ~1.7 ppm). This proximity will generate a strong NOESY cross-peak.\n        *   In the **minor (*exo*) product**, the anhydride protons are pointing away from the C=C double bond. They are distant from the vinyl methyl groups, so no significant NOESY cross-peak would be observed between them.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The differentiating cross-peak, present in the major product and absent in the minor, connects the anhydride protons with the vinyl methyl protons. Based on the chemical shift and integration assignments:\n    *   The anhydride protons are the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   The vinyl methyl protons are the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak connects these two resonances.\n\n<<<A>>>"
