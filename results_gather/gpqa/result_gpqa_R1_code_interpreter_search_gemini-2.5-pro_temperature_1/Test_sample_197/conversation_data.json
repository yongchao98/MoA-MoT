    "This problem requires us to calculate the percentage of a specific cobalt complex, dithiocyanato cobalt(II) or [Co(SCN)2], relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify all cobalt species:** The total cobalt in the solution, c(Co), is distributed among several species due to complex formation with thiocyanate ions (SCN-). These species are the free hydrated cobalt ion, Co(H2O)6^2+ (which we'll denote as Co^2+ for simplicity), and the various thiocyanato complexes: [Co(SCN)]+, [Co(SCN)2], [Co(SCN)3]-, and [Co(SCN)4]2-.\n\n2.  **Write the expression for total cobalt concentration:**\n    c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)]+ + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3]- + [Co(SCN)4]2-\n\n3.  **Use the overall stability constants (βn):** The concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration [Co^2+], the free thiocyanate ligand concentration [SCN-], and the corresponding stability constant βn.\n    *   [Co(SCN)]+ = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]\n    *   [Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2\n    *   [Co(SCN)3]- = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3\n    *   [Co(SCN)4]2- = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4\n\n4.  **Substitute these expressions into the total concentration equation:**\n    c(Co) = [Co^2+] + β1[Co^2+][SCN-] + β2[Co^2+][SCN-]^2 + β3[Co^2+][SCN-]^3 + β4[Co^2+][SCN-]^4\n    By factoring out [Co^2+], we get:\n    c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)\n\n5.  **Calculate the fraction (α2) of the desired complex:** The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex, [Co(SCN)2], is the ratio of its concentration to the total cobalt concentration. This fraction is often denoted as α2.\n    α2 = [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)\n\n    Substituting the expressions from steps 3 and 4:\n    α2 = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4))\n\n    The [Co^2+] term cancels out, simplifying the equation:\n    α2 = (β2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)\n\n6.  **Plug in the given values and calculate:**\n    *   [SCN-] = 0.1 M\n    *   β1 = 9\n    *   β2 = 40\n    *   β3 = 63\n    *   β4 = 16\n\n    We will use a Python script to perform the calculation accurately.\n\n```python\n# Given stability constants\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\n\n# Given free thiocyanate concentration\nL = 0.1  # [SCN-]\n\n# The denominator of the alpha fraction is the sum of all terms in the distribution equation.\n# Let's call it 'S'. The terms are for Co2+, [Co(SCN)]+, [Co(SCN)2], [Co(SCN)3]-, and [Co(SCN)4]2-.\n# S = 1*L^0 + beta1*L^1 + beta2*L^2 + beta3*L^3 + beta4*L^4\n# where the first term (1*L^0) corresponds to the free Co2+ ion.\ndenominator = 1 + beta1*L + beta2*(L**2) + beta3*(L**3) + beta4*(L**4)\n\n# The numerator is the term corresponding to the species of interest, [Co(SCN)2].\nnumerator = beta2 * (L**2)\n\n# Calculate the fraction alpha_2\nalpha2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(f\"The percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is: {percentage:.1f}%\")\n```\n\nThe percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is: 16.9%\n\nThe calculation shows that the fraction of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is approximately 0.169, which corresponds to 16.9%.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "This problem requires calculating the distribution of cobalt species in a solution containing thiocyanate ions. The percentage of a specific complex, in this case, dithiocyanato cobalt(II) or `[Co(SCN)2]`, is determined by its fraction relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species. This fraction, denoted as α₂, can be calculated using the stability constants and the concentration of the free ligand.\n\n**1. Define the species and equilibria:**\nThe total cobalt concentration, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of the free Co(II) ion and all its thiocyanato complexes:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)]⁺ + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ + [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n\nThe formation of each complex is described by an overall stability constant (βₙ):\n`[Co(SCN)ₙ]²⁻ⁿ = βₙ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]ⁿ`\n\n**2. Formulate the fraction of the desired complex (α₂):**\nThe fraction of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, is given by:\n`α₂ = [Co(SCN)₂] / c(Co)`\n\nBy substituting the expressions for each species in terms of `[Co²⁺]`, `[SCN⁻]`, and the stability constants, the `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, leaving an equation that depends only on the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]` and the β values:\n`α₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**3. Substitute the given values:**\n*   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M (Since the ligand concentration is much higher than the metal ion concentration, we can assume the free ligand concentration is approximately equal to the total ligand concentration).\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\n**4. Calculation:**\nThe Python script executed the following calculation:\n\n*   **Numerator:** `β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n*   **Denominator:**\n    *   `1` (for free Co²⁺)\n    *   `β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n    *   `β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4`\n    *   `β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 0.063`\n    *   `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016`\n*   **Sum of Denominator:** `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n*   **Fraction (α₂):** `0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n*   **Percentage:** `0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%`\n\nThe calculation shows that 16.9% of the total cobalt in the solution exists as the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex.\n\n<<<C>>>"
