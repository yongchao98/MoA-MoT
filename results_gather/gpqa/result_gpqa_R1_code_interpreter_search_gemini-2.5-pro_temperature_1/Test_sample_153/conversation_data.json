    "*   **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the molecule with the most abundant isotopes.\n    *   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak. The ratio of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is approximately 100:32, which simplifies to about 3:1. This isotopic pattern is a classic signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom, as the natural abundance of chlorine isotopes is ~75% ³⁵Cl and ~25% ³⁷Cl.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (containing ³⁵Cl) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   A very broad peak spanning from 3500 cm⁻¹ to 2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The extreme broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Its position is consistent with a carboxylic acid that is part of an aromatic system.\n    *   Together, these two peaks are definitive evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** This signal is very far downfield, in the typical region for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). It is a singlet ('s') because this proton is not typically coupled to other protons, and it integrates to one proton ('1H'). This confirms the presence of the carboxylic acid group.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). There are a total of 4 aromatic protons (2H + 2H). The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is highly indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring. In this pattern, the two protons on one side of the ring are chemically equivalent, and the two protons on the other side are also equivalent. They split each other, resulting in two distinct doublets.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. It would lack the very broad IR peak and the ¹H NMR signal at 11.0 ppm. Incorrect.\n    *   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n        *   **Structure:** A benzene ring substituted with a carboxylic acid group and a chlorine atom at the 1 and 4 (para) positions.\n        *   **MS:** The molecular formula is C₇H₅ClO₂. The molecular weight with ³⁵Cl is 7(12) + 5(1) + 35 + 2(16) = 156. This matches the MS data, including the M+2 peak for the chlorine isotope.\n        *   **IR:** It is a carboxylic acid, which matches the IR spectrum perfectly.\n        *   **¹H NMR:** It is a para-substituted benzene ring, which would produce the observed pattern of two doublets for the 4 aromatic protons. It also has the carboxylic acid proton that appears at 11.0 ppm. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an ortho-substituted ring. While it is a carboxylic acid and has the correct molecular weight, the 4 aromatic protons would have a much more complex splitting pattern in the ¹H NMR, not two simple doublets. Incorrect.\n    *   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is an ester, not a carboxylic acid. It would lack the broad O-H peak in the IR and the -COOH proton signal at 11.0 ppm in the ¹H NMR. Incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:** All spectral data are consistent with the structure of 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>"
