    "A compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicators of chirality are the absence of a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   This molecule has a double bond. The atoms involved in the double bond (C1, C2) and the atoms directly attached to them (Cl, H, CH3, C of ethyl) lie in a single plane. This plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the entire molecule.\n    *   There are no stereocenters (chiral centers) in this molecule.\n    *   Since it has a plane of symmetry, it is achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   The name itself specifies the absolute configuration at two stereocenters (3aR, 7aS). When a specific stereoisomer is named with R/S designations, it refers to a single enantiomer.\n    *   A single enantiomer is, by definition, chiral and optically active, unless it is a meso compound.\n    *   A meso compound has stereocenters but is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. This typically occurs when the stereocenters have opposite configurations (e.g., R and S) and the substituents are arranged symmetrically.\n    *   The parent structure, hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione (a norbornane derivative), is a meso compound. However, the presence of the `8-(chloromethylene)` substituent on the methano-bridge breaks this internal symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is chiral. As the name specifies a single enantiomer, it will be optically active.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   It has two stereocenters, at C2 and C3.\n    *   The substituents on C2 (`H`, `CH3`, `COOH`, and the rest of the molecule) are identical to the substituents on C3.\n    *   The configuration is given as (2R, 3S). When a molecule has two identical stereocenters with opposite configurations, it is a meso compound.\n    *   Meso compounds have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion and are achiral despite having stereocenters.\n    *   Drawing this molecule in an eclipsed conformation reveals a plane of symmetry between C2 and C3.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically inactive** (meso compound).\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a stereoisomer of the previous compound.\n    *   It has two identical stereocenters (C2 and C3), but this time they have the same absolute configuration (R,R).\n    *   This molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is chiral.\n    *   Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) isomer, and they are a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   The named compound, (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, is a single enantiomer.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond and an alcohol group.\n    *   The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: `-OH`, `-H`, `-CH2-CH2-` (part of the ring), and `-CH=CH-` (part of the ring). Therefore, C1 is a stereocenter.\n    *   A molecule with a single stereocenter is always chiral.\n    *   The name specifies the (R) enantiomer.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups. The notation `(1s,3s,5s)` is an older form, generally indicating that all substituents have the same relative orientation, i.e., they are all `cis` to each other (all pointing \"up\" or all pointing \"down\" relative to the ring plane).\n    *   In a chair conformation, this corresponds to all three -OH groups being axial or all being equatorial.\n    *   This highly symmetric arrangement results in multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane can pass through one C-OH bond and the opposite C-H bond.\n    *   Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure is `(Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   We need to check for any stereocenters.\n    *   The carbonyl carbon is sp2 hybridized and not a stereocenter.\n    *   In the cyclopentyl ring, no carbon is bonded to four different groups.\n    *   In the 3-methylbutyl chain, C2 and C3 are -CH2- groups. C4 is bonded to an H, a -CH2-CH2-(...) group, and two identical methyl groups, so it is not a stereocenter.\n    *   Since there are no stereocenters and no other elements of chirality (like axial or planar chirality), the molecule is achiral. It has a plane of symmetry in certain conformations.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically inactive**.\n\nSummary:\n- Optically active compounds: 2, 4, 5.\n- Optically inactive compounds: 1, 3, 6, 7.\n\nThere are 3 compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<B>>>"
