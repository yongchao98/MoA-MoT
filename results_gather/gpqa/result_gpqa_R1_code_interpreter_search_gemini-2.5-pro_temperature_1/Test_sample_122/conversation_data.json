    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Problem**\n\n*   We have two inertial frames of reference:\n    *   Frame S: The Galaxy's reference frame (we can consider this the \"stationary\" frame).\n    *   Frame S': The supernova ejecta's reference frame (the \"moving\" frame).\n*   The relative velocity between the two frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   A time interval of `Δt' = 50 s` is measured in the ejecta's frame (S'). This is the *proper time* (`Δτ`) because it's measured by a clock that is stationary within that frame.\n*   The goal is to find the distance `d` traveled by the ejecta as measured from the Galaxy's frame (S).\n\n**2. Identify the Physics Principles**\n\nThis is a classic special relativity problem involving time dilation.\n\n*   **Distance Formula:** In any given reference frame, distance is velocity multiplied by time (`d = v * t`). To find the distance in the Galaxy frame (S), we need the velocity `v` and the time elapsed `Δt` *in the Galaxy frame*.\n*   **Time Dilation:** The time interval measured in a stationary frame (`Δt`) is longer than the time interval measured in a moving frame (the proper time `Δt'`). The relationship is given by the time dilation formula:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n    where `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n*   `c` is the speed of light, which is approximately `300,000 km/s`.\n\n**3. Formulate the Solution**\n\n1.  We need to calculate the distance `d` in the Galaxy frame (S). The formula is `d = v * Δt`.\n2.  We know `v = 60,000 km/s`, but we don't know `Δt` (the time in the Galaxy frame).\n3.  We can find `Δt` using the time dilation formula, as we know the proper time `Δt' = 50 s`.\n    `Δt = Δt' / √(1 - v²/c²) `\n4.  Substitute this expression for `Δt` back into the distance formula:\n    `d = v * (Δt' / √(1 - v²/c²))`\n    `d = (v * Δt') / √(1 - v²/c²) `\n\n**4. Perform the Calculation**\n\nNow, we plug in the values. It's helpful to use a computer for precision.\n\n*   `v = 60,000 km/s`\n*   `Δt' = 50 s`\n*   `c = 300,000 km/s`\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the constants from the problem\nv = 60000  # velocity of ejecta in km/s\ndt_prime = 50  # proper time in the ejecta's frame in s\nc = 300000  # speed of light in km/s\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the ratio v/c (beta)\nbeta = v / c\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the term inside the square root\nterm = 1 - beta**2\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the denominator of the full equation\ndenominator = math.sqrt(term)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the numerator (distance in classical physics)\nnumerator = v * dt_prime\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the final distance in the Galaxy's frame\ndistance = numerator / denominator\n\nprint(f\"{distance:.0f}\")\n```\n\nExecution of the code will yield the following result:\n```\n3061862\n```\nThe calculated distance is 3,061,862 km.\n\n**5. Compare with Options and Final Answer**\n\nThe calculated distance is `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`. Let's compare this to the given options:\nA) 2,940,000 km\nB) 2,880,000 km\nC) 3,000,000 km (This would be the answer if we ignored relativistic effects)\nD) 3,060,000 km\n\nThe calculated value of 3,061,862 km is closest to 3,060,000 km.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The user wants me to solve a special relativity problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe question asks for the distance traveled by supernova ejecta as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame.\n\n**2. Identify the Given Information:**\n*   Relative velocity `v` between the ejecta's frame and the Galaxy's frame: `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   Time elapsed in the ejecta's reference frame (`Δt'` or proper time `τ`): `Δt' = 50 s`.\n*   The speed of light, `c`, is a constant, approximately `300,000 km/s`.\n\n**3. Choose the Right Physics Principle:**\nThis problem involves measurements made from two different inertial reference frames moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light. This is a classic application of the theory of special relativity. Specifically, we need to account for time dilation.\n\n*   **Time Dilation:** A clock moving relative to an observer is measured to tick slower than a clock that is stationary with respect to the observer. The time measured in the moving frame (`Δt'`) is called the proper time. The time measured in the stationary frame (`Δt`) is related by the Lorentz factor, `γ`.\n    *   `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n    *   The Lorentz factor `γ` is defined as `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n*   **Distance Calculation:** The distance `d` measured in the Galaxy's frame is the velocity `v` (which is the same for both frames, just in opposite directions) multiplied by the time `Δt` measured in the Galaxy's frame.\n    *   `d = v * Δt`\n\n**4. Plan the Calculation Steps:**\n1.  Calculate the ratio `v/c`.\n2.  Calculate the Lorentz factor, `γ = 1 / √(1 - (v/c)²)`\n3.  Calculate the time `Δt` in the Galaxy's frame using `Δt = γ * Δt'`.\n4.  Calculate the distance `d` in the Galaxy's frame using `d = v * Δt`.\n\n**5. Execute the Calculation (using the Python code I already generated and executed):**\n\n*   **Input values:**\n    *   `v = 60000` km/s\n    *   `Δt' = 50` s\n    *   `c = 300000` km/s\n\n*   **Step 1: Ratio `v/c`**\n    *   `v/c = 60000 / 300000 = 0.2`\n\n*   **Step 2: Lorentz factor `γ`**\n    *   `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n    *   `√0.96 ≈ 0.9797959`\n    *   `γ ≈ 1 / 0.9797959 ≈ 1.02062`\n\n*   **Step 3: Time `Δt` in Galaxy frame**\n    *   `Δt = γ * Δt' ≈ 1.02062 * 50 s ≈ 51.031 s`\n\n*   **Step 4: Distance `d` in Galaxy frame**\n    *   `d = v * Δt ≈ 60000 km/s * 51.031 s ≈ 3,061,860 km`\n\nThe code output was `3061862`, which is a more precise version of this manual calculation.\n\n**6. Compare with the Options:**\n*   Calculated distance: `3,061,862 km`\n*   Option A: 2,940,000 km\n*   Option B: 2,880,000 km\n*   Option C: 3,000,000 km (This is the non-relativistic answer: `60,000 km/s * 50 s`)\n*   Option D: 3,060,000 km\n\nThe calculated value `3,061,862 km` is extremely close to option D, `3,060,000 km`. The small difference is likely due to rounding in the problem's option creation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reasoning is sound, the physics principles are correctly applied, and the calculation is accurate. The result matches one of the provided options.\n\n<<<D>>>"
