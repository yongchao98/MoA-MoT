    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe problem asks for two quantities for a system of two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds:\na) The relative speed (`v_rel`) between them.\nb) The total energy (`E_total`) of the system.\n\n**2. List the Given Information:**\n*   Mass of the first astronaut, `m1 = 2m`\n*   Speed of the first astronaut, `v1 = 0.6c` (in the positive x-direction)\n*   Mass of the second astronaut, `m2 = 3m`\n*   Speed of the second astronaut, `v2 = 0.5c` (in the positive x-direction)\n*   `c` is the speed of light.\n\n**3. Calculate the Relative Speed (`v_rel`):**\nFor objects moving in the same direction, the relativistic velocity subtraction formula is used to find the relative speed as observed from one of the objects' frames of reference.\n\nThe formula is:\n`v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)`\n\nSubstitute the given values into the formula:\n`v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.30c^2 / c^2)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.30)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.70`\n`v_rel ≈ 0.142857c`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Energy (`E_total`):**\nThe total energy of a relativistic object is given by `E = γmc^2`, where `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)`.\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual energies of the two astronauts.\n`E_total = E1 + E2`\n\n**a. Calculate the energy of the first astronaut (`E1`):**\n*   First, find the Lorentz factor `γ1` for the first astronaut:\n    `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v1^2 / c^2)`\n    `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2 / c^2)`\n    `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36)`\n    `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(0.64)`\n    `γ1 = 1 / 0.8`\n    `γ1 = 1.25`\n*   Now, calculate the energy `E1`:\n    `E1 = γ1 * m1 * c^2`\n    `E1 = 1.25 * (2m) * c^2`\n    `E1 = 2.5 mc^2`\n\n**b. Calculate the energy of the second astronaut (`E2`):**\n*   First, find the Lorentz factor `γ2` for the second astronaut:\n    `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v2^2 / c^2)`\n    `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2 / c^2)`\n    `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25)`\n    `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(0.75)`\n    `γ2 ≈ 1 / 0.866`\n    `γ2 ≈ 1.1547`\n*   Now, calculate the energy `E2`:\n    `E2 = γ2 * m2 * c^2`\n    `E2 ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c^2`\n    `E2 ≈ 3.4641 mc^2`\n\n**c. Calculate the total energy `E_total`:**\n*   Sum the individual energies:\n    `E_total = E1 + E2`\n    `E_total = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.4641 mc^2`\n    `E_total = (2.5 + 3.4641) mc^2`\n    `E_total = 5.9641 mc^2`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, `E_total ≈ 5.96 mc^2`.\n\n**5. Compare with Options:**\n*   Calculated `v_rel` ≈ `0.14c`\n*   Calculated `E_total` ≈ `5.96 mc^2`\n\nThese results match option D.\n\nA) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\nB) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\nC) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\nD) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
