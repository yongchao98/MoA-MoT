    "This is a classic particle physics problem involving a two-body decay at rest. We need to apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n**1. Understand the decay process:**\nThe reaction is a positive pion ($Pi^+$) decaying into a positive muon ($mu^+$) and a muon neutrino ($nu$).\n$Pi^+ -> mu^+ + nu$\n\n**2. List the given information:**\n- The pion ($Pi^+$) is stationary, which means its initial momentum is zero ($p_{Pi} = 0$) and its initial kinetic energy is zero.\n- Rest mass of $Pi^+$ ($m_{Pi}c^2$) = 139.6 MeV\n- Rest mass of $mu^+$ ($m_{mu}c^2$) = 105.7 MeV\n- The rest mass of the neutrino ($m_{nu}c^2$) is assumed to be zero, which is a standard approximation in such problems.\n\n**3. Apply Conservation of Momentum:**\nThe total momentum before the decay is zero. Therefore, the total momentum after the decay must also be zero.\n$p_{initial} = p_{final}$\n$0 = \\vec{p}_{mu} + \\vec{p}_{nu}$\nThis implies that the muon and the neutrino must travel in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let's call this momentum magnitude 'p'.\n$|\\vec{p}_{mu}| = |\\vec{p}_{nu}| = p$\n\n**4. Apply Conservation of Energy:**\nThe total energy before the decay is just the rest energy of the stationary pion. The total energy after the decay is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n$E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n$E_{Pi} = E_{mu} + E_{nu}$\n\nThe total energy of a particle is given by the relativistic formula $E = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2}$.\n\n- For the initial pion: $E_{Pi} = m_{Pi}c^2 = 139.6$ MeV\n- For the final muon: $E_{mu} = \\sqrt{(p_c)^2 + (m_{mu}c^2)^2}$\n- For the final neutrino (with $m_{nu} = 0$): $E_{nu} = \\sqrt{(p_c)^2 + 0} = pc$\n\nSubstituting these into the energy conservation equation:\n$m_{Pi}c^2 = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{mu}c^2)^2} + pc$\n\n**5. Solve for the momentum (pc):**\nWe can rearrange the equation to solve for the unknown momentum term, $pc$.\n$m_{Pi}c^2 - pc = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{mu}c^2)^2}$\n\nSquare both sides of the equation:\n$(m_{Pi}c^2 - pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{mu}c^2)^2$\n$(m_{Pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{Pi}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{mu}c^2)^2$\n\nThe $(pc)^2$ term cancels out on both sides:\n$(m_{Pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{Pi}c^2)(pc) = (m_{mu}c^2)^2$\n\nNow, isolate $pc$:\n$2(m_{Pi}c^2)(pc) = (m_{Pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{mu}c^2)^2$\n$pc = \\frac{(m_{Pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{mu}c^2)^2}{2(m_{Pi}c^2)}$\n\n**6. Calculate the numerical value of pc:**\nPlug in the given rest mass values:\n$pc = \\frac{(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2}{2 \\times 139.6}$\n$pc = \\frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{279.2}$\n$pc = \\frac{8315.67}{279.2} \\approx 29.784$ MeV\n\n**7. Calculate the Kinetic Energies (KE):**\nThe kinetic energy of a particle is its total energy minus its rest energy ($KE = E - m_0c^2$).\n\n- **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino ($KE_{nu}$):**\nSince the neutrino's rest mass is zero, its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy.\n$KE_{nu} = E_{nu} = pc \\approx 29.784$ MeV\nRounding this gives **29.8 MeV**.\n\n- **Kinetic Energy of the Muon ($KE_{mu}$):**\nFirst, find the total energy of the muon using the conservation of energy:\n$E_{mu} = E_{Pi} - E_{nu}$\n$E_{mu} = 139.6 \\text{ MeV} - 29.784 \\text{ MeV} = 109.816$ MeV\nNow, calculate the kinetic energy of the muon:\n$KE_{mu} = E_{mu} - m_{mu}c^2$\n$KE_{mu} = 109.816 \\text{ MeV} - 105.7 \\text{ MeV} = 4.116$ MeV\nRounding this gives **4.12 MeV**.\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. These values correspond to option C.\n\nThe following Python code confirms the calculation:\n```python\nm_pi = 139.6  # MeV/c^2\nm_mu = 105.7  # MeV/c^2\n\n# Calculate the momentum (pc) of the products\npc = (m_pi**2 - m_mu**2) / (2 * m_pi)\n\n# The kinetic energy of the massless neutrino is equal to its momentum (pc)\nke_nu = pc\n\n# The total energy of the muon\ne_mu = m_pi - ke_nu\n\n# The kinetic energy of the muon\nke_mu = e_mu - m_mu\n\nprint(f\"KE of muon (mu+): {ke_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"KE of neutrino (nu): {ke_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\nExecution Output:\n```\nKE of muon (mu+): 4.12 MeV\nKE of neutrino (nu): 29.78 MeV\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem asks for the kinetic energies of the product particles in the decay of a stationary positive pion ($Pi^+$) into a positive muon ($mu^+$) and a muon neutrino ($nu$).\n\nThe decay process is:\n$Pi^+ \\rightarrow mu^+ + nu$\n\n**1. Given Information:**\n*   Rest mass of $Pi^+$ ($m_{\\pi}c^2$) = 139.6 MeV\n*   Rest mass of $mu^+$ ($m_{\\mu}c^2$) = 105.7 MeV\n*   The $Pi^+$ is stationary, so its initial momentum is 0.\n*   The rest mass of the neutrino ($m_{\\nu}c^2$) is considered to be 0 for this calculation, which is a standard approximation.\n\n**2. Applying Conservation Laws:**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    Since the initial pion is at rest (momentum = 0), the total momentum of the products must also be zero. This means the muon and the neutrino must fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n    Let $p$ be the magnitude of the momentum of both the muon and the neutrino.\n    $p_{\\mu} = p_{\\nu} = p$\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:**\n    The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n    $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    The initial energy is the rest energy of the stationary pion:\n    $E_{initial} = m_{\\pi}c^2$\n    The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino:\n    $E_{final} = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$\n    where the total energy of a particle is given by the relativistic formula $E = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2}$.\n\n    So, the conservation of energy equation is:\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 = \\sqrt{(p_{\\mu}c)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2} + \\sqrt{(p_{\\nu}c)^2 + (m_{\\nu}c^2)^2}$\n    Substituting $p_{\\mu} = p_{\\nu} = p$ and $m_{\\nu}c^2 = 0$:\n    $m_{\\pi}c^2 = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2} + pc$\n\n**3. Solving for the Momentum (pc):**\nWe can rearrange the energy equation to solve for $pc$:\n$m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}$\n\nSquare both sides:\n$(m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n$(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc) + (pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2$\n\nCancel the $(pc)^2$ term from both sides and solve for $pc$:\n$(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2 = 2(m_{\\pi}c^2)(pc)$\n$pc = \\frac{(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}{2(m_{\\pi}c^2)}$\n\n**4. Calculating the Kinetic Energies (KE):**\nThe kinetic energy is defined as $KE = E_{total} - m_0c^2$.\n\n*   **KE of the Neutrino ($KE_{\\nu}$):**\n    Since the neutrino's rest mass is zero, its total energy is purely kinetic.\n    $KE_{\\nu} = E_{\\nu} = pc$\n    Using the values from the code output:\n    $KE_{\\nu} \\approx 29.78 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n*   **KE of the Muon ($KE_{\\mu}$):**\n    The total energy released in the decay is the difference in rest masses, which is converted into the kinetic energy of the products.\n    $Q = KE_{\\mu} + KE_{\\nu} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - m_{\\mu}c^2$\n    Wait, this is incorrect. The energy released is $m_{\\pi}c^2 - (m_{\\mu}c^2 + m_{\\nu}c^2)$. The kinetic energy is this value, distributed between the products.\n    The correct way is:\n    $KE_{\\mu} = E_{\\mu} - m_{\\mu}c^2$\n    From conservation of energy, $E_{\\mu} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - E_{\\nu} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc$.\n    So, $KE_{\\mu} = (m_{\\pi}c^2 - pc) - m_{\\mu}c^2$\n    Using the values from the code output:\n    $KE_{\\mu} \\approx 4.12 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**5. Conclusion:**\nThe calculated kinetic energies are:\n*   $KE_{\\mu} \\approx 4.12$ MeV\n*   $KE_{\\nu} \\approx 29.8$ MeV (rounding 29.78)\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\nA) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nB) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nC) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\nD) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
