    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n**Part 1: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism (A)**\n\nTautomerism, specifically keto-enol tautomerism, is an equilibrium between a keto form (containing a C=O bond) and an enol form (containing a C=C bond adjacent to an -OH group). This process requires the presence of an \"alpha-hydrogen,\" which is a hydrogen atom on a carbon atom adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl group. Crucially, this alpha-carbon must be sp3-hybridized.\n\nLet's analyze the two compounds given for part A:\n\n1.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a six-membered ring with three ketone (C=O) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are methylene groups (-CH2-).\n    *   **Alpha-hydrogens:** Each ketone group has two adjacent alpha-carbons. For example, the ketone at C1 has alpha-carbons at C2 and C6. Both C2 and C6 are sp3-hybridized and each has two hydrogen atoms.\n    *   **Tautomerism:** Because it possesses alpha-hydrogens on sp3-hybridized carbons, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. In fact, it can tautomerize multiple times to form 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is an aromatic and therefore very stable compound. The equilibrium strongly favors this aromatic enol form.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione *does* show tautomerism.\n\n2.  **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a six-membered ring with two ketone (C=O) groups at positions 1 and 4, and two carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) at positions 2-3 and 5-6.\n    *   **Alpha-hydrogens:** The carbons alpha (adjacent) to the ketone groups are the carbons involved in the double bonds (C2, C3, C5, C6). These carbons are all sp2-hybridized.\n    *   **Tautomerism:** Benzoquinone lacks any sp3-hybridized alpha-carbons. Therefore, it does not have the necessary type of alpha-hydrogens to undergo standard keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone does *not* show tautomerism.\n\n**Therefore, compound (A) is benzoquinone.**\n\n**Part 2: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism (B)**\n\nOptical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature leading to chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\nLet's analyze the two compounds given for part B:\n\n1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** The chemical formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. Let's examine carbon-2 (the one bonded to the -OH group).\n    *   **Groups attached to C2:**\n        1.  -H (hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH3 (methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH3 (methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   **Chirality:** Since carbon-2 is bonded to four distinctly different groups, it is a chiral center. A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a chiral molecule and *will* show optical isomerism (it exists as two enantiomers).\n\n2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, where the two ester groups (-COOCH3) are in a *trans* position across the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Chirality:** The molecule is planar. It has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and also a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. Molecules with a plane of symmetry or a center of symmetry are achiral. There are no chiral centers in the molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is an achiral molecule and does *not* show optical isomerism.\n\n**Therefore, compound (B) is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.**\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\n*   The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   The compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
