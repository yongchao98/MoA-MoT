    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Quantum Mechanical Operators:**\n    The problem provides the components of the operator $\\vec{P}$:\n    $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    These are the spin angular momentum operators for a spin-1/2 particle, where $\\vec{P} = \\vec{S} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\vec{\\sigma}$, and $\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$ are the Pauli matrices.\n\n2.  **Define the Direction Vector:**\n    The direction $\\vec{n}$ is an arbitrary unit vector in the x-z plane. In spherical coordinates, a general unit vector is $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi, \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi, \\cos\\theta)$. For a vector in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero, which means $\\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi = 0$. This implies $\\phi = 0$ or $\\phi = \\pi$. By convention, we can take $\\phi=0$, which covers all directions in the x-z plane as $\\theta$ varies from $0$ to $2\\pi$ (or more commonly, $\\theta$ from $0$ to $\\pi$ and allowing the x-component to be positive or negative).\n    So, the unit vector is $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$.\n\n3.  **Construct the Operator along the Direction $\\vec{n}$:**\n    The operator for the spin component along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is the dot product $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$.\n    $P_n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n    $P_n = P_x \\sin\\theta + P_y(0) + P_z \\cos\\theta$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta + \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta$\n    Combining the matrices:\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n4.  **Set Up and Solve the Eigenvalue Equation:**\n    We need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ that satisfies the eigenvalue equation $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$, where the eigenvalue $\\lambda$ is given as $+\\hbar/2$.\n    $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n    We can cancel the factor $\\hbar/2$ from both sides:\n    $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n    This gives us a system of two linear equations:\n    1) $a\\cos\\theta + b\\sin\\theta = a$\n    2) $a\\sin\\theta - b\\cos\\theta = b$\n\n    From equation (1):\n    $b\\sin\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n    Using the half-angle identities $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$ and $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$:\n    $b(2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)) = a(2\\sin^2(\\theta/2))$\n    Assuming $\\theta \\neq 0$ (so $\\sin(\\theta/2) \\neq 0$), we can divide by $2\\sin(\\theta/2)$:\n    $b\\cos(\\theta/2) = a\\sin(\\theta/2)$\n    This gives the relationship between the components $a$ and $b$:\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n    So, $b = a \\tan(\\theta/2)$. The eigenvector is of the form $\\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ a \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n5.  **Normalize the Eigenvector:**\n    The eigenvector must be normalized, meaning its norm (length) is 1. The normalization condition is $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1$.\n    $|a|^2 + |a \\tan(\\theta/2)|^2 = 1$\n    $|a|^2 (1 + \\tan^2(\\theta/2)) = 1$\n    Using the trigonometric identity $1 + \\tan^2(x) = \\sec^2(x)$:\n    $|a|^2 \\sec^2(\\theta/2) = 1$\n    $|a|^2 = \\frac{1}{\\sec^2(\\theta/2)} = \\cos^2(\\theta/2)$\n    $|a| = |\\cos(\\theta/2)|$\n    By convention, we can choose the overall phase of the eigenvector to be 1, so we take the positive real root, $a = \\cos(\\theta/2)$.\n    Now we find $b$:\n    $b = a \\tan(\\theta/2) = \\cos(\\theta/2) \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\sin(\\theta/2)$\n\n6.  **Final Eigenvector and Conclusion:**\n    The normalized eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$ is:\n    $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n    The elements of this eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n    Comparing this result with the given options:\n    A) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar)$ - Incorrect dimensions and normalization.\n    B) $(\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta))$ - Incorrect functional form (depends on $\\theta$, not $\\theta/2$).\n    C) $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2))$ - This matches our derived result.\n    D) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2))$ - Incorrect dimensions and constants.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
