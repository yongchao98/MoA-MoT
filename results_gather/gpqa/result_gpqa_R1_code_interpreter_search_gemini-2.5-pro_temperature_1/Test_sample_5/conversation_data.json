    "Here's a step-by-step derivation to find the energy spectrum.\n\n**1. Understand the Potential**\n\nThe potential energy of the particle is given in polar coordinates (r, θ):\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)\n\nTo solve the Schrödinger equation, it's often easier to work in Cartesian coordinates (x, y), especially if the potential becomes separable.\n\n**2. Convert the Potential to Cartesian Coordinates**\n\nWe use the standard transformation relations:\n*   x = r cos(θ)\n*   y = r sin(θ)\n*   r^2 = x^2 + y^2\n\nFrom these, we can express the terms in the potential as functions of x and y:\n*   The first term is `1/2 kr^2 = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2)`.\n*   For the second term, we first note that `x^2 = r^2 cos^2(θ)`. So, `3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ) = 3/2 kx^2`.\n\nNow, substitute these back into the potential expression:\nV(x, y) = [1/2 k(x^2 + y^2)] + [3/2 kx^2]\nV(x, y) = 1/2 kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2 + 3/2 kx^2\n\nCombine the terms with x^2:\nV(x, y) = (1/2 + 3/2)kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\nV(x, y) = (4/2)kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\nV(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\n\n**3. Analyze the Separated Potential**\n\nThe potential has now separated into two independent parts, one depending only on x and the other only on y:\nV(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)\nwhere:\n*   V_x(x) = 2kx^2\n*   V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2\n\nThis is the potential of a 2D anisotropic quantum harmonic oscillator. The total energy E will be the sum of the energies from the x-motion and the y-motion (E = E_x + E_y).\n\n**4. Find the Frequencies for Each Dimension**\n\nThe standard potential for a 1D quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO) is V(z) = 1/2 mω^2 z^2, and its energy spectrum is E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω. We need to find the effective angular frequencies ω_x and ω_y for our system.\n\n*   **For the x-direction:**\n    V_x(x) = 2kx^2 = 1/2 mω_x^2 x^2\n    Comparing coefficients:\n    mω_x^2 = 4k\n    ω_x^2 = 4k/m\n    ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 * sqrt(k/m)\n\n*   **For the y-direction:**\n    V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2 = 1/2 mω_y^2 y^2\n    Comparing coefficients:\n    mω_y^2 = k\n    ω_y^2 = k/m\n    ω_y = sqrt(k/m)\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Energy Spectrum**\n\nThe energy for each independent oscillator is given by the standard QHO formula:\n*   E_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * [2 * sqrt(k/m)]\n*   E_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħ * [sqrt(k/m)]\nwhere n_x and n_y are the quantum numbers (0, 1, 2, ...).\n\nThe total energy E is the sum E_x + E_y:\nE = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * 2 * sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\nFactor out the common term ħ*sqrt(k/m):\nE = [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = [2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2] * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n**6. Compare with the Given Options**\n\nThe calculated energy spectrum is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m). This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
