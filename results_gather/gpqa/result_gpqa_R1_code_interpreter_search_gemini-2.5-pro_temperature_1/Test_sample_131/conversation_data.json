    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**1. Analyze the Provided 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's break down the information given about the 1H NMR spectrum of the 1:1 mixture:\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are isomers with the formula C10H14. All four options fit this formula.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals, both of which are singlets. Their integration ratio is 1:1.\n    *   A **singlet** in the aromatic region means the proton(s) responsible for that signal have no adjacent protons to couple with.\n    *   A 1:1 integration ratio in a 1:1 molar mixture implies that the total number of aromatic protons in the first compound is equal to the total number of aromatic protons in the second compound.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all of which are singlets. Their integration ratio is 2:1:1.\n    *   The fact that these are all **singlets** is a crucial piece of information. An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) would produce a quartet and a triplet due to spin-spin coupling, not singlets. This immediately tells us the alkyl groups are likely methyl groups (-CH3).\n\n**2. Evaluate Each Candidate Compound**\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring with two ethyl groups at opposite positions (para).\n    *   **Symmetry:** High. All four aromatic protons are chemically equivalent. The two ethyl groups are equivalent.\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:**\n        *   Aromatic: One singlet (for 4H).\n        *   Alkyl: One quartet (for the 4H of the two -CH2- groups) and one triplet (for the 6H of the two -CH3 groups).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is inconsistent with the data because its alkyl signals are a quartet and a triplet, not singlets. It also has 4 aromatic protons, whereas the tetramethylbenzenes have 2. This would lead to a 2:1 aromatic signal ratio in a mixture, not 1:1. **1,4-diethylbenzene is eliminated.** This rules out option A.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring with four adjacent methyl groups.\n    *   **Symmetry:** It has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:**\n        *   Aromatic: There are two protons at C5 and C6. They are chemically equivalent due to symmetry, but they are adjacent to each other. Therefore, they will couple and appear as an AB quartet (or two doublets if the chemical shift difference is large enough). They will **not** be singlets.\n        *   Alkyl: Two singlets of 6H each (C1/C4 methyls are equivalent, and C2/C3 methyls are equivalent).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is inconsistent with the data because its aromatic signal would not be a singlet. **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is eliminated.** This rules out options B and D.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring with methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n    *   **Symmetry:** High. It has two planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:**\n        *   Aromatic: Two protons at C3 and C6. They are equivalent and have no adjacent protons. This will give **one singlet (2H)**.\n        *   Alkyl: The four methyl groups are all equivalent. This will give **one singlet (12H)**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is a possible candidate.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring with methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 3, and 5.\n    *   **Symmetry:** Low. There are no planes of symmetry or rotational axes.\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:**\n        *   Aromatic: Two protons at C4 and C6. They are in different chemical environments and have no adjacent protons. This will give **two singlets (1H each)**.\n        *   Alkyl: The four methyl groups are all in different chemical environments. This should theoretically give four singlets. However, due to accidental equivalence (isochrony), where different protons have very similar chemical shifts, the spectrum is simpler. It typically shows **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H (which is 2:1:1), as two of the methyl groups happen to resonate at the same frequency.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is a possible candidate.\n\n**3. Analyze the Mixture of the Remaining Candidates**\n\nThe only remaining possibility is a mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**. Let's see if a 1:1 mixture of these two fits the data.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   Durene provides one singlet integrating to 2H.\n    *   Isodurene provides two singlets, each integrating to 1H.\n    *   The problem states we observe **two singlets** with a **1:1 ratio**. This can happen if the two 1H singlets from Isodurene are accidentally equivalent under the experimental conditions, appearing as a single singlet that integrates to 2H.\n    *   So, we would have: Signal 1 (from Durene, 2H) and Signal 2 (from Isodurene, 2H). This gives two singlets in a 1:1 ratio, which matches the data perfectly.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region:**\n    *   Durene provides one singlet integrating to 12H.\n    *   Isodurene provides three singlets integrating to 6H, 3H, and 3H.\n    *   The problem states we observe **three singlets** with a **2:1:1 ratio**.\n    *   Let's analyze the total protons and ratios. The total number of methyl protons in the 1:1 mixture is 12H (from Durene) + 12H (from Isodurene) = 24H. A 2:1:1 ratio means the total is split into 4 parts (2+1+1). So each part is 24H / 4 = 6H. The signals must therefore integrate to 12H (2 parts), 6H (1 part), and 6H (1 part).\n    *   Let's see if we can form this from our components:\n        *   The **12H signal** comes directly from Durene.\n        *   The first **6H signal** comes from the 6H signal of Isodurene.\n        *   The second **6H signal** can be formed if the two 3H signals from Isodurene are accidentally equivalent and overlap, appearing as a single signal.\n    *   This combination (12H, 6H, 6H) gives an integration ratio of 2:1:1 and results in three singlets. This also matches the data perfectly.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed 1:1, can produce the described 1H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
