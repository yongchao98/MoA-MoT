    "*   **Initial State Analysis**\n    The problem describes the annihilation of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). The antiproton is said to be \"slowly moving\". In the context of particle physics, this typically means its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. A standard simplifying assumption for such problems is to consider the annihilation to occur \"at rest,\" meaning the initial total momentum is zero and the initial kinetic energy is zero. Therefore, the total initial energy ($E_i$) is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n\n*   **Final State Analysis**\n    The annihilation produces four particles in the final state: two $A^{+}$ and two $A^{-}$. Since $A^{+}$ and $A^{-}$ are antiparticles of each other, they must have the same mass, $m_A$. The problem states the rest energy of particle A is $m_A c^2 = 300$ MeV. The final total energy ($E_f$) is the sum of the total energies of these four particles.\n\n*   **Applying Conservation Laws**\n    1.  **Conservation of Momentum:** Since we assume the initial system is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero ($P_i = 0$). By the law of conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero ($P_f = 0$). This implies that the four A particles must fly apart in such a way that their vector momenta cancel out.\n    2.  **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the annihilation must equal the total energy after.\n        $E_i = E_f$\n\n*   **Calculations**\n    1.  **Calculate Initial Energy ($E_i$):**\n        The rest energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) is approximately 938.27 MeV. The antiproton has the same rest energy.\n        $E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2 = 2 \\times 938.27 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.54 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n    2.  **Calculate Energy of a Single Final Particle ($E_A$):**\n        The total initial energy is converted into the energy of the four A particles. Due to the symmetry of the final state (four identical mass particles) and the zero total momentum, the energy is distributed equally among them.\n        $E_f = 4 \\times E_A$\n        $E_i = E_f \\implies 1876.54 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\times E_A$\n        $E_A = \\frac{1876.54 \\text{ MeV}}{4} = 469.135 \\text{ MeV}$\n        This is the total energy (rest energy + kinetic energy) of a single particle A.\n\n    3.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):**\n        The total energy of a relativistic particle is given by the equation $E = \\gamma m c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n        For particle A, we have:\n        $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$\n        We know $E_A = 469.135$ MeV and the rest energy $m_A c^2 = 300$ MeV.\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469.135 \\text{ MeV}}{300 \\text{ MeV}} \\approx 1.5638$\n\n    4.  **Calculate the Velocity (v):**\n        The Lorentz factor is related to velocity by the formula $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$. We need to solve for $v$.\n        $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n        $1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n        Substituting the value of $\\gamma$:\n        $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n        $v/c \\approx 0.7688$\n\n    The velocity of particle A is approximately 0.77 times the speed of light. Comparing this to the given options:\n    A) 0.96c\n    B) 0.91c\n    C) 0.77c\n    D) 0.86c\n\n    The calculated value matches option C.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, we can use a Python script for the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\n# Rest energy of a proton in MeV\nm_p_c2 = 938.27208816\n# Rest energy of particle A in MeV\nm_A_c2 = 300.0\n\n# 1.

Deconstruct the problem:**\n*   **Process:** Proton-antiproton annihilation ($p + \\bar{p} \\rightarrow 2A^{+} + 2A^{-}$).\n*   **Initial condition:** Antiproton is \"slowly moving\". This is a key phrase in physics problems, usually meaning we can assume its kinetic energy is negligible. This simplifies the initial state to a system at rest.\n*   **Final state:** Four particles (two $A^+$ and two $A^-$). They are antiparticles of each other, so they have the same mass.\n*   **Given value:** Rest energy of particle A, $m_A c^2 = 300$ MeV.\n*   **Question:** What is the velocity ($v$) of particle A? The answers are given as a fraction of the speed of light, c.\n\n**2. Formulate a plan:**\n*   Apply the principle of conservation of energy.\n*   The total energy before the collision must equal the total energy after the collision.\n*   **Step 1: Calculate the initial total energy ($E_i$).**\n    *   Since the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" we assume the system is at rest. The initial kinetic energy is zero.\n    *   The total initial energy is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n    *   I need the rest energy of a proton. I can search for it or use a known value. It's approximately 938 MeV. The antiproton has the same mass/rest energy.\n    *   $E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2$.\n*   **Step 2: Calculate the total energy of a single final particle ($E_A$).**\n    *   The final state consists of four particles of the same mass ($m_A$).\n    *   The total final energy is $E_f = E_{A1} + E_{A2} + E_{A3} + E_{A4}$.\n    *   By conservation of momentum, since the initial momentum is zero, the final total momentum must also be zero. The four particles must fly out symmetrically.\n    *   Due to this symmetry, the energy will be distributed equally among the four final particles.\n    *   So, $E_f = 4 \\times E_A$.\n    *   From energy conservation, $E_i = E_f$, so $2 \\times m_p c^2 = 4 \\times E_A$.\n    *   Therefore, $E_A = \\frac{2 \\times m_p c^2}{4} = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2}$.\n*   **Step 3: Relate the total energy of particle A to its velocity.**\n    *   The total energy of a relativistic particle is given by $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$.\n    *   I can calculate $\\gamma$ using the values I have: $\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2}$.\n*   **Step 4: Solve for the velocity, v.**\n    *   Once I have $\\gamma$, I can rearrange the formula to solve for $v/c$.\n    *   $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n    *   $1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    *   $(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    *   $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n*   **Step 5: Compare the result with the given options.**\n\n**3.

Let's use a more precise value, $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.27$ MeV.\n    *   $E_i = 2 \\times 938.27 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.54 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   **Step 2:**\n    *   $E_A = \\frac{E_i}{4} = \\frac{1876.54 \\text{ MeV}}{4} = 469.135 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   **Step 3:**\n    *   We are given $m_A c^2 = 300$ MeV.\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469.135 \\text{ MeV}}{300 \\text{ MeV}} \\approx 1.56378$.\n*   **Step 4:**\n    *   $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.56378)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911}$.\n    *   $v/c \\approx 0.7688$.\n*   **Step 5:**\n    *   The calculated value is $v \\approx 0.77c$.\n    *   This matches option C.\n\nThe reasoning seems sound. The python code I generated in the first step confirms these calculations. It used a precise value for the proton's rest mass energy and performed the steps correctly. The output `Velocity of particle A (v/c): 0.7688` directly supports option C.\n\nFinal check of the logic:\n- Assumption of annihilation at rest is standard for \"slowly moving\" antiproton.\n- Conservation of energy is a fundamental principle.\n- Conservation of momentum leads to symmetric energy distribution.\n- Relativistic energy-momentum relations are correctly applied.\n- The arithmetic is correct, as verified by the python script.\n\nThe process and conclusion are robust. I am ready to provide the final answer. The process described is the annihilation of a proton and an antiproton, which are at rest, into four new particles (two $A^{+}$ and two $A^{-}$). To find the velocity of particle A, we must apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Initial State Energy ($E_i$):**\n    The problem states that the antiproton is \"slowly moving.\" In particle physics, this is a common simplification meaning we can assume the initial system is effectively at rest. Therefore, the initial kinetic energy is negligible, and the total initial energy is the sum of the rest energies of the proton ($p$) and the antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    The rest energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.27$ MeV. An antiproton has the exact same mass.\n    $E_i = E_{rest, p} + E_{rest, \\bar{p}} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2$\n    $E_i = 2 \\times 938.27 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.54 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n2.  **Final State Energy ($E_f$):**\n    The final state consists of four particles: two $A^{+}$ and two $A^{-}$. Since $A^{+}$ and $A^{-}$ are a particle-antiparticle pair, they have the same mass, $m_A$. The problem gives the rest energy as $m_A c^2 = 300$ MeV.\n    The total final energy is the sum of the total energies of these four particles.\n    $E_f = E_{A_1} + E_{A_2} + E_{A_3} + E_{A_4}$\n\n3.  **Conservation of Momentum and Energy Distribution:**\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial system is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero ($P_i = 0$). By conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero ($P_f = 0$). This means the four final particles must fly off in directions such that their vector momenta sum to zero.\n    *   **Energy Distribution:** Due to the symmetry of the final state (four particles of identical mass) and the requirement of zero total momentum, the total energy released from the annihilation will be distributed equally among the four particles.\n    *   Therefore, the total energy of each particle A ($E_A$) is one-fourth of the total initial energy.\n\n4.  **Energy of a Single Particle A:**\n    From the conservation of energy, $E_i = E_f$.\n    $1876.54 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\times E_A$\n    $E_A = \\frac{1876.54 \\text{ MeV}}{4} = 469.135 \\text{ MeV}$\n    This value, $E_A$, represents the total energy (rest energy + kinetic energy) of a single particle A.\n\n5.  **Calculating Velocity from Energy:**\n    The total energy of a relativistic particle is given by the formula $E = \\gamma m c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, defined as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$.\n    *   We can first find the Lorentz factor for particle A:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469.135 \\text{ MeV}}{300 \\text{ MeV}} \\approx 1.5638$\n    *   Now, we solve for the velocity, $v$.\n        $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n        $1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n        $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n        $v/c \\approx 0.7688$\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The velocity of particle A is approximately 0.77 times the speed of light ($0.77c$). This matches option C. The provided code output confirms this calculation precisely.\n\n<<<C>>>"
