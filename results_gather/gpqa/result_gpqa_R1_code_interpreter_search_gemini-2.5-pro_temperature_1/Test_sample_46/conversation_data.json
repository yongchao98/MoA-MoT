    "This is a step-by-step analysis to identify the compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\nThe formula for DoU is: C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\n*   C = 9 (carbon atoms)\n*   H = 11 (hydrogen atoms)\n*   N = 1 (nitrogen atom)\n*   O = 2 (oxygen atoms, which don't affect the calculation)\n*   X = 0 (halogen atoms)\n\nDoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\nA DoU of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees: 3 for double bonds and 1 for the ring) and one additional double bond (e.g., C=O or C=C).\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum:**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two medium-to-strong bands in this region is a classic indicator of a primary amine (-NH₂). One band is for the asymmetric N-H stretch, and the other is for the symmetric N-H stretch. This information immediately rules out option D, which is a secondary amide and would only show one N-H stretch.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl (C=O) region. This frequency is typical for an ester, particularly one that is conjugated with a double bond or an aromatic ring. Combined with the DoU calculation, this strongly suggests a structure with a benzene ring and a C=O group.\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The significant difference in chemical shift (7.0 vs. 8.0 ppm) indicates that one substituent is strongly electron-donating (shifting its ortho protons upfield to ~7.0 ppm) and the other is strongly electron-withdrawing (shifting its ortho protons downfield to ~8.0 ppm). The amino group (-NH₂) is a strong electron-donating group, and the ester group (-COOR) is a strong electron-withdrawing group.\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination of a triplet (3H) and a quartet (2H) is the signature pattern of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm is very downfield, which indicates that the -CH₂- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom in an ester (-O-CH₂CH₃). If it were an ethoxy group attached directly to the ring (-O-CH₂CH₃), the shift would be closer to 4.0 ppm. If it were part of a propionyl group (-CO-CH₂CH₃), the shift would be around 2.5-3.0 ppm.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is consistent with the two protons of the primary amine (-NH₂) identified from the IR spectrum. The broadness is due to quadrupolar relaxation and/or chemical exchange. Its position is consistent with an amino group attached to an aromatic ring.\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure and Evaluate the Options:**\nBased on the analysis, the molecule contains:\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   A primary amine group (-NH₂).\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nLet's combine these pieces. The two substituents on the benzene ring must be the -NH₂ group and the -COOCH₂CH₃ group. This gives the structure for **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this against the options:\n*   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This has an NH₂ and a para-substituted ring, but the ester linkage is different (Ar-O-CO-Et). The NMR for the ethyl group would be different (quartet at ~2.5 ppm).\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a meta-substituted compound, which contradicts the NMR aromatic pattern.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure (H₂N-Ar-CO-O-Et) perfectly matches all the data. The para-substituted ring with an electron-donating group (NH₂) and an electron-withdrawing group (COOEt) explains the two doublets. The ethyl ester fragment explains the triplet and the highly deshielded quartet. The primary amine explains the two IR bands and the broad NMR singlet.\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which is inconsistent with the IR data (which shows a primary amine).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe spectral data unequivocally points to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate as the correct structure.\n\n<<<C>>>"
