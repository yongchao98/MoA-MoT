    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical reaction:** The problem involves the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex. The complex, which we can denote as [CaY]²⁻, dissociates into calcium ions (Ca²⁺) and the EDTA anion (Y⁴⁻). The equilibrium reaction is:\n    [CaY]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n\n2.  **Understand the equilibrium constant:** The given constant, K_Ca-EDTA = 5 x 10¹⁰, is the **formation constant** (Kf). This constant corresponds to the formation of the complex from its ions:\n    Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ [CaY]²⁻\n    Kf = [[CaY]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\n    Since we are looking at the dissociation of the complex, we need the **dissociation constant** (Kd), which is the inverse of the formation constant:\n    Kd = 1 / Kf = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table:** We can track the concentrations of the species as the system reaches equilibrium. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ that forms from the dissociation of the complex.\n\n    | Species     | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n    |-------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n    | [CaY]²⁻     | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n    | Ca²⁺        | 0           | +x         | x               |\n    | Y⁴⁻         | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n4.  **Write the equilibrium expression and solve for x:** Now, we use the dissociation constant (Kd) expression with the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table:\n    Kd = ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) / [[CaY]²⁻]\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x * x) / (0.02 - x)\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ = x² / (0.02 - x)\n\n5.  **Apply an approximation:** Because the formation constant (Kf) is very large, the dissociation constant (Kd) is very small. This means the equilibrium strongly favors the complex, and very little of it will dissociate. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be much smaller than the initial concentration of the complex (x << 0.02). We can simplify the denominator:\n    0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\n    The equation becomes:\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\n6.  **Calculate the value of x:**\n    x² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * 0.02\n    x² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n    x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\n    x = √(40 x 10⁻¹⁴)\n    x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n    The concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is equal to x.\n    [Ca²⁺] ≈ 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\ninitial_complex_conc = 0.02  # M\nKf = 5e10  # Formation constant\n\n# The dissociation reaction is [CaY]2- <=> Ca2+ + Y4-\n# The equilibrium constant for dissociation (Kd) is 1/Kf.\n# Kd = [Ca2+][Y4-] / [[CaY]2-]\n# Let x = [Ca2+] = [Y4-] at equilibrium.\n# Then [[CaY]2-] = initial_complex_conc - x\n# The equation is Kd = x**2 / (initial_complex_conc - x)\n# Since Kf is very large, Kd is very small, so x << initial_complex_conc.\n# We can approximate initial_complex_conc - x as initial_complex_conc.\n# So, Kd = x**2 / initial_complex_conc\n# x**2 = Kd * initial_complex_conc\n# x = sqrt(Kd * initial_complex_conc)\n# x = sqrt((1/Kf) * initial_complex_conc)\n\nx_squared = (1 / Kf) * initial_complex_conc\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\nprint(f\"{x:.2e}\")\n```\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem asks for the concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], in a solution initially containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n1.  **Define the chemical equilibrium:** The Ca-EDTA complex, which we can denote as [CaY]²⁻ (where Y⁴⁻ is the fully deprotonated EDTA anion), is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, Ca²⁺ and Y⁴⁻. The dissociation reaction is:\n    [CaY]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n\n2.  **Determine the correct equilibrium constant:** The problem provides the formation constant (Kf) for the complex, K_Ca-EDTA = 5 x 10¹⁰.
