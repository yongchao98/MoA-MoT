You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected.

    "During your experiment to overexpress a tagged GADD45G protein, you encounter a failure to produce the desired full-length protein. The key to understanding this issue lies in the sequence of your DNA construct.\n\nLet's analyze the provided DNA sequence step-by-step, focusing on how it would be translated into a protein by the ribosome.\n\n1.  **Identify the Start Codon:** Translation in eukaryotes almost always begins at the first `ATG` codon. The sequence starts with `5'-ATG...`, which correctly codes for the initial Methionine (M).\n\n2.  **Translate the N-terminal Tag:** The problem states you added an influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag to the N-terminus. The peptide sequence for the HA tag is `YPYDVPDYA`. Let's translate the DNA sequence immediately following the start codon:\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   `CCA` -> Proline (P)\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   `GAT` -> Aspartic Acid (D)\n    *   `GTT` -> Valine (V)\n    *   `CCA` -> Proline (P)\n    *   `GAT` -> Aspartic Acid (D)\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   `GCC` -> Alanine (A)\n    The translated sequence is `MYPYDVPDYA`. This corresponds to the start Methionine followed by the correct HA tag sequence. So far, so good.\n\n3.  **Continue Translation into the Gene Sequence:** The ribosome continues reading the mRNA in three-base codons (a process called maintaining the reading frame). The sequence immediately following the HA tag portion is `AAATGA...`.\n    *   The next codon is `AAA`, which codes for the amino acid Lysine (K).\n    *   The codon immediately after that is `TGA`.\n\n4.  **Encountering a Stop Codon:** In the universal genetic code, `TGA` is one of the three stop codons (along with `TAA` and `TAG`). When the ribosome encounters a stop codon in the correct reading frame, it does not add an amino acid. Instead, protein release factors bind to the ribosome, causing the newly synthesized peptide chain to be released and the ribosome to dissociate from the mRNA. This terminates translation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBecause of the `TGA` stop codon located immediately after the sequence for the HA tag and a single Lysine, the ribosome stops translation prematurely. Instead of producing the full-length HA-tagged GADD45G protein, the cell only produces a very short, 12-amino-acid-long peptide (`MYPYDVPDYAK`). This directly explains why you are unable to detect the overexpression of your target protein.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on this finding:\n*   A) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain: While linkers can be important for protein folding, the primary issue here is that the full protein is never even made.\n*   B) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation: Our analysis shows the HA tag sequence is encoded correctly.\n*   C) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse: This is incorrect. The problem occurs in CHO cells, the codon is `TGA`, and stop codons are recognized by release factors, not tRNAs.\n*   D) The ribosome terminated the translation early: This is precisely what happens. The premature `TGA` stop codon halts protein synthesis, preventing the formation of the full-length protein.\n\nTherefore, the annoying reason for the failure of your experiment is the early termination of translation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
