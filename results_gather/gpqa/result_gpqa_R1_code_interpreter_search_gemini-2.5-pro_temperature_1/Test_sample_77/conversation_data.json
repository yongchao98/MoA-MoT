    "This problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. These potentials are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### 1. Conceptual Framework\nThe electromagnetic fields (and potentials) at a point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$ are not determined by the state of the source charge at time $t$, but by its state at an earlier time, called the **retarded time** ($t_r$). This is because electromagnetic disturbances propagate at a finite speed, the speed of light $c$.\n\nThe retarded time $t_r$ is defined by the condition that the time it takes for light to travel from the source's position at $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$ is exactly $t - t_r$.\nLet the trajectory of the charge $q$ be $\\vec{s}(t)$. The position of the charge at the retarded time is $\\vec{s}(t_r)$.\nThe vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point is $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$.\nThe distance is $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$.\nThe retardation condition is therefore:\n$t - t_r = \\frac{d}{c}$\n\nThe velocity of the charge at the retarded time is $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt} \\bigg|_{t=t_r}$.\n\n### 2. Derivation of the Potentials (Liénard-Wiechert Potentials)\n\nThe general expressions for the potentials in terms of charge density $\\rho$ and current density $\\vec{J}$ are given by the retarded potential formulas:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d\\tau'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r')}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d\\tau'$\nwhere $t_r' = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c$ and $d\\tau'$ is the volume element at the source point $\\vec{r}'$.\n\nFor a point charge $q$ moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, the charge and current densities can be expressed using Dirac delta functions:\n$\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\, \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n$\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\, \\vec{v}(t') \\, \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\nSubstituting these into the potential integrals is non-trivial because the retarded time $t_r'$ inside the delta function depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$. A careful evaluation of the integral, which accounts for the \"compression\" of the apparent volume of the source due to its motion (a relativistic Doppler-like effect), yields the following results.\n\n### 3. Scalar Potential (V)\nThe integral for the scalar potential evaluates to:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\hat{d}}{c})} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\nwhere $\\hat{d} = \\vec{d}/d$, and the subscript \"ret\" indicates that all quantities inside the bracket ($\\vec{d}$, $d$, and $\\vec{v}$) are to be evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\nLet's simplify the denominator:\n$d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\hat{d}}{c}) = d - \\frac{d(\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}/d)}{c} = d - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{c}$\nSo, the potential can be written as:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} / c}$\nTo match the form in the options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{c}{c} \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} / c} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n### 4. Vector Potential ($\\vec{A}$)\nSimilarly, the integral for the vector potential evaluates to:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\hat{d}}{c})} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\nUsing the same denominator simplification as before:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} / c}$\nAgain, multiplying the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n### 5. Comparing with Options\nLet's compare our derived expressions with the given options.\n\n*   **A) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$**: Incorrect. This uses the static Coulomb potential form, which is not valid for a moving charge (unless $v=0$). The expression for $\\vec{A}$ is also dimensionally and conceptually incorrect.\n*   **B) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$**: This exactly matches our derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n*   **C) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$**: Incorrect. The sign in the denominator is wrong. A plus sign would correspond to advanced potentials, which are generally considered unphysical.\n*   **D) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$**: Incorrect. Again, this uses the static form for $V$. While the relation $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2}V$ is actually correct for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials (as shown by comparing the expressions in option B), the expression for $V$ itself is wrong, making the entire option incorrect as an answer to the question.\n\nTherefore, option B provides the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.\n\n<<<B>>>"
