    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the fundamental quantities:**\n    *   **Stellar Density (ρ):** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed. This means the number of stars per unit volume, ρ, is constant everywhere in space.\n    *   **Parallax (plx):** Parallax is an angular measurement that is inversely proportional to the distance (d) of a star. The relationship is given by:\n        `plx = 1/d`\n        This implies that the distance `d` can be expressed as:\n        `d = 1/plx`\n        (Assuming `d` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds).\n\n2.  **Relate the number of stars to distance:**\n    *   Consider a sphere of radius `d` centered on the observer. The volume of this sphere is `V = (4/3)πd³`.\n    *   The total number of stars (`N`) within this sphere is the product of the constant stellar density (ρ) and the volume (V):\n        `N(d) = ρ * V = ρ * (4/3)πd³`\n\n3.  **Find the number of stars in a thin shell:**\n    *   We are interested in the number of stars *per unit range* of some variable (in this case, parallax). This suggests we should look at how the number of stars changes in a small interval. Let's consider a thin spherical shell at a distance `d` with a small thickness `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this thin shell (`dV`) can be found by differentiating the volume `V` with respect to the radius `d`:\n        `dV/dd = d/dd [(4/3)πd³] = 4πd²`\n        So, the volume of the infinitesimally thin shell is `dV = 4πd² dd`.\n    *   The number of stars (`dN`) within this thin shell is the density multiplied by the shell's volume:\n        `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² dd`\n\n4.  **Convert the relationship from distance (`d`) to parallax (`plx`):**\n    *   The goal is to find how the number of stars changes with parallax (`dN/d(plx)`), not distance (`dN/dd`). So, we need to substitute `d` and `dd` with their parallax equivalents.\n    *   We already have `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   To find the relationship between `dd` and `d(plx)`, we differentiate `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = -1/plx²`\n        Therefore, `dd = -(1/plx²) d(plx)`.\n    *   The negative sign indicates that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. Since we are counting a number of stars (a positive quantity) within a range `d(plx)`, we can use the magnitude of the relationship: `|dd| = (1/plx²) d(plx)`.\n\n5.  **Substitute and solve:**\n    *   Now, substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` into the equation for `dN`:\n        `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) d(plx)`\n    *   Combine the terms:\n        `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Find the final relationship:**\n    *   The question asks for \"the number of stars per unit range of parallax,\" which is the quantity `dN/d(plx)`.\n    *   From the equation above, we can divide both sides by `d(plx)`:\n        `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n    *   Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, we can see the proportionality:\n        `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the inverse fourth power of the parallax. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
