    "The user wants to calculate the total energy of a specific nucleus accelerated to a relativistic speed.\n\n**1. Identify the Nucleus (X)**\n*   The element is Lithium (Li), which has an atomic number (Z) of 3, meaning it has 3 protons.\n*   The problem states it has 3 neutrons (N).\n*   The mass number (A) is the sum of protons and neutrons: A = Z + N = 3 + 3 = 6.\n*   Therefore, the nucleus is Lithium-6 ($^{6}$Li).\n\n**2. Determine the Rest Mass ($m_0$) and Rest Energy ($E_0$) of the Nucleus**\nTo find the energy, we first need the rest mass of the $^{6}$Li nucleus. The most accurate way is to use its known mass in atomic mass units (amu) and convert it to energy units (GeV).\n\n*   The atomic mass of a neutral $^{6}$Li atom is approximately 6.015122795 amu.\n*   The mass of a nucleus is the atomic mass minus the mass of its electrons. For $^{6}$Li, we subtract the mass of 3 electrons.\n    *   Mass of an electron ≈ 0.00054858 amu.\n    *   Mass of 3 electrons = 3 * 0.00054858 = 0.00164574 amu.\n*   Mass of $^{6}$Li nucleus = 6.015122795 amu - 0.00164574 amu = 6.013477055 amu.\n*   We convert this mass to energy using the conversion factor: 1 amu ≈ 931.4941 MeV/c².\n*   Rest energy ($E_0$) = 6.013477055 amu * 931.4941 MeV/amu = 5601.520 MeV.\n*   Converting MeV to GeV: $E_0$ = 5.60152 GeV.\n\n**3. Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**\nThe Lorentz factor is required for relativistic energy calculations and depends on the velocity (v).\n*   The given velocity is v = 0.96c.\n*   The formula for the Lorentz factor is: $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n*   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.0784}} = \\frac{1}{0.28}$\n*   $\\gamma = 3.571428...$\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Relativistic Energy (E)**\nThe total energy of a particle moving at relativistic speed is its rest energy multiplied by the Lorentz factor.\n*   The formula is: E = $\\gamma E_0$\n*   E = 3.571428 * 5.60152 GeV\n*   E ≈ 20.0054 GeV\n\nLet's perform the calculation with a script to ensure precision.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nmass_Li6_atom_amu = 6.015122795\nmass_electron_amu = 0.00054858\namu_to_MeV = 931.4941\nMeV_to_GeV = 1e-3\nv_over_c = 0.96 # v = 0.96c\n\n# 1. Calculate the mass of the Li-6 nucleus\nmass_Li6_nucleus_amu = mass_Li6_atom_amu - (3 * mass_electron_amu)\n\n# 2. Calculate the rest energy in GeV\nrest_energy_MeV = mass_Li6_nucleus_amu * amu_to_MeV\nrest_energy_GeV = rest_energy_MeV * MeV_to_GeV\n\n# 3. Calculate the Lorentz factor\nlorentz_gamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v_over_c**2)\n\n# 4. Calculate the total relativistic energy\ntotal_energy_GeV = lorentz_gamma * rest_energy_GeV\n\nprint(f\"{total_energy_GeV:.4f}\")\n```\n20.0054\n\nThe calculated total energy is approximately 20.0054 GeV. Comparing this result with the given options:\nA) 23.069 GeV\nB) 18.475 GeV\nC) 21.419 GeV\nD) 20.132 GeV\n\nThe value 20.0054 GeV is closest to 20.132 GeV. The minor discrepancy (about 0.6%) likely arises from slightly different values for the physical constants (mass of $^{6}$Li, amu-to-MeV conversion factor) used in the problem's reference material compared to the modern standard values used here. However, it is by far the most plausible answer.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Nucleus and its Composition**\n*   The problem specifies the element is Lithium (Li). The atomic number of Lithium is Z=3, which means it has 3 protons.\n*   It is stated to have 3 neutrons (N=3).\n*   The mass number (A) is the sum of protons and neutrons: A = Z + N = 3 + 3 = 6.\n*   Therefore, the nucleus in question is Lithium-6, denoted as $^{6}$Li.\n\n**2. Determine the Rest Energy of the Nucleus ($E_0$)**\nFor this type of problem, there are two common ways to determine the rest mass/energy:\na) Use the precise mass of the bound nucleus.\nb) Approximate the mass by summing the masses of its constituent protons and neutrons (ignoring binding energy).\n\nLet's try method (b), as it is a common simplification in physics problems and often aligns with textbook question methodologies.\n\n*   **Rest Mass of a Proton ($m_p$):** Approximately 938.272 MeV/c².\n*   **Rest Mass of a Neutron ($m_n$):** Approximately 939.565 MeV/c².\n*   **Rest Energy of $^{6}$Li nucleus ($E_0$):** This is the sum of the rest energies of its 3 protons and 3 neutrons.\n    $E_0 = (3 \\times m_p c^2) + (3 \\times m_n c^2)$\n    $E_0 = (3 \\times 938.272 \\text{ MeV}) + (3 \\times 939.565 \\text{ MeV})$\n    $E_0 = 2814.816 \\text{ MeV} + 2818.695 \\text{ MeV}$\n    $E_0 = 5633.511 \\text{ MeV}$\n*   Convert the rest energy to Giga-electron Volts (GeV):\n    $E_0 = 5633.511 \\text{ MeV} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ GeV}}{1000 \\text{ MeV}} = 5.6335 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n**3. Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**\nThe Lorentz factor is a function of the object's speed (v) relative to the speed of light (c).\n*   Given speed: v = 0.96c\n*   The formula for the Lorentz factor is: $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n*   Substitute the given speed:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.96c/c)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.96^2}}$\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.0784}}$\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{0.28} \\approx 3.5714$\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Relativistic Energy (E)**\nThe total energy of an object moving at relativistic speed is its rest energy multiplied by the Lorentz factor.\n*   The formula is: $E = \\gamma E_0$\n*   Substitute the values calculated in the previous steps:\n    $E = 3.5714 \\times 5.6335 \\text{ GeV}$\n    $E \\approx 20.1196 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n**5. Compare with the Options**\nThe calculated energy is approximately 20.120 GeV. Let's compare this with the given choices:\nA) 23.069 GeV\nB) 18.475 GeV\nC) 21.419\nD) 20.132 GeV\n\nOur calculated value of 20.120 GeV is extremely close to option D, 20.132 GeV. The minor difference (less than 0.1%) can be attributed to the use of slightly different values for the physical constants (mass of proton and neutron) in the source of the question.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
