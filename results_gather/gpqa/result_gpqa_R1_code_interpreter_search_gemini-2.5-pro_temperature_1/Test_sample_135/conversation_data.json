    "*   **1. Identify the Vector Field and the Volume**\n    *   The problem describes a vector field `f(r)` that is directed radially outwards from the origin.\n    *   The magnitude of the field is given by `|f(r)| = 1/r^2`.\n    *   In vector form, using spherical coordinates, the field can be written as `f = (1/r^2) * r_hat`, where `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n    *   The volume of integration `V` is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n*   **2. State the Goal**\n    *   We need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the field `f` over the volume `V`. The integral is `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\n\n*   **3. Choose a Method: The Divergence Theorem**\n    *   The Divergence Theorem is a powerful tool in vector calculus that relates a volume integral of a divergence to a surface integral of the vector field itself. It is particularly useful when the vector field has a singularity, as is the case here at `r = 0`.\n    *   The theorem states: `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`, where `S` is the closed surface that encloses the volume `V`.\n    *   In our case, the volume `V` is a sphere of radius `R`, so the enclosing surface `S` is the surface of that sphere.\n\n*   **4. Set up the Surface Integral**\n    *   **Vector Field on the Surface (S):** On the surface of the sphere, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So, the vector field on the surface is `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`.\n    *   **Differential Surface Area Vector (dS):** For a sphere, the differential surface area element `dS` is always perpendicular to the surface, pointing outwards. This means it is in the radial direction (`r_hat`). Its magnitude is `R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ`.\n    *   Therefore, the vector `dS` is `dS = (R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r_hat`.\n\n*   **5. Calculate the Dot Product (f ⋅ dS)**\n    *   Now we compute the dot product of the field `f` and the surface element `dS`:\n        `f ⋅ dS = [(1/R^2) * r_hat] ⋅ [(R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r_hat]`\n    *   The dot product of the unit vector with itself is `r_hat ⋅ r_hat = 1`.\n    *   The `R^2` terms cancel out:\n        `f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * R^2 * (r_hat ⋅ r_hat) * sin(θ) dθ dφ = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n*   **6. Evaluate the Surface Integral**\n    *   Now we integrate the result over the entire surface of the sphere. In spherical coordinates, this means integrating `θ` from `0` to `π` and `φ` from `0` to `2π`.\n        `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_{φ=0}^{2π} ∫_{θ=0}^{π} sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n    *   **Inner Integral (with respect to θ):**\n        `∫_{0}^{π} sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_{0}^{π} = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n    *   **Outer Integral (with respect to φ):**\n        `∫_{0}^{2π} 2 dφ = 2 * [φ]_{0}^{2π} = 2 * (2π - 0) = 4π`\n\n*   **7. Final Conclusion**\n    *   According to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral we wanted to find is equal to the surface integral we just calculated.\n    *   `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`\n    *   This result is independent of the radius `R` of the sphere (as long as `R > 0` so the origin is included). This is a fundamental result, closely related to Gauss's Law in electrostatics, where the field of a point charge also follows a `1/r^2` law.\n\n*   **Alternative Consideration: Direct Calculation of Divergence**\n    *   If one calculates the divergence of `f = (1/r^2) * r_hat` directly using the formula in spherical coordinates for `r ≠ 0`, the result is `∇ ⋅ f = 0`.\n    *   However, the field is singular at `r = 0`. This singularity is not just a point to be ignored; it contains the entire \"source\" of the field. The divergence at this point is a Dirac delta function: `∇ ⋅ ((1/r^2) * r_hat) = 4πδ³(r)`.\n    *   Integrating this over the volume of the sphere gives `∫_V 4πδ³(r) dV = 4π * 1 = 4π`, which confirms the result from the Divergence Theorem.\n\nComparing the result `4π` with the given options:\nA) 0\nB) 4/3 π R\nC) 4 π\nD) 1\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
