    "Here is a thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** The core of the question is about a specific chemical process: creating branched polyethylene using only ethylene as a starting material. This requires a \"tandem\" or \"dual\" catalyst system.\n    *   **Catalyst 1:** Polymerizes ethylene into a linear polyethylene chain. This is the initial process described, producing a \"polymer of high density\" (HDPE).\n    *   **Catalyst 2:** Takes ethylene and converts it into short alpha-olefins (e.g., 1-butene, 1-hexene, 1-octene). This is an oligomerization reaction.\n    *   **Combined Action:** Catalyst 1 then incorporates these *in situ* generated alpha-olefins as comonomers into the growing polyethylene chains, creating branches. The term \"regular branches\" suggests that the second catalyst is highly selective, producing predominantly one type of alpha-olefin (e.g., only 1-hexene, which would create regular C4 branches).\n\n2.  **Evaluate Each Statement based on Chemical Principles:**\n\n    *   **Statement C: \"One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.\"**\n        *   Group VIa in the old notation corresponds to Group 6 in the modern IUPAC notation. This group contains Chromium (Cr), Molybdenum (Mo), and Tungsten (W).\n        *   The selective oligomerization of ethylene is a well-studied field. The most famous and industrially successful catalysts for the selective trimerization of ethylene to 1-hexene are based on **Chromium (Cr)**.\n        *   These chromium catalysts (e.g., those supported by PNP or SNS pincer ligands) are known for their high selectivity, which would lead to the \"regular branches\" mentioned in the problem.\n        *   Therefore, this statement is chemically accurate and directly addresses the core challenge of the synthesis. This statement is correct.\n\n    *   **Statement B: \"Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.\"**\n        *   The \"essential additional reaction step\" is the ethylene oligomerization performed by the second catalyst (the Group VIa one).\n        *   Organometallic catalysts, including these chromium-based systems, almost always require a co-catalyst or \"activator\" to function. The most common activators are aluminum-based, such as methylaluminoxane (MAO) or various alkylaluminum compounds (e.g., triethylaluminum, TEA).\n        *   In fact, the chromium-based ethylene trimerization catalysts are typically activated by exactly these types of aluminum compounds.\n        *   Therefore, this statement is factually incorrect.\n\n    *   **Statement A: \"Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.\"**\n        *   Noble metals (like palladium, Pd) or late transition metals (like nickel, Ni) are known to catalyze ethylene oligomerization. The most famous example is the Shell Higher Olefin Process (SHOP), which uses a nickel catalyst.\n        *   However, the SHOP process produces a broad distribution of alpha-olefins (a Schulz-Flory distribution), not a single, specific oligomer. This would lead to branches of many different lengths, not the \"regular branches\" the scientist intends to introduce.\n        *   While technically a method for oligomerization, it doesn't fit the \"regular branches\" requirement as well as the selective chromium systems. Furthermore, while Pd is a noble metal and very expensive, Ni is not and is widely used. So the statement is questionable in its specifics and less accurate for the stated goal.\n\n    *   **Statement D: \"Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.\"**\n        *   This refers to single-reactor processes using tandem catalysts to make linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) or bimodal HDPE directly from ethylene.\n        *   Companies like Univation Technologies (a US-based joint venture of Dow and ExxonMobil) and Chevron Phillips Chemical have developed and commercialized such technologies.\n        *   Therefore, this statement is factually correct.\n\n3.  **Compare the Correct Statements (C and D):**\n    *   We have established that both statement C and statement D are correct.\n    *   However, the question is posed from the perspective of a scientist trying to design a system. The statements are advice from a senior scientist.\n    *   Statement C describes the fundamental *chemistry* required: \"Use a Group VIa metal catalyst.\" This is direct, actionable advice on *how* to achieve the desired transformation.\n    *   Statement D describes the *commercial status* of the technology: \"This is already done in industry.\" While true and encouraging, it doesn't explain the chemical principle behind it.\n    *   In the context of solving a chemical problem, the statement describing the correct chemical agent (C) is the more fundamental and direct answer compared to the statement about its industrial implementation (D). Statement C explains *why* the process works, which is the foundation for its industrial implementation.\n\n**Conclusion:** Statement C provides the most accurate and fundamental chemical information that correctly describes how to achieve the desired polymer synthesis.\n\n<<<C>>>"
