    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n### 1. Define Masses and Energies from the Problem Statement\n\n*   **Initial Nucleus:**\n    *   Rest mass: M\n    *   Rest-mass energy: M * c^2 = 300 GeV\n\n*   **Fragments:**\n    *   Rest masses: m1 and m2\n    *   Relationship: m1 = 2 * m2\n    *   Sum of rest masses: m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M\n\n*   **Goal:**\n    *   Find the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (m1), which we call T1.\n    *   Calculate T1 using relativistic mechanics (T1_rel).\n    *   Calculate T1 using classical mechanics (T1_cl).\n    *   Find the difference: |T1_rel - T1_cl|.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Rest Masses of the Fragments\n\nFirst, we determine the rest masses m1 and m2 in terms of M.\nWe have a system of two equations:\n1.  m1 = 2 * m2\n2.  m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M\n\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\n(2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M\n3 * m2 = 0.99 * M\n**m2 = 0.33 * M**\n\nNow find m1:\nm1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M)\n**m1 = 0.66 * M**\n\nNext, we calculate their rest-mass energies:\n*   **m1 * c^2** = 0.66 * (M * c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = **198 GeV**\n*   **m2 * c^2** = 0.33 * (M * c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = **99 GeV**\n\n### 3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)\n\nThe total kinetic energy (Q) released in the fission is due to the \"missing\" mass, according to E=mc^2.\n*   Initial energy = M * c^2 = 300 GeV\n*   Final rest energy = (m1 + m2) * c^2 = 0.99 * M * c^2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV\n*   **Q = T1 + T2** = Initial Energy - Final Rest Energy = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = **3 GeV**\n\n### 4. Relativistic Calculation of T1 (Correct Value)\n\nWe use the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** T1 + T2 = 3 GeV  =>  T2 = 3 - T1\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The initial nucleus is at rest (p_initial = 0), so the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta.\n    *   |p1| = |p2|\n\nWe use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: **E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2**.\nThis can be rewritten in terms of kinetic energy (T = E - m*c^2) as: **(p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2)**.\n\nSince |p1| = |p2|, we have (p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2:\nT1^2 + 2 * T1 * (m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2 * T2 * (m2*c^2)\n\nNow, substitute the known values (T2 = 3 - T1, m1*c^2 = 198 GeV, m2*c^2 = 99 GeV):\nT1^2 + 2 * T1 * (198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2 * (3 - T1) * (99)\nT1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)\n\nThe T1^2 terms on both sides cancel out:\n396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1\n396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1\n396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603\n600*T1 = 603\n**T1_rel = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV**\n\n### 5. Classical Calculation of T1 (Approximation)\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is T = p^2 / (2m).\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** |p1| = |p2| = p_cl\n*   **Kinetic Energies:**\n    *   T1_cl = p_cl^2 / (2*m1)\n    *   T2_cl = p_cl^2 / (2*m2)\n*   **Ratio of Kinetic Energies:**\n    *   T1_cl / T2_cl = (p_cl^2 / 2*m1) / (p_cl^2 / 2*m2) = m2 / m1\n    *   Since m1 = 2*m2, the ratio is m2 / (2*m2) = 1/2.\n    *   So, T2_cl = 2 * T1_cl\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total kinetic energy is still the Q-value.\n    *   T1_cl + T2_cl = 3 GeV\n\nNow we solve the system:\nT1_cl + (2 * T1_cl) = 3 GeV\n3 * T1_cl = 3 GeV\n**T1_cl = 1 GeV**\n\n### 6. Calculate the Difference\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the relativistic and classical values and convert it to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV).\n*   Difference = T1_rel - T1_cl\n*   Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV\n*   Difference in MeV = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = **5 MeV**\n\n```python\n# Constants and given values in GeV\nMc2 = 300.0  # Rest-mass energy of the initial nucleus\n\n# Calculate rest-mass energies of the fragments\nm1c2 = 0.66 * Mc2\nm2c2 = 0.33 * Mc2\n\n# Total kinetic energy released (Q-value)\nQ = Mc2 - (m1c2 + m2c2)\n\n# Relativistic calculation of T1\n# From conservation of momentum: p1^2 = p2^2\n# (p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2)\n# T1^2 + 2*T1*m1c2 = T2^2 + 2*T2*m2c2\n# With T2 = Q - T1, we get a linear equation for T1:\n# T1 = (Q^2 + 2*Q*m2c2) / (2*Q + 2*m1c2 + 2*m2c2)\n# Simpler derivation from the thought process: 600 * T1 = 603\nT1_relativistic = 603 / 600\n\n# Classical calculation of T1\n# T1 + T2 = Q and T1/T2 = m2/m1\n# T1 + T1*(m1/m2) = Q\n# T1 * (1 + m1/m2) = Q\n# m1/m2 = (0.66*M)/(0.33*M) = 2\n# T1 * (1 + 2) = Q\n# 3 * T1 = Q\nT1_classical = Q / 3.0\n\n# Calculate the difference in MeV\ndifference_GeV = T1_relativistic - T1_classical\ndifference_MeV = difference_GeV * 1000\n\nprint(f\"Relativistic T1: {T1_relativistic:.3f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Classical T1: {T1_classical:.3f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Difference: {difference_MeV:.1f} MeV\")\n```\nRelativistic T1: 1.005 GeV\nClassical T1: 1.000 GeV\nDifference: 5.0 MeV\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus of mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is given as `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`. Since it's at rest, its total energy is its rest-mass energy, and its momentum is zero.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`. These fragments are in motion.\n\n**2. Determine the Rest Masses of the Fragments**\n\nWe are given two pieces of information about the fragments' masses:\n1.  One fragment is twice as massive as the other: `m1 = 2 * m2`. (We'll call `m1` the more massive fragment).\n2.  The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\nWe can solve this system of equations:\n*   Substitute the first equation into the second: `(2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n*   `3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n*   `m2 = 0.33 * M`\n*   Now find `m1`: `m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNow, let's find their rest-mass energies using the initial energy `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`:\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 1 (`m1`): `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M*c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 2 (`m2`): `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M*c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy released as kinetic energy comes from the mass that was \"lost\" in the fission process (converted from mass energy to kinetic energy).\n*   Initial Energy = `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`\n*   Final Rest Energy = `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 198 GeV + 99 GeV = 297 GeV`\n*   Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value) = `Initial Energy - Final Rest Energy`\n*   `Q = T1 + T2 = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n**4. Relativistic Calculation of T1 (Correct Value)**\n\nWe must use two conservation laws:\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total kinetic energy is shared between the fragments: `T1 + T2 = Q = 3 GeV`.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The initial nucleus was at rest (momentum = 0), so the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta: `|p1| = |p2|`.\n\nWe use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`. We can rearrange this to solve for momentum: `(p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2`.\nSince `E = T + m*c^2` (Total Energy = Kinetic Energy + Rest-mass Energy), we can write:\n`(p*c)^2 = (T + m*c^2)^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2)`\n\nNow, apply `|p1| = |p2|`, which means `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`:\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n\nWe have a system of two equations for T1 and T2:\n1.  `T2 = 3 - T1`\n2.  `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(99)`\n\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\nThe `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n`396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n`396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n`396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1_relativistic = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n\n**5. Classical Calculation of T1 (Approximation)**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   From conservation of momentum, `p1 = p2 = p_classical`.\n*   So, `T1 = p_classical^2 / (2*m1)` and `T2 = p_classical^2 / (2*m2)`.\n*   Let's find the ratio of the kinetic energies: `T1/T2 = (p_classical^2 / 2*m1) / (p_classical^2 / 2*m2) = m2 / m1`.\n*   Since `m1 = 2*m2`, the ratio `m2/m1 = 1/2`. So, `T1/T2 = 1/2` or `T2 = 2*T1`.\n*   Now use the conservation of energy: `T1 + T2 = Q = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substitute `T2 = 2*T1`: `T1 + 2*T1 = 3 GeV`\n*   `3*T1 = 3 GeV`\n*   `T1_classical = 1 GeV`\n\n**6. Calculate the Difference**\n\nFinally, find the difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation.\n*   Difference = `T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.0 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nThe question asks for the answer in MeV. We convert GeV to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n*   Difference = `0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
