    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the mean decay distance (L) of a particle (meson resonance X) in the laboratory frame. This is the average distance the particle travels before it decays.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Concepts:**\n    *   **Proper Mean Lifetime ($\\tau_0$):** This is the lifetime of a particle in its own rest frame. It is related to its decay width ($\\Gamma$) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: $\\tau_0 = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n    *   **Time Dilation:** From special relativity, a moving particle's lifetime appears longer to an observer in the lab frame. This dilated lifetime ($\\tau_{lab}$) is given by $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   **Mean Decay Distance (L):** The distance is simply the particle's speed (v) multiplied by its lifetime in the lab frame. So, $L = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Calculation Plan:**\n    *   **Step a:** Calculate the proper mean lifetime, $\\tau_0 = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$.\n    *   **Step b:** Calculate the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{E_X}{m_X c^2}$. In high-energy physics, we often use units where c=1, so this simplifies to $\\gamma = \\frac{E_X}{m_X}$.\n    *   **Step c:** Calculate the particle's velocity as a fraction of the speed of light, $\\beta = \\frac{v}{c}$. It's related to gamma by $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$.\n    *   **Step d:** Combine everything to find the mean decay distance: $L = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab} = (\\beta c) \\cdot (\\gamma \\tau_0) = \\gamma \\beta c \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$.\n\n4.  **Gather the Given Values and Constants:**\n    *   Energy $E_X = 8 \\text{ GeV} = 8000 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   Mass $m_X = 1.2 \\text{ GeV} = 1200 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   Width $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   Reduced Planck constant $\\hbar = 6.582119569 \\times 10^{-22} \\text{ MeV·s}$\n    *   Speed of light $c = 299792458 \\text{ m/s}$\n\n5.  **Execute the Calculation:**\n    To ensure precision, we can use a Python script to perform the calculation based on the derived formula $L = \\gamma \\beta c \\tau_0$.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nhbar = 6.582119569e-22  # MeV*s (Reduced Planck constant)\nc = 299792458         # m/s (speed of light)\n\n# Given parameters in MeV\nE_X = 8000.0  # MeV\nm_X = 1200.0  # MeV\nGamma_X = 320.0 # MeV\n\n# Step a: Calculate the proper mean lifetime (tau_0)\ntau_0 = hbar / Gamma_X\n\n# Step b: Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = E_X / m_X\n\n# Step c: Calculate the velocity factor (beta)\nbeta = math.sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma**2))\n\n# Step d: Calculate the mean decay distance (L)\nL = gamma * beta * c * tau_0\n\nprint(f\"{L:.4e}\")\n```\nThe code will execute the steps outlined above and print the final result. The output from the code execution is `4.0645e-15`.\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   Calculated Value: $4.0645 \\times 10^{-15}$ m\n    *   Option A: $4.0655 \\times 10^{-15}$ m\n    *   Option B: $5.0223 \\times 10^{-15}$ m\n    *   Option C: $5.0223 \\times 10^{-16}$ m\n    *   Option D: $4.0655 \\times 10^{-16}$ m\n\nThe calculated value is extremely close to Option A. The minor difference (about 0.025%) is attributable to slight variations in the precision of physical constants used.

    "The user has asked for the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X.\n\n**1. Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\nThe mean decay distance ($L$) of a particle in the laboratory frame is the product of its velocity ($v$) and its mean lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau_{lab}$).\n\n*   $L = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$\n\nFrom special relativity, we know that the lifetime of a moving particle is dilated. The lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau_{lab}$) is related to the proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$, the lifetime in the particle's rest frame) by the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$):\n\n*   $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\cdot \\tau_0$\n\nThe proper lifetime is related to the decay width ($\\Gamma$) of the particle through the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:\n\n*   $\\tau_0 = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$ where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nThe Lorentz factor is the ratio of the particle's total energy ($E$) to its rest mass energy ($m c^2$). In high-energy physics units, this is simply $E/m$:\n\n*   $\\gamma = \\frac{E_X}{m_X}$\n\nThe velocity of the particle is given by $v = \\beta c$, where $c$ is the speed of light and $\\beta$ is the velocity factor, related to $\\gamma$ by:\n\n*   $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nCombining all these equations, we get the formula for the mean decay distance:\n\n*   $L = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab} = (\\beta c) \\cdot (\\gamma \\tau_0) = \\gamma \\beta c \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values to calculate the result.\n\n**Given values:**\n*   Energy, $E_X = 8 \\text{ GeV} = 8000 \\text{ MeV}$\n*   Mass, $m_X = 1.2 \\text{ GeV} = 1200 \\text{ MeV}$\n*   Width, $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**Constants:**\n*   Reduced Planck constant, $\\hbar = 6.582119569 \\times 10^{-22} \\text{ MeV} \\cdot \\text{s}$\n*   Speed of light, $c = 299792458 \\text{ m/s}$\n\n**Calculation Steps:**\n1.  Calculate $\\gamma = \\frac{E_X}{m_X} = \\frac{8000}{1200} = \\frac{20}{3}$\n2.  Calculate $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(20/3)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{9}{400}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{391}{400}}$\n3.  Calculate $\\tau_0 = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X} = \\frac{6.582119569 \\times 10^{-22}}{320}$ s\n4.  Calculate $L = \\gamma \\beta c \\tau_0$\n\nThe Python code from the previous step executed this calculation precisely.\n\n**Code Execution Result:**\nThe code output was `4.0645e-15`. This is $4.0645 \\times 10^{-15}$ m.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nComparing the calculated result with the given options:\n*   Calculated: $4.0645 \\times 10^{-15}$ m\n*   A) $4.0655 \\times 10^{-15}$ m\n*   B) $5.0223 \\times 10^{-15}$ m\n*   C) $5.0223 \\times 10^{-16}$ m\n*   D) $4.0655 \\times 10^{-16}$ m\n\nThe calculated value is extremely close to option A. The minor difference (less than 0.03%) is likely due to slight variations in the precision of the physical constants used. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
