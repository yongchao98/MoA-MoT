    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Number of Signals and Integration:**\nThe spectrum shows four distinct signals, indicating four different types of protons in the molecule.\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H):** One proton.\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H):** One proton.\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H):** Three protons, characteristic of a methyl group (CH₃).\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H):** Three protons, also a methyl group (CH₃).\n\nThe total number of protons is 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 8.\nLet's check the molecular formulas of the options:\n*   Propenyl acetate (C₅H₈O₂): 3 (in CH₃) + 1 (in CH) + 1 (in CH) + 3 (in acetate CH₃) = 8 protons. This matches.\n*   Butenyl acetate (C₆H₁₀O₂): 3 (in CH₃) + 2 (in CH₂) + 1 (in CH) + 1 (in CH) + 3 (in acetate CH₃) = 10 protons. This does not match the integration data.\n\nBased on the total proton count, we can eliminate the butenyl acetate options (B and D). The compound must be either Cis-propenyl acetate or Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n**2. Analyze Chemical Shifts and Splitting Patterns (Multiplicity):**\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** A singlet (s) means these three protons have no adjacent non-equivalent protons. The chemical shift of ~2.1 ppm is highly characteristic of the methyl group in an acetate ester (CH₃-C(=O)-O-). This confirms the \"acetate\" part of the name.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz) and 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** These signals are in the vinylic region (protons on a C=C double bond).\n    *   These two protons are on adjacent carbons of the double bond and are splitting each other.\n    *   The signal at **7.0 ppm** is a doublet (d), meaning it is split by only one other proton (the one at 5.5 ppm). Its downfield shift is due to the strong deshielding effect of the adjacent oxygen atom from the ester group (-O-C=O).\n    *   The signal at **5.5 ppm** is a doublet of quartets (dq). The \"doublet\" part comes from being split by the vinylic proton at 7.0 ppm. The \"quartet\" part must come from being split by an adjacent methyl group (n+1 rule: 3 protons -> 3+1 = 4 lines, a quartet).\n\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This is a methyl group in the aliphatic region. It is a doublet (d), meaning it is split by one adjacent proton. This matches the observation from the 5.5 ppm signal; this methyl group is adjacent to the proton at 5.5 ppm.\n\n**3. Assemble the Structure:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the structure has the following fragments:\n*   An acetate group: CH₃-C(=O)-O-\n*   A double bond with two protons: -CH=CH-\n*   A methyl group attached to the double bond: CH₃-CH=\n\nPutting them together, the connectivity is CH₃-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH₃, which is propenyl acetate.\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans):**\n\nThe final piece of information is the coupling constant (J-value) between the two vinylic protons (at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm), which is given as **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n*   For vinylic protons, a **large** coupling constant (typically 12-18 Hz) is characteristic of a **trans** relationship.\n*   A **smaller** coupling constant (typically 6-12 Hz) is characteristic of a **cis** relationship.\n\nSince J = 16.0 Hz, the protons on the double bond are in a **trans** configuration.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe compound is identified as **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
