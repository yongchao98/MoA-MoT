    "This problem requires us to identify which mutation is most likely to result in a complete loss of function for the protein produced by the target gene. A complete loss of function is the most reliable way to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nLet's analyze the effects of each type of mutation on the final protein product. The original gene sequence starts with `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT...-3’`. We can translate this into an amino acid sequence using the genetic code.\n\n*   **ATG** codes for Methionine (M), which is the start codon.\n*   **TTT** codes for Phenylalanine (F).\n*   **CTC** codes for Leucine (L).\n*   **GCT** codes for Alanine (A).\n\nSo, the original, intact protein begins with the sequence: **Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-...**\n\nNow, let's examine each mutant sequence to see how the mutation alters this protein sequence.\n\n1.  **Mutant 1:**\n    *   Intact sequence: 5’-ATG TTT **CTC** GCT...-3’\n    *   Mutant sequence: 5’-ATG TTC **TAC** GCT...-3’\n    *   Let's translate the mutated part:\n        *   **TTC** still codes for Phenylalanine (F). This is a silent (synonymous) mutation.\n        *   **TAC** codes for Tyrosine (Y).\n    *   The resulting protein sequence is **Met-Phe-Tyr-Ala-...**\n    *   This is a **missense mutation**, where one amino acid (Leucine) is replaced by another (Tyrosine). While this change *might* disrupt the protein's function, it is not guaranteed. The protein could still be partially or fully functional. Therefore, this is not the most probable option for completely eliminating the compound.\n\n2.  **Mutant 2:**\n    *   Intact sequence: 5’-ATG TTT **CTC**...-3’\n    *   Mutant sequence: 5’-ATG TTC **TAA**...-3’\n    *   Let's translate the mutated part:\n        *   **TTC** still codes for Phenylalanine (F).\n        *   **TAA** is a **STOP codon**.\n    *   When the ribosome encounters a stop codon, it terminates translation. The resulting protein sequence is just **Met-Phe**.\n    *   This is a **nonsense mutation**. Because it occurs so early in the gene (at the third codon), it produces a severely truncated, non-functional protein. This is almost certain to eliminate the protein's activity.\n\n3.  **Mutant 3:**\n    *   Intact sequence: 5’-ATGTTT**CTC**GCT...-3’\n    *   Mutant sequence: 5’-ATGTTT**T**ACGC...-3’ (There appears to be an insertion of a 'T' after the sixth nucleotide).\n    *   Let's see how this affects the reading frame:\n        *   Original frame: ATG | TTT | CTC | GCT | ... (Met | Phe | Leu | Ala | ...)\n        *   Mutant frame: ATG | TTT | **T**AC | GCT | ... (This is not right, the frame shifts)\n        *   Corrected mutant frame: ATG | TTT | **TCT** | **CGC** | TGG |... (Met | Phe | Ser | Arg | Trp | ...)\n    *   This is a **frameshift mutation**. The insertion of a single nucleotide changes the reading frame for all subsequent codons. The resulting amino acid sequence is completely different from the original, and a premature stop codon is likely to be encountered downstream. Like a nonsense mutation, a frameshift is very likely to result in a non-functional protein.\n\n4.  **Mutant 4:**\n    *   This sequence appears to have both an insertion and a deletion, making it a complex mutation. It would also likely cause a frameshift and lead to a non-functional protein.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWe are looking for the mutation that will **most probably** eliminate the compound. Both a nonsense mutation (Mutant 2) and a frameshift mutation (Mutant 3 and likely 4) are highly effective at knocking out gene function. However, a nonsense mutation that introduces a stop codon very early in the sequence is the most direct and definitive way to ensure a non-functional product. It terminates protein synthesis entirely at that point, leading to a severely truncated protein (only 2 amino acids long in this case). This is a classic and unambiguous method for creating a null allele (a non-functional gene). Therefore, Mutant 2 represents the highest probability of success.\n\nLet's use a Python script to confirm the translations.\n```python\ndef translate_dna(seq):\n    \"\"\"Translates a DNA sequence into a protein sequence until a stop codon is found.\"\"\"\n    table = {\n        'ATA':'I', 'ATC':'I', 'ATT':'I', 'ATG':'M',\n        'ACA':'T', 'ACC':'T', 'ACG':'T', 'ACT':'T',\n        'AAC':'N', 'AAT':'N', 'AAA':'K', 'AAG':'K',\n        'AGC':'S', 'AGT':'S', 'AGA':'R', 'AGG':'R',\n        'CTA':'L', 'CTC':'L', 'CTG':'L', 'CTT':'L',\n        'CCA':'P', 'CCC':'P', 'CCG':'P', 'CCT':'P',\n        'CAC':'H', 'CAT':'H', 'CAA':'Q', 'CAG':'Q',\n        'CGA':'R', 'CGC':'R', 'CGG':'R', 'CGT':'R',\n        'GTA':'V', 'GTC':'V', 'GTG':'V', 'GTT':'V',\n        'GCA':'A', 'GCC':'A', 'GCG':'A', 'GCT':'A',\n        'GAC':'D', 'GAT':'D', 'GAA':'E', 'GAG':'E',\n        'GGA':'G', 'GGC':'G', 'GGG':'G', 'GGT':'G',\n        'TCA':'S', 'TCC':'S', 'TCG':'S', 'TCT':'S',\n        'TTC':'F', 'TTT':'F', 'TTA':'L', 'TTG':'L',\n        'TAC':'Y', 'TAT':'Y', 'TAA':'_STOP_', 'TAG':'_STOP_',\n        'TGC':'C', 'TGT':'C', 'TGA':'_STOP_', 'TGG':'W',\n    }\n    protein = \"\"\n    # Process the sequence in codons (3 bases)\n    for i in range(0, len(seq) - (len(seq) % 3), 3):\n        codon = seq[i:i+3]\n        amino_acid = table.get(codon, 'X') # Use X for unknown codons\n        if amino_acid == '_STOP_':\n            break\n        protein += amino_acid\n    return protein\n\n# The sequences provided in the question have some inconsistencies, so we will focus on the key codons that define the mutation type.\nintact_gene = \"ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\"\n# To analyze the specific effect, we create plausible sequences representing each mutation type.\n# Mutant 1 (Missense): Change CTC to TAC\nmutant_1_plausible = \"ATGTTTTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\"\n# Mutant 2 (Nonsense): Change CTC to TAA\nmutant_2_plausible = \"ATGTTTTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\"\n# Mutant 3 (Frameshift): Insert a T after TTT\nmutant_3_plausible = \"ATGTTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\"\n\n\nprint(f\"Intact Protein:   {translate_dna(intact_gene)}\")\nprint(f\"Mutant 1 Protein (Missense): {translate_dna(mutant_1_plausible)}\")\nprint(f\"Mutant 2 Protein (Nonsense):  {translate_dna(mutant_2_plausible)}\")\nprint(f\"Mutant 3 Protein (Frameshift):{translate_dna(mutant_3_plausible)}\")\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "*   **Goal:** To eliminate an anti-nutritional compound by mutating the gene responsible for its synthesis. This means we are looking for the mutation most likely to cause a complete loss of function of the resulting protein. This is often called a \"knockout\" or \"null\" mutation.\n\n*   **Analysis of the Intact Gene:**\n    *   The gene sequence begins with `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT...-3’`.\n    *   `ATG` is the start codon, coding for Methionine (Met).\n    *   The ribosome reads the sequence in groups of three called codons.\n    *   Intact codons and their corresponding amino acids:\n        *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Met)\n        *   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine (Phe)\n        *   `CTC` -> Leucine (Leu)\n        *   `GCT` -> Alanine (Ala)\n    *   So, the normal, functional protein starts with the amino acid sequence: Met-Phe-Leu-Ala...\n\n*   **Analysis of the Mutants:** We need to determine the effect of each mutation on the final protein.\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:**\n        *   The sequence shows a change from `...CTC...` (Leucine) to `...TAC...` (Tyrosine).\n        *   Original protein: Met-Phe-**Leu**-Ala...\n        *   Mutant 1 protein: Met-Phe-**Tyr**-Ala...\n        *   This is a **missense mutation**: one amino acid is swapped for another. This might disrupt the protein's function, or it might have little to no effect. It is not a guaranteed way to eliminate the protein's activity.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:**\n        *   The sequence shows a change from `...CTC...` (Leucine) to `...TAA...`.\n        *   `TAA` is a **STOP codon**.\n        *   When the ribosome reads `TAA`, it terminates translation.\n        *   Original protein: Met-Phe-Leu-Ala...\n        *   Mutant 2 protein: Met-Phe-STOP. The resulting product is just a tiny two-amino-acid peptide (a dipeptide).\n        *   This is a **nonsense mutation**. Because it occurs so early in the gene (at the third codon), the resulting protein is severely truncated and is virtually certain to be non-functional.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:**\n        *   Comparing the intact and mutant strings reveals a probable **frameshift mutation**. An extra nucleotide has been inserted, which shifts the \"reading frame\" of the codons.\n        *   Original frame: `ATG | TTT | CTC | GCT | ...`\n        *   Mutant frame (example of an insertion): `ATG | TTT | T`**C**`TC | GCT | ...` becomes `ATG | TTT | TCT | CGC | ...`\n        *   This changes every single amino acid from the point of the mutation onwards. A frameshift almost always leads to a completely non-functional protein, and often introduces a premature stop codon downstream. This is also a very effective way to knock out a gene.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:**\n        *   This mutation appears to be a deletion of three nucleotides (`GGT`).\n        *   Since three nucleotides make up one codon, this is an **in-frame deletion**.\n        *   The result is a protein that is simply missing one amino acid. Like a missense mutation, this might or might not disable the protein. It is less likely to cause a complete loss of function compared to a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   We are looking for the mutation that will **most probably** eliminate the compound. Both a frameshift (Mutant 3) and a nonsense mutation (Mutant 2) are highly likely to create a non-functional protein.\n    *   However, the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a STOP codon at the very beginning of the protein sequence (the 3rd codon). This immediately terminates translation, producing a useless dipeptide. This is the most direct and certain way among the choices to guarantee a complete loss of function. Therefore, it is the most probable to achieve the desired outcome.\n\n<<<C>>>"
