    "This problem is about the energy-time uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. Let's break down the reasoning.\n\n1.  **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle**: The core concept is the energy-time uncertainty principle, which states:\n    ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    where:\n    *   ΔE is the uncertainty in the energy of a quantum state.\n    *   Δt is the lifetime of that state (the time interval over which it exists).\n    *   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h / 2π).\n\n2.  **Energy Broadening**: A consequence of this principle is that a state with a finite lifetime (Δt) cannot have a perfectly defined energy. Its energy is \"broadened\" or \"smeared out\" by an amount ΔE. We can approximate this energy width as:\n    ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt\n\n3.  **Resolving Energy Levels**: To \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two different energy levels, the difference in their central energies must be larger than their energy widths. If the energy difference is smaller than the broadening, the two levels will overlap so much that they appear as a single, broader level. The resolvability is limited by the state with the *larger* energy broadening.\n\n4.  **Identify the Limiting State**:\n    *   State 1 has a lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s.\n    *   State 2 has a lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s.\n    *   Since ΔE is inversely proportional to the lifetime (ΔE ≈ ħ/τ), the state with the *shorter* lifetime will have the *larger* energy broadening.\n    *   Therefore, State 1 (τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s) is the limiting factor. Its energy level is broader than that of State 2.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Energy Broadening**: We need to calculate the energy width (ΔE₁) for State 1. The energy difference between the two states must be greater than this width.\n\n    *   ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁\n\n    We can perform this calculation using the value of the reduced Planck constant in units of eV·s, which is ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n```python\n# Define the reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nh_bar_eVs = 6.582e-16  # eV*s\n\n# Lifetimes of the two states\ntau1 = 1e-9  # seconds\ntau2 = 1e-8  # seconds\n\n# Calculate the energy broadening (uncertainty) for each state\ndelta_E1 = h_bar_eVs / tau1\ndelta_E2 = h_bar_eVs / tau2\n\nprint(f\"Energy broadening of State 1 (lifetime {tau1} s): {delta_E1:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy broadening of State 2 (lifetime {tau2} s): {delta_E2:.3e} eV\")\nprint(\"\\nTo resolve the two levels, the energy difference between them must be larger than the broadening of the wider level (State 1).\")\nprint(f\"Therefore, the required energy difference must be > {delta_E1:.3e} eV.\")\n\n```\nExecution Output:\n```\nEnergy broadening of State 1 (lifetime 1e-09 s): 6.582e-07 eV\nEnergy broadening of State 2 (lifetime 1e-08 s): 6.582e-08 eV\n\nTo resolve the two levels, the energy difference between them must be larger than the broadening of the wider level (State 1).\nTherefore, the required energy difference must be > 6.582e-07 eV.\n```\n\n6.  **Compare with Options**: Based on the calculation, the energy difference between the two levels, |E₁ - E₂|, must be greater than approximately 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV. Now let's evaluate the given options:\n    *   A) 10⁻⁴ eV: This is much greater than 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV. (10⁻⁴ > 6.58 x 10⁻⁷)\n    *   B) 10⁻⁸ eV: This is smaller than 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   C) 10⁻¹¹ eV: This is much smaller than 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   D) 10⁻⁹ eV: This is smaller than 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nOnly option A provides an energy separation large enough to clearly resolve the two states, as it is the only value greater than the intrinsic energy width of the shorter-lived state.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The user's question asks for the minimum energy difference required to distinguish two quantum states with given lifetimes.\n\n1.  **Understand the Principle**: The problem is governed by the energy-time uncertainty principle, ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2. This principle implies that a quantum state with a finite lifetime (Δt) has an inherent uncertainty or \"broadening\" in its energy (ΔE).\n\n2.  **Calculate Energy Broadening**: The energy width (ΔE) of a state with lifetime τ can be approximated as ΔE ≈ ħ/τ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\n3.  **Identify the Limiting Factor**:\n    *   State 1 has a lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s.\n    *   State 2 has a lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s.\n    *   Since energy broadening is inversely proportional to lifetime, the state with the *shorter* lifetime will have the *larger* energy broadening. Therefore, State 1 is the limiting factor.\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation**: We need to calculate the energy width of State 1, as this is the larger of the two energy widths.\n    *   ΔE₁ = ħ / τ₁\n    *   ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s)\n    *   ΔE₁ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n5.  **Apply the Resolution Condition**: To clearly resolve or distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference between them, |E₁ - E₂|, must be greater than the energy broadening of the wider level. In this case, the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the half-widths, but a common and safe criterion is that it must be larger than the largest of the two widths.\n    *   |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁\n    *   |E₁ - E₂| > 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Options**: We compare the given options to this required minimum energy difference:\n    *   A) 10⁻⁴ eV: This is greater than 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV. (10⁻⁴ = 1000 × 10⁻⁷)\n    *   B) 10⁻⁸ eV: This is less than 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   C) 10⁻¹¹ eV: This is much less than 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   D) 10⁻⁹ eV: This is less than 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nOnly option A provides an energy separation that is significantly larger than the intrinsic energy broadening of the shorter-lived state, allowing the two levels to be clearly resolved.\n\n<<<A>>>"
