    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Information Provided:**\n    *   **Molecular Framework:** \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This indicates a benzene ring (C6H4) with two groups attached to it.\n    *   **Carbon Count:** \"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\". Since the benzene ring itself accounts for 6 carbon atoms, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):**\n        *   \"carbonyl group\" (C=O).\n        *   \"aromatic-halogen bond\" (Ar-X). This means a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the aromatic ring.\n\n2.  **Determine the Molecular Structure:**\n    *   We have two substituents on a benzene ring.\n    *   One substituent is a halogen atom (-X). This substituent has 0 carbon atoms.\n    *   The other substituent must therefore contain both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n    *   Let's consider possible structures for a 2-carbon substituent containing a carbonyl group:\n        *   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** This fits the criteria (2 carbons, one C=O).\n        *   **Formylmethyl group (-CH2CHO):** This also fits the criteria (2 carbons, one C=O).\n        *   **Carboxymethyl group (-CH2COOH):** This fits, but carboxylic acids have a very characteristic broad OH peak in the FTIR and a very downfield proton (>10 ppm) in the 1H NMR, which is not suggested by all options.\n    *   Based on these possibilities, the most likely molecular structures are a halo-acetophenone (X-C6H4-COCH3) or a halo-phenylacetaldehyde (X-C6H4-CH2CHO).\n\n3.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Options:**\n    *   A di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4) should show signals for 4 aromatic protons, typically in the range of 6.5-8.5 ppm.\n    *   **Option A) 1H NMR: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**: This spectrum shows no signals in the aromatic region (> 6.5 ppm). Therefore, it cannot be the correct answer.\n    *   **Option B) 1H NMR: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**: This spectrum shows only one aromatic proton (1H). A di-substituted benzene ring must have four. Therefore, it cannot be the correct answer.\n    *   **Option C) 1H NMR: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**:\n        *   The signal at **9.9 ppm (1H, s)** is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). This would suggest the structure is a halo-phenylacetaldehyde (X-C6H4-CH2CHO).\n        *   The signal at **3.7 ppm (2H, s)** would correspond to the -CH2- group.\n        *   The signals at **7.8 ppm (2H, d)** and **7.6 ppm (2H, d)** are from the 4 aromatic protons. The pattern of two doublets suggests *para* substitution.\n        *   **Critique:** In a phenylacetaldehyde structure, the electron-withdrawing aldehyde group is insulated from the ring by a -CH2- group. Its effect on the aromatic proton chemical shifts is weakened. The aromatic protons for a compound like *p*-chlorophenylacetaldehyde appear around 7.2-7.3 ppm. The shifts of 7.8 and 7.6 ppm are too far downfield for this structure.\n    *   **Option D) 1H NMR: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**:\n        *   The signal at **2.3 ppm (3H, s)** is characteristic of a methyl group next to a carbonyl (an acetyl group, -COCH3). This suggests the structure is a halo-acetophenone (X-C6H4-COCH3).\n        *   The signals at **7.8 ppm (2H, d)** and **7.6 ppm (2H, d)** are from the 4 aromatic protons. The pattern of two doublets suggests *para* substitution.\n        *   **Critique:** In a *p*-haloacetophenone structure, the strongly electron-withdrawing carbonyl group is directly attached to the aromatic ring, causing the ortho protons to shift significantly downfield. The halogen also influences the shifts. This combination perfectly explains the downfield aromatic signals at 7.8 and 7.6 ppm. For instance, the actual spectrum of *p*-bromoacetophenone is ~7.82 (d), ~7.60 (d), ~2.59 (s). Option D is an excellent match for this structure.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The molecule that fits all the given information (di-substituted aromatic, 8 carbons, C=O, Ar-X) and matches the NMR data is a *para*-haloacetophenone. Option D provides the spectrum that corresponds to this structure.\n\n<<<D>>>"
