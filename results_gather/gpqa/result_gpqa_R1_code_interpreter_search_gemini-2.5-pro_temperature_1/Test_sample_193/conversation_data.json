    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the System:**\n    The system consists of three spins: S1, S2, and S3. Each spin can take one of two possible values: +1 (spin up) or -1 (spin down). The total number of possible configurations (microstates) of the system is 2 * 2 * 2 = 8.\n\n2.  **Identify the Energy Function (Hamiltonian):**\n    The energy of the system for any given configuration is given by the formula:\n    E = -J [S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3]\n    where J is a constant.\n\n3.  **Define the Partition Function (Z):**\n    The partition function Z is a fundamental quantity in statistical mechanics that describes the statistical properties of a system in thermodynamic equilibrium. It is defined as the sum of the Boltzmann factors over all possible microstates of the system:\n    Z = Σ_states e^(-βE)\n    where β = 1/(kT), k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy for Each Microstate:**\n    We need to list all 8 possible microstates, calculate the energy for each one, and then group them by energy value to find the degeneracy (the number of states with the same energy).\n\n    Let's list the states as (S1, S2, S3):\n\n    *   **Case 1: All spins are the same.**\n        *   State 1: (+1, +1, +1)\n            E₁ = -J [(+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J [1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n        *   State 2: (-1, -1, -1)\n            E₂ = -J [(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J [1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n        So, we have an energy level E₁ = -3J with a degeneracy g₁ = 2.\n\n    *   **Case 2: Two spins are up (+1) and one is down (-1).**\n        *   State 3: (+1, +1, -1)\n            E₃ = -J [(+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J [1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n        *   State 4: (+1, -1, +1)\n            E₄ = -J [(+1)(-1) + (+1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J [-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n        *   State 5: (-1, +1, +1)\n            E₅ = -J [(-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J [-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n        There are 3 states in this category.\n\n    *   **Case 3: One spin is up (+1) and two are down (-1).**\n        *   State 6: (+1, -1, -1)\n            E₆ = -J [(+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J [-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n        *   State 7: (-1, +1, -1)\n            E₇ = -J [(-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J [-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n        *   State 8: (-1, -1, +1)\n            E₈ = -J [(-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J [1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n        There are 3 states in this category as well.\n\n    Combining Case 2 and Case 3, we have an energy level E₂ = +J with a degeneracy g₂ = 3 + 3 = 6.\n\n5.  **Summarize Energy Levels and Degeneracies:**\n    *   Energy Level E₁ = -3J, Degeneracy g₁ = 2\n    *   Energy Level E₂ = +J, Degeneracy g₂ = 6\n    (Total states checked: g₁ + g₂ = 2 + 6 = 8, which is correct).\n\n6.  **Calculate the Partition Function Z:**\n    The partition function is the sum of the contributions from each energy level:\n    Z = g₁ * e^(-βE₁) + g₂ * e^(-βE₂)\n    Substituting the values we found:\n    Z = 2 * e^(-β * (-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β * (J))\n    Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated expression for the partition function is Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ).\n    Let's check the given options:\n    A) Z= 2 e^(3Jβ)+6e^(-Jβ)\n    B) Z= 2e^(2Jβ)+6e^(-2Jβ)\n    C) Z= 6e^(2Jβ)+2e^(-2Jβ)\n    D) Z= 2 e^(-3Jβ)+6e^(Jβ)\n\n    Our result matches option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>"
