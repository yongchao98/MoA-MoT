    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays of particle $X^0$. \"Observing a decay\" implies that the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector's resolution ($L_{res}$) before it decays. If it decays before traveling this distance, its track is too short to be resolved from the production point. Therefore, the fraction of \"observed\" decays is the fraction of particles that survive for a distance greater than or equal to $L_{res}$.\n\n2.  **Relativistic Decay:** The particle $X^0$ is relativistic, so its lifetime in the lab frame is time-dilated. The probability of a particle surviving a certain time $t$ in the lab frame follows an exponential decay law. This can be translated into a probability of surviving a certain distance $x$.\n\n3.  **Key Formulas:**\n    *   **Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$):** Relates the total energy ($E$) of a particle to its rest mass energy ($mc^2$).\n        $E = \\gamma mc^2 \\implies \\gamma = \\frac{E}{mc^2}$\n    *   **Mean decay length ($\\lambda$):** The average distance a particle travels in the lab frame before decaying. It is related to the particle's velocity ($v$) and its lab-frame lifetime ($\\tau$).\n        $\\lambda = v \\tau$\n    *   **Lab-frame lifetime ($\\tau$):** The time-dilated lifetime.\n        $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$, where $\\tau_0$ is the proper lifetime.\n    *   **Velocity ($v$):** Can be expressed using the Lorentz factor or momentum. A precise way to calculate the decay length is using momentum:\n        $\\lambda = \\frac{p}{m}\\tau_0$ is incorrect. The correct formula is $\\lambda = v\\tau = v \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n        We can express $v\\gamma$ in terms of momentum $p$: $p = \\gamma m v \\implies v\\gamma = p/m$.\n        So, $\\lambda = \\frac{p}{m}\\tau_0$. Let's be careful with units. Using energy units (GeV):\n        $p = \\frac{pc}{c}$ and $m = \\frac{mc^2}{c^2}$. So $\\frac{p}{m} = \\frac{pc/c}{mc^2/c^2} = \\frac{pc}{mc^2}c$.\n        Therefore, $\\lambda = \\left(\\frac{pc}{mc^2}\\right) c \\tau_0$.\n        The momentum term $pc$ can be found from the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$.\n        $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}$\n    *   **Decay Probability vs. Distance:** The fraction of particles that survive after traveling a distance $L$ is given by:\n        $P(L) = e^{-L/\\lambda}$\n4.  **Set up the Equation:** We want the fraction of observed decays to be at least 30%. This means the fraction of particles surviving a distance $L_{res}$ must be at least 0.30.\n    $e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n    The question asks for the \"minimum resolution\". A smaller resolution is better (it allows observing more decays). So, the question is likely asking for the maximum possible resolution that still allows observing 30% of the decays. This corresponds to the equality:\n    $e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n    Solving for $L_{res}$:\n    $-\\frac{L_{res}}{\\lambda} = \\ln(0.30)$\n    $L_{res} = -\\lambda \\ln(0.30)$\n\n5.  **Calculate the values:**\n    *   **Given:**\n        *   $E = 27$ GeV\n        *   $mc^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n        *   $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n        *   $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n    *   **Calculate $pc$:**\n        $pc = \\sqrt{27^2 - 3.41^2} = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78$ GeV\n    *   **Calculate the mean decay length $\\lambda$:**\n        $\\lambda = \\left(\\frac{pc}{mc^2}\\right) c \\tau_0 = \\left(\\frac{26.78}{3.41}\\right) \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n        $\\lambda \\approx 7.854 \\times (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n    *   **Calculate the resolution $L_{res}$:**\n        $\\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$\n        $L_{res} = -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times (-1.204) \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated value is $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. Looking at the options:\n    A) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n    B) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\n    C) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\n    D) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\n\n    The calculated value is closest to option A. The discrepancy of about 9% might be due to slight inaccuracies in the problem's given values. Given the choices, A is the only plausible answer.\n\nLet's use a Python script for a more precise calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given values ---\nE_gev = 27.0  # Total energy in GeV\nm_c2_gev = 3.41  # Rest mass energy in GeV\ntau0_s = 8e-16  # Proper lifetime in seconds\nc_ms = 299792458  # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# 1.

Calculate the mean decay length (lambda) in the lab frame\n# lambda = (pc / mc^2) * c * tau0\nlam_m = (pc_gev / m_c2_gev) * c_ms * tau0_s\n\n# 3. Calculate the required resolution (L)\n# The fraction of particles surviving after distance L is P(L) = exp(-L/lambda)\n# We need P(L) = 0.30\n# L = -lambda * ln(0.30)\nL_m = -lam_m * math.log(0.30)\n\nprint(f\"{L_m:.3e}\")\n```\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The user has provided the output from the python code I generated. The output is `2.268e-06`. My task is to analyze this result and provide the final answer.\n\n### Analysis of the Calculation and Result\n\n1.  **Recap of the Method:**\n    *   The problem asks for the minimum resolution ($L_{res}$) needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of particle $X^0$.\n    *   Observing a decay means the particle's track length is greater than the resolution.\n    *   The fraction of particles that survive a distance $L$ follows the exponential decay law: $P(L) = e^{-L/\\lambda}$, where $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length in the lab frame.\n    *   The condition is $e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$. To find the boundary condition (the maximum possible resolution that still works), we solve for $L_{res}$ in $e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$.\n    *   This gives $L_{res} = -\\lambda \\ln(0.30)$.\n    *   The mean decay length $\\lambda$ is given by $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{mc^2} c \\tau_0$, where $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}$.\n\n2.  **Calculation using provided values:**\n    *   Energy ($E$) = 27 GeV\n    *   Rest Mass Energy ($mc^2$) = 3.41 GeV\n    *   Proper Lifetime ($\\tau_0$) = $8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n    *   Speed of light ($c$) = $2.998 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n\n3.  **Code Execution Output:**\n    *   The Python code executed these calculations precisely and returned the result: $L_{res} \\approx 2.268 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n4.  **Comparison with Options:**\n    *   A) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n    *   B) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\n    *   C) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\n    *   D) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\n\n    The calculated value is $2.268 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The closest option is A, which is $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The other options differ by several orders of magnitude and are incorrect. The small discrepancy between the calculated result and option A (about 8-9%) is likely due to minor inconsistencies in the values provided in the problem statement or rounding used when the question was created. Given the choices, option A is the only physically plausible answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
