    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (`M_sys1`) to the total mass of system_2 (`M_sys2`). This ratio is `M_sys1 / M_sys2`.\n\n2.  **Recall the Relevant Physics:** The total mass of a binary star system (`M_total = m1 + m2`) can be determined from its orbital properties. For a double-lined spectroscopic binary (where we can measure the radial velocities of both stars), the total mass is related to the orbital period (P) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocity curves (K1 and K2). The formula is derived from Kepler's Third Law.\n\n3.  **The Formula:** The total mass `M_total` is given by:\n    `M_total = (P * (K1 + K2)^3) / (2 * pi * G * sin^3(i))`\n    where:\n    *   `P` is the orbital period.\n    *   `K1` and `K2` are the radial velocity semi-amplitudes of the two stars.\n    *   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n    *   `i` is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between our line of sight and the axis of the orbit).\n\n4.  **Use Key Information:** The problem states that both systems are **eclipsing**. This is a critical piece of information. For eclipses to occur, our line of sight must be very close to the orbital plane. This means the inclination angle `i` must be close to 90 degrees.\n    *   If `i ≈ 90°`, then `sin(i) ≈ 1`, and therefore `sin^3(i) ≈ 1`.\n\n5.  **Simplify the Formula:** With `sin^3(i) ≈ 1`, the formula simplifies to:\n    `M_total ≈ (P * (K1 + K2)^3) / (2 * pi * G)`\n    Since `2 * pi * G` is a constant, we can establish a proportionality:\n    `M_total ∝ P * (K1 + K2)^3`\n\n6.  **Set up the Ratio:** We can now find the ratio of the mass of system_1 to system_2 by dividing their respective proportionalities. The constant term `1 / (2 * pi * G)` will cancel out.\n    `Ratio = M_sys1 / M_sys2 = (P1 * (K1_1 + K1_2)^3) / (P2 * (K2_1 + K2_2)^3)`\n\n7.  **Gather the Data:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   `P1 = 2` years\n        *   `K1_1 = 10` km/s\n        *   `K1_2 = 5` km/s\n        *   Sum of velocities = `K1_1 + K1_2 = 10 + 5 = 15` km/s\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   `P2 = 1` year\n        *   `K2_1 = 15` km/s\n        *   `K2_2 = 10` km/s\n        *   Sum of velocities = `K2_1 + K2_2 = 15 + 10 = 25` km/s\n\n8.  **Calculate the Ratio:** Substitute the values into the ratio formula. We can use years for the period and km/s for velocity, as the units will cancel out in the ratio.\n    `Ratio = (2 * (15)^3) / (1 * (25)^3)`\n    `Ratio = 2 * (15 / 25)^3`\n    `Ratio = 2 * (3 / 5)^3`\n    `Ratio = 2 * (27 / 125)`\n    `Ratio = 54 / 125`\n\n9.  **Compute the Final Value:**\n    `Ratio = 0.432`\n\n10. **Compare with Options:** The calculated value `0.432` is closest to option C, which is `~ 0.4`.\n\nTo confirm the calculation, a simple python script can be used.\n```python\n# Data for System 1\nP1 = 2.0  # Period in years\nK1_1 = 10.0 # Velocity amplitude in km/s\nK1_2 = 5.0  # Velocity amplitude in km/s\n\n# Data for System 2\nP2 = 1.0  # Period in years\nK2_1 = 15.0 # Velocity amplitude in km/s\nK2_2 = 10.0 # Velocity amplitude in km/s\n\n# The total mass is proportional to P * (K_sum)^3\n# Calculate the sum of velocity amplitudes for each system\nV_sum_1 = K1_1 + K1_2\nV_sum_2 = K2_1 + K2_2\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the total mass of system 1 to system 2\nmass_ratio = (P1 * (V_sum_1**3)) / (P2 * (V_sum_2**3))\n\nprint(mass_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.432\n</execute_result>\n\nThe calculation is confirmed to be 0.432, which rounds to approximately 0.4.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The total mass (`M_total = m1 + m2`) of a double-lined spectroscopic binary system can be determined from the orbital period (P) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocity curves (K1 and K2). The governing equation, derived from Kepler's Third Law, is:\n\n`M_total * sin^3(i) = (P / (2 * π * G)) * (K1 + K2)^3`\n\nwhere:\n*   `i` is the inclination of the orbit to the line of sight.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\nA crucial piece of information is that both systems are **eclipsing**. For eclipses to happen, our line of sight must be very close to the orbital plane, which means the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90°.\n\nFor `i ≈ 90°`, we have `sin(i) ≈ 1`, and therefore `sin^3(i) ≈ 1`. This simplifies the mass equation to:\n\n`M_total ≈ (P / (2 * π * G)) * (K1 + K2)^3`\n\nSince `(1 / (2 * π * G))` is a constant, we can establish a proportionality for the total mass:\n\n`M_total ∝ P * (K1 + K2)^3`\n\nWe want to find the ratio of the mass of system 1 (`M_sys1`) to the mass of system 2 (`M_sys2`). We can do this by taking the ratio of their proportional expressions, which will cause the constant terms to cancel out:\n\n`M_sys1 / M_sys2 = (P1 * (K1_1 + K1_2)^3) / (P2 * (K2_1 + K2_2)^3)`\n\nNow, let's plug in the values from the problem:\n\n**For system_1:**\n*   `P1 = 2` years\n*   `K1_1 = 10` km/s\n*   `K1_2 = 5` km/s\n*   Sum of velocities = `K1_1 + K1_2 = 10 + 5 = 15` km/s\n\n**For system_2:**\n*   `P2 = 1` year\n*   `K2_1 = 15` km/s\n*   `K2_2 = 10` km/s\n*   Sum of velocities = `K2_1 + K2_2 = 15 + 10 = 25` km/s\n\nNow, substitute these into the ratio equation:\n\n`M_sys1 / M_sys2 = (2 * (15)^3) / (1 * (25)^3)`\n`M_sys1 / M_sys2 = 2 * (15/25)^3`\n`M_sys1 / M_sys2 = 2 * (3/5)^3`\n`M_sys1 / M_sys2 = 2 * (27 / 125)`\n`M_sys1 / M_sys2 = 54 / 125`\n`M_sys1 / M_sys2 = 0.432`\n\nThe calculated factor is `0.432`, which is approximately `0.4`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
