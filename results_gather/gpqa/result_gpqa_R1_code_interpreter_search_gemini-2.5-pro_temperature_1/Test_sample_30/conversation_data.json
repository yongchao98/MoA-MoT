    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the molecular symmetry group of product 3.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Toluene is treated with nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a classic electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction, specifically the nitration of toluene. The methyl group (-CH3) is an activating group and an ortho-, para-director. This means the incoming nitro group (-NO2) will be directed to the positions ortho (2 or 6) or para (4) to the methyl group. Due to steric hindrance from the methyl group, the para-substituted product is typically the major product.\n*   **Product 1:** p-nitrotoluene (or 4-nitrotoluene).\n\n     \n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (p-nitrotoluene) is treated with manganese dioxide (MnO2) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** MnO2 in an acidic medium is a strong oxidizing agent. It will oxidize the alkyl side chain of the benzene ring. A benzylic methyl group is typically oxidized to a carboxylic acid (-COOH) by strong oxidants. However, the subsequent reaction (Step 3) involves acetone and NaOH, which is characteristic of a Claisen-Schmidt condensation. This reaction requires an aldehyde that lacks α-hydrogens. Therefore, it is most plausible that the oxidation is controlled to stop at the aldehyde stage. This is a common pattern in multi-step synthesis problems where the outcome of a step is dictated by the requirements of the next.\n*   **Product 2:** p-nitrobenzaldehyde (or 4-nitrobenzaldehyde).\n\n     \n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (p-nitrobenzaldehyde) is treated with acetone ((CH3)2C=O) and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a base-catalyzed crossed aldol condensation, specifically a Claisen-Schmidt condensation, between an aldehyde with no α-hydrogens (p-nitrobenzaldehyde) and a ketone with α-hydrogens (acetone).\n    1.  The hydroxide ion (OH-) removes an acidic α-proton from acetone to form a nucleophilic enolate ion.\n    2.  The enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of p-nitrobenzaldehyde.\n    3.  The resulting aldol addition product quickly undergoes dehydration (loses a molecule of water) under the reaction conditions to form a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated ketone. The trans (E) isomer is sterically favored and is the major product.\n*   **Product 3:** (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n\n     \n\n**Step 4: Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of Product 3**\n\n*   **Structure:** The final product is (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** To find the molecular point group, we look for the symmetry elements present in the molecule.\n    *   The molecule possesses a large conjugated π-system (benzene ring, C=C double bond, C=O double bond). To maximize conjugation, the heavy-atom framework of the molecule is essentially planar.\n    *   **Plane of Symmetry (σ):** The plane that contains the benzene ring, the ethylene bridge (-CH=CH-), and the acetyl group (-C(O)CH3) is a plane of symmetry. It reflects the top half of the molecule onto the bottom half.\n    *   **Axis of Rotation (Cn):** There are no proper axes of rotation (for n>1). For example, a 180° rotation (C2) around any axis will not leave the molecule unchanged because the two ends of the molecule are different (a nitro group vs. an acetyl group).\n    *   **Center of Inversion (i):** There is no center of inversion. If you start at the nitrogen atom and go through the center of the molecule to the other side, you do not find another nitrogen atom.\n*   **Conclusion:** The only symmetry elements present in the molecule are the identity element (E), which all molecules have, and a single plane of symmetry (σ). A molecule that possesses only these two elements belongs to the **Cs** point group.\n\nFinal Answer Check:\n*   C2h: Requires E, C2, i, σh. Molecule lacks C2 and i.\n*   Cs: Requires E, σ. This matches our finding.\n*   D2h: A high-symmetry group. Molecule lacks the required three C2 axes, etc.\n*   C3: Requires a C3 axis. Molecule lacks a 3-fold rotation axis.\n\nThe correct molecular symmetry group is Cs.\n\n<<<B>>>"
