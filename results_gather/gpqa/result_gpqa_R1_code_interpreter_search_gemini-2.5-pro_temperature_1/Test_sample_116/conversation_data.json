    "*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n    Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality are the presence of a chiral center (an atom bonded to four different groups) or the presence of an axis of chirality (as seen in atropisomers). A molecule is achiral (not chiral) if it possesses a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n*   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. Biphenyls consist of two phenyl rings connected by a carbon-carbon single bond.\n    *   Rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings is possible. However, this molecule has large, bulky substituents (nitro groups, -NO₂, and ester groups, -COOCH₃) at all the ortho-positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6').\n    *   These bulky groups cause significant steric hindrance, which prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely and becoming coplanar.\n    *   This restricted rotation locks the molecule into a conformation where the two rings are twisted relative to each other.\n    *   The resulting molecule does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Its mirror image is non-superimposable.\n    *   This phenomenon is called atropisomerism, which is a form of axial chirality. Therefore, this compound is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   The chemical structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the hydroxyl group, -OH).\n    *   This carbon atom is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since this carbon atom is attached to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center (or asymmetric carbon).\n    *   A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   The chemical structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. A central carbonyl group is bonded to two phenyl rings.\n    *   The molecule is not chiral. It possesses a plane of symmetry that includes the central C=O group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   Because it has a plane of symmetry, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   Therefore, benzophenone is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two ester groups in a *trans* configuration across the carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   The molecule is planar.\n    *   It possesses a center of inversion (a point of symmetry) at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. If you draw a line from any atom through this central point, you will find an identical atom at the same distance on the opposite side.\n    *   The presence of a center of inversion makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n    Based on the analysis, compounds 1 (due to atropisomerism) and 2 (due to a chiral center) are chiral and will show optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral. Thus, the correct option includes only 1 and 2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
