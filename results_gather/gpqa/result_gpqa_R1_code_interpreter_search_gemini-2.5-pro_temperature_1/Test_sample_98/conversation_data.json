    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic spectroscopic feature for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the carboxylic acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position is typical for the carbonyl group within a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group present but does not differentiate between the isomers.\n\n### **2. Analysis of 1H NMR Data**\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of protons attached to C=C double bonds. All four given structures are saturated alkanoic acids, which is consistent with this observation.\n*   **Key Splitting Patterns:** The most distinctive information comes from the complex splitting patterns (multiplets) described:\n    *   One signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    *   A different signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n\nTo understand these patterns, let's break down what they mean in terms of neighboring protons according to the n+1 rule:\n*   **Doublet (d):** The proton is coupled to 1 adjacent proton (a CH group).\n*   **Triplet (t):** The proton is coupled to 2 equivalent adjacent protons (a CH₂ group).\n*   **Quartet (q):** The proton is coupled to 3 equivalent adjacent protons (a CH₃ group).\n\nTherefore:\n*   A proton that appears as a **dtq** must be a single proton (a CH methine group) that has three distinct neighboring groups: another CH group, a CH₂ group, and a CH₃ group.\n*   A proton that appears as a **dtt** must be a single proton (a CH methine group) that has three distinct neighboring groups: another CH group and two different CH₂ groups.\n\n### **3. Analysis of Each Proposed Structure**\n\nNow, let's examine each of the four possible structures to see if its protons would produce these specific splitting patterns. We will use IUPAC names for clarity.\n\n**A) `CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH`**\nThis condensed formula represents **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**.\nLet's draw and label the structure for analysis (numbering from the COOH group):\n```\n        CH₂-CH₃ (from C4-ethyl)\n        |\n(5)CH₃-CH(4)-CH(3)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)\n             |\n             CH₂-CH₃ (from C3-ethyl)\n```\n*   **Proton on C3 (H-3):** This proton is on a chiral center. Its neighbors are:\n    *   The CH₂ group at C2 (2 protons → gives a **triplet**).\n    *   The CH group at C4 (1 proton → gives a **doublet**).\n    *   The CH₂ group of the ethyl substituent on C3 (2 protons → gives a **triplet**).\n    Therefore, the signal for H-3 will be a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the observed signals.\n\n*   **Proton on C4 (H-4):** This proton is also on a chiral center. Its neighbors are:\n    *   The CH group at C3 (1 proton → gives a **doublet**).\n    *   The CH₃ group at C5 (3 protons → gives a **quartet**).\n    *   The CH₂ group of the ethyl substituent on C4 (2 protons → gives a **triplet**).\n    Therefore, the signal for H-4 will be a **doublet of quartets of triplets (dqt)**. This is a permutation of `dtq` and arises from the same set of neighbors (CH, CH₂, CH₃). The order of the letters (d, q, t) depends on the relative magnitudes of the coupling constants (J-values), but the multiplicity and the neighbors are correct. This matches the other observed signal.\n\n**Conclusion for A:** Structure A is consistent with having both a `dtt` signal and a `dtq`-type signal.\n\n**B) `CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH`**\nThis is **2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**.\n*   **H-3:** Neighbors are H-2 (CH), H-4 (CH₂), and the C3-methyl (CH₃). This gives a **dtq** signal.\n*   **H-2:** Neighbors are H-3 (CH) and the C2-methyl (CH₃). This gives a doublet of quartets (dq).\nThis structure has a `dtq` signal but lacks a `dtt` signal.\n\n**C) `CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH`**\nThis is **2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**.\n*   **H-3:** Neighbors are H-2 (CH), H-4 (CH₂), and the C3-ethyl (CH₂). This gives a **dtt** signal.\n*   **H-2:** Neighbors are H-3 (CH) and the C2-ethyl (CH₂). This gives a doublet of triplets (dt).\nThis structure has a `dtt` signal but lacks a `dtq` signal.\n\n**D) `CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH`**\nThis is **3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**.\n*   **H-3:** Neighbors are H-2 (CH₂), H-4 (CH), and the C3-methyl (CH₃). This gives a **tdq** (or `dtq`-type) signal.\n*   **H-4:** Neighbors are H-3 (CH) and the two C4-methyl groups (6 protons). This gives a doublet of septets (ds).\nThis structure has a `dtq`-type signal but lacks a `dtt` signal.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nOnly structure **A (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)** has two different methine (CH) protons that match the described NMR splitting patterns: one proton (H-3) gives a `dtt` signal, and another proton (H-4) gives a `dqt` (or `dtq`) signal. Therefore, the unknown compound is the one represented by formula A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
