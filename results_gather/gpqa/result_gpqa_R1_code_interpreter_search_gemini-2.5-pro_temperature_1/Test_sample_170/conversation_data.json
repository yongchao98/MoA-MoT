    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n### Step 1: Classify the substituents\nFirst, we need to classify the substituent on each benzene ring (C6H5-) as either *ortho, para*-directing or *meta*-directing. This classification determines the primary positions of substitution.\n\n*   **Activating groups** are *ortho, para*-directing.\n*   **Deactivating groups** are *meta*-directing (with the exception of halogens).\n*   **Halogens** are deactivating but *ortho, para*-directing.\n\nLet's classify the substituents for substances 1-6:\n1.  **-CH3 (in Toluene)**: An alkyl group. It is **activating** and ***ortho, para*-directing**.\n2.  **-COOC2H5 (in Ethyl benzoate)**: An ester group. The carbonyl (C=O) makes it electron-withdrawing. It is **deactivating** and ***meta*-directing**.\n3.  **-Cl (in Chlorobenzene)**: A halogen. It is **deactivating** but ***ortho, para*-directing**.\n4.  **-NO2 (in Nitrobenzene)**: A nitro group. It is strongly electron-withdrawing. It is a **strong deactivator** and ***meta*-directing**.\n5.  **-C2H5 (in Ethylbenzene)**: An alkyl group. It is **activating** and ***ortho, para*-directing**.\n6.  **-COOH (in Benzoic acid)**: A carboxylic acid group. The carbonyl (C=O) makes it electron-withdrawing. It is **deactivating** and ***meta*-directing**.\n\nSo we have two groups of substances:\n*   **Meta-directors**: 4 (-NO2), 2 (-COOC2H5), 6 (-COOH)\n*   **Ortho, para-directors**: 1 (-CH3), 5 (-C2H5), 3 (-Cl)\n\n### Step 2: Order the substances within each group\n\n**A. Meta-directors (4, 2, 6)**\n\nFor meta-directors, the main product is the meta-isomer. The yield of the ortho and para isomers is very low. We need to arrange them in order of increasing para-isomer yield. A stronger deactivating and meta-directing group will lead to a higher proportion of the meta product and consequently a lower proportion of the para product.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength (and thus meta-directing strength) for these groups is:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n\n*   **-NO2 (4)** is the strongest deactivator, so it will give the lowest yield of the para-isomer (typically <1%).\n*   **-COOH (6)** is a strong deactivator, stronger than the ester group. It will give a very low yield of the para-isomer (typically 1-2%).\n*   **-COOC2H5 (2)** is also a strong deactivator, but generally considered slightly weaker than -COOH. It will give a low, but slightly higher, yield of the para-isomer compared to -COOH (typically ~5%).\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for the meta-directors is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**B. Ortho, para-directors (1, 3, 5)**\n\nFor ortho, para-directors, the substitution occurs primarily at the ortho and para positions. The ratio of para to ortho product (p/o ratio) determines the percentage yield of the para-isomer. The p/o ratio is influenced by:\n*   **Steric Hindrance**: Larger substituents will block the ortho positions, leading to a higher yield of the para product. The size of the incoming electrophile (bromine) is also significant.\n*   **Electronic Effects**: For halogens like -Cl, the strong deactivating inductive effect is felt more at the ortho position than the para position, which also increases the p/o ratio.\n\nLet's compare the three groups:\n*   **-CH3 (1, Toluene)**: This is a relatively small group. It gives a significant amount of both ortho and para products. For bromination, the para-isomer yield is typically around 67%.\n*   **-C2H5 (5, Ethylbenzene)**: This group is bulkier than -CH3. The increased steric hindrance at the ortho positions leads to a higher proportion of the para product compared to toluene.\n*   **-Cl (3, Chlorobenzene)**: This group's size is comparable to a methyl group, but its electronic properties are different. The deactivating inductive effect of chlorine disfavors the ortho positions more than the para position, leading to a high p/o ratio.\n\nComparing the para-yields is complex and can depend on reaction conditions. However, a common trend observed for nitration (a similar electrophilic substitution) is that the electronic effect in chlorobenzene leads to a very high para percentage, while the steric effect of the ethyl group also increases the para percentage relative to toluene. The established order of para-isomer yield for nitration is: Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene. While bromination involves a larger electrophile (making sterics more important), this established chemical trend is likely what the question is based on.\n\nIf we assume this order, we get: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### Step 3: Combine the groups\n\nThe para-isomer yield for any *meta*-director will be significantly lower than for any *ortho, para*-director. So, we place the ordered list of meta-directors before the ordered list of ortho, para-directors.\n\n*   Meta-director order: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Ortho, para-director order: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nCombining these gives the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis sequence matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
