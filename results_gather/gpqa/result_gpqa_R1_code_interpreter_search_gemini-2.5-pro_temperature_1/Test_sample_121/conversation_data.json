    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Synthesis of Product 1**\n*   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. This reaction halogenates the alpha-carbon of a carboxylic acid. The alpha-carbon in acetic acid is the methyl group.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Synthesis of Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Fischer esterification reaction, where a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Synthesis of Product 3**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a nucleophilic substitution reaction (SN2). The cyanide ion (CN-) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion (Br-), which is a good leaving group.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Product 4**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a sequence of deprotonation and alkylation reactions.\n    1.  **First deprotonation:** NaH is a strong base that removes the acidic alpha-proton from ethyl cyanoacetate. The alpha-protons are acidic because they are flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (a cyano group, -CN, and an ethoxycarbonyl group, -COOEt). This forms a resonance-stabilized carbanion (enolate).\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    2.  **First alkylation:** The enolate attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction, displacing a bromide ion.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br⁻\n    3.  **Second deprotonation:** The problem states *excess* NaH is used. The product from the first alkylation still has one acidic alpha-proton, which is removed by another equivalent of NaH.\n        NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    4.  **Intramolecular alkylation (Cyclization):** The newly formed carbanion undergoes an intramolecular SN2 reaction. It attacks the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromide ion to form a cyclic compound. The ring formed consists of the alpha-carbon and the five carbons of the pentane chain, resulting in a six-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4 (Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate)**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the molecule.\n\n1.  **Stereochemistry:** The C1 carbon of the cyclohexane ring is attached to four different groups:\n    *   A cyano group (-CN)\n    *   An ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3)\n    *   A ring connection via C2 (-CH2-CH2-...)\n    *   A ring connection via C6 (-CH2-CH2-...)\n    Although the paths around the ring are constitutionally identical, C1 is a stereocenter because the molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion in any of its stable conformations. The molecule is chiral.\n\n2.  **Signal Counting:** Since the molecule is chiral, we analyze one of its enantiomers. In a chiral molecule, there is no plane of symmetry to make corresponding protons on opposite sides of the ring equivalent.\n    *   **Ring Protons:**\n        *   The five methylene (-CH2-) groups on the cyclohexane ring (at positions C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6) are all in chemically different environments.\n        *   Furthermore, within each of these five CH2 groups, the two protons are diastereotopic (they have a different spatial relationship to the substituents on the chiral center C1).\n        *   Therefore, each of the five CH2 groups will give rise to two distinct signals.\n        *   Number of signals from ring protons = 5 CH2 groups × 2 signals/group = **10 signals**.\n\n    *   **Ethyl Group Protons (-O-CH2-CH3):**\n        *   The three protons of the methyl (-CH3) group are chemically equivalent due to free rotation and will produce **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the methylene (-O-CH2-) group are technically diastereotopic because they are part of an ethyl group attached to a chiral molecule. In a strictly rigorous count, they would give 2 signals. However, the chiral center is somewhat distant (C1-CO-O-CH2), and the difference in chemical shift is often negligible. In the context of multiple-choice questions, it is a common simplification to count such protons as a single signal. If we count them as one signal, they produce **1 signal**.\n\n3.  **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   Summing up the signals: 10 (from the ring) + 1 (from the ethyl -CH3) + 1 (from the ethyl -O-CH2-) = **12 signals**.\n\nThis number matches one of the options. A fully rigorous count would give 13 signals, which is not an option, suggesting the simplification for the ethyl methylene protons is intended. The simplified model that ignores chirality would yield 5 signals, which contradicts the instruction to identify all chemically distinct hydrogens. Therefore, 12 is the most logical answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
