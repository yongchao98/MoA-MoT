    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$.\n\n**1. Understand the Definition of Uncertainty**\n\nIn quantum mechanics, the uncertainty (or standard deviation) of an observable $A$ in a state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is given by the formula:\n$$ \\Delta A = \\sqrt{\\langle A^2 \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle^2} $$\nwhere $\\langle A \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|A|\\psi\\rangle$ is the expectation value of $A$, and $\\langle A^2 \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|A^2|\\psi\\rangle$ is the expectation value of $A^2$.\n\n**2. Identify the Given Information**\n\nWe are given:\n*   The matrix for the operator $P_z$:\n    $$ P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} $$\n*   The state of the system, which is a column vector $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n    $$ |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe corresponding bra vector $\\langle\\psi|$ is the conjugate transpose of $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$$ \\langle\\psi| = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nWe can quickly verify that the state is normalized: $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = (-1/2)^2 + (1/\\sqrt{2})^2 + (-1/2)^2 = 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = 1$.\n\n**3. Calculate the Expectation Value $\\langle P_z \\rangle$**\n\nWe compute $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|P_z|\\psi\\rangle$.\nFirst, let's calculate $P_z|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$$ P_z|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar \\cdot (-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar \\cdot (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nNow, multiply by $\\langle\\psi|$ from the left:\n$$ \\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|(P_z|\\psi\\rangle) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ \\langle P_z \\rangle = (-1/2)(-\\hbar/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(\\hbar/2) = \\frac{\\hbar}{4} + 0 - \\frac{\\hbar}{4} = 0 $$\n\n**4. Calculate the Expectation Value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$**\n\nFirst, we need the matrix for the operator $P_z^2$:\n$$ P_z^2 = P_z \\cdot P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nNow, we compute $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|P_z^2|\\psi\\rangle$. Let's calculate $P_z^2|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$$ P_z^2|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 \\cdot (-1/2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar^2 \\cdot (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nNow, multiply by $\\langle\\psi|$ from the left:\n$$ \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|(P_z^2|\\psi\\rangle) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = (-1/2)(-\\hbar^2/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(-\\hbar^2/2) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} + 0 + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} = \\frac{2\\hbar^2}{4} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} $$\n\n**5. Calculate the Uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$**\n\nNow we use the uncertainty formula with the values we calculated:\n$$ \\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - (0)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}} $$\n$$ \\Delta P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}} $$\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
