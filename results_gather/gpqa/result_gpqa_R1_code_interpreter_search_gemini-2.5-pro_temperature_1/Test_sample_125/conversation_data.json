    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral ketone. It has one existing stereocenter at carbon 5 (C5), and its configuration is specified as (S).\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺). LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone functional group (C=O) at C3 to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   **Product Formation and Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter.\n    *   The hydride ion (H⁻) from LAH can attack the planar carbonyl group from either the top face or the bottom face. This results in the formation of two possible configurations at the new stereocenter: (R) and (S).\n    *   The original stereocenter at C5 is not involved in the reaction, so its (S) configuration remains unchanged.\n    *   Therefore, two products are formed:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship between Products:** Since the products have one stereocenter that is the same (5S) and one that is different (3R vs. 3S), they are **diastereomers**.\n\n### **2. Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), followed by an acidic workup. NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups. The use of \"excess\" reagent ensures that both ketones are fully reduced.\n*   **Product Formation and Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The reduction of the two ketone groups at C2 and C4 creates two new stereocenters, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   Let's analyze the relationships:\n        *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, so they form a **pair of enantiomers**.\n        *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** has an internal plane of symmetry (passing through the C3 methylene group). A molecule with stereocenters and an internal plane of symmetry is a **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration represents the same meso compound.\n*   **Products:** Reaction II produces three stereoisomers in total: a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n\n### **3. Combine Products and Analyze with HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains all the products from both reactions, which are five distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol  (from Rxn I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol  (from Rxn I)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol    (from Rxn II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol    (from Rxn II)\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol        (from Rxn II)\n\nNow, let's determine how many peaks will be observed in each type of HPLC.\n\n#### **A) Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Separation Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, primarily polarity.\n*   **Separates:** Constitutional isomers and diastereomers.\n*   **Does NOT Separate:** Enantiomers, because they have identical physical properties (polarity, boiling point, etc.) in an achiral environment.\n*   **Peak Counting:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and **will be separated**, giving **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction II are the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) and the meso compound.\n        *   The enantiomeric pair will co-elute and appear as a **single peak**.\n        *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it has different properties and will be separated, giving a **second peak**.\n        *   So, the products of Reaction II give **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products of Reaction I (methoxy-alcohols) and Reaction II (diols) are constitutional isomers with significantly different polarities (diols are much more polar). They will be well-separated from each other.\n    *   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC = (Peaks from Rxn I) + (Peaks from Rxn II) = 2 + 2 = 4 peaks.**\n\n#### **B) Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Separation Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase, which interacts differently with each enantiomer of a chiral compound.\n*   **Separates:** All different stereoisomers, including enantiomers, diastereomers, and meso compounds.\n*   **Peak Counting:**\n    *   The five products are all unique stereoisomers. The chiral column will interact differently with each one, allowing for their separation.\n    *   Peak 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Peak 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Peak 3: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Peak 4: (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Peak 5: meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC = 5 peaks.**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows there will be **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
