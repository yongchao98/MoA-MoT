    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) → A\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is a Michael addition reaction. Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, sterically hindered base that will deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate. The enolate then acts as a nucleophile and adds to the α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate), which is the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Enolate (Nucleophile):**\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   The carbonyl group is at position C1. We need to identify the α-carbons, which are the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group (C2 and C6).\n    *   C2 is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has no α-protons. Therefore, deprotonation cannot occur at C2.\n    *   C6 is substituted with a methyl group and a hydrogen atom. It is a tertiary carbon and has one α-proton.\n    *   The base, t-BuOK, will deprotonate the only available α-proton at C6 to form the corresponding enolate. The negative charge (and the nucleophilic character) will be on C6.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition:**\n    *   The enolate attacks the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt).\n    *   The nucleophilic C6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon (the CH₂) of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n4.  **Structure of Product A:**\n    *   The initial structure of the ketone is: C1=O, C2(-Et, -Me), C6(-Me, -H).\n    *   After the reaction, the hydrogen at C6 is replaced by the `-(CH₂)₂COOEt` group from ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The resulting product has the following connectivity on the cyclohexane ring: C1=O, C2(-Et, -Me), C6(-Me, -CH₂CH₂COOEt). C6 is now a quaternary carbon.\n\n5.  **Naming Product A:**\n    *   We need to name the product structure: `ethyl 3-(...cyclohexyl)propanoate`. This naming convention treats the ethyl propanoate as the parent chain and the cyclohexyl ring as a substituent. The propanoate chain is attached to the ring at some position.\n    *   Let's renumber our product structure to match this naming style. The IUPAC rules for naming a substituted cycloalkane attached to a side chain can be complex, but the options guide us. The name in options C and D is `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`. Let's verify if our product matches this name.\n    *   Let's analyze the name:\n        *   The main chain is `ethyl propanoate`.\n        *   The substituent is on C3 of the propanoate chain.\n        *   The substituent is a `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)` group. The attachment to the propanoate is at C1 of the cyclohexyl ring.\n    *   Let's draw the structure from this name:\n        *   The cyclohexyl ring has an attachment point at C1.\n        *   C1 also has a methyl group.\n        *   C2 has an oxo (=O) group.\n        *   C3 has an ethyl group and a methyl group.\n    *   Now, let's compare this to our derived product structure `[C1=O, C2(-Et, -Me), C6(-Me, -CH₂CH₂COOEt)]`. We can renumber our structure:\n        *   Let Old C6 be New C1.\n        *   Let Old C1 be New C2.\n        *   Let Old C2 be New C3.\n    *   With this new numbering, the substituents are:\n        *   New C1 (was Old C6): has a methyl group and the attachment to the ethyl propanoate chain.\n        *   New C2 (was Old C1): has the oxo (=O) group.\n        *   New C3 (was Old C2): has an ethyl group and a methyl group.\n    *   This structure perfectly matches the name `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile (KOH, H₂O) → B\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is also a Michael addition. 1-Nitroalkanes have acidic protons on the α-carbon (the carbon bonded to the -NO₂ group). KOH is a strong base that will deprotonate the 1-nitropropane. The resulting nitronate anion is a good nucleophile. (E)-but-2-enenitrile is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile, which is a Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:**\n    *   The base (KOH) removes a proton from the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂C**H₂**-NO₂).\n    *   This forms the nucleophilic nitronate anion: [CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition:**\n    *   The Michael acceptor is (E)-but-2-enenitrile, which has the structure CH₃-CH=CH-CN.\n    *   The α-carbon is adjacent to the -CN group (C2), and the β-carbon is next to that (C3). Structure: C⁴H₃-C³H=C²H-C¹N.\n    *   The nucleophilic carbon (C1) of the nitronate anion attacks the electrophilic β-carbon (C3) of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between C1 of the nitropropane and C3 of the butenenitrile.\n\n4.  **Structure of Product B:**\n    *   The bond formation connects the `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)-` fragment to the `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` fragment (after protonation of the intermediate enolate/nitrile anion by water).\n    *   The final structure is: **CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN**\n\n5.  **Naming Product B:**\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so the suffix is `-nitrile`.\n    *   We identify the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon.\n    *   The chain is: **C⁶**H₃-**C⁵**H₂-**C⁴**H(NO₂)-**C³**H(CH₃)-**C²**H₂-**C¹**N.\n    *   The longest chain has 6 carbons, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   We number the chain starting from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The IUPAC name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Product **A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product **B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) A is incorrect.\nB) Both A and B are incorrect.\nC) Both A and B are correct.\nD) B is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
