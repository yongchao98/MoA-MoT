    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compounds and determine the molecular symmetry of E.\n\n1.  **Analyze Clue 4: \"D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.\"**\n    *   B and D are gases. H is a solvent.\n    *   A classic example of such a reaction is the formation of phosgene from carbon monoxide and chlorine gas:\n        CO (g) + Cl₂ (g) → COCl₂ (g/l)\n    *   Phosgene (COCl₂) has a boiling point of 8 °C, so it can be a gas or a liquid, and it is used as a solvent in some industrial processes.\n    *   Let's hypothesize: **B = CO** and **D = Cl₂** (or vice versa), and **H = COCl₂**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Clue 1: \"reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C.\"**\n    *   Using our hypothesis from step 1, B = CO.\n    *   The reaction is: A (solid) + 8 CO (gas) → C (bright red product).\n    *   This points towards the formation of a metal carbonyl. Dicobalt octacarbonyl, Co₂(CO)₈, is formed from cobalt metal and carbon monoxide. The stoichiometry is:\n        2 Co (s) + 8 CO (g) → Co₂(CO)₈ (s)\n    *   This reaction fits the 1:8 molar ratio if we consider the product C (Co₂(CO)₈) as the reference, which is common in such problems.\n    *   Let's check the properties:\n        *   A = Cobalt (Co), which is a solid.\n        *   C = Dicobalt octacarbonyl (Co₂(CO)₈), which is an orange-red crystalline solid. This matches \"bright red product\".\n    *   This hypothesis seems strong. So: **A = Co**, **B = CO**, **C = Co₂(CO)₈**.\n\n3.  **Verify the assignments with Clue 4.**\n    *   We assigned B = CO. The clue is D + B -> H.\n    *   So, D + CO -> COCl₂. This means **D = Cl₂**.\n    *   This confirms our initial assignments: **B = CO, D = Cl₂, H = COCl₂**.\n\n4.  **Analyze Clue 2: \"When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.\"**\n    *   C = Co₂(CO)₈ and D = Cl₂.\n    *   The reaction is: Co₂(CO)₈ + 2 Cl₂ → E.\n    *   Let's determine the products of this reaction. The reaction of dicobalt octacarbonyl with chlorine typically results in the cleavage of the Co-Co bond and loss of CO ligands to form cobalt(II) chloride and carbon monoxide.\n    *   The balanced chemical equation is:\n        Co₂(CO)₈ + 2 Cl₂ → 2 CoCl₂ + 8 CO\n    *   The product \"E\" is therefore a mixture of cobalt(II) chloride (CoCl₂) and carbon monoxide (CO).\n    *   Carbon monoxide (CO) is a well-known, highly toxic gas, fitting the description \"extremely hazardous\".\n\n5.  **Analyze Clue 3: \"C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.\"**\n    *   C = Co₂(CO)₈. A = Co.\n    *   The hydrolysis of Co₂(CO)₈ is complex. In acidic conditions, it is known to produce cobalt tetracarbonyl hydride (HCo(CO)₄), which is a strong acid (this would be F). The reaction also produces Co²⁺ ions. It doesn't directly reform Co metal (A), but this is a common simplification in chemical riddles. The weak acid (G) could be carbonic acid (H₂CO₃) formed from the CO ligands reacting with water. While this clue is not a perfect fit for a simple, direct reaction, it is plausible within the context of a puzzle and doesn't invalidate our hypothesis.\n\n6.  **Determine the molecular symmetry group of E.**\n    *   The question asks for the molecular symmetry group of E. We've identified E as the mixture of products: 2 CoCl₂ + 8 CO.\n    *   Since a mixture does not have a single molecular symmetry group, the question must be referring to one of the molecular products.\n    *   Let's analyze the symmetry of each product molecule:\n        *   **Carbon Monoxide (CO):** It is a linear, heteronuclear diatomic molecule. Its point group is **C∞v**. This is not among the given options.\n        *   **Cobalt(II) Chloride (CoCl₂):** In the gas phase, the CoCl₂ molecule is linear and symmetrical (Cl-Co-Cl). It has a C∞ rotational axis, an infinite number of perpendicular C₂ axes, a horizontal plane of symmetry (σₕ), and a center of inversion (i). This combination of symmetry elements corresponds to the **D∞h** point group.\n    *   The given options are A) D4h, B) D∞h, C) C2v, D) C2.\n    *   Our result for CoCl₂, D∞h, is option B. It is logical to conclude that the question, despite describing the hazardous nature of CO, asks for the symmetry of the other product, CoCl₂, as its point group is one of the choices.\n\nSummary of Identities:\n*   A = Co (Cobalt)\n*   B = CO (Carbon monoxide)\n*   C = Co₂(CO)₈ (Dicobalt octacarbonyl)\n*   D = Cl₂ (Chlorine)\n*   E = The product mixture {2 CoCl₂ + 8 CO}. The question refers to the CoCl₂ molecule.\n*   F = HCo(CO)₄ (Cobalt tetracarbonyl hydride)\n*   G = H₂CO₃ (Carbonic acid) or HCOOH (Formic acid)\n*   H = COCl₂ (Phosgene)\n\nThe molecular symmetry group of gaseous CoCl₂ is D∞h.\n\n<<<B>>>"
