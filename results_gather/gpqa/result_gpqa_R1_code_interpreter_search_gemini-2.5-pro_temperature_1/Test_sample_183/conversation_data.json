    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's dissect its structure:\n*   It's a benzene ring with three substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3.\n*   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt)\n*   Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu)\n*   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2)\n\nThe relative positions of the substituents are:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are **ortho** to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are **ortho** to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are **meta** to each other.\n\nThis 1,2,3-substitution pattern, especially with the bulky tert-butyl group flanked by two other groups, suggests a complex synthesis is required, likely involving careful control of directing effects, possibly with blocking groups.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents\n\nUnderstanding the directing effects of the groups (or their precursors) in Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS) is crucial.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl)**: Activating, ortho/para-director. Bulky, so it strongly favors the para position.\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy)**: Strongly activating, ortho/para-director.\n*   **-OH (hydroxyl)**: Precursor to -OEt. Strongly activating, ortho/para-director.\n*   **-NH2 (amino)**: Precursor to -OH (via diazotization). Very strongly activating, ortho/para-director. In strong acid, it becomes **-NH3+**, which is deactivating and a meta-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro)**: Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n*   **-SO3H (sulfonic acid)**: Deactivating, meta-director. Can be used as a removable blocking group.\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences\n\nLet's analyze the provided options. Many of the sequences as written contain chemically incorrect ordering of steps (e.g., diazotization before forming an amine). We must identify the most plausible intended chemical pathway. We will analyze the sequence in option D, which is the most coherent series of reaction *types*, assuming potential typos in the exact ordering.\n\n**Analysis of Option D**\n\nThe listed reagents suggest a specific strategy. Let's trace the reaction step-by-step, assuming we start with the major product at each stage to ensure a \"high-yield\" synthesis.\n\n*   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 on Benzene**: This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n    *   Product: **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n\n*   **ii) HNO3/H2SO4 on tert-Butylbenzene**: This is nitration. The -tBu group is an ortho, para-director, but due to its large steric bulk, the major product is overwhelmingly the para isomer.\n    *   Major Product: **p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene** (1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene).\n\n*   **iii) Fe/HCl on p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**: This is the reduction of a nitro group to an amino group.\n    *   Product: **p-tert-butylaniline** (4-tert-butylaniline).\n\n*   **iv) HNO3/H2SO4 on p-tert-butylaniline**: This is another nitration step. Under the strong acidic conditions of nitration, the amino group (-NH2) is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH3+).\n    *   We are nitrating the **p-tert-butyl anilinium ion**.\n    *   The -NH3+ group is a deactivating meta-director. It directs incoming electrophiles to positions 3 and 5 (meta to itself).\n    *   The -tBu group is an activating ortho, para-director. It directs to positions 2 and 6 (ortho to itself).\n    *   The positions ortho to the -tBu group (2 and 6) are also meta to the -NH3+ group. Therefore, the directing effects of both groups reinforce each other, guiding the incoming nitro group (NO2+) to position 2 (or 6, which is equivalent).\n    *   Product: **2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline**.\n\n*   **v) NaNO2/HCl on 2-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline**: This is the diazotization of the primary amino group.\n    *   Product: **2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenediazonium chloride**.\n\n*   **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat**: This reaction involves heating the diazonium salt in an aqueous acidic solution, which hydrolyzes it to a phenol.\n    *   Product: **2-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol**.\n\n*   **vii) NaOH/EtBr on 2-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol**: This is a Williamson ether synthesis. The base (NaOH) deprotonates the phenol to form a phenoxide ion, which then acts as a nucleophile to attack the ethyl bromide (EtBr), forming an ether.\n    *   Product: **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**.\n\n*   **viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4**: These final two steps as listed are chemically illogical. Sulfonating a finished product and then immediately removing the sulfonic acid group (desulfonation) would be redundant and inefficient. This suggests a likely typo in the option's construction.\n\n**Conclusion of the Analysis**\n\nThe logical sequence of reactions (i through vii) in option D leads to the synthesis of **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**. Let's compare this with the target molecule, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n*   **Product of sequence D**: Substituents at C1(-OEt), C2(-NO2), C4(-tBu).\n*   **Target Molecule**: Substituents at C1(-OEt), C2(-tBu), C3(-NO2).\n\nThese are different constitutional isomers. However, when comparing the four options, options A, B, and C contain more severe logical flaws in the ordering of fundamental reactions (e.g., attempting diazotization before reduction to an amine). The sequence of reaction *types* in option D (alkylation, nitration, reduction, further substitution, functional group conversion) is the most plausible and represents a valid, coherent synthesis of a complex trisubstituted benzene, despite yielding an isomer of the named target. In the context of a multiple-choice question that is likely flawed, option D represents the \"best\" and most chemically sound synthetic plan among the choices.\n\n<<<D>>>"
