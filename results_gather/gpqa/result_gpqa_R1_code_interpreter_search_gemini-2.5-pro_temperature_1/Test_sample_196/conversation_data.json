    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the IR Spectrum to Identify Functional Groups**\n    *   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This very broad absorption is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong peak is in the carbonyl region and is typical for the C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These absorptions indicate the presence of C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound (X) is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum to Determine the Structure**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This broad singlet far downfield is definitive for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-CO**H**). This confirms the IR analysis.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic signature of a *para* (1,4)-disubstituted benzene ring. The protons at 8.0 ppm are deshielded, suggesting they are *ortho* to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group. The protons at 7.2 ppm are less deshielded, suggesting they are *ortho* to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n    *   **Alkyl Chain Analysis (signals from 0.9 to 2.9 ppm):** We need to piece together the structure of the alkyl substituent.\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This gives us a -CH₂-CH₃ fragment (an ethyl group).\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methine group (-CH-). This gives us a -CH(CH₃)- fragment.\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons corresponds to the methylene group (-CH₂-) from the ethyl fragment. It is adjacent to the -CH₃ (making it a quartet) and the methine group (making it a doublet), resulting in a complex multiplet.\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton corresponds to the methine group (-CH-). It is attached to the benzene ring (benzylic position), the methyl group (doublet), and the methylene group (quartet), resulting in a complex multiplet.\n    *   **Assembling the Alkyl Group:** Putting the fragments together: The methine carbon (-CH-) is attached to the ring, a methyl group (-CH₃), and an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). This forms a **sec-butyl** group: -CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃.\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the Structure of Compound X**\n    *   Based on the analysis, Compound X is a benzoic acid with a *sec*-butyl group at the *para* position. The structure is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option (D).\n\n*   **Step 4: Identify the Reaction and Predict the Product**\n    *   The reaction involves treating Compound X with **red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI)**.\n    *   This combination (Red P / HI) is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   The reaction is the reduction of the carboxylic acid on the aromatic ring. The *sec*-butyl group is an alkane chain and will not be affected.\n    *   **Reaction:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid ---[Red P / HI]---> 4-(sec-butyl)toluene.\n    *   The IUPAC name for 4-(sec-butyl)toluene is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Step 5: Match the Final Product with the Given Options**\n    *   A) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: This matches our predicted product.\n    *   B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: Incorrect structure.\n    *   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: Incorrect alkyl isomer (isobutyl instead of sec-butyl).\n    *   D) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: This is the starting material (Compound X), not the final product.\n\nThe final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
