    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Normalization Principle:** In quantum mechanics, the wave function ψ(x) contains information about the probability of finding a particle at a certain position. The square of the magnitude of the wave function, |ψ(x)|², is the probability density function. The total probability of finding the particle anywhere it can exist must be 1. This is the normalization condition, which is expressed mathematically as:\n    ∫ |ψ(x)|² dx = 1\n    The integral is taken over the entire region where the particle can be found.\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   The wave function is given as: ψ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i\n    *   The particle is only found in the region between x = 1 and x = 3. Therefore, our limits of integration will be from 1 to 3.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Probability Density |ψ(x)|²:**\n    The wave function is a complex number. For any complex number z = r + i*j, its magnitude squared is |z|² = r² + j².\n    In our case, the wave function ψ(x) has:\n    *   A real part: Re(ψ) = a / sqrt(1 + x)\n    *   An imaginary part: Im(ψ) = -0.5\n\n    So, the probability density is:\n    |ψ(x)|² = [Re(ψ)]² + [Im(ψ)]²\n    |ψ(x)|² = [a / sqrt(1 + x)]² + (-0.5)²\n    |ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\n4.  **Set Up the Normalization Integral:**\n    Now we apply the normalization condition using the calculated probability density and the given limits of integration:\n    ∫[from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1\n\n5.  **Solve the Integral:**\n    We can split the integral into two parts:\n    ∫[from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x)) dx + ∫[from 1 to 3] 0.25 dx = 1\n\n    *   **First part:**\n        ∫[from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x)) dx = a² * ∫[from 1 to 3] (1 / (1 + x)) dx\n        The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x).\n        So, a² * [ln(1 + x)] evaluated from 1 to 3 becomes:\n        a² * [ln(1 + 3) - ln(1 + 1)] = a² * [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² * ln(4/2) = a² * ln(2)\n\n    *   **Second part:**\n        ∫[from 1 to 3] 0.25 dx = [0.25 * x] evaluated from 1 to 3 becomes:\n        0.25 * (3 - 1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5\n\n6.  **Solve for \"a\":**\n    Now, substitute the results back into the equation:\n    (a² * ln(2)) + 0.5 = 1\n\n    Isolate the term with \"a\":\n    a² * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5\n    a² * ln(2) = 0.5\n\n    Solve for a²:\n    a² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n\n    Solve for a by taking the square root:\n    a = sqrt(0.5 / ln(2))\n\n7.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    To find the numerical value of \"a\", we'll compute the expression.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the value of a = sqrt(0.5 / ln(2))\na = math.sqrt(0.5 / math.log(2))\nprint(a)\n```\nThe output of the code is approximately `0.8493`. This value is closest to the option 0.85.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "To solve this problem, we must use the normalization condition from quantum mechanics. The normalization condition states that the total probability of finding the particle in the region where it can exist must be equal to 1. This is mathematically expressed as:\n\n∫ |ψ(x)|² dx = 1\n\nWhere the integral is taken over the entire region where the particle can be found.\n\n1.  **Define the Wave Function and Region:**\n    *   The wave function is given as: ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5*i\n    *   The particle is only found in the region between x = 1 and x = 3.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Probability Density |ψ(x)|²:**\n    The probability density is the square of the magnitude of the complex wave function. For a complex number z = Re + i\\*Im, its magnitude squared is |z|² = Re² + Im².\n    *   The real part of the wave function is Re(ψ) = a / sqrt(1 + x).\n    *   The imaginary part of the wave function is Im(ψ) = -0.5.\n\n    Therefore, the probability density is:\n    |ψ(x)|² = [Re(ψ)]² + [Im(ψ)]²\n    |ψ(x)|² = [a / sqrt(1 + x)]² + (-0.5)²\n    |ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\n3.  **Set Up and Solve the Normalization Integral:**\n    We need to integrate the probability density from x = 1 to x = 3 and set the result equal to 1.\n    ∫ [from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1\n\n    We can split the integral into two parts:\n    ∫ [from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x)) dx + ∫ [from 1 to 3] 0.25 dx = 1\n\n    *   **Solving the first part:**\n        ∫ (a² / (1 + x)) dx = a² * ∫ (1 / (1 + x)) dx = a² * ln(1 + x)\n        Evaluating from 1 to 3:\n        a² * [ln(1 + 3) - ln(1 + 1)] = a² * [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² * ln(4/2) = a² * ln(2)\n\n    *   **Solving the second part:**\n        ∫ 0.25 dx = 0.25 * x\n        Evaluating from 1 to 3:\n        0.25 * (3 - 1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5\n\n4.  **Combine the Results and Solve for \"a\":**\n    Substitute the results of the integrals back into the normalization equation:\n    (a² * ln(2)) + 0.5 = 1\n\n    Now, we solve for 'a':\n    a² * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5\n    a² * ln(2) = 0.5\n    a² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n    a = sqrt(0.5 / ln(2))\n\n5.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    Using the value ln(2) ≈ 0.6931:\n    a = sqrt(0.5 / 0.6931) ≈ sqrt(0.7214) ≈ 0.8493\n\n    The calculated value of a is approximately 0.8493.
