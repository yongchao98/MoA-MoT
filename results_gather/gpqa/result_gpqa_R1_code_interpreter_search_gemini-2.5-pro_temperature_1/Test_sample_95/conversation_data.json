    "The user's question asks for the order of magnitude of the entropy of a supermassive black hole.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Understand the relationship between angular size, physical size, and distance.**\n    For a small angle `θ` (in radians), the relationship between the angular size, the physical diameter `D` of the object, and the distance `d` to the object is given by the formula:\n    `θ ≈ D / d`\n    The problem states the angular size of the event horizon. The diameter of the event horizon `D` is twice its radius, which is the Schwarzschild radius `R_s`. So, `D = 2 * R_s`.\n    Substituting this into the formula gives:\n    `θ = (2 * R_s) / d`\n    We can rearrange this to solve for the Schwarzschild radius:\n    `R_s = (θ * d) / 2`\n\n2.  **Convert the given values to standard SI units.**\n    *   Distance `d = 10^10` parsecs. We need to convert parsecs to meters.\n        1 parsec ≈ 3.086 × 10^16 meters.\n        `d = 10^10 * (3.086 × 10^16 m) = 3.086 × 10^26 m`.\n    *   Angular size `θ = 10^-17` degrees. We need to convert degrees to radians to use the small-angle formula.\n        180 degrees = π radians.\n        `θ = 10^-17 degrees * (π / 180) radians ≈ 1.745 × 10^-19 radians`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Schwarzschild radius (R_s).**\n    Now, plug the values in SI units into the formula for `R_s`:\n    `R_s = (1.745 × 10^-19 rad * 3.086 × 10^26 m) / 2`\n    `R_s ≈ (5.385 × 10^7 m) / 2 ≈ 2.693 × 10^7 m`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy (S).**\n    The entropy of a black hole is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula:\n    `S = (k_B * A) / (4 * l_P^2)`\n    where:\n    *   `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant (≈ 1.38 × 10^-23 J/K).\n    *   `A` is the surface area of the event horizon, which for a Schwarzschild black hole is `A = 4 * π * R_s^2`.\n    *   `l_P` is the Planck length, `l_P = sqrt((ħ * G) / c^3)`. Squaring this gives `l_P^2 = (ħ * G) / c^3`.\n        *   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (≈ 1.054 × 10^-34 J·s).\n        *   `G` is the gravitational constant (≈ 6.674 × 10^-11 m³·kg⁻¹·s⁻²).\n        *   `c` is the speed of light (≈ 3.00 × 10^8 m/s).\n\n    Substituting the expressions for `A` and `l_P^2` into the entropy formula simplifies it:\n    `S = (k_B * (4 * π * R_s^2)) / (4 * (ħ * G) / c^3)`\n    `S = (k_B * π * R_s^2 * c^3) / (ħ * G)`\n\n5.  **Compute the final value for entropy.**\n    Using the calculated `R_s` and the physical constants:\n    `S ≈ ( (1.38 × 10^-23) * π * (2.693 × 10^7)^2 * (3.00 × 10^8)^3 ) / ( (1.054 × 10^-34) * (6.674 × 10^-11) )`\n    `S ≈ ( (1.38e-23) * 3.1416 * (7.25e14) * (2.7e25) ) / ( 7.03e-45 )`\n    `S ≈ ( 8.48e17 ) / ( 7.03e-45 )`\n    `S ≈ 1.206 × 10^(17 - (-45)) J/K`\n    `S ≈ 1.206 × 10^62 J/K`\n\nThe calculation performed by the Python script confirms this result:\n`Code output: 1.20e+62`\n\nThe calculated entropy is approximately `1.20 × 10^62` J/K. The order of magnitude is 10^62.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) 10^62 J/K\nB) 10^65 J/K\nC) 10^66 J/K\nD) 10^59 J/K\n\nThe result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
