    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the information from the gas purification train.**\n    The mixture of gases formed from the decomposition of salts A and B is passed through three tubes. We can determine the composition of the gas mixture by analyzing the changes in each tube.\n\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2):** This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H2O). The mass of the tube increased by 3.60 g, which corresponds to the mass of H2O produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H2O = 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H2O = mass / molar mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)2 solution):** This solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases like CO2 or SO2. Since the weight of the tube did not change, we can conclude that no such acidic gases were formed during the decomposition.\n\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent and will react with oxidizing gases. The mass of the tube increased by 0.80 g. This increase is due to the mass of oxygen atoms that combined with the copper to form copper oxide (CuO).\n        *   Molar mass of oxygen atom (O) = 16.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) that reacted = mass / molar mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n        The oxidizing gas must have provided these 0.05 moles of oxygen atoms. Common oxidizing gases containing N and O are N2O or NO. The reaction with N2O is `Cu + N2O -> CuO + N2`. The reaction with O2 is `2Cu + O2 -> 2CuO`.\n\n    *   **Remaining Gas (C):** After all reactions, 2.24 L of a gas C remains. At standard temperature and pressure (STP), 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of gas C = Volume / Molar volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n        This gas C is inert to all the reagents, which strongly suggests it is dinitrogen (N2).\n\n2.  **Determine the elemental composition of the original salt mixture.**\n    The salts A and B decomposed completely into gases. By the law of conservation of mass, the total mass and elemental composition of the gaseous products must be the same as the initial 7.20 g salt mixture. The products contain hydrogen (from H2O), oxygen (from H2O and the oxidizing gas), and nitrogen (from the final gas C and possibly the oxidizing gas).\n\n    Let's find the total moles of each element in the gaseous products.\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in H2O. Moles of H = 2 * moles of H2O = 2 * 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is in H2O and the oxidizing gas. Moles of O = (moles of O in H2O) + (moles of O that reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n    *   **Nitrogen (N):** To find the moles of Nitrogen, we must first identify the oxidizing gas. Let's assume it's nitrous oxide (N2O), as this is a common decomposition product of ammonium salts.\n        *   Reaction in tube 3: `N2O + Cu -> CuO + N2`.\n        *   To provide 0.05 mol of O atoms, we must have started with 0.05 mol of N2O.\n        *   This reaction produces 0.05 mol of N2.\n        *   The total final N2 (gas C) is 0.10 mol. This means that in addition to the N2 produced from the N2O reaction, there must have been 0.05 mol of N2 in the initial gas mixture.\n        *   So, the original decomposition products were: 0.20 mol H2O, 0.05 mol N2O, and 0.05 mol N2.\n    *   Let's check the total mass of these products:\n        *   Mass = (0.20 mol * 18.0 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 44.0 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 28.0 g/mol)\n        *   Mass = 3.60 g + 2.20 g + 1.40 g = 7.20 g.\n        This matches the initial mass of the salt mixture, confirming our product identification.\n    *   Now, we can find the total moles of Nitrogen (N):\n        *   Moles of N = (2 * moles of N2O) + (2 * moles of N2) = (2 * 0.05) + (2 * 0.05) = 0.10 + 0.10 = 0.20 mol.\n\n3.  **Determine the combined formula of salts A and B.**\n    The initial 7.20 g mixture contained 0.40 mol of H, 0.20 mol of N, and 0.25 mol of O. The molar ratio of the elements is H : N : O = 0.40 : 0.20 : 0.25.\n    To get integer ratios, we can multiply by 20:\n    H : N : O = (0.40 * 20) : (0.20 * 20) : (0.25 * 20) = 8 : 4 : 5.\n    The empirical formula for the combined salts is H8N4O5.\n\n    The problem states we have an equimolar mixture of A and B. This means that the formula H8N4O5 represents the sum of the atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B.\n    Formula(A) + Formula(B) = H8N4O5.\n\n4.  **Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n    The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This is the total number of atoms in the combined formula H8N4O5.\n    *   Total atoms = (number of H atoms) + (number of N atoms) + (number of O atoms)\n    *   Total atoms = 8 + 4 + 5 = 17.\n\n*(Self-check: We can identify the salts A and B that fit this description. The decomposition products (N2, N2O, H2O) suggest ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\nSalt A: Ammonium nitrate, NH4NO3 (Formula: H4N2O3). Atoms = 4(H) + 2(N) + 3(O) = 9.\nSalt B: Ammonium nitrite, NH4NO2 (Formula: H4N2O2). Atoms = 4(H) + 2(N) + 2(O) = 8.\nCombined formula = H(4+4)N(2+2)O(3+2) = H8N4O5. This matches our derived formula.\nTotal atoms = Atoms(A) + Atoms(B) = 9 + 8 = 17. The result is consistent.)*\n\n<<<D>>>"
