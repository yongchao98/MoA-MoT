    "This problem involves the concept of time dilation in special relativity. The fast-decaying particles have a proper lifetime, let's call it `τ₀`. Because they are moving at relativistic speeds, their lifetime as observed in the laboratory frame (`τ_lab`) is dilated (lengthened) by the Lorentz factor `γ`.\n\nThe relationship is:\n`τ_lab = γ * τ₀`\n\nThe decay of these particles follows an exponential law. The number of particles `N(t)` remaining at a time `t` (in the lab frame) is given by:\n`N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / τ_lab)`\nwhere `N₀` is the initial number of particles.\n\nThe time it takes for a particle to travel from the center to the inner wall of the detector is `t_travel`. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`.\n`t_travel = R / v ≈ R / c`\nwhere `R` is the radius of the detector (30 m).\n\nThe fraction of particles `f` that reach the detector is the fraction that has not decayed by `t_travel`:\n`f = N(t_travel) / N₀ = exp(-t_travel / τ_lab)`\n\nSubstituting the expressions for `t_travel` and `τ_lab`:\n`f = exp(-(R / c) / (γ * τ₀))`\nThis can be rewritten as:\n`f = exp(-R / (γ * cτ₀))`\n\nThe term `cτ₀` represents the proper decay length of the particle, which is a constant for this type of particle. Let's call the constant term `C = R / (cτ₀)`. The equation becomes:\n`f = exp(-C / γ)`\n\nWe are given two scenarios.\n\n**Scenario 1:**\n*   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`\n*   Fraction reaching the detector, `f₁ = 1/3`\n\nPlugging these into our equation:\n`1/3 = exp(-C / 20)`\n\nTo solve for `C`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(1/3) = -C / 20`\n`-ln(3) = -C / 20`\n`C = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n*   Fraction reaching the detector, `f₂ = 2/3`\n*   We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`.\n\nUsing the same equation:\n`2/3 = exp(-C / γ₂)`\n\nTaking the natural logarithm:\n`ln(2/3) = -C / γ₂`\n`-ln(3/2) = -C / γ₂`\n`C = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\nNow we have two expressions for the constant `C`, so we can set them equal to each other:\n`20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\nSolving for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n`γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n\nNow, we can calculate the numerical value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# We derived the formula: gamma_2 = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)\ngamma_2 = 20 * math.log(3) / math.log(1.5)\n\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\nThe code will execute the final calculation.\n54.19083415172343\n\nThe calculated value for the new Lorentz factor `γ₂` is approximately 54.2. This is very close to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This problem requires understanding the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation, and how it applies to particle decay.\n\n**1. Set up the physical model:**\n\n*   **Particle Decay:** The decay of unstable particles is a random process that follows an exponential decay law. The fraction of particles, `f`, that survive after a time `t` in the laboratory frame is given by:\n    `f = N(t) / N₀ = exp(-t / τ_lab)`\n    where `N₀` is the initial number of particles, `N(t)` is the number remaining at time `t`, and `τ_lab` is the average lifetime of the particles as measured in the lab frame.\n\n*   **Time Dilation:** The lifetime of the particles in the lab frame (`τ_lab`) is longer than their lifetime in their own rest frame (the proper lifetime, `τ₀`) due to their high speed. This effect is called time dilation and is described by the equation:\n    `τ_lab = γ * τ₀`\n    where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n\n*   **Time of Flight:** The particles are created at the center of a spherical detector of radius `R = 30 m`. Since they travel at ultra-relativistic velocities, their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light, `c`. The time it takes for them to reach the detector wall is:\n    `t = R / v ≈ R / c`\n\n**2. Combine the equations:**\n\nWe can substitute the expressions for `τ_lab` and `t` into the decay equation:\n`f = exp(-(R / c) / (γ * τ₀))`\n\nLet's group the constant terms. For a given type of particle (`τ₀` is constant) and a given detector (`R` is constant), the term `R / (c * τ₀)` is a constant. Let's call this constant `K`.\n`K = R / (c * τ₀)`\n\nThe equation simplifies to:\n`f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n**3. Use the given information to solve for the unknown:**\n\nWe have two scenarios:\n\n*   **Scenario 1:**\n    *   Fraction surviving, `f₁ = 1/3`\n    *   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`\n    *   Plugging these values in: `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n\n*   **Scenario 2:**\n    *   Fraction surviving, `f₂ = 2/3`\n    *   Lorentz factor, `γ₂ = ?` (this is what we need to find)\n    *   Plugging these values in: `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n\nWe can solve for `K` from Scenario 1 by taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n`-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n`K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\nNow, we use this expression for `K` in the equation for Scenario 2. First, take the logarithm of the equation for Scenario 2:\n`ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`\n`γ₂ = -K / ln(2/3)`\n\nSubstitute the expression for `K`:\n`γ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / ln(2/3)`\n\nUsing the logarithm property `ln(a/b) = ln(a) - ln(b)` and `ln(a/b) = -ln(b/a)`:\n`γ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / -ln(3/2)`\n`γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n**4. Calculate the final value:**\n\nNow we compute the numerical value for `γ₂`.\n`ln(3) ≈ 1.0986`\n`ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`\n\n`γ₂ = 20 * 1.0986 / 0.4055 ≈ 54.19`\n\nThe calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2.\n\n**5. Conclusion:**\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 54\nB) 68\nC) 28\nD) 40\n\nThe value `54.19` is closest to **54**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
