    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculations for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.\n\n**1. Initial Conditions and Dilution**\n\n*   First, we calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted with water.\n*   Initial volume of acetic acid (V1) = 20.00 cm³\n*   Initial concentration of acetic acid (M1) = 0.05 M\n*   Final volume after adding 20.00 cm³ of water (V2) = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³\n*   Using the dilution formula M1V1 = M2V2:\n    *   (0.05 M) * (20.00 cm³) = M2 * (40.00 cm³)\n    *   M2 = (0.05 * 20.00) / 40.00 = 0.025 M\n*   So, the starting concentration of the acetic acid to be titrated is 0.025 M.\n*   Initial moles of acetic acid = Concentration × Volume = 0.025 mol/L * 0.040 L = 0.001 mol.\n\n**2. pH at 25% Titration**\n\n*   At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (CH3COOH) has reacted with NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH3COO-). This means 75% of the acetic acid remains.\n*   The solution now contains a mixture of a weak acid (CH3COOH) and its conjugate base (CH3COO-), which forms a buffer.\n*   We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH:\n    *   pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n    *   Where A⁻ is the conjugate base (acetate) and HA is the weak acid (acetic acid).\n*   First, calculate pKa from the given Ka:\n    *   Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n*   At 25% titration, the ratio of [A⁻]/[HA] is 25/75 = 1/3.\n*   Now, plug the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log(1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.73 - log(3)\n    *   pH = 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253\n\n**3. pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n*   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH, and the solution contains only the salt, sodium acetate (CH3COONa).\n*   The acetate ion (CH3COO⁻) is a weak base and will hydrolyze water, producing OH⁻ ions:\n    *   CH3COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH3COOH + OH⁻\n*   First, we need to find the concentration of the acetate ion at the equivalence point.\n    *   Moles of NaOH required to reach equivalence = Initial moles of CH3COOH = 0.001 mol.\n    *   Volume of 0.1 M NaOH added = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³.\n    *   Total volume of the solution = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n    *   Concentration of acetate [CH3COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n*   Next, we calculate Kb for the acetate ion using the relationship Kw = Ka × Kb (where Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25 °C).\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n*   Now, we can find the concentration of OH⁻ produced by the hydrolysis of acetate. We set up an equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis reaction:\n    *   Kb = [CH3COOH][OH⁻] / [CH3COO⁻]\n    *   5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n*   Since Kb is very small, we can approximate (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n    *   5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = x² / 0.02\n    *   x² = (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02 = 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n*   Finally, we calculate pOH and then pH:\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52\n\nLet's use a Python script to get more precise values.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\ninitial_conc_acid = 0.05\ninitial_vol_acid = 0.020\nvol_water = 0.020\nconc_NaOH = 0.1\n\n# 1. Dilution\nfinal_vol_acid_diluted = initial_vol_acid + vol_water\nfinal_conc_acid_diluted = (initial_conc_acid * initial_vol_acid) / final_vol_acid_diluted\ninitial_moles_acid = final_conc_acid_diluted * final_vol_acid_diluted\n\n# 2. pH at 25% titration\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\n# At 25% titration, [A-]/[HA] ratio is 25/75 = 1/3\npH_25 = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\n# 3. pH at equivalence point\n# Moles of NaOH added = initial moles of acid\nmoles_NaOH_eq = initial_moles_acid\n# Volume of NaOH added\nvol_NaOH_eq = moles_NaOH_eq / conc_NaOH\n# Total volume at equivalence point\ntotal_vol_eq = final_vol_acid_diluted + vol_NaOH_eq\n# Concentration of acetate (conjugate base)\nconc_acetate = initial_moles_acid / total_vol_eq\n# Calculate Kb\nKb = Kw / Ka\n# Calculate [OH-] concentration\n# Kb = [OH-]^2 / [Acetate]  => [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * [Acetate])\nOH_conc = math.sqrt(Kb * conc_acetate)\n# Calculate pOH and pH\npOH = -math.log10(OH_conc)\npH_eq = 14 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_25:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_eq:.2f}\")\n```\n>>>\npH at 25% titration: 4.26\npH at equivalence point: 8.52\n\nThe calculated pH values are approximately 4.26 at 25% titration and 8.52 at the equivalence point. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This problem requires calculating the pH at two different points during the titration of a weak acid (acetic acid) with a strong base (NaOH). First, we must account for the initial dilution of the acetic acid.\n\n**1. Initial Dilution**\n\n*   We start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid and dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water.\n*   The initial moles of acetic acid are: Moles = Concentration × Volume = 0.05 mol/L × 0.0200 L = 0.001 mol.\n*   The new total volume is 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.0400 L.\n*   The new concentration of acetic acid (which we will titrate) is: Concentration = Moles / Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0400 L = 0.025 M.\n\n**2. pH at 25% Titration**\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (CH₃COOH) has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), by the NaOH. This creates a buffer solution.\n\n*   The ratio of the conjugate base to the acid, [CH₃COO⁻]/[CH₃COOH], is 25/75 or 1/3.\n*   We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    pH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[acid])\n*   First, calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n*   Now, substitute the values into the equation:\n    pH = 4.73 + log(1/3)\n    pH = 4.73 - log(3)\n    pH = 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253\n*   So, the pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.\n\n**3. pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, and the solution contains only its conjugate base, sodium acetate. The acetate ion will hydrolyze water, making the solution basic.\n\n*   **Step A: Find the concentration of acetate.**\n    *   We need to determine the volume of 0.1 M NaOH required to neutralize 0.001 mol of acetic acid:\n        Volume = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³.\n    *   The total volume of the solution at the equivalence point is the initial diluted volume plus the volume of NaOH added:\n        Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L.\n    *   The concentration of the acetate ion is:\n        [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M.\n\n*   **Step B: Calculate the pH from the hydrolysis of acetate.**\n    *   The hydrolysis reaction is: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate:\n        Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰.\n    *   We set up an equilibrium expression to find the [OH⁻] concentration:\n        Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n        5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02)  *(We assume x is small compared to 0.02)*\n        x² = (5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 = 1.082 × 10⁻¹¹\n        x = [OH⁻] = √(1.082 × 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 × 10⁻⁶ M.\n    *   Now, calculate pOH and then pH:\n        pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.29 × 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n        pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52.\n*   So, the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\nThe calculated values are pH ≈ 4.26 at 25% titration and pH ≈ 8.52 at the equivalence point.\n\n<<<A>>>"
