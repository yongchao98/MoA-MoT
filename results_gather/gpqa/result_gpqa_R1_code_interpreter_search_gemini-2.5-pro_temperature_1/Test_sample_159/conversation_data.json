    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Aperture's Geometry as N approaches Infinity:**\n    *   The problem describes an aperture shaped like a regular N-sided polygon.\n    *   A key piece of information is that all apothems are of the same length, 'a'. The apothem is the perpendicular distance from the center of the polygon to one of its sides.\n    *   We need to consider the case where the number of sides, N, becomes infinitely large (N → ∞).\n    *   As N → ∞, a regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a' will smoothly transform into a circle. The apothem 'a' becomes the radius of this circle. Imagine increasing the number of sides of a hexagon, then an octagon, and so on, while keeping the distance from the center to the midpoint of each side constant. The polygon will increasingly resemble a circle with that constant distance as its radius.\n    *   Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n2.  **Recall Fraunhofer Diffraction by a Circular Aperture:**\n    *   When monochromatic light passes through a circular aperture, it produces a diffraction pattern in the far-field known as the Airy pattern. This pattern consists of a central bright spot (the Airy disk) surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings.\n    *   The angular positions of the dark rings (intensity minima) are determined by the zeros of the Bessel function of the first kind, of order one, J₁(x).\n    *   The condition for an intensity minimum is given by:\n        `k * a * sin(θ) = z_m`\n        where:\n        *   `k = 2π / λ` is the wave number of the light.\n        *   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n        *   `θ` is the angle of diffraction from the central axis.\n        *   `z_m` represents the m-th root (zero) of the Bessel function J₁(x), where x ≠ 0.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Angular Positions of the Minima:**\n    *   Substituting `k = 2π / λ` into the condition for minima:\n        `(2π / λ) * a * sin(θ_m) = z_m`\n    *   Rearranging to solve for `sin(θ_m)`:\n        `sin(θ_m) = (z_m * λ) / (2π * a)`\n    *   The problem states that we can use the small angle approximation, so `sin(θ) ≈ θ`.\n        `θ_m = (z_m * λ) / (2π * a)`\n\n4.  **Find the First Two Minima:**\n    *   To find the angular positions of the first two minima, we need the first two zeros of the J₁(x) Bessel function. These are well-known values:\n        *   First zero, `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n        *   Second zero, `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n    *   The angular position of the first minimum (`θ₁`) is:\n        `θ₁ = (z₁ / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ (3.8317 / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.610 * (λ / a)`\n    *   The angular position of the second minimum (`θ₂`) is:\n        `θ₂ = (z₂ / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ (7.0156 / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ 1.117 * (λ / a)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Angular Distance Between the First Two Minima:**\n    *   The question asks for the angular distance between these two minima, which is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n    *   `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = [(z₂ / (2π)) * (λ / a)] - [(z₁ / (2π)) * (λ / a)]`\n    *   `Δθ = ((z₂ - z₁) / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n    *   `Δθ = ((7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n    *   `Δθ = (3.1839 / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n    *   `Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * (λ / a)`\n\nTo get a more precise value, we can use a python script to calculate the coefficient `(z₂ - z₁) / (2π)`.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom scipy.special import jn_zeros\n\n# Get the first two positive zeros of the Bessel function of the first kind, order 1 (J1)\n# jn_zeros(nu, nt) computes the first nt positive real roots of the Bessel function J_nu(x).\nz1, z2 = jn_zeros(1, 2)\n\n# The angular distance is Delta_theta = ((z2 - z1) / (2*pi)) * (lambda / a)\n# We need to calculate the coefficient in front of (lambda / a)\ncoefficient = (z2 - z1) / (2 * math.pi)\n\nprint(f\"{coefficient:.3f}\")\n```\n<execute_output>\n0.507\n</execute_output>\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   The calculated coefficient is approximately 0.507.\n    *   Let's review the given options:\n        A) 0.610 λ / a (This is the position of the *first* minimum, not the separation)\n        B) 0.500 λ / a\n        C) 1.220 λ / a\n        D) 0.506 λ / a\n    *   The calculated value `0.507 λ / a` is extremely close to option D, `0.506 λ / a`. The minor difference is due to rounding in the option.\n\nTherefore, the angular distance between the first two minima is approximately 0.506 λ / a.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "An N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a' will become a circle of radius 'a' as the number of sides N approaches infinity. The problem, therefore, simplifies to finding the diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\nThe diffraction pattern from a circular aperture is known as the Airy pattern. The angular positions of the intensity minima (dark rings) are given by the formula:\n\n`sin(θ_m) = z_m * λ / (2 * π * a)`\n\nwhere:\n*   `θ_m` is the angular position of the m-th minimum.\n*   `λ` is the wavelength of the light.\n*   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n*   `z_m` is the m-th root (zero) of the Bessel function of the first kind, of order one, `J₁(x)`.\n\nThe problem states that we can use the small-angle approximation, so `sin(θ) ≈ θ`. The formula becomes:\n\n`θ_m = (z_m / (2 * π)) * (λ / a)`\n\nTo find the angular distance between the first two minima, we need to calculate `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = [(z₂ / (2 * π)) * (λ / a)] - [(z₁ / (2 * π)) * (λ / a)]`\n`Δθ = ((z₂ - z₁) / (2 * π)) * (λ / a)`\n\nWe need the values of the first two zeros of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`:\n*   First zero, `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n*   Second zero, `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\nNow, we can calculate the coefficient `(z₂ - z₁) / (2 * π)`:\n`Coefficient = (7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2 * 3.14159...)`\n`Coefficient = 3.1839 / 6.2832 ≈ 0.5067`\n\nThe python script execution confirms this calculation, giving a result of `0.507`.\n\nTherefore, the angular distance between the first two minima is:\n`Δθ ≈ 0.507 * (λ / a)`\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0.610 λ / a (This is the approximate position of the first minimum, `θ₁`)\nB) 0.500 λ / a\nC) 1.220 λ /a (This is the angular diameter of the central bright spot)\nD) 0.506 λ / a\n\nOur calculated value of `0.507 λ / a` is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
