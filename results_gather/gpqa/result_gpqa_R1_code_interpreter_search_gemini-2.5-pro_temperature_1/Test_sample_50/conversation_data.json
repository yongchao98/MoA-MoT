    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical System:** We have a point charge `q` placed at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is connected to a reservoir of charge (the Earth) and its electric potential is held constant at zero (V = 0).\n\n2.  **Method of Images:** This problem is a classic electrostatic problem that is most easily solved using the \"method of images.\" This method states that the electric field and potential *outside* the sphere can be accurately described by replacing the sphere with a fictitious \"image charge,\" `q'`, placed at a specific location *inside* the sphere. The combination of the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must satisfy the boundary condition that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero.\n\n3.  **Determine the Image Charge and its Location:** For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` and its position `d'` (measured from the center) are given by:\n    *   Image charge magnitude: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   Image charge position: `d' = R^2 / d`\n\n    The image charge has the opposite sign to the real charge, which is consistent with the fact that the sphere will attract the charge `q`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy:** The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from an infinite distance away to its final position at distance `d`.\n\n    A common mistake is to simply calculate the potential energy between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'` as `U = k * q * q' / (d - d')`. This is incorrect because the image charge is not a real charge, and its magnitude and position depend on the location of the real charge.\n\n    The correct way to calculate the energy is to consider the potential created at the location of the charge `q` by the *induced charges* on the sphere. By the method of images, this potential is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n\n    Let `V_induced` be the potential at the location of `q` (at distance `d`) due to the induced surface charge on the sphere. This is equal to the potential at `d` due to the image charge `q'`:\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (distance from q' to q)`\n    The distance between `q'` (at `d'`) and `q` (at `d`) is `d - d'`.\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (d - d')`\n\n    Substitute the expressions for `q'` and `d'`:\n    `V_induced = k * [-q(R/d)] / [d - (R^2/d)]`\n    `V_induced = -k * q * R / d / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\n    `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n5.  **The Factor of 1/2:** The total potential energy `U` of the system is given by `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`. The factor of 1/2 is crucial. It arises because the induced charge (and the potential it creates) is not constant but is built up as the charge `q` is brought in from infinity. The work done is an integral `âˆ« V dq`, which results in this factor of 1/2. Another way to see it is that the energy is stored in the interaction between the real charge and the induced charges, and for interaction energies, a factor of 1/2 prevents double-counting.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:**\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   A) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect.\n    *   B) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2) - **Correct.**\n    *   C) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2) - Incorrect.\n    *   D) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect.\n\nThe potential energy is negative, which is expected because the force between the charge and the grounded sphere is attractive.\n\n<<<B>>>"
