    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-).\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical species and their roles.**\n    The solution is prepared by dissolving potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na2HPO4●2H2O) in water.\n    *   KH2PO4 is a salt that dissociates completely in water to yield K+ ions and dihydrogen phosphate ions (H2PO4-). H2PO4- is a weak acid.\n    *   Na2HPO4●2H2O is a salt that dissociates completely in water to yield Na+ ions and hydrogen phosphate ions (HPO4^2-). HPO4^2- is the conjugate base of H2PO4-.\n    *   Therefore, the solution is a buffer composed of the conjugate acid-base pair H2PO4- / HPO4^2-.\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial molar concentrations of the buffer components.**\n    First, we need to find the number of moles of each component.\n    *   Volume of the solution (V) = 200.00 cm³ = 0.20000 L\n    *   Molar mass of KH2PO4 (Mw1) = 136.09 g/mol\n    *   Molar mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O (Mw2) = 177.99 g/mol\n\n    Now, calculate the moles:\n    *   Moles of KH2PO4 = Moles of H2PO4- = Mass / Mw1 = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007348 moles\n    *   Moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O = Moles of HPO4^2- = Mass / Mw2 = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005618 moles\n\n    Next, calculate the initial molar concentrations:\n    *   [H2PO4-] = Moles of H2PO4- / V = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L ≈ 0.03674 M\n    *   [HPO4^2-] = Moles of HPO4^2- / V = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L ≈ 0.02809 M\n\n3.  **Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] in the buffer solution.**\n    The buffer's pH is governed by the equilibrium involving the H2PO4- / HPO4^2- pair, which corresponds to the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (H3PO4):\n    H2PO4-  ⇌  H+ + HPO4^2-\n    The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka2 = 6.2x10^-8.\n\n    The expression for Ka2 is:\n    Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\n\n    We can rearrange this to solve for [H+]:\n    [H+] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-])\n    [H+] = (6.2x10^-8) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n    [H+] ≈ 8.11x10^-8 M\n\n4.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-].**\n    The orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-) is formed from the dissociation of the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO4^2-). This corresponds to the third dissociation of phosphoric acid:\n    HPO4^2-  ⇌  H+ + PO4^3-\n    The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka3 = 1.8x10^-12.\n\n    The expression for Ka3 is:\n    Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n\n    We can rearrange this to solve for the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, [PO4^3-]:\n    [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * ([HPO4^2-] / [H+])\n\n    Now, we plug in the values we have calculated. We assume that the equilibrium concentration of [HPO4^2-] is approximately its initial concentration (0.02809 M) because Ka3 is very small, meaning very little HPO4^2- dissociates.\n    [PO4^3-] = (1.8x10^-12) * (0.02809 M / 8.11x10^-8 M)\n    [PO4^3-] ≈ 6.24x10^-7 M\n\nLet's execute the calculations precisely using a script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nmass_kh2po4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_kh2po4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_na2hpo4_2h2o = 1.00  # g\nmw_na2hpo4_2h2o = 177.99  # g/mol\nvolume = 0.20000  # L\nka2 = 6.2e-8\nka3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 2: Calculate initial concentrations\nmoles_h2po4_minus = mass_kh2po4 / mw_kh2po4\nmoles_hpo4_2minus = mass_na2hpo4_2h2o / mw_na2hpo4_2h2o\n\nconc_h2po4_minus = moles_h2po4_minus / volume\nconc_hpo4_2minus = moles_hpo4_2minus / volume\n\n# Step 3: Calculate [H+]\n# [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-]/[HPO4^2-]\nconc_H_plus = ka2 * (conc_h2po4_minus / conc_hpo4_2minus)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate [PO4^3-]\n# [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]\nconc_po4_3minus = (ka3 * conc_hpo4_2minus) / conc_H_plus\n\nprint(f'{conc_po4_3minus:.2e}')\n```\n<execute_result>\n6.24e-07\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions is 6.24x10^-7 M.

The provided solution contains a detailed reasoning process, a python script for calculation, and the final answer derived from the script's output.\n\n**Detailed Breakdown of the Steps:**\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Buffer System:** The solution contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4●2H2O. These salts dissociate to form H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻ ions, respectively. This pair constitutes a phosphate buffer system (a weak acid H2PO4⁻ and its conjugate base HPO4²⁻).\n2.  **Calculate Molar Concentrations:**\n    *   Moles of H2PO4⁻ = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol.\n    *   Moles of HPO4²⁻ = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol.\n    *   Concentration [H2PO4⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M.\n    *   Concentration [HPO4²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M.\n3.  **Calculate [H⁺] using the Buffer Equilibrium (Ka2):**\n    *   The relevant equilibrium is H2PO4⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO4²⁻, governed by Ka2.\n    *   Ka2 = [H⁺][HPO4²⁻] / [H2PO4⁻]\n    *   [H⁺] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4⁻] / [HPO4²⁻]) = 6.2x10⁻⁸ * (0.03674 / 0.02809) ≈ 8.11x10⁻⁸ M.\n4.  **Calculate [PO4³⁻] using the Third Dissociation (Ka3):**\n    *   The formation of orthophosphate (PO4³⁻) is from the equilibrium HPO4²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO4³⁻, governed by Ka3.\n    *   Ka3 = [H⁺][PO4³⁻] / [HPO4²⁻]\n    *   [PO4³⁻] = Ka3 * ([HPO4²⁻] / [H⁺])\n    *   Plugging in the values: [PO4³⁻] = 1.8x10⁻¹² * (0.02809 / 8.11x10⁻⁸) ≈ 6.24x10⁻⁷ M.\n\nThe calculation performed by the Python script confirms this result precisely.\n\n`conc_po4_3minus = 6.24e-07`\n\nThis value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
