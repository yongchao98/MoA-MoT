    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Initial State:**\n    *   The particle is spin-1/2. Its magnetic moment `μ` is related to its spin `S` by the vector equation `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio. The problem statement `μ = γSz` is a common shorthand for the z-component `μz = γSz`.\n    *   Initially, there is a magnetic field `B` in the +Z direction. The particle's magnetic moment is aligned with this field. This means the spin is also aligned with the +Z direction, which minimizes the interaction energy `E = -μ · B`.\n    *   The state of a spin-1/2 particle aligned with the +Z axis is the \"spin-up\" eigenstate of the `Sz` operator, which we denote as `|+z>`. So, the initial state of the system at time `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n2.  **Identify the New Hamiltonian:**\n    *   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction, with the same magnitude `B`.\n    *   The new Hamiltonian `H` that governs the time evolution of the system for `t > 0` is given by the interaction energy with the new field:\n        `H = -μ · B = -γS · (B ĵ) = -γB Sy`\n        where `Sy` is the spin operator for the y-direction and `ĵ` is the unit vector in the y-direction.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Time Evolution (Larmor Precession Method):**\n    *   A classical magnetic moment `μ` in a magnetic field `B` experiences a torque `τ = μ × B`, which causes it to precess around the magnetic field direction.\n    *   The quantum mechanical analogue, described by the Ehrenfest theorem, is that the *expectation value* of the spin vector, `<S>`, precesses around the magnetic field `B`.\n    *   The equation of motion is `d<S>/dt = γ (<S> × B)`.\n    *   This equation describes precession around the vector `B` with an angular frequency `Ω`, known as the Larmor frequency, given by:\n        `Ω = γB`\n    *   In our problem, the initial spin expectation value is `<S(0)>`, which points in the +Z direction (since the state is `|+z>`, `<Sx(0)>=0`, `<Sy(0)>=0`, `<Sz(0)> = +ħ/2`).\n    *   The new magnetic field `B` points in the +Y direction.\n    *   Therefore, the spin vector `<S(t)>` will precess around the Y-axis in the XZ-plane, starting from the Z-axis.\n    *   The z-component of a vector precessing in the XZ-plane with angular frequency `Ω` is described by a cosine function:\n        `<Sz(t)> = <Sz(0)> * cos(Ωt) = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n    *   The average of the z-component of the magnetic moment is `<μz(t)> = γ<Sz(t)> = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n    *   This is an oscillation described by `cos(γBt)`. The angular frequency of this oscillation is the coefficient of `t`, which is `γB`.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Time Evolution (Quantum State Evolution Method):**\n    *   We need to solve the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. A standard way is to express the initial state in the basis of the new Hamiltonian's eigenstates.\n    *   The new Hamiltonian is `H = -γB Sy`. Its eigenstates are the eigenstates of `Sy`, which are `|+y>` and `|-y>`.\n    *   The initial state `|+z>` can be written as a superposition of these new eigenstates:\n        `|+z> = (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>)`\n    *   The time evolution of the state `|ψ(t)>` is given by applying the time evolution operator `exp(-iHt/ħ)`:\n        `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [ exp(-iE_+ t/ħ)|+y> + exp(-iE_- t/ħ)|-y> ]`\n        where `E_+` and `E_-` are the energy eigenvalues corresponding to `|+y>` and `|-y>`.\n    *   The eigenvalues of `Sy` are `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`. The energy eigenvalues are `E = -γB * (eigenvalue of Sy)`, so `E_+ = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E_- = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n    *   Substituting these into the state evolution equation:\n        `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [ exp(i γB t / 2) |+y> + exp(-i γB t / 2) |-y> ]`\n    *   To find the expectation value of `Sz`, we can transform this state back to the z-basis. Doing so (the detailed algebra is shown in the thought process) yields:\n        `|ψ(t)> = cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>`\n    *   Now we can calculate `<Sz>(t)`:\n        `<Sz>(t) = <ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)>`\n        `<Sz>(t) = (cos(γBt/2)<+z| - sin(γBt/2)<-z|) * Sz * (cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>)`\n        Using `Sz|+z> = (ħ/2)|+z>` and `Sz|-z> = -(ħ/2)|-z>`, this simplifies to:\n        `<Sz>(t) = (ħ/2) * [ cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2) ]`\n    *   Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`, we get:\n        `<Sz>(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n    *   Again, the expectation value of the z-component of the spin (and thus the magnetic moment) oscillates with an angular frequency of `γB`.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Both the semi-classical Larmor precession argument and the full quantum mechanical calculation show that the average of the z-component of the moment, `<μz>(t)>`, oscillates with an angular frequency of `γB`.\n\n    Comparing this result with the given options:\n    A) gamma*B\n    B) gamma*B/2\n    C) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n    D) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\n\n    The calculated frequency is `γB`, which matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
