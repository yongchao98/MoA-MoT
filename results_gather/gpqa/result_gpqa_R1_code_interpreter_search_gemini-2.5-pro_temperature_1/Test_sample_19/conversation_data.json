    "The user wants to identify the set of assumptions that define the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics.\n\nLet's break down the meaning of the impulse approximation and then evaluate each statement.\n\n**The Impulse Approximation**\n\nThe core idea of the impulse approximation is used to describe high-energy scattering from a bound system, like a nucleus. It assumes that the interaction between the incoming probe (e.g., an electron, neutrino) and a constituent of the target (a nucleon) happens so quickly that:\na) The interaction involves only a single nucleon. The other nucleons are \"spectators\".\nb) During the very short time of the interaction, the forces binding the struck nucleon to the rest of the nucleus can be ignored. The nucleon essentially behaves like a free particle at the moment of the collision.\nc) For the simplest version of this approximation (the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation or PWIA), it is also assumed that the incoming probe and the outgoing particles do not interact with the other \"spectator\" nucleons.\n\nNow let's evaluate the four statements based on this understanding:\n\n1.  **\"The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\"**\n    This is a core tenet of the impulse approximation. The total interaction is modeled as a sum of interactions with individual nucleons, ignoring more complex phenomena like meson-exchange currents where the probe interacts with the force-carrying particles between nucleons. This statement is **correct**.\n\n2.  **\"The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\"**\n    This means that the incoming probe reaches the target nucleon without being deflected or absorbed by other nucleons, and the outgoing particles (scattered probe and recoiling nucleon) leave the nucleus without any further interactions. These are known as initial-state interactions (ISI) and final-state interactions (FSI). Ignoring them is a key part of the simplest form of the impulse approximation (the PWIA). This makes the calculation tractable and is consistent with treating the nucleon as an isolated, free particle during the scattering event. This statement is **correct**.\n\n3.  **\"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\"**\n    This statement describes the internal structure of the nucleon itself. The impulse approximation, however, is a model for how a *nucleon* behaves within a *nucleus*. It treats the nucleon as a fundamental entity for the purposes of the calculation. The internal dynamics of the nucleon (which are, in fact, highly relativistic) are a separate area of physics and not a direct assumption of the impulse approximation. Therefore, this statement is **incorrect** in this context.\n\n4.  **\"The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.\"**\n    This is the \"impulse\" part of the name. The high energy of the interaction means the interaction time is extremely short. Over this short timescale, the relatively slow-acting nuclear binding forces do not have time to act. The nucleon's state is essentially \"frozen\" at the instant of the collision, and it recoils as if it were a free particle. This statement is **correct**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are statements 1, 2, and 4. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
