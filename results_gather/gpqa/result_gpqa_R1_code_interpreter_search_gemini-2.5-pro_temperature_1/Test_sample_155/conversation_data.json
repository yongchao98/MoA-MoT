    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the outcome of the reactions and the subsequent HPLC analysis.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. The molecule is symmetrical about the double bond, with a propyl group (CH3CH2CH2-) and a hydrogen atom attached to each carbon of the double bond.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs an epoxidation reaction on the alkene. Epoxidation is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to both carbons of the double bond from the same face. For a trans-alkene, this results in a trans-epoxide. Since the starting alkene is achiral, the attack of mCPBA can occur from the top face or the bottom face with equal probability, producing a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides: (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H3O+):** This reagent causes the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. The mechanism involves the protonation of the epoxide oxygen, followed by a backside (SN2-type) attack by a water molecule on one of the carbons of the epoxide. This backside attack results in an *anti*-dihydroxylation relative to the original alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The overall reaction is an *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene. There is a well-established stereochemical rule: the *anti*-addition to a **trans-alkene** (like (E)-oct-4-ene) results in a **meso** compound (if the alkene is symmetric).\n    *   The product of Reaction 1 is the meso compound, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. This is a single, achiral compound despite having two stereocenters.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene, also symmetrical.\n*   **Reagents:** The same as in Reaction 1 (mCPBA, followed by H3O+).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The overall reaction is again an *anti*-dihydroxylation. The stereochemical rule for this case is: the *anti*-addition to a **cis-alkene** (like (Z)-oct-4-ene) results in a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers (if the alkene is symmetric).\n    *   The products of Reaction 2 are (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other (enantiomers) and are formed in equal amounts.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the meso compound, let's call it **M**)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (one enantiomer from the racemic pair, let's call it **E1**)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the other enantiomer, let's call it **E2**)\n\nLet's examine the relationship between these isomers:\n*   **E1** and **E2** are enantiomers.\n*   **M** is a diastereomer of **E1**.\n*   **M** is also a diastereomer of **E2**.\n\n### Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms\n\n**1. Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n*   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers** (like E1 and E2) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore **cannot be separated**. They will elute at the same time and appear as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** (like M and E1, or M and E2) have different physical properties and **can be separated**.\n*   Therefore, the chromatogram will show two peaks:\n    *   **Peak 1:** The meso compound (M).\n    *   **Peak 2:** The co-eluting enantiomers (E1 + E2).\n*   **Result: 2 peaks.**\n\n**2. Chiral HPLC:**\n*   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment.\n*   In a chiral environment, enantiomers interact differently with the stationary phase and thus **can be separated**.\n*   Since all three compounds in the mixture (M, E1, and E2) are stereoisomers, they will all interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n    *   The meso compound (M) will have its own unique retention time.\n    *   The enantiomer E1 will have a different retention time.\n    *   The enantiomer E2 will have a retention time different from both M and E1.\n*   Therefore, the chromatogram will show three distinct peaks, one for each stereoisomer.\n*   **Result: 3 peaks.**\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Standard (achiral) HPLC will show **2 peaks**.\n*   Chiral HPLC will show **3 peaks**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\nLet me re-evaluate my step-by-step thinking.\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene (trans) + anti-addition -> meso product. Correct. One compound.\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene (cis) + anti-addition -> racemic product. Correct. Two enantiomers.\nMixture: One meso compound + one racemic pair (two enantiomers). Total of three stereoisomers. Correct.\nStandard HPLC: Separates diastereomers, not enantiomers. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. The two enantiomers are not separated from each other. So, one peak for the meso compound and one peak for the racemic pair. Total = 2 peaks. Correct.\nChiral HPLC: Separates all stereoisomers, including enantiomers. The three different stereoisomers (meso, R,R, and S,S) will all be resolved. Total = 3 peaks. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC. This matches option C.\n\nLet's check the options again.\nA) 4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC\nB) 3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC\nC) 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC\nD) 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC\n\nMy conclusion matches C. My previous text saying \"This corresponds to option B\" was a typo.\n\nFinal check of the reasoning.\n- Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA -> (rac)-trans-epoxide. Then H3O+ opens the epoxide via anti-attack. Trans-epoxide + anti-attack gives the meso-diol. Correct.\n- Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA -> meso-cis-epoxide. Then H3O+ opens the epoxide via anti-attack. Cis-epoxide + anti-attack gives the racemic-diol. Correct.\n- Mixture: (meso-diol) + (racemic-diol).\n- Standard HPLC of (meso-diol) + (racemic-diol): 2 peaks. Correct.\n- Chiral HPLC of (meso-diol) + (racemic-diol): 3 peaks. Correct.\n\nThe reasoning is solid. The answer is 2 peaks (standard) and 3 peaks (chiral).\n\n<<<C>>>"
