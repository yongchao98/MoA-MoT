    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Decipher the clues to identify Substance X, Y, W, G, and B.**\n\n*   **Clue 1: Gas W has an equal number of neutrons and protons.**\n    Let's examine potential simple gases formed in chemical reactions. We'll use the most common isotopes (e.g., ¹H, ¹²C, ¹⁴N, ¹⁶O, ¹⁹F).\n    *   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (No)\n    *   **D₂ (Deuterium gas, ²H₂):** 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (Yes)\n    *   N₂: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Yes)\n    *   CO: 6p+8p=14 protons, 6n+8n=14 neutrons. (Yes)\n    *   HF: 1p+9p=10 protons, 0n+10n=10 neutrons. (Yes)\n    The first clue, \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope\", strongly points towards Deuterium (D). Therefore, **Gas W is most likely D₂.**\n\n*   **Clue 2: The melting point of B is very close to 277 K.**\n    277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C. The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C. This is an excellent match.\n    Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O (heavy water).**\n\n*   **Clue 3: Precipitate G, when heated, releases B (D₂O).**\n    This is a classic dehydration reaction. G is likely a metal hydroxide which, upon heating, decomposes into a metal oxide and water. Since the product is D₂O, G must be a deuterated metal hydroxide (a metal deuteroxide), M(OD)ₙ.\n    Reaction: M(OD)ₙ --(heat)--> Metal Oxide + D₂O (B).\n\n*   **Clue 4: Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to release gas W (D₂) and form precipitate G (M(OD)ₙ).**\n    Since the products contain deuterium (D₂ and M(OD)ₙ), the reactants must provide the deuterium atoms. X is known to contain a heavy isotope (D), so the reaction must be X + Y -> D₂ + G. To produce D₂ gas and a deuteroxide precipitate, the liquid Y is almost certainly the deuterium source, **D₂O (heavy water)**, which is consistent with it being released from G upon heating.\n    So the reaction is: X + D₂O -> D₂ (gas) + G (precipitate).\n\n*   **Clue 5: Identifying Substance X.**\n    X reacts with D₂O to produce D₂ gas. This is characteristic of a powerful reducing agent, like a metal hydride or a complex metal hydride. The clue \"substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\" points towards common lab reagents. Let's test the most common ones: Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) and Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). The deuterated versions would be NaBD₄ and LiAlD₄.\n\n    *   If X = NaBD₄: The reaction with D₂O would be NaBD₄ + 4D₂O -> NaOD + B(OD)₃ + 4D₂. The products are sodium deuteroxide (soluble) and boric acid-d3 (soluble). No precipitate G would form. So, NaBD₄ is incorrect.\n    *   If X = LiAlD₄: The reaction with D₂O would be LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O -> LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂. Lithium deuteroxide (LiOD) is soluble, but Aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃) is a gelatinous precipitate, analogous to Al(OH)₃. This fits the description of precipitate G.\n\n*   **Clue 6: The keto acid reaction.**\n    This is the final confirmation. \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n    A keto acid has a ketone (C=O) group and a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group.\n    Substance X is LiAlD₄, a very strong reducing agent. Its non-deuterated analog, LiAlH₄, reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols.\n    *   Ketone (R-C(=O)-R') -> Secondary alcohol (R-CH(OH)-R')\n    *   Carboxylic acid (R-COOH) -> Primary alcohol (R-CH₂OH)\n    Applying this to a keto acid (R-C(=O)-COOH) with our substance X (LiAlD₄), both groups will be reduced:\n    R-C(=O)-COOH --(1. LiAlD₄ / 2. H₂O workup)--> R-CD(OH)-CD₂OH\n    The final product is a diol (a molecule with two alcohol groups). Let's count the oxygen atoms: R-CD(**O**H)-CD₂**O**H. There are indeed **2 oxygen atoms**. This confirms our identification.\n\n    Therefore, **Substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride, LiAlD₄.**\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the cumulative atomic masses.**\n\nThe question asks for \"the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\". The clause \"considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all... must be summed\" clarifies that we must sum the masses of all atoms of the relevant elements.\n\n1.  **Identify the elements in LiAlD₄:** The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H). The isotope of hydrogen is Deuterium (D or ²H).\n2.  **Identify the lightest and heaviest elements:**\n    *   By atomic number: H (Z=1), Li (Z=3), Al (Z=13). The lightest is Hydrogen, and the heaviest is Aluminum.\n3.  **Sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements.** We will use integer mass numbers for the isotopes involved:\n    *   The isotope of Hydrogen is Deuterium (²H), mass number = 2.\n    *   The stable isotope of Aluminum is ²⁷Al, mass number = 27.\n    *   The formula is LiAlD₄.\n4.  **Calculation:**\n    *   Total mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum): There is 1 atom of Al. Mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Total mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen): There are 4 atoms of D. Mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Cumulative sum = (Mass from Al) + (Mass from H) = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<A>>>"
