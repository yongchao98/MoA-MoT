    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Observations:**\n    *   **Observation 1: Â¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n        *   There are two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton.\n        *   These peaks are not due to spin-spin coupling.\n        *   The total integral for both peaks is 1H, and they have roughly equal individual integrals.\n        *   *Inference:* This means the alpha-proton exists in two different chemical environments. The sample is not a single, uniform compound but a mixture of two closely related species in a roughly 1:1 ratio.\n\n    *   **Observation 2: LC-MS Analysis:**\n        *   There are two distinct peaks in the liquid chromatogram (LC).\n        *   These peaks have equal intensities, corroborating the 1:1 ratio seen in the NMR.\n        *   *Inference:* The sample contains two compounds that have different interactions with the chromatography column, allowing them to be separated. This means they have different physical properties.\n        *   Both peaks give the exact same mass spectrum, and this mass corresponds to the expected product.\n        *   *Inference:* The two compounds are isomers of each other (same chemical formula, same mass), not a precursor or a side-product with a different molecular weight.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Options based on the Inferences:**\n\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n        *   Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) environment, they have identical physical and chemical properties.\n        *   This means they would produce identical NMR spectra (one set of peaks, not two) and would co-elute in a standard LC system (one peak, not two).\n        *   This option is inconsistent with both the NMR and LC data.\n\n    *   **B) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:**\n        *   A precursor is a different molecule used earlier in the synthesis. It would almost certainly have a different molecular formula and therefore a different mass.\n        *   The MS data shows both peaks have the *same* mass as the expected product.\n        *   This option is inconsistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n        *   Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images of each other. They have different physical properties and different arrangements of atoms in space.\n        *   Because they are distinct compounds with different properties, they can be separated by standard (achiral) LC, which explains the two LC peaks.\n        *   Because their atoms are arranged differently in space, corresponding protons (like the alpha-proton) will be in slightly different chemical environments, leading to different chemical shifts. This explains the two NMR peaks.\n        *   Because they are isomers, they have the same chemical formula and the same mass. This explains why both LC peaks give the identical, correct mass spectrum.\n        *   In the context of a peptide, this could arise from epimerization (e.g., an L-amino acid flipping to a D-amino acid during synthesis) or, very commonly, from restricted rotation around an amide bond, leading to stable *cis* and *trans* conformers. These conformers are a type of diastereomer known as atropisomers. This phenomenon perfectly matches all observations.\n\n    *   **D) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:**\n        *   This implies a side reaction where a molecule has reacted twice instead of once. This would create a new molecule with a different structure and a higher molecular weight.\n        *   This option is inconsistent with the mass spectrometry data, which shows the mass of the *expected* molecule for both peaks.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n    The only explanation that fits all the experimental evidence (two NMR peaks, two separable LC peaks, and identical mass for both peaks) is that the compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\n<<<C>>>"
