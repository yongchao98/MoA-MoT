    "This problem requires us to determine the final pH of a solution made by mixing a weak acid (CH3COOH), a strong acid (HCl), and a strong base (Ba(OH)2). The solution involves stoichiometry and acid-base neutralization reactions.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the initial moles of each species.**\n\n*   **Moles of Acetic Acid (CH3COOH):**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles = Volume × Molarity = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = 0.05 mol CH3COOH\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrochloric Acid (HCl):**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles = Volume × Molarity = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.08 mol HCl\n    *   Since HCl is a strong acid, it completely dissociates, providing 0.08 mol of H+ ions.\n\n*   **Moles of Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)2):**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles = Volume × Molarity = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2\n    *   Since Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, it completely dissociates: Ba(OH)2 → Ba2+ + 2OH-. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 produces two moles of OH- ions.\n    *   Moles of OH- = 2 × 0.09 mol = 0.18 mol OH-\n\n**Step 2: Neutralization of the strong acid and strong base.**\n\nThe H+ ions from the strong acid (HCl) will react with the OH- ions from the strong base (Ba(OH)2) first.\n\n*   Reaction: H+ + OH- → H2O\n*   Initial moles of H+ (from HCl) = 0.08 mol\n*   Initial moles of OH- (from Ba(OH)2) = 0.18 mol\n\nSince there are more moles of OH- than H+, the H+ ions will be completely consumed.\n*   Moles of OH- remaining = Initial moles of OH- - Moles of H+ reacted\n*   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.18 mol - 0.08 mol = 0.10 mol\n\n**Step 3: Reaction of the remaining strong base with the weak acid.**\n\nNow, the remaining OH- ions will react with the weak acid, CH3COOH.\n\n*   Reaction: CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O\n*   Initial moles of CH3COOH = 0.05 mol\n*   Moles of OH- available = 0.10 mol\n\nThe weak acid (CH3COOH) is the limiting reactant. It will be completely consumed by the excess OH-.\n*   Moles of OH- consumed = 0.05 mol\n*   Moles of OH- in excess = Moles of OH- available - Moles of OH- consumed\n*   Moles of OH- in excess = 0.10 mol - 0.05 mol = 0.05 mol\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final concentration of the excess OH- and determine the pH.**\n\nThe final solution contains 0.05 moles of excess OH- ions, which will determine the pH. The other species present (CH3COO-, Ba2+, Cl-) will not significantly affect the pH compared to the strong base.\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH-:**\n    *   [OH-] = Moles of excess OH- / Total Volume\n    *   [OH-] = 0.05 mol / 1.2 L = 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Calculate the pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log10([OH-])\n    *   pOH = -log10(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   The relationship between pH and pOH at 25°C is: pH + pOH = 14\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe pH of the final solution is 12.62.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Moles calculation\nmoles_ch3cooh = 0.500 * 0.1  # Weak acid\nmoles_hcl = 0.400 * 0.2      # Strong acid\nmoles_baoh2 = 0.300 * 0.3    # Strong base\n\nmoles_h_strong = moles_hcl\nmoles_oh_strong = 2 * moles_baoh2\n\n# Step 2: Neutralization of strong acid and strong base\nmoles_oh_after_strong_acid_reaction = moles_oh_strong - moles_h_strong\n\n# Step 3: Reaction of remaining strong base with weak acid\nmoles_oh_excess = moles_oh_after_strong_acid_reaction - moles_ch3cooh\n\n# Step 4: Calculate final concentration and pH\ntotal_volume = 0.500 + 0.400 + 0.300  # Total volume in L\nconc_oh_final = moles_oh_excess / total_volume\npoh = -math.log10(conc_oh_final)\nph = 14 - poh\n\nprint(f\"{ph:.2f}\")\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "To determine the pH of the final solution, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate the initial moles of the acid and base components.**\n    *   **Moles of CH3COOH (weak acid):**\n        *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n        *   Concentration = 0.1 M\n        *   Moles = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = 0.05 mol\n    *   **Moles of HCl (strong acid):**\n        *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n        *   Concentration = 0.2 M\n        *   Moles = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.08 mol\n        *   Since HCl is a strong acid, it completely dissociates, so moles of H+ = 0.08 mol.\n    *   **Moles of Ba(OH)2 (strong base):**\n        *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n        *   Concentration = 0.3 M\n        *   Moles = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol\n        *   Since Ba(OH)2 is a strong base that releases two hydroxide ions per formula unit (Ba(OH)2 → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻), the moles of OH⁻ are:\n        *   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.09 mol = 0.18 mol.\n\n2.  **Account for the neutralization reactions.** The strong base (OH⁻) will react first with the strong acid (H⁺), and then with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n    *   **Total moles of acid (H⁺ ions):** 0.08 mol (from HCl) + 0.05 mol (from CH3COOH) = 0.13 mol\n    *   **Total moles of base (OH⁻ ions):** 0.18 mol (from Ba(OH)2)\n\n3.  **Determine the excess reactant.**\n    *   Compare the total moles of base to the total moles of acid:\n        *   Moles of OH⁻ = 0.18 mol\n        *   Moles of acid (H⁺) = 0.13 mol\n    *   Since there are more moles of OH⁻ than H⁺, the base is in excess.\n    *   **Moles of excess OH⁻:** 0.18 mol - 0.13 mol = 0.05 mol\n\n4.  **Calculate the final concentration of the excess OH⁻.**\n    *   First, find the total volume of the final solution:\n        *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n    *   Now, calculate the concentration of the excess OH⁻:\n        *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n        *   [OH⁻] = 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n5.  **Calculate the pOH and then the pH.**\n    *   **pOH:**\n        *   pOH = -log[OH⁻]\n        *   pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n    *   **pH:**\n        *   pH + pOH = 14 (at 25°C)\n        *   pH = 14 - pOH\n        *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe pH of the final solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<B>>>"
