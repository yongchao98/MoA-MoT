    "An isotropic three-dimensional harmonic oscillator is described by the potential $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$, where $r^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$. The time-independent Schrödinger equation for this system can be separated in Cartesian coordinates, leading to three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillator problems.\n\nThe total energy $E$ is the sum of the energies of the three one-dimensional oscillators:\n$E = E_x + E_y + E_z$\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator are given by $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, ...$ is the quantum number for the $i$-th dimension ($i=x, y, z$).\n\nTherefore, the total energy of the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is:\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\nLet's define a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $n$ can take integer values $0, 1, 2, ...$. The energy levels can then be written as:\n$E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\nNow, we need to find the energy of the third excited state. The energy levels are determined by the value of $n$.\n1.  **Ground State:** This is the lowest energy level, corresponding to $n=0$.\n    $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n2.  **First Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=1$.\n    $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n3.  **Second Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=2$.\n    $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n4.  **Third Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=3$.\n    $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n\nSo, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$. This eliminates options A and D.\n\nNext, we need to find the degeneracy of this energy level. The degeneracy is the number of different combinations of the quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that result in the same total energy. For the third excited state, we need to find the number of ways to choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that their sum is $n = 3$.\n\nLet's list the possible combinations $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$:\n*   One quantum number is 3, the others are 0:\n    *   (3, 0, 0)\n    *   (0, 3, 0)\n    *   (0, 0, 3)\n    This gives 3 states.\n*   One quantum number is 2, one is 1, and one is 0:\n    *   (2, 1, 0)\n    *   (2, 0, 1)\n    *   (1, 2, 0)\n    *   (0, 2, 1)\n    *   (1, 0, 2)\n    *   (0, 1, 2)\n    This gives 6 states.\n*   All three quantum numbers are 1:\n    *   (1, 1, 1)\n    This gives 1 state.\n\nThe total number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy) is the sum of these possibilities:\nDegeneracy = 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.\n\nAlternatively, the degeneracy $g_n$ of the $n$-th energy level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is given by the formula:\n$g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\nFor the third excited state, $n=3$:\n$g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n\nThus, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$, and its degeneracy is 10. This corresponds to option B."
