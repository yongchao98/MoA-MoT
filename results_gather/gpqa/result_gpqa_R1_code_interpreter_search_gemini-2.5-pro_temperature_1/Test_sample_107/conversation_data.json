    "The user wants me to compare the magnitude of two energy values:\n1.  The paramagnetic coupling energy, $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle$.\n2.  The transition energy, $\\Delta E$, for a hydrogen atom.\n\nI will calculate both quantities and then compare their orders of magnitude.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Paramagnetic Coupling Energy $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle$\n\nThe Hamiltonian for the interaction of an atom's magnetic moment with an external magnetic field (Zeeman effect) is given by:\n$H = -\\vec{\\mu}_L \\cdot \\vec{B}$\nwhere $\\vec{\\mu}_L$ is the orbital magnetic dipole moment and $\\vec{B}$ is the magnetic field.\n\nThe orbital magnetic moment is related to the orbital angular momentum $\\vec{L}$ by:\n$\\vec{\\mu}_L = -\\frac{e}{2m_e}\\vec{L}$\nwhere $e$ is the elementary charge and $m_e$ is the electron mass.\n\nSubstituting this into the Hamiltonian gives:\n$H = \\frac{e}{2m_e}\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B}$\n\nThe magnetic field is parallel to the z-axis, so $\\vec{B} = B\\hat{z}$. The dot product becomes:\n$\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B} = L_z B$\n\nThus, the Hamiltonian is:\n$H = \\frac{e}{2m_e}L_z B$\n\nThe energy of this interaction is the expectation value of the Hamiltonian. The eigenvalues of the $L_z$ operator are $m\\hbar$, where $m$ is the magnetic quantum number. So, the energy levels are:\n$E_{Zeeman} = \\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle = \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e}mB$\n\nThe term $\\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e}$ is the Bohr magneton, denoted by $\\mu_B$.\n$\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle = \\mu_B m B$\n\nThe problem states that $B = 1$ T and $m$ has a \"small value\". To determine the order of magnitude, we can take a typical small, non-zero integer value for $m$, such as $m=1$.\n\nThe value of the Bohr magneton is:\n$\\mu_B \\approx 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV/T}$\n\nNow, we can calculate the energy:\n$\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle = (5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV/T}) \\times (1) \\times (1 \\, \\text{T}) = 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}$\n\nSo, the order of magnitude for the paramagnetic coupling term is approximately $10^{-5}$ eV.\nIn LaTeX format:\n```latex\n\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle = \\mu_B m B \\approx (5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV/T}) \\cdot 1 \\cdot (1 \\, \\text{T}) \\approx 5.8 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}\n```\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Transition Energy $\\Delta E$\n\nThe transition energy $\\Delta E$ corresponds to a photon with a given wavelength $\\lambda$. The relationship is given by the Planck-Einstein equation:\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$\nwhere $h$ is Planck's constant and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nThe given wavelength is $\\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m} = 486.1 \\, \\text{nm}$.\nA convenient formula for calculating energy in electron-volts (eV) from a wavelength in nanometers (nm) is:\n$\\Delta E (\\text{eV}) = \\frac{1240 \\, \\text{eV}\\cdot\\text{nm}}{\\lambda (\\text{nm})}$\n\nLet's calculate $\\Delta E$:\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{1240 \\, \\text{eV}\\cdot\\text{nm}}{486.1 \\, \\text{nm}} \\approx 2.55 \\, \\text{eV}$\n\nThe order of magnitude for the transition energy is approximately 1 eV. This specific wavelength corresponds to the Balmer series (H-beta line) in the hydrogen spectrum, which is a transition from the $n=4$ to the $n=2$ energy level.\nIn LaTeX format:\n```latex\n\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} = \\frac{1240 \\, \\text{eV}\\cdot\\text{nm}}{486.1 \\, \\text{nm}} \\approx 2.55 \\, \\text{eV}\n```\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Magnitudes\n\nNow we compare the two calculated energies:\n-   Paramagnetic coupling energy: $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle \\approx 5.8 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}$\n-   Transition energy: $\\Delta E \\approx 2.55 \\, \\text{eV}$\n\nLet's find the ratio:\n$\\frac{\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{5.8 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}}{2.55 \\, \\text{eV}} \\approx 2.3 \\times 10^{-5}$\n\nSince the ratio is extremely small ($ \\sim 10^{-5}$), it is clear that the paramagnetic coupling energy is very much smaller than the atomic transition energy.\n\n$\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle \\ll \\Delta E$\n\nThis result is expected, as the Zeeman effect (paramagnetic coupling) causes a very fine splitting of the main energy levels, and the energy shift is a small perturbation compared to the energy difference between principal electronic shells.\n\nFinal comparison:\n$5.8 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV} \\ll 2.55 \\, \\text{eV}$\n\nTherefore, the correct relationship is $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll\\Delta E$.\n\n<<<A>>>"
