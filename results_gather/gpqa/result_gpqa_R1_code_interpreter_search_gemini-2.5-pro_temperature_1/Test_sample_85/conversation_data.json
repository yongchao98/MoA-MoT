    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe product in both reactions is a stereoisomer of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered cyclic ester, also known as a delta-lactone. Let's analyze its structure and how it's formed.\n*   **Tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one:** A saturated six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom (position 1) and a carbonyl group (at position 2).\n*   **4-ethyl:** An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to position 4 of the ring.\n*   **Stereocenter:** The carbon at position 4 is chiral because it's attached to four different groups (H, ethyl, -CH2C(=O)O-, and -CH2CH2O-).\n*   **Formation:** Delta-lactones are formed by the intramolecular esterification of 5-hydroxycarboxylic acids. In this case, the precursor would be 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n\nLet's trace the atoms from the open-chain precursor to the cyclic product:\n`HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2(5)OH`\nThe hydroxyl group on C5 attacks the carboxylic acid group at C1 to form the six-membered ring.\n*   The stereocenter in the open-chain precursor is C3 (the carbon with the ethyl group).\n*   During cyclization, C3 of the acid becomes C4 of the lactone.\n*   Crucially, the reaction (cyclization) does not involve breaking any bonds at the stereocenter. Therefore, the stereochemical configuration (R/S) of the starting material is retained in the product.\n    *   An (R)-precursor will form an (R)-lactone.\n    *   An (S)-precursor will form an (S)-lactone.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Materials and Reagents**\n\nThe proposed starting material is `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This name describes a molecule with a five-carbon chain, a carboxylic acid at one end (C1), and an isobutyl ester at the other end (C5). The ethyl group is at C3.\n*   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-iBu`\n*   This molecule contains two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-COO-iBu). It also has the same stereocenter at C3 as the lactone precursor.\n\nThe two reactions use different reducing agents with known chemoselectivity:\n*   **LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride):** A mild reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH3 (Borane):** A reducing agent that selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The starting material A, which is an enantiomer of `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-iBu`, is treated with LiBH4.\n    2.  LiBH4 selectively reduces the ester group (`-COO-iBu`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`). The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) is left unchanged.\n    3.  This forms the intermediate 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid: `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`.\n    4.  The acidic workup (H+) catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the final lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As established, the configuration of the stereocenter is retained throughout the process. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** `A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The starting material B, the other enantiomer, is treated with BH3.\n    2.  BH3 selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`). The ester group (`-COO-iBu`) is left unchanged.\n    3.  This forms the intermediate isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate: `HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-iBu`.\n    4.  The acidic workup (H+) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (`iBuOH`) to form the same lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Again, the configuration of the stereocenter is retained. To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** `B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Starting material A is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material B is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
