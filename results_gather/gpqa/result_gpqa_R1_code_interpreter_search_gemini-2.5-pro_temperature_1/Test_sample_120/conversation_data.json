    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct product:\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This name describes a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused between carbons C1 and C6. There are methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4. The name also provides the absolute stereochemistry at these chiral centers.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi, known as lithium dimethylcuprate or a Gilman reagent. It is a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction is the nucleophilic opening of an epoxide ring by an organocuprate.\n\n**2. Apply the Rules of the Reaction**\nThe problem statement provides the key rules for this transformation:\n*   **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile (the methyl group from Me₂CuLi) attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n*   **Stereospecificity:** The attack proceeds via an Sₙ2 mechanism, which results in an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon atom that is attacked.\n\n**3. Determine the Site of Nucleophilic Attack**\n*   The epoxide ring is formed by carbons C1, C6, and the oxygen atom. The two carbons where the attack can occur are C1 and C6.\n*   We must compare the steric hindrance at these two positions:\n    *   **C1:** This carbon is bonded to the oxygen, C2, C6, and a methyl group. It is a **tertiary** carbon center (within the bicyclic system).\n    *   **C6:** This carbon is bonded to the oxygen, C1, C5, and a hydrogen atom. It is a **secondary** carbon center.\n*   A secondary carbon is significantly less sterically hindered than a tertiary carbon. Therefore, according to the rule, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack **C6**.\n\n**4. Determine the Constitution of the Product**\n*   When the methyl nucleophile attacks C6, the C6-O bond of the epoxide breaks.\n*   The oxygen atom remains attached to C1.\n*   A subsequent acidic workup (implied in this type of reaction) protonates the resulting alkoxide (O⁻) to form an alcohol (OH) group.\n*   Therefore, the final product will have:\n    *   An OH group at the position of the original C1.\n    *   The original methyl group at C1.\n    *   The original methyl group at C3.\n    *   The original methyl group at C4.\n    *   A **new** methyl group at C6.\n*   The product is a tetramethyl-substituted cyclohexanol. Let's determine its IUPAC name. The carbon bearing the OH group receives the lowest number, so the original C1 is the new C1. We then number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. The adjacent carbon (the original C6) has the newly added methyl group, so we number in that direction.\n    *   New C1 = Original C1 (has -OH and -Me)\n    *   New C2 = Original C6 (has new -Me)\n    *   New C3 = Original C5\n    *   New C4 = Original C4 (has -Me)\n    *   New C5 = Original C3 (has -Me)\n    *   New C6 = Original C2\n*   The substituents are at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. The base name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options A and D, which have a different substitution pattern.\n\n**5. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n*   The starting material has the absolute configuration: (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S).\n*   The reaction is an Sₙ2 attack at C6. This means the stereochemistry at C6 will be inverted.\n*   The stereocenters that are not directly involved in the reaction (C1, C3, C4) will retain their original configuration.\n*   Let's track the changes:\n    *   Configuration at C1 remains **R**.\n    *   Configuration at C3 remains **R**.\n    *   Configuration at C4 remains **R**.\n    *   Configuration at C6 inverts from **S** to **R**.\n*   Now, we map these configurations onto the newly numbered product:\n    *   Product C1 (from original C1) has the configuration **(1R)**.\n    *   Product C2 (from original C6) has the configuration **(2R)**.\n    *   Product C4 (from original C4) has the configuration **(4R)**.\n    *   Product C5 (from original C3) has the configuration **(5R)**.\n*   The full IUPAC name for the product, including stereochemistry, is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**6. Compare with Options**\n*   A) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect substitution pattern.\n*   B) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect stereochemistry at C2.\n*   C) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - **This matches our derived product perfectly.**\n*   D) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect substitution pattern and stereochemistry.\n\nThe final product is (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n<<<C>>>"
