    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the relationship between a density matrix and the Bloch vector.**\n\n    Any density matrix $\\rho$ for a single qubit can be represented by a point in the Bloch sphere using the following equation:\n    $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n\n    Where:\n    *   $I$ is the 2x2 identity matrix: $I = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    *   $\\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)$ is the Bloch vector, which represents the geometrical position of the state in the Bloch sphere.\n    *   $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$ is the vector of Pauli matrices:\n        *   $\\sigma_x = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n        *   $\\sigma_y = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n        *   $\\sigma_z = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n2.  **Express the given density matrix in matrix form.**\n\n    The problem gives the density matrix as:\n    $\\rho=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|\\right)$\n\n    In the standard computational basis, the kets and bras are:\n    *   $|0\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, $\\langle 0| = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   $|1\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, $\\langle 1| = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    From these, we can calculate the outer products:\n    *   $|0\\rangle \\langle 0| = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   $|1\\rangle \\langle 1| = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    Now, substitute these back into the expression for $\\rho$:\n    $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{2}I$\n\n3.  **Determine the Bloch vector `r`.**\n\n    We have found that the given density matrix is $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$. Now we compare this with the general form $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$.\n\n    $\\frac{1}{2}I = \\frac{1}{2}(I + r_x \\sigma_x + r_y \\sigma_y + r_z \\sigma_z)$\n\n    Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:\n    $I = I + r_x \\sigma_x + r_y \\sigma_y + r_z \\sigma_z$\n\n    Subtracting $I$ from both sides gives:\n    $0 = r_x \\sigma_x + r_y \\sigma_y + r_z \\sigma_z$\n\n    Since the Pauli matrices are linearly independent, the only way for this equation to be true is if all the coefficients are zero:\n    $r_x = 0$\n    $r_y = 0$\n    $r_z = 0$\n\n    Therefore, the Bloch vector is $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**\n\n    The geometrical position of the density matrix $\\rho=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|\\right)$ in the qubit space is the origin of the Bloch sphere, represented by the vector r=(0,0,0). This state is known as the maximally mixed state.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) r=(1,1,0)\nB) r=(1,1,1)\nC) r=(0,0,1)\nD) r=(0,0,0)\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
