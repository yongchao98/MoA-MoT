    "This problem requires a systematic analysis of spectroscopic data (FTIR, 1H NMR, Mass Spectrometry) to deduce the correct molecular formula from a given list.\n\n**1. Analysis of FTIR Spectrum:**\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a hallmark of an O-H stretching vibration, and its broadness is characteristic of hydrogen bonding. This strongly suggests the presence of either an alcohol (-OH) or a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group. Carboxylic acid O-H stretches are typically very broad.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, it aligns well with the C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid (around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound very likely contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a C=C double bond. The presence of the -COOH group implies the presence of two oxygen atoms.\n\n**2. Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation confirms the presence of a C=C double bond, which supports the conclusion from the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak in the FTIR spectrum.\n\n**3. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a key piece of evidence. We need to identify a common fragment with this mass-to-charge ratio. The most common and stable fragment with m/z = 45 is the carboxylium ion, [COOH]⁺. Its mass is calculated as: 12.01 (C) + 2 * 16.00 (O) + 1.01 (H) ≈ 45. This fragment is very characteristic of carboxylic acids.\n\n**4. Integrating the Evidence and Determining the Formula:**\n\n*   From the data, we have established the presence of two functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and a C=C double bond.\n*   The carboxylic acid group contains two oxygen atoms. This immediately eliminates the formulas C6H12O and C6H10O, which only have one oxygen atom. We are left with C6H10O2 and C6H12O2.\n*   Now, we must use the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to differentiate between the remaining two options. The DoU represents the number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule.\n    *   A C=O double bond contributes 1 to the DoU.\n    *   A C=C double bond contributes 1 to the DoU.\n    *   Therefore, our molecule must have a total DoU of at least 2.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for the remaining formulas using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **For C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1. This formula corresponds to a molecule with only one degree of unsaturation (e.g., a saturated carboxylic acid like hexanoic acid). It cannot have both a C=O and a C=C bond. This contradicts our findings.\n*   **For C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2. This formula corresponds to a molecule with two degrees of unsaturation. This perfectly accommodates one C=O bond (from the carboxylic acid) and one C=C bond (from the vinyl group).\n\n**Final Conclusion:** The compound has a carboxylic acid group and a C=C double bond. This requires two oxygen atoms and a degree of unsaturation of 2. Only the formula C6H10O2 satisfies all these conditions. An example of such a compound would be 2-hexenoic acid.\n\n<<<A>>>"
