    "**1. Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n*   **Step 1: Identify the structure of the starting compound (C8H9NO) from the NMR data.**\n\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for DoU is C - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 + 1.\n        DoU = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n        A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 units of unsaturation) and one additional double bond or ring. The signals in the aromatic region (6-8 ppm) confirm the benzene ring. The extra unit of unsaturation is likely a carbonyl group (C=O), as suggested by the very downfield aldehyde proton.\n\n    *   **Analysis of 1H-NMR Data:**\n        *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The multiplicity is a triplet (t), which means it's coupled to an adjacent group with 2 protons (n+1=3, so n=2), i.e., a CH2 group. This confirms a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n        *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the CH2 group adjacent to the aldehyde. Its multiplicity is a doublet (d), meaning it's coupled to the single aldehyde proton (n+1=2, so n=1). The chemical shift of ~3.6 ppm is consistent with a methylene group attached to both a benzene ring and a carbonyl group (benzylic and α to carbonyl).\n        *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons and appearing as doublets, are a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n        *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet (bs) that integrates to 2 protons is indicative of an amine group (-NH2) or a hydroxyl group (-OH). Given the nitrogen in the molecular formula, this is an -NH2 group.\n\n    *   **Assembling the Structure:**\n        We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The substituents are an -NH2 group and a -CH2CHO group.\n        The structure is therefore **2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde**.\n        Let's verify this structure against the data:\n        - Formula: C6H4 (ring) + CH2 + CHO + NH2 = C8H9NO. (Correct)\n        - NMR: The electron-donating -NH2 group shields the ortho protons (making them appear upfield, ~6.51 ppm), while the weakly electron-withdrawing -CH2CHO group results in the other aromatic protons appearing more downfield (~6.98 ppm). The -CH2CHO fragment protons match the observed coupling (d and t). The -NH2 protons appear as a broad singlet. The structure is fully consistent with all the provided data.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the sequence of reactions.**\n\n    *   **Starting Material:** 2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde.\n\n    *   **Reaction 1: NaNO2 + HCl (Diazotization)**\n        This reagent mixture, typically used at low temperatures (0-5 °C), converts a primary aromatic amine into a diazonium salt.\n        The -NH2 group on the benzene ring is transformed into a diazonium group (-N2+Cl-).\n        **Intermediate A:** 2-(4-diazoniumphenyl)acetaldehyde chloride.\n\n    *   **Reaction 2: H2O (Hydrolysis)**\n        Aqueous diazonium salts are generally unstable. Upon warming, they react with water to replace the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group, liberating nitrogen gas (N2).\n        **Intermediate B:** 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde.\n\n    *   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation)**\n        We now have an aldehyde (2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde) in the presence of a strong base (KOH) and heat. These are the conditions for an aldol condensation reaction.\n        The aldehyde has acidic protons on the carbon alpha to the carbonyl group (the -CH2- group).\n        1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH removes an acidic α-proton from one molecule of the aldehyde to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n        2.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of the aldehyde. This forms an alkoxide intermediate, which is then protonated by water to give the aldol addition product.\n        3.  **Aldol Addition Product:** The structure of this initial product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This corresponds to option (C).\n        4.  **Dehydration:** The reaction mixture is heated. Heat provides the energy to eliminate a molecule of water from the aldol addition product. The acidic proton on the α-carbon (C2) and the hydroxyl group on the β-carbon (C3) are removed. This forms a double bond between C2 and C3.\n        5.  **Final Product:** The elimination of water results in the formation of an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde: **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This is a highly stable conjugated system (the double bond is conjugated with the carbonyl group and one of the phenyl rings), so its formation is strongly favored under heat. This structure corresponds to option (B).\n\n*   **Step 3: Conclusion**\n\n    The question asks for the final product of the entire reaction sequence. The aldol reaction under heat proceeds through the addition product (structure C) to the final, more stable dehydrated condensation product (structure B). Therefore, 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal is the final product.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect stoichiometry; this product contains only one phenyl ring, whereas the self-condensation uses two molecules of the starting aldehyde.\n    *   B) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: This is the final product of the aldol condensation (dehydration of the aldol adduct). This is the most likely answer.\n    *   C) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the intermediate aldol addition product, formed before the heat-induced dehydration step. It is not the final product.\n    *   D) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect substituents; the -NH2 group was converted to an -OH group, so the final product should have hydroxyphenyl rings, not phenyl rings.\n\nThus, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<B>>>"
