    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2 (T_eq4 / T_eq2).\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of an exoplanet is determined by the energy it receives from its host star. The formula is:\n    T_eq⁴ ∝ L_star * (1 - A) / a²\n    where:\n    *   L_star is the luminosity of the star.\n    *   A is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n    Taking the fourth root of both sides, we get:\n    T_eq ∝ ( (1 - A) / a² )^(1/4)\n    T_eq ∝ (1 - A)^(1/4) * a^(-1/2)\n\n3.  **Formulate the Temperature Ratio:** We want to find the ratio T_eq4 / T_eq2.\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = [ (1 - A4)^(1/4) * a4^(-1/2) ] / [ (1 - A2)^(1/4) * a2^(-1/2) ]\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio using Given Information:**\n    *   Both planets orbit the same star, so the star's properties are constant.\n    *   The problem states that the planets have the same albedo (A4 = A2). Therefore, the (1 - A)^(1/4) term cancels out.\n    *   The formula simplifies to:\n        T_eq4 / T_eq2 = a4^(-1/2) / a2^(-1/2) = (a2 / a4)^(1/2)\n\n5.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis (a) to Orbital Period (P):** We are given the ratio of orbital periods, not the semi-major axes. We can use Kepler's Third Law to connect these two quantities. For planets orbiting the same star, the law states:\n    P² ∝ a³\n    This implies:\n    a ∝ P^(2/3)\n\n6.  **Substitute the Period-Axis Relationship into the Temperature Ratio:** Now, substitute `a ∝ P^(2/3)` into our simplified temperature ratio equation:\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = ( [k * P2^(2/3)] / [k * P4^(2/3)] )^(1/2)\n    where `k` is the constant of proportionality, which cancels out.\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = ( (P2 / P4)^(2/3) )^(1/2)\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P2 / P4)^((2/3) * (1/2))\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P2 / P4)^(1/3)\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Value:** The problem gives the ratio of orbital periods as P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\n    *   The ratio value for P2 is 2.\n    *   The ratio value for P4 is 3.5.\n\n    Substitute these values into the final equation:\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\n\n    To compute this, we can use a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\n# Ratio of the orbital periods of Planet 2 to Planet 4\nperiod_ratio = 2 / 3.5\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures is the cube root of the period ratio.\ntemperature_ratio = period_ratio**(1/3)\n\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\n```output\n0.829918731110323\n```\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.83.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~0.69\nB) ~0.75\nC) ~0.57\nD) ~0.83\n\nThe result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The equilibrium temperature T_eq of a planet is given by the formula:\nT_eq = [L(1 - A) / (16 * π * σ * a²)]^(1/4)\nwhere L is the star's luminosity, A is the planet's albedo, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and a is the semi-major axis of the orbit.\n\nFor two planets orbiting the same star, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures is:\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = {[L(1 - A4) / (16 * π * σ * a4²)]^(1/4)} / {[L(1 - A2) / (16 * π * σ * a2²)]^(1/4)}\n\nGiven that the albedos are the same (A4 = A2) and they orbit the same star (L is constant), the formula simplifies to:\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (a2² / a4²)^(1/4) = (a2 / a4)^(1/2)\n\nNow we need to relate the semi-major axis (a) to the orbital period (P). According to Kepler's Third Law for planets orbiting the same star:\nP² ∝ a³\nThis implies:\na ∝ P^(2/3)\n\nSubstituting this relationship into our temperature ratio equation:\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = [ (P2^(2/3)) / (P4^(2/3)) ]^(1/2)\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P2 / P4)^((2/3) * (1/2))\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P2 / P4)^(1/3)\n\nWe are given the ratio of the orbital periods P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\nSo, P2 = 2 and P4 = 3.5 in this ratio.\n\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\n\nLet's calculate the value:\n(2 / 3.5) ≈ 0.5714\n(0.5714)^(1/3) ≈ 0.8299\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.83. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
