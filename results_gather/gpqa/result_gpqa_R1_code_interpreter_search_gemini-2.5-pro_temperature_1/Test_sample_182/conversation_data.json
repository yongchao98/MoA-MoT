    "**1. Analyze the Reactant**\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down its structure to understand its components and calculate its initial index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD).\n\n*   **Cyclohex-3-ene**: This is a six-membered ring containing one carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   A ring contributes 1 to the IHD.\n    *   The double bond (C=C) contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **Carboxylic acid (-COOH)**: This functional group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n    *   This double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **Formyl (-CHO)**: This is an aldehyde group, which also contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n    *   This double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **Vinyl (-CH=CH2)**: This substituent contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n    *   This double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n\n**Initial IHD of the reactant:**\nSumming up all contributions:\nIHD = (1 for the ring) + (1 for the C=C in the ring) + (1 for the C=O in carboxylic acid) + (1 for the C=O in the formyl group) + (1 for the C=C in the vinyl group) = **5**.\n\nAlternatively, we can determine the molecular formula and calculate the IHD from it.\n*   The structure is C6H5(COOH)(CHO)(C2H3).\n*   Carbons (C): 6 (ring) + 1 (acid) + 1 (aldehyde) + 2 (vinyl) = 10\n*   Hydrogens (H): Let's count them on the structure `C1(-COOH)-C2(-CHO)-C3H=C4H-C5H(-CH=CH2)-C6H2-`.\n    *   H on ring carbons: 1(on C1) + 1(on C2) + 1(on C3) + 1(on C4) + 1(on C5) + 2(on C6) = 7 H.\n    *   H on functional groups: 1(in COOH) + 1(in CHO) + 3(in vinyl) = 5 H.\n    *   Total H = 7 + 5 = 12.\n*   Oxygens (O): 2 (in COOH) + 1 (in CHO) = 3.\n*   Molecular formula of reactant: **C10H12O3**.\n\nNow, calculate IHD using the formula `IHD = C + 1 - H/2`:\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 11 - 6 = **5**. This confirms our structural analysis.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\nThe reagent used is **red phosphorus and an excess of HI (Red P + HI)**. This is a very strong reducing agent. Its effect is to reduce nearly all oxygen-containing functional groups and unsaturations (double/triple bonds) to their corresponding saturated alkane forms.\n\n*   **Alkene reduction**: All C=C bonds will be reduced to C-C single bonds.\n*   **Carbonyl reduction**: Both the aldehyde (-CHO) and carboxylic acid (-COOH) groups will be fully reduced to methyl (-CH3) groups.\n*   **Ring stability**: The cyclohexane ring itself is stable and will not be opened under these conditions.\n\n**3. Determine the Product**\n\nThe reaction will proceed as follows:\n*   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring.\n*   The `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) at position 1 becomes a `methyl` group (-CH3).\n*   The `formyl` group (-CHO) at position 2 becomes a `methyl` group (-CH3).\n*   The `vinyl` group (-CH=CH2) at position 5 becomes an `ethyl` group (-CH2CH3).\n\nThe resulting product is a substituted cyclohexane (specifically, 4-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane, though the exact IUPAC name is not required). The key takeaway is that the product is a **saturated cycloalkane**. It contains a single ring but has no double or triple bonds.\n\n**4. Calculate the IHD of the Product**\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) is the sum of the number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n\n*   **Rings**: The product has one cyclohexane ring. Contribution = 1.\n*   **Pi bonds**: The product is fully saturated, meaning it has no double or triple bonds. Contribution = 0.\n\n**Final IHD of the product = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = 1.**\n\nAlternatively, we can determine the molecular formula of the product. The carbon skeleton is conserved (C=10). The product is a saturated monocyclic alkane, so its general formula is CnH2n.\n*   Molecular formula of the product: **C10H20**.\n\nNow, calculate IHD using the formula:\nIHD = C + 1 - H/2 = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 11 - 10 = **1**.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<A>>>"
