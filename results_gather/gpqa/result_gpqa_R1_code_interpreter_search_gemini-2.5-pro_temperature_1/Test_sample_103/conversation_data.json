    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Observables:** The problem provides the periodic wavelength shifts (Δλ) for two stars, which are caused by the gravitational pull of their orbiting planets. This is the basis of the Radial Velocity (RV) method.\n    *   For planet #1, Δλ₁ = 5 milliangstroms.\n    *   For planet #2, Δλ₂ = 7 milliangstroms.\n\n2.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Stellar Velocity:** The Doppler effect equation relates the wavelength shift (Δλ) to the radial velocity of the star (v_star) along the line of sight:\n    Δλ / λ₀ = v_star / c\n    where λ₀ is the rest wavelength and c is the speed of light.\n    The problem refers to the \"up to\" shift, which means we are dealing with the amplitude of the periodic shift. This corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star, denoted as K_star.\n    Therefore, the amplitude of the stellar radial velocity is directly proportional to the amplitude of the wavelength shift:\n    K_star ∝ Δλ\n    This allows us to find the ratio of the stellar velocity amplitudes for the two systems:\n    K_star₂ / K_star₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 / 5\n\n3.  **Relate Stellar Velocity to Orbital Parameters:** The formula for the stellar radial velocity semi-amplitude (K_star) for a planet in a circular orbit is derived from the conservation of momentum and Kepler's Third Law. Assuming the planet's mass (m_p) is much smaller than the star's mass (M_star), the simplified formula is:\n    K_star ≈ (2πG)^(1/3) * (m_p / M_star^(2/3)) * P^(-1/3)\n    where G is the gravitational constant and P is the orbital period.\n\n4.  **Compare the Two Systems:** We are given that:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: M_star₁ = M_star₂.\n    *   The planets have similar masses: m_p₁ ≈ m_p₂.\n    *   The orbits are circular.\n    When we take the ratio of K_star₂ to K_star₁, all the constant terms, as well as m_p and M_star, cancel out:\n    K_star₂ / K_star₁ = [ (2πG)^(1/3) * (m_p₂ / M_star₂^(2/3)) * P₂^(-1/3) ] / [ (2πG)^(1/3) * (m_p₁ / M_star₁^(2/3)) * P₁^(-1/3) ]\n    K_star₂ / K_star₁ = P₂^(-1/3) / P₁^(-1/3)\n    K_star₂ / K_star₁ = (P₂ / P₁)^(-1/3)\n\n5.  **Solve for the Period Ratio (P₂ / P₁):** Now we can substitute the known ratio of the stellar velocities:\n    7 / 5 = (P₂ / P₁)^(-1/3)\n    To solve for P₂/P₁, we can raise both sides to the power of -3:\n    (7 / 5)^(-3) = [ (P₂ / P₁)^(-1/3) ]^(-3)\n    (5 / 7)³ = P₂ / P₁\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Value:** The final step is to compute the value of (5/7)³.\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio (5/7)^3\nratio = (5/7)**3\nprint(ratio)\n```\n<execute_code>\n0.36443249371820804\n</execute_code>\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.364. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 1.40\nB) ~ 1.96\nC) ~ 0.36\nD) ~ 0.85\n\nThe result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Stellar Velocity:** The periodic shift in a spectral line is due to the Doppler effect, caused by the star's motion as it orbits the common center of mass with its planet. The amplitude of the radial velocity of the star (K_star) is directly proportional to the amplitude of the wavelength shift (Δλ).\n    *   K_star ∝ Δλ\n    *   Therefore, the ratio of the stellar velocity amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the wavelength shifts:\n        K_star₂ / K_star₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 milliangstroms / 5 milliangstroms = 7/5\n\n2.  **Relate Stellar Velocity to Orbital Parameters:** The semi-amplitude of the stellar radial velocity (K_star) for a planet in a circular orbit, assuming the planet's mass (m_p) is much smaller than the star's mass (M_star), is given by the formula:\n    *   K_star ≈ (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p / M_star^(2/3))\n    *   Where G is the gravitational constant and P is the orbital period.\n\n3.  **Set up the Ratio for the Two Systems:** We can write the formula for each star-planet system and then take their ratio:\n    *   K_star₁ = (2πG / P₁)^(1/3) * (m_p₁ / M_star₁^(2/3))\n    *   K_star₂ = (2πG / P₂)^(1/3) * (m_p₂ / M_star₂^(2/3))\n    *   Dividing the second equation by the first gives:\n        K_star₂ / K_star₁ = [ (2πG / P₂)^(1/3) * (m_p₂ / M_star₂^(2/3)) ] / [ (2πG / P₁)^(1/3) * (m_p₁ / M_star₁^(2/3)) ]\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:** The problem states that the star masses are the same (M_star₁ = M_star₂) and the planet masses are similar (m_p₁ ≈ m_p₂). The term (2πG) is a constant. Therefore, these terms cancel out in the ratio:\n    *   K_star₂ / K_star₁ = (1 / P₂)^(1/3) / (1 / P₁)^(1/3)\n    *   K_star₂ / K_star₁ = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n    *   This can also be written as: K_star₂ / K_star₁ = (P₂ / P₁)^(-1/3)\n\n5.  **Solve for the Period Ratio (P₂ / P₁):** Now, substitute the known velocity ratio into the simplified equation:\n    *   7 / 5 = (P₂ / P₁)^(-1/3)\n    *   To solve for the period ratio (P₂ / P₁), we need to raise both sides of the equation to the power of -3.\n    *   (7 / 5)^(-3) = [ (P₂ / P₁)^(-1/3) ]^(-3)\n    *   (5 / 7)³ = P₂ / P₁\n\n6.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = (5 * 5 * 5) / (7 * 7 * 7) = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.3644\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated value is approximately 0.36, which matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
