    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Goal\nThe main objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, which is `T_eq1 / T_eq2`.\n\n### 2. Equilibrium Temperature Formula\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates back into space. The formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * ( (1 - A) / f )^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / a)\n\nWhere:\n*   `T_star` is the star's effective temperature.\n*   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   `A` is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n*   `f` is a factor representing heat redistribution (typically assumed to be 4 for a fast-rotating planet that radiates heat evenly).\n\n### 3. Forming the Ratio\nWe need to calculate the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2`:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * ((1 - A1)/f1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / a1)] / [T_star * ((1 - A2)/f2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / a2)]\n\nThe problem provides several key pieces of information that simplify this ratio:\n*   Both planets orbit the same star, so `T_star` and `R_star` are the same and cancel out.\n*   Both planets have the same albedo, so `A1 = A2`, and the `(1 - A)` term cancels out.\n*   Without information to the contrary, we assume the heat redistribution factor `f` is the same for both planets, so `f1 = f2`, and it cancels out.\n\nAfter simplification, the ratio becomes:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(1 / a1) / sqrt(1 / a2) = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\nThis means we only need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes (`a2 / a1`) to determine the temperature ratio.\n\n### 4. Finding the Semi-Major Axis (`a`)\nThe problem does not give the semi-major axes directly, but it provides radial velocity (RV) data in the form of a Doppler shift (Δλ). We can relate the semi-major axis to the observed Doppler shift.\n\nFirst, the maximum radial velocity of the star (K_star), also known as the RV semi-amplitude, is related to the maximum Doppler shift by the non-relativistic Doppler formula:\n\nK_star = c * (Δλ_max / λ₀)\n\nWhere `c` is the speed of light, `Δλ_max` is the maximum wavelength shift, and `λ₀` is the rest wavelength.\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the star's velocity (K_star, assuming we observe edge-on where sin(i)≈1) is related to the planet's mass (m_p), the star's mass (M_star), and the semi-major axis (`a`) by:\n\nK_star ≈ (m_p / M_star) * v_planet\n\nWhere the planet's orbital velocity is `v_planet ≈ sqrt(G * M_star / a)`. Substituting this in gives:\n\nK_star ≈ (m_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a) = m_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))\n\nNow, we solve for `a`:\n\nK_star² ≈ m_p² * G / (M_star * a)\na ≈ (G * m_p² ) / (M_star * K_star²)\n\n### 5. Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (`a2 / a1`)\nNow we can form the ratio `a2 / a1` using the formula derived above:\n\na2 / a1 = [ (G * m_p2²) / (M_star * K_star2²) ] / [ (G * m_p1²) / (M_star * K_star1²) ]\n\nThe gravitational constant `G` and the star's mass `M_star` are the same for both and cancel out:\n\na2 / a1 = (m_p2² / K_star2²) * (K_star1² / m_p1²)\na2 / a1 = (m_p2 / m_p1)² * (K_star1 / K_star2)²\n\nWe can find the ratio `K_star1 / K_star2` from the given Doppler shifts:\n\nK_star1 / K_star2 = [c * (Δλ1 / λ₀)] / [c * (Δλ2 / λ₀)] = Δλ1 / Δλ2\n\n### 6. Plugging in the Values\nNow, we substitute the values from the problem:\n\n*   Mass ratio: `m_p2 / m_p1 = 5 Earth masses / 7 Earth masses = 5/7`\n*   Doppler shift ratio: `Δλ1 / Δλ2 = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3/4`. This is also the ratio `K_star1 / K_star2`.\n\nSubstitute these ratios into the equation for `a2 / a1`:\n\na2 / a1 = (5/7)² * (3/4)² = (25/49) * (9/16) = 225 / 784\n\n### 7. Final Calculation\nFinally, we calculate the temperature ratio using the `a2 / a1` value:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1) = sqrt(225 / 784) = 15 / 28\n\nTo get the final numerical answer, we perform the division.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Ratio of planet masses (m_p2 / m_p1)\nm_ratio = 5 / 7\n\n# Ratio of the star's radial velocity semi-amplitudes (K_star1 / K_star2)\n# This is equal to the ratio of the maximum Doppler shifts (Δλ1 / Δλ2)\nK_ratio = 0.03 / 0.04\n\n# The ratio of the semi-major axes (a2 / a1) is given by:\n# a2 / a1 = (m_p2 / m_p1)^2 * (K_star1 / K_star2)^2\na_ratio_2_over_1 = (m_ratio**2) * (K_ratio**2)\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures (T_eq1 / T_eq2) is given by:\n# T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\nT_ratio = math.sqrt(a_ratio_2_over_1)\n\nprint(f\"{T_ratio:.4f}\")\n```\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by the formula:\n`T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`\n(Assuming a heat redistribution factor `f=2` for simplicity, though this factor cancels out in the ratio).\n\nWhere:\n- `T_star` is the effective temperature of the star.\n- `R_star` is the radius of the star.\n- `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n- `A` is the albedo of the planet.\n\nWe need to find the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2`.\n\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a1))^(1/2) * (1 - A1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a2))^(1/2) * (1 - A2)^(1/4)]`\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star, `T_star` and `R_star` are the same and cancel out. The problem states that both planets have the same albedo (`A1 = A2`), so the `(1 - A)` term also cancels out. The equation simplifies to:\n\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (1 / a1)^(1/2) / (1 / a2)^(1/2) = (a2 / a1)^(1/2) = sqrt(a2 / a1)`\n\nNow, we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes, `a2 / a1`. We can do this using the information from the radial velocity method.\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude `K` of a star due to an orbiting planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n`K = (2 * pi * G / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i) / M_star^(2/3))`\nwhere `m_p` is the planet mass, `M_star` is the star mass, `P` is the orbital period, `G` is the gravitational constant, and `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\nFrom Kepler's Third Law: `P^2 = (4 * pi^2 / (G * M_star)) * a^3`.\nSolving for `a`: `a = (G * M_star * P^2 / (4 * pi^2))^(1/3)`\n\nLet's find a more direct relationship between `a` and the given quantities.\nThe star's maximum radial velocity `K_star` is related to the maximum Doppler shift `Δλ` by:\n`K_star = c * (Δλ / λ₀)`\nwhere `c` is the speed of light and `λ₀` is the rest wavelength.\n\nFor a circular orbit, the star's velocity `K_star` (assuming `sin(i) = 1` as is common in these problems unless stated otherwise) is related to the planet's mass `m_p` and semi-major axis `a` by the conservation of momentum:\n`M_star * v_star = m_p * v_p`\n`M_star * K_star = m_p * sqrt(G * M_star / a)`  (since `v_p = sqrt(G*M_star/a)` for a low-mass planet)\n\nSolving for `K_star`:\n`K_star = (m_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a) = m_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))`\n\nNow, let's solve for `a`:\n`K_star^2 = m_p^2 * G / (M_star * a)`\n`a = (G * m_p^2) / (M_star * K_star^2)`\n\nNow we can form the ratio `a2 / a1`:\n`a2 / a1 = [ (G * m_p2^2) / (M_star * K_star2^2) ] / [ (G * m_p1^2) / (M_star * K_star1^2) ]`\n\nThe terms `G` and `M_star` cancel out:\n`a2 / a1 = (m_p2^2 / K_star2^2) * (K_star1^2 / m_p1^2) = (m_p2 / m_p1)^2 * (K_star1 / K_star2)^2`\n\nThe ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes `K_star1 / K_star2` is equal to the ratio of their observed Doppler shifts `Δλ1 / Δλ2`:\n`K_star1 / K_star2 = (c * Δλ1 / λ₀) / (c * Δλ2 / λ₀) = Δλ1 / Δλ2`\n\nSo, `a2 / a1 = (m_p2 / m_p1)^2 * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)^2`\n\nNow, let's plug in the given values:\n- `m_p1 = 7` Earth masses\n- `m_p2 = 5` Earth masses\n- `Δλ1 = 0.03 Å`\n- `Δλ2 = 0.04 Å`\n\n`m_p2 / m_p1 = 5 / 7`\n`Δλ1 / Δλ2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4`\n\n`a2 / a1 = (5 / 7)^2 * (3 / 4)^2 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16) = 225 / 784`\n\nFinally, we calculate the temperature ratio:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1) = sqrt(225 / 784) = 15 / 28`\n\n`15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<A>>>"
