    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem Statement:**\n    *   We are given a relationship between the number of stars (let's call it `N`) and their parallax (`plx`). The relationship is `N ∝ 1/plx^5`.\n    *   We need to find how the number of stars *per unit range of distance* varies with distance (`r`). This quantity is the differential `dN/dr`.\n\n2.  **Interpret the Given Relationship:**\n    *   In astronomy, when discussing star counts, a statement like \"the number of stars varies with...\" typically refers to a cumulative count.\n    *   In this case, \"the number of stars varies with parallax\" means the total number of stars with a parallax *greater than* a certain value `plx`. Let's denote this as `N(>plx)`.\n    *   So, our starting point is `N(>plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`.\n\n3.  **Relate Parallax to Distance:**\n    *   Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. The fundamental relationship is `plx = 1/r`, where `r` is the distance in parsecs and `plx` is the parallax in arcseconds.\n    *   This means that observing stars with a parallax *greater than* `plx` is equivalent to observing stars *within* a distance `r = 1/plx`.\n\n4.  **Express the Number of Stars as a Function of Distance:**\n    *   The cumulative number of stars within a distance `r`, which we can call `N_cumulative(r)`, is the same as the number of stars with a parallax greater than `1/r`.\n    *   So, `N_cumulative(r) = N(>1/r)`.\n    *   We can substitute `plx = 1/r` into our initial relationship:\n        `N_cumulative(r) ∝ 1 / (1/r)^5`\n        `N_cumulative(r) ∝ 1 / (r^-5)`\n        `N_cumulative(r) ∝ r^5`\n    *   This tells us that the total number of stars observed out to a distance `r` is proportional to the fifth power of the distance.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Number of Stars per Unit Distance:**\n    *   The question asks for \"how the number of stars... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)\". This is the rate of change of the cumulative number of stars with respect to distance, or `dN_cumulative(r)/dr`. This represents the number of stars in a thin shell at distance `r`.\n    *   We need to differentiate our expression for `N_cumulative(r)` with respect to `r`.\n    *   Let `N_cumulative(r) = k * r^5`, where `k` is a constant of proportionality.\n    *   `dN_cumulative(r)/dr = d/dr (k * r^5)`\n    *   Using the power rule for differentiation, `d/dx(x^n) = n*x^(n-1)`, we get:\n        `dN_cumulative(r)/dr = k * 5 * r^(5-1)`\n        `dN_cumulative(r)/dr = 5k * r^4`\n    *   Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to `r^4`.\n        `dN/dr ∝ r^4`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   The result `~ r^4` matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
