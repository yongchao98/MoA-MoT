    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the core concept:** The problem describes radioactive decay, which is a classic example of a memoryless process. The key principle of a memoryless process is that the probability of an event happening in the future is independent of how long we have been waiting for it. In this case, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes does not change its intrinsic probability of decaying in any future time interval.\n\n2.  **Define the mathematical model:** Radioactive decay follows an exponential distribution. Let T be the lifetime of the atom. The probability that the atom survives past time t is given by the survival function:\n    $P(T > t) = e^{-\\lambda t}$\n    where $\\lambda$ is the decay constant.\n\n    The probability that the atom decays by time t is given by the cumulative distribution function (CDF):\n    $P(T \\le t) = 1 - P(T > t) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda t}$\n\n3.  **Use the given information to find the parameters of the model:** We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    $P(T \\le 100) = 0.32$\n    $1 - e^{-100\\lambda} = 0.32$\n\n    From this, we can find the probability of the atom *surviving* for 100 minutes:\n    $P(T > 100) = e^{-100\\lambda} = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68$\n\n4.  **Formulate the question in mathematical terms:** We need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes. This is a conditional probability:\n    $P(\\text{decay between 50 and 200 min} | \\text{survived past 50 min})$\n    $P(T \\le 200 | T > 50)$\n\n5.  **Apply the memoryless property:** For an exponential distribution, the memoryless property states that $P(T \\le t_0 + \\Delta t | T > t_0) = P(T \\le \\Delta t)$.\n    In our case, $t_0 = 50$ minutes and the future interval is $\\Delta t = 150$ minutes.\n    Therefore, the problem simplifies to finding the probability that a new atom (or the same atom, starting from now) decays in the next 150 minutes.\n    We need to calculate:\n    $P(T \\le 150) = 1 - e^{-150\\lambda}$\n\n6.  **Calculate the required probability:** We need to find the value of $e^{-150\\lambda}$. We can derive this from the value we already know, $e^{-100\\lambda} = 0.68$.\n    We can write $150\\lambda$ as $100\\lambda \\times 1.5$.\n    So, $e^{-150\\lambda} = e^{-100\\lambda \\times 1.5} = (e^{-100\\lambda})^{1.5}$\n    Substituting the known value:\n    $e^{-150\\lambda} = (0.68)^{1.5}$\n\n    The probability of decay in 150 minutes is:\n    $P(\\text{decay in 150 min}) = 1 - (0.68)^{1.5}$\n\n7.  **Compute the final numerical answer:** Now, we perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The probability of surviving 100 minutes is P(T > 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.\n# We know P(T > 100) = exp(-lambda * 100).\n# We want to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes.\n# Due to the memoryless property, this is P(T <= 150) = 1 - exp(-lambda * 150).\n# We can express exp(-lambda * 150) in terms of exp(-lambda * 100).\n# exp(-lambda * 150) = exp(-lambda * 100 * 1.5) = (exp(-lambda * 100))**1.5\n# P_survival_150 = (0.68)**1.5\n# The probability of decay is 1 - P_survival_150.\n\np_survival_150 = 0.68 ** 1.5\np_decay_150 = 1 - p_survival_150\n\nprint(p_decay_150 * 100)\n```\n<execute_result>\n43.92583994819958\n</execute_result>\nThe calculation gives a probability of approximately 43.93%.\n\n8.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    A) 44%\n    B) 48%\n    C) 52%\n    D) 40%\n\n    The calculated value of 43.93% is closest to 44%.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics Principle:** The problem deals with radioactive decay. A fundamental characteristic of radioactive decay is that it is a *memoryless process*. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed. The atom does not \"age\". Therefore, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes does not change its intrinsic decay probability for any future period.\n\n2.  **Define the Mathematical Model:** Radioactive decay follows an exponential probability distribution.\n    *   Let $\\lambda$ be the decay constant.\n    *   The probability that an atom survives for a time $t$ is given by the survival function, $S(t) = P(\\text{survive past time } t) = e^{-\\lambda t}$.\n    *   The probability that an atom decays within a time $t$ is given by the cumulative distribution function, $F(t) = P(\\text{decay by time } t) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda t}$.\n\n3.  **Use the Given Information to Find a Parameter:** We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%.\n    *   $P(\\text{decay by 100 min}) = 0.32$\n    *   $1 - e^{-100\\lambda} = 0.32$\n    *   From this, we can find the probability of the atom *surviving* for 100 minutes:\n        $P(\\text{survive past 100 min}) = e^{-100\\lambda} = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68$.\n\n4.  **Formulate and Simplify the Question:** We are asked to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes.\n    *   This is a conditional probability: $P(\\text{decays between t=50 and t=200} | \\text{survived past t=50})$.\n    *   Because of the memoryless property, the condition \"survived past t=50\" is irrelevant to the future probability. The question simplifies to: \"What is the probability a new atom will decay in the next 150 minutes?\"\n    *   So, we need to calculate $P(\\text{decay by 150 min}) = 1 - e^{-150\\lambda}$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Required Probability:**\n    *   We need to find the value of $e^{-150\\lambda}$.\n    *   We can relate this to the value we already know, $e^{-100\\lambda} = 0.68$.\n    *   Using the properties of exponents:\n        $e^{-150\\lambda} = e^{-100\\lambda \\times 1.5} = (e^{-100\\lambda})^{1.5}$\n    *   Substitute the known value:\n        $e^{-150\\lambda} = (0.68)^{1.5}$\n    *   Now, calculate the probability of decay in 150 minutes:\n        $P(\\text{decay by 150 min}) = 1 - (0.68)^{1.5}$\n\n6.  **Compute the Final Value:**\n    *   Using a calculator or the provided Python script:\n        $(0.68)^{1.5} \\approx 0.5607$\n    *   Probability of decay = $1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393$\n    *   Converting this to a percentage gives $43.93\\%$.\n\n7.  **Select the Closest Answer:**\n    The calculated probability is 43.93%, which is closest to 44%.\n\n<<<A>>>"
