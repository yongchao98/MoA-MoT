    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct conclusion:\n\n### 1. Understand the Definitions of λ1 and λ2\n\n*   **λ1**: This is the mean free path (MFP) of the residual gas molecules within the vacuum chamber. It describes the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with another gas molecule.\n*   **λ2**: This is the mean free path of the high-energy electrons from the microscope's beam. It describes the average distance an electron travels before it is scattered (collides) by a residual gas molecule.\n\n### 2. Recall the Formulas for Mean Free Path\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is generally defined as λ = 1 / (n * σ), where `n` is the number density of target particles and `σ` is the collision cross-section. However, the specific formula depends on the nature of the colliding particles.\n\n*   **For λ1 (Gas-Gas Collisions):**\n    When considering collisions between identical molecules in a gas, the molecules are all in motion. The kinetic theory of gases accounts for this relative motion, leading to the formula:\n    λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the gas molecules.\n    *   `σ_gg` is the kinetic collision cross-section between two gas molecules. This is roughly πd², where 'd' is the effective diameter of the molecule.\n    *   The `√2` factor is crucial and arises from averaging over the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of velocities for both the projectile and target molecules.\n\n*   **For λ2 (Electron-Gas Collisions):**\n    The electrons in a 1000 kV Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) are moving at relativistic speeds, extremely fast compared to the thermal motion of the residual gas molecules. Therefore, the gas molecules can be considered stationary targets. The formula for the MFP of a particle moving through stationary targets is:\n    λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the same number density of gas molecules.\n    *   `σ_eg` is the total scattering cross-section for an electron colliding with a gas molecule.\n\n### 3. Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg)\n\nThe core of the problem lies in comparing the effective \"size\" of a gas molecule as seen by another gas molecule (σ_gg) versus as seen by a high-energy electron (σ_eg).\n\n*   **σ_gg (Gas-Gas):** This cross-section is determined by the molecule's electron cloud. When two molecules approach each other, their electron clouds repel, defining a relatively large effective diameter. This is a \"soft\" interaction, but it effectively prevents the molecules from passing through each other.\n\n*   **σ_eg (Electron-Gas):** A high-energy electron (1000 keV) is a tiny, point-like particle. It can easily penetrate the diffuse electron cloud of a gas molecule. A significant interaction or \"collision\" (i.e., scattering) primarily happens only if the electron passes very close to the dense, positively charged nucleus of one of the atoms in the molecule. Since the nucleus is vastly smaller than the atom itself (by about 5 orders of magnitude in radius), the effective target area for the electron (σ_eg) is much smaller than the overall kinetic size of the molecule (σ_gg).\n\nTherefore, we can confidently conclude that **σ_gg > σ_eg**. In fact, for 1 MeV electrons, σ_gg is several orders of magnitude larger than σ_eg.\n\n### 4. Determine the Relationship Between λ1 and λ2\n\nLet's find the ratio of λ2 to λ1 using the formulas from step 2:\n\nλ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)]\n\nBy simplifying the expression, we get:\n\nλ2 / λ1 = (√2 * n * σ_gg) / (n * σ_eg)\n**λ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)**\n\n### 5. Evaluate the Result and Choose the Correct Option\n\nNow we combine the findings from steps 3 and 4:\n\n*   We know √2 ≈ 1.414.\n*   We established that σ_gg > σ_eg, which means the ratio (σ_gg / σ_eg) is a number greater than 1.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the mean free paths must be:\nλ2 / λ1 > √2 * 1\nλ2 / λ1 > 1.414\n\nThis means that **λ2 > 1.414 * λ1**. The mean free path for the electrons is significantly longer than the mean free path for the gas molecules.\n\nNow let's check this result against the given options:\nA) λ2 < λ1  (Incorrect)\nB) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 (Incorrect, since our result shows λ2 > 1.414 * λ1)\nC) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 (Correct. Our derived inequality, λ2 > 1.414 * λ1, satisfies this condition because any number greater than 1.414 is also greater than or equal to 1.22)\nD) λ2 = λ1 (Incorrect)\n\nEven in the most conservative (and physically unrealistic) case where the electron scattering cross-section was equal to the gas kinetic cross-section (σ_eg = σ_gg), the ratio would be λ2/λ1 = √2 ≈ 1.414, which still falls under option C. The fact that σ_eg is actually much smaller than σ_gg only makes the inequality stronger.\n\n<<<C>>>"
