    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the maximum speed of the 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator.\n\n1.  **Principle of Conservation of Energy**\n    The total energy (E) of the system is conserved. It is the sum of the kinetic energy (KE) and the potential energy (PE).\n    E = KE + PE\n\n2.  **Relativistic Kinetic Energy and Potential Energy**\n    *   The kinetic energy of a particle with rest mass *m* moving at speed *v* is given by the relativistic formula:\n        KE = (γ - 1)mc²\n        where γ is the Lorentz factor, γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²), and *c* is the speed of light.\n    *   The potential energy of a harmonic oscillator obeying Hooke's law (F = -kx) at a displacement *x* from the equilibrium is:\n        PE = (1/2)kx²\n\n    So, the total energy at any point in the oscillation is:\n    E = (γ - 1)mc² + (1/2)kx²\n\n3.  **Analyze the System at Two Key Points**\n\n    *   **At maximum amplitude (x = A):**\n        The mass momentarily stops before changing direction. Therefore, its speed is zero (v = 0).\n        When v = 0, the Lorentz factor γ = 1 / √(1 - 0²/c²) = 1.\n        The kinetic energy is KE = (1 - 1)mc² = 0.\n        The potential energy is at its maximum: PE_max = (1/2)kA².\n        The total energy of the system is E = 0 + (1/2)kA² = (1/2)kA².\n\n    *   **At the equilibrium position (x = 0):**\n        The mass is moving at its maximum speed (v = v_max).\n        The potential energy is zero: PE = (1/2)k(0)² = 0.\n        The kinetic energy is at its maximum: KE_max = (γ_max - 1)mc², where γ_max = 1 / √(1 - v_max²/c²).\n        The total energy of the system is E = (γ_max - 1)mc² + 0 = (γ_max - 1)mc².\n\n4.  **Equate the Total Energies**\n    Since energy is conserved, the total energy at the maximum amplitude must be equal to the total energy at the equilibrium position.\n    (γ_max - 1)mc² = (1/2)kA²\n\n5.  **Solve for v_max**\n    First, let's isolate γ_max from the equation above:\n    γ_max - 1 = (kA²) / (2mc²)\n    γ_max = 1 + (kA²) / (2mc²)\n\n    Now, substitute the definition of γ_max:\n    1 / √(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 + (kA²) / (2mc²)\n\n    To solve for v_max, we rearrange the equation. First, invert both sides:\n    √(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 / (1 + (kA²) / (2mc²))\n\n    Square both sides:\n    1 - v_max²/c² = 1 / (1 + (kA²) / (2mc²))²\n\n    Rearrange to solve for v_max²/c²:\n    v_max²/c² = 1 - 1 / (1 + (kA²) / (2mc²))²\n\n    Finally, take the square root and multiply by *c* to get v_max:\n    v_max = c * √[1 - 1 / (1 + (kA²) / (2mc²))²]\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options**\n    The derived expression for v_max is:\n    $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n    This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
