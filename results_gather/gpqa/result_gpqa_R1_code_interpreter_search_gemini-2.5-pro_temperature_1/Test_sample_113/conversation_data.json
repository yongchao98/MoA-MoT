    "*   **Analysis of the first reaction:**\n    *   **Reaction:** butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n    *   **Reactants:** butan-2-one is a ketone (CH₃COCH₂CH₃). NaCN is a source of the cyanide nucleophile (CN⁻).\n    *   **Product:** 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile is a cyanohydrin.\n    *   **Mechanism:** This reaction is a nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl group, known as cyanohydrin formation.\n        1.  The cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n        2.  This breaks the C=O pi bond and forms a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate.\n        3.  This intermediate, [CH₃C(O⁻)(CN)CH₂CH₃], needs to be protonated to form the final hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   **Role of A:** Reagent 'A' must be a proton source. In the given options, H₃O⁺ represents an acidic aqueous solution (like dilute HCl or H₂SO₄), which is a standard choice for protonating the alkoxide in the workup step. NaHSO₃ is used for a different type of addition reaction with carbonyls and is not correct for this transformation.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** A = H₃O⁺.\n\n*   **Analysis of the second reaction:**\n    *   **Reaction:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid\n    *   **Transformation:** The key change is the conversion of the nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This is a hydrolysis reaction.\n    *   **Mechanism:** The hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid can be catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base upon heating.\n        *   **Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis:** Heating the nitrile with a strong aqueous acid (like HCl or H₂SO₄) will convert it to a carboxylic acid.\n        *   **Base-catalyzed hydrolysis:** Heating the nitrile with a strong aqueous base (like NaOH) will produce a carboxylate salt, which then requires an acidic workup to form the final carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Role of B:** Reagent 'B' acts as a catalyst for the hydrolysis in the presence of water (H₂O).\n        *   Comparing the options for B, HCl is a strong acid, while CH₃COOH (acetic acid) is a weak acid.\n        *   The hydrolysis of a nitrile is a relatively slow reaction that requires harsh conditions (heat and a strong catalyst). A strong acid like HCl is a much more effective and standard reagent for this conversion than a weak acid like CH₃COOH.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** B = HCl.\n\n*   **Final Decision:**\n    *   Based on the analysis, reagent A is H₃O⁺ and reagent B is HCl.\n    *   This combination matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
