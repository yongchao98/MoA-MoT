    "Here is my thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to Star_2, which is $L_1 / L_2$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Relevant Physics Principles:**\n    *   **Luminosity of a Black Body:** The luminosity (total power radiated) of a star, assuming it's a perfect black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:\n        $L = A \\cdot \\sigma \\cdot T^4 = 4 \\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\n        where R is the star's radius, T is its surface temperature, and Ïƒ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   **Peak Wavelength and Temperature:** The temperature of a black body is related to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation ($\\lambda_{max}$) by Wien's Displacement Law:\n        $\\lambda_{max} = b / T$\n        where b is Wien's displacement constant. This means temperature is inversely proportional to the peak emission wavelength ($T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{max}$). It's important to note that this $\\lambda_{max}$ is the one emitted in the star's own rest frame ($\\lambda_{rest}$).\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** The observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) of light from a moving source is different from the wavelength emitted in its rest frame ($\\lambda_{rest}$). For non-relativistic speeds (where velocity v is much less than the speed of light c), the change in wavelength is given by:\n        $\\lambda_{obs} \\approx \\lambda_{rest} (1 + v_r/c)$\n        where $v_r$ is the radial velocity (positive for receding, negative for approaching).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Given Information:**\n    *   Radius ratio: $R_1 = 1.5 \\cdot R_2 \\implies R_1 / R_2 = 1.5$\n    *   Mass ratio: $M_1 = 1.5 \\cdot M_2$. This is likely extra information (a distractor), as the Stefan-Boltzmann law does not directly depend on mass.\n    *   Radial velocities: $v_{r1} = 0$ km/s, $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s.\n    *   Peak Wavelength: \"the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest... are the same.\" The phrase \"appeared brightest\" refers to the wavelength observed by the astronomers on Earth. Therefore, their observed peak wavelengths are equal: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$.\n\n4.  **Formulate a Plan:**\n    a.  Write down the expression for the luminosity ratio $L_1 / L_2$ using the Stefan-Boltzmann law.\n    b.  Use the information about the observed peak wavelengths and radial velocities to determine the ratio of the stars' true surface temperatures, $T_1 / T_2$.\n    c.  Substitute the radius ratio and the calculated temperature ratio into the luminosity ratio expression to find the final answer.\n\n5.  **Execute the Plan:**\n\n    *   **Step a: Luminosity Ratio**\n        Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law for both stars:\n        $L_1 = 4 \\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4$\n        $L_2 = 4 \\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4$\n        The ratio is:\n        $L_1 / L_2 = (4 \\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4) / (4 \\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4) = (R_1/R_2)^2 \\cdot (T_1/T_2)^4$\n        We know $R_1/R_2 = 1.5$, so:\n        $L_1 / L_2 = (1.5)^2 \\cdot (T_1/T_2)^4 = 2.25 \\cdot (T_1/T_2)^4$\n\n    *   **Step b: Temperature Ratio**\n        The temperature is related to the rest-frame peak wavelength: $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{rest}$. So, $T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{rest,2}/\\lambda_{rest,1}$.\n        We need to find the relationship between $\\lambda_{rest,1}$ and $\\lambda_{rest,2}$ from the observed wavelengths.\n        For Star_1: $v_{r1} = 0$, so its observed wavelength is the same as its rest wavelength: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{rest,1}$.\n        For Star_2: $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s. A positive radial velocity usually indicates the object is moving away (receding), causing a redshift.\n        $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{rest,2} (1 + v_{r2}/c)$.\n        We are given that $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$.\n        Therefore, $\\lambda_{rest,1} = \\lambda_{rest,2} (1 + v_{r2}/c)$.\n        Now we can find the ratio of the rest wavelengths:\n        $\\lambda_{rest,2}/\\lambda_{rest,1} = 1 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)$.\n        Since $T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{rest,2}/\\lambda_{rest,1}$, we have:\n        $T_1/T_2 = 1 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)$.\n        This makes physical sense: since Star 2 is moving away, its light is redshifted. For its observed peak to match Star 1's, its actual (rest) peak must be at a shorter wavelength, meaning Star 2 is intrinsically hotter than Star 1 ($T_2 > T_1$).\n\n    *   **Step c: Final Calculation**\n        Substitute the temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n        $L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 \\cdot (T_1/T_2)^4 = 2.25 \\cdot [1 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)]^4$\n        Now, plug in the values. I will use a python script for precision.\n        -   $v_{r2} = 700 \\text{ km/s} = 700,000 \\text{ m/s}$\n        -   $c$ (speed of light) $\\approx 299,792,458 \\text{ m/s}$\n\n```python\n# Constants and given values\nR1_div_R2_sq = 1.5**2\nvr2 = 700 * 1000  # Radial velocity of Star 2 in m/s\nc = 299792458    # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# Calculate the temperature ratio T1/T2\n# T1/T2 = 1 / (1 + vr2/c)\nT1_div_T2 = 1 / (1 + vr2 / c)\n\n# Calculate the final luminosity ratio L1/L2\n# L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4\nluminosity_ratio = R1_div_R2_sq * (T1_div_T2**4)\n\nprint(luminosity_ratio)\n```\n\nThe computed luminosity ratio is approximately 2.229. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~2.35\nB) ~2.25 (This would be the answer if the Doppler effect were ignored)\nC) ~2.32\nD) ~2.23\n\nThe calculated value of 2.229 is closest to 2.23.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The user wants me to solve a physics problem about the luminosity of two stars.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the problem and identify key information:**\n*   **Goal:** Find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to Star_2 ($L_1/L_2$).\n*   **Star 1 vs. Star 2:**\n    *   Radius: $R_1 = 1.5 \\cdot R_2$\n    *   Mass: $M_1 = 1.5 \\cdot M_2$ (This is likely extra information, as luminosity in the black body model doesn't depend on mass).\n    *   Radial Velocity: $v_{r1} = 0$ km/s, $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s.\n    *   Peak Brightness Wavelength: The *observed* peak wavelengths are equal: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$.\n*   **Assumption:** The stars radiate as black bodies.\n\n**2. Recall relevant physical laws:**\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a black body is given by $L = A \\cdot \\sigma \\cdot T^4$, where A is the surface area ($4\\pi R^2$), $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the surface temperature.\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** The temperature (T) of a black body is related to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation in its *rest frame* ($\\lambda_{rest}$) by the equation $\\lambda_{rest} \\cdot T = b$, where b is Wien's constant. This implies $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{rest}$.\n*   **Doppler Effect for Light:** The observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) is related to the rest-frame emitted wavelength ($\\lambda_{rest}$) and the radial velocity ($v_r$) by the formula $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{rest} (1 + v_r/c)$, where c is the speed of light.\n\n**3. Formulate a step-by-step solution:**\n*   **Step 1: Write the luminosity ratio.**\n    Using the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:\n    $L_1 = 4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4$\n    $L_2 = 4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4$\n    The ratio is:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4$\n    We are given $R_1/R_2 = 1.5$, so this becomes:\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4$\n\n*   **Step 2: Find the temperature ratio ($T_1/T_2$).**\n    From Wien's Law, we know $T_1 \\propto 1/\\lambda_{rest,1}$ and $T_2 \\propto 1/\\lambda_{rest,2}$.\n    Therefore, $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{rest,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,1}}$.\n    We need to find the ratio of the rest-frame wavelengths.\n\n*   **Step 3: Use the Doppler effect to relate rest-frame wavelengths.**\n    We are given that the observed wavelengths are equal: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$.\n    For Star 1 ($v_{r1} = 0$): $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{rest,1}(1 + 0/c) = \\lambda_{rest,1}$.\n    For Star 2 ($v_{r2} = 700$ km/s): $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{rest,2}(1 + v_{r2}/c)$.\n    Since $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$, we have:\n    $\\lambda_{rest,1} = \\lambda_{rest,2}(1 + v_{r2}/c)$.\n    Rearranging this to find the ratio we need for the temperature calculation:\n    $\\frac{\\lambda_{rest,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_{r2}/c}$.\n\n*   **Step 4: Substitute the wavelength ratio into the temperature ratio.**\n    $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_{r2}/c}$.\n\n*   **Step 5: Substitute the temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio equation and calculate the final value.**\n    $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_{r2}/c}\\right)^4$.\n    Now, plug in the numbers:\n    *   $v_{r2} = 700 \\text{ km/s} = 700,000 \\text{ m/s}$\n    *   $c \\approx 299,792,458 \\text{ m/s}$\n\n    The calculation is: $\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + 700000 / 299792458}\\right)^4$.\n    This calculation was performed by the code in the thinking process.\n\n**4. Review the code output and conclude:**\n*   The code calculated the value to be `2.229107561148499`.\n*   Rounding this value to two decimal places gives `2.23`.\n*   This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
