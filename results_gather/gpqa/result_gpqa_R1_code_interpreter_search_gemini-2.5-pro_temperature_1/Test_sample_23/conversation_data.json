    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   Z is a saturated hydrocarbon, meaning its general formula is CnH2n+2 (alkane) or CnH2n (cycloalkane).\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is given as 14.28%. This value is very close to 1/7. Let's verify this: 1/7 ≈ 0.142857.\n*   Let the molecular formula of Z be CnHm. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by:\n    Mass Fraction (H) = (m × AtomicMass(H)) / (n × AtomicMass(C) + m × AtomicMass(H))\n*   Using integer atomic masses (C≈12, H≈1), we have:\n    m / (12n + m) = 1/7\n    7m = 12n + m\n    6m = 12n\n    m = 2n\n*   This means the formula for Z is CnH2n. Since Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (it does not react further with hydrogen), it must be a **cycloalkane**.\n*   We need to find the specific cycloalkane. The problem states Z is widely used as a solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n*   Let's verify the mass fraction for cyclohexane (C6H12):\n    Mass of Hydrogen = 12 × 1.008 = 12.096\n    Mass of Carbon = 6 × 12.011 = 72.066\n    Total Molar Mass = 84.162 g/mol\n    Mass Fraction (H) = 12.096 / 84.162 ≈ 0.1437. Using integer masses: 12 / (6*12 + 12) = 12/84 = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857. This is a perfect match for 14.28%.\n*   Thus, **Z is cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n*   Y does not decolorize bromine water. This implies the components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   Hydrogenation of Y under severe conditions gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n*   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of mixture Y.\n*   Let Y be a mixture of {Y1, Y2}. We know one component is Z, so let Y2 = Z = cyclohexane (C6H12).\n*   Hydrogenation of Y = {Y1, cyclohexane} gives only cyclohexane. Cyclohexane is already saturated, so it does not react. This means that hydrogenation of Y1 must produce cyclohexane.\n*   Y1 must have a C6 carbon skeleton.\n*   Y1 does not decolorize bromine water. An alkene or alkyne would, but an aromatic compound like benzene reacts very slowly with bromine water without a catalyst.\n*   The most plausible candidate for Y1 is **benzene (C6H6)**. Hydrogenation of benzene gives cyclohexane (C6H6 + 3H2 -> C6H12). Benzene is a liquid and does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions.\n*   Therefore, **mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of benzene (C6H6) and cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the reaction from X to Y and find the properties of Mixture X**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them X1 and X2.\n*   The reaction is: Mixture X --(Pt, heat)--> Mixture Y. This is described as a disproportionation.\n*   Since the reactant (X) and product (Y) mixtures are both equimolar, the reaction stoichiometry must be 1:1 for the components.\n    1 molecule of X1 + 1 molecule of X2  →  1 molecule of C6H6 + 1 molecule of C6H12\n*   This reaction is a catalytic hydrogen transfer. One component of X is dehydrogenated to benzene, and the other is hydrogenated to cyclohexane.\n*   According to the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the reaction.\n*   Let's focus on the hydrogen atoms:\n    Total H in reactants = Total H in products\n    Number of H in X1 + Number of H in X2 = Number of H in C6H6 + Number of H in C6H12\n    Number of H in X1 + Number of H in X2 = 6 + 12\n    Number of H in X1 + Number of H in X2 = 18\n\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of the number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each liquid component.\n*   From our analysis, this sum is 18.\n\n**Step 4: Consistency Check**\n\n*   Does this model fit all the given information?\n    *   **Hydrogenation of X**: Hydrogenation of both X1 and X2 must give only cyclohexane. This implies X1 and X2 must be C6 cyclic compounds. For example, if X = {cyclohexene (C6H10), 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)}, both hydrogenate to cyclohexane.\n    *   **Bromine water test**: Mixture X decolorizes bromine water. Both cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene contain C=C double bonds and would decolorize bromine water.\n    *   **No conjugated bonds**: 1,4-cyclohexadiene has non-conjugated double bonds. Cyclohexene has only one double bond. This condition is satisfied.\n    *   **H atom count**: For our example X = {C6H10, C6H8}, the total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. This is consistent with our calculation.\n\nThe logic is sound and all conditions of the problem are met. The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each of the two liquids in mixture X is 18.\n\nFinal Answer Selection:\nThe calculated total number of hydrogen atoms is 18. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
