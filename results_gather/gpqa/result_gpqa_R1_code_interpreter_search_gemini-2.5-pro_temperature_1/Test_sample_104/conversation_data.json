    "Here's my thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** The core of the question is to compare two different phenomena that cause a star's brightness to dim periodically:\n    *   **Scenario 1 (Stellar Spots):** A star has one hemisphere covered in dark spots. As it rotates, we see the bright, unspotted hemisphere and then the darker, spotty hemisphere, causing a periodic dip and rise in brightness.\n    *   **Scenario 2 (Exoplanet Transit):** A hypothetical planet passes in front of an otherwise uniform, unspotted star, blocking some of its light and causing a dip in brightness.\n\n    The goal is to find the size of the planet (relative to the star) that would produce the same brightness dip (amplitude) as the rotating spotted star.\n\n2.  **Analyze Scenario 1: The Spotted Star**\n    *   The change in brightness is due to the difference in flux between the \"bright\" side and the \"dark\" side.\n    *   The flux (energy per unit area per unit time) emitted by a surface is described by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: F = σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature.\n    *   Let's define the key parameters:\n        *   Star's effective temperature, T_eff = 6000 K.\n        *   Spot temperature, T_spot = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K.\n        *   Spot filling factor, `f` = 20% = 0.20. This is the fraction of the spotty hemisphere's area that is covered by spots.\n\n    *   **Maximum Flux (F_max):** This occurs when we are looking at the unspotted hemisphere. The entire visible disk has a temperature of T_eff. The flux is proportional to T_eff⁴.\n        *   F_max ∝ T_eff⁴\n\n    *   **Minimum Flux (F_min):** This occurs when we are looking at the spotty hemisphere. The visible disk is a composite of two different temperatures:\n        *   A fraction `(1 - f)` of the area is at T_eff.\n        *   A fraction `f` of the area is at T_spot.\n        *   The total flux is a weighted average: F_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴.\n\n    *   **Amplitude of Variation:** The amplitude of the light curve signal is the relative change in flux, defined as (F_max - F_min) / F_max.\n        *   Amplitude_spot = [T_eff⁴ - ((1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴)] / T_eff⁴\n        *   Simplifying the numerator: T_eff⁴ - T_eff⁴ + f * T_eff⁴ - f * T_spot⁴ = f * (T_eff⁴ - T_spot⁴)\n        *   So, Amplitude_spot = [f * (T_eff⁴ - T_spot⁴)] / T_eff⁴\n        *   Further simplification gives: Amplitude_spot = f * (1 - T_spot⁴ / T_eff⁴) = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)\n\n3.  **Analyze Scenario 2: The Exoplanet Transit**\n    *   The dimming during a transit is caused by the planet blocking a portion of the star's light.\n    *   The amplitude of the transit signal is simply the ratio of the planet's projected area to the star's projected area.\n        *   Area_planet = π * R_pl²\n        *   Area_star = π * R_star²\n    *   Amplitude_transit = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\n4.  **Equate the two Amplitudes and Solve**\n    *   The problem states that the amplitudes of the two signals are the same.\n    *   Amplitude_spot = Amplitude_transit\n    *   f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴) = (R_pl / R_star)²\n    *   To find the relative radius (R_pl / R_star), we take the square root of both sides:\n    *   R_pl / R_star = sqrt[ f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴) ]\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation**\n    *   Now, I will substitute the given values into the equation. I'll use a Python script for precision.\n    *   f = 0.20\n    *   T_spot = 5000 K\n    *   T_eff = 6000 K\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given parameters\nf = 0.20  # Spot filling factor\nT_eff = 6000.0  # Effective temperature of the star in Kelvin\nT_spot = 5000.0  # Temperature of the spots in Kelvin\n\n# Calculate the amplitude of the signal due to the spots\n# Amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\namplitude_spot = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\n\n# The amplitude of a transit signal is (R_pl / R_star)**2\n# We set the two amplitudes equal to each other.\n# (R_pl / R_star)**2 = amplitude_spot\n# R_pl / R_star = sqrt(amplitude_spot)\nrelative_radius = math.sqrt(amplitude_spot)\n\nprint(relative_radius)\n```\n\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 0.322. Comparing this with the given options:\nA) ~0.32\nB) ~0.07\nC) ~0.39\nD) ~0.11\n\nThe calculated value is closest to 0.32.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem requires us to equate the amplitude of a light curve variation caused by stellar spots with the amplitude caused by an exoplanet transit.\n\n**1. Amplitude due to Stellar Spots:**\n\nThe flux (brightness) from a star is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature, according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law (F ∝ T⁴).\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (F_max):** This occurs when we observe the unspotted hemisphere. The entire visible disk is at the star's effective temperature (T_eff). So, F_max ∝ T_eff⁴.\n*   **Minimum Flux (F_min):** This occurs when we observe the spotty hemisphere. This hemisphere's flux is a combination of the unspotted part and the cooler spotted part.\n    *   The fraction of the area covered by spots is the filling factor, `f = 0.20`.\n    *   The fraction of the area that is unspotted is `1 - f = 0.80`.\n    *   The temperature of the spots is T_spot = T_eff - 1000K = 6000K - 1000K = 5000K.\n    *   The total flux from this hemisphere is a weighted average: F_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴.\n\nThe relative amplitude of the signal from the spots is the fractional change in flux:\n\nAmplitude_spot = (F_max - F_min) / F_max\nAmplitude_spot = [T_eff⁴ - ((1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴)] / T_eff⁴\nAmplitude_spot = [T_eff⁴ - T_eff⁴ + f * T_eff⁴ - f * T_spot⁴] / T_eff⁴\nAmplitude_spot = [f * (T_eff⁴ - T_spot⁴)] / T_eff⁴\nAmplitude_spot = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)\n\n**2. Amplitude due to an Exoplanet Transit:**\n\nThe amplitude of a transit signal is the fraction of the star's light that is blocked by the planet. This is equal to the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.\n\nAmplitude_planet = (Area_planet) / (Area_star)\nAmplitude_planet = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²)\nAmplitude_planet = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\n**3. Equating the Amplitudes and Solving:**\n\nThe problem states that the two signals have the same amplitude.\n\nAmplitude_planet = Amplitude_spot\n(R_pl / R_star)² = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)\n\nNow, we solve for the relative radius (R_pl / R_star):\n\nR_pl / R_star = sqrt[ f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴) ]\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n*   f = 0.20\n*   T_eff = 6000 K\n*   T_spot = 5000 K\n\nR_pl / R_star = sqrt[ 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴) ]\nR_pl / R_star = sqrt[ 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)⁴) ]\nR_pl / R_star = sqrt[ 0.20 * (1 - 0.48225) ]\nR_pl / R_star = sqrt[ 0.20 * 0.51775 ]\nR_pl / R_star = sqrt[ 0.10355 ]\nR_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\n<<<A>>>"
