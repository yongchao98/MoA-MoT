    "SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory. It is a theoretical framework that extends the Standard Model by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Lagrangian. These new operators are suppressed by a high energy scale, Î›, and represent the low-energy effects of some unknown new physics.\n\nTo determine which symmetries must be respected, we need to consider the fundamental principles upon which any quantum field theory, including SMEFT, is built.\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry:** The SMEFT, like the Standard Model, is a relativistic quantum field theory. A cornerstone of special relativity is Lorentz invariance, which means the laws of physics are the same for all observers in inertial frames. This symmetry must be preserved. All terms in the SMEFT Lagrangian, including the higher-dimensional operators, are constructed to be Lorentz scalars.\n\n2.  **Poincare symmetry:** This is the full symmetry of spacetime in special relativity. It includes Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts) and spacetime translations. Any local, relativistic quantum field theory must be invariant under Poincare transformations. The SMEFT is constructed to respect this fundamental symmetry. Since Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry, respecting Poincare symmetry implies respecting Lorentz symmetry.\n\n3.  **CP symmetry:** This is the combination of Charge Conjugation (C) and Parity (P). The Standard Model itself violates CP symmetry in the weak sector, as described by the CKM matrix. The SMEFT is designed to parameterize potential new physics, which may introduce additional sources of CP violation. In fact, many dimension-6 operators in the SMEFT explicitly violate CP symmetry. Therefore, CP symmetry is *not* a required symmetry for all operators in the SMEFT.\n\n4.  **CPT symmetry:** The CPT theorem is a fundamental result in quantum field theory. It states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be invariant under the combined operation of C, P, and Time Reversal (T). Since the SMEFT is constructed as a local and Lorentz-invariant theory, it must respect CPT symmetry. Every operator in the SMEFT is constructed to be CPT-invariant.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Lorentz symmetry (1) must be respected.\n- Poincare symmetry (2) must be respected.\n- CP symmetry (3) is not required to be respected.\n- CPT symmetry (4) must be respected due to the CPT theorem.\n\nTherefore, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry. This corresponds to options 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
