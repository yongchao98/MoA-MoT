    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the given information:**\n    *   **Molecular structure:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This implies a C6H4 core.\n    *   **FTIR spectrum:** Indicates the presence of an ester group (-COO-). An ester group contains two oxygen atoms.\n    *   **1H NMR spectrum:** Provides detailed information about the hydrogen atoms (protons) in the molecule.\n        *   \"six signals\": This means there are six chemically distinct types of protons.\n        *   \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\": A di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4) has 4 aromatic protons. Having two signals for these 4 protons is characteristic of a 1,4 (para) substitution pattern, which would show two doublets. Total aromatic protons = 4H.\n        *   \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\": This is a classic pattern for a `-CH=CH-CH3` group.\n            *   The proton on the carbon attached to the ring is split by the adjacent vinyl proton, resulting in a doublet.\n            *   The other vinyl proton is split by the first vinyl proton (giving a doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (giving a quartet). The combined splitting pattern is a doublet of quartets.\n            *   This fragment contains two vinyl protons (2H) and a methyl group (3H).\n        *   \"two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups\": We have already identified one methyl group from the propenyl fragment. The second methyl signal must come from the ester group. For it to be a simple methyl group signal and for the compound to have no -CH2- groups, the ester must be either a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate ester (`-OCOCH3`). Both possibilities add a methyl group (3H).\n        *   \"no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups\": This is a crucial constraint that eliminates many potential structures.\n\n2.  **Determine the total number of hydrogen atoms:**\n    Based on the 1H NMR data, we can sum the number of protons:\n    *   Aromatic protons: 4H\n    *   Vinyl protons: 2H\n    *   Methyl protons: There are two distinct methyl groups, so 2 * 3H = 6H.\n    *   **Total Hydrogens = 4 + 2 + 6 = 12H.**\n\n    This allows us to eliminate options with a different number of hydrogens.\n    *   A) C12H14O2 (14H) - Incorrect.\n    *   B) C11H12O2 (12H) - Possible.\n    *   C) C12H12O2 (12H) - Possible.\n    *   D) C11H14O2 (14H) - Incorrect.\n\n3.  **Determine the total number of carbon and oxygen atoms:**\n    Now we assemble the molecular fragments identified from the spectra and count the atoms to distinguish between the remaining options (B and C).\n    *   **Aromatic ring:** C6H4\n    *   **Propenyl group:** -CH=CH-CH3, which has the formula C3H5.\n    *   **Ester group part:** This part must contain the second methyl group.\n        *   Possibility 1: A methyl ester group, `-COOCH3`. This fragment contains C2H3O2.\n        *   Possibility 2: An acetate group, `-OCOCH3`. This fragment also contains C2H3O2.\n    *   **Assembling the full molecule:** The structure consists of the C6H4 ring substituted with the propenyl group (C3H5) and the ester part (C2H3O2).\n    *   **Total Carbon atoms** = 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5) + 2 (from C2H3O2) = **11 carbons**.\n    *   **Total Oxygen atoms** = **2 oxygens** (from the ester group).\n\n4.  **Conclude the molecular formula:**\n    Based on the atom count, the molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n    This matches option B and eliminates option C (C12H12O2).\n\n5.  **Final Verification (Degree of Unsaturation):**\n    The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is a useful check.\n    *   **DoU from formula (C11H12O2):** DoU = C + 1 - H/2 = 11 + 1 - 12/2 = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    *   **DoU from structure:** The proposed structure contains a benzene ring (DoU = 4), one C=C double bond (DoU = 1), and one C=O double bond (DoU = 1). Total DoU = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n    *   The DoU matches, confirming the consistency of the derived structure and formula.\n\nAll evidence points to the molecular formula being C11H12O2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
