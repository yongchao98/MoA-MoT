    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Process:** The problem describes a two-step radiative decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle = |3, 0, 0\\rangle$ to the final state $|n_f, l_f, m_f\\rangle = |1, 0, 0\\rangle$. The decay occurs via two consecutive electric dipole transitions. This is also known as a cascade decay.\n\n2.  **Recall Selection Rules:** Electric dipole transitions are governed by a set of selection rules for the quantum numbers:\n    *   Change in principal quantum number, $\\Delta n = n_{final} - n_{initial}$: can be any integer. For decay (emission), energy must decrease, so $n_{final} < n_{initial}$.\n    *   Change in orbital angular momentum quantum number, $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial}$: must be $\\pm 1$.\n    *   Change in magnetic quantum number, $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial}$: must be $0, \\pm 1$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Intermediate State:** Let the intermediate state be $|n', l', m'\\rangle$. We apply the selection rules to both steps of the cascade.\n\n    *   **First Transition: $|3, 0, 0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n', l', m'\\rangle$**\n        *   $\\Delta n = n' - 3 < 0 \\implies n' < 3$. So, $n'$ can be 1 or 2.\n        *   $\\Delta l = l' - 0 = \\pm 1 \\implies l' = 1$ (since $l'$ must be non-negative).\n        *   $\\Delta m = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1 \\implies m' = 0, 1, -1$.\n\n    *   **Second Transition: $|n', l', m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1, 0, 0\\rangle$**\n        *   $\\Delta n = 1 - n' < 0 \\implies n' > 1$.\n        *   $\\Delta l = 0 - l' = \\pm 1 \\implies l' = 1$. This is consistent with the first transition.\n        *   $\\Delta m = 0 - m' = 0, \\pm 1$. This implies that the initial $m'$ for this step could be $0, 1, -1$, which is also consistent.\n\n    *   **Combining the constraints on $n'$**: From the first transition, $n' < 3$. From the second, $n' > 1$. Therefore, the only possible value for the principal quantum number of the intermediate state is $n' = 2$.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for the intermediate state:** The intermediate state must be of the form $|2, 1, m'\\rangle$, where $m'$ can be $-1, 0, \\text{ or } 1$.\n\n4.  **Identify the Possible Decay Routes:** Based on the possible intermediate states, there are three distinct routes for the cascade decay:\n    *   **Route 1:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   **Route 2:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   **Route 3:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n    All the options in the question list one of these valid routes.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio):** The question asks for the probability associated with a specific route. In this context, this refers to the branching ratio: the fraction of decays from the initial state that proceed through that particular intermediate state. The branching ratio is determined by the relative rates of the first transition.\n\n    The rate of spontaneous emission (Einstein A coefficient) for a transition from an initial state $|i\\rangle$ to a final state $|f\\rangle$ is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element:\n    $A_{i \\rightarrow f} \\propto \\omega_{if}^3 |\\langle f | \\mathbf{d} | i \\rangle|^2$, where $\\mathbf{d} = -e\\mathbf{r}$ is the electric dipole operator.\n\n    We need to compare the rates for the three possible first transitions:\n    *   $A_0: |3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle$\n    *   $A_1: |3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle$\n    *   $A_{-1}: |3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle$\n\n    Since the energy difference (and thus the frequency $\\omega$) is the same for all three transitions (from $n=3$ to $n=2$), the relative rates are determined solely by the squared matrix elements $|\\langle 2,1,m' | \\mathbf{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$.\n\n    A key physical principle simplifies this calculation: The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has $l=0$, meaning it is spherically symmetric. There is no preferred direction in space. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to emit a photon in any direction, leading to any of the allowed final $m'$ states. The decay rates to the different magnetic sublevels $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ must be identical.\n\n    *   $A_0 = A_1 = A_{-1}$\n\n    Since there are three equally probable channels for the first decay step, the total rate is $A_{total} = A_0 + A_1 + A_{-1} = 3A_0$. The probability, or branching ratio, for any single channel (e.g., the one going through $|2,1,0\\rangle$) is:\n    $P(\\text{via } |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\frac{A_0}{A_{total}} = \\frac{A_0}{3A_0} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n    Similarly, the branching ratios for the other two routes are also $1/3$.\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The probability is incorrect.\n    *   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect (it should be $1/3$).\n    *   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect (it should be $1/3$).\n    *   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. The route is valid, and the calculated probability (branching ratio) is correct.\n\nTherefore, option D provides a valid transition route with the correct corresponding probability.\n\n<<<D>>>"
