    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant physical principle.**\n    The problem states that the stellar photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The question deals with the relative number of atoms in different energy levels (excitation). The physical law that governs this is the **Boltzmann distribution**.\n\n2.  **Write down the Boltzmann equation.**\n    The ratio of the number of atoms in a higher energy level 'b' (N_b) to the number of atoms in a lower energy level 'a' (N_a) is given by:\n    N_b / N_a = (g_b / g_a) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n    where:\n    *   g_b and g_a are the statistical weights of the levels.\n    *   ΔE is the energy difference between the levels (E_b - E_a).\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant (k ≈ 1.380649 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n    *   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Apply the equation to the two stars.**\n    Let R be the excitation ratio (N_b / N_a). Let C be the constant term (g_b / g_a), which is the same for the same transition in both stars.\n\n    For star_1 with temperature T_1:\n    R_1 = C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))\n\n    For star_2 with temperature T_2:\n    R_2 = C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\n4.  **Use the condition given in the problem.**\n    The problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... when compared to the iron atoms in star_2\". This means the excitation ratio for star_1 is twice that for star_2:\n    R_1 = 2 * R_2\n\n5.  **Substitute the Boltzmann expressions and solve for the temperatures.**\n    C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * [ C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ]\n\n    The constant C cancels out:\n    exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\n    To solve for the temperatures, we can take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides of the equation:\n    ln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))] = ln[2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))]\n\n    Using the logarithm properties ln(e^x) = x and ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b):\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))]\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\n    Now, rearrange the terms to isolate ln(2):\n    ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2)\n\n    Factor out the common term (ΔE / k):\n    (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)\n\n    Combine the fractions inside the parenthesis:\n    (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)\n\n    Substitute this back into the equation:\n    (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n\n6.  **Analyze the constants and numerical values.**\n    The problem provides the energy difference: ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J.\n    The Boltzmann constant is k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K.\n\n    Let's calculate the value of the pre-factor (ΔE / k):\n    (ΔE / k) ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) ≈ 1 K.\n\n    The derived equation is therefore approximately:\n    (1 K) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n\n7.  **Compare with the given options.**\n    The options are:\n    A) ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\n    B) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n    C) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n    D) ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n\n    Our derived relationship has the algebraic form `[ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]`, which matches option B. The options omit the constant factor (ΔE / k). This is a common simplification in physics problems where the constants are chosen to have a numerical value of 1. We are intended to notice that ΔE is numerically equal to k, making the factor ΔE/k numerically equal to 1, and select the option with the correct algebraic form.\n\nTherefore, the correct equation, under the assumptions of the problem, is the one presented in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
