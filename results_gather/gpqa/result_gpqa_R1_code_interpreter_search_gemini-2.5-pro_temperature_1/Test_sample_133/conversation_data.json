    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Reaction**\n\nThe problem involves the mixing of strong acids (HCl and H2SO4) with a strong base (Ba(OH)2). The fundamental reaction is the neutralization of H+ ions from the acids with OH- ions from the base to form water. The net ionic equation for the neutralization of a strong acid and a strong base is:\nH+(aq) + OH-(aq) → H2O(l)\n\nThe enthalpy change for this reaction, known as the enthalpy of neutralization, is approximately -57.1 kJ/mol or -13.6 to -13.7 kcal/mol for the formation of one mole of water.\n\n**2. Calculate the Moles of H+ Ions**\n\nWe need to find the total moles of H+ ions contributed by both acids.\n\n*   **From HCl:**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.2 M\n    *   HCl is a monoprotic acid (provides 1 H+ per molecule).\n    *   Moles of H+ from HCl = Molarity × Volume = 0.2 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.10 mol H+\n\n*   **From H2SO4:**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.3 M\n    *   H2SO4 is a diprotic acid (provides 2 H+ per molecule).\n    *   Moles of H2SO4 = Molarity × Volume = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.09 mol H2SO4\n    *   Moles of H+ from H2SO4 = 2 × 0.09 mol = 0.18 mol H+\n\n*   **Total Moles of H+:**\n    *   Total moles H+ = (moles from HCl) + (moles from H2SO4) = 0.10 mol + 0.18 mol = 0.28 mol H+\n\n**3. Calculate the Moles of OH- Ions**\n\nNow, we calculate the moles of OH- ions from the base.\n\n*   **From Ba(OH)2:**\n    *   Volume = 200 mL = 0.200 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.5 M\n    *   Ba(OH)2 provides 2 OH- ions per formula unit.\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 = Molarity × Volume = 0.5 mol/L × 0.200 L = 0.10 mol Ba(OH)2\n    *   Moles of OH- = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol OH-\n\n**4. Identify the Limiting Reactant**\n\nThe neutralization reaction proceeds based on the stoichiometry H+ + OH- → H2O. We compare the moles of H+ and OH- to see which one will be completely consumed.\n\n*   Moles of H+ = 0.28 mol\n*   Moles of OH- = 0.20 mol\n\nSince there are fewer moles of OH- than H+, the **OH- ions are the limiting reactant**. The reaction will stop once all the OH- ions are consumed. The number of moles of water formed will be equal to the moles of the limiting reactant.\n\n*   **Moles of H2O formed = 0.20 mol**\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Enthalpy of Neutralization**\n\nThe total heat released is the moles of water formed multiplied by the standard enthalpy of neutralization per mole. We will use the value in kcal/mol since most options are in kcal. The standard value is approximately -13.6 kcal/mol.\n\n*   Enthalpy Change (ΔH) = Moles of H2O formed × Enthalpy of neutralization per mole\n*   ΔH = 0.20 mol × (-13.6 kcal/mol)\n*   ΔH = -2.72 kcal\n\nThis value matches option A exactly. Let's also calculate it in kJ to check against option D.\n\n*   ΔH = 0.20 mol × (-57.1 kJ/mol)\n*   ΔH = -11.42 kJ\n\nThis shows that option D (-16.0 kJ) is incorrect. The value in option B (-11.42 kcal) has the correct number but the wrong unit; it should be kJ.\n\nTherefore, the calculated enthalpy of neutralization is -2.72 kcal.\n\n<<<A>>>"
