    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the System's Properties**\n\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. In quantum mechanics, particles with half-integer spin (like 1/2, 3/2, etc.) are called **fermions**.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** A key rule for fermions is the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. For an electron in a potential well, a quantum state is defined by its energy level (principal quantum number *n*) and its spin (spin quantum number *m_s*).\n*   **Spin States:** Since the particles are spin-1/2, each particle can have one of two spin states: spin up (m_s = +1/2) or spin down (m_s = -1/2).\n*   **Conclusion from Pauli Principle:** This means that for any given energy level *n*, we can place at most two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n**2. Define the Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\n*   The system is a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. The energy levels for a single particle in such a well are quantized and given by the formula:\n    E_n = (n^2 * π² * ħ²) / (2mL²)\n    where *n* is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...), *m* is the mass of the particle, and *ħ* is the reduced Planck constant.\n*   The problem conveniently defines a base unit of energy:\n    E = (π² * ħ²) / (2mL²)\n*   Therefore, we can express the single-particle energy levels in terms of E:\n    *   E₁ = 1² * E = E\n    *   E₂ = 2² * E = 4E\n    *   E₃ = 3² * E = 9E\n    *   E₄ = 4² * E = 16E\n    *   and so on...\n\n**3. Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_ground)**\n\nThe ground state is the state with the lowest possible total energy. To achieve this, we must fill the energy levels from the bottom up, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   **Level n=1 (Energy E₁ = E):** We can place two particles here (one spin up, one spin down).\n*   **Level n=2 (Energy E₂ = 4E):** We have two particles left. We place them in the next available level, n=2 (one spin up, one spin down).\n*   **Total Energy:** The total energy is the sum of the energies of all four particles.\n    E_ground = (2 particles × E₁) + (2 particles × E₂)\n    E_ground = (2 × E) + (2 × 4E) = 2E + 8E = **10E**\n\n**4. Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_1st)**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest energy *above* the ground state. We find this by promoting one particle from the highest occupied level to the lowest unoccupied level.\n\n*   **Ground State Configuration:** Particles are in n=1 and n=2.\n*   **Highest Occupied Level:** n=2.\n*   **Lowest Unoccupied Level:** n=3.\n*   **Promotion:** Move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n*   **New Configuration:**\n    *   Level n=1: Two particles.\n    *   Level n=2: One particle.\n    *   Level n=3: One particle.\n*   **Total Energy:**\n    E_1st = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃)\n    E_1st = (2 × E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**\n\n**5. Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next-lowest energy. We must consider different ways to excite the system from the ground state and find the one with the lowest energy after the first excited state.\n\nLet's list the possible low-energy configurations and their total energies:\n*   **Ground State:** {n=1(2), n=2(2)} -> Energy = 10E\n*   **First Excitation:** {n=1(2), n=2(1), n=3(1)} -> Energy = 2(E) + 1(4E) + 1(9E) = 15E. (This is the First Excited State).\n*   **Next Possible Excitation:** Consider promoting a particle from n=1 to n=3 (while keeping the n=2 level full).\n    *   Configuration: {n=1(1), n=2(2), n=3(1)}\n    *   Energy = 1(E) + 2(4E) + 1(9E) = E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n*   **Another Possible Excitation:** Consider promoting both particles from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: {n=1(2), n=3(2)}\n    *   Energy = 2(E) + 2(9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n\nComparing the energies of the excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, ...), the second-lowest energy is 18E.\n\n**Summary of Energies:**\n*   Ground State: 10E\n*   First Excited State: 15E\n*   Second Excited State: 18E\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
