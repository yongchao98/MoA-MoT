    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   The substrate is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene molecule substituted with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen, D) at position 2.\n    *   The reagent is sodium amide (NaNH₂) dissolved in liquid ammonia (NH₃). NaNH₂ is an extremely strong base (the amide ion, NH₂⁻, is the active species).\n    *   This combination of an aryl halide and a very strong base is characteristic of an **elimination-addition reaction** that proceeds through a **benzyne intermediate**.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of the Benzyne Intermediate)**\n    *   The amide ion (NH₂⁻) acts as a base and abstracts an acidic proton from a carbon atom adjacent (ortho) to the carbon bearing the leaving group (bromine).\n    *   In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions relative to the bromine at C-1:\n        *   Position C-2, which has a deuterium atom (D).\n        *   Position C-6, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   Since both hydrogen and deuterium can be abstracted by the strong base, two different elimination pathways are possible, leading to two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of Hydrogen from C-6**\n        1.  The amide ion (NH₂⁻) removes the proton (H⁺) from C-6.\n        2.  The resulting negative charge on C-6 triggers the elimination of the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C-1.\n        3.  A triple bond is formed between C-1 and C-6. The deuterium atom at C-2 remains in the molecule.\n        4.  This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n         \n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of Deuteron from C-2**\n        1.  The amide ion (NH₂⁻) removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C-2. (Note: The C-D bond is stronger than the C-H bond, so this pathway is slower due to the kinetic isotope effect, but it is still a possible pathway).\n        2.  The resulting negative charge on C-2 triggers the elimination of the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C-1.\n        3.  A triple bond is formed between C-1 and C-2. The deuterium atom is removed from the molecule in this process.\n        4.  This intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n         \n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    *   The amide ion (NH₂⁻) now acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH₃).\n\n    *   **Products from Intermediate from Pathway A (3-deuterobenzyne)**\n        *   The triple bond is between C-1 and C-6. The nucleophile NH₂⁻ can attack either carbon.\n        *   **Attack at C-1:** The NH₂ group adds to C-1. The carbanion forms at C-6. Protonation of C-6 by NH₃ yields a product with the -NH₂ group at C-1 and the deuterium at C-2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        *   **Attack at C-6:** The NH₂ group adds to C-6. The carbanion forms at C-1. Protonation of C-1 by NH₃ yields a product with the -NH₂ group at C-6 and the deuterium at C-2. If we renumber the ring so that the carbon with the -NH₂ group is C-1, the deuterium is now at C-3. This product is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n        *   So, Pathway A leads to two distinct products.\n\n    *   **Products from Intermediate from Pathway B (Benzyne)**\n        *   The triple bond is between C-1 and C-2, and there is no deuterium.\n        *   **Attack at C-1 or C-2:** The NH₂⁻ group can attack either C-1 or C-2. Regardless of which carbon is attacked, after protonation by NH₃, the final product is the same: **aniline** (C₆H₅NH₂), which contains no deuterium.\n        *   So, Pathway B leads to one distinct product.\n\n4.  **Conclusion: Counting the Total Possible Products**\n    *   By considering all possible pathways, we have identified three unique organic products:\n        1.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n        2.  **2-Deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n        3.  **3-Deuteroaniline** (from Pathway A)\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>"
