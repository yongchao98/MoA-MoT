    "### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the Initial State:** The system consists of two electrons, each in a p-orbital. For a p-orbital, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=1$.\n    *   Electron 1: $l_1 = 1$. The possible magnetic quantum numbers are $m_1 \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   Electron 2: $l_2 = 1$. The possible magnetic quantum numbers are $m_2 \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    The system is in a specific coupled angular momentum state, denoted by $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n    *   $l_1 = 1$ is the orbital quantum number for electron 1.\n    *   $l_2 = 1$ is the orbital quantum number for electron 2.\n    *   $l = 2$ is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the two-electron system.\n    *   $m = -1$ is the total magnetic quantum number, which is the projection of the total orbital angular momentum onto the z-axis.\n\n2.  **Understand the Measurement:** A measurement of the individual orbital angular momentum components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ is performed.\n    *   The operator $L_{1z}$ acts on electron 1, and its eigenvalues are $m_1\\hbar$.\n    *   The operator $L_{2z}$ acts on electron 2, and its eigenvalues are $m_2\\hbar$.\n    We are asked for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ as $-\\hbar$ and the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ corresponds to finding electron 1 in the state with $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ corresponds to finding electron 2 in the state with $m_2 = -1$.\n    So, we need to find the probability of observing the outcome $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, -1)$.\n\n3.  **Apply Fundamental Principles:** The key principle here is the relationship between the total magnetic quantum number ($m$) and the individual magnetic quantum numbers ($m_1$, $m_2$). The operator for the total z-component of angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-component operators:\n    $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$\n    The coupled state $|l, m>$ is an eigenstate of $L_z$ with eigenvalue $m\\hbar$. The uncoupled states $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2>$ (often written as $|m_1, m_2>$ for brevity when $l_1, l_2$ are known) are eigenstates of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ with eigenvalues $m_1\\hbar$ and $m_2\\hbar$ respectively.\n    When acting on an uncoupled state, the $L_z$ operator gives:\n    $L_z |m_1, m_2> = (L_{1z} + L_{2z})|m_1, m_2> = (m_1\\hbar + m_2\\hbar)|m_1, m_2> = (m_1+m_2)\\hbar|m_1, m_2>$\n    The coupled state $|l, m>$ can be expressed as a linear combination of the uncoupled states $|m_1, m_2>$:\n    $|l, m> = \\sum_{m_1, m_2} C_{m_1, m_2} |m_1, m_2>$\n    where the coefficients $C_{m_1, m_2}$ are the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n    For this expansion to be valid, applying $L_z$ to both sides must yield the same result.\n    $L_z|l, m> = m\\hbar|l, m> = m\\hbar \\sum_{m_1, m_2} C_{m_1, m_2} |m_1, m_2>$\n    $L_z \\left(\\sum_{m_1, m_2} C_{m_1, m_2} |m_1, m_2>\\right) = \\sum_{m_1, m_2} C_{m_1, m_2} (L_z|m_1, m_2>) = \\sum_{m_1, m_2} C_{m_1, m_2} (m_1+m_2)\\hbar |m_1, m_2>$\n    Comparing the two expressions, we see that for any term in the sum with a non-zero coefficient $C_{m_1, m_2}$, it must be that:\n    $m = m_1 + m_2$\n    This is a fundamental selection rule for the addition of angular momenta.\n\n4.  **Solve the Specific Problem:**\n    *   The system is in the state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$, so the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n    *   We are looking for the probability of the measurement outcome $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, -1)$.\n    *   Let's check if this outcome is consistent with the selection rule: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   The initial state has $m=-1$, but the desired final state has a combined $m_1+m_2 = -2$.\n    *   Since $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$ (i.e., $-1 \\neq -2$), the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for this component, $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>$, is zero.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Probability:** The probability of measuring a specific outcome $(m_1, m_2)$ is the square of the magnitude of the coefficient of the corresponding state $|m_1, m_2>$ in the expansion of the system's state vector.\n    Probability $P(m_1=-1, m_2=-1) = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>|^2$\n    Since the coefficient is 0, the probability is $0^2 = 0$.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** It is impossible to measure the individual z-components of angular momentum to be $m_1=-1$ and $m_2=-1$ if the system is in a state with a total z-component of $m=-1$. The sum of the parts must equal the whole. Therefore, the joint probability is 0.\n\n(Optional) **Verification using Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients:**\nThe expansion of the state $|l=2, m=-1>$ in the uncoupled basis $|m_1, m_2>$ is given by:\n$|2, -1> = \\sum_{m_1+m_2=-1} <1, m_1; 1, m_2 | 2, -1> |m_1, m_2>$\nThe only possible pairs $(m_1, m_2)$ that sum to -1 are $(0, -1)$ and $(-1, 0)$.\nThe actual expansion is:\n$|2, -1> = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}|1, 0; 1, -1> + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}|1, -1; 1, 0>$\nAs we can see from this expansion, the state $|1, -1; 1, -1>$ is not a component of the state $|2, -1>$. Its coefficient is zero. Thus, the probability of measuring the system in this state is 0.\n\n<<<C>>>"
