    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the experimental context.** The experiment involves administering an antigen (rotavirus capsid protein) orally. This mimics a natural infection of the gut. The immune response is being observed in the Peyer's patches, which are the primary sites for initiating immune responses to intestinal antigens.\n*   **Step 2: Identify the key observation.** The crucial finding is that proliferating cells isolated from the Peyer's patches show \"high variability\" in their \"variable heavy chain gene\". These cells are clearly responding to the antigen, as they were isolated from fluorescent patches (meaning they have taken up the GFP-tagged protein or are interacting with cells that have) and are proliferating.\n*   **Step 3: Evaluate the provided options in the context of B cell immunology.** The question is asking for the process that generates variability in the variable region of an immunoglobulin gene *after* antigen encounter in a secondary lymphoid organ.\n    *   **A) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a process that occurs in activated B cells within the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches). It introduces point mutations into the variable regions of the immunoglobulin genes (both heavy and light chains). The purpose of SHM is to fine-tune the antibody response, selecting for B cells that produce antibodies with higher affinity for the antigen. This process directly leads to \"high variability\" in the variable heavy chain gene among the population of proliferating, antigen-specific B cells. This perfectly matches the observations.\n    *   **B) Complement activation:** This is a component of the innate immune system involving a cascade of plasma proteins. It does not involve genetic changes in B cells and is therefore incorrect.\n    *   **C) V(D)J recombination:** This is the genetic recombination process that assembles the variable region genes from V, D, and J gene segments. This process creates the initial, vast repertoire of B cell receptors. However, it occurs in the bone marrow during the development of B cells, *before* they encounter an antigen. The process described in the question is happening in mature B cells in a secondary lymphoid organ *after* encountering an antigen. Therefore, V(D)J recombination is incorrect.\n    *   **D) Class switching recombination (CSR):** This process also occurs in activated B cells within germinal centers, often at the same time as somatic hypermutation. However, CSR changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain, not the *variable* region. This switches the antibody isotype (e.g., from IgM to IgA, which is common in mucosal responses), thereby altering the antibody's effector function, but it does not change its antigen-binding specificity or create variability in the variable region. The question specifically states variability was found in the \"variable heavy chain gene\".\n\n*   **Step 4: Conclude the best fit.** The process that specifically introduces high variability into the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating B cells in a secondary lymphoid organ following antigen stimulation is somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<A>>>"
