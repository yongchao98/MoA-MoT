Optical isomerism is a property of chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicators of chirality are the presence of a chiral center (an atom bonded to four different groups) or the absence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion in the molecule's stable conformation.\n\n2.  **Analyze Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl compound. The two phenyl rings are joined by a single C-C bond.\n    *   **Substituents:** The positions ortho to the inter-ring bond (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are all substituted.\n        *   At positions 2 and 2', there are dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3).\n        *   At positions 6 and 6', there are nitro groups (-NO2).\n    *   **Chirality Check:** In biphenyls, if there are bulky substituents at the ortho positions, they can clash with each other, preventing free rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings. This restricted rotation is called \"atropisomerism\".\n    *   The nitro (-NO2) and dimethyl carboxylate (-COOCH3) groups are sufficiently bulky to hinder rotation. This locks the two phenyl rings in a non-planar (twisted) conformation.\n    *   Next, we check for symmetry. In this twisted conformation, there is no plane of symmetry that can cut the molecule into two identical halves, nor is there a center of inversion.\n    *   Because the molecule is non-planar and lacks these symmetry elements, it is chiral. Chiral molecules can exist as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers) and thus exhibit optical isomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Compound 1 shows optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyze Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** Let's break down the name. \"Propanoate\" indicates a 3-carbon chain with a carboxylate group. \"Methyl\" means it's an ester with a methyl group (CH3O-). \"2-hydroxy\" means an -OH group is on carbon-2. The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. This compound is also known as methyl lactate.\n    *   **Chirality Check:** We look for a chiral center. A chiral center is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   Let's examine Carbon-2 (the one with the -OH group):\n        1.  It is bonded to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n        2.  It is bonded to a methyl group (-CH3).\n        3.  It is bonded to a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3).\n        4.  It is bonded to a hydrogen atom (-H).\n    *   Since Carbon-2 is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center.\n    *   A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Compound 2 shows optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **Analyze Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** The structure is C6H5-C(=O)-C6H5. It's a ketone with two phenyl groups attached to the carbonyl carbon.\n    *   **Chirality Check:**\n        *   There is no carbon atom with four different single-bonded substituents, so there is no chiral center.\n        *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry. A plane can be imagined passing through the C=O bond and bisecting the angle between the two phenyl rings. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   The molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Compound 3 does not show optical isomerism.\n\n5.  **Analyze Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** Fumarate is the trans-isomer of butenedioate. Dimethyl fumarate is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, where the two ester groups (-COOCH3) are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Chirality Check:**\n        *   There are no chiral centers.\n        *   The molecule is planar. The plane of the molecule itself is a plane of symmetry. It also possesses a center of inversion (a point in the middle of the C=C bond).\n    *   The molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Compound 4 does not show optical isomerism.\n\n6.  **Synthesize the Final Answer:**\n    *   Compound 1 is optically active (due to atropisomerism).\n    *   Compound 2 is optically active (due to a chiral center).\n    *   Compound 3 is not optically active (achiral).\n    *   Compound 4 is not optically active (achiral).\n\n    Therefore, the compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism:**\n    Optical isomerism is a type of stereoisomerism where a molecule is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. For a molecule to be chiral, it must lack any improper axis of rotation (S_n), which includes planes of symmetry (S_1) and centers of inversion (S_2). The most common features leading to chirality are:\n    1.  **Chiral Center:** An atom (usually carbon) bonded to four different groups.\n    2.  **Axial Chirality:** Chirality arising from restricted rotation around a single bond, as seen in some substituted biphenyls (atropisomers), allenes, and spiranes.\n    3.  **Planar Chirality:** Chirality arising from a plane in the molecule, as seen in compounds like ansa compounds or trans-cyclooctene.\n\n*   **Evaluation of each compound:**\n\n    1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:**\n        *   This is a biphenyl compound substituted at all four ortho-positions (positions 2, 6, 2', and 6').\n        *   The substituents are nitro groups (-NO2) and dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3). These are bulky groups.\n        *   The steric hindrance caused by these bulky ortho-substituents prevents free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This phenomenon is called atropisomerism.\n        *   Because rotation is restricted, the molecule is locked into a specific conformation. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion.\n        *   As a result, it is not superimposable on its mirror image. This is a classic example of axial chirality.\n        *   Therefore, this compound is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n    2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n        *   The chemical formula is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃.\n        *   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the hydroxyl group, -OH).\n        *   This carbon atom is bonded to four different groups:\n            1.  a hydrogen atom (-H)\n            2.  a hydroxyl group (-OH)\n            3.  a methyl group (-CH₃)\n            4.  a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n        *   Since this carbon is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center (or stereocenter).\n        *   The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral.\n        *   Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism (existing as R- and S-enantiomers).\n\n    3.  **benzophenone:**\n        *   The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. A central carbonyl group is bonded to two phenyl rings.\n        *   The molecule does not have a chiral center. The central carbon is sp² hybridized.\n        *   The molecule possesses elements of symmetry. It has a C₂ rotational axis passing through the C=O bond. Even in its twisted, low-energy conformation, its mirror image is superimposable upon the original molecule.\n        *   Therefore, benzophenone is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n    4.  **dimethyl fumarate:**\n        *   This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid (trans-butenedioic acid).\n        *   Its structure is trans-CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n        *   The molecule is planar. This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry.\n        *   Additionally, the molecule has a center of inversion (or center of symmetry) located at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n        *   A molecule with a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is achiral.\n        *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    Based on the analysis, compounds 1 (due to axial chirality/atropisomerism) and 2 (due to a chiral center) are chiral and will show optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral.\n\nThus, the correct option includes only 1 and 2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\n**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the question:** The user wants to identify which of the four given organic compounds can exhibit optical isomerism.\n2.  **Define Optical Isomerism:** Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is **chiral**. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups), but other sources exist, such as axial chirality (atropisomerism). A key test for chirality is the absence of any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. If a molecule has either of these symmetry elements, it is **achiral** and will not be optically active.\n\n3.  **Analyze each compound:**\n\n    *   **1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:**\n        *   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl. The two phenyl rings are joined by a single C-C bond.\n        *   **Key Feature:** The positions ortho to the linking bond (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are all substituted with large groups: two nitro groups (-NO2) and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3).\n        *   **Chirality Analysis:** These large groups cause significant steric hindrance, which prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the central single bond. This restricted rotation forces the rings to be non-coplanar. The resulting twisted conformation lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. This type of chirality, arising from hindered rotation about a single bond, is called **atropisomerism**. Since the molecule is chiral, it will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n        *   **Structure:** This is an ester, commonly known as methyl lactate. Its chemical formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n        *   **Key Feature:** Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2, which is bonded to the hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n        *   **Chirality Analysis:** This carbon atom is bonded to four different groups:\n            1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n            2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n            3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n            4.  A methyl carboxylate group (-COOCH3)\n        *   Since this carbon is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a **chiral center** (or stereocenter). The presence of a single chiral center in a molecule makes it chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will exhibit optical isomerism (existing as R and S enantiomers).\n\n    *   **3. benzophenone:**\n        *   **Structure:** This is a ketone with the formula (C6H5)2CO or Ph-C(=O)-Ph.\n        *   **Key Feature:** The central carbon is part of a carbonyl group (C=O), so it's sp2 hybridized and bonded to only three groups (two phenyl rings and one oxygen). It cannot be a chiral center.\n        *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule possesses a **plane of symmetry**. Imagine a plane cutting through the C=O bond and bisecting the angle between the two phenyl rings. The left half of the molecule is a mirror image of the right half. Because it has a plane of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and cannot exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **4. dimethyl fumarate:**\n        *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans* isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is trans-CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3.\n        *   **Key Feature:** It is a planar molecule due to the C=C double bond.\n        *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is highly symmetrical. It possesses a **center of inversion** at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. It also has a **plane of symmetry** (the plane of the molecule itself). The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate will not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Compound 1 is chiral (atropisomerism).\n    *   Compound 2 is chiral (chiral center).\n    *   Compound 3 is achiral (plane of symmetry).\n    *   Compound 4 is achiral (center of inversion and plane of symmetry).\n\n    Therefore, the compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nAn organic compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Let's analyze each compound to determine if it is chiral.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl derivative. In biphenyl systems, if the four ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6') are occupied by bulky substituents, the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is hindered due to steric strain.\n    *   **Analysis:** In this molecule, all four ortho positions are substituted with large groups: two nitro groups (-NO2) at positions 6 and 6', and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3) at positions 2 and 2'. This steric hindrance prevents the two rings from becoming coplanar. The molecule is forced into a stable, twisted conformation. This molecule lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. As a result, it is chiral and its mirror image is non-superimposable. This type of stereoisomerism is called atropisomerism, which is a form of axial chirality.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** The chemical structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. This is an ester commonly known as methyl lactate.\n    *   **Analysis:** To check for chirality, we look for asymmetric carbon atoms (chiral centers). A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Let's examine carbon-2 (the carbon atom bearing the hydroxyl group):\n        *   It is bonded to a hydrogen atom (-H).\n        *   It is bonded to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n        *   It is bonded to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n        *   It is bonded to a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃).\n        Since all four groups attached to carbon-2 are different, it is a chiral center.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a chiral center makes the molecule chiral, and therefore it shows optical isomerism. It exists as two enantiomers (R and S forms).\n\n3.  **benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. It consists of a carbonyl group bonded to two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Analysis:** The central carbon atom is sp² hybridized, bonded to only three groups (one oxygen and two phenyl rings), so it cannot be a chiral center. The molecule possesses elements of symmetry. For instance, there is a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is an achiral molecule and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   **Analysis:** The molecule is planar. It possesses both a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and a center of inversion (the midpoint of the C=C double bond). The presence of any element of symmetry like a plane or center of symmetry makes a molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is an achiral molecule and does not show optical isomerism. (Note: It does show geometric isomerism with its *cis*-isomer, dimethyl maleate).\n\nBased on the analysis, compounds 1 and 2 are chiral and will show optical isomerism, while compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and will not.\n\nTherefore, the correct option includes 1 and 2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere's a breakdown of each compound to determine if it exhibits optical isomerism:\n\n**Optical Isomerism**\nA compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is **chiral**. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality are:\n1.  The presence of a **chiral center** (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups).\n2.  The presence of **axial chirality**, where rotation around a bond is restricted, leading to a structure that lacks a plane of symmetry (e.g., atropisomerism in biphenyls).\n\nLet's analyze each molecule:\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl. The two phenyl rings are connected by a single carbon-carbon bond.\n*   **Analysis:** The positions ortho to the connecting bond (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are all substituted with large, bulky groups (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃). These bulky groups sterically hinder each other, preventing free rotation around the single bond that connects the two phenyl rings. This restricted rotation forces the rings to be twisted out of the same plane. In this twisted, non-planar conformation, the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. This phenomenon is called **atropisomerism**, which is a form of axial chirality.\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral and will show optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Structure:** The chemical formula is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃.\n*   **Analysis:** Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2), which is bonded to the hydroxyl (-OH) group.

A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the central carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a **chiral center**. Molecules with a single chiral center are always chiral. Therefore, it will show optical isomerism.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n*   **Structure:** The chemical formula is (C₆H₅)₂CO. It consists of a carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two phenyl rings.\n*   **Analysis:** The molecule is symmetrical.

A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common features that lead to chirality are:\n1.  **Chiral Center (Asymmetric Carbon):** A carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n2.  **Axial Chirality (Atropisomerism):** Chirality arising from restricted rotation around a single bond, typically seen in substituted biphenyl compounds.\n3.  **Absence of Symmetry Elements:** Chiral molecules lack a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion.\n\nLet's examine each compound:\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl derivative. The two phenyl rings are connected by a single bond.\n*   **Analysis:** The key to chirality in biphenyls is restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the rings. This restriction, known as atropisomerism, occurs when there are bulky substituents at the *ortho* positions (the positions next to the connecting bond: 2, 6, 2', and 6').\n*   In this molecule, all four *ortho* positions are substituted:\n    *   Positions 2 and 2' have bulky methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH₃).\n    *   Positions 6 and 6' have bulky nitro groups (-NO₂).\n*   These large groups physically block the free rotation around the central C-C bond. This forces the two phenyl rings to be in different planes (non-coplanar). The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it non-superimposable on its mirror image.\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule is chiral due to atropisomerism and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (Methyl lactate)**\n*   **Structure:** CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃\n*   **Analysis:** We need to check for chiral centers. Let's look at the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group).\n*   This carbon atom is bonded to four different groups:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n*   Since the carbon at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center.\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral, and thus it exhibits optical isomerism. It exists as two enantiomers (R- and S-methyl lactate).\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n*   **Structure:** (C₆H₅)₂C=O. It consists of two phenyl rings attached to a central carbonyl carbon.\n*   **Analysis:** The central carbon atom is sp² hybridized and is only bonded to three groups (two phenyl rings, one oxygen). It cannot be a chiral center. The molecule as a whole is symmetric. It has a plane of symmetry that runs through the C=O bond, bisecting the molecule.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the molecule possesses a plane of symmetry, it is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism. It is superimposable on its mirror image.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is *trans*-CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n*   **Analysis:** The molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond. There are no chiral centers. The molecule has both a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and a center of inversion (at the midpoint of the C=C double bond).\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral. It does not exhibit optical isomerism. It does, however, have a geometric isomer (dimethyl maleate, the *cis*-isomer), but neither is optically active.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n*   Molecule 1: Shows optical isomerism (chiral).\n*   Molecule 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral).\n*   Molecule 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n*   Molecule 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nTherefore, the correct compounds are 1 and 2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\n**1. Analysis of dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl compound. The structure consists of two phenyl rings linked by a carbon-carbon single bond. There are substituents at the positions ortho to this bond (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). Specifically, two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH3) are at positions 2 and 2', and two nitro groups (-NO2) are at positions 6 and 6'.\n*   **Source of Chirality (Atropisomerism):** In biphenyl systems, if there are bulky substituents at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6'), they can sterically hinder the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restricted rotation can lock the molecule into a non-planar, twisted conformation.\n*   **Chirality Check:** For this specific molecule, all four ortho positions are substituted with bulky groups (-NO2 and -COOCH3). This severely restricts rotation. The resulting twisted conformation lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, making it non-superimposable on its mirror image. This phenomenon is called atropisomerism, which is a type of axial chirality. Therefore, this compound is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**2. Analysis of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\n*   **Structure:** The chemical name describes an ester derived from 2-hydroxypropanoic acid (lactic acid) and methanol. Its structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n*   **Source of Chirality (Chiral Center):** A common source of chirality in organic molecules is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n*   **Chirality Check:** Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl group).

The two phenyl rings are linked by a C-C single bond. The positions ortho to this bond (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are occupied by bulky groups: nitro (-NO₂) and dimethyl carboxylate (-COOCH₃). These bulky groups hinder the free rotation around the C-C single bond connecting the rings. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, forces the two rings to be in different planes. Because the substitution pattern on each ring is asymmetric, the molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. It is therefore chiral and will have a non-superimposable mirror image. Thus, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n    2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: This molecule is an ester commonly known as methyl lactate. Its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.

The two phenyl rings are joined by a single C-C bond.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:** Biphenyl compounds can exhibit a type of stereoisomerism called **atropisomerism**.

This is often because it lacks any elements of symmetry like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n*   The benzophenone molecule is not planar in its lowest energy state due to steric interactions between the phenyl rings, but the barrier to rotation around the C-C bonds is very low, allowing for rapid interconversion between twisted conformations at room temperature.\n*   More importantly, the molecule can easily adopt a conformation that has a plane of symmetry.

The substitution pattern here (nitro at 6, 6' and ester at 2, 2') results in a twisted structure that is not superimposable on its mirror image.\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\n*   **Structure:** The chemical formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. This is the methyl ester of lactic acid.\n*   **Chirality Source:** This molecule contains a potential stereocenter. A stereocenter (or chiral center) is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n*   **Analysis:** Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bearing the hydroxyl group). It is bonded to:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the carbon at position 2 is attached to four different groups, it is a stereocenter. A molecule with one stereocenter is always chiral (unless it's part of a meso compound, which is not the case here). Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exhibits optical isomerism, existing as a pair of enantiomers (R and S forms).\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n\n*   **Structure:** The chemical formula is (C6H5)2CO. It is a ketone where the carbonyl carbon is attached to two phenyl rings.\n*   **Chirality Source:** We check for stereocenters and overall molecular symmetry.\n*   **Analysis:** There are no stereocenters in the molecule. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that contains the C=O group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans* isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The structure has a C=C double bond with a -COOCH3 group and a -H on each carbon, arranged in a *trans* configuration.\n*   **Chirality Source:** We check for stereocenters and overall molecular symmetry.\n*   **Analysis:** The molecule is planar. Any planar molecule possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself), which makes it achiral. Additionally, dimethyl fumarate has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. The presence of either a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion renders a molecule achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n*   **1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:** Shows optical isomerism.\n*   **2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** Shows optical isomerism.\n*   **3. benzophenone:** Does not show optical isomerism.\n*   **4. dimethyl fumarate:** Does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, only compounds 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Concept:** The question asks to identify which compounds exhibit optical isomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Key indicators of chirality are the presence of a chiral center (an atom, typically carbon, bonded to four different groups) or axial chirality (atropisomerism).

Optical isomerism is a property of chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicators of chirality are the presence of a chiral center (an atom bonded to four different groups) or the absence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion in the molecule's stable conformation.\n\n2.  **Analyze Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl compound. The two phenyl rings are joined by a single C-C bond.\n    *   **Substituents:** The positions ortho to the inter-ring bond (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are all substituted.\n        *   At positions 2 and 2', there are dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3).\n        *   At positions 6 and 6', there are nitro groups (-NO2).\n    *   **Chirality Check:** In biphenyls, if there are bulky substituents at the ortho positions, they can clash with each other, preventing free rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings. This restricted rotation is called \"atropisomerism\".\n    *   The nitro (-NO2) and dimethyl carboxylate (-COOCH3) groups are sufficiently bulky to hinder rotation. This locks the two phenyl rings in a non-planar (twisted) conformation.\n    *   Next, we check for symmetry. In this twisted conformation, there is no plane of symmetry that can cut the molecule into two identical halves, nor is there a center of inversion.\n    *   Because the molecule is non-planar and lacks these symmetry elements, it is chiral. Chiral molecules can exist as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers) and thus exhibit optical isomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Compound 1 shows optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyze Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** Let's break down the name. \"Propanoate\" indicates a 3-carbon chain with a carboxylate group. \"Methyl\" means it's an ester with a methyl group (CH3O-). \"2-hydroxy\" means an -OH group is on carbon-2.

It is bonded to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n        2.  It is bonded to a methyl group (-CH3).\n        3.  It is bonded to a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3).\n        4.  It is bonded to a hydrogen atom (-H).\n    *   Since Carbon-2 is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center.\n    *   A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Compound 2 shows optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **Analyze Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** The structure is C6H5-C(=O)-C6H5. It's a ketone with two phenyl groups attached to the carbonyl carbon.\n    *   **Chirality Check:**\n        *   There is no carbon atom with four different single-bonded substituents, so there is no chiral center.\n        *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry. A plane can be imagined passing through the C=O bond and bisecting the angle between the two phenyl rings. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   The molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Compound 3 does not show optical isomerism.\n\n5.  **Analyze Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** Fumarate is the trans-isomer of butenedioate. Dimethyl fumarate is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, where the two ester groups (-COOCH3) are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Chirality Check:**\n        *   There are no chiral centers.\n        *   The molecule is planar. The plane of the molecule itself is a plane of symmetry. It also possesses a center of inversion (a point in the middle of the C=C bond).\n    *   The molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Compound 4 does not show optical isomerism.\n\n6.  **Synthesize the Final Answer:**\n    *   Compound 1 is optically active (due to atropisomerism).\n    *   Compound 2 is optically active (due to a chiral center).\n    *   Compound 3 is not optically active (achiral).\n    *   Compound 4 is not optically active (achiral).\n\n    Therefore, the compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism:**\n    Optical isomerism is a type of stereoisomerism where a molecule is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. For a molecule to be chiral, it must lack any improper axis of rotation (S_n), which includes planes of symmetry (S_1) and centers of inversion (S_2). The most common features leading to chirality are:\n    1.  **Chiral Center:** An atom (usually carbon) bonded to four different groups.\n    2.  **Axial Chirality:** Chirality arising from restricted rotation around a single bond, as seen in some substituted biphenyls (atropisomers), allenes, and spiranes.\n    3.  **Planar Chirality:** Chirality arising from a plane in the molecule, as seen in compounds like ansa compounds or trans-cyclooctene.\n\n*   **Evaluation of each compound:**\n\n    1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:**\n        *   This is a biphenyl compound substituted at all four ortho-positions (positions 2, 6, 2', and 6').\n        *   The substituents are nitro groups (-NO2) and dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3). These are bulky groups.\n        *   The steric hindrance caused by these bulky ortho-substituents prevents free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This phenomenon is called atropisomerism.\n        *   Because rotation is restricted, the molecule is locked into a specific conformation. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion.\n        *   As a result, it is not superimposable on its mirror image. This is a classic example of axial chirality.\n        *   Therefore, this compound is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n    2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n        *   The chemical formula is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃.\n        *   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the hydroxyl group, -OH).\n        *   This carbon atom is bonded to four different groups:\n            1.  a hydrogen atom (-H)\n            2.  a hydroxyl group (-OH)\n            3.  a methyl group (-CH₃)\n            4.  a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n        *   Since this carbon is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center (or stereocenter).\n        *   The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral.\n        *   Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism (existing as R- and S-enantiomers).\n\n    3.  **benzophenone:**\n        *   The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. A central carbonyl group is bonded to two phenyl rings.\n        *   The molecule does not have a chiral center. The central carbon is sp² hybridized.\n        *   The molecule possesses elements of symmetry. It has a C₂ rotational axis passing through the C=O bond. Even in its twisted, low-energy conformation, its mirror image is superimposable upon the original molecule.\n        *   Therefore, benzophenone is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n    4.  **dimethyl fumarate:**\n        *   This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid (trans-butenedioic acid).\n        *   Its structure is trans-CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n        *   The molecule is planar. This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry.\n        *   Additionally, the molecule has a center of inversion (or center of symmetry) located at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n        *   A molecule with a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is achiral.\n        *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    Based on the analysis, compounds 1 (due to axial chirality/atropisomerism) and 2 (due to a chiral center) are chiral and will show optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral.\n\nThus, the correct option includes only 1 and 2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\n**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the question:** The user wants to identify which of the four given organic compounds can exhibit optical isomerism.\n2.  **Define Optical Isomerism:** Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is **chiral**. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups), but other sources exist, such as axial chirality (atropisomerism). A key test for chirality is the absence of any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. If a molecule has either of these symmetry elements, it is **achiral** and will not be optically active.\n\n3.  **Analyze each compound:**\n\n    *   **1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:**\n        *   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl. The two phenyl rings are joined by a single C-C bond.\n        *   **Key Feature:** The positions ortho to the linking bond (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are all substituted with large groups: two nitro groups (-NO2) and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3).\n        *   **Chirality Analysis:** These large groups cause significant steric hindrance, which prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the central single bond. This restricted rotation forces the rings to be non-coplanar. The resulting twisted conformation lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. This type of chirality, arising from hindered rotation about a single bond, is called **atropisomerism**. Since the molecule is chiral, it will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n        *   **Structure:** This is an ester, commonly known as methyl lactate. Its chemical formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n        *   **Key Feature:** Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2, which is bonded to the hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n        *   **Chirality Analysis:** This carbon atom is bonded to four different groups:\n            1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n            2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n            3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n            4.  A methyl carboxylate group (-COOCH3)\n        *   Since this carbon is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a **chiral center** (or stereocenter). The presence of a single chiral center in a molecule makes it chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will exhibit optical isomerism (existing as R and S enantiomers).\n\n    *   **3. benzophenone:**\n        *   **Structure:** This is a ketone with the formula (C6H5)2CO or Ph-C(=O)-Ph.\n        *   **Key Feature:** The central carbon is part of a carbonyl group (C=O), so it's sp2 hybridized and bonded to only three groups (two phenyl rings and one oxygen). It cannot be a chiral center.\n        *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule possesses a **plane of symmetry**. Imagine a plane cutting through the C=O bond and bisecting the angle between the two phenyl rings. The left half of the molecule is a mirror image of the right half. Because it has a plane of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and cannot exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **4. dimethyl fumarate:**\n        *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans* isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is trans-CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3.\n        *   **Key Feature:** It is a planar molecule due to the C=C double bond.\n        *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is highly symmetrical. It possesses a **center of inversion** at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. It also has a **plane of symmetry** (the plane of the molecule itself). The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate will not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Compound 1 is chiral (atropisomerism).\n    *   Compound 2 is chiral (chiral center).\n    *   Compound 3 is achiral (plane of symmetry).\n    *   Compound 4 is achiral (center of inversion and plane of symmetry).\n\n    Therefore, the compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nAn organic compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Let's analyze each compound to determine if it is chiral.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl derivative. In biphenyl systems, if the four ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6') are occupied by bulky substituents, the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is hindered due to steric strain.\n    *   **Analysis:** In this molecule, all four ortho positions are substituted with large groups: two nitro groups (-NO2) at positions 6 and 6', and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3) at positions 2 and 2'. This steric hindrance prevents the two rings from becoming coplanar. The molecule is forced into a stable, twisted conformation. This molecule lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. As a result, it is chiral and its mirror image is non-superimposable. This type of stereoisomerism is called atropisomerism, which is a form of axial chirality.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** The chemical structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. This is an ester commonly known as methyl lactate.\n    *   **Analysis:** To check for chirality, we look for asymmetric carbon atoms (chiral centers). A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Let's examine carbon-2 (the carbon atom bearing the hydroxyl group):\n        *   It is bonded to a hydrogen atom (-H).\n        *   It is bonded to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n        *   It is bonded to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n        *   It is bonded to a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃).\n        Since all four groups attached to carbon-2 are different, it is a chiral center.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a chiral center makes the molecule chiral, and therefore it shows optical isomerism. It exists as two enantiomers (R and S forms).\n\n3.  **benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. It consists of a carbonyl group bonded to two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Analysis:** The central carbon atom is sp² hybridized, bonded to only three groups (one oxygen and two phenyl rings), so it cannot be a chiral center. The molecule possesses elements of symmetry. For instance, there is a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is an achiral molecule and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   **Analysis:** The molecule is planar. It possesses both a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and a center of inversion (the midpoint of the C=C double bond). The presence of any element of symmetry like a plane or center of symmetry makes a molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is an achiral molecule and does not show optical isomerism. (Note: It does show geometric isomerism with its *cis*-isomer, dimethyl maleate).\n\nBased on the analysis, compounds 1 and 2 are chiral and will show optical isomerism, while compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and will not.\n\nTherefore, the correct option includes 1 and 2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere's a breakdown of each compound to determine if it exhibits optical isomerism:\n\n**Optical Isomerism**\nA compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is **chiral**. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality are:\n1.  The presence of a **chiral center** (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups).\n2.  The presence of **axial chirality**, where rotation around a bond is restricted, leading to a structure that lacks a plane of symmetry (e.g., atropisomerism in biphenyls).\n\nLet's analyze each molecule:\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl. The two phenyl rings are connected by a single carbon-carbon bond.\n*   **Analysis:** The positions ortho to the connecting bond (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are all substituted with large, bulky groups (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃). These bulky groups sterically hinder each other, preventing free rotation around the single bond that connects the two phenyl rings. This restricted rotation forces the rings to be twisted out of the same plane. In this twisted, non-planar conformation, the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. This phenomenon is called **atropisomerism**, which is a form of axial chirality.\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral and will show optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Structure:** The chemical formula is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃.\n*   **Analysis:** Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2), which is bonded to the hydroxyl (-OH) group. This carbon is attached to four different groups:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the central carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a **chiral center**. Molecules with a single chiral center are always chiral. Therefore, it will show optical isomerism.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n*   **Structure:** The chemical formula is (C₆H₅)₂CO. It consists of a carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two phenyl rings.\n*   **Analysis:** The molecule is symmetrical.

A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common features that lead to chirality are:\n1.  **Chiral Center (Asymmetric Carbon):** A carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n2.  **Axial Chirality (Atropisomerism):** Chirality arising from restricted rotation around a single bond, typically seen in substituted biphenyl compounds.\n3.  **Absence of Symmetry Elements:** Chiral molecules lack a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion.\n\nLet's examine each compound:\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl derivative. The two phenyl rings are connected by a single bond.\n*   **Analysis:** The key to chirality in biphenyls is restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the rings. This restriction, known as atropisomerism, occurs when there are bulky substituents at the *ortho* positions (the positions next to the connecting bond: 2, 6, 2', and 6').\n*   In this molecule, all four *ortho* positions are substituted:\n    *   Positions 2 and 2' have bulky methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH₃).\n    *   Positions 6 and 6' have bulky nitro groups (-NO₂).\n*   These large groups physically block the free rotation around the central C-C bond. This forces the two phenyl rings to be in different planes (non-coplanar). The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it non-superimposable on its mirror image.\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule is chiral due to atropisomerism and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (Methyl lactate)**\n*   **Structure:** CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃\n*   **Analysis:** We need to check for chiral centers. Let's look at the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group).\n*   This carbon atom is bonded to four different groups:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n*   Since the carbon at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center.\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral, and thus it exhibits optical isomerism. It exists as two enantiomers (R- and S-methyl lactate).\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n*   **Structure:** (C₆H₅)₂C=O. It consists of two phenyl rings attached to a central carbonyl carbon.\n*   **Analysis:** The central carbon atom is sp² hybridized and is only bonded to three groups (two phenyl rings, one oxygen). It cannot be a chiral center. The molecule as a whole is symmetric. It has a plane of symmetry that runs through the C=O bond, bisecting the molecule.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the molecule possesses a plane of symmetry, it is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism. It is superimposable on its mirror image.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is *trans*-CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n*   **Analysis:** The molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond. There are no chiral centers. The molecule has both a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and a center of inversion (at the midpoint of the C=C double bond).\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral. It does not exhibit optical isomerism. It does, however, have a geometric isomer (dimethyl maleate, the *cis*-isomer), but neither is optically active.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n*   Molecule 1: Shows optical isomerism (chiral).\n*   Molecule 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral).\n*   Molecule 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n*   Molecule 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nTherefore, the correct compounds are 1 and 2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\n**1. Analysis of dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl compound. The structure consists of two phenyl rings linked by a carbon-carbon single bond. There are substituents at the positions ortho to this bond (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). Specifically, two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH3) are at positions 2 and 2', and two nitro groups (-NO2) are at positions 6 and 6'.\n*   **Source of Chirality (Atropisomerism):** In biphenyl systems, if there are bulky substituents at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, 6'), they can sterically hinder the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restricted rotation can lock the molecule into a non-planar, twisted conformation.\n*   **Chirality Check:** For this specific molecule, all four ortho positions are substituted with bulky groups (-NO2 and -COOCH3). This severely restricts rotation. The resulting twisted conformation lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, making it non-superimposable on its mirror image. This phenomenon is called atropisomerism, which is a type of axial chirality. Therefore, this compound is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**2. Analysis of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\n*   **Structure:** The chemical name describes an ester derived from 2-hydroxypropanoic acid (lactic acid) and methanol. Its structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n*   **Source of Chirality (Chiral Center):** A common source of chirality in organic molecules is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n*   **Chirality Check:** Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl group). The four groups attached to this carbon are:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n*   Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center. The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral and thus optically active. It can exist as two non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers).\n\n**3. Analysis of benzophenone**\n\n*   **Structure:** Benzophenone is also known as diphenyl ketone. Its structure is (C6H5)2C=O, where a central carbonyl group is attached to two phenyl rings.\n*   **Chirality Check:** To be optically active, a molecule must be chiral (not superimposable on its mirror image). A simple way to check for this is to look for elements of symmetry, such as a plane of symmetry. The benzophenone molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral. Therefore, benzophenone is not optically active.\n\n**4. Analysis of dimethyl fumarate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The structure of dimethyl fumarate is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides (*trans*) of the carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Chirality Check:** The molecule is planar due to the sp2 hybridization of the carbons in the double bond.\n    *   It has a plane of symmetry which is the plane of the molecule itself.\n    *   It also possesses a center of inversion (or center of symmetry) located at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n*   The presence of these symmetry elements means the molecule is achiral and therefore not optically active.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Compound 1 (dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate) shows optical isomerism due to atropisomerism.\n*   Compound 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) shows optical isomerism due to a chiral center.\n*   Compound 3 (benzophenone) is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n*   Compound 4 (dimethyl fumarate) is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the correct options are 1 and 2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nAn analysis of each compound is required to determine if it exhibits optical isomerism.

These bulky groups hinder the free rotation around the C-C single bond connecting the rings. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, forces the two rings to be in different planes.

A molecule with an axis of rotation is not necessarily achiral, but benzophenone's symmetry makes it superimposable on its mirror image. The molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is trans-CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Analysis:** The molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond. Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself). This molecule also possesses a center of inversion at the midpoint of the double bond. The presence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion makes a molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (atropisomerism).\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral center).\n*   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n*   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nTherefore, the correct options are compounds 1 and 2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis question asks us to identify which of the given compounds can exhibit optical isomerism. Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are molecules that are non-superimposable on their mirror images. Let's analyze each compound for chirality.\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl compound. The two phenyl rings are joined by a single C-C bond.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:** Biphenyl compounds can exhibit a type of stereoisomerism called **atropisomerism**. This happens when rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings is significantly restricted, usually by bulky substituents in the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6').\n*   In this molecule, all four ortho positions are substituted with bulky groups: two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH3) at positions 2 and 2', and two nitro groups (-NO2) at positions 6 and 6'.\n*   The steric hindrance from these large groups prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the single bond that connects them. This locks the molecule into a twisted, non-planar conformation.\n*   This fixed, non-planar conformation lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. As a result, its mirror image is non-superimposable.\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral due to atropisomerism and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Structure:** This molecule has the chemical formula CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. It is the methyl ester of lactic acid.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:** We need to look for a chiral center. A chiral center is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n*   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one attached to the -OH group):\n    1.  It is bonded to a hydrogen atom (-H).\n    2.  It is bonded to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n    3.  It is bonded to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    4.  It is bonded to a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃).\n*   Since this carbon atom is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center (or stereocenter).\n*   **Conclusion:** Molecules containing a single chiral center are always chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism. It exists as a pair of enantiomers (R and S isomers).\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n*   **Structure:** This molecule has the chemical formula (C₆H₅)₂CO. It consists of a central carbonyl group (C=O) attached to two phenyl rings.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:** To be chiral, a molecule must not be superimposable on its mirror image. This is often because it lacks any elements of symmetry like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n*   The benzophenone molecule is not planar in its lowest energy state due to steric interactions between the phenyl rings, but the barrier to rotation around the C-C bonds is very low, allowing for rapid interconversion between twisted conformations at room temperature.\n*   More importantly, the molecule can easily adopt a conformation that has a plane of symmetry. This plane would pass through the C=O bond and bisect the angle between the two phenyl rings. The presence of a plane of symmetry makes a molecule achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is achiral and therefore does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is H₃COOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the -COOCH₃ groups on opposite sides of the double bond.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:** This molecule is planar. Let's check for elements of symmetry.\n*   It has a **plane of symmetry**, which is the plane of the molecule itself.\n*   It also has a **center of inversion** at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. If you start at any atom, go to the center, and continue the same distance in the opposite direction, you will find an identical atom.\n*   A molecule with a center of inversion is always achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not show optical isomerism. It is a geometric isomer (stereoisomer), but not an optical isomer.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: Chiral (atropisomerism)\n*   Compound 2: Chiral (chiral center)\n*   Compound 3: Achiral (has a plane of symmetry)\n*   Compound 4: Achiral (has a center of inversion)\n\nTherefore, the compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nAn optical isomer is a type of stereoisomer that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Such molecules are called chiral. Let's analyze each of the given compounds for chirality to determine if they exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl compound. The two phenyl rings are connected by a single C-C bond.\n*   **Chirality Source:** This molecule is an example of atropisomerism, which gives rise to axial chirality. Rotation around the single bond between the two phenyl rings is severely restricted by the presence of large (bulky) substituent groups at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6').\n*   **Analysis:** In this molecule, the ortho positions are substituted with nitro groups (-NO2) and dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3). Both of these groups are bulky enough to prevent the two rings from becoming coplanar through free rotation.\n*   **Symmetry:** For such a hindered biphenyl to be chiral, it must lack a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. The substitution pattern here (nitro at 6, 6' and ester at 2, 2') results in a twisted structure that is not superimposable on its mirror image.\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\n*   **Structure:** The chemical formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. This is the methyl ester of lactic acid.\n*   **Chirality Source:** This molecule contains a potential stereocenter. A stereocenter (or chiral center) is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n*   **Analysis:** Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bearing the hydroxyl group). It is bonded to:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the carbon at position 2 is attached to four different groups, it is a stereocenter. A molecule with one stereocenter is always chiral (unless it's part of a meso compound, which is not the case here). Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exhibits optical isomerism, existing as a pair of enantiomers (R and S forms).\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n\n*   **Structure:** The chemical formula is (C6H5)2CO. It is a ketone where the carbonyl carbon is attached to two phenyl rings.\n*   **Chirality Source:** We check for stereocenters and overall molecular symmetry.\n*   **Analysis:** There are no stereocenters in the molecule. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that contains the C=O group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans* isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The structure has a C=C double bond with a -COOCH3 group and a -H on each carbon, arranged in a *trans* configuration.\n*   **Chirality Source:** We check for stereocenters and overall molecular symmetry.\n*   **Analysis:** The molecule is planar. Any planar molecule possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself), which makes it achiral. Additionally, dimethyl fumarate has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. The presence of either a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion renders a molecule achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n*   **1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:** Shows optical isomerism.\n*   **2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** Shows optical isomerism.\n*   **3. benzophenone:** Does not show optical isomerism.\n*   **4. dimethyl fumarate:** Does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, only compounds 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
