Understand C3h Symmetry**\n\nA molecule belongs to the C3h point group if it has the following symmetry elements:\n*   A **principal C3 axis** of rotation (rotation by 360/3 = 120° leaves the molecule unchanged).\n*   A **horizontal mirror plane (σh)** that is perpendicular to the C3 axis.\nThe C3h point group also implies the existence of an S3 improper rotation axis, but the presence of C3 and σh is sufficient for our analysis. A molecule whose point group is a supergroup of C3h (e.g., D3h) also possesses C3h symmetry.\n\n### **2. Analyze Each Molecule**\n\nLet's examine the structure and symmetry of each option.\n\n**A) triisopropyl borate (B(OCH(CH3)2)3)**\n*   **Structure:** It has a central boron atom bonded to three isopropoxy groups. The B and the three oxygen atoms prefer a trigonal planar arrangement (the BO3 core).\n*   **Symmetry:** Due to the steric bulk of the three isopropyl groups, they cannot all lie flat in the same plane. To minimize steric repulsion, they twist out of the BO3 plane in a concerted, propeller-like fashion.\n*   **Point Group:** This propeller conformation has a C3 axis passing through the boron atom, perpendicular to the BO3 plane. However, it lacks any mirror planes, including a horizontal one (σh), because reflecting across the BO3 plane would not result in an identical molecule. Therefore, its point group is **C3**. It does not have C3h symmetry.\n\n**D) quinuclidine (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane)**\n*   **Structure:** This is a rigid, bicyclic amine with a cage-like structure. It has a nitrogen atom and a CH group at opposite bridgehead positions.\n*   **Symmetry:** There is a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposing bridgehead carbon and hydrogen. There are also three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain this C3 axis and one of the three ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges.\n*   **Point Group:** The combination of a C3 axis and three σv planes defines the **C3v** point group. It does not have a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n\n**C) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n*   **Structure:** This molecule consists of a triphenylene core with three anhydride groups fused to its \"bay\" regions. Triphenylene itself is a large, planar aromatic system.\n*   **Symmetry:** While one might expect this large fused system to be planar, there is significant steric hindrance between the carbonyl groups of the adjacent anhydride rings. This strain forces the molecule to distort from planarity, twisting into a non-planar, helical, propeller-like shape.\n*   **Point Group:** This twisted structure loses its horizontal mirror plane (σh). It retains the C3 axis and three C2 axes perpendicular to it. Its point group is **D3**. It does not have C3h symmetry.\n\n**B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n*   **Structure:** This molecule, also known as mellitic trianhydride, consists of a central benzene ring with three anhydride groups fused to it.\n*   **Symmetry:** Unlike the larger triphenylene derivative, this molecule is small enough that it can maintain a perfectly planar structure.\n    *   It has a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane, passing through the center of the benzene ring.\n    *   Because the molecule is planar, the plane of the molecule itself serves as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n*   **Point Group:** The presence of both a C3 axis and a perpendicular σh plane means the molecule has at least C3h symmetry. In fact, it also has three C2 axes lying within the plane, making its full point group **D3h**. Since the D3h group contains all the symmetry elements of the C3h group, this molecule possesses C3h symmetry.\n\n### **3. Conclusion**\n\nComparing the point groups of the four molecules:\n*   A) Triisopropyl borate: **C3** (lacks σh)\n*   B) Benzo[...]hexaone: **D3h** (has C3 and σh)\n*   C) Triphenyleno[...]hexaone: **D3** (lacks σh)\n*   D) Quinuclidine: **C3v** (lacks σh)\n\nOnly molecule B has both a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Therefore, it is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\n1.  **Analyze the symmetry elements of the C3h point group.**\n    *   **C3 axis:** A threefold rotational axis. Rotating the molecule by 120° (360°/3) about this axis leaves it unchanged.\n    *   **σh plane (horizontal mirror plane):** A mirror plane perpendicular to the principal C3 axis. Reflecting the molecule through this plane leaves it unchanged.\n    *   The C3h point group also contains an S3 improper rotation axis and an identity element (E). The presence of a C3 axis and a σh plane is sufficient to define the C3h point group.\n\n2.  **Examine the structure and symmetry of each molecule.**\n\n    *   **A) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone:** This molecule is also known as mellitic trianhydride. It consists of a central benzene ring fused to three maleic anhydride-like rings. The entire molecule is planar.\n        *   It has a C3 axis passing through the center of the benzene ring, perpendicular to the molecular plane. A 120° rotation leaves the molecule unchanged.\n        *   It has three C2 axes lying in the plane of the molecule, passing through opposite C-C bonds of the central ring.\n        *   It has a σh plane, which is the plane of the molecule itself.\n        *   It also has three σv planes (vertical mirror planes) that contain the C3 axis.\n        *   The combination of a C3 axis, three C2 axes perpendicular to it, and a σh plane places this molecule in the **D3h** point group, not C3h.\n\n    *   **B) triisopropyl borate:** The chemical formula is B(O-iPr)3, where iPr is the isopropyl group, -CH(CH3)2. Boron is the central atom, bonded to three oxygen atoms. Each oxygen is bonded to an isopropyl group.\n        *   The B(OC)3 core is planar due to sp2 hybridization of the boron atom. A C3 axis passes through the boron atom, perpendicular to this BO3 plane.\n        *   To minimize steric hindrance, the three isopropyl groups will arrange themselves in a propeller-like fashion. The C-H bond of the isopropyl group (the one attached to oxygen) will lie roughly in the BO3 plane, and the two methyl groups of each isopropyl will be positioned one above and one below the plane.\n        *   Let's check for the C3h symmetry elements:\n            *   **C3 axis:** Yes, the axis passing through the boron atom perpendicular to the BO3 plane is a C3 axis. Rotating the molecule 120° around this axis exchanges the positions of the three -O-iPr groups.\n            *   **σh plane:** Let's consider the plane containing the B and three O atoms as a potential horizontal mirror plane. For this to be a σh plane, reflecting through it must leave the molecule unchanged. If we reflect one isopropyl group through this plane, the methyl group above the plane moves to the position of the methyl group below the plane, and vice versa. This operation leaves each isopropyl group, and thus the entire molecule, unchanged.\n        *   Since the molecule possesses both a C3 axis and a σh plane perpendicular to it, it belongs to the **C3h** point group.\n\n    *   **C) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone:** This is a large, planar, polycyclic aromatic molecule. It is built from a central triphenylene core.\n        *   Due to its planarity and propeller-like shape, it possesses a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n        *   However, like molecule A, it also has three C2 axes in the plane of the molecule.\n        *   The plane of the molecule acts as a σh plane.\n        *   The combination of C3, three perpendicular C2 axes, and a σh plane places this molecule in the **D3h** point group.\n\n    *   **D) quinuclidine:** This is a bicyclic amine with the formula C7H13N. It has a cage-like structure with the nitrogen and a CH group at the bridgehead positions.\n        *   A C3 axis passes through the N atom and the opposing C-H bridgehead.\n        *   There are three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis and one of the -(CH2)2- bridges.\n        *   The molecule does not have a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the C3 axis. Reflection through such a plane would move the nitrogen atom to the CH group's position, which is not an equivalent configuration.\n        *   Therefore, quinuclidine belongs to the **C3v** point group.\n\n3.  **Conclusion.**\n    Based on the analysis, only triisopropyl borate has the required C3 axis and a perpendicular σh plane, correctly assigning it to the C3h point group.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the symmetry of each molecule to determine which one belongs to the C3h point group.\n\nThe C3h point group is characterized by the presence of a principal threefold axis of rotation (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the C3 axis. The presence of these two elements automatically implies the existence of a threefold axis of improper rotation (S3).\n\n1.  **Quinuclidine (A)**\n    *   **Structure:** Quinuclidine (C7H13N) is a bicyclic amine with a cage-like structure. The nitrogen atom and a CH group are at the two bridgehead positions.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n        *   There is a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposing bridgehead carbon-hydrogen bond.\n        *   There are three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain this C3 axis and one of the three ethylenic (-CH2-CH2-) bridges.\n        *   The combination of a C3 axis and three σv planes defines the **C3v** point group. It does not have a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Thus, it is not C3h.\n\n2.  **Triisopropyl borate (B)**\n    *   **Structure:** Triisopropyl borate, B(OCH(CH3)2)3, has a central boron atom bonded to three isopropoxy groups.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n        *   The BO3 core is likely to be trigonal planar, which would allow for a C3 axis perpendicular to this plane.\n        *   For the molecule to have C3h symmetry, a horizontal mirror plane (σh) must exist, which would coincide with the BO3 plane.\n        *   Let's examine an isopropoxy group, -OCH(CH3)2. For the σh plane to be a symmetry element, the group must be symmetric upon reflection through this plane. If the C-H bond of the isopropyl group lies in the plane, one methyl group (-CH3) would be above the plane and the other below. Reflection would swap their positions, but a methyl group is not a mirror image of another methyl group in this configuration. The atoms within the methyl groups would not map onto each other.\n        *   Due to the steric bulk and free rotation of the isopropyl groups, the molecule is likely to adopt a \"propeller\" conformation (point group C3) or a conformation with no symmetry at all (point group C1) to minimize steric strain. A C3h conformation is sterically unfavorable and geometrically impossible.\n\n3.  **Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (D)**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule is more commonly known as mellitic trianhydride. It consists of a central benzene ring to which three dicarboxylic anhydride groups are fused, forming a planar molecule.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n        *   The molecule is planar, so it has a horizontal mirror plane (σh) which is the plane of the molecule.\n        *   There is a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane, passing through the center of the benzene ring.\n        *   In addition, there are three C2 axes lying in the plane of the molecule, each passing through the center and bisecting the sides of the central benzene ring that are not part of the anhydride fusions.\n        *   The presence of a C3 axis with three perpendicular C2 axes means the molecule belongs to the D3 family. The presence of a σh plane makes the point group **D3h**.\n        *   While D3h contains all the symmetry elements of C3h, the question asks for the molecule that *has* C3h symmetry, which implies assigning the highest point group. The point group for this molecule is D3h, not C3h.\n\n4.  **Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone (C)**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule is a trianhydride derivative of triphenylene. It consists of a planar triphenylene core with three anhydride groups fused to its outer bays. The entire molecule is planar.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n        *   The molecule is planar, so it possesses a horizontal mirror plane (σh) that is the molecular plane itself.\n        *   It has a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane, passing through the center of the molecule.\n        *   Let's check for other symmetry elements. Unlike mellitic trianhydride (D) or triphenylene itself, this molecule does not possess any C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis, nor does it have any vertical mirror planes (σv). The \"propeller-like\" arrangement of the anhydride groups around the core breaks these symmetries.\n        *   The only symmetry elements are the identity (E), C3 rotation, and the horizontal mirror plane (σh) (which also implies an S3 improper rotation). This set of symmetry elements defines the **C3h** point group.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Quinuclidine: C3v\n*   Triisopropyl borate: Not C3h (likely C3 or C1)\n*   Triphenyleno[...]hexaone: **C3h**\n*   Benzo[...]hexaone: D3h\n\nTherefore, the molecule that has C3h symmetry is triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the symmetry of each molecule to determine which one belongs to the C3h point group.\n\nThe C3h point group requires two key symmetry elements:\n1.  A **C3 axis**: A threefold axis of rotation. Rotating the molecule by 360°/3 = 120° around this axis leaves the molecule indistinguishable.\n2.  A **σh plane**: A horizontal mirror plane that is perpendicular to the principal C3 axis. Reflection through this plane leaves the molecule indistinguishable.\n\nCrucially, a molecule in the C3h point group must *not* have additional symmetry elements like vertical mirror planes (σv) or perpendicular C2 axes, which would place it in a higher symmetry group like D3h or D3d.\n\nLet's examine each option:\n\n**A) Triisopropyl borate (B(O-iPr)3)**\n*   **Structure**: A central boron atom is bonded to three oxygen atoms in a trigonal planar arrangement. Each oxygen is bonded to an isopropyl group, -CH(CH3)2.\n*   **Flexibility**: This molecule is conformationally flexible due to free rotation around the B-O and O-C bonds. We need to see if a conformation with C3h symmetry is possible.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis**:\n    *   Let's place the central boron atom at the origin and the three oxygen atoms in the xy-plane. The axis perpendicular to this plane (the z-axis) is a potential C3 axis.\n    *   For the xy-plane to be a σh mirror plane, each of the three isopropyl groups must be arranged symmetrically with respect to it.\n    *   This can be achieved if, for each isopropyl group, the central carbon and its attached hydrogen (-CH) lie within the xy-plane. The two methyl (-CH3) groups attached to that carbon would then be positioned symmetrically, one above the plane and one below.\n    *   If all three isopropyl groups adopt this orientation, arranged 120° apart around the boron, the entire molecule would possess a C3 axis and a σh plane.\n    *   Let's check for other symmetry elements in this specific conformation. There would be no vertical mirror planes (σv) or perpendicular C2 axes.\n    *   Therefore, a plausible, albeit perhaps not the lowest-energy, conformation of triisopropyl borate exists that belongs to the **C3h** point group.\n\n**B) Quinuclidine (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane)**\n*   **Structure**: This is a rigid, cage-like bicyclic amine.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis**:\n    *   There is a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposing bridgehead carbon-hydrogen (C-H) group.\n    *   There are three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis and pass through one of the three ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges.\n    *   There is no horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n    *   The presence of a C3 axis and three σv planes defines the point group as **C3v**.\n\n**C) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n*   **Structure**: This is the chemical name for mellitic trianhydride (C12O9). It is a rigid, planar molecule consisting of a central benzene ring fused with three anhydride groups.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis**:\n    *   Being planar, the plane of the molecule acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n    *   There is a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane, passing through the center of the benzene ring.\n    *   However, the molecule also possesses three C2 axes lying within the molecular plane and three vertical mirror planes (σv) that contain the C3 axis.\n    *   These combined symmetry elements place the molecule in the **D3h** point group, which is a higher symmetry group than C3h.\n\n**D) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n*   **Structure**: This is a larger analogue of mellitic trianhydride, built upon a triphenylene core. It is also a rigid, planar molecule.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis**:\n    *   Similar to mellitic trianhydride, this molecule is planar and possesses a C3 axis, a σh plane, three perpendicular C2 axes, and three vertical σv planes.\n    *   Its point group is also **D3h**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nOf the four options, quinuclidine (C3v), mellitic trianhydride (D3h), and the triphenylene derivative (D3h) have rigid structures that do not belong to the C3h point group. Only triisopropyl borate is conformationally flexible, and a specific, high-symmetry conformation exists that perfectly fits the C3h point group requirements.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry. The C3h point group is characterized by the presence of a principal C3 axis of rotation and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to it. It does not contain any vertical mirror planes (σv) or C2 axes perpendicular to the principal axis.\n\n1.  **Analyze Quinuclidine (A)**\n    *   **Structure**: Quinuclidine is a bicyclic amine with the formula C7H13N. It has a cage-like structure with a nitrogen atom at one bridgehead and a CH group at the other. The two bridgeheads are connected by three ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges.\n    *   **Symmetry Elements**:\n        *   There is a C3 axis passing through the nitrogen atom and the opposing bridgehead carbon.\n        *   There are three vertical mirror planes (σv), each passing through the C3 axis and bisecting one of the ethylene bridges.\n    *   **Point Group**: The combination of a C3 axis and three σv planes defines the **C3v** point group. It lacks a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Therefore, it does not have C3h symmetry.\n\n2.  **Analyze Triisopropyl borate (B)**\n    *   **Structure**: The formula is B(O-i-Pr)3, which is B(OCH(CH3)2)3. A central boron atom is bonded to three oxygen atoms, and each oxygen is bonded to an isopropyl group. The B-O3 core is trigonal planar.\n    *   **Symmetry Elements**:\n        *   There is a C3 axis passing through the boron atom, perpendicular to the plane formed by the three oxygen atoms.\n        *   To minimize steric hindrance, the molecule can adopt a specific conformation. In this conformation, the plane containing the boron and the three oxygen atoms acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n        *   For this to be a σh plane, each isopropyl group [-CH(CH3)2] must be oriented symmetrically with respect to this plane. This is achieved if the C-H bond of the isopropyl group lies within the plane, with one methyl group positioned above the plane and the other below it.\n        *   The C3 rotation maps each of the three identical isopropyl groups onto the next.\n        *   The σh reflection swaps the \"up\" and \"down\" methyl groups on each isopropyl group, leaving the molecule unchanged.\n    *   **Point Group**: The molecule possesses a C3 axis and a σh plane, but it lacks any C2 axes perpendicular to C3 or any σv planes. This corresponds exactly to the **C3h** point group.\n\n3.  **Analyze Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone (C)**\n    *   **Structure**: This is a large, complex molecule with a triphenylene core fused to three anhydride rings.\n    *   **Symmetry Elements**: Due to severe steric hindrance between the adjacent anhydride groups, the molecule is not planar. It twists into a propeller-like shape.\n        *   This propeller shape has a C3 axis of rotation passing through the center of the molecule, perpendicular to the general plane.\n        *   However, because of the twisting, it loses all mirror planes (both σh and σv) and any C2 axes.\n    *   **Point Group**: With only a C3 axis, the point group is **C3**.\n\n4.  **Analyze Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (D)**\n    *   **Structure**: This compound is more commonly known as mellitic trianhydride. It consists of a central benzene ring fused to three dicarboxylic anhydride rings.\n    *   **Symmetry Elements**:\n        *   The molecule is completely planar.\n        *   There is a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n        *   The molecular plane itself is a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n        *   There are three C2 axes lying within the molecular plane, passing through the center and bisecting opposite bonds of the central benzene ring.\n        *   There are also three vertical mirror planes (σv) that contain the C3 axis.\n    *   **Point Group**: The combination of C3, 3 C2, σh, and 3 σv defines the **D3h** point group. While a D3h molecule contains all the symmetry elements of the C3h group (C3 and σh), its full symmetry is higher. In point group classification, the highest possible symmetry group is used.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Quinuclidine is C3v.\n*   Triisopropyl borate is C3h.\n*   The triphenylene derivative is C3.\n*   The benzo derivative (mellitic trianhydride) is D3h.\n\nThe question asks which molecule has C3h symmetry.

The B(O)₃ core is trigonal planar.\n        *   Symmetry elements: The isopropyl groups (-CH(CH₃)₂) are not planar and can rotate around the B-O and O-C bonds. Due to steric hindrance, the most stable conformation is likely a \"propeller\" shape where all three isopropyl groups are twisted in the same direction.\n        *   This propeller conformation would possess a C₃ rotational axis passing through the boron atom, perpendicular to the B(O)₃ plane.\n        *   However, it lacks a horizontal mirror plane (σh) because reflecting the atoms of the isopropyl groups (which are out of the B(O)₃ plane) across this plane does not result in an identical configuration. The atoms above the plane would be mapped to empty space below the plane.\n        *   Therefore, its point group is most likely C₃, not C₃h.\n\n    2.  **B) Quinuclidine (1-Azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane)**:\n        *   Structure: A rigid bicyclic amine with a cage-like structure.\n        *   Symmetry elements: There is a C₃ rotational axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposing bridgehead carbon atom (CH).\n        *   There are also three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C₃ axis and pass through the middle of one of the three -(CH₂)₂- bridges.\n        *   The presence of a C₃ axis and three σv planes defines the C₃v point group.\n        *   It does not have a horizontal mirror plane (σh).

The group also includes the operations generated by these, which are C3^2, S3 (improper rotation), and S3^5. For a molecule to have C3h symmetry, it must possess, at a minimum, a C3 axis and a perpendicular σh plane.\n\nLet's analyze the symmetry of each molecule:\n\n**A) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n*   **Structure Identification**: This is the chemical name for mellitic trianhydride.

The molecule is flexible due to rotation around the B-O and O-C bonds.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis**:\n    *   Due to steric hindrance, the bulky isopropyl groups will likely arrange themselves in a propeller-like fashion, giving rise to a C3 axis passing through the boron atom.\n    *   For the molecule to have a horizontal mirror plane (σh), the central B(O)3 part would need to be planar, and each isopropyl group would have to be symmetrically arranged with respect to this plane. This is sterically hindered and conformationally unfavorable. The sp3 hybridization at the alpha-carbons prevents the necessary planarity.\n    *   The most stable, low-energy conformation of this molecule is predicted to be a twisted, propeller-like structure belonging to the **C3** point group. This structure has a C3 axis but lacks any mirror planes.\n*   **Point Group**: The ground state conformation is likely **C3**.

A molecule with D3h symmetry has all the symmetry elements of the C3h group (C3 and σh) plus additional elements. Among the given options, molecule A is the only one that unambiguously possesses both a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane. The other molecules all lack a horizontal mirror plane. Therefore, molecule A is the correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry.\n\nThe C3h point group is characterized by the presence of a C3 axis of rotation (rotation by 120 degrees) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to this axis. The presence of these two elements automatically implies the existence of an S3 improper rotation axis.\n\nLet's examine the symmetry of each molecule:\n\n1.  **Quinuclidine (A)**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a bicyclic molecule with a nitrogen atom at one bridgehead and a CH group at the other. These two bridgeheads are connected by three equivalent -(CH2)2- bridges.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n        *   There is a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposite bridgehead carbon atom.\n        *   There are three vertical mirror planes (σv), each containing the C3 axis and bisecting one of the ethylene bridges.\n        *   There is no horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The point group for quinuclidine is **C3v**.\n\n2.  **Triisopropyl borate (D)**\n    *   **Structure:** B(O-i-Pr)3. It has a central boron atom bonded to three oxygen atoms, each of which is bonded to an isopropyl group.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n        *   The B(O)3 core is trigonal planar. A C3 axis passes through the boron atom, perpendicular to the B(O)3 plane.\n        *   However, the isopropyl groups (-CH(CH3)2) are not planar. Due to steric hindrance, they will twist out of the plane, creating a propeller-like structure.\n        *   This propeller conformation retains the C3 axis but destroys the horizontal mirror plane (σh). Reflecting the methyl groups of an isopropyl group through the B(O)3 plane does not result in an equivalent configuration.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The most stable conformation of triisopropyl borate has **C3** symmetry, not C3h.\n\n3.  **Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (C)**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule has a central benzene ring to which three maleic anhydride-like rings are symmetrically fused.

This conformation maintains the C3 axis.\n        *   However, there is no horizontal mirror plane (σh). The plane containing the B and O atoms cannot be a mirror plane because the non-planar isopropyl groups do not have a corresponding mirrored image.

An axis passing through the midpoint of the C2-C3 bond, for example, would not be a symmetry element because one side of the axis has an anhydride ring while the other does not.\n        *   There are no vertical mirror planes (σv).

It also has three vertical mirror planes (σv) containing the C3 axis.\n    *   Point Group: **C3v**. It lacks the horizontal mirror plane (σh) required for C3h symmetry.\n\n2.  **Triisopropyl borate (B)**:\n    *   Structure: B(O-iPr)3. It has a central boron atom bonded to three isopropoxy groups.\n    *   Symmetry: Due to the free rotation of the isopropyl groups, the molecule typically exists in a low-symmetry conformation. Even in a high-symmetry \"propeller-like\" conformation, the non-planar nature of the isopropyl groups prevents the existence of a horizontal mirror plane. The point group is most likely C3. It lacks the σh plane.\n\n3.  **Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (A)**:\n    *   Structure: This is Mellitic anhydride. It is a planar molecule.\n    *   Symmetry elements:\n        *   A C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n        *   A C2 axis passing through the centers of opposing C-C bonds of the central benzene ring. Since there is a C3 axis, there must be three C2 axes.\n        *   A horizontal mirror plane (σh) coincident with the molecular plane.\n        *   Three vertical mirror planes (σv).\n    *   Point Group: Since it has a C3 axis, three C2 axes perpendicular to it, and a σh plane, its point group is **D3h**.\n\n4.  **Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone (D)**:\n    *   Structure: This molecule is derived from triphenylene, a planar aromatic hydrocarbon with D3h symmetry.

Let's analyze the symmetry of each molecule.\n\nThe C3h point group requires two essential symmetry elements:\n1.  A principal axis of rotation of order 3 (a C3 axis), which means the molecule looks the same after a 120° rotation.\n2.  A horizontal mirror plane (a σh plane) that is perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n\nA molecule with C3h symmetry must not have higher symmetry, such as three C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis (which would make it D3 or D3h) or vertical mirror planes (which would make it C3v).\n\nLet's examine each option:\n\n**A) Quinuclidine**\n*   **Structure**: This is a bicyclic amine, 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. It has a cage-like structure.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis**: There is a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposing bridgehead carbon atom (CH group). The molecule can be rotated by 120° about this axis and remain unchanged. Additionally, there are three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain this C3 axis and one of the three ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges.\n*   **Point Group**: The presence of a C3 axis and three σv planes defines the point group as **C3v**.

The presence of a C3 axis and three perpendicular C2 axes makes the point group at least D3.\n*   **Point Group**: Combining the D3 elements with the horizontal mirror plane (σh) results in the **D3h** point group. This is a higher symmetry group than C3h.\n\n**D) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n*   **Structure**: This is the common chemical mellitic trianhydride.

The molecule is flexible due to the rotation around B-O and O-C bonds.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis**: The B(O)3 core is trigonal planar. We need to consider the conformation of the three isopropyl groups. While the lowest energy conformation is likely a C3 \"propeller\" shape, it is possible for the molecule to adopt a higher-symmetry conformation.\n    *   Consider a conformation where the B and the three O atoms lie in a plane. This plane can act as a σh plane. For this to be true, each of the three isopropyl groups must be arranged symmetrically with respect to this plane.\n    *   This can be achieved if, for each isopropyl group, the central carbon (C_a) and the hydrogen attached to it (C_a-H) also lie in the B-O plane, with the two methyl groups (-CH3) positioned symmetrically, one above the plane and one below.\n    *   In this specific conformation, there is a C3 axis perpendicular to the B(O)3 plane.\n    *   The plane containing the B, O, C_a, and H atoms is a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n    *   Crucially, this conformation does *not* have any vertical mirror planes (σv) or any C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n*   **Point Group**: The combination of a C3 axis and a σh plane, with no other symmetry elements, defines the point group as **C3h**. Although this may not be the lowest-energy conformer, it is a possible conformation, and this molecule is the only one among the options whose point group can be exactly C3h.

It consists of a central benzene ring with three anhydride groups fused to alternate pairs of C-C bonds (C1-C2, C3-C4, C5-C6).\n*   **Symmetry Analysis**:\n    *   This is a planar molecule, so it possesses a **σh** plane.\n    *   It has a **C3** axis through the center of the benzene ring, perpendicular to the plane.\n    *   A careful check reveals it also possesses three **C2 axes** perpendicular to the C3 axis. These C2 axes pass through the midpoints of the C-C bonds of the benzene ring that are *not* part of the anhydride fusions (i.e., the C2-C3, C4-C5, and C6-C1 bonds). Rotating by 180 degrees around one of these axes maps the molecule onto itself.\n*   **Conclusion**: Like molecule B, this molecule's point group is **D3h**.\n\n**Note on D3h vs. C3h**: A question asking \"which molecule has C3h symmetry?\" is best interpreted as \"which molecule's point group *is* C3h?\". Molecules with D3h symmetry contain the symmetry elements of C3h, but their full symmetry is described by the D3h group, not the C3h subgroup. Since two options (B and D) are D3h, and one (A) is C3v, the answer must be C.\n\n**C) Triisopropyl borate (B(O-iPr)3)**\n*   **Structure**: A central boron atom is bonded to three oxygen atoms. Each oxygen is bonded to an isopropyl group (-CH(CH3)2). The molecule is flexible due to free rotation around the B-O and O-C single bonds.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis**: This case requires considering different possible conformations. A common analogy is made with boric acid, B(OH)3.\n    *   Boric acid, B(OH)3, is planar and has a C3 axis. While a high-symmetry D3h conformation exists, the commonly cited point group is **C3h**. This is because a lower-energy conformation involves a slight propeller-like twist of the O-H bonds within the molecular plane. This twist preserves the C3 axis and the σh plane (the plane of the molecule) but destroys the perpendicular C2 axes.\n    *   We can apply the same reasoning to triisopropyl borate. We consider a conformation where the bulky isopropyl groups are treated as discs. The molecule can be arranged with a planar B-O3 core, providing a **σh** plane and a **C3** axis.\n    *   To minimize steric hindrance, the three isopropyl groups will adopt a propeller-like arrangement. This \"twist\" breaks the C2 symmetry that would pass through the B-O bonds.\n    *   Therefore, this conformation lacks perpendicular C2 axes and σv planes but retains the C3 axis and the σh plane.\n*   **Conclusion**: Triisopropyl borate can adopt a conformation belonging to the **C3h** point group. It is the only molecule among the choices whose point group is C3h.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\n*   A) quinuclidine: C3v\n*   B) triphenylene derivative: D3h\n*   C) triisopropyl borate: **C3h**\n*   D) benzene derivative: D3h\n\nThe molecule with C3h symmetry is triisopropyl borate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry.\n\n**1. Understand C3h Symmetry**\n\nThe C3h point group describes a specific set of symmetry elements that a molecule possesses. A molecule belongs to the C3h point group if it has:\n*   A **C3 axis of rotation**: The molecule looks identical after a rotation of 360/3 = 120 degrees around this axis.\n*   A **σh mirror plane**: This is a horizontal mirror plane that is perpendicular to the principal C3 axis.\n*   It must **not** have other symmetry elements, such as vertical mirror planes (σv) or perpendicular C2 axes, that would place it in a higher symmetry group (like C3v or D3h).\n\nThe operations in the C3h group are E (identity), C3 (120° rotation), C3² (240° rotation), σh (horizontal reflection), S3 (120° rotation then reflection), and S3⁵ (240° rotation then reflection).\n\n**2. Analyze Each Molecule**\n\n**A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n*   **Structure:** This is a large, planar molecule. The core is triphenylene (D3h symmetry), to which three anhydride-like rings are fused symmetrically on the outer edges.\n*   **C3 axis?** Yes. An axis perpendicular to the molecular plane passing through the center. A 120° rotation leaves the molecule unchanged.\n*   **σh plane?** Yes. Since the molecule is planar, the plane of the molecule itself serves as a horizontal mirror plane.\n*   **Other elements?** Yes. Due to its high symmetry, it also has three C2 axes lying in the molecular plane, passing through the center of the molecule. The presence of these C2 axes perpendicular to the principal C3 axis means the molecule belongs to the **D3h** point group, not C3h.\n\n**B) triisopropyl borate (B(OCH(CH3)2)3)**\n*   **Structure:** A central boron atom is bonded to three isopropoxy groups. Boron is typically trigonal planar (sp2 hybridized). To minimize steric hindrance, the molecule adopts a specific low-energy conformation.\n*   **Conformation for C3h symmetry:** Let's consider a conformation where the B atom, the three O atoms, the three adjacent C atoms, and their attached H atoms (from the -CH moiety) all lie in a single plane. For each isopropyl group, the two methyl (-CH3) groups are arranged symmetrically, one above this plane and one below.\n*   **C3 axis?** Yes. An axis perpendicular to this plane, passing through the central Boron atom. A 120° rotation maps each isopropoxy group onto the next one.\n*   **σh plane?** Yes. The plane containing the B, O, C, and H atoms is a horizontal mirror plane. Reflecting through this plane swaps the \"top\" methyl group with the \"bottom\" methyl group for each of the three isopropyl substituents, leaving the overall molecule unchanged.\n*   **Other elements?** No. There are no vertical mirror planes (σv) or C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis. For instance, a 180° rotation around an axis passing through one of the B-O bonds would not map the other two isopropyl groups onto each other.\n*   Therefore, this molecule, in its stable conformation, belongs to the **C3h** point group.\n\n**C) quinuclidine**\n*   **Structure:** A bicyclic amine, 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. It has a cage-like structure with a nitrogen atom at one bridgehead and a C-H group at the other.\n*   **C3 axis?** Yes. The axis passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposite bridgehead carbon atom.\n*   **σh plane?** No. A horizontal plane perpendicular to the C3 axis would have to pass through the middle of the C-C bonds connecting the two ends. Reflection through this plane would map the nitrogen atom onto the position of the carbon atom, which are different. Thus, there is no σh.\n*   **Other elements?** Yes, it has three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis.\n*   The presence of a C3 axis and three σv planes (and the absence of σh) means quinuclidine belongs to the **C3v** point group.\n\n**D) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n*   **Structure:** Also known as Mellitic Anhydride. It's a planar molecule with a central benzene ring fused to three anhydride rings.\n*   **C3 axis?** Yes. Perpendicular to the molecular plane through the center of the benzene ring.\n*   **σh plane?** Yes. The plane of the molecule is a horizontal mirror plane.\n*   **Other elements?** Yes. Like molecule A, it has three C2 axes in the molecular plane, perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n*   Therefore, this molecule belongs to the **D3h** point group, not C3h.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis, only triisopropyl borate has a stable conformation that belongs to the C3h point group. The other molecules belong to either D3h or C3v point groups.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThe user wants me to identify the molecule with C3h symmetry from the given list. I will analyze the symmetry of each molecule to determine its point group.\n\n**Analysis of each molecule's symmetry:**\n\n1.  **triisopropyl borate (B(OCH(CH3)2)3):**\n    *   The central boron atom is bonded to three isopropoxy groups. The B(O)3 core is trigonal planar. This suggests a principal C3 axis perpendicular to the B(O)3 plane.\n    *   The isopropyl groups (-CH(CH3)2) are bulky. Due to steric hindrance, they will likely adopt a propeller-like conformation. In this conformation, the molecule possesses a C3 axis.\n    *   However, for C3h symmetry, a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the C3 axis is required. Such a plane would have to contain the Boron and the three Oxygen atoms. The isopropyl groups, with their out-of-plane methyl groups and hydrogens, would need to be reflected through this plane. This is not possible; the molecule lacks a σh plane. The most likely point group due to the propeller arrangement is C3.\n\n2.  **quinuclidine (C7H13N):**\n    *   This is a bicyclic amine with the nitrogen atom at one bridgehead and a CH group at the other.\n    *   There is a C3 axis of rotation that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposing bridgehead carbon atom. Rotating the molecule by 120° around this axis results in an indistinguishable conformation.\n    *   There are three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis and one of the three -(CH2)2- bridges.\n    *   The presence of a C3 axis and three σv planes means the molecule belongs to the **C3v** point group. It does not have C3h symmetry as it lacks the required horizontal mirror plane.\n\n3.  **benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone:**\n    *   This molecule is commonly known as mellitic trianhydride.\n    *   The molecule is completely planar.\n    *   It has a central C3 axis of rotation perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n    *   It also has a horizontal mirror plane (σh) which is the plane of the molecule itself.\n    *   Any planar molecule with a Cn axis (n>1) perpendicular to the plane must have a σh plane and thus belongs to the Cnh point group.\n    *   Therefore, this molecule possesses **C3h** symmetry. The symmetry elements are the identity (E), the C3 axis, and the σh plane, which together generate the S3 improper rotation axis.\n\n4.  **triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone:**\n    *   This molecule is an anhydride derived from triphenylene. It is structurally related to the mellitic trianhydride but based on a larger, non-planar triphenylene core.\n    *   Triphenylene itself is planar and has D3h symmetry. However, the fusion of the anhydride groups puckers the structure. The outer benzene rings are twisted out of the plane of the central ring, creating a propeller-like, helical shape.\n    *   This helical structure possesses a C3 axis of rotation through the center of the molecule.\n    *   However, because of the twisting, it lacks any mirror planes (neither σh nor σv). It also lacks any C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n    *   A molecule with only a Cn axis belongs to the Cn point group. Therefore, this molecule has **C3** symmetry.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone is the only molecule in the list that possesses C3h symmetry.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n*   **Analysis of the Molecules**\n\n    To determine which molecule has C3h symmetry, we need to analyze the symmetry elements of each molecule. The C3h point group is characterized by having a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to that axis. It does not have vertical mirror planes (σv) or perpendicular C2 axes.\n\n    1.  **triisopropyl borate (B(O-iPr)3)**\n        *   **Structure:** This molecule has a central boron atom bonded to three isopropoxy groups (-OCH(CH3)2). The B and the three O atoms form a trigonal planar B(O)3 core.\n        *   **Symmetry Analysis:** A C3 axis passes through the boron atom, perpendicular to the B(O)3 plane. The molecule's symmetry depends on the conformation of the three isopropyl groups, which can rotate around the B-O bonds.\n        *   A specific, stable conformation exists where the molecule possesses a horizontal mirror plane (σh) that is coincident with the B(O)3 plane. In this conformation, for each isopropyl group, the central C-H bond lies within the σh plane, and the two methyl groups are positioned symmetrically, one above and one below the plane.\n        *   This conformation has a C3 axis and a σh plane. It lacks vertical mirror planes and C2 axes perpendicular to the principal axis. Therefore, triisopropyl borate can adopt a conformation that belongs to the **C3h** point group. This is a classic textbook example of C3h symmetry.\n\n    2.  **quinuclidine (C7H13N)**\n        *   **Structure:** This is a bicyclic amine, specifically 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. It has a cage-like structure with a nitrogen atom at one bridgehead and a CH group at the other.\n        *   **Symmetry Analysis:** A C3 axis passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposing bridgehead carbon atom. The molecule also possesses three vertical mirror planes (σv) that pass through the C3 axis and one of the three ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges. It lacks a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n        *   The presence of a C3 axis and three σv planes means the point group of quinuclidine is **C3v**.\n\n    3.  **benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n        *   **Structure:** This is the systematic name for mellitic trianhydride (C12O9). It consists of a central benzene ring fused with three anhydride groups.\n        *   **Symmetry Analysis:** The molecule is planar. The C3 axis passes through the center of the benzene ring, perpendicular to the molecular plane. The plane of the molecule itself acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Additionally, there are three C2 axes in the plane of the molecule, and three vertical mirror planes (σv).\n        *   Because it has C3, σh, C2 (perpendicular), and σv elements, the point group is **D3h**. While a D3h molecule contains the elements of C3h symmetry, its overall point group is higher.\n\n    4.  **triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n        *   **Structure:** This is a larger analog of mellitic trianhydride, based on a triphenylene core. Triphenylene itself is a planar, highly symmetric molecule (D3h). The addition of three symmetric anhydride groups maintains the high symmetry.\n        *   **Symmetry Analysis:** Similar to mellitic trianhydride, this large molecule is expected to be planar. It will possess a C3 axis, a horizontal mirror plane (σh), perpendicular C2 axes, and vertical mirror planes. Its point group is also **D3h**.\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n\n    Comparing the point groups:\n    *   A: D3h\n    *   B: C3h (in a stable conformation)\n    *   C: C3v\n    *   D: D3h\n\n    The question asks which molecule has C3h symmetry.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core task is to identify which molecule has C3h symmetry. A molecule belonging to the C3h point group must possess:\n*   A C3 rotational axis (rotation by 120° results in an identical molecule).\n*   A horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n*   It must *not* have additional symmetry elements that would place it in a higher symmetry group. Specifically, it should lack vertical mirror planes (σv) and C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n\n### **2. Analyze Each Molecule**\n\nLet's analyze the symmetry of each option based on the provided candidate answers and fundamental chemical principles. The options are:\n*   **A) triisopropyl borate**\n*   **B) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n*   **C) quinuclidine**\n*   **D) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone** (also known as mellitic trianhydride)\n\n#### **C) Quinuclidine**\n*   **Structure:** A rigid, cage-like molecule.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** There is a strong consensus among the candidate answers (e.g., answers 1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 10). It has a C3 axis passing through the two bridgehead atoms (N and CH). It also has three vertical mirror planes (σv). It does *not* have a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n*   **Conclusion:** The point group is **C3v**. This molecule is not C3h.\n\n#### **D) Benzo[...]hexaone (Mellitic trianhydride)**\n*   **Structure:** A rigid, planar molecule with a central benzene ring fused to three anhydride rings.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** Most analyses agree it has a C3 axis and a σh plane (the molecular plane). However, a key point of disagreement is the presence of other symmetry elements. A detailed look at the structure reveals three C2 axes lying within the molecular plane, perpendicular to the C3 axis. These axes bisect the C-C bonds of the central ring that are not part of an anhydride group.\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of C3, σh, and three perpendicular C2 axes places this molecule in the **D3h** point group. While it *contains* the symmetry elements of C3h, its full point group is higher. In such questions, one seeks the molecule whose point group *is* C3h. So, this is likely an incorrect answer.\n\n#### **B) Triphenyleno[...]hexaone**\n*   **Structure:** A large molecule based on a triphenylene core.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** There's a debate about its planarity. Some agents assume it is planar, leading to a D3h point group (for the same reasons as the benzo- derivative). Other agents correctly point out that severe steric hindrance between adjacent anhydride groups would force the molecule to twist into a non-planar, propeller-like shape. In this more likely conformation, it would have a C3 axis and three perpendicular C2 axes but would lack any mirror planes.\n*   **Conclusion:** The point group is either **D3** (if twisted) or **D3h** (if hypothetically planar). In neither case is the point group C3h.\n\n#### **A) Triisopropyl borate**\n*   **Structure:** A flexible molecule with a central trigonal planar BO3 core.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** This is the most complex case due to conformational flexibility, but it's a classic textbook example. While it can exist in a low-energy \"propeller\" conformation of C3 symmetry, it can readily adopt a conformation that perfectly fits the C3h point group. In this conformation:\n    1.  The B atom, three O atoms, and the three attached C atoms (of the CH group) all lie in one plane. This plane acts as the σh mirror plane.\n    2.  An axis perpendicular to this plane, through the boron atom, is the C3 axis.\n    3.  For each isopropyl group, one methyl group is above the plane and the other is below, arranged symmetrically.\n    4.  This conformation has a C3 axis and a σh plane, but it lacks perpendicular C2 axes and vertical σv planes.\n*   **Conclusion:** The point group is **C3h**. It is the only option whose point group can be precisely C3h.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n*   Quinuclidine is C3v.\n*   Benzo[...]hexaone is D3h.\n*   Triphenyleno[...]hexaone is D3 or D3h.\n*   Triisopropyl borate is the only molecule that belongs to the C3h point group.\n\n<<<A>>>"

A molecule whose point group is a supergroup of C3h (e.g., D3h) also possesses C3h symmetry.\n\n### **2. Analyze Each Molecule**\n\nLet's examine the structure and symmetry of each option.\n\n**A) triisopropyl borate (B(OCH(CH3)2)3)**\n*   **Structure:** It has a central boron atom bonded to three isopropoxy groups. The B and the three oxygen atoms prefer a trigonal planar arrangement (the BO3 core).\n*   **Symmetry:** Due to the steric bulk of the three isopropyl groups, they cannot all lie flat in the same plane. To minimize steric repulsion, they twist out of the BO3 plane in a concerted, propeller-like fashion.\n*   **Point Group:** This propeller conformation has a C3 axis passing through the boron atom, perpendicular to the BO3 plane. However, it lacks any mirror planes, including a horizontal one (σh), because reflecting across the BO3 plane would not result in an identical molecule. Therefore, its point group is **C3**. It does not have C3h symmetry.\n\n**D) quinuclidine (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane)**\n*   **Structure:** This is a rigid, bicyclic amine with a cage-like structure. It has a nitrogen atom and a CH group at opposite bridgehead positions.\n*   **Symmetry:** There is a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposing bridgehead carbon and hydrogen. There are also three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain this C3 axis and one of the three ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges.\n*   **Point Group:** The combination of a C3 axis and three σv planes defines the **C3v** point group. It does not have a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n\n**C) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n*   **Structure:** This molecule consists of a triphenylene core with three anhydride groups fused to its \"bay\" regions. Triphenylene itself is a large, planar aromatic system.\n*   **Symmetry:** While one might expect this large fused system to be planar, there is significant steric hindrance between the carbonyl groups of the adjacent anhydride rings. This strain forces the molecule to distort from planarity, twisting into a non-planar, helical, propeller-like shape.\n*   **Point Group:** This twisted structure loses its horizontal mirror plane (σh). It retains the C3 axis and three C2 axes perpendicular to it. Its point group is **D3**. It does not have C3h symmetry.\n\n**B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n*   **Structure:** This molecule, also known as mellitic trianhydride, consists of a central benzene ring with three anhydride groups fused to it.\n*   **Symmetry:** Unlike the larger triphenylene derivative, this molecule is small enough that it can maintain a perfectly planar structure.\n    *   It has a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane, passing through the center of the benzene ring.\n    *   Because the molecule is planar, the plane of the molecule itself serves as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n*   **Point Group:** The presence of both a C3 axis and a perpendicular σh plane means the molecule has at least C3h symmetry. In fact, it also has three C2 axes lying within the plane, making its full point group **D3h**. Since the D3h group contains all the symmetry elements of the C3h group, this molecule possesses C3h symmetry.\n\n### **3.

Rotating the molecule by 120° (360°/3) about this axis leaves it unchanged.\n    *   **σh plane (horizontal mirror plane):** A mirror plane perpendicular to the principal C3 axis. Reflecting the molecule through this plane leaves it unchanged.\n    *   The C3h point group also contains an S3 improper rotation axis and an identity element (E). The presence of a C3 axis and a σh plane is sufficient to define the C3h point group.\n\n2.  **Examine the structure and symmetry of each molecule.**\n\n    *   **A) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone:** This molecule is also known as mellitic trianhydride.

The entire molecule is planar.\n        *   It has a C3 axis passing through the center of the benzene ring, perpendicular to the molecular plane. A 120° rotation leaves the molecule unchanged.\n        *   It has three C2 axes lying in the plane of the molecule, passing through opposite C-C bonds of the central ring.\n        *   It has a σh plane, which is the plane of the molecule itself.\n        *   It also has three σv planes (vertical mirror planes) that contain the C3 axis.\n        *   The combination of a C3 axis, three C2 axes perpendicular to it, and a σh plane places this molecule in the **D3h** point group, not C3h.\n\n    *   **B) triisopropyl borate:** The chemical formula is B(O-iPr)3, where iPr is the isopropyl group, -CH(CH3)2. Boron is the central atom, bonded to three oxygen atoms. Each oxygen is bonded to an isopropyl group.\n        *   The B(OC)3 core is planar due to sp2 hybridization of the boron atom. A C3 axis passes through the boron atom, perpendicular to this BO3 plane.\n        *   To minimize steric hindrance, the three isopropyl groups will arrange themselves in a propeller-like fashion. The C-H bond of the isopropyl group (the one attached to oxygen) will lie roughly in the BO3 plane, and the two methyl groups of each isopropyl will be positioned one above and one below the plane.\n        *   Let's check for the C3h symmetry elements:\n            *   **C3 axis:** Yes, the axis passing through the boron atom perpendicular to the BO3 plane is a C3 axis. Rotating the molecule 120° around this axis exchanges the positions of the three -O-iPr groups.\n            *   **σh plane:** Let's consider the plane containing the B and three O atoms as a potential horizontal mirror plane. For this to be a σh plane, reflecting through it must leave the molecule unchanged. If we reflect one isopropyl group through this plane, the methyl group above the plane moves to the position of the methyl group below the plane, and vice versa. This operation leaves each isopropyl group, and thus the entire molecule, unchanged.\n        *   Since the molecule possesses both a C3 axis and a σh plane perpendicular to it, it belongs to the **C3h** point group.\n\n    *   **C) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone:** This is a large, planar, polycyclic aromatic molecule. It is built from a central triphenylene core.\n        *   Due to its planarity and propeller-like shape, it possesses a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n        *   However, like molecule A, it also has three C2 axes in the plane of the molecule.\n        *   The plane of the molecule acts as a σh plane.\n        *   The combination of C3, three perpendicular C2 axes, and a σh plane places this molecule in the **D3h** point group.\n\n    *   **D) quinuclidine:** This is a bicyclic amine with the formula C7H13N. It has a cage-like structure with the nitrogen and a CH group at the bridgehead positions.\n        *   A C3 axis passes through the N atom and the opposing C-H bridgehead.\n        *   There are three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis and one of the -(CH2)2- bridges.\n        *   The molecule does not have a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the C3 axis. Reflection through such a plane would move the nitrogen atom to the CH group's position, which is not an equivalent configuration.\n        *   Therefore, quinuclidine belongs to the **C3v** point group.\n\n3.  **Conclusion.**\n    Based on the analysis, only triisopropyl borate has the required C3 axis and a perpendicular σh plane, correctly assigning it to the C3h point group.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the symmetry of each molecule to determine which one belongs to the C3h point group.\n\nThe C3h point group is characterized by the presence of a principal threefold axis of rotation (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the C3 axis. The presence of these two elements automatically implies the existence of a threefold axis of improper rotation (S3).\n\n1.  **Quinuclidine (A)**\n    *   **Structure:** Quinuclidine (C7H13N) is a bicyclic amine with a cage-like structure. The nitrogen atom and a CH group are at the two bridgehead positions.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n        *   There is a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposing bridgehead carbon-hydrogen bond.\n        *   There are three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain this C3 axis and one of the three ethylenic (-CH2-CH2-) bridges.\n        *   The combination of a C3 axis and three σv planes defines the **C3v** point group. It does not have a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Thus, it is not C3h.\n\n2.  **Triisopropyl borate (B)**\n    *   **Structure:** Triisopropyl borate, B(OCH(CH3)2)3, has a central boron atom bonded to three isopropoxy groups.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n        *   The BO3 core is likely to be trigonal planar, which would allow for a C3 axis perpendicular to this plane.\n        *   For the molecule to have C3h symmetry, a horizontal mirror plane (σh) must exist, which would coincide with the BO3 plane.\n        *   Let's examine an isopropoxy group, -OCH(CH3)2. For the σh plane to be a symmetry element, the group must be symmetric upon reflection through this plane. If the C-H bond of the isopropyl group lies in the plane, one methyl group (-CH3) would be above the plane and the other below. Reflection would swap their positions, but a methyl group is not a mirror image of another methyl group in this configuration. The atoms within the methyl groups would not map onto each other.\n        *   Due to the steric bulk and free rotation of the isopropyl groups, the molecule is likely to adopt a \"propeller\" conformation (point group C3) or a conformation with no symmetry at all (point group C1) to minimize steric strain. A C3h conformation is sterically unfavorable and geometrically impossible.\n\n3.  **Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (D)**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule is more commonly known as mellitic trianhydride. It consists of a central benzene ring to which three dicarboxylic anhydride groups are fused, forming a planar molecule.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n        *   The molecule is planar, so it has a horizontal mirror plane (σh) which is the plane of the molecule.\n        *   There is a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane, passing through the center of the benzene ring.\n        *   In addition, there are three C2 axes lying in the plane of the molecule, each passing through the center and bisecting the sides of the central benzene ring that are not part of the anhydride fusions.\n        *   The presence of a C3 axis with three perpendicular C2 axes means the molecule belongs to the D3 family. The presence of a σh plane makes the point group **D3h**.\n        *   While D3h contains all the symmetry elements of C3h, the question asks for the molecule that *has* C3h symmetry, which implies assigning the highest point group. The point group for this molecule is D3h, not C3h.\n\n4.  **Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone (C)**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule is a trianhydride derivative of triphenylene. It consists of a planar triphenylene core with three anhydride groups fused to its outer bays. The entire molecule is planar.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n        *   The molecule is planar, so it possesses a horizontal mirror plane (σh) that is the molecular plane itself.\n        *   It has a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane, passing through the center of the molecule.\n        *   Let's check for other symmetry elements. Unlike mellitic trianhydride (D) or triphenylene itself, this molecule does not possess any C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis, nor does it have any vertical mirror planes (σv). The \"propeller-like\" arrangement of the anhydride groups around the core breaks these symmetries.\n        *   The only symmetry elements are the identity (E), C3 rotation, and the horizontal mirror plane (σh) (which also implies an S3 improper rotation). This set of symmetry elements defines the **C3h** point group.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Quinuclidine: C3v\n*   Triisopropyl borate: Not C3h (likely C3 or C1)\n*   Triphenyleno[...]hexaone: **C3h**\n*   Benzo[...]hexaone: D3h\n\nTherefore, the molecule that has C3h symmetry is triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the symmetry of each molecule to determine which one belongs to the C3h point group.\n\nThe C3h point group requires two key symmetry elements:\n1.  A **C3 axis**: A threefold axis of rotation. Rotating the molecule by 360°/3 = 120° around this axis leaves the molecule indistinguishable.\n2.  A **σh plane**: A horizontal mirror plane that is perpendicular to the principal C3 axis. Reflection through this plane leaves the molecule indistinguishable.\n\nCrucially, a molecule in the C3h point group must *not* have additional symmetry elements like vertical mirror planes (σv) or perpendicular C2 axes, which would place it in a higher symmetry group like D3h or D3d.\n\nLet's examine each option:\n\n**A) Triisopropyl borate (B(O-iPr)3)**\n*   **Structure**: A central boron atom is bonded to three oxygen atoms in a trigonal planar arrangement. Each oxygen is bonded to an isopropyl group, -CH(CH3)2.\n*   **Flexibility**: This molecule is conformationally flexible due to free rotation around the B-O and O-C bonds. We need to see if a conformation with C3h symmetry is possible.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis**:\n    *   Let's place the central boron atom at the origin and the three oxygen atoms in the xy-plane. The axis perpendicular to this plane (the z-axis) is a potential C3 axis.\n    *   For the xy-plane to be a σh mirror plane, each of the three isopropyl groups must be arranged symmetrically with respect to it.\n    *   This can be achieved if, for each isopropyl group, the central carbon and its attached hydrogen (-CH) lie within the xy-plane. The two methyl (-CH3) groups attached to that carbon would then be positioned symmetrically, one above the plane and one below.\n    *   If all three isopropyl groups adopt this orientation, arranged 120° apart around the boron, the entire molecule would possess a C3 axis and a σh plane.\n    *   Let's check for other symmetry elements in this specific conformation. There would be no vertical mirror planes (σv) or perpendicular C2 axes.\n    *   Therefore, a plausible, albeit perhaps not the lowest-energy, conformation of triisopropyl borate exists that belongs to the **C3h** point group.\n\n**B) Quinuclidine (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane)**\n*   **Structure**: This is a rigid, cage-like bicyclic amine.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis**:\n    *   There is a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposing bridgehead carbon-hydrogen (C-H) group.\n    *   There are three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis and pass through one of the three ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges.\n    *   There is no horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n    *   The presence of a C3 axis and three σv planes defines the point group as **C3v**.\n\n**C) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n*   **Structure**: This is the chemical name for mellitic trianhydride (C12O9). It is a rigid, planar molecule consisting of a central benzene ring fused with three anhydride groups.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis**:\n    *   Being planar, the plane of the molecule acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n    *   There is a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane, passing through the center of the benzene ring.\n    *   However, the molecule also possesses three C2 axes lying within the molecular plane and three vertical mirror planes (σv) that contain the C3 axis.\n    *   These combined symmetry elements place the molecule in the **D3h** point group, which is a higher symmetry group than C3h.\n\n**D) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n*   **Structure**: This is a larger analogue of mellitic trianhydride, built upon a triphenylene core. It is also a rigid, planar molecule.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis**:\n    *   Similar to mellitic trianhydride, this molecule is planar and possesses a C3 axis, a σh plane, three perpendicular C2 axes, and three vertical σv planes.\n    *   Its point group is also **D3h**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nOf the four options, quinuclidine (C3v), mellitic trianhydride (D3h), and the triphenylene derivative (D3h) have rigid structures that do not belong to the C3h point group. Only triisopropyl borate is conformationally flexible, and a specific, high-symmetry conformation exists that perfectly fits the C3h point group requirements.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry. The C3h point group is characterized by the presence of a principal C3 axis of rotation and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to it. It does not contain any vertical mirror planes (σv) or C2 axes perpendicular to the principal axis.\n\n1.  **Analyze Quinuclidine (A)**\n    *   **Structure**: Quinuclidine is a bicyclic amine with the formula C7H13N. It has a cage-like structure with a nitrogen atom at one bridgehead and a CH group at the other. The two bridgeheads are connected by three ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges.\n    *   **Symmetry Elements**:\n        *   There is a C3 axis passing through the nitrogen atom and the opposing bridgehead carbon.\n        *   There are three vertical mirror planes (σv), each passing through the C3 axis and bisecting one of the ethylene bridges.\n    *   **Point Group**: The combination of a C3 axis and three σv planes defines the **C3v** point group. It lacks a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Therefore, it does not have C3h symmetry.\n\n2.  **Analyze Triisopropyl borate (B)**\n    *   **Structure**: The formula is B(O-i-Pr)3, which is B(OCH(CH3)2)3. A central boron atom is bonded to three oxygen atoms, and each oxygen is bonded to an isopropyl group. The B-O3 core is trigonal planar.\n    *   **Symmetry Elements**:\n        *   There is a C3 axis passing through the boron atom, perpendicular to the plane formed by the three oxygen atoms.\n        *   To minimize steric hindrance, the molecule can adopt a specific conformation. In this conformation, the plane containing the boron and the three oxygen atoms acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n        *   For this to be a σh plane, each isopropyl group [-CH(CH3)2] must be oriented symmetrically with respect to this plane. This is achieved if the C-H bond of the isopropyl group lies within the plane, with one methyl group positioned above the plane and the other below it.\n        *   The C3 rotation maps each of the three identical isopropyl groups onto the next.\n        *   The σh reflection swaps the \"up\" and \"down\" methyl groups on each isopropyl group, leaving the molecule unchanged.\n    *   **Point Group**: The molecule possesses a C3 axis and a σh plane, but it lacks any C2 axes perpendicular to C3 or any σv planes. This corresponds exactly to the **C3h** point group.\n\n3.  **Analyze Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone (C)**\n    *   **Structure**: This is a large, complex molecule with a triphenylene core fused to three anhydride rings.\n    *   **Symmetry Elements**: Due to severe steric hindrance between the adjacent anhydride groups, the molecule is not planar. It twists into a propeller-like shape.\n        *   This propeller shape has a C3 axis of rotation passing through the center of the molecule, perpendicular to the general plane.\n        *   However, because of the twisting, it loses all mirror planes (both σh and σv) and any C2 axes.\n    *   **Point Group**: With only a C3 axis, the point group is **C3**.\n\n4.  **Analyze Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (D)**\n    *   **Structure**: This compound is more commonly known as mellitic trianhydride. It consists of a central benzene ring fused to three dicarboxylic anhydride rings.\n    *   **Symmetry Elements**:\n        *   The molecule is completely planar.\n        *   There is a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n        *   The molecular plane itself is a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n        *   There are three C2 axes lying within the molecular plane, passing through the center and bisecting opposite bonds of the central benzene ring.\n        *   There are also three vertical mirror planes (σv) that contain the C3 axis.\n    *   **Point Group**: The combination of C3, 3 C2, σh, and 3 σv defines the **D3h** point group. While a D3h molecule contains all the symmetry elements of the C3h group (C3 and σh), its full symmetry is higher. In point group classification, the highest possible symmetry group is used.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Quinuclidine is C3v.\n*   Triisopropyl borate is C3h.\n*   The triphenylene derivative is C3.\n*   The benzo derivative (mellitic trianhydride) is D3h.\n\nThe question asks which molecule has C3h symmetry.

The B(O)₃ core is trigonal planar.\n        *   Symmetry elements: The isopropyl groups (-CH(CH₃)₂) are not planar and can rotate around the B-O and O-C bonds. Due to steric hindrance, the most stable conformation is likely a \"propeller\" shape where all three isopropyl groups are twisted in the same direction.\n        *   This propeller conformation would possess a C₃ rotational axis passing through the boron atom, perpendicular to the B(O)₃ plane.\n        *   However, it lacks a horizontal mirror plane (σh) because reflecting the atoms of the isopropyl groups (which are out of the B(O)₃ plane) across this plane does not result in an identical configuration. The atoms above the plane would be mapped to empty space below the plane.\n        *   Therefore, its point group is most likely C₃, not C₃h.\n\n    2.  **B) Quinuclidine (1-Azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane)**:\n        *   Structure: A rigid bicyclic amine with a cage-like structure.\n        *   Symmetry elements: There is a C₃ rotational axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposing bridgehead carbon atom (CH).\n        *   There are also three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C₃ axis and pass through the middle of one of the three -(CH₂)₂- bridges.\n        *   The presence of a C₃ axis and three σv planes defines the C₃v point group.\n        *   It does not have a horizontal mirror plane (σh).

The presence of these two elements automatically implies the existence of an S3 improper rotation axis.\n\nLet's examine the symmetry of each molecule:\n\n1.  **Quinuclidine (A)**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a bicyclic molecule with a nitrogen atom at one bridgehead and a CH group at the other. These two bridgeheads are connected by three equivalent -(CH2)2- bridges.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n        *   There is a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposite bridgehead carbon atom.\n        *   There are three vertical mirror planes (σv), each containing the C3 axis and bisecting one of the ethylene bridges.\n        *   There is no horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The point group for quinuclidine is **C3v**.\n\n2.  **Triisopropyl borate (D)**\n    *   **Structure:** B(O-i-Pr)3. It has a central boron atom bonded to three oxygen atoms, each of which is bonded to an isopropyl group.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n        *   The B(O)3 core is trigonal planar. A C3 axis passes through the boron atom, perpendicular to the B(O)3 plane.\n        *   However, the isopropyl groups (-CH(CH3)2) are not planar. Due to steric hindrance, they will twist out of the plane, creating a propeller-like structure.\n        *   This propeller conformation retains the C3 axis but destroys the horizontal mirror plane (σh). Reflecting the methyl groups of an isopropyl group through the B(O)3 plane does not result in an equivalent configuration.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The most stable conformation of triisopropyl borate has **C3** symmetry, not C3h.\n\n3.  **Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (C)**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule has a central benzene ring to which three maleic anhydride-like rings are symmetrically fused. This is an oxide of carbon (C12O9). The molecule is planar.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n        *   As the molecule is planar, it possesses a horizontal mirror plane (σh), which is the molecular plane itself.\n        *   There is a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane, passing through the center of the benzene ring.\n        *   In addition, there are three C2 axes lying within the molecular plane, each passing through the midpoints of opposite C-C bonds of the central benzene ring.\n        *   The presence of a C3 axis, three perpendicular C2 axes, and a σh plane makes the point group D3h.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The point group is **D3h**. While a D3h object contains all the symmetry elements of C3h, its symmetry is higher.\n\n4.  **Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone (B)**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule has a central triphenylene core. Three anhydride rings are fused to the outer rings of the triphenylene system in a symmetric fashion. The molecule is planar.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n        *   Being planar, the molecule has a horizontal mirror plane (σh), which is the plane of the molecule.\n        *   There is a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane, passing through the center of the triphenylene core.\n        *   Let's check for other symmetry elements. There are no C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis because the \"corners\" of the molecule are not equivalent to the \"bays\". There are also no vertical mirror planes (σv).\n        *   The molecule's symmetry is fully described by the C3 axis and the σh plane.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The point group is exactly **C3h**.\n\n**Final Comparison:**\n\n*   (A) Quinuclidine: C3v\n*   (B) Triphenyleno[...]hexaone: **C3h**\n*   (C) Benzo[...]hexaone: D3h\n*   (D) Triisopropyl borate: C3\n\nThe only molecule whose highest symmetry point group is C3h is triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the symmetry of each molecule to determine which one belongs to the C3h point group. The C3h point group requires a principal three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the C3 axis, but no other symmetry elements like perpendicular C2 axes or vertical mirror planes.\n\n1.  **A) triisopropyl borate (B(OCH(CH3)2)3)**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule has a central boron atom bonded to three isopropoxy groups. The BO3 core is trigonal planar.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n        *   There is a C3 axis passing through the boron atom, perpendicular to the plane of the three oxygen atoms.\n        *   Due to the steric bulk of the isopropyl groups (-CH(CH3)2), they twist out of the BO3 plane in a propeller-like fashion. This conformation maintains the C3 axis.\n        *   However, there is no horizontal mirror plane (σh). The plane containing the B and O atoms cannot be a mirror plane because the non-planar isopropyl groups do not have a corresponding mirrored image. Reflecting an isopropyl group through this plane does not result in an identical group.\n        *   Therefore, the point group of triisopropyl borate is **C3**.\n\n2.  **C) quinuclidine (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane)**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a cage-like molecule with a bridgehead nitrogen atom and a bridgehead carbon atom, connected by three ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n        *   There is a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposite bridgehead carbon atom.\n        *   There are three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each pass through the C3 axis and one of the ethylene bridges.\n        *   A molecule with a C3 axis and three σv planes belongs to the C3v point group.\n        *   There is no horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n        *   Therefore, the point group of quinuclidine is **C3v**.\n\n3.  **D) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the chemical name for **mellitic trianhydride**. It consists of a central benzene ring with three five-membered anhydride rings fused to it, one across each pair of adjacent carbons (C1-C2, C3-C4, C5-C6).\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n        *   The entire molecule is planar. The plane of the molecule is a mirror plane (σh).\n        *   There is a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane, passing through the center of the benzene ring. Rotating the molecule by 120° leaves it unchanged.\n        *   Let's check for other symmetry elements that would place it in a higher symmetry group.\n        *   There are no C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis. An axis passing through the midpoint of the C2-C3 bond, for example, would not be a symmetry element because one side of the axis has an anhydride ring while the other does not.\n        *   There are no vertical mirror planes (σv). A plane containing the C3 axis would have to cut through the anhydride rings and would not reflect one side onto the other.\n        *   Since the molecule has a C3 axis and a σh plane, and no further symmetry elements, its point group is **C3h**.\n\n4.  **B) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule is a derivative of triphenylene, which consists of four fused benzene rings in a disc-like shape. Three anhydride rings are fused to the three outer benzene rings of the triphenylene core.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n        *   The molecule is planar, so it has a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n        *   It has a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n        *   However, unlike mellitic trianhydride, it has additional symmetry. Because of the D3h symmetry of the parent triphenylene core, this molecule also has three C2 axes lying in the molecular plane and three vertical mirror planes (σv).\n        *   A molecule with C3, σh, 3 C2 (perpendicular), and 3 σv belongs to the **D3h** point group.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Molecule A has C3 symmetry.\n*   Molecule B has D3h symmetry.\n*   Molecule C has C3v symmetry.\n*   Molecule D has C3h symmetry.\n\nThe question asks which molecule has C3h symmetry. Molecule D's point group is precisely C3h. While a molecule with D3h symmetry (Molecule B) contains all the symmetry operations of the C3h group, the question is best interpreted as asking for the molecule whose full set of symmetries is described by the C3h point group.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nTo determine which molecule has C3h symmetry, we need to analyze the symmetry elements of each molecule. The C3h point group requires a C3 axis of rotation and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to it.\n\n1.  **Quinuclidine (C)**:\n    *   Structure: A bicyclic amine, 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. It has a cage-like structure.\n    *   Symmetry elements: It possesses a C3 axis passing through the nitrogen atom and the opposite CH group. It also has three vertical mirror planes (σv) containing the C3 axis.\n    *   Point Group: **C3v**. It lacks the horizontal mirror plane (σh) required for C3h symmetry.\n\n2.  **Triisopropyl borate (B)**:\n    *   Structure: B(O-iPr)3. It has a central boron atom bonded to three isopropoxy groups.\n    *   Symmetry: Due to the free rotation of the isopropyl groups, the molecule typically exists in a low-symmetry conformation. Even in a high-symmetry \"propeller-like\" conformation, the non-planar nature of the isopropyl groups prevents the existence of a horizontal mirror plane. The point group is most likely C3. It lacks the σh plane.\n\n3.  **Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (A)**:\n    *   Structure: This is Mellitic anhydride. It is a planar molecule.\n    *   Symmetry elements:\n        *   A C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n        *   A C2 axis passing through the centers of opposing C-C bonds of the central benzene ring. Since there is a C3 axis, there must be three C2 axes.\n        *   A horizontal mirror plane (σh) coincident with the molecular plane.\n        *   Three vertical mirror planes (σv).\n    *   Point Group: Since it has a C3 axis, three C2 axes perpendicular to it, and a σh plane, its point group is **D3h**.\n\n4.  **Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone (D)**:\n    *   Structure: This molecule is derived from triphenylene, a planar aromatic hydrocarbon with D3h symmetry. Fused furan rings with carbonyl groups (anhydride groups) are added in a symmetrical fashion. The resulting molecule is also planar.\n    *   Symmetry elements:\n        *   A C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n        *   A horizontal mirror plane (σh) coincident with the molecular plane.\n    *   Let's check for other symmetry elements. There are no C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis. There are also no vertical mirror planes (σv).\n    *   The molecule possesses only a C3 axis and a σh plane (and an S3 axis which is a consequence of C3 and σh).\n    *   Point Group: **C3h**.\n\nTherefore, triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone is the molecule with C3h symmetry.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis question asks to identify which of the given molecules possesses C3h symmetry. Let's analyze the symmetry of each molecule.\n\nThe C3h point group requires two essential symmetry elements:\n1.  A principal axis of rotation of order 3 (a C3 axis), which means the molecule looks the same after a 120° rotation.\n2.  A horizontal mirror plane (a σh plane) that is perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n\nA molecule with C3h symmetry must not have higher symmetry, such as three C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis (which would make it D3 or D3h) or vertical mirror planes (which would make it C3v).\n\nLet's examine each option:\n\n**A) Quinuclidine**\n*   **Structure**: This is a bicyclic amine, 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. It has a cage-like structure.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis**: There is a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposing bridgehead carbon atom (CH group). The molecule can be rotated by 120° about this axis and remain unchanged. Additionally, there are three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain this C3 axis and one of the three ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges.\n*   **Point Group**: The presence of a C3 axis and three σv planes defines the point group as **C3v**. This is not C3h.\n\n**B) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n*   **Structure**: This is a large, planar aromatic molecule. It consists of a triphenylene core with three anhydride rings fused symmetrically to its outer edges.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis**: The molecule is planar, and its overall shape is trigonal.\n    *   It has a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane, passing through the center of the molecule.\n    *   Because it is planar, the molecular plane itself acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n    *   It also possesses three C2 axes lying within the molecular plane, passing through the center of the molecule and the center of each outer fused ring system. The presence of a C3 axis and three perpendicular C2 axes makes the point group at least D3.\n*   **Point Group**: Combining the D3 elements with the horizontal mirror plane (σh) results in the **D3h** point group. This is a higher symmetry group than C3h.\n\n**D) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n*   **Structure**: This is the common chemical mellitic trianhydride. It is a planar molecule consisting of a central benzene ring fused with three anhydride rings.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis**: Similar to option B, this molecule is planar and highly symmetric.\n    *   It has a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane.\n    *   The molecular plane is a σh plane.\n    *   It has three C2 axes in the molecular plane that pass through the center of the molecule and bisect the bonds connecting the anhydride groups.\n*   **Point Group**: For the same reasons as molecule B, the point group is **D3h**. This is not C3h.\n\n**C) triisopropyl borate**\n*   **Structure**: The formula is B(O-iPr)3, or B(OCH(CH3)2)3. It has a central boron atom bonded to three isopropoxy groups. The molecule is flexible due to the rotation around B-O and O-C bonds.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis**: The B(O)3 core is trigonal planar. We need to consider the conformation of the three isopropyl groups. While the lowest energy conformation is likely a C3 \"propeller\" shape, it is possible for the molecule to adopt a higher-symmetry conformation.\n    *   Consider a conformation where the B and the three O atoms lie in a plane. This plane can act as a σh plane. For this to be true, each of the three isopropyl groups must be arranged symmetrically with respect to this plane.\n    *   This can be achieved if, for each isopropyl group, the central carbon (C_a) and the hydrogen attached to it (C_a-H) also lie in the B-O plane, with the two methyl groups (-CH3) positioned symmetrically, one above the plane and one below.\n    *   In this specific conformation, there is a C3 axis perpendicular to the B(O)3 plane.\n    *   The plane containing the B, O, C_a, and H atoms is a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n    *   Crucially, this conformation does *not* have any vertical mirror planes (σv) or any C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n*   **Point Group**: The combination of a C3 axis and a σh plane, with no other symmetry elements, defines the point group as **C3h**. Although this may not be the lowest-energy conformer, it is a possible conformation, and this molecule is the only one among the options whose point group can be exactly C3h. The other molecules have rigid structures with point groups C3v or D3h.\n\nTherefore, triisopropyl borate is the molecule that has C3h symmetry.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry.\n\n**1. Understand the C3h Point Group**\n\nA molecule belongs to the C3h point group if it possesses the following symmetry elements:\n*   **E**: The identity element (doing nothing).\n*   **C3**: A principal axis of rotation. Rotating the molecule by 360/3 = 120 degrees around this axis leaves it unchanged.\n*   **σh**: A horizontal mirror plane perpendicular to the C3 axis. Reflection through this plane leaves the molecule unchanged.\n*   The presence of C3 and σh automatically implies the presence of an **S3** improper rotation axis (rotation by 120 degrees followed by reflection in the σh plane).\n\nCrucially, a molecule in the C3h group must *not* have perpendicular C2 axes or vertical mirror planes (σv), as these would place it in a higher symmetry group like D3h.\n\n**2. Analyze Each Molecule**\n\n**A) Quinuclidine (C7H13N)**\n*   **Structure**: A bicyclic cage-like amine. It consists of a cyclohexane skeleton with a nitrogen atom bridging the carbons at positions 1 and 4.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis**:\n    *   It has a C3 axis passing through the nitrogen atom and the opposite CH group.\n    *   It does *not* have a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to this axis because the \"top\" of the molecule (the N atom) is different from the \"bottom\" (the CH group). The molecule is not planar at its equator.\n    *   It does have three vertical mirror planes (σv) that contain the C3 axis.\n*   **Conclusion**: The point group is **C3v**.\n\n**B) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n*   **Structure**: This is a large, complex, planar molecule. It's based on a triphenylene core (which has D3h symmetry), with three identical furan-dione (anhydride-like) groups fused to it in a C3-symmetric manner.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis**:\n    *   Being a large, conjugated system, it is planar. The plane of the molecule is a **σh** plane.\n    *   It has a **C3** axis perpendicular to the molecular plane, passing through the center.\n    *   Due to the high symmetry of the triphenylene core and the symmetric placement of the fused rings, it also has three **C2 axes** perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n*   **Conclusion**: The presence of C3, σh, and perpendicular C2 axes places this molecule in the **D3h** point group.\n\n**D) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n*   **Structure**: This is the IUPAC name for mellitic trianhydride (C12O9). It consists of a central benzene ring with three anhydride groups fused to alternate pairs of C-C bonds (C1-C2, C3-C4, C5-C6).\n*   **Symmetry Analysis**:\n    *   This is a planar molecule, so it possesses a **σh** plane.\n    *   It has a **C3** axis through the center of the benzene ring, perpendicular to the plane.\n    *   A careful check reveals it also possesses three **C2 axes** perpendicular to the C3 axis. These C2 axes pass through the midpoints of the C-C bonds of the benzene ring that are *not* part of the anhydride fusions (i.e., the C2-C3, C4-C5, and C6-C1 bonds). Rotating by 180 degrees around one of these axes maps the molecule onto itself.\n*   **Conclusion**: Like molecule B, this molecule's point group is **D3h**.\n\n**Note on D3h vs. C3h**: A question asking \"which molecule has C3h symmetry?\" is best interpreted as \"which molecule's point group *is* C3h?\". Molecules with D3h symmetry contain the symmetry elements of C3h, but their full symmetry is described by the D3h group, not the C3h subgroup. Since two options (B and D) are D3h, and one (A) is C3v, the answer must be C.\n\n**C) Triisopropyl borate (B(O-iPr)3)**\n*   **Structure**: A central boron atom is bonded to three oxygen atoms. Each oxygen is bonded to an isopropyl group (-CH(CH3)2). The molecule is flexible due to free rotation around the B-O and O-C single bonds.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis**: This case requires considering different possible conformations. A common analogy is made with boric acid, B(OH)3.\n    *   Boric acid, B(OH)3, is planar and has a C3 axis. While a high-symmetry D3h conformation exists, the commonly cited point group is **C3h**. This is because a lower-energy conformation involves a slight propeller-like twist of the O-H bonds within the molecular plane. This twist preserves the C3 axis and the σh plane (the plane of the molecule) but destroys the perpendicular C2 axes.\n    *   We can apply the same reasoning to triisopropyl borate. We consider a conformation where the bulky isopropyl groups are treated as discs. The molecule can be arranged with a planar B-O3 core, providing a **σh** plane and a **C3** axis.\n    *   To minimize steric hindrance, the three isopropyl groups will adopt a propeller-like arrangement. This \"twist\" breaks the C2 symmetry that would pass through the B-O bonds.\n    *   Therefore, this conformation lacks perpendicular C2 axes and σv planes but retains the C3 axis and the σh plane.\n*   **Conclusion**: Triisopropyl borate can adopt a conformation belonging to the **C3h** point group. It is the only molecule among the choices whose point group is C3h.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\n*   A) quinuclidine: C3v\n*   B) triphenylene derivative: D3h\n*   C) triisopropyl borate: **C3h**\n*   D) benzene derivative: D3h\n\nThe molecule with C3h symmetry is triisopropyl borate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry.\n\n**1. Understand C3h Symmetry**\n\nThe C3h point group describes a specific set of symmetry elements that a molecule possesses. A molecule belongs to the C3h point group if it has:\n*   A **C3 axis of rotation**: The molecule looks identical after a rotation of 360/3 = 120 degrees around this axis.\n*   A **σh mirror plane**: This is a horizontal mirror plane that is perpendicular to the principal C3 axis.\n*   It must **not** have other symmetry elements, such as vertical mirror planes (σv) or perpendicular C2 axes, that would place it in a higher symmetry group (like C3v or D3h).\n\nThe operations in the C3h group are E (identity), C3 (120° rotation), C3² (240° rotation), σh (horizontal reflection), S3 (120° rotation then reflection), and S3⁵ (240° rotation then reflection).\n\n**2. Analyze Each Molecule**\n\n**A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n*   **Structure:** This is a large, planar molecule. The core is triphenylene (D3h symmetry), to which three anhydride-like rings are fused symmetrically on the outer edges.\n*   **C3 axis?** Yes. An axis perpendicular to the molecular plane passing through the center. A 120° rotation leaves the molecule unchanged.\n*   **σh plane?** Yes. Since the molecule is planar, the plane of the molecule itself serves as a horizontal mirror plane.\n*   **Other elements?** Yes. Due to its high symmetry, it also has three C2 axes lying in the molecular plane, passing through the center of the molecule. The presence of these C2 axes perpendicular to the principal C3 axis means the molecule belongs to the **D3h** point group, not C3h.\n\n**B) triisopropyl borate (B(OCH(CH3)2)3)**\n*   **Structure:** A central boron atom is bonded to three isopropoxy groups. Boron is typically trigonal planar (sp2 hybridized). To minimize steric hindrance, the molecule adopts a specific low-energy conformation.\n*   **Conformation for C3h symmetry:** Let's consider a conformation where the B atom, the three O atoms, the three adjacent C atoms, and their attached H atoms (from the -CH moiety) all lie in a single plane. For each isopropyl group, the two methyl (-CH3) groups are arranged symmetrically, one above this plane and one below.\n*   **C3 axis?** Yes. An axis perpendicular to this plane, passing through the central Boron atom. A 120° rotation maps each isopropoxy group onto the next one.\n*   **σh plane?** Yes. The plane containing the B, O, C, and H atoms is a horizontal mirror plane. Reflecting through this plane swaps the \"top\" methyl group with the \"bottom\" methyl group for each of the three isopropyl substituents, leaving the overall molecule unchanged.\n*   **Other elements?** No. There are no vertical mirror planes (σv) or C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis. For instance, a 180° rotation around an axis passing through one of the B-O bonds would not map the other two isopropyl groups onto each other.\n*   Therefore, this molecule, in its stable conformation, belongs to the **C3h** point group.\n\n**C) quinuclidine**\n*   **Structure:** A bicyclic amine, 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. It has a cage-like structure with a nitrogen atom at one bridgehead and a C-H group at the other.\n*   **C3 axis?** Yes. The axis passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposite bridgehead carbon atom.\n*   **σh plane?** No. A horizontal plane perpendicular to the C3 axis would have to pass through the middle of the C-C bonds connecting the two ends. Reflection through this plane would map the nitrogen atom onto the position of the carbon atom, which are different. Thus, there is no σh.\n*   **Other elements?** Yes, it has three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis.\n*   The presence of a C3 axis and three σv planes (and the absence of σh) means quinuclidine belongs to the **C3v** point group.\n\n**D) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n*   **Structure:** Also known as Mellitic Anhydride. It's a planar molecule with a central benzene ring fused to three anhydride rings.\n*   **C3 axis?** Yes. Perpendicular to the molecular plane through the center of the benzene ring.\n*   **σh plane?** Yes. The plane of the molecule is a horizontal mirror plane.\n*   **Other elements?** Yes. Like molecule A, it has three C2 axes in the molecular plane, perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n*   Therefore, this molecule belongs to the **D3h** point group, not C3h.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis, only triisopropyl borate has a stable conformation that belongs to the C3h point group. The other molecules belong to either D3h or C3v point groups.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThe user wants me to identify the molecule with C3h symmetry from the given list.

The B(O)3 core is trigonal planar. This suggests a principal C3 axis perpendicular to the B(O)3 plane.\n    *   The isopropyl groups (-CH(CH3)2) are bulky. Due to steric hindrance, they will likely adopt a propeller-like conformation. In this conformation, the molecule possesses a C3 axis.\n    *   However, for C3h symmetry, a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the C3 axis is required. Such a plane would have to contain the Boron and the three Oxygen atoms. The isopropyl groups, with their out-of-plane methyl groups and hydrogens, would need to be reflected through this plane. This is not possible; the molecule lacks a σh plane. The most likely point group due to the propeller arrangement is C3.\n\n2.  **quinuclidine (C7H13N):**\n    *   This is a bicyclic amine with the nitrogen atom at one bridgehead and a CH group at the other.\n    *   There is a C3 axis of rotation that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposing bridgehead carbon atom. Rotating the molecule by 120° around this axis results in an indistinguishable conformation.\n    *   There are three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis and one of the three -(CH2)2- bridges.\n    *   The presence of a C3 axis and three σv planes means the molecule belongs to the **C3v** point group. It does not have C3h symmetry as it lacks the required horizontal mirror plane.\n\n3.  **benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone:**\n    *   This molecule is commonly known as mellitic trianhydride.\n    *   The molecule is completely planar.\n    *   It has a central C3 axis of rotation perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n    *   It also has a horizontal mirror plane (σh) which is the plane of the molecule itself.\n    *   Any planar molecule with a Cn axis (n>1) perpendicular to the plane must have a σh plane and thus belongs to the Cnh point group.\n    *   Therefore, this molecule possesses **C3h** symmetry. The symmetry elements are the identity (E), the C3 axis, and the σh plane, which together generate the S3 improper rotation axis.\n\n4.  **triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone:**\n    *   This molecule is an anhydride derived from triphenylene. It is structurally related to the mellitic trianhydride but based on a larger, non-planar triphenylene core.\n    *   Triphenylene itself is planar and has D3h symmetry. However, the fusion of the anhydride groups puckers the structure. The outer benzene rings are twisted out of the plane of the central ring, creating a propeller-like, helical shape.\n    *   This helical structure possesses a C3 axis of rotation through the center of the molecule.\n    *   However, because of the twisting, it lacks any mirror planes (neither σh nor σv). It also lacks any C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n    *   A molecule with only a Cn axis belongs to the Cn point group. Therefore, this molecule has **C3** symmetry.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone is the only molecule in the list that possesses C3h symmetry.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n*   **Analysis of the Molecules**\n\n    To determine which molecule has C3h symmetry, we need to analyze the symmetry elements of each molecule. The C3h point group is characterized by having a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to that axis. It does not have vertical mirror planes (σv) or perpendicular C2 axes.\n\n    1.  **triisopropyl borate (B(O-iPr)3)**\n        *   **Structure:** This molecule has a central boron atom bonded to three isopropoxy groups (-OCH(CH3)2). The B and the three O atoms form a trigonal planar B(O)3 core.\n        *   **Symmetry Analysis:** A C3 axis passes through the boron atom, perpendicular to the B(O)3 plane. The molecule's symmetry depends on the conformation of the three isopropyl groups, which can rotate around the B-O bonds.\n        *   A specific, stable conformation exists where the molecule possesses a horizontal mirror plane (σh) that is coincident with the B(O)3 plane. In this conformation, for each isopropyl group, the central C-H bond lies within the σh plane, and the two methyl groups are positioned symmetrically, one above and one below the plane.\n        *   This conformation has a C3 axis and a σh plane. It lacks vertical mirror planes and C2 axes perpendicular to the principal axis. Therefore, triisopropyl borate can adopt a conformation that belongs to the **C3h** point group. This is a classic textbook example of C3h symmetry.\n\n    2.  **quinuclidine (C7H13N)**\n        *   **Structure:** This is a bicyclic amine, specifically 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. It has a cage-like structure with a nitrogen atom at one bridgehead and a CH group at the other.\n        *   **Symmetry Analysis:** A C3 axis passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposing bridgehead carbon atom. The molecule also possesses three vertical mirror planes (σv) that pass through the C3 axis and one of the three ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges. It lacks a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n        *   The presence of a C3 axis and three σv planes means the point group of quinuclidine is **C3v**.\n\n    3.  **benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n        *   **Structure:** This is the systematic name for mellitic trianhydride (C12O9). It consists of a central benzene ring fused with three anhydride groups.\n        *   **Symmetry Analysis:** The molecule is planar. The C3 axis passes through the center of the benzene ring, perpendicular to the molecular plane. The plane of the molecule itself acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Additionally, there are three C2 axes in the plane of the molecule, and three vertical mirror planes (σv).\n        *   Because it has C3, σh, C2 (perpendicular), and σv elements, the point group is **D3h**. While a D3h molecule contains the elements of C3h symmetry, its overall point group is higher.\n\n    4.  **triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n        *   **Structure:** This is a larger analog of mellitic trianhydride, based on a triphenylene core. Triphenylene itself is a planar, highly symmetric molecule (D3h). The addition of three symmetric anhydride groups maintains the high symmetry.\n        *   **Symmetry Analysis:** Similar to mellitic trianhydride, this large molecule is expected to be planar. It will possess a C3 axis, a horizontal mirror plane (σh), perpendicular C2 axes, and vertical mirror planes. Its point group is also **D3h**.\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n\n    Comparing the point groups:\n    *   A: D3h\n    *   B: C3h (in a stable conformation)\n    *   C: C3v\n    *   D: D3h\n\n    The question asks which molecule has C3h symmetry. Typically, this refers to the molecule whose point group is C3h. Only triisopropyl borate fits this description. The molecules with D3h symmetry have a higher level of symmetry.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
