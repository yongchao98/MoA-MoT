Let's break down its structure to identify its key features.\n    *   **`cyclohex`**: Indicates a six-membered carbon ring.\n    *   **`-3-ene`**: Indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) within the ring, starting at position 3 (between C3 and C4).\n    *   **`carboxylic acid`**: Indicates a -COOH group. As the principal functional group, it is located at position C1.\n    *   **`2-formyl`**: Indicates an aldehyde group (-CHO) at position C2.\n    *   **`5-vinyl`**: Indicates a vinyl group (-CH=CH2) at position C5.\n\n    From this structure, we can identify the features that contribute to the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), which is also known as the degree of unsaturation. IHD is the sum of the number of rings and the number of pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n    *   One ring (the cyclohexene ring): IHD +1\n    *   One C=C bond in the ring: IHD +1\n    *   One C=O bond in the carboxylic acid group: IHD +1\n    *   One C=O bond in the formyl group: IHD +1\n    *   One C=C bond in the vinyl group: IHD +1\n    *   Total IHD of the reactant = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n\n    We can also determine the molecular formula to verify this.\n    *   Carbons (C): 6 in the ring + 1 in COOH + 1 in CHO + 2 in vinyl = 10 carbons.\n    *   Hydrogens (H): After drawing the structure and ensuring each carbon has 4 bonds, we find there are 12 hydrogens. (C1(H), C2(H), C3(H), C4(H), C5(H), C6(H2), COOH(H), CHO(H), vinyl(H3)). Total H = 7 (on ring) + 5 (on substituents) = 12.\n    *   Oxygens (O): 2 in COOH + 1 in CHO = 3 oxygens.\n    *   Molecular Formula of reactant: C10H12O3.\n    *   IHD formula: IHD = C + 1 - H/2. (Oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation).\n    *   IHD(reactant) = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 11 - 6 = 5. This confirms the structural analysis.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the Reaction**\n    The reagent is red phosphorus and excess of HI (Red P + HI). This is a very strong reducing agent. It performs a complete reduction of most oxygen-containing functional groups and carbon-carbon multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated alkane forms.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   The formyl (aldehyde) group (-CHO) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   The C=C double bond in the cyclohexene ring will be reduced to a C-C single bond.\n    *   The C=C double bond in the vinyl group (-CH=CH2) will be reduced to an ethyl group (-CH2-CH3).\n    *   Importantly, the carbon-carbon single bonds of the ring are stable and will not be broken. The ring structure is preserved.\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the Structure and IHD of the Product**\n    The reaction reduces all pi bonds and removes all oxygen atoms, but it does not open the ring.\n    *   The product will be a saturated hydrocarbon.\n    *   The product will still contain the six-membered ring.\n    *   Since all C=C and C=O bonds are gone, the product will have zero pi bonds.\n\n    We can now calculate the IHD of the product based on its structure.\n    *   Number of rings = 1 (the cyclohexane ring remains).\n    *   Number of pi bonds = 0 (all have been reduced).\n    *   IHD(product) = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\n*   **Step 4: Verify with the Molecular Formula of the Product**\n    The starting material had a C10 skeleton, which is preserved. The product is therefore a C10 saturated cycloalkane (a substituted cyclohexane). The general formula for a monocyclic alkane is CnH2n.\n    *   Since n=10, the molecular formula of the product is C10H20.\n    *   Using the IHD formula: IHD = C + 1 - H/2.\n    *   IHD(product) = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\n    Both methods yield the same result.

It is known for the complete reduction of oxygen-containing functional groups and carbon-carbon multiple bonds.\n    *   Carboxylic acids (-COOH) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH3).\n    *   Aldehydes (-CHO) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH3).\n    *   Alkenes (C=C) are reduced to alkanes (C-C).\n    *   The ring structure itself (made of sigma bonds) is not broken under these conditions.\n\n**3. Determine the Product**\n\n*   Applying the reduction to the reactant:\n    *   The -COOH group at C1 is reduced to a -CH3 group.\n    *   The -CHO group at C2 is reduced to a -CH3 group.\n    *   The C=C double bond in the ring is reduced to a C-C single bond.\n    *   The C=C double bond in the vinyl group is reduced, converting it to an ethyl (-CH2CH3) group.\n*   The final product is **5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane**. This is a saturated molecule (contains only single bonds) with a ring structure.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\n*   We can determine the IHD of the product in two ways:\n\n    **Method 1: Based on the structural changes.**\n    The reaction removes all the pi bonds from the reactant.\n    *   Initial IHD = 5 (1 ring + 4 π bonds).\n    *   The 4 π bonds (one C=C in the ring, one C=C in vinyl, one C=O in formyl, one C=O in carboxylic acid) are all reduced (removed).\n    *   The ring structure remains.\n    *   Final IHD = Initial IHD - (number of π bonds removed)\n    *   Final IHD = 5 - 4 = 1.\n    *   The remaining IHD of 1 corresponds to the single ring in the product molecule.\n\n    **Method 2: Based on the molecular formula of the product.**\n    *   The product is 5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane.\n    *   The carbon skeleton is C10 (as determined for the reactant).\n    *   The product is a substituted cycloalkane.

The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, is calculated as the sum of the number of rings and the number of pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n\nFor the reactant:\n1.  **One ring** (the cyclohexene ring) contributes 1 to the IHD.\n2.  **One C=C double bond** within the ring contributes 1 to the IHD.\n3.  **One C=O double bond** in the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) contributes 1 to the IHD.\n4.  **One C=O double bond** in the formyl group (-CHO) contributes 1 to the IHD.\n5.  **One C=C double bond** in the vinyl group (-CH=CH2) contributes 1 to the IHD.\n\nSumming these up, the IHD of the reactant is 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C) + 1 (C=O) + 1 (C=O) + 1 (C=C) = **5**.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Reaction**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus (Red P) and an excess of HI (hydroiodic acid)**. This combination is a very powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. Its key functions are:\n\n*   It reduces aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) completely to the corresponding alkyl groups (-CH3).\n*   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n*   It does not typically break stable carbon-carbon single bonds, such as those in a cyclohexane ring.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Structure of the Product**\n\nThe reaction will reduce all the functional groups and double bonds in the starting molecule, leaving a fully saturated hydrocarbon skeleton.\n\n*   The **cyclohexene ring** will be reduced to a **cyclohexane ring** (the C=C becomes C-C).\n*   The **carboxylic acid group** at position 1 will be reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH3).\n*   The **formyl group** at position 2 will be reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH3).\n*   The **vinyl group** at position 5 will be reduced to an **ethyl group** (-CH2CH3).\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane, which is a saturated molecule. It contains no double or triple bonds.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nNow, we calculate the IHD for the final product.\n\nUsing the definition IHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds):\n*   **Number of rings**: The product still contains the six-membered cyclohexane ring. So, the number of rings is 1.\n*   **Number of π bonds**: All the double bonds (C=C and C=O) from the reactant have been reduced to single bonds. The product is fully saturated. So, the number of π bonds is 0.\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the product = 1 (ring) + 0 (π bonds) = **1**.\n\n**Alternative Method: Using Molecular Formula**\n\n1.  **Reactant Formula:** Let's find the molecular formula of the reactant (C10H12O3) to determine the number of carbons.\n    *   Ring: C6\n    *   -COOH: C1\n    *   -CHO: C1\n    *   -CH=CH2: C2\n    *   Total Carbons = 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10.\n2.  **Product Formula:** The reaction removes all oxygens and adds hydrogens to saturate the molecule, but the number of carbons remains the same (C=10). The product is a substituted cyclohexane. The general formula for a monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane) is CnH2n.

This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. Its effect is as follows:\n    *   It reduces carbonyl groups (like in aldehydes -CHO and carboxylic acids -COOH) completely to the corresponding alkane (CH3 group in this case).\n    *   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n    *   Essentially, it removes all oxygen atoms and saturates all pi bonds.\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the structure and formula of the product.**\n    We apply the effects of Red P/HI to our reactant:\n    *   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring (the C=C bond is reduced).\n    *   The `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) is reduced to a `methyl` group (-CH3).\n    *   The `formyl` group (-CHO) is reduced to a `methyl` group (-CH3).\n    *   The `vinyl` group (-CH=CH2) is reduced to an `ethyl` group (-CH2CH3).\n\n    The product is a saturated hydrocarbon with one ring. Specifically, it's an isomer of ethyl-dimethyl-cyclohexane.\n    Since the carbon skeleton is preserved, the product still has 10 carbon atoms.\n    The product is a saturated cycloalkane. The general formula for a saturated hydrocarbon with one ring is CnH2n.\n    Since our product has 10 carbons (n=10), its molecular formula must be C10H(2*10) = **C10H20**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product.**\n    The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, tells us the sum of the number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule. The formula is:\n    IHD = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1\n    Where C is the number of carbons, H is the number of hydrogens, and N is the number of nitrogens.\n\n    For our product with the formula C10H20:\n    *   C = 10\n    *   H = 20\n    *   N = 0\n    IHD = 10 - (20/2) + 0 + 1\n    IHD = 10 - 10 + 1\n    IHD = 1\n\n    Alternatively, we can find the IHD by inspecting the final structure.

This is a six-membered carbon ring with one double bond. This structure contributes an IHD of 1 (for the ring) + 1 (for the double bond) = 2.\n2.  **Substituents:**\n    *   **Carboxylic acid (-COOH)** at position 1. This group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), which adds 1 to the IHD.\n    *   **Formyl group (-CHO)** at position 2. This group is an aldehyde and contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), which adds 1 to the IHD.\n    *   **Vinyl group (-CH=CH2)** at position 5. This group contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), which adds 1 to the IHD.\n\n3.  **Total IHD of the Starting Material:**\n    *   IHD = (from ring) + (from C=C in ring) + (from C=O in COOH) + (from C=O in CHO) + (from C=C in vinyl)\n    *   IHD = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5\n\nTo confirm, let's determine the molecular formula of the starting material.\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 in the ring + 1 in COOH + 1 in CHO + 2 in vinyl = 10 carbons.\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** A detailed count gives H=12. (C1-H, C2-H, C3-H, C4-H, C5-H, C6-2H, COOH-H, CHO-H, Vinyl-3H = 1+1+1+1+1+2+1+1+3 = 12 hydrogens).\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 in COOH + 1 in CHO = 3 oxygens.\n*   The molecular formula is **C10H12O3**.\n*   Using the IHD formula: IHD = C - H/2 + 1 = 10 - 12/2 + 1 = 10 - 6 + 1 = 5. This matches our structural analysis.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Reaction\nThe reagent is **red phosphorus (Red P) and excess hydriodic acid (HI)**. This combination is a powerful reducing agent. Its effect on the functional groups present in the starting material is as follows:\n\n*   It reduces carboxylic acids (-COOH) completely to methyl groups (-CH3).\n*   It reduces aldehydes (-CHO) completely to methyl groups (-CH3).\n*   It reduces alkenes (C=C double bonds) to alkanes (C-C single bonds).\n\nIn this reaction, all double bonds (both C=C and C=O) will be saturated with hydrogen, and all oxygen atoms will be removed.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Structure and Formula of the Product\nThe reaction transforms the starting material:\n\n*   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring is reduced to a `cyclohexane` ring.\n*   The `-COOH` group at C1 is reduced to a `-CH3` group.\n*   The `-CHO` group at C2 is reduced to a `-CH3` group.\n*   The `-CH=CH2` group at C5 is reduced to an ethyl group `(-CH2-CH3)`.\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane (specifically, 1-ethyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohexane, though the exact isomerism doesn't affect the molecular formula). The product is a **saturated monocyclic alkane**.\n\n1.  **Carbon Atoms (C):** The number of carbon atoms does not change during the reduction. The product still has **10 carbons**.\n2.  **Hydrogen Atoms (H):** The general formula for a saturated monocyclic alkane is CnH2n. Since our product has 10 carbon atoms, its formula is C10H(2*10) = **C10H20**.\n3.  **Oxygen Atoms (O):** All oxygens are removed.\n\nThe molecular formula of the product is **C10H20**.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, can be calculated using the molecular formula. The formula is:\n\nIHD = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1\n\nFor a hydrocarbon (containing only C and H), this simplifies to:\n\nIHD = C - H/2 + 1\n\nPlugging in the values for the product (C=10, H=20):\n\nIHD = 10 - 20/2 + 1\nIHD = 10 - 10 + 1\nIHD = 1\n\nAlternatively, we can reason from the structure.

Add substituents by replacing H atoms on the ring:\n        *   At C1, add -COOH: Replace one H. C1 now has 1H left.\n        *   At C2, add -CHO: Replace one H. C2 now has 1H left.\n        *   At C5, add -CH=CH2: Replace one H. C5 now has 1H left.\n    3.  Count the hydrogens on the ring carbons: 1(on C1) + 1(on C2) + 1(on C3) + 1(on C4) + 1(on C5) + 2(on C6) = 7 H.\n    4.  Count the hydrogens on the substituent groups: 1(in -COOH) + 1(in -CHO) + 3(in -CH=CH2) = 5 H.\n    5.

Since the carbon skeleton is preserved, the product has 10 carbon atoms. The product is a saturated monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane). The general formula for a cycloalkane is CnH2n.\nTherefore, the molecular formula of the product is **C10H20**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), or degree of unsaturation, for a molecule can be calculated using the formula:\nIHD = (2C + 2 - H - X + N) / 2\nwhere C is the number of carbons, H is hydrogens, X is halogens, and N is nitrogens.\n\nFor the product with the formula **C10H20**:\nIHD = (2 * 10 + 2 - 20) / 2\nIHD = (20 + 2 - 20) / 2\nIHD = 2 / 2\nIHD = 1\n\nAlternatively, the IHD can be determined from the structure of the product. The product is a substituted cyclohexane. It contains:\n*   One ring (contributes 1 to IHD).\n*   Zero double or triple bonds (contributes 0 to IHD).\nSo, the total IHD of the product is 1.\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the final product is 1.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\n*   **Step 1: Identify the starting material and its structure.**\n    The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

The vinyl group (-CH=CH2) at C5 is reduced to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n\n    The final product is a substituted cyclohexane. The carbon skeleton is maintained, so the product will have 10 carbon atoms. Since all functional groups and double bonds are reduced, the product is a saturated monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane). The specific product would be 4-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane.\n\n    A saturated monocyclic alkane has the general formula **CnH2n**.\n    Since our product has 10 carbon atoms (C=10), its molecular formula will be **C10H(2*10) = C10H20**.\n\n*   **Step 5: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product.**\n    The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (also known as the degree of unsaturation) can be calculated using the molecular formula.

So, the number of rings = 1.\n*   **Pi Bonds:** All double bonds (both C=C and C=O) have been reduced to single bonds. So, the number of pi bonds = 0.\n\nIHD of the product = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nThe correct answer is 1, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nAn explanation has already been generated.\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, for the product is calculated.\n\n1.  **Initial Reactant:** 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n2.  **Reaction:** The reaction with red phosphorus and excess HI is a complete reduction. This reaction reduces all multiple bonds (C=C, C=O) to single bonds and removes all oxygen-containing functional groups, converting them to their corresponding alkane parts.\n3.  **Product:**\n    *   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a saturated `cyclohexane` ring.\n    *   The `2-formyl` group (-CHO) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   The `5-vinyl` group (-CH=CH₂) is reduced to an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   The `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   The final product is 1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane.\n4.  **IHD of the Product:** The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency is calculated by the formula: IHD = (number of rings) + (number of pi bonds).\n    *   The product molecule, 1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane, has one ring (the cyclohexane ring).\n    *   It has zero pi bonds as all double bonds have been saturated.\n    *   Therefore, IHD = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nThe IHD of the final product is 1.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, is a calculation that determines the total number of rings and pi bonds within a molecule. The formula for IHD is:\nIHD = C - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 + 1\nwhere C, H, X, and N are the number of carbon, hydrogen, halogen, and nitrogen atoms, respectively. Oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation.\n\n**1. Identify the Reactant and Reagents:**\n*   **Reactant:** 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus and excess hydriodic acid (Red P / HI).\n\n**2. Determine the Molecular Formula of the Reactant:**\n*   The parent structure is `cyclohex-3-ene`: a 6-carbon ring with one double bond.\n*   Substituents are:\n    *   `carboxylic acid` (-COOH): adds 1 C, 1 H, and 2 O.\n    *   `formyl` group (-CHO): adds 1 C, 1 H, and 1 O.\n    *   `vinyl` group (-CH=CH₂): adds 2 C and 3 H.\n*   Let's count the atoms:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (in the ring) + 1 (in -COOH) + 1 (in -CHO) + 2 (in -CH=CH₂) = 10 carbons.\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (in -COOH) + 1 (in -CHO) = 3 oxygens.\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** A saturated 6-membered ring would have 12 hydrogens (C₆H₁₂). The double bond in the ring removes 2 H. Attaching the four substituents removes 4 H. So, H on the ring is 12 - 2 - 4 = 6. The hydrogens from the substituents are 1 (in -COOH), 1 (in -CHO), and 3 (in the vinyl group). Total H = 6 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 11. Let's re-verify H count by drawing the structure.\n        *   C1(COOH), C2(CHO), C3=C4, C5(Vinyl), C6.\n        *   H at C1=1, H at C2=1, H at C3=1, H at C4=1, H at C5=1, H at C6=2. Ring H = 7.\n        *   H in COOH = 1. H in CHO = 1. H in Vinyl(-CH=CH₂) = 3.\n        *   Total H = 7 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12.\n    *   The molecular formula of the reactant is **C₁₀H₁₂O₃**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Reaction:**\nThe combination of red phosphorus and excess HI is a very strong reducing agent. It will:\n*   Reduce aldehydes and carboxylic acids completely to alkane groups. (-CHO → -CH₃; -COOH → -CH₃).\n*   Reduce all carbon-carbon double bonds to single bonds (C=C → C-C).\n*   Remove all oxygen atoms from the molecule.\n*   The ring structure remains intact.\n\n**4. Determine the Product's Structure and Molecular Formula:**\n*   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring is hydrogenated to a `cyclohexane` ring.\n*   The `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The `formyl` group (-CHO) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The `vinyl` group (-CH=CH₂) is hydrogenated to an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n*   The carbon skeleton of C₁₀ remains the same.\n*   The resulting product is a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon (a substituted cyclohexane). The general formula for a cycloalkane is CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   Since there are 10 carbon atoms (n=10), the molecular formula of the product is **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\n**5. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product:**\n*   Using the molecular formula C₁₀H₂₀:\n    IHD = C - H/2 + 1 = 10 - (20/2) + 1 = 10 - 10 + 1 = 1.\n\n*   Alternatively, from the product's structure: The product is a cyclohexane ring with substituents. It contains **one ring** and **zero pi bonds**. Each ring contributes 1 to the IHD. Therefore, the IHD is 1.\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the final product is 1.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the structure of the reactant\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down its structure based on the name:\n*   **cyclohex-**: The molecule has a six-membered carbon ring.\n*   **-carboxylic acid**: There is a principal functional group, -COOH, attached to the ring. By IUPAC convention, its position is C1.\n*   **-3-ene**: There is a carbon-carbon double bond (a π-bond) in the ring between C3 and C4.\n*   **2-formyl**: An aldehyde group (-CHO) is attached to C2 of the ring. This group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (a π-bond).\n*   **5-vinyl**: A vinyl group (-CH=CH2) is attached to C5 of the ring. This group contains a carbon-carbon double bond (a π-bond).\nThe -COOH group itself also contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (a π-bond).\n\nSo, structurally, the reactant molecule contains:\n*   1 ring.\n*   4 π-bonds (one in the cyclohexene ring, one in the vinyl group, one in the formyl group, and one in the carboxylic acid group).\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the reactant is the sum of rings and π-bonds, which is 1 (ring) + 4 (π-bonds) = 5.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the chemical reaction and the transformation\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus (Red P) and excess HI**. This is a very strong reducing agent. It performs the following reductions:\n*   Reduces all carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n*   Reduces all carbonyl groups (C=O) in aldehydes and carboxylic acids completely to alkane parts (CH2 or CH3).\n*   Specifically, R-CHO is reduced to R-CH3.\n*   Specifically, R-COOH is reduced to R-CH3.\n\nIn essence, all π-bonds in the molecule are removed, and all oxygen atoms are eliminated. The carbon skeleton, including the ring, remains intact.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the structure of the product\nApplying the effects of the Red P/HI reduction to our reactant:\n*   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a saturated `cyclohexane` ring. The π-bond in the ring is gone.\n*   The `2-formyl` group (-CHO) becomes a methyl group (-CH3). The C=O π-bond is gone.\n*   The `5-vinyl` group (-CH=CH2) becomes an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The C=C π-bond is gone.\n*   The `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) becomes a methyl group (-CH3). The C=O π-bond is gone.\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane molecule. All functional groups containing π-bonds have been fully saturated. The only feature contributing to the index of hydrogen deficiency is the ring structure itself.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency is given by the formula:\nIHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π-bonds)\n\nFor the product molecule:\n*   Number of rings = 1 (the cyclohexane ring is preserved).\n*   Number of π-bonds = 0 (all double bonds were reduced).\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the product is:\nIHD = 1 + 0 = 1\n\nAlternatively, we can determine the molecular formula of the product.\n*   Reactant C atoms: 6 (ring) + 1 (COOH) + 1 (CHO) + 2 (vinyl) = 10 carbons.\n*   The reaction does not change the number of carbon atoms. So, the product has 10 carbons.\n*   The product is a substituted cyclohexane, which is a saturated monocyclic alkane. The general formula for such compounds is CnH2n.\n*   With n=10, the product's molecular formula is C10H20.\n*   Using the IHD formula for a molecular formula (C_c H_h O_o N_n X_x):\n    IHD = c - h/2 + n/2 + 1\n    IHD = 10 - 20/2 + 0/2 + 1 = 10 - 10 + 1 = 1.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

This is a six-membered carbon ring with one double bond. This structure contributes an IHD of 1 (for the ring) + 1 (for the double bond) = 2.\n2.  **Substituents:**\n    *   **Carboxylic acid (-COOH)** at position 1. This group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), which adds 1 to the IHD.\n    *   **Formyl group (-CHO)** at position 2. This group is an aldehyde and contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), which adds 1 to the IHD.\n    *   **Vinyl group (-CH=CH2)** at position 5. This group contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), which adds 1 to the IHD.\n\n3.  **Total IHD of the Starting Material:**\n    *   IHD = (from ring) + (from C=C in ring) + (from C=O in COOH) + (from C=O in CHO) + (from C=C in vinyl)\n    *   IHD = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5\n\nTo confirm, let's determine the molecular formula of the starting material.\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 in the ring + 1 in COOH + 1 in CHO + 2 in vinyl = 10 carbons.\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** A detailed count gives H=12. (C1-H, C2-H, C3-H, C4-H, C5-H, C6-2H, COOH-H, CHO-H, Vinyl-3H = 1+1+1+1+1+2+1+1+3 = 12 hydrogens).\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 in COOH + 1 in CHO = 3 oxygens.\n*   The molecular formula is **C10H12O3**.\n*   Using the IHD formula: IHD = C - H/2 + 1 = 10 - 12/2 + 1 = 10 - 6 + 1 = 5. This matches our structural analysis.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Reaction\nThe reagent is **red phosphorus (Red P) and excess hydriodic acid (HI)**. This combination is a powerful reducing agent. Its effect on the functional groups present in the starting material is as follows:\n\n*   It reduces carboxylic acids (-COOH) completely to methyl groups (-CH3).\n*   It reduces aldehydes (-CHO) completely to methyl groups (-CH3).\n*   It reduces alkenes (C=C double bonds) to alkanes (C-C single bonds).\n\nIn this reaction, all double bonds (both C=C and C=O) will be saturated with hydrogen, and all oxygen atoms will be removed.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Structure and Formula of the Product\nThe reaction transforms the starting material:\n\n*   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring is reduced to a `cyclohexane` ring.\n*   The `-COOH` group at C1 is reduced to a `-CH3` group.\n*   The `-CHO` group at C2 is reduced to a `-CH3` group.\n*   The `-CH=CH2` group at C5 is reduced to an ethyl group `(-CH2-CH3)`.\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane (specifically, 1-ethyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohexane, though the exact isomerism doesn't affect the molecular formula). The product is a **saturated monocyclic alkane**.\n\n1.  **Carbon Atoms (C):** The number of carbon atoms does not change during the reduction. The product still has **10 carbons**.\n2.  **Hydrogen Atoms (H):** The general formula for a saturated monocyclic alkane is CnH2n. Since our product has 10 carbon atoms, its formula is C10H(2*10) = **C10H20**.\n3.  **Oxygen Atoms (O):** All oxygens are removed.\n\nThe molecular formula of the product is **C10H20**.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, can be calculated using the molecular formula. The formula is:\n\nIHD = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1\n\nFor a hydrocarbon (containing only C and H), this simplifies to:\n\nIHD = C - H/2 + 1\n\nPlugging in the values for the product (C=10, H=20):\n\nIHD = 10 - 20/2 + 1\nIHD = 10 - 10 + 1\nIHD = 1\n\nAlternatively, we can reason from the structure. The product is a saturated alkane framework containing a single ring. Each ring in a molecule contributes 1 to the IHD.

Determine the Structure and Molecular Formula of the Reactant**\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**.\n\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: This is a six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbon-3 and carbon-4.\n*   **carboxylic acid**: This is the principal functional group (-COOH), so it is located at position C1.\n*   **2-formyl**: An aldehyde group (-CHO) is at position C2.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A vinyl group (-CH=CH2) is at position C5.\n\nLet's determine the number of atoms to find the molecular formula.\n*   **Carbon atoms (C):**\n    *   6 carbons in the cyclohexene ring.\n    *   1 carbon in the carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   1 carbon in the formyl group (-CHO).\n    *   2 carbons in the vinyl group (-CH=CH2).\n    *   Total Carbons (C) = 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10.\n\n*   **Hydrogen atoms (H):**\n    We start with a cyclohexane ring (C6H12) and make modifications.\n    1.  Create a double bond between C3 and C4 (cyclohex-3-ene): C6H10. The H count on each carbon is: C1(2H), C2(2H), C3(1H), C4(1H), C5(2H), C6(2H).\n    2.  Add substituents by replacing H atoms on the ring:\n        *   At C1, add -COOH: Replace one H. C1 now has 1H left.\n        *   At C2, add -CHO: Replace one H. C2 now has 1H left.\n        *   At C5, add -CH=CH2: Replace one H. C5 now has 1H left.\n    3.  Count the hydrogens on the ring carbons: 1(on C1) + 1(on C2) + 1(on C3) + 1(on C4) + 1(on C5) + 2(on C6) = 7 H.\n    4.  Count the hydrogens on the substituent groups: 1(in -COOH) + 1(in -CHO) + 3(in -CH=CH2) = 5 H.\n    5.  Total Hydrogens (H) = 7 (ring) + 5 (substituents) = 12.\n\n*   **Oxygen atoms (O):**\n    *   2 oxygens in the carboxylic acid group.\n    *   1 oxygen in the formyl group.\n    *   Total Oxygens (O) = 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nThe molecular formula of the reactant is **C10H12O3**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Red phosphorus and excess of HI (Red P/HI).\n*   **Type of Reaction:** This is a very strong reduction reaction. It reduces virtually all oxygen-containing functional groups and multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated hydrocarbon parts.\n    *   Alkene (C=C) → Alkane (C-C)\n    *   Aldehyde (-CHO) → Methyl group (-CH3)\n    *   Carboxylic acid (-COOH) → Methyl group (-CH3)\n*   The reaction will preserve the carbon skeleton. The six-membered ring will not be opened under typical conditions.\n\n**3. Determine the Product**\n\nThe reaction reduces all points of unsaturation and functional groups in the starting material:\n*   The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring.\n*   The vinyl group (-CH=CH2) becomes an ethyl group (-CH2-CH3).\n*   The formyl group (-CHO) becomes a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) becomes a methyl group (-CH3).\n\nThe product is a substituted cyclohexane. Since the carbon skeleton is preserved, the product has 10 carbon atoms. The product is a saturated monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane). The general formula for a cycloalkane is CnH2n.\nTherefore, the molecular formula of the product is **C10H20**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), or degree of unsaturation, for a molecule can be calculated using the formula:\nIHD = (2C + 2 - H - X + N) / 2\nwhere C is the number of carbons, H is hydrogens, X is halogens, and N is nitrogens.\n\nFor the product with the formula **C10H20**:\nIHD = (2 * 10 + 2 - 20) / 2\nIHD = (20 + 2 - 20) / 2\nIHD = 2 / 2\nIHD = 1\n\nAlternatively, the IHD can be determined from the structure of the product. The product is a substituted cyclohexane. It contains:\n*   One ring (contributes 1 to IHD).\n*   Zero double or triple bonds (contributes 0 to IHD).\nSo, the total IHD of the product is 1.\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the final product is 1.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\n*   **Step 1: Identify the starting material and its structure.**\n    The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's break down the name to draw the structure:\n    *   `cyclohex`: A six-membered carbon ring.\n    *   `-3-ene`: A double bond in the ring, starting at carbon 3 (between C3 and C4).\n    *   `carboxylic acid`: A -COOH group. By convention, this is at position C1.\n    *   `2-formyl`: A -CHO (aldehyde) group at position C2.\n    *   `5-vinyl`: A -CH=CH2 group at position C5.\n\n    The structure contains the following functional groups and features contributing to unsaturation:\n    1.  A six-membered ring.\n    2.  A carbon-carbon double bond within the ring (`-3-ene`).\n    3.  A carbon-carbon double bond in the vinyl group.\n    4.  A carbon-oxygen double bond in the formyl group (-CHO).\n    5.  A carbon-oxygen double bond in the carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the molecular formula of the starting material.**\n    We can count the atoms from the structure drawn based on the name:\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 in the ring + 1 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO + 2 in the vinyl group = 10 carbons.\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** Let's count them carefully.\n        *   C1 (with -COOH): 1 H\n        *   C2 (with -CHO): 1 H\n        *   C3 (double bond): 1 H\n        *   C4 (double bond): 1 H\n        *   C5 (with vinyl): 1 H\n        *   C6 (saturated): 2 H\n        *   In -COOH: 1 H\n        *   In -CHO: 1 H\n        *   In -CH=CH2: 3 H\n        *   Total H = 1+1+1+1+1+2+1+1+3 = 12 hydrogens.\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO = 3 oxygens.\n    *   The molecular formula of the starting material is **C10H12O3**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify the reagent and its function.**\n    The reagent is red phosphorus and excess of hydroiodic acid (Red P/HI). This is one of the most powerful reducing agents in organic chemistry. Its function is to completely reduce most oxygen-containing functional groups and multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated alkanes.\n    *   Carboxylic acid (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   Aldehyde (-CHO) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   Carbon-carbon double bonds (-C=C-) are reduced to single bonds (-C-C-).\n    *   It essentially removes all heteroatoms (like oxygen) and all pi bonds, leaving behind a saturated hydrocarbon skeleton.\n\n*   **Step 4: Predict the structure and molecular formula of the product.**\n    The reaction will perform the following transformations on the starting material:\n    1.  The cyclohexane ring structure is preserved.\n    2.  The -COOH group at C1 is reduced to a -CH3 group.\n    3.  The -CHO group at C2 is reduced to a -CH3 group.\n    4.  The double bond in the ring (at C3=C4) is reduced to a single bond.\n    5.  The vinyl group (-CH=CH2) at C5 is reduced to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n\n    The final product is a substituted cyclohexane. The carbon skeleton is maintained, so the product will have 10 carbon atoms. Since all functional groups and double bonds are reduced, the product is a saturated monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane). The specific product would be 4-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane.\n\n    A saturated monocyclic alkane has the general formula **CnH2n**.\n    Since our product has 10 carbon atoms (C=10), its molecular formula will be **C10H(2*10) = C10H20**.\n\n*   **Step 5: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product.**\n    The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (also known as the degree of unsaturation) can be calculated using the molecular formula. The formula is:\n    IHD = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\n    Where C = number of carbons, H = number of hydrogens, X = number of halogens, N = number of nitrogens.\n\n    For the product C10H20:\n    *   C = 10\n    *   H = 20\n    *   X = 0\n    *   N = 0\n\n    IHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2)\n    IHD = 11 - 10\n    IHD = 1\n\n    Alternatively, the IHD can be determined by inspecting the structure of the product. The IHD counts the number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n    *   Product: 4-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane.\n    *   Number of rings = 1\n    *   Number of pi bonds (double or triple bonds) = 0\n    *   Total IHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\n    Both methods yield the same result. The index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane. This molecule contains one ring and no double or triple bonds.\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) is calculated as the sum of the number of rings and the number of pi bonds.\nIHD = (number of rings) + (number of pi bonds)\nFor the final product:\n- Number of rings = 1\n- Number of pi bonds = 0\nTherefore, IHD = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nThe calculation from the molecular formula C₁₀H₂₀ also gives:\nIHD = C - H/2 + 1 = 10 - 20/2 + 1 = 10 - 10 + 1 = 1.\n\nThe correct answer is 1. This corresponds to option A.\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThe user wants to find the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product formed from a specific reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reactant Structure**\nThe starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Core Structure:** A six-membered ring (cyclohex).\n*   **Unsaturation:**\n    *   One C=C double bond within the ring (\"-3-ene\"). This contributes 1 to the IHD.\n    *   The ring itself contributes 1 to the IHD.\n    *   One vinyl group (-CH=CH₂). This contains a C=C double bond, contributing 1 to the IHD.\n*   **Oxygen-containing groups:**\n    *   One formyl group (-CHO). This contains a C=O double bond, contributing 1 to the IHD.\n    *   One carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This contains a C=O double bond, contributing 1 to the IHD.\n\nThe total IHD of the starting material is 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C in ring) + 1 (C=C in vinyl) + 1 (C=O in formyl) + 1 (C=O in carboxylic acid) = 5.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction**\nThe reagent is red phosphorus and excess hydriodic acid (Red P/HI). This is a very strong reducing agent. It performs the following reductions:\n*   Reduces all carbon-oxygen double bonds (in aldehydes, ketones, and carboxylic acids) to CH₂ or CH₃ groups.\n*   Reduces all carbon-carbon double and triple bonds to single bonds.\n*   It effectively removes all oxygen atoms and all pi bonds from the molecule, leaving behind a saturated hydrocarbon with the original carbon skeleton.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Product Structure and Calculate its IHD**\nThe reaction will transform the starting material into a fully saturated hydrocarbon.\n*   The `cyclohexene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring.\n*   The `formyl` group is reduced to a `methyl` group.\n*   The `carboxylic acid` group is reduced to a `methyl` group.\n*   The `vinyl` group is reduced to an `ethyl` group.\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane. Let's calculate its IHD:\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency is the sum of the number of rings and pi bonds in the molecule.\n*   **Rings:** The product still contains the six-membered cyclohexane ring. So, the number of rings = 1.\n*   **Pi Bonds:** All double bonds (both C=C and C=O) have been reduced to single bonds. So, the number of pi bonds = 0.\n\nIHD of the product = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nThe correct answer is 1, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nAn explanation has already been generated.\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, for the product is calculated.\n\n1.  **Initial Reactant:** 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n2.  **Reaction:** The reaction with red phosphorus and excess HI is a complete reduction. This reaction reduces all multiple bonds (C=C, C=O) to single bonds and removes all oxygen-containing functional groups, converting them to their corresponding alkane parts.\n3.  **Product:**\n    *   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a saturated `cyclohexane` ring.\n    *   The `2-formyl` group (-CHO) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   The `5-vinyl` group (-CH=CH₂) is reduced to an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   The `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   The final product is 1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane.\n4.  **IHD of the Product:** The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency is calculated by the formula: IHD = (number of rings) + (number of pi bonds).\n    *   The product molecule, 1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane, has one ring (the cyclohexane ring).\n    *   It has zero pi bonds as all double bonds have been saturated.\n    *   Therefore, IHD = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nThe IHD of the final product is 1.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, is a calculation that determines the total number of rings and pi bonds within a molecule. The formula for IHD is:\nIHD = C - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 + 1\nwhere C, H, X, and N are the number of carbon, hydrogen, halogen, and nitrogen atoms, respectively. Oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation.\n\n**1. Identify the Reactant and Reagents:**\n*   **Reactant:** 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus and excess hydriodic acid (Red P / HI).\n\n**2. Determine the Molecular Formula of the Reactant:**\n*   The parent structure is `cyclohex-3-ene`: a 6-carbon ring with one double bond.\n*   Substituents are:\n    *   `carboxylic acid` (-COOH): adds 1 C, 1 H, and 2 O.\n    *   `formyl` group (-CHO): adds 1 C, 1 H, and 1 O.\n    *   `vinyl` group (-CH=CH₂): adds 2 C and 3 H.\n*   Let's count the atoms:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (in the ring) + 1 (in -COOH) + 1 (in -CHO) + 2 (in -CH=CH₂) = 10 carbons.\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (in -COOH) + 1 (in -CHO) = 3 oxygens.\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** A saturated 6-membered ring would have 12 hydrogens (C₆H₁₂). The double bond in the ring removes 2 H. Attaching the four substituents removes 4 H. So, H on the ring is 12 - 2 - 4 = 6. The hydrogens from the substituents are 1 (in -COOH), 1 (in -CHO), and 3 (in the vinyl group). Total H = 6 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 11. Let's re-verify H count by drawing the structure.\n        *   C1(COOH), C2(CHO), C3=C4, C5(Vinyl), C6.\n        *   H at C1=1, H at C2=1, H at C3=1, H at C4=1, H at C5=1, H at C6=2. Ring H = 7.\n        *   H in COOH = 1. H in CHO = 1. H in Vinyl(-CH=CH₂) = 3.\n        *   Total H = 7 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12.\n    *   The molecular formula of the reactant is **C₁₀H₁₂O₃**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Reaction:**\nThe combination of red phosphorus and excess HI is a very strong reducing agent. It will:\n*   Reduce aldehydes and carboxylic acids completely to alkane groups. (-CHO → -CH₃; -COOH → -CH₃).\n*   Reduce all carbon-carbon double bonds to single bonds (C=C → C-C).\n*   Remove all oxygen atoms from the molecule.\n*   The ring structure remains intact.\n\n**4. Determine the Product's Structure and Molecular Formula:**\n*   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring is hydrogenated to a `cyclohexane` ring.\n*   The `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The `formyl` group (-CHO) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The `vinyl` group (-CH=CH₂) is hydrogenated to an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n*   The carbon skeleton of C₁₀ remains the same.\n*   The resulting product is a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon (a substituted cyclohexane). The general formula for a cycloalkane is CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   Since there are 10 carbon atoms (n=10), the molecular formula of the product is **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\n**5. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product:**\n*   Using the molecular formula C₁₀H₂₀:\n    IHD = C - H/2 + 1 = 10 - (20/2) + 1 = 10 - 10 + 1 = 1.\n\n*   Alternatively, from the product's structure: The product is a cyclohexane ring with substituents. It contains **one ring** and **zero pi bonds**. Each ring contributes 1 to the IHD. Therefore, the IHD is 1.\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the final product is 1.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the structure of the reactant\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down its structure based on the name:\n*   **cyclohex-**: The molecule has a six-membered carbon ring.\n*   **-carboxylic acid**: There is a principal functional group, -COOH, attached to the ring. By IUPAC convention, its position is C1.\n*   **-3-ene**: There is a carbon-carbon double bond (a π-bond) in the ring between C3 and C4.\n*   **2-formyl**: An aldehyde group (-CHO) is attached to C2 of the ring. This group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (a π-bond).\n*   **5-vinyl**: A vinyl group (-CH=CH2) is attached to C5 of the ring. This group contains a carbon-carbon double bond (a π-bond).\nThe -COOH group itself also contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (a π-bond).\n\nSo, structurally, the reactant molecule contains:\n*   1 ring.\n*   4 π-bonds (one in the cyclohexene ring, one in the vinyl group, one in the formyl group, and one in the carboxylic acid group).\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the reactant is the sum of rings and π-bonds, which is 1 (ring) + 4 (π-bonds) = 5.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the chemical reaction and the transformation\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus (Red P) and excess HI**. This is a very strong reducing agent. It performs the following reductions:\n*   Reduces all carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n*   Reduces all carbonyl groups (C=O) in aldehydes and carboxylic acids completely to alkane parts (CH2 or CH3).\n*   Specifically, R-CHO is reduced to R-CH3.\n*   Specifically, R-COOH is reduced to R-CH3.\n\nIn essence, all π-bonds in the molecule are removed, and all oxygen atoms are eliminated. The carbon skeleton, including the ring, remains intact.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the structure of the product\nApplying the effects of the Red P/HI reduction to our reactant:\n*   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a saturated `cyclohexane` ring. The π-bond in the ring is gone.\n*   The `2-formyl` group (-CHO) becomes a methyl group (-CH3). The C=O π-bond is gone.\n*   The `5-vinyl` group (-CH=CH2) becomes an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The C=C π-bond is gone.\n*   The `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) becomes a methyl group (-CH3). The C=O π-bond is gone.\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane molecule. All functional groups containing π-bonds have been fully saturated. The only feature contributing to the index of hydrogen deficiency is the ring structure itself.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency is given by the formula:\nIHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π-bonds)\n\nFor the product molecule:\n*   Number of rings = 1 (the cyclohexane ring is preserved).\n*   Number of π-bonds = 0 (all double bonds were reduced).\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the product is:\nIHD = 1 + 0 = 1\n\nAlternatively, we can determine the molecular formula of the product.\n*   Reactant C atoms: 6 (ring) + 1 (COOH) + 1 (CHO) + 2 (vinyl) = 10 carbons.\n*   The reaction does not change the number of carbon atoms. So, the product has 10 carbons.\n*   The product is a substituted cyclohexane, which is a saturated monocyclic alkane. The general formula for such compounds is CnH2n.\n*   With n=10, the product's molecular formula is C10H20.\n*   Using the IHD formula for a molecular formula (C_c H_h O_o N_n X_x):\n    IHD = c - h/2 + n/2 + 1\n    IHD = 10 - 20/2 + 0/2 + 1 = 10 - 10 + 1 = 1.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
