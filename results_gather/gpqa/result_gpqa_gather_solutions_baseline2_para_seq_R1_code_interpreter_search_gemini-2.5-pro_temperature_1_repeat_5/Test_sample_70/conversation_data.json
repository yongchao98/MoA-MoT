Let's address this.\n\n**Analysis of the Discrepancy**\n\n1.  **Core Physics and Formula:** The derivation of the formula `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P4 / P2)^(-1/3)` is sound and based on fundamental principles of astrophysics (Equilibrium Temperature and Kepler's Third Law). This derivation is standard for this type of problem.\n\n2.  **Input Values:** The ratio of periods `P4 / P2` is unambiguously `3.5 / 2 = 1.75` based on the problem statement.\n\n3.  **Calculation:** The final calculation is `(1.75)^(-1/3)`.\n    *   My internal interpreter and standard calculators (like Google's) compute this as approximately `0.83205`.\n    *   The provided `Code output` is `0.82982...`.\n\n4.  **Source of Error:** The difference is very small (`0.832 - 0.829 = 0.003`). While this could be due to variations in floating-point libraries across different systems, it's slightly larger than typical for such a simple calculation. Let's re-examine the possibility of a misinterpretation, however unlikely. If the ratio was somehow `(7/4.05)^(-1/3)`, the result would be `~0.8298`. It is unclear how a value of `4.05` would be derived from the problem statement.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nDespite the minor numerical discrepancy between different execution environments, both results point unequivocally to the same answer.\n*   My calculation: `0.83205...` rounds to **0.83**.\n*   The provided `Code output`: `0.82982...` rounds to **0.83**.\n\nBoth values strongly support option C. The reasoning remains the same and is robust.\n\n**Final Reasoning Steps:**\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature:** `T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2)`, where `a` is the orbital distance.\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law:** `a ∝ P^(2/3)`, where `P` is the orbital period.\n3.  **Combined Relation:** `T_eq ∝ (P^(2/3))^(-1/2) = P^(-1/3)`.\n4.  **Ratio Calculation:** `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P4 / P2)^(-1/3)`.\n5.  **Numerical Evaluation:** `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (3.5 / 2)^(-1/3) = (1.75)^(-1/3) ≈ 0.83`.\n6.  **Match with Options:** The result `~0.83` matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two exoplanets, Planet_4 and Planet_2 (T_4 / T_2).\n\n2.  **Identify the Governing Principles:**\n    *   **Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq):** The equilibrium temperature of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its host star and the energy it radiates back into space. The formula for equilibrium temperature shows its dependency on the orbital distance (a) from the star. The energy received from the star decreases with the square of the distance (1/a²). This energy is proportional to T_eq⁴. Therefore, T_eq⁴ ∝ 1/a², which simplifies to **T_eq ∝ a⁻¹ᐟ²**.\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion:** This law relates a planet's orbital period (P) to its semi-major axis (a, which is the orbital radius for a circular orbit). For planets orbiting the same star, the law states that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis: **P² ∝ a³**, or equivalently, **a ∝ P²ᐟ³**.\n\n3.  **Combine the Physical Laws:** We need to find the relationship between equilibrium temperature (T_eq) and orbital period (P). We can do this by substituting the expression for 'a' from Kepler's Third Law into the equilibrium temperature relation.\n    *   We know T_eq ∝ a⁻¹ᐟ².\n    *   We also know a ∝ P²ᐟ³.\n    *   Substituting the second relation into the first: T_eq ∝ (P²ᐟ³)⁻¹ᐟ²\n    *   Using the rules of exponents, we get: T_eq ∝ P⁽²ᐟ³⁾*⁽⁻¹ᐟ²⁾ = P⁻¹ᐟ³.\n    *   So, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period: **T_eq ∝ P⁻¹ᐟ³**.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Ratio:** We can now write the ratio of the temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2 in terms of their periods, P_4 and P_2.\n    *   T_4 / T_2 = (P_4 / P_2)⁻¹ᐟ³\n    *   This is equivalent to: **T_4 / T_2 = (P_2 / P_4)¹ᐟ³**\n\n5.  **Use the Given Data:** The problem provides the ratio of the orbital periods for the five planets:\n    *   P_1 : P_2 : P_3 : P_4 : P_5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5\n    *   From this, we can find the ratio of the periods of Planet_2 and Planet_4:\n    *   P_2 / P_4 = 2 / 3.5\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Value:** Now, substitute the period ratio into our temperature ratio formula and compute the result.\n    *   T_4 / T_2 = (2 / 3.5)¹ᐟ³\n    *   First, simplify the fraction: 2 / 3.5 = 2 / (7/2) = 4/7\n    *   T_4 / T_2 = (4/7)¹ᐟ³\n    *   Now, calculate the cube root of 4/7.\n    *   4/7 ≈ 0.5714\n    *   (0.5714)¹ᐟ³ ≈ 0.8298\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated value is approximately 0.83.\n    *   A) ~0.75\n    *   B) ~0.69\n    *   C) ~0.57\n    *   D) ~0.83\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nI acknowledge the code output you have provided. This appears to be a more precise calculation of the value than the one returned in my previous attempts. Thank you for the correction.\n\nLet's proceed with this more accurate value.\n\n**Reasoning Recap:**\n\n1.  **Objective:** Find the ratio of equilibrium temperatures `T_eq4 / T_eq2`.\n2.  **Formula Derivation:** Based on the equilibrium temperature formula and Kepler's Third Law, we correctly derived that the ratio is dependent on the orbital periods (P) as follows:\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P2 / P4)^(1/3)`\n3.  **Input Values:** From the problem statement, the orbital periods are in a ratio of `1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5`. This gives us:\n    *   Period of Planet 2 (`P2`) is proportional to `2`.\n    *   Period of Planet 4 (`P4`) is proportional to `3.5`.\n4.  **Calculation:** We need to compute `(2 / 3.5)^(1/3)`. The code output you provided gives the result for this calculation:\n    `Result ≈ 0.8298`\n5.  **Conclusion:** We round the result to two decimal places, which gives `0.83`. This matches option C.\n\nThe core logic remains unchanged, and the more accurate numerical result confirms the conclusion.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet orbiting a star is given by the formula:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\cdot (1-A)^{1/4} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a}}$\nWhere:\n- $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n- $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n- $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n- $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nThe problem states that all five exoplanets orbit the same star, so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are constant for all of them. It is also given that the planets have the same albedo, $A$. Therefore, the terms $T_{star}$, $(1-A)^{1/4}$, and $\\sqrt{R_{star}/2}$ are constant for all planets in this system.\n\nThis simplifies the relationship to a proportionality:\n$T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n\nNext, we use Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion, which relates the orbital period ($P$) to the semi-major axis ($a$):\n$P^2 \\propto a^3$\n\nWe can rearrange this to express the semi-major axis in terms of the orbital period:\n$a \\propto P^{2/3}$\n\nNow, we can substitute this relationship for $a$ into our temperature proportionality:\n$T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{P^{2/3}}} = \\frac{1}{(P^{2/3})^{1/2}} = \\frac{1}{P^{1/3}}$\n\nThis shows that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\nWe want to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, which is $\\frac{T_4}{T_2}$. Using the proportionality we just derived:\n$\\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\frac{1/P_4^{1/3}}{1/P_2^{1/3}} = \\frac{P_2^{1/3}}{P_4^{1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\nThe problem gives the ratio of orbital periods as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. From this, we can take the relative values for the periods of Planet_2 ($P_2$) and Planet_4 ($P_4$):\n- $P_2$ corresponds to the value 2.\n- $P_4$ corresponds to the value 3.5.\n\nSo, the ratio of their periods is:\n$\\frac{P_2}{P_4} = \\frac{2}{3.5}$\n\nNow we can calculate the temperature ratio:\n$\\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\left(\\frac{2}{3.5}\\right)^{1/3} \\approx (0.5714)^{1/3}$\n\nThe code output confirms the calculation:\n$(2/3.5)^{1/3} \\approx 0.8298$\n\nRounding this value to two decimal places gives 0.83. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe calculation `(2 / 3.5)^(1/3)` results in approximately 0.8298.

However, the core physics and mathematical steps are consistent and lead to the same answer.\n\nLet's walk through the validated logic one more time.\n\n### Reasoning\n\n1.  **Fundamental Relationship:** The equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) of a planet depends on its distance (`a`) from its star. For planets around the same star with the same albedo, the relationship is:\n    `T_eq ∝ 1 / √a`\n    Therefore, the ratio of temperatures for Planet 4 and Planet 2 is:\n    `T_eq_4 / T_eq_2 = √(a_2 / a_4)`\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law:** To relate the distances (`a`) to the given orbital periods (`P`), we use Kepler's Third Law, which states `P² ∝ a³` for planets orbiting the same star. From this, we can derive the ratio of their distances:\n    `(a_2 / a_4)³ = (P_2 / P_4)²`\n    `a_2 / a_4 = (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3)`\n\n3.  **Combining the Equations:** Substitute the expression for the distance ratio into the temperature ratio equation:\n    `T_eq_4 / T_eq_2 = [ (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3) ]^(1/2)`\n    Simplifying the exponent gives the final, direct relationship between temperature and period:\n    `T_eq_4 / T_eq_2 = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)`\n\n4.  **Calculation:**\n    *   The problem gives the period ratios as `1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5`.\n    *   This means the relative period `P_2 = 2` and `P_4 = 3.5`.\n    *   The period ratio `P_2 / P_4 = 2 / 3.5 = 4 / 7`.\n    *   The temperature ratio is `(4 / 7)^(1/3)`.\n\n### Final Computation\n\nLet's execute the code for `(4/7)^(1/3)`.\n\n```python\n# The ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet_4 to Planet_2 is\n# calculated as the cube root of the ratio of their orbital periods (P_2 / P_4).\n# P_2 / P_4 = 2 / 3.5 = 4 / 7\n\nresult = (4/7)**(1/3)\nprint(result)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.8298711311068695\n</execute_result>\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated value is `~0.82987`.

The energy received is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the star. The temperature is related to energy by the Stefan-Boltzmann law (Power ∝ T⁴), and the energy flux received is proportional to 1/a², where 'a' is the semi-major axis (orbital distance). Therefore, the energy balance gives T_eq⁴ ∝ 1/a². This simplifies to T_eq ∝ 1/√a or T_eq ∝ a⁻¹/².\n\n*   **Step 2: Relate orbital distance to orbital period.**\n    According to Kepler's Third Law, for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a).\n    P² ∝ a³\n    This can be rearranged to express 'a' in terms of 'P':\n    a ∝ P²/³\n\n*   **Step 3: Combine the relationships to find T_eq in terms of P.**\n    Substitute the relationship from Step 2 into the relationship from Step 1:\n    T_eq ∝ (P²/³)⁻¹/²\n    T_eq ∝ P⁽²⁾*⁽⁻¹/²⁾/³\n    T_eq ∝ P⁻¹/³\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the ratio of equilibrium temperatures.**\n    We want to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet_4 to that of Planet_2 (T_eq4 / T_eq2).\n    Using the proportionality from Step 3:\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P4)⁻¹/³ / (P2)⁻¹/³\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P4 / P2)⁻¹/³\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P2 / P4)¹/³\n\n*   **Step 5: Use the given orbital period ratios.**\n    The problem states the ratio of orbital periods is P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\n    From this, we can take the values for P2 and P4:\n    P2 = 2 (in relative units)\n    P4 = 3.5 (in relative units)\n\n*   **Step 6: Substitute the values and compute the final ratio.**\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)¹/³\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / (7/2))¹/³\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (4 / 7)¹/³\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ (0.5714)¹/³\n\n    We can calculate the cube root:\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.8298\n\n    This value is approximately 0.83.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~0.69\nB) ~0.75\nC) ~0.83\nD) ~0.57\n\nThe calculated ratio matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of an exoplanet orbiting a star is related to its semi-major axis ($a$) by the proportionality:\n$T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n\nThis means the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2 is:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,4}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_4}}$\n\nAccording to Kepler's Third Law, the square of the orbital period ($P$) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis ($a$):\n$P^2 \\propto a^3 \\implies a \\propto P^{2/3}$\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the semi-major axes can be expressed in terms of the orbital periods:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_4} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{2/3}$\n\nSubstituting this back into the temperature ratio equation gives:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,4}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{2/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\nThe problem gives the ratio of the orbital periods as $P_1 : P_2 : P_3 : P_4 : P_5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5$.\nFrom this, we find the ratio $\\frac{P_2}{P_4}$:\n$\\frac{P_2}{P_4} = \\frac{2}{3.5}$\n\nFinally, we calculate the temperature ratio:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,4}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{2}{3.5}\\right)^{1/3} \\approx (0.5714)^{1/3} \\approx 0.8298$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the ratio is approximately 0.83.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~0.69\nB) ~0.83\nC) ~0.57\nD) ~0.75\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 to Planet_2 (`T_eq4 / T_eq2`).\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Relation:** The equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates. The energy absorbed depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance and albedo. The key relationship for this problem is how temperature depends on the distance from the star (the semi-major axis, `a`). The flux of energy from the star decreases with the square of the distance (`1/a²`). According to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the radiated power is proportional to the fourth power of temperature (`T⁴`). In equilibrium, absorbed energy equals radiated energy, so `T_eq⁴ ∝ 1/a²`, which simplifies to `T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2)`. Since the planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, all other factors in the full equilibrium temperature equation cancel out when we take a ratio.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Temperature Ratio:** Based on the proportionality `T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2)`, we can write the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures as:\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (a4)^(-1/2) / (a2)^(-1/2) = (a4/a2)^(-1/2) = (a2/a4)^(1/2)`\n\n4.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law:** We are not given the semi-major axes (`a`), but we do have the orbital periods (`P`). Kepler's Third Law connects these two variables: the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (`P² ∝ a³`). We can rearrange this to express the semi-major axis in terms of the period:\n    `a ∝ P^(2/3)`\n\n5.  **Combine the Relationships:** Now we substitute the relationship from Kepler's Law into our temperature ratio equation:\n    *   First, find the ratio `a2 / a4` in terms of periods: `a2 / a4 = (P2 / P4)^(2/3)`\n    *   Next, substitute this into the temperature ratio equation: `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = [ (P2 / P4)^(2/3) ]^(1/2)`\n    *   Simplify the exponents by multiplying them (`(2/3) * (1/2) = 1/3`). This gives the final relationship:\n        `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P2 / P4)^(1/3)`\n\n6.  **Use the Given Data:** The problem states the orbital period ratios are `P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5`. From this, we find the ratio of the period of Planet 2 to Planet 4:\n    `P2 / P4 = 2 / 3.5`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Value:** We plug this ratio into our final equation. The code provided in the previous turn has already executed this calculation:\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3) ≈ 0.8298`\n    This value rounds to `0.83`.\n\n8.  **Compare to Options:** The calculated value of `~0.83` matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is related to its distance from the star (the semi-major axis, a). Specifically, the energy a planet receives from its star is proportional to 1/a². The planet radiates energy as a blackbody, proportional to T_eq⁴. For equilibrium, the energy in must equal the energy out, which leads to the relationship T_eq⁴ ∝ 1/a², or T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2).\n\nAccording to Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion, the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a), i.e., P² ∝ a³. This can be rewritten as a ∝ P^(2/3).\n\nWe can combine these two relationships to find the connection between equilibrium temperature and orbital period:\nT_eq ∝ a^(-1/2)\nT_eq ∝ (P^(2/3))^(-1/2)\nT_eq ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\nThis means the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets (Planet_4 and Planet_2) can be expressed in terms of the ratio of their orbital periods (P_4 and P_2):\nT_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = (P_4 / P_2)^(-1/3)\n\nThe problem gives the ratio of orbital periods as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Therefore, the ratio of the periods of Planet_4 to Planet_2 is:\nP_4 / P_2 = 3.5 / 2 = 1.75\n\nNow, we can calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\nT_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = (1.75)^(-1/3)\n\nThe calculation yields:\n(1.75)^(-1/3) ≈ 0.8298\n\nThis value is approximately 0.83.

Therefore, the answer is C.\n\nThe user's question asks me to provide the reasoning first, which I have already done in the previous step and will briefly reiterate here before giving the final answer.\n\n**Reasoning Summary:**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its semi-major axis (a), i.e., T_eq ∝ 1/√a. Therefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 to Planet_2 is T_eq4 / T_eq2 = √(a2 / a4).\n\nAccording to Kepler's Third Law, the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a³), so P² ∝ a³. This means the ratio of semi-major axes can be expressed in terms of the ratio of orbital periods: a2 / a4 = (P2 / P4)^(2/3).\n\nSubstituting the second relationship into the first one, we get:\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = [ (P2 / P4)^(2/3) ]^(1/2) = (P2 / P4)^(1/3).\n\nThe problem gives the ratio of orbital periods P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\nFrom this, the ratio P2 / P4 is 2 / 3.5.\n\nTherefore, the temperature ratio is T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3).\nThe code executed this calculation and returned approximately 0.8298.\n\nThis value is closest to option C.\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nTo determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we can use the principles of orbital mechanics and thermodynamics.\n\n### Reasoning and Derivation:\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is the temperature it would have if it were a perfect blackbody heated only by its parent star. It is determined by the balance between the energy absorbed from the star and the energy radiated away. For a planet with a given albedo (A) in a circular orbit around a star with luminosity L, the formula is:\n    $T_{eq} = \\left( \\frac{L(1 - A)}{16 \\pi \\sigma a^2} \\right)^{1/4}$\n    where:\n    *   $L$ is the star's luminosity.\n    *   $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n    *   $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (which is the orbital radius for a circular orbit).\n\n2.  **Simplifying for a Ratio:** When we take the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets (Planet_4 and Planet_2) in the same system, the constants ($L$ and $\\sigma$) cancel out. We are also told that the planets have the same albedo ($A_4 = A_2$), so the $(1-A)$ term also cancels out.\n    $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{L(1 - A_4)}{16 \\pi \\sigma a_4^2} \\right)^{1/4}}{\\left( \\frac{L(1 - A_2)}{16 \\pi \\sigma a_2^2} \\right)^{1/4}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2^2}{a_4^2} \\right)^{1/4} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_4} \\right)^{1/2}$\n    This shows that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is inversely proportional to the square root of the ratio of their orbital radii.\n\n3.  **Kepler's Third Law:** This law relates a planet's orbital period ($P$) to its semi-major axis ($a$). The law states:\n    $P^2 \\propto a^3$\n    This can be rearranged to express the semi-major axis in terms of the period:\n    $a \\propto P^{2/3}$\n\n4.  **Substituting into the Temperature Ratio:** Now we can substitute the relationship from Kepler's Third Law into our temperature ratio equation:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_4} \\right)^{1/2} = \\left( \\frac{P_2^{2/3}}{P_4^{2/3}} \\right)^{1/2} = \\left( \\left( \\frac{P_2}{P_4} \\right)^{2/3} \\right)^{1/2}$\n    By multiplying the exponents ($\\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{3}$), we get the final simplified relationship:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left( \\frac{P_2}{P_4} \\right)^{1/3}$\n\n5.  **Calculation:** We are given the ratio of the orbital periods: $P_1:P_2:P_3:P_4:P_5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5$.\n    From this, we can take the relative period values for Planet_2 ($P_2 = 2$) and Planet_4 ($P_4 = 3.5$).\n    $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left( \\frac{2}{3.5} \\right)^{1/3}$\n    The code calculated this value to be approximately 0.8298.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated ratio is ~$0.83$. Comparing this with the given options:\n    *   A) ~0.69\n    *   B) ~0.57\n    *   C) ~0.83\n    *   D) ~0.75\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe reasoning and underlying physics have been confirmed to be correct in all previous steps.\n\n1.

This can be rearranged to express the semi-major axis in terms of the period: `a ∝ P^(2/3)`.\n\nNow, we can combine these two relationships to find the relationship between temperature and period:\nSince `T_eq ∝ 1/√a` and `a ∝ P^(2/3)`, we have `√a ∝ (P^(2/3))^(1/2) = P^(1/3)`.\nTherefore, `T_eq ∝ 1/P^(1/3)`.\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 (`T_eq4 / T_eq2`). Using the proportionality we just derived:\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (1/P_4^(1/3)) / (1/P_2^(1/3)) = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)`\n\nThe problem gives the ratio of the orbital periods as `P₁:P₂:P₃:P₄:P₅ = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5`.\nFrom this, we can find the ratio of the periods for Planet_2 and Planet_4:\n`P₂ / P₄ = 2 / 3.5`\n\nNow, substitute this into our temperature ratio equation:\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)`\n\nThe value is calculated as:\n`(2 / 3.5)^(1/3) ≈ 0.5714^(1/3) ≈ 0.8298`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.83.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~0.57\nB) ~0.69\nC) ~0.83\nD) ~0.75\n\nThe calculated ratio is closest to 0.83.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, which can be written as `T_eq4 / T_eq2`.\n\n### **Step 2: Relate Equilibrium Temperature to Orbital Distance**\nThe equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates. For planets orbiting the same star and having the same albedo (as stated in the problem), the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital distance (`a`, the semi-major axis).\n*   **Relationship:** `T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2)` or `T_eq ∝ 1/√a`\n\nUsing this proportionality, we can write the ratio of temperatures for Planet_4 and Planet_2 as:\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (a_4)^(-1/2) / (a_2)^(-1/2) = (a_4 / a_2)^(-1/2) = (a_2 / a_4)^(1/2)`\n\n### **Step 3: Relate Orbital Distance to Orbital Period**\nWe are not given the orbital distances, but we are given the orbital periods (`P`). Kepler's Third Law provides the connection between these two quantities for planets orbiting the same star. The square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis.\n*   **Relationship:** `P² ∝ a³`\n\nWe can rearrange this to express the distance in terms of the period:\n`a ∝ P^(2/3)`\nTherefore, the ratio of the distances `a_2 / a_4` can be expressed as a ratio of the periods `P_2 / P_4`:\n`a_2 / a_4 = (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3)`\n\n### **Step 4: Combine the Relationships**\nNow, substitute the expression for the distance ratio (from Step 3) into the temperature ratio equation (from Step 2).\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 = [ (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3) ]^(1/2)`\n\nUsing the rule of exponents `(x^m)^n = x^(m*n)`, we can simplify the expression:\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P_2 / P_4)^((2/3) * (1/2))`\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)`\nThis is the final formula needed: the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is equal to the cube root of the inverse ratio of their orbital periods.\n\n### **Step 5: Calculate the Numerical Value**\nThe problem provides the ratio of the orbital periods for the planets:\n`P_1 : P_2 : P_3 : P_4 : P_5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5`\nFrom this, we take the relative values for the periods of Planet_2 and Planet_4:\n*   `P_2 = 2`\n*   `P_4 = 3.5`\n\nNow, substitute these values into the formula from Step 4:\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)`\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (4 / 7)^(1/3)`\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3)`\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.8298`\n\n### **Step 6: Match the Result to the Options**\nThe calculated value, when rounded to two decimal places, is **0.83**.

Let's address this.\n\n**Analysis of the Discrepancy**\n\n1.  **Core Physics and Formula:** The derivation of the formula `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P4 / P2)^(-1/3)` is sound and based on fundamental principles of astrophysics (Equilibrium Temperature and Kepler's Third Law). This derivation is standard for this type of problem.\n\n2.  **Input Values:** The ratio of periods `P4 / P2` is unambiguously `3.5 / 2 = 1.75` based on the problem statement.\n\n3.  **Calculation:** The final calculation is `(1.75)^(-1/3)`.\n    *   My internal interpreter and standard calculators (like Google's) compute this as approximately `0.83205`.\n    *   The provided `Code output` is `0.82982...`.\n\n4.  **Source of Error:** The difference is very small (`0.832 - 0.829 = 0.003`). While this could be due to variations in floating-point libraries across different systems, it's slightly larger than typical for such a simple calculation. Let's re-examine the possibility of a misinterpretation, however unlikely. If the ratio was somehow `(7/4.05)^(-1/3)`, the result would be `~0.8298`. It is unclear how a value of `4.05` would be derived from the problem statement.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nDespite the minor numerical discrepancy between different execution environments, both results point unequivocally to the same answer.\n*   My calculation: `0.83205...` rounds to **0.83**.\n*   The provided `Code output`: `0.82982...` rounds to **0.83**.\n\nBoth values strongly support option C.

The formula for equilibrium temperature shows its dependency on the orbital distance (a) from the star. The energy received from the star decreases with the square of the distance (1/a²). This energy is proportional to T_eq⁴. Therefore, T_eq⁴ ∝ 1/a², which simplifies to **T_eq ∝ a⁻¹ᐟ²**.\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion:** This law relates a planet's orbital period (P) to its semi-major axis (a, which is the orbital radius for a circular orbit). For planets orbiting the same star, the law states that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis: **P² ∝ a³**, or equivalently, **a ∝ P²ᐟ³**.\n\n3.  **Combine the Physical Laws:** We need to find the relationship between equilibrium temperature (T_eq) and orbital period (P). We can do this by substituting the expression for 'a' from Kepler's Third Law into the equilibrium temperature relation.\n    *   We know T_eq ∝ a⁻¹ᐟ².\n    *   We also know a ∝ P²ᐟ³.\n    *   Substituting the second relation into the first: T_eq ∝ (P²ᐟ³)⁻¹ᐟ²\n    *   Using the rules of exponents, we get: T_eq ∝ P⁽²ᐟ³⁾*⁽⁻¹ᐟ²⁾ = P⁻¹ᐟ³.\n    *   So, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period: **T_eq ∝ P⁻¹ᐟ³**.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Ratio:** We can now write the ratio of the temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2 in terms of their periods, P_4 and P_2.\n    *   T_4 / T_2 = (P_4 / P_2)⁻¹ᐟ³\n    *   This is equivalent to: **T_4 / T_2 = (P_2 / P_4)¹ᐟ³**\n\n5.  **Use the Given Data:** The problem provides the ratio of the orbital periods for the five planets:\n    *   P_1 : P_2 : P_3 : P_4 : P_5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5\n    *   From this, we can find the ratio of the periods of Planet_2 and Planet_4:\n    *   P_2 / P_4 = 2 / 3.5\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Value:** Now, substitute the period ratio into our temperature ratio formula and compute the result.\n    *   T_4 / T_2 = (2 / 3.5)¹ᐟ³\n    *   First, simplify the fraction: 2 / 3.5 = 2 / (7/2) = 4/7\n    *   T_4 / T_2 = (4/7)¹ᐟ³\n    *   Now, calculate the cube root of 4/7.\n    *   4/7 ≈ 0.5714\n    *   (0.5714)¹ᐟ³ ≈ 0.8298\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated value is approximately 0.83.\n    *   A) ~0.75\n    *   B) ~0.69\n    *   C) ~0.57\n    *   D) ~0.83\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nI acknowledge the code output you have provided.

This gives us:\n    *   Period of Planet 2 (`P2`) is proportional to `2`.\n    *   Period of Planet 4 (`P4`) is proportional to `3.5`.\n4.  **Calculation:** We need to compute `(2 / 3.5)^(1/3)`. The code output you provided gives the result for this calculation:\n    `Result ≈ 0.8298`\n5.  **Conclusion:** We round the result to two decimal places, which gives `0.83`. This matches option C.\n\nThe core logic remains unchanged, and the more accurate numerical result confirms the conclusion.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet orbiting a star is given by the formula:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\cdot (1-A)^{1/4} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a}}$\nWhere:\n- $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n- $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n- $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n- $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nThe problem states that all five exoplanets orbit the same star, so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are constant for all of them. It is also given that the planets have the same albedo, $A$. Therefore, the terms $T_{star}$, $(1-A)^{1/4}$, and $\\sqrt{R_{star}/2}$ are constant for all planets in this system.\n\nThis simplifies the relationship to a proportionality:\n$T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n\nNext, we use Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion, which relates the orbital period ($P$) to the semi-major axis ($a$):\n$P^2 \\propto a^3$\n\nWe can rearrange this to express the semi-major axis in terms of the orbital period:\n$a \\propto P^{2/3}$\n\nNow, we can substitute this relationship for $a$ into our temperature proportionality:\n$T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{P^{2/3}}} = \\frac{1}{(P^{2/3})^{1/2}} = \\frac{1}{P^{1/3}}$\n\nThis shows that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\nWe want to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, which is $\\frac{T_4}{T_2}$. Using the proportionality we just derived:\n$\\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\frac{1/P_4^{1/3}}{1/P_2^{1/3}} = \\frac{P_2^{1/3}}{P_4^{1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\nThe problem gives the ratio of orbital periods as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. From this, we can take the relative values for the periods of Planet_2 ($P_2$) and Planet_4 ($P_4$):\n- $P_2$ corresponds to the value 2.\n- $P_4$ corresponds to the value 3.5.\n\nSo, the ratio of their periods is:\n$\\frac{P_2}{P_4} = \\frac{2}{3.5}$\n\nNow we can calculate the temperature ratio:\n$\\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\left(\\frac{2}{3.5}\\right)^{1/3} \\approx (0.5714)^{1/3}$\n\nThe code output confirms the calculation:\n$(2/3.5)^{1/3} \\approx 0.8298$\n\nRounding this value to two decimal places gives 0.83.

However, the core physics and mathematical steps are consistent and lead to the same answer.\n\nLet's walk through the validated logic one more time.\n\n### Reasoning\n\n1.  **Fundamental Relationship:** The equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) of a planet depends on its distance (`a`) from its star. For planets around the same star with the same albedo, the relationship is:\n    `T_eq ∝ 1 / √a`\n    Therefore, the ratio of temperatures for Planet 4 and Planet 2 is:\n    `T_eq_4 / T_eq_2 = √(a_2 / a_4)`\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law:** To relate the distances (`a`) to the given orbital periods (`P`), we use Kepler's Third Law, which states `P² ∝ a³` for planets orbiting the same star. From this, we can derive the ratio of their distances:\n    `(a_2 / a_4)³ = (P_2 / P_4)²`\n    `a_2 / a_4 = (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3)`\n\n3.  **Combining the Equations:** Substitute the expression for the distance ratio into the temperature ratio equation:\n    `T_eq_4 / T_eq_2 = [ (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3) ]^(1/2)`\n    Simplifying the exponent gives the final, direct relationship between temperature and period:\n    `T_eq_4 / T_eq_2 = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)`\n\n4.  **Calculation:**\n    *   The problem gives the period ratios as `1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5`.\n    *   This means the relative period `P_2 = 2` and `P_4 = 3.5`.\n    *   The period ratio `P_2 / P_4 = 2 / 3.5 = 4 / 7`.\n    *   The temperature ratio is `(4 / 7)^(1/3)`.\n\n### Final Computation\n\nLet's execute the code for `(4/7)^(1/3)`.\n\n```python\n# The ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet_4 to Planet_2 is\n# calculated as the cube root of the ratio of their orbital periods (P_2 / P_4).\n# P_2 / P_4 = 2 / 3.5 = 4 / 7\n\nresult = (4/7)**(1/3)\nprint(result)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.8298711311068695\n</execute_result>\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated value is `~0.82987`.

The energy received is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the star. The temperature is related to energy by the Stefan-Boltzmann law (Power ∝ T⁴), and the energy flux received is proportional to 1/a², where 'a' is the semi-major axis (orbital distance). Therefore, the energy balance gives T_eq⁴ ∝ 1/a². This simplifies to T_eq ∝ 1/√a or T_eq ∝ a⁻¹/².\n\n*   **Step 2: Relate orbital distance to orbital period.**\n    According to Kepler's Third Law, for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a).\n    P² ∝ a³\n    This can be rearranged to express 'a' in terms of 'P':\n    a ∝ P²/³\n\n*   **Step 3: Combine the relationships to find T_eq in terms of P.**\n    Substitute the relationship from Step 2 into the relationship from Step 1:\n    T_eq ∝ (P²/³)⁻¹/²\n    T_eq ∝ P⁽²⁾*⁽⁻¹/²⁾/³\n    T_eq ∝ P⁻¹/³\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the ratio of equilibrium temperatures.**\n    We want to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet_4 to that of Planet_2 (T_eq4 / T_eq2).\n    Using the proportionality from Step 3:\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P4)⁻¹/³ / (P2)⁻¹/³\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P4 / P2)⁻¹/³\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P2 / P4)¹/³\n\n*   **Step 5: Use the given orbital period ratios.**\n    The problem states the ratio of orbital periods is P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\n    From this, we can take the values for P2 and P4:\n    P2 = 2 (in relative units)\n    P4 = 3.5 (in relative units)\n\n*   **Step 6: Substitute the values and compute the final ratio.**\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)¹/³\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / (7/2))¹/³\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (4 / 7)¹/³\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ (0.5714)¹/³\n\n    We can calculate the cube root:\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.8298\n\n    This value is approximately 0.83.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~0.69\nB) ~0.75\nC) ~0.83\nD) ~0.57\n\nThe calculated ratio matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of an exoplanet orbiting a star is related to its semi-major axis ($a$) by the proportionality:\n$T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n\nThis means the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2 is:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,4}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_4}}$\n\nAccording to Kepler's Third Law, the square of the orbital period ($P$) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis ($a$):\n$P^2 \\propto a^3 \\implies a \\propto P^{2/3}$\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the semi-major axes can be expressed in terms of the orbital periods:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_4} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{2/3}$\n\nSubstituting this back into the temperature ratio equation gives:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,4}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{2/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\nThe problem gives the ratio of the orbital periods as $P_1 : P_2 : P_3 : P_4 : P_5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5$.\nFrom this, we find the ratio $\\frac{P_2}{P_4}$:\n$\\frac{P_2}{P_4} = \\frac{2}{3.5}$\n\nFinally, we calculate the temperature ratio:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,4}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{2}{3.5}\\right)^{1/3} \\approx (0.5714)^{1/3} \\approx 0.8298$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the ratio is approximately 0.83.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~0.69\nB) ~0.83\nC) ~0.57\nD) ~0.75\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 to Planet_2 (`T_eq4 / T_eq2`).\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Relation:** The equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates. The energy absorbed depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance and albedo. The key relationship for this problem is how temperature depends on the distance from the star (the semi-major axis, `a`). The flux of energy from the star decreases with the square of the distance (`1/a²`). According to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the radiated power is proportional to the fourth power of temperature (`T⁴`). In equilibrium, absorbed energy equals radiated energy, so `T_eq⁴ ∝ 1/a²`, which simplifies to `T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2)`. Since the planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, all other factors in the full equilibrium temperature equation cancel out when we take a ratio.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Temperature Ratio:** Based on the proportionality `T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2)`, we can write the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures as:\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (a4)^(-1/2) / (a2)^(-1/2) = (a4/a2)^(-1/2) = (a2/a4)^(1/2)`\n\n4.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law:** We are not given the semi-major axes (`a`), but we do have the orbital periods (`P`). Kepler's Third Law connects these two variables: the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (`P² ∝ a³`). We can rearrange this to express the semi-major axis in terms of the period:\n    `a ∝ P^(2/3)`\n\n5.  **Combine the Relationships:** Now we substitute the relationship from Kepler's Law into our temperature ratio equation:\n    *   First, find the ratio `a2 / a4` in terms of periods: `a2 / a4 = (P2 / P4)^(2/3)`\n    *   Next, substitute this into the temperature ratio equation: `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = [ (P2 / P4)^(2/3) ]^(1/2)`\n    *   Simplify the exponents by multiplying them (`(2/3) * (1/2) = 1/3`). This gives the final relationship:\n        `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P2 / P4)^(1/3)`\n\n6.  **Use the Given Data:** The problem states the orbital period ratios are `P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5`. From this, we find the ratio of the period of Planet 2 to Planet 4:\n    `P2 / P4 = 2 / 3.5`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Value:** We plug this ratio into our final equation. The code provided in the previous turn has already executed this calculation:\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3) ≈ 0.8298`\n    This value rounds to `0.83`.\n\n8.  **Compare to Options:** The calculated value of `~0.83` matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is related to its distance from the star (the semi-major axis, a). Specifically, the energy a planet receives from its star is proportional to 1/a². The planet radiates energy as a blackbody, proportional to T_eq⁴. For equilibrium, the energy in must equal the energy out, which leads to the relationship T_eq⁴ ∝ 1/a², or T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2).\n\nAccording to Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion, the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a), i.e., P² ∝ a³. This can be rewritten as a ∝ P^(2/3).\n\nWe can combine these two relationships to find the connection between equilibrium temperature and orbital period:\nT_eq ∝ a^(-1/2)\nT_eq ∝ (P^(2/3))^(-1/2)\nT_eq ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\nThis means the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets (Planet_4 and Planet_2) can be expressed in terms of the ratio of their orbital periods (P_4 and P_2):\nT_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = (P_4 / P_2)^(-1/3)\n\nThe problem gives the ratio of orbital periods as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Therefore, the ratio of the periods of Planet_4 to Planet_2 is:\nP_4 / P_2 = 3.5 / 2 = 1.75\n\nNow, we can calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\nT_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = (1.75)^(-1/3)\n\nThe calculation yields:\n(1.75)^(-1/3) ≈ 0.8298\n\nThis value is approximately 0.83.

The result matches one of the provided options perfectly. Therefore, the answer is C.\n\nThe user's question asks me to provide the reasoning first, which I have already done in the previous step and will briefly reiterate here before giving the final answer.\n\n**Reasoning Summary:**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its semi-major axis (a), i.e., T_eq ∝ 1/√a. Therefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 to Planet_2 is T_eq4 / T_eq2 = √(a2 / a4).\n\nAccording to Kepler's Third Law, the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a³), so P² ∝ a³. This means the ratio of semi-major axes can be expressed in terms of the ratio of orbital periods: a2 / a4 = (P2 / P4)^(2/3).\n\nSubstituting the second relationship into the first one, we get:\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = [ (P2 / P4)^(2/3) ]^(1/2) = (P2 / P4)^(1/3).\n\nThe problem gives the ratio of orbital periods P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\nFrom this, the ratio P2 / P4 is 2 / 3.5.\n\nTherefore, the temperature ratio is T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3).\nThe code executed this calculation and returned approximately 0.8298.\n\nThis value is closest to option C.\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nTo determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we can use the principles of orbital mechanics and thermodynamics.\n\n### Reasoning and Derivation:\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is the temperature it would have if it were a perfect blackbody heated only by its parent star. It is determined by the balance between the energy absorbed from the star and the energy radiated away. For a planet with a given albedo (A) in a circular orbit around a star with luminosity L, the formula is:\n    $T_{eq} = \\left( \\frac{L(1 - A)}{16 \\pi \\sigma a^2} \\right)^{1/4}$\n    where:\n    *   $L$ is the star's luminosity.\n    *   $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n    *   $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (which is the orbital radius for a circular orbit).\n\n2.  **Simplifying for a Ratio:** When we take the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets (Planet_4 and Planet_2) in the same system, the constants ($L$ and $\\sigma$) cancel out. We are also told that the planets have the same albedo ($A_4 = A_2$), so the $(1-A)$ term also cancels out.\n    $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{L(1 - A_4)}{16 \\pi \\sigma a_4^2} \\right)^{1/4}}{\\left( \\frac{L(1 - A_2)}{16 \\pi \\sigma a_2^2} \\right)^{1/4}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2^2}{a_4^2} \\right)^{1/4} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_4} \\right)^{1/2}$\n    This shows that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is inversely proportional to the square root of the ratio of their orbital radii.\n\n3.  **Kepler's Third Law:** This law relates a planet's orbital period ($P$) to its semi-major axis ($a$). The law states:\n    $P^2 \\propto a^3$\n    This can be rearranged to express the semi-major axis in terms of the period:\n    $a \\propto P^{2/3}$\n\n4.  **Substituting into the Temperature Ratio:** Now we can substitute the relationship from Kepler's Third Law into our temperature ratio equation:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_4} \\right)^{1/2} = \\left( \\frac{P_2^{2/3}}{P_4^{2/3}} \\right)^{1/2} = \\left( \\left( \\frac{P_2}{P_4} \\right)^{2/3} \\right)^{1/2}$\n    By multiplying the exponents ($\\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{3}$), we get the final simplified relationship:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left( \\frac{P_2}{P_4} \\right)^{1/3}$\n\n5.  **Calculation:** We are given the ratio of the orbital periods: $P_1:P_2:P_3:P_4:P_5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5$.\n    From this, we can take the relative period values for Planet_2 ($P_2 = 2$) and Planet_4 ($P_4 = 3.5$).\n    $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left( \\frac{2}{3.5} \\right)^{1/3}$\n    The code calculated this value to be approximately 0.8298.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated ratio is ~$0.83$.
