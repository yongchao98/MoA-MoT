Deconstruct the Information Provided**\n\n*   **Structure:** A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This is a benzene ring with two groups attached (C6H4XY).\n*   **Molecular Formula:** The compound has 8 carbon atoms in total. Since the benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, the two substituents (X and Y) must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **FTIR Data:**\n    *   A peak for a carbonyl group (C=O) is present.\n    *   A peak for an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X) is present.\n\n**2. Deduce the Possible Chemical Structure**\n\n*   From the FTIR data, we know one substituent (let's say X) is a halogen atom (-F, -Cl, -Br, or -I). Halogens do not contain carbon.\n*   Therefore, the other substituent (Y) must contain both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n*   Let's consider possible C2 substituents containing a carbonyl group:\n    *   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** This has 2 carbons and a C=O. If this group is attached to the halo-benzene ring, the structure would be **halo-acetophenone** (C6H4(X)(COCH3)). This structure fits all the criteria: 8 carbons (6+2), di-substituted aromatic ring, a carbonyl group, and an aromatic-halogen bond.\n    *   **Formylmethyl group (-CH2CHO):** This also has 2 carbons and a C=O. The structure would be **halo-phenylacetaldehyde** (C6H4(X)(CH2CHO)). This structure also fits all the criteria.\n    *   Other groups like carboxymethyl (-CH2COOH) or methoxycarbonyl (-COOCH3) would also fit the carbon count and functional group requirement, but we will see that their expected NMR spectra do not match any of the options.\n\n**3. Analyze the 1H NMR Options**\n\nThe key to solving the problem is to match the predicted 1H NMR spectrum of our candidate structures with the given options. A di-substituted benzene ring will have 4 aromatic protons.\n\n*   **Option A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum shows no signals in the typical aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm). It cannot be the correct answer.\n\n*   **Option C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum shows only one aromatic proton (1H, s), which would suggest a tetra-substituted ring, contradicting the \"di-substituted\" information. It cannot be the correct answer.\n\n*   **Option B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`. This pattern of two doublets, each for 2 protons, is highly characteristic of a **para (1,4)-substituted** benzene ring. The chemical shifts, being far downfield (>7.5 ppm), indicate that both substituents are electron-withdrawing.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** `2.3 (3H, s)`. A singlet integrating to 3 protons in this region (~2.1-2.6 ppm) is the classic signal for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl (**-COCH3**).\n    *   **Matching Structure:** This spectrum perfectly matches the description of **p-halo-acetophenone**. The acetyl group (-COCH3) and the halogen (-X) are both electron-withdrawing and are in a para arrangement. The total proton count is 4 (aromatic) + 3 (methyl) = 7H, which matches the integration (2H + 2H + 3H = 7H).\n\n*   **Option D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Characteristic Peaks:** The signal at `9.9 (1H, s)` is unmistakably an **aldehyde proton** (-CHO). The signal at `3.7 (2H, s)` is consistent with a methylene group adjacent to both an aromatic ring and a carbonyl (-Ar-**CH2**-CHO).\n    *   **Matching Structure:** This data points towards the **p-halo-phenylacetaldehyde** structure.\n    *   **Inconsistency:** However, there is a major problem. The aromatic signals are at `7.8` and `7.6` ppm. For a phenylacetaldehyde, the electron-withdrawing aldehyde group is insulated from the ring by a CH2 group. Its effect on the ring is minimal. The aromatic protons should therefore appear much closer to the region for a simple halobenzene, around 7.2-7.4 ppm. The downfield shifts of 7.6-7.8 ppm are inconsistent with this structure. Such strong deshielding requires direct conjugation of the ring with an electron-withdrawing group like a carbonyl, as seen in acetophenone.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\n*   Option B describes the NMR spectrum of p-halo-acetophenone. All features of the spectrum (aromatic pattern, aromatic shifts, aliphatic signal) are consistent with this structure.\n*   Option D contains an internal contradiction: the aliphatic signals point to a phenylacetaldehyde structure, but the aromatic signals are in a region that is chemically incorrect for that structure.\n*   Therefore, the compound is a halo-acetophenone, and the correct 1H NMR data is given in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis question asks to identify the correct ¹H NMR data for a specific chemical compound. Let's break down the information given to deduce the structure of the compound and predict its NMR spectrum.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula and Basic Structure:**\n    *   The compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" This means we start with a benzene ring (C₆H₆) and replace two hydrogen atoms with two substituent groups. The core is C₆H₄.\n    *   The total number of carbon atoms is 8. Since the ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   The FTIR data confirms the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X, where X is a halogen like Cl, Br, or I).\n\n2.  **Determine the Substituents and Isomers:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen atom (-X), which contains no carbon atoms.\n    *   The other substituent must therefore contain both the carbonyl group and the two carbon atoms. The most common and stable chemical group fitting this description is an **acetyl group** (-COCH₃).\n    *   So, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. Its molecular formula is C₈H₇XO.\n    *   Since it is di-substituted, the halogen and the acetyl group can be arranged in three possible ways on the benzene ring: *ortho* (1,2-), *meta* (1,3-), or *para* (1,4-).\n\n3.  **Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Isomer:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (on the C₆H₄ ring):** There are 4 protons on the ring.\n        *   For *ortho* and *meta* isomers, the molecule is unsymmetrical. This would result in four distinct signals for the four aromatic protons, likely appearing as complex multiplets.\n        *   For the ***para* (1,4-) isomer**, the molecule is symmetrical. There are only two distinct types of aromatic protons. The two protons next to the acetyl group are equivalent, and the two protons next to the halogen are equivalent. This symmetry results in a very characteristic pattern: **two doublets**, each integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Substituent Protons (on the -COCH₃ group):**\n        *   The acetyl group has a methyl group (-CH₃). These three protons are equivalent and have no adjacent protons to couple with, so they will appear as a **singlet** integrating to **3H**. The chemical shift for a methyl group next to a carbonyl (a methyl ketone) is typically around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Given NMR Data Options:**\n\n    *   **A) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **Aromatic Region:** It shows two doublets at 7.8 and 7.6 ppm, each for 2 hydrogens. This is the classic signature of a **para-substituted** aromatic ring. The downfield chemical shifts (>7.5 ppm) are consistent with protons on a ring attached to two electron-withdrawing groups (both halogens and the acetyl group are deactivating/electron-withdrawing).\n        *   **Aliphatic Region:** It shows a singlet at 2.3 ppm for 3 hydrogens. This perfectly matches the signal for an acetyl methyl group.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This data is a perfect match for a **para-haloacetophenone**.\n\n    *   **B) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton, not a ketone. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   The integration in the aromatic region is incorrect. A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 protons, not 5 (1H + 2H + 2H). This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   There are no signals in the typical aromatic proton region (usually 6.5-8.5 ppm). This contradicts the fact that the compound has an aromatic ring. This option is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, option A is the only one that correctly describes the ¹H NMR spectrum for the compound deduced from the problem statement (a para-haloacetophenone).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Information from the Question:**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us we have a benzene ring (C6H4) with two substituent groups attached.\n    *   **\"8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring has 6 carbons, so the two substituents together must contain 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum...carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents must contain a C=O group.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum...aromatic-halogen bond\"**: One of the substituents is a halogen atom (-F, -Cl, -Br, or -I) directly attached to the aromatic ring. Let's denote this as -X.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure of the Substituents:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen, -X. This substituent contains 0 carbon atoms.\n    *   Therefore, the other substituent must contain both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n    *   Let's consider possible C2 groups that contain a carbonyl (C=O):\n        *   **Acetyl group (-COCH3)**: This has 2 carbons and a carbonyl group. This is a very common substituent.\n        *   **Formylmethyl group (-CH2CHO)**: This also has 2 carbons and a carbonyl group (in an aldehyde).\n        *   Other possibilities like a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or a carboxylic acid group (-CH2COOH) also fit the carbon count and carbonyl requirement.\n\n3.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data in the Options:**\n    *   Let's look for patterns. Options B and D both show a similar pattern in the aromatic region: `~7.8 (2H, d)` and `~7.6 (2H, d)`. This means there are two signals, each representing two equivalent protons, and each is a doublet. This is a classic, textbook pattern for a **para- (1,4) disubstituted** benzene ring. The symmetry of the para substitution makes the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to the two on the other.\n    *   Options A and C do not show signals in the typical aromatic proton chemical shift range (6.5-8.5 ppm), or the patterns do not match a disubstituted benzene ring. They can be eliminated.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Remaining Options (B and D) with Plausible Structures:**\n\n    *   **Candidate Structure 1: p-Haloacetophenone.**\n        *   This structure consists of a benzene ring with a halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH3) in a para arrangement.\n        *   It fits all initial criteria: di-substituted aromatic ring, 8 total carbons (6+2), carbonyl group, and aromatic-halogen bond.\n        *   **Predicted 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n            *   **Aromatic Protons:** Two doublets, each integrating to 2H, due to the para substitution. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carbonyl group will be further downfield. This matches the `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)` pattern.\n            *   **Aliphatic Protons:** A methyl group (-CH3) is attached to a carbonyl. It has no adjacent protons, so it will appear as a **singlet (s)**. It will integrate to **3H**. Its typical chemical shift is around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n        *   **Compare with Option D:** `1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)`. This is a **perfect match** for the predicted spectrum of p-haloacetophenone.\n\n    *   **Candidate Structure 2: (p-Halophenyl)acetaldehyde.**\n        *   This structure has a halogen (-X) and a formylmethyl group (-CH2CHO) in a para arrangement.\n        *   It also fits all initial criteria.\n        *   **Predicted 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n            *   **Aromatic Protons:** Two doublets, each for 2H. This matches the `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)` pattern.\n            *   **Aldehyde Proton (-CHO):** A very downfield signal, typically 9-10 ppm. It is adjacent to the -CH2- group, so it should be split into a **triplet (t)**. It would integrate to **1H**.\n            *   **Methylene Protons (-CH2-):** A signal deshielded by the ring and the carbonyl, typically ~3.5-4.0 ppm. It is adjacent to the -CHO proton, so it should be split into a **doublet (d)**. It would integrate to **2H**.\n        *   **Compare with Option B:** `1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)`. The chemical shifts are plausible for this structure. However, the splitting pattern is incorrect. Both the aldehyde and methylene protons are listed as **singlets (s)**, not the expected triplet and doublet. While small coupling constants can sometimes appear as singlets, this is less likely and makes the data a poorer fit than option D.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The 1H NMR data in option D is a textbook, unambiguous match for p-haloacetophenone, a structure that perfectly satisfies all the conditions given in the problem statement. The data in option B, while corresponding to another plausible structure, has a questionable splitting pattern. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Compound's Description:**\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This is a benzene ring (C6H4) with two substituents.\n*   **8 carbon atoms in total:** The benzene ring has 6 carbons, so the two substituents together must contain 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **FTIR - Carbonyl group:** The compound contains a C=O group.\n*   **FTIR - Aromatic-halogen bond:** A halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the aromatic ring.\n\n**2. Propose Candidate Structures:**\n\nBased on the information above, one substituent is a halogen (-X). The other substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group. Let's consider the possibilities for this second substituent:\n\n*   **An acetyl group:** -C(=O)CH3. This has two carbons and a carbonyl group. The resulting compound would be a **haloacetophenone**. The total carbon count is 6 (ring) + 2 (substituent) = 8. This is a strong candidate.\n*   **A formyl-methyl group:** -CH2CHO. This also has two carbons and a carbonyl group. The resulting compound would be a **(halophenyl)acetaldehyde**. The total carbon count is 6 (ring) + 2 (substituent) = 8. This is another strong candidate.\n\n**3. Analyze the 1H NMR Options:**\n\nLet's examine the provided NMR data to see which structure it supports. The options that show signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm) are A and C. Options B and D can be quickly eliminated.\n\n*   **Option B:** Has no signals in the aromatic region. This contradicts the presence of an aromatic ring.\n*   **Option D:** Shows only one aromatic proton (1H, s). A di-substituted benzene ring has four protons. This is incorrect.\n\nNow, let's analyze the plausible options, A and C. Both show a pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H (`7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`). This is a classic signature for **para (1,4) substitution** on a benzene ring, where the two substituents are different enough electronically to create an AA'BB' system that appears as two distinct doublets.\n\nSo, we are comparing **4-haloacetophenone** and **4-halo-phenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**4. Evaluate Option A vs. Option C:**\n\n*   **Option A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Structure Match:** This spectrum corresponds to **4-halo-phenylacetaldehyde**.\n        *   `9.9 (1H, s)`: This is the characteristic chemical shift for an **aldehyde proton** (-CHO).\n        *   `3.7 (2H, s)`: This is a typical shift for a **methylene group** (-CH2-) adjacent to both an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group.\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`: Aromatic protons.\n    *   **Consistency Check:** The group attached to the ring is -CH2CHO. The electron-withdrawing carbonyl group is insulated from the ring by a CH2 group. Therefore, the -CH2CHO group is only weakly deactivating. It would not shift the aromatic protons so far downfield to 7.6-7.8 ppm. The expected shifts would be much closer to those of toluene or ethylbenzene (around 7.1-7.3 ppm). For example, the protons of 4-chlorophenylacetaldehyde appear around 7.3 and 7.2 ppm. The aromatic shifts in this option are inconsistent with the proposed structure.\n\n*   **Option C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Structure Match:** This spectrum corresponds to **4-haloacetophenone**.\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This is in the region for a **methyl group** (-CH3). The singlet multiplicity indicates it's next to a quaternary carbon, like the carbonyl carbon in an acetyl group.\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`: Aromatic protons.\n    *   **Consistency Check:** The group attached to the ring is an acetyl group, -C(=O)CH3. The carbonyl is directly attached to the ring and is a strong electron-withdrawing group. This deshields the aromatic protons, especially those ortho to the acetyl group, pushing their chemical shifts significantly downfield. Shifts of 7.6-7.8 ppm are very characteristic for this type of structure. For example, 4-bromoacetophenone shows peaks at 7.82 and 7.61 ppm. The aromatic data is a very good fit. The methyl group shift at 2.3 ppm is slightly more upfield than the typical ~2.6 ppm for acetophenones, but this is a much smaller and more plausible discrepancy than the large error in the aromatic shifts in Option A.\n\n**5. Conclusion:**\n\nThe chemical shifts of aromatic protons are a strong indicator of the electronic nature of the substituents. The downfield shifts of 7.8 and 7.6 ppm strongly support the presence of a powerful, directly attached electron-withdrawing group like the acetyl group in 4-haloacetophenone. The data in Option A is inconsistent with the electronic effects of a -CH2CHO group. Therefore, Option C is the best match for the described compound.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Molecular Information:**\n*   **Core Structure:** A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, which is a benzene ring (C6H4) with two groups attached.\n*   **Total Carbon Atoms:** 8. Since the benzene ring itself has 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbons (8 - 6 = 2).\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):**\n    *   A carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   An aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X), meaning a halogen (like F, Cl, Br, I) is directly attached to the benzene ring.\n\n**2. Deduce the Molecular Structure:**\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X). This substituent has 0 carbon atoms.\n*   Therefore, the other substituent must contain both of the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group.\n*   Let's consider possible structures for a two-carbon substituent containing a C=O group:\n    *   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** This fits perfectly. It has 2 carbons and a carbonyl group. The resulting molecule would be a halo-acetophenone (X-C6H4-COCH3).\n    *   **Phenylacetaldehyde derivative (-CH2CHO):** This also fits. The substituent -CH2CHO has 2 carbons and a carbonyl group. The resulting molecule would be a halo-phenylacetaldehyde (X-C6H4-CH2CHO).\n*   Both `X-C6H4-COCH3` and `X-C6H4-CH2CHO` are valid structures based on the initial description. Both have 8 carbons, a di-substituted ring, a carbonyl, and an aromatic-halogen bond. The molecular formula for both would be C8H7XO, meaning they have 7 protons.\n\n**3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectra for the Possible Structures:**\nThe options present spectra with two doublets in the aromatic region, which is characteristic of a **1,4- (para) substitution pattern**. So we will assume para-substitution for our analysis.\n\n*   **Case 1: para-halo-acetophenone (p-X-C6H4-COCH3)**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (4H):** The benzene ring has two types of protons. The two protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group will be strongly deshielded. The two protons ortho to the halogen will also be deshielded, but typically less so. We expect two doublets in the region of **~7.4-8.0 ppm**.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (3H):** The methyl group (-CH3) is attached to a carbonyl. This deshields the protons. We expect a singlet (no adjacent protons) around **~2.3-2.6 ppm**.\n    *   **Total Protons:** 4H (aromatic) + 3H (methyl) = 7H.\n\n*   **Case 2: para-halo-phenylacetaldehyde (p-X-C6H4-CH2CHO)**\n    *   **Aldehyde Proton (1H):** The aldehyde proton (-CHO) is highly deshielded. We expect a singlet around **~9.5-10.0 ppm**.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (4H):** The -CH2CHO group is less electron-withdrawing than a directly attached carbonyl. The aromatic protons would be less deshielded than in Case 1. We expect two doublets in the region of **~7.1-7.4 ppm**.\n    *   **Methylene Protons (2H):** The benzylic methylene protons (-CH2-) are deshielded by both the ring and the adjacent carbonyl. We expect a singlet around **~3.6-3.8 ppm**.\n    *   **Total Protons:** 1H (aldehyde) + 4H (aromatic) + 2H (methylene) = 7H.\n\n**4. Analyze the Given Options:**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   Incorrect. It lacks signals in the typical aromatic region (7-8 ppm).\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum appears to describe the phenylacetaldehyde structure (Case 2), with the aldehyde (9.9 ppm) and methylene (3.7 ppm) protons matching well. However, the aromatic shifts (7.8 and 7.6 ppm) are too high (too deshielded). They are characteristic of a ketone directly attached to the ring (Case 1), not a phenylacetaldehyde. This option contains an internal inconsistency.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum is a perfect match for our prediction for para-halo-acetophenone (Case 1).\n    *   **7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, consistent with a para-substituted ring bearing a strong electron-withdrawing group. Total integration is 4H.\n    *   **2.3 (3H, s):** A singlet in the correct region for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl. Integration is 3H.\n    *   Total integration is 7H. This is a chemically consistent and accurate spectrum for the structure.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   Incorrect. A di-substituted benzene ring should have 4 aromatic protons, not 1. The integrations are also inconsistent with any likely structure.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe NMR data in option C perfectly matches the predicted spectrum for a para-halo-acetophenone, which is a valid structure derived from the problem description. The data in option B, while appearing plausible at first glance, contains chemically inconsistent chemical shifts for the aromatic protons. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Molecular Information:**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This indicates a benzene ring (C6H4) with two substituents, let's call them X and Y.\n    *   **\"8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring itself contains 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents (X and Y) must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum ... carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents must contain a C=O group.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum ... aromatic-halogen bond\"**: One of the substituents is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly attached to the aromatic ring. Let's say this is substituent X.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure of the Substituents:**\n    *   Substituent X is a halogen (-X). It contains 0 carbon atoms.\n    *   Substituent Y must therefore contain both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n    *   A functional group with 2 carbons and a carbonyl group is an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n    *   Therefore, the two substituents are a halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n\n3.  **Assemble the Final Structure:**\n    *   The compound is a haloacetophenone, with the general structure X-C6H4-COCH3. The total carbon count is 6 (ring) + 2 (acetyl) = 8. This matches all the given information.\n\n4.  **Analyze Potential Isomers and their Expected 1H NMR:**\n    *   The two substituents can be in the ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4) positions.\n    *   **Ortho and Meta Isomers**: These isomers lack symmetry. They would show four distinct signals in the aromatic region (between ~7.0-8.0 ppm), each integrating to 1H, with complex splitting patterns (doublets, triplets, doublet of doublets, etc.).\n    *   **Para Isomer (1,4-disubstitution)**: This isomer has a plane of symmetry passing through the two substituents. This symmetry makes the two protons ortho to the acetyl group equivalent to each other, and the two protons ortho to the halogen group equivalent to each other.\n        *   This results in a simpler aromatic spectrum: two signals, each a doublet, and each integrating to 2H.\n        *   The acetyl group is strongly electron-withdrawing, so the protons ortho to it will be more deshielded (further downfield, higher ppm value).\n        *   The methyl group (-CH3) of the acetyl substituent is not adjacent to any protons, so it will appear as a singlet, integrating to 3H. Its chemical shift is typically around 2.5-2.6 ppm.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Given 1H NMR Options:**\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: ... 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The peak at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a ketone. This contradicts our deduced structure of an acetophenone. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: ... 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **Aromatic region**: 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d). This is the classic A2B2 pattern for a para (1,4)-disubstituted benzene ring. It matches our predicted pattern for the para-isomer.\n        *   **Aliphatic region**: 2.3 (3H, s). This is a singlet integrating to 3 protons, which is exactly what we expect for the methyl group of the acetyl substituent.\n        *   While the chemical shift of 2.3 ppm is slightly lower than the typical ~2.6 ppm for an acetyl methyl, the overall pattern (two 2H doublets and one 3H singlet) is a perfect match for 4-haloacetophenone. The minor shift variation is acceptable. This option is a very strong candidate.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: ... 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum lacks any signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm). This cannot be the correct spectrum for an aromatic compound. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: ... 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   This shows only a single proton in the aromatic region, which is inconsistent with a di-substituted benzene ring (which must have 4 aromatic protons). This option is incorrect.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    Based on the analysis, the structure must be a haloacetophenone. Only Option B provides a spectrum that matches the signal pattern (multiplicity and integration) expected for such a compound, specifically the para-isomer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Molecular Formula and Functional Groups from the Clues:**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us the core of the molecule is a benzene ring (C6H4) with two substituent groups attached.\n*   **\"8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents together must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"FTIR ... carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents must contain a C=O functional group.\n*   **\"FTIR ... aromatic-halogen bond\"**: This means one substituent is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) bonded directly to the aromatic ring. Let's denote it as '-X'.\n\n**2. Assemble the Molecular Structure:**\n\n*   We have two substituents on a benzene ring.\n*   One substituent is a halogen, -X. This substituent contains 0 carbon atoms.\n*   The other substituent must therefore contain both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms AND the carbonyl group.\n*   Let's consider possible structures for a 2-carbon substituent containing a carbonyl group:\n    *   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** This has 2 carbons and a C=O. This is a very common substituent.\n    *   **Carboxylic acid group (-CH2COOH):** This has 2 carbons and a C=O, but would also have a very characteristic broad singlet for the acidic -OH proton, typically above 10 ppm. None of the options show this.\n    *   **Acetaldehyde group (-CH2CHO):** This has 2 carbons and a C=O (aldehyde). This is also a possibility.\n\n*   Let's evaluate the two most likely structures:\n    *   **Structure 1: Halo-acetophenone.** A halogen and an acetyl group on a benzene ring. The formula would be X-C6H5-COCH3. This has 6 (ring) + 2 (acetyl) = 8 carbons. It fits all the criteria.\n    *   **Structure 2: (Halo-phenyl)acetaldehyde.** A halogen and a -CH2CHO group on a benzene ring. The formula is X-C6H5-CH2CHO. This has 6 (ring) + 2 (substituent) = 8 carbons. It also fits all the criteria.\n\n**3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Potential Structure and Compare with Options:**\n\nTo have a simple, clean NMR spectrum with doublets in the aromatic region, the most likely substitution pattern is **para (1,4)**. This symmetry results in only two types of aromatic protons.\n\n*   **Prediction for para-halo-acetophenone (Structure 1):**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (C6H4):** In a para-substituted ring, there are two sets of equivalent protons. We expect two signals, each integrating to 2H. Due to coupling with their ortho neighbors, each signal should be a **doublet (d)**. The protons next to the electron-withdrawing carbonyl group will be shifted further downfield (higher ppm) than those next to the halogen. So we expect: `~7.5-8.0 ppm (2H, d)` and `~7.4-7.8 ppm (2H, d)`.\n    *   **Acetyl Protons (-COCH3):** The three protons on the methyl group are equivalent and have no adjacent protons to couple with. We expect one signal, integrating to 3H, as a **singlet (s)**. The typical chemical shift for a methyl ketone is around **2.1-2.6 ppm**.\n    *   **Summary for Structure 1:** Two doublets in the aromatic region (each 2H) and one singlet in the alkyl region (3H).\n\n*   **Prediction for para-(halo-phenyl)acetaldehyde (Structure 2):**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (C6H4):** Similar to above, we expect two **doublets (d)**, each integrating to 2H in the aromatic region (`~7.0-7.5 ppm`).\n    *   **Aldehyde Proton (-CHO):** The single proton of the aldehyde group is unique. It has a very characteristic chemical shift, typically **9.5-10.1 ppm**. It is adjacent to the -CH2- group, so it should be split into a **triplet (t)** by the two CH2 protons (n+1 rule, 2+1=3). We expect: `~9.7 ppm (1H, t)`.\n    *   **Methylene Protons (-CH2-):** The two protons of the methylene group are adjacent to the aldehyde proton. They will be split into a **doublet (d)** by the single aldehyde proton (n+1 rule, 1+1=2). The chemical shift would be around **3.5-4.0 ppm**. We expect: `~3.7 ppm (2H, d)`.\n    *   **Summary for Structure 2:** Two doublets (aromatic), one triplet (aldehyde), and one doublet (methylene).\n\n**4. Analyze the Given NMR Options:**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: ... 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**: The signals at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are not in the typical aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). This is incorrect.\n*   **B) 1H NMR: ... 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**: This option corresponds to Structure 2, the acetaldehyde derivative. It has the correct chemical shifts for the aldehyde proton (`9.9 ppm`), methylene protons (`3.7 ppm`), and aromatic protons (`7.8`, `7.6 ppm`). **However, the splitting is wrong.** The aldehyde proton should be a triplet, not a singlet, and the methylene protons should be a doublet, not a singlet, due to mutual coupling. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n*   **C) 1H NMR: ... 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**: Similar to A, the chemical shifts are not characteristic of an aromatic compound of this type. The integration and splitting are also unusual. This is incorrect.\n*   **D) 1H NMR: ... 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**: This data perfectly matches our prediction for **para-halo-acetophenone (Structure 1)**.\n    *   `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`: Two doublets in the aromatic region, each for 2H. This signifies a para-substituted ring.\n    *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: A singlet for 3H at a chemical shift characteristic of an acetyl methyl group.\n    \nAll aspects (chemical shifts, integration, and splitting) of this option are consistent with the proposed structure of para-halo-acetophenone, which fulfills all the conditions given in the problem statement.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Decode the Molecular Information from the Question:**\n\n*   **Structure:** A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This implies a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two substituents.\n*   **Total Carbons:** The molecule has 8 carbon atoms in total. Since the benzene ring itself has 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a combined total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **FTIR Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   A peak for a **carbonyl group (C=O)** is present.\n    *   A peak for an **aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X)** is present. This means one of the substituents is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) attached directly to the aromatic ring.\n\n**2. Propose Possible Structures:**\n\nBased on the information above, let's assemble the molecule:\n*   We have a halogen substituent (-X). Halogens do not contain carbon.\n*   Therefore, the other substituent must contain both the carbonyl group and the two required carbon atoms.\n*   A very common chemical group that fits this description is the **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**. It has two carbons and a carbonyl group.\n\nCombining these pieces, the most likely structure is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula would be C₈H₇XO.\n*   Total Carbons: 6 (ring) + 2 (acetyl) = 8. (Correct)\n*   Substituents: A halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH₃). It is di-substituted. (Correct)\n*   Functional Groups: It has an aromatic-halogen bond and a carbonyl group. (Correct)\n*   Total Protons: The benzene ring has 4 protons (C₆H₄), and the methyl group has 3 protons (-CH₃). The total is 4 + 3 = 7 protons.\n\nAnother possibility could be a (halophenyl)acetaldehyde (X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO). This also has 8 carbons, a carbonyl, and an Ar-X bond. We will evaluate the NMR data for both possibilities.\n\n**3. Analyze the 1H NMR Options:**\n\nThe correct 1H NMR spectrum must account for 7 protons and match the expected chemical shifts and splitting patterns for our proposed structure(s). Aromatic protons typically appear in the δ 6.5-8.5 ppm range.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: δ 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Integration:** 1+2+2+2 = 7 protons. This matches.\n    *   **Analysis:** The chemical shifts at δ 4.6 and 4.8 ppm are too low (upfield) for aromatic protons. Only one aromatic proton (1H) is listed. This is inconsistent with a di-substituted benzene ring which must have 4 aromatic protons. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: δ 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Integration:** 2+2+3 = 7 protons. This matches.\n    *   **Analysis:** This spectrum has no signals in the typical aromatic region (δ 6.5-8.5 ppm). The signals at δ 4.6-4.8 are not characteristic of aromatic protons. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: δ 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Integration:** 1+2+2+2 = 7 protons. This matches.\n    *   **Analysis:** This spectrum corresponds to the (halophenyl)acetaldehyde structure (X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO).\n        *   `δ 9.9 (1H, s)`: Correct region for an aldehyde proton (-CHO).\n        *   `δ 7.8 (2H, d)` & `δ 7.6 (2H, d)`: A pattern of two doublets (each 2H) is characteristic of a **1,4- (para) substituted** benzene ring.\n        *   `δ 3.7 (2H, s)`: Plausible region for the methylene protons (-CH₂-).\n        *   **Splitting Error:** However, in the structure X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO, the methylene (-CH₂) protons are adjacent to the aldehyde (-CHO) proton. Due to spin-spin coupling, they must split each other's signals. The -CH₂- signal should be a **doublet**, and the -CHO signal should be a **triplet**. The data incorrectly lists them both as **singlets (s)**. Therefore, this option is chemically incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: δ 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Integration:** 2+2+3 = 7 protons. This matches.\n    *   **Analysis:** This spectrum is a perfect match for a **para-haloacetophenone (p-X-C₆H₄-COCH₃)**.\n        *   `δ 7.8 (2H, d)` & `δ 7.6 (2H, d)`: This is the classic pattern for a **para-disubstituted** benzene ring. The acetyl group is strongly electron-withdrawing, shifting these protons downfield into the correct range.\n        *   `δ 2.3 (3H, s)`: This is the characteristic signal for an acetyl methyl group (-COCH**₃**). It is a **singlet (s)** because it is not adjacent to any other protons. The chemical shift around δ 2.3-2.6 ppm is expected.\n\n**4. Conclusion:**\n\nThe data in option D perfectly matches the predicted 1H NMR spectrum for para-haloacetophenone, a molecule that satisfies all the conditions given in the problem statement. The data in option C contains an error in the splitting pattern that makes it inconsistent with its corresponding structure.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the given information to determine the compound's structure.**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us the core structure is a benzene ring with two substituent groups attached. A benzene ring itself has the formula C6H6. When di-substituted, it's C6H4R1R2.\n    *   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents together must contain 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum...indicate the presence of a carbonyl group\"**: This means there is a C=O group in one of the substituents.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum...indicate the presence of an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: This means one of the substituents is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly attached to the benzene ring. Let's call this substituent -X.\n\n2.  **Assemble the molecular structure.**\n    *   We have one halogen substituent (-X), which contains 0 carbon atoms.\n    *   The other substituent must therefore contain both the carbonyl group (C=O) and the 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   The most common and stable functional group that fits this description is the **acetyl group** (-COCH3). It has exactly 2 carbons and a carbonyl group.\n    *   So, the compound is an **acetophenone** molecule with a halogen substituent on the ring. The general structure is **haloacetophenone**.\n    *   The molecular formula would be C8H7XO. This gives a total of 7 protons (4 on the aromatic ring and 3 on the methyl group), which we should see in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n3.  **Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for the proposed structure.**\n    *   The structure is a di-substituted benzene ring. The substitution can be *ortho* (1,2), *meta* (1,3), or *para* (1,4).\n    *   **The Acetyl Group (-COCH3)**: The three protons on the methyl group are equivalent and are adjacent to a carbonyl group but have no adjacent protons. They will appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. The typical chemical shift for a methyl ketone is around **2.1-2.6 ppm**.\n    *   **The Aromatic Protons (on the C6H4 ring)**: There are 4 protons on the ring.\n        *   If the substitution is *ortho* or *meta*, the molecule would be asymmetric. We would expect four distinct signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm), each integrating to 1H, with complex splitting patterns (e.g., doublets, triplets, doublets of doublets).\n        *   If the substitution is ***para***, the molecule has a plane of symmetry. This makes the two protons ortho to the acetyl group equivalent to each other, and the two protons ortho to the halogen equivalent to each other. This creates a classic AA'BB' system, which in many cases simplifies and appears as **two distinct doublets (d)**, each integrating to **2H**.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the given 1H NMR options against the prediction.**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This perfectly matches the signal for the acetyl methyl group (-COCH3).\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: This pattern of two doublets, each for 2H, is the characteristic signature of a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring.\n        *   The total integration is 3H + 2H + 2H = 7H, which is correct.\n        *   **This spectrum is a perfect match for a 4-haloacetophenone.**\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at `9.9 (1H, s)` is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a ketone. The compound identified is a ketone. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signals at `4.8` and `4.6 ppm` are not in the typical range for aromatic protons (which are usually > 6.5 ppm). This data does not represent an aromatic compound of the type we identified.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   Similar to option C, the chemical shifts `4.8` and `4.6 ppm` are incorrect for aromatic protons. The signal at `1.3 (3H, s)` is too upfield for a methyl ketone.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis, the compound must be a 4-haloacetophenone. Option A provides the exact 1H NMR data pattern expected for this structure: a singlet for the methyl group and a pair of doublets for the para-substituted aromatic ring.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Information from the Question:**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us we have a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two substituent groups attached. The substitution can be ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4).\n*   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring has 6 carbons. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms (8 - 6 = 2).\n*   **\"FTIR ... carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents contains a C=O group.\n*   **\"FTIR ... aromatic-halogen bond\"**: A halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I, let's denote it as -X) is directly attached to the aromatic ring. This is one of the two substituents.\n\n**2. Determine the Molecular Structure:**\n\n*   We have two substituents: a halogen (-X) and a group containing 2 carbons and a carbonyl group.\n*   Let's figure out the structure of the second substituent. It must have the formula C₂HᵧO.\n*   Possible structures for this C₂ substituent with a carbonyl group are:\n    *   **Acetyl group:** -C(=O)CH₃. This has 2 carbons and fits the description.\n    *   **Formylmethyl group:** -CH₂CHO. This also has 2 carbons and fits the description.\n*   Now, let's attach these possibilities to the halo-benzene ring.\n    *   **Structure I:** Halo-acetophenone (X-C₆H₄-C(=O)CH₃)\n    *   **Structure II:** Halo-phenylacetaldehyde (X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO)\n*   Both structures have a total of 8 carbons (6 from the ring, 2 from the side chain), a carbonyl group, and an aromatic-halogen bond. They both fit the initial description.\n\n**3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectra for the Possible Structures:**\n\nTo distinguish between the two possibilities and the different substitution patterns (ortho, meta, para), let's predict what their 1H NMR spectra would look like. We need a total of 7 protons (4 on the ring, 3 on the side chain for acetophenone; 4 on the ring, 3 on the side chain for phenylacetaldehyde).\n\n*   **Predicted Spectrum for Halo-acetophenone (Structure I):**\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-CH₃):** The three protons on the methyl group are adjacent to a carbonyl group, which has no protons. Therefore, they will appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. The typical chemical shift is around **2.0-2.6 ppm**.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** There are 4 protons on the ring.\n        *   If the substitution is **para (1,4)**, the molecule is symmetric. We will see two signals, each a **doublet (d)** and each integrating to **2H**. This is a very characteristic pattern. The chemical shift will be in the aromatic region, ~7.4-8.0 ppm, because the acetyl group is strongly electron-withdrawing.\n        *   If the substitution is ortho or meta, the pattern will be more complex, with four distinct signals for the 4 protons.\n\n*   **Predicted Spectrum for Halo-phenylacetaldehyde (Structure II):**\n    *   **Aldehyde Proton (-CHO):** This single proton is adjacent to the -CH₂- group. It will appear as a **triplet (t)**, integrating to **1H**. It is highly deshielded and will appear far downfield, typically **~9.5-10.0 ppm**.\n    *   **Methylene Protons (-CH₂-):** These two protons are adjacent to the aldehyde proton (-CHO). They will appear as a **doublet (d)**, integrating to **2H**. The typical chemical shift is around **3.5-4.0 ppm**.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** There are 4 protons. A **para** substitution would again give a pattern of two **doublets (d)**, each for **2H**. Because the electron-withdrawing carbonyl is not directly attached to the ring, the chemical shifts would be less downfield than for acetophenone, perhaps around ~7.1-7.5 ppm.\n\n**4. Compare Predicted Spectra with the Given Options:**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This option lacks any signals in the aromatic region (7-8 ppm). The signals at 4.6-4.8 ppm are too upfield. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum shows a signal at 9.9 ppm (aldehyde), two doublets in the aromatic region (para-substitution), and a signal at 3.7 ppm (methylene). This matches the functional groups of Structure II (halo-phenylacetaldehyde).\n    *   However, there are discrepancies: the aldehyde and methylene protons are shown as singlets (s), not a triplet and a doublet. Also, the aromatic protons are very far downfield (7.6-7.8 ppm), which is more typical for a group directly attached to the ring like in acetophenone.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This option does not show a clear pattern for either proposed structure. It has signals outside the aromatic region and an unusual integration and multiplicity. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **`7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`**: This is the classic, textbook pattern for a **para-substituted benzene ring**. It indicates 4 aromatic protons, split into two sets of 2.\n    *   **`2.3 (3H, s)`**: This is a perfect match for a **methyl group next to a carbonyl** (-C(=O)CH₃). A 3H singlet around 2.3 ppm is highly characteristic.\n    *   This spectrum perfectly matches our prediction for **para-halo-acetophenone (Structure I)**. Every detail (chemical shifts, integrations, multiplicities) is consistent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe data in option D provides a perfect match for p-halo-acetophenone. This molecule fits all the criteria given in the question: it is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, it has 8 carbon atoms, it contains a carbonyl group, and it has an aromatic-halogen bond. The NMR data is a textbook example for this structure. While the data in option B has some features of halo-phenylacetaldehyde, it has significant inconsistencies in multiplicity and chemical shift, making D the far better answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Decipher the Compound's Structure from the Description**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us the core of the molecule is a benzene ring with two groups attached to it. A benzene ring has 6 carbon atoms and, when di-substituted, 4 hydrogen atoms attached to the ring (C6H4).\n*   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum... indicate the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) as well as an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X)\"**: This tells us about the functional groups present. One substituent is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly attached to the aromatic ring. The other substituent must contain the two carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n\n**2. Assemble the Substituents**\n\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X).\n*   The other substituent must have the formula C2O. A very common and stable chemical group that fits this description is the acetyl group: -COCH3.\n*   Let's check other possibilities for a 2-carbon carbonyl-containing group. Another option is -CH2CHO.\n\n**3. Propose Candidate Structures**\n\n*   **Structure 1 (from -COCH3 substituent): Haloacetophenone.**\n    *   This compound consists of a benzene ring substituted with a halogen and an acetyl group.\n    *   Total carbons: 6 (ring) + 2 (acetyl) = 8. This matches.\n    *   It has the required functional groups (Ar-X, C=O).\n\n*   **Structure 2 (from -CH2CHO substituent): (Halophenyl)acetaldehyde.**\n    *   This compound consists of a benzene ring substituted with a halogen and a -CH2CHO group.\n    *   Total carbons: 6 (ring) + 2 (-CH2CHO) = 8. This also matches.\n    *   It has the required functional groups (Ar-X, C=O).\n\n**4. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Structure and Compare with Options**\n\nLet's analyze the expected signals for each structure. The substitution can be ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4). The provided options show a simple pattern (two doublets) in the aromatic region, which is highly characteristic of para (1,4) substitution. We will assume a para-substituted ring.\n\n*   **Prediction for para-Haloacetophenone (Structure 1)**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (C6H4)**: In a para-disubstituted ring, there are two sets of equivalent protons. This results in two signals, each appearing as a doublet due to splitting by the adjacent proton. Each doublet should integrate to 2H. The chemical shift will be in the aromatic region, typically 7.0-8.0 ppm.\n    *   **Acetyl Protons (-COCH3)**: The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent and have no adjacent protons. This will result in a singlet signal integrating to 3H. The chemical shift for a methyl group next to a carbonyl is typically 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n    *   **Summary Prediction:**\n        *   ~7-8 ppm (2H, d)\n        *   ~7-8 ppm (2H, d)\n        *   ~2.1-2.6 ppm (3H, s)\n\n*   **Prediction for para-(Halophenyl)acetaldehyde (Structure 2)**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (C6H4)**: Same as above, two doublets, each integrating to 2H, in the 7.0-8.0 ppm region.\n    *   **Aldehyde Proton (-CHO)**: The single proton of the aldehyde group is adjacent to the two CH2 protons. It should appear as a triplet. The chemical shift for an aldehyde proton is very distinct, typically 9.5-10.0 ppm.\n    *   **Methylene Protons (-CH2-)**: The two protons of the methylene group are adjacent to the single aldehyde proton. They should appear as a doublet. The chemical shift for protons on a carbon between a benzene ring and a carbonyl is typically 3.5-4.0 ppm.\n    *   **Summary Prediction:**\n        *   ~9.5-10.0 ppm (1H, t)\n        *   ~7-8 ppm (2H, d)\n        *   ~7-8 ppm (2H, d)\n        *   ~3.5-4.0 ppm (2H, d)\n\n**5. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   This matches the chemical shifts for the acetaldehyde structure (aldehyde H at 9.9, aromatic Hs at 7.8/7.6, methylene Hs at 3.7). However, the multiplicities are incorrect. The aldehyde proton should be a triplet (t), not a singlet (s), and the methylene protons should be a doublet (d), not a singlet (s). This option is incorrect due to the inconsistent splitting patterns.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum lacks signals in the typical aromatic proton region (7-8 ppm). It is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum shows two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2H, which is classic for a para-substituted ring.\n    *   It also shows a singlet integrating to 3H at 2.3 ppm, which is a perfect match for an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n    *   This data perfectly matches our prediction for para-haloacetophenone.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum also lacks signals in the aromatic proton region. It is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe 1H NMR data in option C is the only one that perfectly matches a molecule that satisfies all the conditions described in the problem. The molecule is a para-haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the given information:**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us the core of the molecule is a benzene ring with two groups attached to it (formula C₆H₄XY).\n    *   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring itself contains 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents (X and Y) must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum ... presence of a carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents must contain a C=O functional group.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum ... presence of an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: This means one of the substituents is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly attached to the aromatic ring. Let's designate this as -X.\n\n2.  **Determine the molecular structure:**\n    *   We have a halogen substituent (-X).\n    *   The other substituent must account for the remaining 2 carbon atoms and contain the carbonyl group.\n    *   The simplest and most common group that fits this description (2 carbons, one carbonyl) is the acetyl group, -COCH₃.\n    *   So, the compound is a haloacetophenone. The two substituents on the benzene ring are a halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH₃). The total carbon count is 6 (ring) + 2 (acetyl) = 8. This fits all the given criteria.\n\n3.  **Analyze the possible isomers and predict the 1H NMR spectrum:**\n    *   The two substituents can be arranged in three possible ways on the benzene ring: ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4).\n    *   Let's consider the symmetry of each isomer, as this greatly influences the 1H NMR spectrum:\n        *   **Ortho and Meta isomers**: These are asymmetrical. They would have four distinct signals for the four protons on the aromatic ring, likely resulting in a complex multiplet pattern.\n        *   **Para isomer**: This molecule has a plane of symmetry. This symmetry makes the two protons ortho to the acetyl group equivalent to each other, and the two protons ortho to the halogen equivalent to each other.\n    *   **Predicted spectrum for the para isomer (p-haloacetophenone):**\n        *   **Aromatic Region (6.5-8.5 ppm):** We expect two distinct signals for the aromatic protons.\n            *   One signal for the 2 protons next to the acetyl group.\n            *   One signal for the 2 protons next to the halogen.\n            *   Each signal will be a doublet because its protons are coupled to the other set of protons (ortho-coupling).\n            *   Therefore, the aromatic region should show two doublets, each integrating to 2H.\n        *   **Aliphatic Region:** We have the acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n            *   The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent and have no adjacent protons to couple with.\n            *   This will produce a singlet, integrating to 3H. The typical chemical shift for a methyl ketone (Ar-CO-CH₃) is around 2.2-2.6 ppm.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the given 1H NMR options:**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: This pattern of two doublets, each for 2 protons, in the aromatic region is the classic signature of a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This is a singlet for 3 protons, which perfectly corresponds to the methyl group of an acetyl substituent.\n        *   This option perfectly matches our predicted spectrum for p-haloacetophenone.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at `9.9 (1H, s)` is characteristic of an aldehyde proton, not a ketone. The rest of the signals do not fit a simple, logical structure consistent with the prompt.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   The chemical shifts `4.8` and `4.6` are not in the typical range for aromatic protons (6.5-8.5 ppm). This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   Again, the signals at `4.8` and `4.6` are not in the aromatic region. This option is incorrect.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The only 1H NMR data that is consistent with the deduced structure of p-haloacetophenone is Option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Structure from the Given Information:**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This indicates a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two substituents attached to it. The benzene ring itself accounts for 6 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: Since the benzene ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents together must contain 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of a carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents must contain a C=O group.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: This means a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the aromatic ring. This halogen atom is one of the two substituents.\n\nLet's assemble the structure:\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X).\n*   The other substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group. The simplest and most common chemical group that fits this description is an acetyl group (-COCH₃). This group contains a carbonyl (C=O) and two carbons.\n\nSo, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO.\n\n**2. Analyze the Possible Isomers and their Expected 1H NMR Spectra:**\n\nThe two substituents (-X and -COCH₃) can be arranged in three possible positions on the benzene ring: ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4).\n\n*   **Protons from the Acetyl Group:** The acetyl group (-COCH₃) has a methyl group. These 3 protons are not adjacent to any other protons, so they will always appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. The chemical shift for a methyl group next to a carbonyl (a methyl ketone) is typically around **2.0-2.6 ppm**.\n\n*   **Protons from the Aromatic Ring:** The benzene ring has 4 protons.\n    *   **Ortho (1,2) and Meta (1,3) Isomers:** In these arrangements, the molecule has low symmetry. The 4 aromatic protons would be chemically non-equivalent and would split each other, resulting in a complex pattern of multiplets (e.g., doublets, triplets, doublet of doublets) in the aromatic region of the spectrum (typically 6.5-8.0 ppm).\n    *   **Para (1,4) Isomer:** This isomer is highly symmetrical. There are only two types of aromatic protons due to a plane of symmetry passing through the two substituents.\n        *   The 2 protons ortho to the acetyl group are equivalent.\n        *   The 2 protons ortho to the halogen group are equivalent.\n        *   Each set of protons splits the other, so the aromatic region will show two distinct **doublets (d)**, each integrating to **2H**.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Given 1H NMR Options:**\n\nNow, let's compare the predicted spectra with the choices provided:\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The peak at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a ketone.\n    *   The singlet at 3.7 ppm integrates to 2H, not 3H, which is inconsistent with an acetyl methyl group. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d):** This pattern perfectly matches the expected signal for the 4 aromatic protons of a para (1,4)-disubstituted benzene ring. The integration (2H+2H=4H) is correct.\n    *   **2.3 (3H, s):** This is a singlet for 3 protons at 2.3 ppm, which is exactly what we expect for the methyl protons of an acetyl group.\n    *   This option perfectly matches the predicted spectrum for **4-haloacetophenone**.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum lacks signals in the typical aromatic proton region (around 7-8 ppm). The chemical shifts and splitting patterns are inconsistent with a haloacetophenone. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   Similar to option C, this spectrum is missing the characteristic aromatic proton signals. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe structure that fits all the information provided is 4-haloacetophenone. The 1H NMR data in option B is the only one that corresponds to this structure.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n*   **Step 1: Deconstruct the information provided in the question.**\n    1.  **Molecular Formula information:** The compound has a total of 8 carbon atoms. It is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. The aromatic ring itself (benzene) accounts for 6 carbon atoms (C6). Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms (8 total C - 6 ring C = 2 C).\n    2.  **Functional Group information (from FTIR):**\n        *   A peak indicates a carbonyl group (C=O).\n        *   A peak indicates an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X, where X is a halogen like F, Cl, Br, or I).\n    3.  **Structural deductions:**\n        *   We have a benzene ring with two groups attached (di-substituted).\n        *   One substituent is a halogen atom (-X) directly attached to the ring.\n        *   The other substituent must contain the remaining atoms: 2 carbons and 1 oxygen, including a C=O group. The most plausible and common group that fits this description is an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n\n*   **Step 2: Propose the most likely structure.**\n    *   Combining the deductions from Step 1, the compound is a haloacetophenone. The molecular structure consists of a benzene ring substituted with one halogen atom and one acetyl group.\n    *   The molecular formula is C8H7XO. This fits all the initial criteria.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the 1H NMR spectral features based on the proposed structure.**\n    *   The structure is a di-substituted benzene ring. This means there are 4 protons on the aromatic ring. The substitution pattern (ortho, meta, or para) will determine the splitting pattern of these protons.\n    *   Let's examine the patterns in the options provided, specifically in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm).\n        *   Options B and C show a pattern of `(2H, d)` and `(2H, d)`. This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is highly characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The symmetry of the para isomer results in only two distinct types of aromatic protons, which split each other into doublets.\n    *   So, we can refine our proposed structure to be a **para-haloacetophenone**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Predict the complete 1H NMR spectrum for para-haloacetophenone and compare it with the given options.**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** There are two sets of equivalent protons.\n        1.  The two protons ortho (adjacent) to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group (-COCH3). These will be deshielded and appear further downfield.\n        2.  The two protons ortho to the halogen atom (-X).\n        *   These two sets split each other, giving two doublets. The integration will be 2H for each doublet. Their chemical shift will be in the range of ~7.5-8.0 ppm.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There is one methyl group (-CH3) from the acetyl substituent.\n        *   These three protons are equivalent.\n        *   They are attached to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons on it, so they will appear as a **singlet** (no splitting).\n        *   The integration will be 3H.\n        *   The typical chemical shift for a methyl ketone (Ar-CO-CH3) is around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:** ~7.5-8.0 ppm (4H total, split into two doublets of 2H each) and ~2.1-2.6 ppm (3H, singlet).\n\n*   **Step 5: Match the predicted spectrum with the options.**\n    *   A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)\n        *   Incorrect. The chemical shifts are not in the aromatic region.\n    *   B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)\n        *   Incorrect. The peak at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde, not a ketone. This would correspond to a different structure, and the multiplicities are inconsistent for that structure anyway.\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **This is a perfect match.** It shows the two doublets for the 4 aromatic protons of a para-substituted ring (`7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`) and the singlet for the 3 methyl protons of the acetyl group at a characteristic chemical shift (`2.3 (3H, s)`).\n    *   D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)\n        *   Incorrect. The aromatic region is wrong (only 1H), and the other signals do not match.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n*   **Step 1: Deconstruct the problem statement to deduce the compound's structural features.**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This means we have a benzene ring (C6H4) with two substituents.\n    *   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring has 6 carbons, so the two substituents together must contain 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum... indicate the presence of a carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents contains a C=O group.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum... as well as an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: This means one substituent is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly attached to the benzene ring. Let's denote it as -X.\n\n*   **Step 2: Combine the structural features to propose candidate molecules.**\n    *   We have two substituents on a benzene ring: one is a halogen (-X), and the other must contain the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n    *   Let's figure out the C2 substituent with a carbonyl group. Two possibilities are most common:\n        1.  An **acetyl group** (-COCH3). This has two carbons and a carbonyl group. The resulting compound would be a **haloacetophenone**. The total formula is C8H7XO.\n        2.  A **(formylmethyl) group** (-CH2CHO). This also has two carbons and a carbonyl (aldehyde) group. The resulting compound would be a **halophenylacetaldehyde**. The total formula is C8H7XO.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the 1H NMR data options to determine the substitution pattern and identify the correct structure.**\n    *   The splitting patterns in the aromatic region (around 7-8 ppm) give clues about the substitution pattern (ortho, meta, or para). A pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons (2H), is highly characteristic of a **para (1,4) substitution**. This symmetrical arrangement results in two distinct sets of equivalent protons on the ring. Both options A and D show this `(2H, d), (2H, d)` pattern, suggesting a para-substituted compound. Options B and C can be eliminated as they do not show appropriate signals for a di-substituted benzene ring.\n\n*   **Step 4: Evaluate the remaining options (A and D) against the proposed structures.**\n\n    *   **Analyze Option D: 1H NMR: δ 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   `δ 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`: As identified, this fits a para-substituted benzene ring.\n        *   `δ 2.3 (3H, s)`: This signal is characteristic of a methyl group (-CH3) attached to a carbonyl, i.e., an **acetyl group (-COCH3)**. The chemical shift (around 2.1-2.5 ppm) is typical for this group. It is a singlet (s) because the adjacent carbonyl carbon has no protons, so there is no splitting.\n        *   **Conclusion for D**: This spectrum perfectly matches the structure of a **p-haloacetophenone** (e.g., 4-bromoacetophenone). This structure satisfies all the initial conditions: C8 total atoms, di-substituted aromatic, carbonyl group, and an Ar-X bond. The number of protons (2+2+3 = 7H) also matches the structure C6H4(COCH3)X. This is a very strong candidate.\n\n    *   **Analyze Option A: 1H NMR: δ 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   `δ 9.9 (1H, s)`: A signal in the 9-10 ppm range is characteristic of an **aldehyde proton (-CHO)**.\n        *   `δ 3.7 (2H, s)`: A signal around 3.7 ppm could correspond to a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to the aromatic ring and the carbonyl group.\n        *   **Conclusion for A**: This spectrum would correspond to a **p-halophenylacetaldehyde** structure (X-C6H4-CH2CHO). This structure also has C8, is di-substituted, has a carbonyl, and an Ar-X bond.\n        *   **Identifying the Flaw**: In a -CH2CHO group, the aldehyde proton is adjacent to the two methylene protons, and vice-versa. Due to spin-spin coupling, the aldehyde signal (-CHO) should be split by the -CH2- group into a **triplet (t)**, and the methylene signal (-CH2-) should be split by the -CHO proton into a **doublet (d)**. Option A incorrectly lists both of these signals as **singlets (s)**.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Information to Identify the Compound's Structure:**\n    *   **Structure:** The compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring,\" which means it's a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two groups attached.\n    *   **Carbon Count:** There are 8 total carbon atoms. Since the ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents must have a combined total of 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):** The compound contains a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (a halogen is attached directly to the ring).\n\n2.  **Assemble the Structure:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X), which contains zero carbons.\n    *   The other substituent must contain both of the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group. The most common and stable chemical group fitting this description is an **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n    *   Therefore, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**, with the general structure X-C₆H₄-COCH₃. This structure satisfies all given conditions. The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO, which means it has a total of 7 protons (4 on the aromatic ring, 3 on the methyl group).\n\n3.  **Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The substituents can be in an *ortho*, *meta*, or *para* arrangement. A highly symmetric structure like the *para* isomer gives a very distinct and simple NMR spectrum. Let's analyze the spectrum expected for *para*-haloacetophenone.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (4H):** The symmetry of the para-isomer creates two sets of equivalent protons on the ring. The two protons next to the acetyl group are equivalent, and the two protons next to the halogen are equivalent. These two sets of protons split each other, resulting in a characteristic pattern of **two doublets (d)**, each integrating to **2H**. The chemical shifts will be downfield (e.g., > 7.0 ppm) due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the substituents.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (3H):** The methyl group (-COCH₃) has three equivalent protons. They are not adjacent to any other protons, so they will appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. The typical chemical shift for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl is around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n    *   **Summary of Prediction:** We expect to see two doublets in the aromatic region (total 4H) and one singlet in the alkyl region (3H).\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Given Options:**\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: δ 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s):** These signals are not in the typical chemical shift range for aromatic protons (6.5-8.5 ppm). This is incorrect.\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: δ 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s):** The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde (-CHO), not a ketone. Additionally, the aldehyde and adjacent methylene protons would split each other into a triplet and a doublet, respectively, not the singlets shown here. This is incorrect.\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: δ 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s):** This spectrum perfectly matches our prediction for *para*-haloacetophenone. It has two doublets in the aromatic region, each for 2H, and a 3H singlet at 2.3 ppm for the acetyl group's methyl protons. This is the correct answer.\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: δ 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s):** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons, not the single one shown here. This is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll the information points to the structure being a para-haloacetophenone. The ¹H NMR data in option C is a perfect textbook match for this structure.\n\n<<<C>>>"

Deconstruct the Information Provided**\n\n*   **Structure:** A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This is a benzene ring with two groups attached (C6H4XY).\n*   **Molecular Formula:** The compound has 8 carbon atoms in total. Since the benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, the two substituents (X and Y) must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **FTIR Data:**\n    *   A peak for a carbonyl group (C=O) is present.\n    *   A peak for an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X) is present.\n\n**2. Deduce the Possible Chemical Structure**\n\n*   From the FTIR data, we know one substituent (let's say X) is a halogen atom (-F, -Cl, -Br, or -I). Halogens do not contain carbon.\n*   Therefore, the other substituent (Y) must contain both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n*   Let's consider possible C2 substituents containing a carbonyl group:\n    *   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** This has 2 carbons and a C=O. If this group is attached to the halo-benzene ring, the structure would be **halo-acetophenone** (C6H4(X)(COCH3)). This structure fits all the criteria: 8 carbons (6+2), di-substituted aromatic ring, a carbonyl group, and an aromatic-halogen bond.\n    *   **Formylmethyl group (-CH2CHO):** This also has 2 carbons and a C=O. The structure would be **halo-phenylacetaldehyde** (C6H4(X)(CH2CHO)). This structure also fits all the criteria.\n    *   Other groups like carboxymethyl (-CH2COOH) or methoxycarbonyl (-COOCH3) would also fit the carbon count and functional group requirement, but we will see that their expected NMR spectra do not match any of the options.\n\n**3. Analyze the 1H NMR Options**\n\nThe key to solving the problem is to match the predicted 1H NMR spectrum of our candidate structures with the given options. A di-substituted benzene ring will have 4 aromatic protons.\n\n*   **Option A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum shows no signals in the typical aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm). It cannot be the correct answer.\n\n*   **Option C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum shows only one aromatic proton (1H, s), which would suggest a tetra-substituted ring, contradicting the \"di-substituted\" information. It cannot be the correct answer.\n\n*   **Option B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`. This pattern of two doublets, each for 2 protons, is highly characteristic of a **para (1,4)-substituted** benzene ring. The chemical shifts, being far downfield (>7.5 ppm), indicate that both substituents are electron-withdrawing.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** `2.3 (3H, s)`. A singlet integrating to 3 protons in this region (~2.1-2.6 ppm) is the classic signal for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl (**-COCH3**).\n    *   **Matching Structure:** This spectrum perfectly matches the description of **p-halo-acetophenone**. The acetyl group (-COCH3) and the halogen (-X) are both electron-withdrawing and are in a para arrangement. The total proton count is 4 (aromatic) + 3 (methyl) = 7H, which matches the integration (2H + 2H + 3H = 7H).\n\n*   **Option D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Characteristic Peaks:** The signal at `9.9 (1H, s)` is unmistakably an **aldehyde proton** (-CHO). The signal at `3.7 (2H, s)` is consistent with a methylene group adjacent to both an aromatic ring and a carbonyl (-Ar-**CH2**-CHO).\n    *   **Matching Structure:** This data points towards the **p-halo-phenylacetaldehyde** structure.\n    *   **Inconsistency:** However, there is a major problem. The aromatic signals are at `7.8` and `7.6` ppm. For a phenylacetaldehyde, the electron-withdrawing aldehyde group is insulated from the ring by a CH2 group. Its effect on the ring is minimal. The aromatic protons should therefore appear much closer to the region for a simple halobenzene, around 7.2-7.4 ppm. The downfield shifts of 7.6-7.8 ppm are inconsistent with this structure. Such strong deshielding requires direct conjugation of the ring with an electron-withdrawing group like a carbonyl, as seen in acetophenone.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\n*   Option B describes the NMR spectrum of p-halo-acetophenone. All features of the spectrum (aromatic pattern, aromatic shifts, aliphatic signal) are consistent with this structure.\n*   Option D contains an internal contradiction: the aliphatic signals point to a phenylacetaldehyde structure, but the aromatic signals are in a region that is chemically incorrect for that structure.\n*   Therefore, the compound is a halo-acetophenone, and the correct 1H NMR data is given in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis question asks to identify the correct ¹H NMR data for a specific chemical compound. Let's break down the information given to deduce the structure of the compound and predict its NMR spectrum.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula and Basic Structure:**\n    *   The compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" This means we start with a benzene ring (C₆H₆) and replace two hydrogen atoms with two substituent groups. The core is C₆H₄.\n    *   The total number of carbon atoms is 8. Since the ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   The FTIR data confirms the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X, where X is a halogen like Cl, Br, or I).\n\n2.  **Determine the Substituents and Isomers:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen atom (-X), which contains no carbon atoms.\n    *   The other substituent must therefore contain both the carbonyl group and the two carbon atoms. The most common and stable chemical group fitting this description is an **acetyl group** (-COCH₃).\n    *   So, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. Its molecular formula is C₈H₇XO.\n    *   Since it is di-substituted, the halogen and the acetyl group can be arranged in three possible ways on the benzene ring: *ortho* (1,2-), *meta* (1,3-), or *para* (1,4-).\n\n3.  **Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Isomer:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (on the C₆H₄ ring):** There are 4 protons on the ring.\n        *   For *ortho* and *meta* isomers, the molecule is unsymmetrical. This would result in four distinct signals for the four aromatic protons, likely appearing as complex multiplets.\n        *   For the ***para* (1,4-) isomer**, the molecule is symmetrical. There are only two distinct types of aromatic protons. The two protons next to the acetyl group are equivalent, and the two protons next to the halogen are equivalent. This symmetry results in a very characteristic pattern: **two doublets**, each integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Substituent Protons (on the -COCH₃ group):**\n        *   The acetyl group has a methyl group (-CH₃). These three protons are equivalent and have no adjacent protons to couple with, so they will appear as a **singlet** integrating to **3H**. The chemical shift for a methyl group next to a carbonyl (a methyl ketone) is typically around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Given NMR Data Options:**\n\n    *   **A) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **Aromatic Region:** It shows two doublets at 7.8 and 7.6 ppm, each for 2 hydrogens. This is the classic signature of a **para-substituted** aromatic ring. The downfield chemical shifts (>7.5 ppm) are consistent with protons on a ring attached to two electron-withdrawing groups (both halogens and the acetyl group are deactivating/electron-withdrawing).\n        *   **Aliphatic Region:** It shows a singlet at 2.3 ppm for 3 hydrogens. This perfectly matches the signal for an acetyl methyl group.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This data is a perfect match for a **para-haloacetophenone**.\n\n    *   **B) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton, not a ketone. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   The integration in the aromatic region is incorrect. A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 protons, not 5 (1H + 2H + 2H). This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   There are no signals in the typical aromatic proton region (usually 6.5-8.5 ppm). This contradicts the fact that the compound has an aromatic ring. This option is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, option A is the only one that correctly describes the ¹H NMR spectrum for the compound deduced from the problem statement (a para-haloacetophenone).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Information from the Question:**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us we have a benzene ring (C6H4) with two substituent groups attached.\n    *   **\"8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring has 6 carbons, so the two substituents together must contain 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum...carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents must contain a C=O group.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum...aromatic-halogen bond\"**: One of the substituents is a halogen atom (-F, -Cl, -Br, or -I) directly attached to the aromatic ring. Let's denote this as -X.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure of the Substituents:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen, -X. This substituent contains 0 carbon atoms.\n    *   Therefore, the other substituent must contain both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n    *   Let's consider possible C2 groups that contain a carbonyl (C=O):\n        *   **Acetyl group (-COCH3)**: This has 2 carbons and a carbonyl group. This is a very common substituent.\n        *   **Formylmethyl group (-CH2CHO)**: This also has 2 carbons and a carbonyl group (in an aldehyde).\n        *   Other possibilities like a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or a carboxylic acid group (-CH2COOH) also fit the carbon count and carbonyl requirement.\n\n3.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data in the Options:**\n    *   Let's look for patterns. Options B and D both show a similar pattern in the aromatic region: `~7.8 (2H, d)` and `~7.6 (2H, d)`. This means there are two signals, each representing two equivalent protons, and each is a doublet. This is a classic, textbook pattern for a **para- (1,4) disubstituted** benzene ring. The symmetry of the para substitution makes the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to the two on the other.\n    *   Options A and C do not show signals in the typical aromatic proton chemical shift range (6.5-8.5 ppm), or the patterns do not match a disubstituted benzene ring. They can be eliminated.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Remaining Options (B and D) with Plausible Structures:**\n\n    *   **Candidate Structure 1: p-Haloacetophenone.**\n        *   This structure consists of a benzene ring with a halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH3) in a para arrangement.\n        *   It fits all initial criteria: di-substituted aromatic ring, 8 total carbons (6+2), carbonyl group, and aromatic-halogen bond.\n        *   **Predicted 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n            *   **Aromatic Protons:** Two doublets, each integrating to 2H, due to the para substitution. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carbonyl group will be further downfield. This matches the `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)` pattern.\n            *   **Aliphatic Protons:** A methyl group (-CH3) is attached to a carbonyl. It has no adjacent protons, so it will appear as a **singlet (s)**. It will integrate to **3H**. Its typical chemical shift is around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n        *   **Compare with Option D:** `1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)`. This is a **perfect match** for the predicted spectrum of p-haloacetophenone.\n\n    *   **Candidate Structure 2: (p-Halophenyl)acetaldehyde.**\n        *   This structure has a halogen (-X) and a formylmethyl group (-CH2CHO) in a para arrangement.\n        *   It also fits all initial criteria.\n        *   **Predicted 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n            *   **Aromatic Protons:** Two doublets, each for 2H. This matches the `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)` pattern.\n            *   **Aldehyde Proton (-CHO):** A very downfield signal, typically 9-10 ppm. It is adjacent to the -CH2- group, so it should be split into a **triplet (t)**. It would integrate to **1H**.\n            *   **Methylene Protons (-CH2-):** A signal deshielded by the ring and the carbonyl, typically ~3.5-4.0 ppm. It is adjacent to the -CHO proton, so it should be split into a **doublet (d)**. It would integrate to **2H**.\n        *   **Compare with Option B:** `1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)`. The chemical shifts are plausible for this structure. However, the splitting pattern is incorrect. Both the aldehyde and methylene protons are listed as **singlets (s)**, not the expected triplet and doublet. While small coupling constants can sometimes appear as singlets, this is less likely and makes the data a poorer fit than option D.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The 1H NMR data in option D is a textbook, unambiguous match for p-haloacetophenone, a structure that perfectly satisfies all the conditions given in the problem statement. The data in option B, while corresponding to another plausible structure, has a questionable splitting pattern. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Compound's Description:**\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This is a benzene ring (C6H4) with two substituents.\n*   **8 carbon atoms in total:** The benzene ring has 6 carbons, so the two substituents together must contain 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **FTIR - Carbonyl group:** The compound contains a C=O group.\n*   **FTIR - Aromatic-halogen bond:** A halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the aromatic ring.\n\n**2. Propose Candidate Structures:**\n\nBased on the information above, one substituent is a halogen (-X). The other substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group. Let's consider the possibilities for this second substituent:\n\n*   **An acetyl group:** -C(=O)CH3. This has two carbons and a carbonyl group. The resulting compound would be a **haloacetophenone**. The total carbon count is 6 (ring) + 2 (substituent) = 8. This is a strong candidate.\n*   **A formyl-methyl group:** -CH2CHO. This also has two carbons and a carbonyl group. The resulting compound would be a **(halophenyl)acetaldehyde**. The total carbon count is 6 (ring) + 2 (substituent) = 8. This is another strong candidate.\n\n**3. Analyze the 1H NMR Options:**\n\nLet's examine the provided NMR data to see which structure it supports. The options that show signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm) are A and C. Options B and D can be quickly eliminated.\n\n*   **Option B:** Has no signals in the aromatic region. This contradicts the presence of an aromatic ring.\n*   **Option D:** Shows only one aromatic proton (1H, s). A di-substituted benzene ring has four protons. This is incorrect.\n\nNow, let's analyze the plausible options, A and C. Both show a pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H (`7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`). This is a classic signature for **para (1,4) substitution** on a benzene ring, where the two substituents are different enough electronically to create an AA'BB' system that appears as two distinct doublets.\n\nSo, we are comparing **4-haloacetophenone** and **4-halo-phenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**4. Evaluate Option A vs. Option C:**\n\n*   **Option A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Structure Match:** This spectrum corresponds to **4-halo-phenylacetaldehyde**.\n        *   `9.9 (1H, s)`: This is the characteristic chemical shift for an **aldehyde proton** (-CHO).\n        *   `3.7 (2H, s)`: This is a typical shift for a **methylene group** (-CH2-) adjacent to both an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group.\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`: Aromatic protons.\n    *   **Consistency Check:** The group attached to the ring is -CH2CHO. The electron-withdrawing carbonyl group is insulated from the ring by a CH2 group. Therefore, the -CH2CHO group is only weakly deactivating. It would not shift the aromatic protons so far downfield to 7.6-7.8 ppm. The expected shifts would be much closer to those of toluene or ethylbenzene (around 7.1-7.3 ppm). For example, the protons of 4-chlorophenylacetaldehyde appear around 7.3 and 7.2 ppm. The aromatic shifts in this option are inconsistent with the proposed structure.\n\n*   **Option C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Structure Match:** This spectrum corresponds to **4-haloacetophenone**.\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This is in the region for a **methyl group** (-CH3). The singlet multiplicity indicates it's next to a quaternary carbon, like the carbonyl carbon in an acetyl group.\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`: Aromatic protons.\n    *   **Consistency Check:** The group attached to the ring is an acetyl group, -C(=O)CH3. The carbonyl is directly attached to the ring and is a strong electron-withdrawing group. This deshields the aromatic protons, especially those ortho to the acetyl group, pushing their chemical shifts significantly downfield. Shifts of 7.6-7.8 ppm are very characteristic for this type of structure. For example, 4-bromoacetophenone shows peaks at 7.82 and 7.61 ppm. The aromatic data is a very good fit. The methyl group shift at 2.3 ppm is slightly more upfield than the typical ~2.6 ppm for acetophenones, but this is a much smaller and more plausible discrepancy than the large error in the aromatic shifts in Option A.\n\n**5. Conclusion:**\n\nThe chemical shifts of aromatic protons are a strong indicator of the electronic nature of the substituents. The downfield shifts of 7.8 and 7.6 ppm strongly support the presence of a powerful, directly attached electron-withdrawing group like the acetyl group in 4-haloacetophenone. The data in Option A is inconsistent with the electronic effects of a -CH2CHO group. Therefore, Option C is the best match for the described compound.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Molecular Information:**\n*   **Core Structure:** A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, which is a benzene ring (C6H4) with two groups attached.\n*   **Total Carbon Atoms:** 8. Since the benzene ring itself has 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbons (8 - 6 = 2).\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):**\n    *   A carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   An aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X), meaning a halogen (like F, Cl, Br, I) is directly attached to the benzene ring.\n\n**2. Deduce the Molecular Structure:**\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X). This substituent has 0 carbon atoms.\n*   Therefore, the other substituent must contain both of the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group.\n*   Let's consider possible structures for a two-carbon substituent containing a C=O group:\n    *   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** This fits perfectly. It has 2 carbons and a carbonyl group. The resulting molecule would be a halo-acetophenone (X-C6H4-COCH3).\n    *   **Phenylacetaldehyde derivative (-CH2CHO):** This also fits. The substituent -CH2CHO has 2 carbons and a carbonyl group. The resulting molecule would be a halo-phenylacetaldehyde (X-C6H4-CH2CHO).\n*   Both `X-C6H4-COCH3` and `X-C6H4-CH2CHO` are valid structures based on the initial description. Both have 8 carbons, a di-substituted ring, a carbonyl, and an aromatic-halogen bond. The molecular formula for both would be C8H7XO, meaning they have 7 protons.\n\n**3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectra for the Possible Structures:**\nThe options present spectra with two doublets in the aromatic region, which is characteristic of a **1,4- (para) substitution pattern**. So we will assume para-substitution for our analysis.\n\n*   **Case 1: para-halo-acetophenone (p-X-C6H4-COCH3)**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (4H):** The benzene ring has two types of protons. The two protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group will be strongly deshielded. The two protons ortho to the halogen will also be deshielded, but typically less so. We expect two doublets in the region of **~7.4-8.0 ppm**.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (3H):** The methyl group (-CH3) is attached to a carbonyl. This deshields the protons. We expect a singlet (no adjacent protons) around **~2.3-2.6 ppm**.\n    *   **Total Protons:** 4H (aromatic) + 3H (methyl) = 7H.\n\n*   **Case 2: para-halo-phenylacetaldehyde (p-X-C6H4-CH2CHO)**\n    *   **Aldehyde Proton (1H):** The aldehyde proton (-CHO) is highly deshielded. We expect a singlet around **~9.5-10.0 ppm**.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (4H):** The -CH2CHO group is less electron-withdrawing than a directly attached carbonyl. The aromatic protons would be less deshielded than in Case 1. We expect two doublets in the region of **~7.1-7.4 ppm**.\n    *   **Methylene Protons (2H):** The benzylic methylene protons (-CH2-) are deshielded by both the ring and the adjacent carbonyl. We expect a singlet around **~3.6-3.8 ppm**.\n    *   **Total Protons:** 1H (aldehyde) + 4H (aromatic) + 2H (methylene) = 7H.\n\n**4. Analyze the Given Options:**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   Incorrect. It lacks signals in the typical aromatic region (7-8 ppm).\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum appears to describe the phenylacetaldehyde structure (Case 2), with the aldehyde (9.9 ppm) and methylene (3.7 ppm) protons matching well. However, the aromatic shifts (7.8 and 7.6 ppm) are too high (too deshielded). They are characteristic of a ketone directly attached to the ring (Case 1), not a phenylacetaldehyde. This option contains an internal inconsistency.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum is a perfect match for our prediction for para-halo-acetophenone (Case 1).\n    *   **7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, consistent with a para-substituted ring bearing a strong electron-withdrawing group. Total integration is 4H.\n    *   **2.3 (3H, s):** A singlet in the correct region for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl. Integration is 3H.\n    *   Total integration is 7H. This is a chemically consistent and accurate spectrum for the structure.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   Incorrect. A di-substituted benzene ring should have 4 aromatic protons, not 1. The integrations are also inconsistent with any likely structure.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe NMR data in option C perfectly matches the predicted spectrum for a para-halo-acetophenone, which is a valid structure derived from the problem description. The data in option B, while appearing plausible at first glance, contains chemically inconsistent chemical shifts for the aromatic protons. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Molecular Information:**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This indicates a benzene ring (C6H4) with two substituents, let's call them X and Y.\n    *   **\"8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring itself contains 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents (X and Y) must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum ... carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents must contain a C=O group.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum ... aromatic-halogen bond\"**: One of the substituents is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly attached to the aromatic ring. Let's say this is substituent X.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure of the Substituents:**\n    *   Substituent X is a halogen (-X). It contains 0 carbon atoms.\n    *   Substituent Y must therefore contain both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n    *   A functional group with 2 carbons and a carbonyl group is an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n    *   Therefore, the two substituents are a halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n\n3.  **Assemble the Final Structure:**\n    *   The compound is a haloacetophenone, with the general structure X-C6H4-COCH3. The total carbon count is 6 (ring) + 2 (acetyl) = 8. This matches all the given information.\n\n4.  **Analyze Potential Isomers and their Expected 1H NMR:**\n    *   The two substituents can be in the ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4) positions.\n    *   **Ortho and Meta Isomers**: These isomers lack symmetry. They would show four distinct signals in the aromatic region (between ~7.0-8.0 ppm), each integrating to 1H, with complex splitting patterns (doublets, triplets, doublet of doublets, etc.).\n    *   **Para Isomer (1,4-disubstitution)**: This isomer has a plane of symmetry passing through the two substituents. This symmetry makes the two protons ortho to the acetyl group equivalent to each other, and the two protons ortho to the halogen group equivalent to each other.\n        *   This results in a simpler aromatic spectrum: two signals, each a doublet, and each integrating to 2H.\n        *   The acetyl group is strongly electron-withdrawing, so the protons ortho to it will be more deshielded (further downfield, higher ppm value).\n        *   The methyl group (-CH3) of the acetyl substituent is not adjacent to any protons, so it will appear as a singlet, integrating to 3H. Its chemical shift is typically around 2.5-2.6 ppm.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Given 1H NMR Options:**\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: ... 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The peak at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a ketone. This contradicts our deduced structure of an acetophenone. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: ... 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **Aromatic region**: 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d). This is the classic A2B2 pattern for a para (1,4)-disubstituted benzene ring. It matches our predicted pattern for the para-isomer.\n        *   **Aliphatic region**: 2.3 (3H, s). This is a singlet integrating to 3 protons, which is exactly what we expect for the methyl group of the acetyl substituent.\n        *   While the chemical shift of 2.3 ppm is slightly lower than the typical ~2.6 ppm for an acetyl methyl, the overall pattern (two 2H doublets and one 3H singlet) is a perfect match for 4-haloacetophenone. The minor shift variation is acceptable. This option is a very strong candidate.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: ... 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum lacks any signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm). This cannot be the correct spectrum for an aromatic compound. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: ... 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   This shows only a single proton in the aromatic region, which is inconsistent with a di-substituted benzene ring (which must have 4 aromatic protons). This option is incorrect.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    Based on the analysis, the structure must be a haloacetophenone. Only Option B provides a spectrum that matches the signal pattern (multiplicity and integration) expected for such a compound, specifically the para-isomer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Molecular Formula and Functional Groups from the Clues:**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us the core of the molecule is a benzene ring (C6H4) with two substituent groups attached.\n*   **\"8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents together must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"FTIR ... carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents must contain a C=O functional group.\n*   **\"FTIR ... aromatic-halogen bond\"**: This means one substituent is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) bonded directly to the aromatic ring. Let's denote it as '-X'.\n\n**2. Assemble the Molecular Structure:**\n\n*   We have two substituents on a benzene ring.\n*   One substituent is a halogen, -X. This substituent contains 0 carbon atoms.\n*   The other substituent must therefore contain both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms AND the carbonyl group.\n*   Let's consider possible structures for a 2-carbon substituent containing a carbonyl group:\n    *   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** This has 2 carbons and a C=O. This is a very common substituent.\n    *   **Carboxylic acid group (-CH2COOH):** This has 2 carbons and a C=O, but would also have a very characteristic broad singlet for the acidic -OH proton, typically above 10 ppm. None of the options show this.\n    *   **Acetaldehyde group (-CH2CHO):** This has 2 carbons and a C=O (aldehyde). This is also a possibility.\n\n*   Let's evaluate the two most likely structures:\n    *   **Structure 1: Halo-acetophenone.** A halogen and an acetyl group on a benzene ring. The formula would be X-C6H5-COCH3. This has 6 (ring) + 2 (acetyl) = 8 carbons. It fits all the criteria.\n    *   **Structure 2: (Halo-phenyl)acetaldehyde.** A halogen and a -CH2CHO group on a benzene ring. The formula is X-C6H5-CH2CHO. This has 6 (ring) + 2 (substituent) = 8 carbons. It also fits all the criteria.\n\n**3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Potential Structure and Compare with Options:**\n\nTo have a simple, clean NMR spectrum with doublets in the aromatic region, the most likely substitution pattern is **para (1,4)**. This symmetry results in only two types of aromatic protons.\n\n*   **Prediction for para-halo-acetophenone (Structure 1):**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (C6H4):** In a para-substituted ring, there are two sets of equivalent protons. We expect two signals, each integrating to 2H. Due to coupling with their ortho neighbors, each signal should be a **doublet (d)**. The protons next to the electron-withdrawing carbonyl group will be shifted further downfield (higher ppm) than those next to the halogen. So we expect: `~7.5-8.0 ppm (2H, d)` and `~7.4-7.8 ppm (2H, d)`.\n    *   **Acetyl Protons (-COCH3):** The three protons on the methyl group are equivalent and have no adjacent protons to couple with. We expect one signal, integrating to 3H, as a **singlet (s)**. The typical chemical shift for a methyl ketone is around **2.1-2.6 ppm**.\n    *   **Summary for Structure 1:** Two doublets in the aromatic region (each 2H) and one singlet in the alkyl region (3H).\n\n*   **Prediction for para-(halo-phenyl)acetaldehyde (Structure 2):**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (C6H4):** Similar to above, we expect two **doublets (d)**, each integrating to 2H in the aromatic region (`~7.0-7.5 ppm`).\n    *   **Aldehyde Proton (-CHO):** The single proton of the aldehyde group is unique. It has a very characteristic chemical shift, typically **9.5-10.1 ppm**. It is adjacent to the -CH2- group, so it should be split into a **triplet (t)** by the two CH2 protons (n+1 rule, 2+1=3). We expect: `~9.7 ppm (1H, t)`.\n    *   **Methylene Protons (-CH2-):** The two protons of the methylene group are adjacent to the aldehyde proton. They will be split into a **doublet (d)** by the single aldehyde proton (n+1 rule, 1+1=2). The chemical shift would be around **3.5-4.0 ppm**. We expect: `~3.7 ppm (2H, d)`.\n    *   **Summary for Structure 2:** Two doublets (aromatic), one triplet (aldehyde), and one doublet (methylene).\n\n**4. Analyze the Given NMR Options:**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: ... 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**: The signals at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are not in the typical aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). This is incorrect.\n*   **B) 1H NMR: ... 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**: This option corresponds to Structure 2, the acetaldehyde derivative. It has the correct chemical shifts for the aldehyde proton (`9.9 ppm`), methylene protons (`3.7 ppm`), and aromatic protons (`7.8`, `7.6 ppm`). **However, the splitting is wrong.** The aldehyde proton should be a triplet, not a singlet, and the methylene protons should be a doublet, not a singlet, due to mutual coupling. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n*   **C) 1H NMR: ... 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**: Similar to A, the chemical shifts are not characteristic of an aromatic compound of this type. The integration and splitting are also unusual. This is incorrect.\n*   **D) 1H NMR: ... 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**: This data perfectly matches our prediction for **para-halo-acetophenone (Structure 1)**.\n    *   `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`: Two doublets in the aromatic region, each for 2H. This signifies a para-substituted ring.\n    *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: A singlet for 3H at a chemical shift characteristic of an acetyl methyl group.\n    \nAll aspects (chemical shifts, integration, and splitting) of this option are consistent with the proposed structure of para-halo-acetophenone, which fulfills all the conditions given in the problem statement.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Decode the Molecular Information from the Question:**\n\n*   **Structure:** A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This implies a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two substituents.\n*   **Total Carbons:** The molecule has 8 carbon atoms in total. Since the benzene ring itself has 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a combined total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **FTIR Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   A peak for a **carbonyl group (C=O)** is present.\n    *   A peak for an **aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X)** is present. This means one of the substituents is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) attached directly to the aromatic ring.\n\n**2. Propose Possible Structures:**\n\nBased on the information above, let's assemble the molecule:\n*   We have a halogen substituent (-X). Halogens do not contain carbon.\n*   Therefore, the other substituent must contain both the carbonyl group and the two required carbon atoms.\n*   A very common chemical group that fits this description is the **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**. It has two carbons and a carbonyl group.\n\nCombining these pieces, the most likely structure is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula would be C₈H₇XO.\n*   Total Carbons: 6 (ring) + 2 (acetyl) = 8. (Correct)\n*   Substituents: A halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH₃). It is di-substituted. (Correct)\n*   Functional Groups: It has an aromatic-halogen bond and a carbonyl group. (Correct)\n*   Total Protons: The benzene ring has 4 protons (C₆H₄), and the methyl group has 3 protons (-CH₃). The total is 4 + 3 = 7 protons.\n\nAnother possibility could be a (halophenyl)acetaldehyde (X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO). This also has 8 carbons, a carbonyl, and an Ar-X bond. We will evaluate the NMR data for both possibilities.\n\n**3. Analyze the 1H NMR Options:**\n\nThe correct 1H NMR spectrum must account for 7 protons and match the expected chemical shifts and splitting patterns for our proposed structure(s). Aromatic protons typically appear in the δ 6.5-8.5 ppm range.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: δ 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Integration:** 1+2+2+2 = 7 protons. This matches.\n    *   **Analysis:** The chemical shifts at δ 4.6 and 4.8 ppm are too low (upfield) for aromatic protons. Only one aromatic proton (1H) is listed. This is inconsistent with a di-substituted benzene ring which must have 4 aromatic protons. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: δ 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Integration:** 2+2+3 = 7 protons. This matches.\n    *   **Analysis:** This spectrum has no signals in the typical aromatic region (δ 6.5-8.5 ppm). The signals at δ 4.6-4.8 are not characteristic of aromatic protons. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: δ 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   **Integration:** 1+2+2+2 = 7 protons. This matches.\n    *   **Analysis:** This spectrum corresponds to the (halophenyl)acetaldehyde structure (X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO).\n        *   `δ 9.9 (1H, s)`: Correct region for an aldehyde proton (-CHO).\n        *   `δ 7.8 (2H, d)` & `δ 7.6 (2H, d)`: A pattern of two doublets (each 2H) is characteristic of a **1,4- (para) substituted** benzene ring.\n        *   `δ 3.7 (2H, s)`: Plausible region for the methylene protons (-CH₂-).\n        *   **Splitting Error:** However, in the structure X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO, the methylene (-CH₂) protons are adjacent to the aldehyde (-CHO) proton. Due to spin-spin coupling, they must split each other's signals. The -CH₂- signal should be a **doublet**, and the -CHO signal should be a **triplet**. The data incorrectly lists them both as **singlets (s)**. Therefore, this option is chemically incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: δ 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Integration:** 2+2+3 = 7 protons. This matches.\n    *   **Analysis:** This spectrum is a perfect match for a **para-haloacetophenone (p-X-C₆H₄-COCH₃)**.\n        *   `δ 7.8 (2H, d)` & `δ 7.6 (2H, d)`: This is the classic pattern for a **para-disubstituted** benzene ring. The acetyl group is strongly electron-withdrawing, shifting these protons downfield into the correct range.\n        *   `δ 2.3 (3H, s)`: This is the characteristic signal for an acetyl methyl group (-COCH**₃**). It is a **singlet (s)** because it is not adjacent to any other protons. The chemical shift around δ 2.3-2.6 ppm is expected.\n\n**4. Conclusion:**\n\nThe data in option D perfectly matches the predicted 1H NMR spectrum for para-haloacetophenone, a molecule that satisfies all the conditions given in the problem statement. The data in option C contains an error in the splitting pattern that makes it inconsistent with its corresponding structure.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the given information to determine the compound's structure.**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us the core structure is a benzene ring with two substituent groups attached. A benzene ring itself has the formula C6H6. When di-substituted, it's C6H4R1R2.\n    *   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents together must contain 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum...indicate the presence of a carbonyl group\"**: This means there is a C=O group in one of the substituents.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum...indicate the presence of an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: This means one of the substituents is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly attached to the benzene ring. Let's call this substituent -X.\n\n2.  **Assemble the molecular structure.**\n    *   We have one halogen substituent (-X), which contains 0 carbon atoms.\n    *   The other substituent must therefore contain both the carbonyl group (C=O) and the 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   The most common and stable functional group that fits this description is the **acetyl group** (-COCH3). It has exactly 2 carbons and a carbonyl group.\n    *   So, the compound is an **acetophenone** molecule with a halogen substituent on the ring. The general structure is **haloacetophenone**.\n    *   The molecular formula would be C8H7XO. This gives a total of 7 protons (4 on the aromatic ring and 3 on the methyl group), which we should see in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n3.  **Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for the proposed structure.**\n    *   The structure is a di-substituted benzene ring. The substitution can be *ortho* (1,2), *meta* (1,3), or *para* (1,4).\n    *   **The Acetyl Group (-COCH3)**: The three protons on the methyl group are equivalent and are adjacent to a carbonyl group but have no adjacent protons. They will appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. The typical chemical shift for a methyl ketone is around **2.1-2.6 ppm**.\n    *   **The Aromatic Protons (on the C6H4 ring)**: There are 4 protons on the ring.\n        *   If the substitution is *ortho* or *meta*, the molecule would be asymmetric. We would expect four distinct signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm), each integrating to 1H, with complex splitting patterns (e.g., doublets, triplets, doublets of doublets).\n        *   If the substitution is ***para***, the molecule has a plane of symmetry. This makes the two protons ortho to the acetyl group equivalent to each other, and the two protons ortho to the halogen equivalent to each other. This creates a classic AA'BB' system, which in many cases simplifies and appears as **two distinct doublets (d)**, each integrating to **2H**.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the given 1H NMR options against the prediction.**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This perfectly matches the signal for the acetyl methyl group (-COCH3).\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: This pattern of two doublets, each for 2H, is the characteristic signature of a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring.\n        *   The total integration is 3H + 2H + 2H = 7H, which is correct.\n        *   **This spectrum is a perfect match for a 4-haloacetophenone.**\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at `9.9 (1H, s)` is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a ketone. The compound identified is a ketone. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signals at `4.8` and `4.6 ppm` are not in the typical range for aromatic protons (which are usually > 6.5 ppm). This data does not represent an aromatic compound of the type we identified.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   Similar to option C, the chemical shifts `4.8` and `4.6 ppm` are incorrect for aromatic protons. The signal at `1.3 (3H, s)` is too upfield for a methyl ketone.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis, the compound must be a 4-haloacetophenone. Option A provides the exact 1H NMR data pattern expected for this structure: a singlet for the methyl group and a pair of doublets for the para-substituted aromatic ring.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Information from the Question:**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us we have a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two substituent groups attached. The substitution can be ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4).\n*   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring has 6 carbons. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms (8 - 6 = 2).\n*   **\"FTIR ... carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents contains a C=O group.\n*   **\"FTIR ... aromatic-halogen bond\"**: A halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I, let's denote it as -X) is directly attached to the aromatic ring. This is one of the two substituents.\n\n**2. Determine the Molecular Structure:**\n\n*   We have two substituents: a halogen (-X) and a group containing 2 carbons and a carbonyl group.\n*   Let's figure out the structure of the second substituent. It must have the formula C₂HᵧO.\n*   Possible structures for this C₂ substituent with a carbonyl group are:\n    *   **Acetyl group:** -C(=O)CH₃. This has 2 carbons and fits the description.\n    *   **Formylmethyl group:** -CH₂CHO. This also has 2 carbons and fits the description.\n*   Now, let's attach these possibilities to the halo-benzene ring.\n    *   **Structure I:** Halo-acetophenone (X-C₆H₄-C(=O)CH₃)\n    *   **Structure II:** Halo-phenylacetaldehyde (X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO)\n*   Both structures have a total of 8 carbons (6 from the ring, 2 from the side chain), a carbonyl group, and an aromatic-halogen bond. They both fit the initial description.\n\n**3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectra for the Possible Structures:**\n\nTo distinguish between the two possibilities and the different substitution patterns (ortho, meta, para), let's predict what their 1H NMR spectra would look like. We need a total of 7 protons (4 on the ring, 3 on the side chain for acetophenone; 4 on the ring, 3 on the side chain for phenylacetaldehyde).\n\n*   **Predicted Spectrum for Halo-acetophenone (Structure I):**\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-CH₃):** The three protons on the methyl group are adjacent to a carbonyl group, which has no protons. Therefore, they will appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. The typical chemical shift is around **2.0-2.6 ppm**.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** There are 4 protons on the ring.\n        *   If the substitution is **para (1,4)**, the molecule is symmetric. We will see two signals, each a **doublet (d)** and each integrating to **2H**. This is a very characteristic pattern. The chemical shift will be in the aromatic region, ~7.4-8.0 ppm, because the acetyl group is strongly electron-withdrawing.\n        *   If the substitution is ortho or meta, the pattern will be more complex, with four distinct signals for the 4 protons.\n\n*   **Predicted Spectrum for Halo-phenylacetaldehyde (Structure II):**\n    *   **Aldehyde Proton (-CHO):** This single proton is adjacent to the -CH₂- group. It will appear as a **triplet (t)**, integrating to **1H**. It is highly deshielded and will appear far downfield, typically **~9.5-10.0 ppm**.\n    *   **Methylene Protons (-CH₂-):** These two protons are adjacent to the aldehyde proton (-CHO). They will appear as a **doublet (d)**, integrating to **2H**. The typical chemical shift is around **3.5-4.0 ppm**.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** There are 4 protons. A **para** substitution would again give a pattern of two **doublets (d)**, each for **2H**. Because the electron-withdrawing carbonyl is not directly attached to the ring, the chemical shifts would be less downfield than for acetophenone, perhaps around ~7.1-7.5 ppm.\n\n**4. Compare Predicted Spectra with the Given Options:**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This option lacks any signals in the aromatic region (7-8 ppm). The signals at 4.6-4.8 ppm are too upfield. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum shows a signal at 9.9 ppm (aldehyde), two doublets in the aromatic region (para-substitution), and a signal at 3.7 ppm (methylene). This matches the functional groups of Structure II (halo-phenylacetaldehyde).\n    *   However, there are discrepancies: the aldehyde and methylene protons are shown as singlets (s), not a triplet and a doublet. Also, the aromatic protons are very far downfield (7.6-7.8 ppm), which is more typical for a group directly attached to the ring like in acetophenone.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This option does not show a clear pattern for either proposed structure. It has signals outside the aromatic region and an unusual integration and multiplicity. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **`7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`**: This is the classic, textbook pattern for a **para-substituted benzene ring**. It indicates 4 aromatic protons, split into two sets of 2.\n    *   **`2.3 (3H, s)`**: This is a perfect match for a **methyl group next to a carbonyl** (-C(=O)CH₃). A 3H singlet around 2.3 ppm is highly characteristic.\n    *   This spectrum perfectly matches our prediction for **para-halo-acetophenone (Structure I)**. Every detail (chemical shifts, integrations, multiplicities) is consistent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe data in option D provides a perfect match for p-halo-acetophenone. This molecule fits all the criteria given in the question: it is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, it has 8 carbon atoms, it contains a carbonyl group, and it has an aromatic-halogen bond. The NMR data is a textbook example for this structure. While the data in option B has some features of halo-phenylacetaldehyde, it has significant inconsistencies in multiplicity and chemical shift, making D the far better answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Decipher the Compound's Structure from the Description**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us the core of the molecule is a benzene ring with two groups attached to it. A benzene ring has 6 carbon atoms and, when di-substituted, 4 hydrogen atoms attached to the ring (C6H4).\n*   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum... indicate the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) as well as an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X)\"**: This tells us about the functional groups present. One substituent is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly attached to the aromatic ring. The other substituent must contain the two carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n\n**2. Assemble the Substituents**\n\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X).\n*   The other substituent must have the formula C2O. A very common and stable chemical group that fits this description is the acetyl group: -COCH3.\n*   Let's check other possibilities for a 2-carbon carbonyl-containing group. Another option is -CH2CHO.\n\n**3. Propose Candidate Structures**\n\n*   **Structure 1 (from -COCH3 substituent): Haloacetophenone.**\n    *   This compound consists of a benzene ring substituted with a halogen and an acetyl group.\n    *   Total carbons: 6 (ring) + 2 (acetyl) = 8. This matches.\n    *   It has the required functional groups (Ar-X, C=O).\n\n*   **Structure 2 (from -CH2CHO substituent): (Halophenyl)acetaldehyde.**\n    *   This compound consists of a benzene ring substituted with a halogen and a -CH2CHO group.\n    *   Total carbons: 6 (ring) + 2 (-CH2CHO) = 8. This also matches.\n    *   It has the required functional groups (Ar-X, C=O).\n\n**4. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Structure and Compare with Options**\n\nLet's analyze the expected signals for each structure. The substitution can be ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4). The provided options show a simple pattern (two doublets) in the aromatic region, which is highly characteristic of para (1,4) substitution. We will assume a para-substituted ring.\n\n*   **Prediction for para-Haloacetophenone (Structure 1)**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (C6H4)**: In a para-disubstituted ring, there are two sets of equivalent protons. This results in two signals, each appearing as a doublet due to splitting by the adjacent proton. Each doublet should integrate to 2H. The chemical shift will be in the aromatic region, typically 7.0-8.0 ppm.\n    *   **Acetyl Protons (-COCH3)**: The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent and have no adjacent protons. This will result in a singlet signal integrating to 3H. The chemical shift for a methyl group next to a carbonyl is typically 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n    *   **Summary Prediction:**\n        *   ~7-8 ppm (2H, d)\n        *   ~7-8 ppm (2H, d)\n        *   ~2.1-2.6 ppm (3H, s)\n\n*   **Prediction for para-(Halophenyl)acetaldehyde (Structure 2)**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (C6H4)**: Same as above, two doublets, each integrating to 2H, in the 7.0-8.0 ppm region.\n    *   **Aldehyde Proton (-CHO)**: The single proton of the aldehyde group is adjacent to the two CH2 protons. It should appear as a triplet. The chemical shift for an aldehyde proton is very distinct, typically 9.5-10.0 ppm.\n    *   **Methylene Protons (-CH2-)**: The two protons of the methylene group are adjacent to the single aldehyde proton. They should appear as a doublet. The chemical shift for protons on a carbon between a benzene ring and a carbonyl is typically 3.5-4.0 ppm.\n    *   **Summary Prediction:**\n        *   ~9.5-10.0 ppm (1H, t)\n        *   ~7-8 ppm (2H, d)\n        *   ~7-8 ppm (2H, d)\n        *   ~3.5-4.0 ppm (2H, d)\n\n**5. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   This matches the chemical shifts for the acetaldehyde structure (aldehyde H at 9.9, aromatic Hs at 7.8/7.6, methylene Hs at 3.7). However, the multiplicities are incorrect. The aldehyde proton should be a triplet (t), not a singlet (s), and the methylene protons should be a doublet (d), not a singlet (s). This option is incorrect due to the inconsistent splitting patterns.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum lacks signals in the typical aromatic proton region (7-8 ppm). It is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum shows two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2H, which is classic for a para-substituted ring.\n    *   It also shows a singlet integrating to 3H at 2.3 ppm, which is a perfect match for an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n    *   This data perfectly matches our prediction for para-haloacetophenone.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum also lacks signals in the aromatic proton region. It is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe 1H NMR data in option C is the only one that perfectly matches a molecule that satisfies all the conditions described in the problem. The molecule is a para-haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the given information:**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us the core of the molecule is a benzene ring with two groups attached to it (formula C₆H₄XY).\n    *   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring itself contains 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents (X and Y) must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum ... presence of a carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents must contain a C=O functional group.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum ... presence of an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: This means one of the substituents is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly attached to the aromatic ring. Let's designate this as -X.\n\n2.  **Determine the molecular structure:**\n    *   We have a halogen substituent (-X).\n    *   The other substituent must account for the remaining 2 carbon atoms and contain the carbonyl group.\n    *   The simplest and most common group that fits this description (2 carbons, one carbonyl) is the acetyl group, -COCH₃.\n    *   So, the compound is a haloacetophenone. The two substituents on the benzene ring are a halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH₃). The total carbon count is 6 (ring) + 2 (acetyl) = 8. This fits all the given criteria.\n\n3.  **Analyze the possible isomers and predict the 1H NMR spectrum:**\n    *   The two substituents can be arranged in three possible ways on the benzene ring: ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4).\n    *   Let's consider the symmetry of each isomer, as this greatly influences the 1H NMR spectrum:\n        *   **Ortho and Meta isomers**: These are asymmetrical. They would have four distinct signals for the four protons on the aromatic ring, likely resulting in a complex multiplet pattern.\n        *   **Para isomer**: This molecule has a plane of symmetry. This symmetry makes the two protons ortho to the acetyl group equivalent to each other, and the two protons ortho to the halogen equivalent to each other.\n    *   **Predicted spectrum for the para isomer (p-haloacetophenone):**\n        *   **Aromatic Region (6.5-8.5 ppm):** We expect two distinct signals for the aromatic protons.\n            *   One signal for the 2 protons next to the acetyl group.\n            *   One signal for the 2 protons next to the halogen.\n            *   Each signal will be a doublet because its protons are coupled to the other set of protons (ortho-coupling).\n            *   Therefore, the aromatic region should show two doublets, each integrating to 2H.\n        *   **Aliphatic Region:** We have the acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n            *   The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent and have no adjacent protons to couple with.\n            *   This will produce a singlet, integrating to 3H. The typical chemical shift for a methyl ketone (Ar-CO-CH₃) is around 2.2-2.6 ppm.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the given 1H NMR options:**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: This pattern of two doublets, each for 2 protons, in the aromatic region is the classic signature of a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This is a singlet for 3 protons, which perfectly corresponds to the methyl group of an acetyl substituent.\n        *   This option perfectly matches our predicted spectrum for p-haloacetophenone.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at `9.9 (1H, s)` is characteristic of an aldehyde proton, not a ketone. The rest of the signals do not fit a simple, logical structure consistent with the prompt.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   The chemical shifts `4.8` and `4.6` are not in the typical range for aromatic protons (6.5-8.5 ppm). This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   Again, the signals at `4.8` and `4.6` are not in the aromatic region. This option is incorrect.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The only 1H NMR data that is consistent with the deduced structure of p-haloacetophenone is Option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Structure from the Given Information:**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This indicates a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two substituents attached to it. The benzene ring itself accounts for 6 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: Since the benzene ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents together must contain 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of a carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents must contain a C=O group.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicate the presence of an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: This means a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the aromatic ring. This halogen atom is one of the two substituents.\n\nLet's assemble the structure:\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X).\n*   The other substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group. The simplest and most common chemical group that fits this description is an acetyl group (-COCH₃). This group contains a carbonyl (C=O) and two carbons.\n\nSo, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO.\n\n**2. Analyze the Possible Isomers and their Expected 1H NMR Spectra:**\n\nThe two substituents (-X and -COCH₃) can be arranged in three possible positions on the benzene ring: ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4).\n\n*   **Protons from the Acetyl Group:** The acetyl group (-COCH₃) has a methyl group. These 3 protons are not adjacent to any other protons, so they will always appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. The chemical shift for a methyl group next to a carbonyl (a methyl ketone) is typically around **2.0-2.6 ppm**.\n\n*   **Protons from the Aromatic Ring:** The benzene ring has 4 protons.\n    *   **Ortho (1,2) and Meta (1,3) Isomers:** In these arrangements, the molecule has low symmetry. The 4 aromatic protons would be chemically non-equivalent and would split each other, resulting in a complex pattern of multiplets (e.g., doublets, triplets, doublet of doublets) in the aromatic region of the spectrum (typically 6.5-8.0 ppm).\n    *   **Para (1,4) Isomer:** This isomer is highly symmetrical. There are only two types of aromatic protons due to a plane of symmetry passing through the two substituents.\n        *   The 2 protons ortho to the acetyl group are equivalent.\n        *   The 2 protons ortho to the halogen group are equivalent.\n        *   Each set of protons splits the other, so the aromatic region will show two distinct **doublets (d)**, each integrating to **2H**.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Given 1H NMR Options:**\n\nNow, let's compare the predicted spectra with the choices provided:\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The peak at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a ketone.\n    *   The singlet at 3.7 ppm integrates to 2H, not 3H, which is inconsistent with an acetyl methyl group. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d):** This pattern perfectly matches the expected signal for the 4 aromatic protons of a para (1,4)-disubstituted benzene ring. The integration (2H+2H=4H) is correct.\n    *   **2.3 (3H, s):** This is a singlet for 3 protons at 2.3 ppm, which is exactly what we expect for the methyl protons of an acetyl group.\n    *   This option perfectly matches the predicted spectrum for **4-haloacetophenone**.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum lacks signals in the typical aromatic proton region (around 7-8 ppm). The chemical shifts and splitting patterns are inconsistent with a haloacetophenone. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   Similar to option C, this spectrum is missing the characteristic aromatic proton signals. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe structure that fits all the information provided is 4-haloacetophenone. The 1H NMR data in option B is the only one that corresponds to this structure.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n*   **Step 1: Deconstruct the information provided in the question.**\n    1.  **Molecular Formula information:** The compound has a total of 8 carbon atoms. It is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. The aromatic ring itself (benzene) accounts for 6 carbon atoms (C6). Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms (8 total C - 6 ring C = 2 C).\n    2.  **Functional Group information (from FTIR):**\n        *   A peak indicates a carbonyl group (C=O).\n        *   A peak indicates an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X, where X is a halogen like F, Cl, Br, or I).\n    3.  **Structural deductions:**\n        *   We have a benzene ring with two groups attached (di-substituted).\n        *   One substituent is a halogen atom (-X) directly attached to the ring.\n        *   The other substituent must contain the remaining atoms: 2 carbons and 1 oxygen, including a C=O group. The most plausible and common group that fits this description is an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n\n*   **Step 2: Propose the most likely structure.**\n    *   Combining the deductions from Step 1, the compound is a haloacetophenone. The molecular structure consists of a benzene ring substituted with one halogen atom and one acetyl group.\n    *   The molecular formula is C8H7XO. This fits all the initial criteria.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the 1H NMR spectral features based on the proposed structure.**\n    *   The structure is a di-substituted benzene ring. This means there are 4 protons on the aromatic ring. The substitution pattern (ortho, meta, or para) will determine the splitting pattern of these protons.\n    *   Let's examine the patterns in the options provided, specifically in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm).\n        *   Options B and C show a pattern of `(2H, d)` and `(2H, d)`. This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is highly characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The symmetry of the para isomer results in only two distinct types of aromatic protons, which split each other into doublets.\n    *   So, we can refine our proposed structure to be a **para-haloacetophenone**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Predict the complete 1H NMR spectrum for para-haloacetophenone and compare it with the given options.**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** There are two sets of equivalent protons.\n        1.  The two protons ortho (adjacent) to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group (-COCH3). These will be deshielded and appear further downfield.\n        2.  The two protons ortho to the halogen atom (-X).\n        *   These two sets split each other, giving two doublets. The integration will be 2H for each doublet. Their chemical shift will be in the range of ~7.5-8.0 ppm.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There is one methyl group (-CH3) from the acetyl substituent.\n        *   These three protons are equivalent.\n        *   They are attached to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons on it, so they will appear as a **singlet** (no splitting).\n        *   The integration will be 3H.\n        *   The typical chemical shift for a methyl ketone (Ar-CO-CH3) is around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:** ~7.5-8.0 ppm (4H total, split into two doublets of 2H each) and ~2.1-2.6 ppm (3H, singlet).\n\n*   **Step 5: Match the predicted spectrum with the options.**\n    *   A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)\n        *   Incorrect. The chemical shifts are not in the aromatic region.\n    *   B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)\n        *   Incorrect. The peak at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde, not a ketone. This would correspond to a different structure, and the multiplicities are inconsistent for that structure anyway.\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **This is a perfect match.** It shows the two doublets for the 4 aromatic protons of a para-substituted ring (`7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`) and the singlet for the 3 methyl protons of the acetyl group at a characteristic chemical shift (`2.3 (3H, s)`).\n    *   D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)\n        *   Incorrect. The aromatic region is wrong (only 1H), and the other signals do not match.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n*   **Step 1: Deconstruct the problem statement to deduce the compound's structural features.**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This means we have a benzene ring (C6H4) with two substituents.\n    *   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring has 6 carbons, so the two substituents together must contain 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum... indicate the presence of a carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents contains a C=O group.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum... as well as an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: This means one substituent is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly attached to the benzene ring. Let's denote it as -X.\n\n*   **Step 2: Combine the structural features to propose candidate molecules.**\n    *   We have two substituents on a benzene ring: one is a halogen (-X), and the other must contain the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n    *   Let's figure out the C2 substituent with a carbonyl group. Two possibilities are most common:\n        1.  An **acetyl group** (-COCH3). This has two carbons and a carbonyl group. The resulting compound would be a **haloacetophenone**. The total formula is C8H7XO.\n        2.  A **(formylmethyl) group** (-CH2CHO). This also has two carbons and a carbonyl (aldehyde) group. The resulting compound would be a **halophenylacetaldehyde**. The total formula is C8H7XO.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the 1H NMR data options to determine the substitution pattern and identify the correct structure.**\n    *   The splitting patterns in the aromatic region (around 7-8 ppm) give clues about the substitution pattern (ortho, meta, or para). A pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons (2H), is highly characteristic of a **para (1,4) substitution**. This symmetrical arrangement results in two distinct sets of equivalent protons on the ring. Both options A and D show this `(2H, d), (2H, d)` pattern, suggesting a para-substituted compound. Options B and C can be eliminated as they do not show appropriate signals for a di-substituted benzene ring.\n\n*   **Step 4: Evaluate the remaining options (A and D) against the proposed structures.**\n\n    *   **Analyze Option D: 1H NMR: δ 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   `δ 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`: As identified, this fits a para-substituted benzene ring.\n        *   `δ 2.3 (3H, s)`: This signal is characteristic of a methyl group (-CH3) attached to a carbonyl, i.e., an **acetyl group (-COCH3)**. The chemical shift (around 2.1-2.5 ppm) is typical for this group. It is a singlet (s) because the adjacent carbonyl carbon has no protons, so there is no splitting.\n        *   **Conclusion for D**: This spectrum perfectly matches the structure of a **p-haloacetophenone** (e.g., 4-bromoacetophenone). This structure satisfies all the initial conditions: C8 total atoms, di-substituted aromatic, carbonyl group, and an Ar-X bond. The number of protons (2+2+3 = 7H) also matches the structure C6H4(COCH3)X. This is a very strong candidate.\n\n    *   **Analyze Option A: 1H NMR: δ 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   `δ 9.9 (1H, s)`: A signal in the 9-10 ppm range is characteristic of an **aldehyde proton (-CHO)**.\n        *   `δ 3.7 (2H, s)`: A signal around 3.7 ppm could correspond to a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to the aromatic ring and the carbonyl group.\n        *   **Conclusion for A**: This spectrum would correspond to a **p-halophenylacetaldehyde** structure (X-C6H4-CH2CHO). This structure also has C8, is di-substituted, has a carbonyl, and an Ar-X bond.\n        *   **Identifying the Flaw**: In a -CH2CHO group, the aldehyde proton is adjacent to the two methylene protons, and vice-versa. Due to spin-spin coupling, the aldehyde signal (-CHO) should be split by the -CH2- group into a **triplet (t)**, and the methylene signal (-CH2-) should be split by the -CHO proton into a **doublet (d)**. Option A incorrectly lists both of these signals as **singlets (s)**. This is chemically inconsistent.\n\n*   **Step 5: Final Decision**\n    *   Option D describes a chemically valid and consistent 1H NMR spectrum for p-haloacetophenone, a molecule that fits all the criteria given in the problem.\n    *   Option A describes a 1H NMR spectrum with incorrect splitting patterns for the proposed structure of p-halophenylacetaldehyde, making it an invalid representation.\n\nTherefore, the correct 1H NMR data is given in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
