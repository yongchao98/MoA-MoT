A compound is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature leading to chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters (chiral carbons). However, a molecule with stereocenters can still be achiral if it possesses an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion (such molecules are called meso compounds).\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`.\n    *   A stereocenter is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Let's examine the carbon atoms:\n        *   C1 is part of a double bond. Not a stereocenter.\n        *   C2 is part of a double bond. Not a stereocenter.\n        *   C3 (in the ethyl group) is a -CH2- group. Not a stereocenter.\n        *   C4 (in the ethyl group) is a -CH3 group. Not a stereocenter.\n        *   The methyl carbon attached to C2 is also not a stereocenter.\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers. The molecule is essentially planar about the double bond. A planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically inactive.**\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   The name itself provides the answer. The prefixes `(3aR,7aS)` specify the absolute configuration at two chiral centers (C-3a and C-7a).\n    *   When a compound is named as a specific, single enantiomer (using R/S notation), it is by definition chiral.\n    *   A pure sample of a single enantiomer will always be optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically active.**\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n    *   The configuration is given as (2R, 3S). We need to check for internal symmetry.\n    *   Let's draw a conformation (e.g., a Newman projection looking down the C2-C3 bond or a Fischer projection). In a staggered conformation, if we place the COOH groups anti-periplanar, the H on C2 is opposite the CH3 on C3, and the CH3 on C2 is opposite the H on C3. This conformation has a center of inversion. In an eclipsed conformation, the molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 bond.\n    *   A compound with stereocenters but which is achiral due to a plane of symmetry or center of inversion is a **meso compound**.\n    *   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is a classic example of a meso compound.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically inactive.**\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Its mirror image is (2S,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.\n    *   The (2R,3R) and (2S,3S) isomers are enantiomers. They are diastereomers of the meso (2R,3S) form.\n    *   Since (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, it lacks internal symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically active.**\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The name includes the `(R)` designation, which specifies a single enantiomer.\n    *   Let's verify the source of chirality. The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an -OH group at C1.\n    *   Carbon C1 is bonded to four different groups: (1) -OH, (2) -H, (3) the `-CH2-CH=` path around the ring, and (4) the `-CH2-CH2-CH=` path around the ring. These four groups are different.\n    *   Thus, C1 is a chiral center, and the molecule is chiral. The `(R)` specifies one of the two enantiomers.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically active.**\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl (-OH) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The `(1s,3s,5s)` notation (related to cis/trans) indicates that all three -OH groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   Let's consider the symmetry of this molecule. Imagine the cyclohexane ring is roughly planar. With all three -OH groups pointing up, the molecule has a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) perpendicular to the ring. It also has three planes of symmetry, each passing through one C-OH bond and the C4 atom across the ring.\n    *   The presence of these symmetry elements (especially the planes of symmetry) makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically inactive.**\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The IUPAC name describes a ketone. The parent chain is butan-1-one, where C1 is the carbonyl carbon. A cyclopentyl group is attached to C1, and a methyl group is at C3.\n    *   The structure is: `(Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3`. This can also be written as `(CH3)2CH-CH2-CO-(Cyclopentyl)`.\n    *   Let's search for chiral centers. A chiral center must have four different substituents.\n    *   The carbon `CH(CH3)2` is bonded to one H, two identical -CH3 groups, and a `-CH2-` group. It is not a chiral center.\n    *   No other carbon atom in the molecule is bonded to four different groups. The molecule does not have any stereocenters.\n    *   The molecule is flexible due to single bond rotation and lacks overall chirality. It can easily adopt conformations that possess a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion: Optically inactive.**\n\n**Summary:**\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-...dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive (meso)\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nCounting the optically active compounds, we have 3.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine if a compound will exhibit optical activity, we need to assess its chirality. A compound is optically active if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This usually occurs when the molecule lacks any improper axis of rotation, which includes a plane of symmetry (σ) and a center of inversion (i).\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   To be chiral, a molecule typically needs a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n    *   In this molecule, there are no chiral centers. C1 is part of a double bond. C2 is part of a double bond. C3 is a CH2 group. C4 is a CH3 group.\n    *   The molecule also lacks other types of chirality like axial or planar chirality.\n    *   It possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane of the double bond).\n    *   Therefore, it is **achiral** and optically **inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   The name itself specifies the absolute configuration at two stereocenters, `(3aR,7aS)`, and the geometry of a double bond `(E)`.\n    *   When a compound is named as a single, specific stereoisomer with R/S designators, it implies that the molecule is chiral and the name refers to a single enantiomer.\n    *   A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is, by definition, optically active. This complex bridged system is chiral.\n    *   Therefore, it is **chiral** and optically **active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n    *   This specific stereoisomer is `(2R,3S)`. Let's analyze its symmetry.\n    *   Molecules with multiple stereocenters can be achiral if they are meso compounds. A meso compound has an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion in at least one of its conformations, making it superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   For 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, the `(2R,3S)` isomer (which is identical to the `(2S,3R)` isomer) is a classic example of a meso compound. It possesses a center of inversion in its anti-staggered conformation and a plane of symmetry in an eclipsed conformation.\n    *   Since it is a meso compound, it is **achiral** and optically **inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.\n    *   Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` stereoisomer.\n    *   The `(2R,3R)` and `(2S,3S)` forms are non-superimposable mirror images of each other; they are a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   As a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, `(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid` is **chiral** and optically **active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond (between C3 and C4) and a hydroxyl group on C1.\n    *   The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: (1) -OH, (2) -H, (3) -CH2-CH=, and (4) =CH-CH2-CH2-. The paths around the ring are different, so C1 is a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer. A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is optically active.\n    *   Therefore, it is **chiral** and optically **active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   This name describes the all-cis isomer of 1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring's average plane.\n    *   Let's analyze the symmetry of its chair conformations. The all-cis arrangement corresponds to either all three -OH groups being axial (1a, 3a, 5a) or all three being equatorial (1e, 3e, 5e) after a ring flip.\n    *   The tri-equatorial conformer possesses a C3 rotational axis and three planes of symmetry (C3v point group). Each plane passes through one C-H axial bond and the opposite C-OH equatorial group.\n    *   The tri-axial conformer also has a C3 axis and three planes of symmetry.\n    *   Since the molecule possesses planes of symmetry in its stable conformations, it is **achiral** and optically **inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   The structure is `(Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   We check for any chiral centers. The carbon atom at position 3 of the butane chain, `CH(CH3)2`, is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a chiral center. No other carbon in the chain or the ring is a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule has no stereocenters and is flexible enough to adopt conformations with a plane of symmetry (e.g., the plane containing the C=O group).\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is **achiral** and optically **inactive**.\n\nSummary:\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive (meso)\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are 3 compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nAn optically active compound is a chiral molecule that can rotate the plane of polarized light. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Let's analyze each compound to determine its chirality and thus its potential for optical activity.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   To be chiral, a molecule must lack an internal plane of symmetry and a center of inversion.\n    *   This molecule has a double bond. The atoms connected to the double bond (Cl, H, C(CH3), C(CH2CH3)) lie in the same plane.\n    *   This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is achiral and **not optically active**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   The name of this compound includes stereochemical descriptors for absolute configuration: `(3aR, 7aS)`.\n    *   The designation of R and S configurations specifies a particular stereoisomer. When a specific enantiomer of a chiral molecule is named, it is by definition chiral.\n    *   A sample consisting of a single enantiomer is optically active.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   This molecule has two stereocenters, at C2 and C3.\n    *   The substituents on C2 (H, CH3, COOH, -CH(CH3)COOH) are identical to the substituents on C3.\n    *   The configuration is given as (2R, 3S), meaning the two stereocenters have opposite configurations.\n    *   A compound with multiple stereocenters that is achiral is called a meso compound. This typically occurs when the stereocenters have opposite configurations (one R, one S) and have identical sets of substituents.\n    *   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid has a center of inversion and is a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral.\n    *   Therefore, it is **not optically active**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the previous compound. It has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n    *   The configuration is (2R, 3R), meaning both stereocenters have the same configuration.\n    *   This molecule lacks any internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is chiral.\n    *   Its mirror image is the (2S, 3S) isomer, which is non-superimposable. These two form a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   Therefore, (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   The name specifies the absolute configuration `(R)` at one of the carbons (C1).\n    *   The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: -OH, -H, the `-CH2-CH=` part of the ring, and the `-CH=CH-CH2-` part of the ring. These two paths around the ring are different. Thus, C1 is a stereocenter.\n    *   The molecule is chiral. The name specifies a single enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   This name describes the all-cis isomer, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring.\n    *   This molecule is conformationally flexible. Its most stable conformations are two interconverting chairs. Both of these chair conformations are chiral (they belong to the C3 point group).\n    *   However, a molecule is considered achiral if it can easily access any achiral conformation. The process of ring-flipping in cyclohexane passes through higher-energy boat and twist-boat conformations. For the all-cis-1,3,5-triol, there exists an accessible boat conformation that possesses a plane of symmetry (a C_s point group).\n    *   Because the molecule can readily pass through an achiral conformation, the chiral conformers rapidly interconvert, resulting in a racemic mixture that cannot be resolved. Thus, the compound as a whole is considered achiral.\n    *   Therefore, it is **not optically active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   The structure is a cyclopentyl group attached to a carbonyl, which is then attached to an isobutyl group: `(C5H9)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   Let's check for stereocenters. There are none. All carbons are bonded to at least two identical groups (e.g., two H's on a CH2, or two CH3's on the CH).\n    *   The molecule is flexible due to single bond rotation. It is possible to find a conformation that has a plane of symmetry. This plane would contain the carbonyl group (C=O) and bisect both the cyclopentyl ring and the isobutyl group.\n    *   Since the molecule has no stereocenters and has accessible conformations with a plane of symmetry, it is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, it is **not optically active**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe compounds that will exhibit optical activity are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nA compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral and present in a non-racemic form. A molecule is chiral if it is not superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters. However, a molecule with stereocenters can be achiral if it is a meso compound (possessing an internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion). Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   The molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond. The atoms bonded to the sp2 carbons (Cl, H, C, C) lie in the same plane. The molecule is planar.\n    *   Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore achiral.\n    *   Thus, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   The name itself provides the key information. The descriptors `(3aR,7aS)` indicate the presence of specific stereocenters with a defined absolute configuration. The `(E)` describes the geometry of the exocyclic double bond.\n    *   This designates a single, specific stereoisomer. A specific stereoisomer is always optically active unless it happens to be a meso compound.\n    *   A meso compound must possess an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. The structure is complex and unsymmetrical, particularly due to the `(E)-chloromethylene` group (`=CHCl`). This substituent breaks any potential symmetry that the parent bicyclic framework might have.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is chiral and, as a specific stereoisomer, it is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n    *   The substituents on C2 are identical to the substituents on C3 (H, CH3, COOH, and the other chiral carbon group).\n    *   For a molecule with two identical stereocenters, the isomer with the (R,S) or (S,R) configuration is the meso form.\n    *   The meso form has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 bond. Because it is superimposable on its mirror image, it is achiral.\n    *   Thus, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. It is the (R,R) diastereomer.\n    *   This isomer does not have an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) isomer, and they are not superimposable.\n    *   The (2R,3R) and (2S,3S) isomers form an enantiomeric pair. As a single enantiomer is specified, it is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   This is a six-membered ring with a double bond (between C3 and C4) and an alcohol group (at C1).\n    *   The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: (1) -OH, (2) -H, (3) -CH2-CH=CH- (path towards C2), and (4) -CH2-CH2-CH= (path towards C6). The two paths around the ring are different due to the asymmetric position of the double bond relative to C1.\n    *   Therefore, C1 is a stereocenter. The name specifies the `(R)` configuration, meaning it is a single enantiomer. The molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   Thus, it is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This name describes the isomer where the three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5 are all on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all-cis).\n    *   Let's consider the chair conformation. The most stable conformation would have all three bulky -OH groups in equatorial positions. However, even the less stable tri-axial conformation can be considered.\n    *   In the tri-axial conformation, the molecule possesses a C3 axis of rotation and, more importantly, three vertical planes of symmetry (σv). Each plane passes through one C-OH bond and the CH2 group opposite to it.\n    *   The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral. Although the molecule has conformational isomers, the overall time-averaged molecule is achiral because the symmetric conformers are accessible.\n    *   Thus, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure is `(Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   We need to check for any stereocenters (a carbon with four different substituents).\n    *   The `CH(CH3)2` carbon is bonded to H, two identical methyl groups, and the rest of the molecule; it is not a stereocenter.\n    *   All other carbons are either sp2 hybridized (C=O) or are CH2 groups, so there are no stereocenters in the molecule.\n    *   The molecule also possesses a plane of symmetry in its most stable conformation (this plane contains the carbonyl group and bisects the cyclopentyl ring and the isobutyl group).\n    *   Since the molecule is achiral, it is **optically inactive**.\n\nSummary:\n*   **Active**: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   **Active**: (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   **Active**: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n*   **Inactive**: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\n*   **Inactive**: (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   **Inactive**: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol\n*   **Inactive**: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine its optical activity. A compound is optically active if it is chiral and present in a form that is not a racemic mixture.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** ClHC=C(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)\n    *   **Analysis:** This is an alkene. The atoms involved in the double bond (C1 and C2) and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane. The entire molecule is essentially planar. A molecule with a plane of symmetry (in this case, the molecular plane itself) is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex polycyclic molecule. The name itself provides crucial information.\n    *   **Analysis:** The stereochemical descriptors (3a**R**, 7a**S**, **E**) specify a single, unique stereoisomer. The presence of R/S descriptors indicates that there are chiral centers in the molecule. A specific enantiomer of a chiral compound is always optically active.

However, the molecule has a symmetric structure (the two ends are identical -COOH groups). The (2R, 3S) configuration results in a meso compound. A meso compound has stereocenters but is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.

It possesses a three-fold axis of rotation (C₃) and three planes of symmetry (σᵥ). For example, a plane of symmetry passes through the C1-O bond and the C4 atom.

A compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common structural feature leading to chirality is a stereocenter (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups). However, a molecule with stereocenters can be achiral if it possesses a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion; such compounds are called meso compounds. Conversely, some molecules without stereocenters can be chiral (e.g., allenes, atropisomers), but this is less common.\n\nWe will analyze each compound individually to determine its chirality.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`\n    *   **Analysis:** This is an alkene. The molecule is essentially planar. The plane of the molecule acts as a plane of symmetry. Therefore, the molecule is achiral and not optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex, polycyclic molecule with a rigid framework.\n    *   **Analysis:** The name includes stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. These `R` and `S` descriptors are used to define the absolute configuration at specific stereocenters. The presence of these descriptors in the name indicates that the molecule is chiral and that a specific, single enantiomer is being described. A single enantiomer is by definition optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule has two stereocenters (at C2 and C3). The substituents on C2 are the same as on C3 (H, CH3, COOH, and the other chiral carbon group). When a molecule has two identical stereocenters, the diastereomer with opposite configurations (`R,S` or `S,R`) is a meso compound. Meso compounds possess an internal plane of symmetry (in at least one conformation) or a center of inversion, making them achiral and optically inactive despite having stereocenters.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Inactive (meso compound).\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a diastereomer of the meso compound described above. The `(2R,3R)` configuration lacks any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule. Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` compound, and they are a pair of enantiomers. Since this compound is chiral, it is optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring containing a C=C double bond and an alcohol group.\n    *   **Analysis:** Carbon C1, bonded to the -OH group, is a stereocenter. The four groups attached to it are: -H, -OH, the path around the ring towards the double bond (-CH2-CH=), and the path around the ring away from the double bond (-CH2-CH2-CH=). These two paths are different. The molecule as a whole lacks any element of symmetry. The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer, which is a single chiral molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5, all on the same side of the ring (all `cis`).\n    *   **Analysis:** Although carbons C1, C3, and C5 are stereocenters, the molecule as a whole is highly symmetrical. It possesses a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and three planes of symmetry. Each plane of symmetry passes through one C-OH bond and the CH2 group on the opposite side of the ring. The presence of these planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** The most plausible structure based on IUPAC nomenclature is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. The parent chain is a butan-1-one, with the carbonyl as C1. A methyl group is on C3. A cyclopentyl group is on C1. This gives `(cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3`. Rechecking the numbering `C1(=O)-C2H2-C3H(CH3)-C4H3`. Yes, this is `3-methyl-butan-1-one`. The full name is `1-cyclopentyl-3-methyl-1-butanone`. The group is isobutyl, `(CH3)2CH-CH2-`. Let's build from the name again. `3-methylbutanoyl` is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-`. The ketone is cyclopentyl 3-methylbutanoyl ketone. So the structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`.\n    *   **Analysis:** Let's examine this structure for stereocenters.\n        *   The C3 of the chain is bonded to one H and two identical `CH3` groups, so it is not a stereocenter.\n        *   There are no other stereocenters in the chain or the cyclopentyl ring.\n        *   The molecule has no other sources of chirality like chiral axes or planes. Therefore, it is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Inactive.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nCounting the compounds that will exhibit optical activity, we have 3.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the optical activity of each compound. A compound is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters without any internal elements of symmetry (like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion).\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** ClHC=C(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃). This is an alkene.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is planar about the C=C double bond. This plane of the molecule acts as a plane of symmetry. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral. There are no stereocenters.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex polycyclic molecule. The name itself provides the key information.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The name specifies a single, distinct stereoisomer with the configurations (3aR, 7aS) at two stereocenters and (E) at a double bond. When a specific enantiomer (indicated by R/S descriptors) is named, it implies the compound is chiral and has been resolved from its mirror image. Such a complex structure is highly unlikely to possess the symmetry required to be a meso compound. A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is always optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH. This molecule has two stereocenters, at C2 and C3.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is symmetric, as the groups attached to C2 are identical to the groups attached to C3 (H, CH₃, COOH). We need to check if the (2R,3S) configuration leads to a meso compound. A meso compound has stereocenters but is achiral overall due to an internal element of symmetry. For a molecule with two equivalent stereocenters, the (R,S) isomer is a meso compound. This molecule has a center of inversion midway along the C2-C3 bond. A molecule with a center of inversion is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a meso compound. Optically **inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH. This is a diastereomer of the previous compound.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** Both stereocenters have the same configuration (R,R). This molecule lacks any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is chiral, and its mirror image is the (2S,3S) compound. A specific enantiomer of a chiral compound is optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring containing a double bond (between C3 and C4) and an alcohol group (at C1).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: (1) -OH, (2) -H, (3) the -CH=CH-CH₂- path around the ring, and (4) the -CH₂-CH₂-CH= path around the ring. These two paths are different, so C1 is a stereocenter. The molecule as a whole lacks any element of symmetry. The name specifies the (R) enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl (-OH) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The nomenclature `1s,3s,5s` indicates that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (all `cis`).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** This is a highly symmetric molecule. Although C1, C3, and C5 are stereocenters, the molecule possesses multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane passing through the C1-OH bond and the C4 atom acts as a mirror plane, reflecting C2 onto C6 and C3 onto C5. Since C3 and C5 have identical substituents in the same orientation, the molecule is symmetrical with respect to this plane. The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** (CH₃)₂CH-CH₂-C(=O)-(Cyclopentyl).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** We need to check for any stereocenters or overall molecular chirality. There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. The isobutyl group `((CH₃)₂CH-CH₂-)` is not chiral. The cyclopentyl ring attached to the carbonyl group is also not chiral, as the two paths around the ring from the point of attachment are identical. The molecule as a whole possesses a plane of symmetry that includes the carbonyl group and bisects both the isobutyl group and the cyclopentyl ring.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Inactive: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\n*   **Active**: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   Inactive: (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   **Active**: (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   **Active**: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n*   Inactive: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol\n*   Inactive: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one\n\nCounting the optically active compounds, we find there are 3.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity. A compound exhibits optical activity if and only if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is not superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of a stereocenter (a carbon atom with four different substituents), but the ultimate test is the absence of any plane of symmetry or center of inversion in the molecule.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** The molecule is an alkene. The atoms involved in the C=C double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane. The structure is:\n        ```\n           Cl   CH3\n            \\ /\n             C=C\n            / \\\n           H   CH2CH3\n        ```\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is planar. Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore achiral. It has no chiral centers.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is achiral and thus **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex, polycyclic molecule.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The name includes the stereochemical descriptors `(3aR, 7aS)`. These are Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (R/S) notations that describe the absolute configuration at two specific chiral centers (carbons 3a and 7a). The fact that a specific enantiomer is named indicates that the molecule is chiral. A single, specific enantiomer of a chiral compound is always optically active. This compound is not a meso compound because it lacks the necessary internal symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. It has two chiral centers at C2 and C3.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The two chiral centers are identically substituted (both are bonded to H, CH3, COOH, and the other chiral carbon group). For such molecules, three stereoisomers exist: a pair of enantiomers (R,R and S,S) and a meso form (R,S). The (R,S) stereoisomer has a plane of symmetry between the two carbon atoms. A compound with chiral centers but an internal plane of symmetry is a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a meso compound, which is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a different stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** This is the (R,R) isomer. It is the enantiomer of the (S,S) isomer and a diastereomer of the meso (R,S) form. The (R,R) isomer does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** As a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an OH group at C1.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The name includes the stereodescriptor `(R)`, indicating that a specific enantiomer is being described. Let's verify the chirality. The carbon C1 is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, the ring path -CH2-CH=CH- (C2-C3-C4), and the ring path -CH2-CH2-CH= (C6-C5-C4). Since these two paths around the ring are different, C1 is a chiral center. The molecule as a whole lacks any plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is chiral, and a single enantiomer `(R)` is specified, so it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with OH groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** Due to the symmetric 1,3,5-substitution pattern, the carbons C1, C3, and C5 are not chiral centers. For example, at C1, the path C1-C2-C3(OH)-C4-C5(OH)-C6 is identical to the path C1-C6-C5(OH)-C4-C3(OH)-C2. Thus, the two ring attachments to C1 are identical. The same applies to C3 and C5. Furthermore, any stereoisomer of this compound (e.g., all-cis or cis-trans) will possess at least one plane of symmetry. For instance, the all-`cis` isomer has three planes of symmetry. The notation (1s,3s,5s) is non-standard, but it cannot make an inherently achiral structure chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** (CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-(cyclopentyl ring)\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** We look for any chiral centers (sp3 carbons with four different substituents).\n        *   The cyclopentyl ring consists of -CH2- groups. No chiral center.\n        *   The carbonyl carbon is sp2. Not a chiral center.\n        *   The carbon C2 (-CH2-) is not a chiral center.\n        *   The carbon C3 is bonded to a H, the rest of the chain, and two identical methyl (-CH3) groups. Since it has two identical groups, it is not a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers and no other elements of chirality (like axial or planar chirality). It is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n*   **Active:** (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   **Active:** (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   **Active:** (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are **3** compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nAn optically active compound is a chiral compound. A compound is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This property is most often due to the presence of one or more chiral centers, but can also arise from other elements of chirality like axial or planar chirality. A compound is achiral (and thus optically inactive) if it possesses an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:**\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   There are no chiral centers (carbon atoms bonded to four different groups) in this molecule.\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry that contains the `C=C` double bond and all the atoms directly attached to it.

This indicates that the compound is a single, specific stereoisomer.\n    *   The presence of `R` and `S` descriptors signifies the absolute configuration at chiral centers. Since a specific enantiomer is named, the compound must be chiral. A pure sample of a single enantiomer is optically active.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:**\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two chiral centers at C2 and C3.\n    *   However, the molecule is symmetric, meaning the groups on C2 are the same as on C3 (H, CH3, COOH, and the other chiral carbon group).\n    *   In such cases, the diastereomer with opposite configurations at the two identical chiral centers (one R, one S) is called a *meso* compound.\n    *   A meso compound is achiral because it has an internal element of symmetry (in this case, a center of inversion when drawn appropriately) and is superimposable on its mirror image. Achiral compounds are not optically active.\n    *   Conclusion: **Not optically active**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:**\n    *   This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. The `(2R,3R)` configuration is diastereomeric to the meso `(2R,3S)` form.\n    *   The `(2R,3R)` isomer and its mirror image, the `(2S,3S)` isomer, are not superimposable on each other. They form an enantiomeric pair.\n    *   As a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, it is optically active.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:**\n    *   The name specifies a single enantiomer, the `(R)` isomer.\n    *   The carbon at position 1 is a chiral center.

The most common indicators of chirality are the presence of one or more stereocenters and the absence of any plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`\n    *   **Analysis:** This is an alkene. Let's check for chiral centers (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n        *   C1 and C2 are `sp2` hybridized and part of a double bond; they cannot be chiral centers.\n        *   The CH2 carbon (C3) is bonded to two identical hydrogen atoms. Not a chiral center.\n        *   The terminal CH3 carbon (C4) is bonded to three identical hydrogen atoms. Not a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers. Furthermore, the entire molecule is planar. A planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex bicyclic molecule, a derivative of a norbornane-type skeleton.\n    *   **Analysis:** The name itself provides the crucial information.\n        *   The stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)` indicate the presence of at least two stereocenters (at positions 3a and 7a) with a specific configuration.\n        *   A specific enantiomer is named. For a molecule to be named with specific `R` and `S` configurations for its stereocenters (and not be described as meso), it must be a chiral molecule.\n        *   Let's consider the possibility of it being a meso compound. The parent structure (without the C8 substituent) could potentially have a plane of symmetry. However, the substituent `8-(chloromethylene)` which is `=CHCl` is located on the methano bridge of the norbornane system. This substituent is asymmetric and breaks any potential plane of symmetry in the parent skeleton.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral, and a specific enantiomer is given. Therefore, it is optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule has two stereocenters, C2 and C3.\n        *   The substituents on C2 and C3 are identical: -H, -CH3, -COOH, and the other -CH(CH3)COOH group.\n        *   When a molecule has multiple stereocenters and the groups on these centers are identical, there is a possibility of a meso form.\n        *   The specified configuration is `(2R,3S)`. For a molecule like this, the isomer with opposite configurations (one R, one S) has a plane of symmetry between the two stereocenters.\n        *   Let's visualize the Fischer projection for the (2R,3S) isomer.\n            ```\n                  COOH\n                   |\n            CH3 -- C -- H   (R)\n                   |\n              H -- C -- CH3   (S)\n                   |\n                  COOH\n            ```\n            There is a plane of symmetry cutting horizontally between C2 and C3.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral due to internal symmetry, making them optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`\n    *   **Analysis:** This is another stereoisomer of the same molecule.\n        *   The configuration is `(2R,3R)`. This isomer does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer, and they are non-superimposable.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a chiral molecule. A sample consisting of a single enantiomer like `(2R,3R)` will be optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an alcohol group at C1.\n    *   **Analysis:** Let's check for stereocenters.\n        *   Carbon C1 is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, C2 (part of -CH=CH-), and C6 (part of -CH2-CH2-). Thus, C1 is a stereocenter.\n        *   A molecule with a single stereocenter is always chiral.\n        *   The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a chiral molecule, and a specific enantiomer is given. It is optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl (-OH) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   **Analysis:** The nomenclature `(1s,3s,5s)` is used to denote relative stereochemistry, typically meaning all three substituents are *cis* (on the same side of the ring).\n        *   Let's visualize the chair conformation. In the most stable conformation of the all-cis isomer, the three -OH groups can occupy the 1, 3, and 5 axial positions (all pointing \"up,\" for example).\n        *   This molecule, despite having stereocenters (C1, C3, C5), is highly symmetrical. It has a C3 axis of rotation and, more importantly, three planes of symmetry. Each plane passes through one C-OH bond and the opposite carbon atom (e.g., the plane containing C1, O1, and C4).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Due to the presence of planes of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** `Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`\n    *   **Analysis:** Let's search for any chiral elements.\n        *   **Chiral Centers:** There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. The -CH(CH3)2 group has two identical methyl groups, so the CH carbon is not chiral. All carbons in the cyclopentyl ring have at least two identical substituents (either two hydrogens or two identical paths around the ring from the point of attachment).\n        *   **Other sources of chirality:** The molecule is not an allene, spirane, or atropisomer. There is free rotation around the single bonds.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Compound                                                                        | Chiral?          | Optically Active? |\n| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :--------------- | :---------------- |\n| (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene                                                  | No (Achiral)     | No                |\n| (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione       | Yes (Chiral)     | Yes               |\n| (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid                                               | No (Meso)        | No                |\n| (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid                                               | Yes (Chiral)     | Yes               |\n| (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol                                                          | Yes (Chiral)     | Yes               |\n| (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol                                              | No (Achiral)     | No                |\n| 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one                                               | No (Achiral)     | No                |\n\nCounting the compounds that will exhibit optical activity, we have three:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nA compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable. The most common feature leading to chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters. However, a molecule with stereocenters can still be achiral if it possesses an element of symmetry, such as a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion (such molecules are called meso compounds). We will analyze each compound to determine if it is chiral.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `CH3-CH2-C(CH3)=CHCl`.\n    *   This molecule does not have any chiral centers (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry that is the plane containing the double bond atoms (C1, C2, Cl, H attached to C1, C3 and the first carbon of the ethyl group).\n    *   Since it is achiral, it is **not optically active**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   The name includes stereochemical descriptors `(3aR, 7aS)`. These R/S assignments specify a particular stereoisomer.\n    *   The presence of such specific descriptors indicates that the molecule has stereocenters and that we are considering a single, defined stereoisomer.\n    *   Unless this specific combination of R and S configurations results in a meso compound (which is highly unlikely for such a complex, unsymmetrical structure), the molecule is chiral. A single enantiomer is, by definition, chiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two stereocenters, at C2 and C3.\n    *   The substituents on C2 are the same as on C3 (-H, -CH3, -COOH). This suggests the possibility of a meso compound.\n    *   The (2R,3S) configuration refers to the meso form of this molecule. A meso compound has stereocenters but is achiral overall due to an internal element of symmetry.\n    *   Let's draw the molecule in a staggered conformation looking down the C2-C3 bond. The (2R, 3S) conformer can adopt a conformation with a center of inversion (a point of symmetry). It also has a conformation with a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Because it is a meso compound, it is achiral and **not optically active**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.\n    *   The (2R,3R) configuration and its mirror image, (2S,3S), are enantiomers. They are non-superimposable mirror images.\n    *   This molecule lacks any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   Thus, the (2R,3R) isomer is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond (between C3 and C4) and a hydroxyl group on C1.\n    *   The name specifies the `(R)` configuration at C1. C1 is a stereocenter because it is attached to four different groups: -H, -OH, -CH2-CH=, and -CH2-CH2-CH=.\n    *   The molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   Since the name describes a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This is cyclohexane with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5, all on the same side of the ring (cis).\n    *   Let's consider its chair conformation. With all OH groups in axial positions, the molecule has three planes of symmetry, each passing through a C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group. It also has a C3 axis of rotation.\n    *   The presence of planes of symmetry means the molecule is achiral. The carbons C1, C3, and C5 are prochiral, not true stereocenters, because the path around the ring from these positions is identical in both directions.\n    *   Since the molecule is achiral, it is **not optically active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The IUPAC name describes a butan-1-one parent chain, substituted with a cyclopentyl group at C1 and a methyl group at C3.\n    *   The structure is: `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. This is also known as isobutyl cyclopentyl ketone, `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`.\n    *   We need to check for any chiral centers. The only potential candidate is C3 of the butanoyl chain. However, this carbon atom is bonded to two identical methyl groups (one being C4 of the chain and one being the substituent), a hydrogen atom, and the `-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl` group. Since it is attached to two identical groups, it is not a chiral center.\n    *   The rest of the molecule also lacks any stereocenters or other elements of chirality.\n    *   The molecule is achiral and therefore **not optically active**.\n\nSummary of optically active compounds:\n- (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No\n- (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: Yes\n- (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: No (meso)\n- (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Yes\n- (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Yes\n- (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: No (achiral)\n- 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: No (achiral)\n\nThere are 3 compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThis question requires us to determine how many of the given compounds are chiral. A compound is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Chiral compounds are optically active. We will analyze each compound for elements of chirality, such as chiral centers, and the absence of elements of symmetry like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    The structure is `Cl(H)C=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`. There are no chiral centers (sp3 carbons with four different substituents). The molecule is planar around the double bond. This plane of the molecule itself acts as a plane of symmetry. Therefore, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    This compound's IUPAC name includes stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. The R/S notation is used to specify the absolute configuration of chiral centers. The naming of a specific enantiomer implies that the compound is chiral and has been resolved from its mirror image. A single enantiomer is by definition optically active. Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two stereocenters (C2 and C3). However, the substituents on C2 (`-H`, `-CH3`, `-COOH`, and `-CH(CH3)COOH`) are the same as the substituents on C3. For such symmetrically substituted molecules, the stereoisomer with an (R,S) or (S,R) configuration is a *meso* compound. A meso compound is achiral because it has an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, making it superimposable on its mirror image. Thus, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The (2R,3R) and (2S,3S) isomers of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid are a pair of enantiomers. They are chiral and non-superimposable on their mirror images. As a single, specific enantiomer, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond (between C3 and C4) and a hydroxyl group at C1. The carbon C1 is bonded to four different groups: (1) `-OH`, (2) `-H`, (3) `-CH2-CH=`, and (4) `-CH2-CH2-CH=`. The two paths around the ring from C1 are different, so C1 is a chiral center. The name specifies a single enantiomer `(R)`. This compound is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    This is a 1,3,5-trisubstituted cyclohexane. The `(1s,3s,5s)` notation, although non-standard, likely implies that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (the *all-cis* isomer). This molecule has a high degree of symmetry. It has a C3 rotational axis and three planes of symmetry. Each plane passes through one hydroxylated carbon and the carbon at the opposite side of the ring. Due to the presence of these planes of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**. The other possible stereoisomer (one -OH trans to the other two) is also achiral.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    Let's determine the structure from the IUPAC name. The parent chain is `butan-1-one`, which means a four-carbon chain with a ketone at position 1: `C4-C3-C2-C1(=O)`. There is a methyl substituent at C3 and a cyclopentyl group at C1. The full structure is `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. We need to check for chiral centers. Let's analyze C3. It is bonded to: (1) a hydrogen atom, (2) the terminal methyl group (C4), (3) the methyl substituent, and (4) the `-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl` group. Groups (2) and (3) are both methyl groups, so they are identical. Since C3 does not have four different substituents, it is not a chiral center. The molecule has no other potential chiral centers and no other elements of chirality. Therefore, it is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\nSummary:\n*   Optically Active: (2), (4), (5)\n*   Optically Inactive: (1), (3), (6), (7)\n\nThere are 3 compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity. A compound is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature leading to chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters. A compound with stereocenters but also an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is called a meso compound and is achiral (optically inactive).\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** ClHC=C(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃).\n    *   **Analysis:** This is an alkene. The atoms involved in the double bond (C1, C2) and the atoms directly attached to them (Cl, H, C of methyl, C of ethyl) lie in a single plane. This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Molecules with a plane of symmetry are achiral. Therefore, this compound is **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex bicyclic molecule. The key part of the name is the stereochemical descriptors: **(3aR,7aS,E)**.\n    *   **Analysis:** These descriptors specify the absolute configuration at two stereocenters (3a and 7a) and the geometry of a double bond (E). The designation of a specific enantiomer (using R/S notation) for a complex molecule that does not possess internal symmetry (it is not a meso compound) means the molecule is chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** A pure sample of a single enantiomer is always optically active. Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH. This molecule has two stereocenters, C2 and C3.\n    *   **Analysis:** The stereocenters have opposite configurations (one R, one S). The substituents on C2 (H, CH₃, COOH) are identical to those on C3. Let's visualize the molecule. It's possible to find a conformation that possesses a center of inversion midway between the C2-C3 bond. A molecule with a center of inversion is achiral. This is a classic example of a **meso compound**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Meso compounds are achiral and thus optically inactive. Therefore, this compound is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH. The two stereocenters are C2 and C3.\n    *   **Analysis:** The stereocenters have the same configuration (both R). This molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) isomer, which is non-superimposable. The (2R,3R) and (2S,3S) isomers form an enantiomeric pair.\n    *   **Conclusion:** As a chiral molecule, a pure sample of the (2R,3R) enantiomer is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an -OH group on C1.\n    *   **Analysis:** C1 is bonded to four different groups: -OH, -H, the -CH₂-CH₂- path, and the -CH=CH- path. Therefore, C1 is a stereocenter. The name specifies a single enantiomer, the (R)-isomer. A molecule with a single stereocenter is chiral (unless it can racemize under ambient conditions, which is not the case here).\n    *   **Conclusion:** A pure sample of the (R) enantiomer is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with -OH groups at C1, C3, and C5.\n    *   **Analysis:** This name is subtle. The lowercase `s` descriptor is the IUPAC designation for absolute configuration (equivalent to `S`), often used for pseudoasymmetric centers or in specific compound classes. The use of absolute configuration descriptors like `(1s,3s,5s)` implies that C1, C3, and C5 are true stereocenters. This can only happen if the molecule as a whole is chiral. The all-cis isomer of cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol is highly symmetric (it has a C₃ axis and three planes of symmetry) and is achiral; its C1, C3, C5 atoms are not stereocenters because the paths around the ring are identical. Therefore, the name must refer to a chiral diastereomer, specifically the one where two -OH groups are cis to each other and one is trans. This diastereomer is chiral, and the name specifies one of its two enantiomers.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the name specifies a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** (CH₃)₂CH-CH₂-C(=O)-(C₅H₉).\n    *   **Analysis:** Let's search for stereocenters. The carbon at position 3 is bonded to a hydrogen, a -CH₂- group, and two identical methyl (-CH₃) groups. Since it is bonded to two identical groups, it is not a stereocenter. No other atom in the molecule is a stereocenter. The molecule also possesses a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the molecule is achiral, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n**Summary:**\n- Optically inactive: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. (3 compounds)\n- Optically active: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione, (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. (4 compounds)\n\nThere are 4 compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine its optical activity. A compound is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is not superimposable on its mirror image. This typically arises from the presence of a chiral center (an atom bonded to four different groups) and the absence of any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`. The double bond geometry is Z (cis), meaning the Cl and the ethyl group (-CH2CH3) are on the same side of the double bond.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule contains a double bond. All atoms involved in the double bond (C1, C2, H on C1, Cl on C1, C of methyl, C of ethyl) lie in the same plane. This plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the molecule (assuming free rotation of the ethyl group). There are no chiral centers in the molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is achiral and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex tricyclic molecule. The name itself provides the crucial information.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The stereochemical descriptors `(3aR, 7aS)` indicate the presence of chiral centers with a specific absolute configuration. A name that specifies a single stereoisomer with `R` or `S` designations implies that the molecule is chiral and the name refers to one of its enantiomers. While some molecules with chiral centers can be achiral (meso compounds), this molecule's complex and unsymmetrical structure (due to the E-chloromethylene group, `=CHCl`, and the tricyclic core) makes it extremely unlikely to have a plane of symmetry or center of inversion. A specific enantiomer of a chiral compound is always optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is chiral and therefore **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two chiral centers at C2 and C3.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The `(2R, 3S)` designation indicates the stereochemistry. Let's analyze its symmetry. If you draw the molecule in a staggered conformation or a Fischer projection, you can identify a center of inversion (`i`) halfway along the C2-C3 bond. In an eclipsed conformation, a plane of symmetry (σ) becomes apparent. The presence of these symmetry elements means the molecule is achiral, despite having two chiral centers. This is a classic example of a meso compound.\n        ```\n          COOH\n          |\n      H --|-- CH3   (2R)\n          |\n    CH3 --|-- H     (3S)\n          |\n          COOH\n        (Center of inversion is present)\n        ```\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is a meso compound, which is achiral. It is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a diastereomer of the previous compound, `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH` with the `(2R,3R)` configuration.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** This stereoisomer lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` compound, which is non-superimposable. The `(2R,3R)` and `(2S,3S)` forms constitute a pair of enantiomers.\n        ```\n              COOH\n              |\n          H --|-- CH3   (2R)\n              |\n          H --|-- CH3   (3R)\n              |\n              COOH\n        (No internal symmetry elements)\n        ```\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is chiral and therefore **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an alcohol group at C1.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The carbon at position 1 (C1) is bonded to four different groups: 1) -OH, 2) -H, 3) the ring segment `-CH2-CH=` (path C2-C3), and 4) the ring segment `-CH2-CH2-` (path C6-C5). Since these four groups are different, C1 is a chiral center. The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is chiral and a specific enantiomer is given. It is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The `(1s,3s,5s)` notation implies that all three -OH groups are on the same side of the ring (the all-cis isomer).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** There are two possible stereoisomers for 1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol: the all-cis isomer and the cis,trans isomer (one -OH trans to the other two).\n        *   The all-cis isomer possesses a C3 rotational axis and three planes of symmetry. Each plane of symmetry contains one C-OH bond and the CH2 group on the opposite side of the ring.\n        *   The cis,trans isomer (e.g., 1,3-cis, 5-trans) also possesses a plane of symmetry passing through the carbon atom of the trans-substituent (C5) and the CH2 group opposite to it (C2).\n        Since both possible stereoisomers of this compound have at least one plane of symmetry, they are all achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** The name indicates a butan-1-one parent chain, meaning a 4-carbon chain with a ketone at C1. The group at C1 is cyclopentyl, and there is a methyl group at C3. This leads to the structure: `Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** We need to search for any chiral centers.\n        *   The isobutyl group `–CH2–CH(CH3)2` has no chiral center (the carbon with two methyl groups is not chiral).\n        *   The carbonyl carbon is sp2 hybridized and not a chiral center.\n        *   The cyclopentyl ring has a single, achiral substituent. The ring itself retains a plane of symmetry.\n        The entire molecule is symmetrical and has no chiral centers.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive (meso)\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive (achiral)\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are a total of 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine its optical activity. A compound is optically active if it is chiral and not present as a 50/50 mixture of enantiomers (a racemic mixture). Naming a specific stereoisomer implies we are considering it in its pure form. A molecule is chiral if it is not superimposable on its mirror image, which is equivalent to saying it lacks any improper axis of rotation (S_n), including a plane of symmetry (σ = S_1) and a center of inversion (i = S_2).\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)\n    *   **Analysis:** The molecule is an alkene. The atoms of the double bond (C1, C2) and the atoms directly attached to them (Cl, H from C1; a C from methyl and a C from ethyl from C2) lie in a single plane. Due to the sp2 hybridization of the carbons in the double bond, the molecule is planar. Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not optically active.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex bicyclic molecule.\n    *   **Analysis:** The name explicitly defines a single, specific stereoisomer. The designations `(3aR,7aS)` refer to the absolute configuration at two stereocenters (chiral carbons). The existence of stable enantiomers with specific R/S configurations is a hallmark of a chiral molecule. Since a specific enantiomer is named, it is not a racemic mixture. A pure enantiomer of a chiral compound is always optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule has two stereocenters at C2 and C3. The four groups attached to C2 are the same as the four groups attached to C3 (H, CH3, COOH, and the other chiral carbon group). When a molecule has two identical stereocenters, the diastereomer with opposite configurations (one R, one S) is called a meso compound. A meso compound is achiral because it has an internal element of symmetry (in this case, a center of inversion). Achiral molecules are not optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not optically active (it's a meso compound).\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. It has the same configuration at both stereocenters (`R,R`). This stereoisomer lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. Therefore, it is chiral. Its non-superimposable mirror image is the (2S,3S) enantiomer. The name specifies a single enantiomer, (2R,3R).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring containing one double bond, with a hydroxyl group on a saturated carbon.\n    *   **Analysis:** Carbon-1 is a stereocenter because it is attached to four different groups: an -OH group, a -H atom, a -CH=CH- segment of the ring (C2-C3 path), and a -CH2-CH2- segment of the ring (C6-C5 path). The molecule as a whole lacks internal symmetry. The name `(R)` specifies a single enantiomer of this chiral molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The nomenclature `(1s,3s,5s)` indicates that all three hydroxyl groups have the same relative orientation, meaning they are all on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   **Analysis:** This all-cis isomer is a highly symmetric molecule. It has three planes of symmetry. Each plane passes through one C-OH bond and the C-H bond on the opposite carbon of the ring. A molecule with even one plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not optically active.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** (C5H9)-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)2\n    *   **Analysis:** We must check for any stereocenters or other elements of chirality. A stereocenter is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Let's examine the carbons:\n        *   In the cyclopentyl ring: All are CH2 groups and thus not stereocenters.\n        *   The carbonyl carbon (C=O) is sp2 hybridized and not a stereocenter.\n        *   In the butanoyl chain: The carbons at positions 1 (-C=O-), 2 (-CH2-), and 4 (the two -CH3) are not stereocenters. The carbon at position 3 is bonded to a hydrogen, two identical methyl groups (-CH3), and the rest of the chain. Since it's bonded to two identical groups, it is not a stereocenter.\n        *   The molecule has no stereocenters and no other sources of chirality (e.g., axial, planar). Therefore, it is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not optically active.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Optically active compounds: 2, 4, 5.\n*   Optically inactive compounds: 1, 3, 6, 7.\n\nThere are **3** optically active compounds in the list.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

The paths around the ring are different, so C1 is a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer. A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is optically active.\n    *   Therefore, it is **chiral** and optically **active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   This name describes the all-cis isomer of 1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring's average plane.\n    *   Let's analyze the symmetry of its chair conformations. The all-cis arrangement corresponds to either all three -OH groups being axial (1a, 3a, 5a) or all three being equatorial (1e, 3e, 5e) after a ring flip.\n    *   The tri-equatorial conformer possesses a C3 rotational axis and three planes of symmetry (C3v point group). Each plane passes through one C-H axial bond and the opposite C-OH equatorial group.\n    *   The tri-axial conformer also has a C3 axis and three planes of symmetry.\n    *   Since the molecule possesses planes of symmetry in its stable conformations, it is **achiral** and optically **inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   The structure is `(Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   We check for any chiral centers. The carbon atom at position 3 of the butane chain, `CH(CH3)2`, is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a chiral center. No other carbon in the chain or the ring is a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule has no stereocenters and is flexible enough to adopt conformations with a plane of symmetry (e.g., the plane containing the C=O group).\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is **achiral** and optically **inactive**.\n\nSummary:\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive (meso)\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are 3 compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nAn optically active compound is a chiral molecule that can rotate the plane of polarized light. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Let's analyze each compound to determine its chirality and thus its potential for optical activity.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   To be chiral, a molecule must lack an internal plane of symmetry and a center of inversion.\n    *   This molecule has a double bond. The atoms connected to the double bond (Cl, H, C(CH3), C(CH2CH3)) lie in the same plane.\n    *   This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is achiral and **not optically active**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   The name of this compound includes stereochemical descriptors for absolute configuration: `(3aR, 7aS)`.\n    *   The designation of R and S configurations specifies a particular stereoisomer. When a specific enantiomer of a chiral molecule is named, it is by definition chiral.\n    *   A sample consisting of a single enantiomer is optically active.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   This molecule has two stereocenters, at C2 and C3.\n    *   The substituents on C2 (H, CH3, COOH, -CH(CH3)COOH) are identical to the substituents on C3.\n    *   The configuration is given as (2R, 3S), meaning the two stereocenters have opposite configurations.\n    *   A compound with multiple stereocenters that is achiral is called a meso compound. This typically occurs when the stereocenters have opposite configurations (one R, one S) and have identical sets of substituents.\n    *   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid has a center of inversion and is a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral.\n    *   Therefore, it is **not optically active**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the previous compound. It has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n    *   The configuration is (2R, 3R), meaning both stereocenters have the same configuration.\n    *   This molecule lacks any internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is chiral.\n    *   Its mirror image is the (2S, 3S) isomer, which is non-superimposable. These two form a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   Therefore, (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   The name specifies the absolute configuration `(R)` at one of the carbons (C1).\n    *   The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: -OH, -H, the `-CH2-CH=` part of the ring, and the `-CH=CH-CH2-` part of the ring. These two paths around the ring are different. Thus, C1 is a stereocenter.\n    *   The molecule is chiral. The name specifies a single enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   This name describes the all-cis isomer, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring.\n    *   This molecule is conformationally flexible. Its most stable conformations are two interconverting chairs. Both of these chair conformations are chiral (they belong to the C3 point group).\n    *   However, a molecule is considered achiral if it can easily access any achiral conformation. The process of ring-flipping in cyclohexane passes through higher-energy boat and twist-boat conformations. For the all-cis-1,3,5-triol, there exists an accessible boat conformation that possesses a plane of symmetry (a C_s point group).\n    *   Because the molecule can readily pass through an achiral conformation, the chiral conformers rapidly interconvert, resulting in a racemic mixture that cannot be resolved. Thus, the compound as a whole is considered achiral.\n    *   Therefore, it is **not optically active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   The structure is a cyclopentyl group attached to a carbonyl, which is then attached to an isobutyl group: `(C5H9)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   Let's check for stereocenters. There are none. All carbons are bonded to at least two identical groups (e.g., two H's on a CH2, or two CH3's on the CH).\n    *   The molecule is flexible due to single bond rotation. It is possible to find a conformation that has a plane of symmetry. This plane would contain the carbonyl group (C=O) and bisect both the cyclopentyl ring and the isobutyl group.\n    *   Since the molecule has no stereocenters and has accessible conformations with a plane of symmetry, it is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, it is **not optically active**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe compounds that will exhibit optical activity are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nA compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral and present in a non-racemic form. A molecule is chiral if it is not superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters. However, a molecule with stereocenters can be achiral if it is a meso compound (possessing an internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion). Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   The molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond. The atoms bonded to the sp2 carbons (Cl, H, C, C) lie in the same plane. The molecule is planar.\n    *   Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore achiral.\n    *   Thus, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   The name itself provides the key information. The descriptors `(3aR,7aS)` indicate the presence of specific stereocenters with a defined absolute configuration. The `(E)` describes the geometry of the exocyclic double bond.\n    *   This designates a single, specific stereoisomer. A specific stereoisomer is always optically active unless it happens to be a meso compound.\n    *   A meso compound must possess an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. The structure is complex and unsymmetrical, particularly due to the `(E)-chloromethylene` group (`=CHCl`). This substituent breaks any potential symmetry that the parent bicyclic framework might have.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is chiral and, as a specific stereoisomer, it is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n    *   The substituents on C2 are identical to the substituents on C3 (H, CH3, COOH, and the other chiral carbon group).\n    *   For a molecule with two identical stereocenters, the isomer with the (R,S) or (S,R) configuration is the meso form.\n    *   The meso form has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 bond. Because it is superimposable on its mirror image, it is achiral.\n    *   Thus, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. It is the (R,R) diastereomer.\n    *   This isomer does not have an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) isomer, and they are not superimposable.\n    *   The (2R,3R) and (2S,3S) isomers form an enantiomeric pair. As a single enantiomer is specified, it is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   This is a six-membered ring with a double bond (between C3 and C4) and an alcohol group (at C1).\n    *   The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: (1) -OH, (2) -H, (3) -CH2-CH=CH- (path towards C2), and (4) -CH2-CH2-CH= (path towards C6). The two paths around the ring are different due to the asymmetric position of the double bond relative to C1.\n    *   Therefore, C1 is a stereocenter. The name specifies the `(R)` configuration, meaning it is a single enantiomer. The molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   Thus, it is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This name describes the isomer where the three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5 are all on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all-cis).\n    *   Let's consider the chair conformation. The most stable conformation would have all three bulky -OH groups in equatorial positions. However, even the less stable tri-axial conformation can be considered.\n    *   In the tri-axial conformation, the molecule possesses a C3 axis of rotation and, more importantly, three vertical planes of symmetry (σv). Each plane passes through one C-OH bond and the CH2 group opposite to it.\n    *   The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral. Although the molecule has conformational isomers, the overall time-averaged molecule is achiral because the symmetric conformers are accessible.\n    *   Thus, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure is `(Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   We need to check for any stereocenters (a carbon with four different substituents).\n    *   The `CH(CH3)2` carbon is bonded to H, two identical methyl groups, and the rest of the molecule; it is not a stereocenter.\n    *   All other carbons are either sp2 hybridized (C=O) or are CH2 groups, so there are no stereocenters in the molecule.\n    *   The molecule also possesses a plane of symmetry in its most stable conformation (this plane contains the carbonyl group and bisects the cyclopentyl ring and the isobutyl group).\n    *   Since the molecule is achiral, it is **optically inactive**.\n\nSummary:\n*   **Active**: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   **Active**: (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   **Active**: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n*   **Inactive**: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\n*   **Inactive**: (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   **Inactive**: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol\n*   **Inactive**: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine its optical activity. A compound is optically active if it is chiral and present in a form that is not a racemic mixture.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** ClHC=C(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)\n    *   **Analysis:** This is an alkene. The atoms involved in the double bond (C1 and C2) and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane. The entire molecule is essentially planar. A molecule with a plane of symmetry (in this case, the molecular plane itself) is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex polycyclic molecule. The name itself provides crucial information.\n    *   **Analysis:** The stereochemical descriptors (3a**R**, 7a**S**, **E**) specify a single, unique stereoisomer. The presence of R/S descriptors indicates that there are chiral centers in the molecule. A specific enantiomer of a chiral compound is always optically active. This molecule is highly asymmetric and is not a meso compound.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Chiral and optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule has two stereocenters at C2 and C3. However, the molecule has a symmetric structure (the two ends are identical -COOH groups). The (2R, 3S) configuration results in a meso compound. A meso compound has stereocenters but is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. We can see this by drawing its Fischer projection, which has a center of inversion, making it superimposable on its mirror image.\n          COOH\n           |\n      CH₃--|--H   (R)\n           |\n      H----|--CH₃ (S)\n           |\n          COOH\n    *   This molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Achiral (meso compound) and optically inactive.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a diastereomer of the meso compound described above. The (2R,3R) and (2S,3S) isomers are a pair of enantiomers. They are chiral and non-superimposable on their mirror images. The name specifies a single enantiomer, (2R,3R).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Chiral and optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an alcohol group at C1.\n    *   **Analysis:** The carbon atom C1 is a stereocenter. It is bonded to four different groups: 1) -OH, 2) -H, 3) the ring segment -CH₂-CH=, and 4) the ring segment -CH₂-CH₂-. Since the two paths around the ring from C1 are different, C1 is a stereocenter. The name specifies the (R) configuration, meaning it is a single enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Chiral and optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl (-OH) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The notation (1s,3s,5s) implies that all three -OH groups have the same relative orientation (i.e., they are all cis to each other).\n    *   **Analysis:** This all-cis isomer is highly symmetrical. It possesses a three-fold axis of rotation (C₃) and three planes of symmetry (σᵥ). For example, a plane of symmetry passes through the C1-O bond and the C4 atom. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Achiral and optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** (CH₃)₂CHCH₂C(=O)-cyclopentyl\n    *   **Analysis:** We need to check for any chiral centers. The carbon atom at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to a hydrogen, two methyl groups (one is C4, the other is the substituent), and the -CH₂C(=O)-cyclopentyl group. Since it is bonded to two identical methyl groups, it is not a chiral center. No other atom in the molecule is a chiral center. The molecule can adopt conformations that possess a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Achiral and optically inactive.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Optically active compounds:\n    1.

A compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common structural feature leading to chirality is a stereocenter (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups). However, a molecule with stereocenters can be achiral if it possesses a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion; such compounds are called meso compounds. Conversely, some molecules without stereocenters can be chiral (e.g., allenes, atropisomers), but this is less common.\n\nWe will analyze each compound individually to determine its chirality.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`\n    *   **Analysis:** This is an alkene. The molecule is essentially planar. The plane of the molecule acts as a plane of symmetry. Therefore, the molecule is achiral and not optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Inactive.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex, polycyclic molecule with a rigid framework.\n    *   **Analysis:** The name includes stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. These `R` and `S` descriptors are used to define the absolute configuration at specific stereocenters. The presence of these descriptors in the name indicates that the molecule is chiral and that a specific, single enantiomer is being described. A single enantiomer is by definition optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule has two stereocenters (at C2 and C3). The substituents on C2 are the same as on C3 (H, CH3, COOH, and the other chiral carbon group). When a molecule has two identical stereocenters, the diastereomer with opposite configurations (`R,S` or `S,R`) is a meso compound. Meso compounds possess an internal plane of symmetry (in at least one conformation) or a center of inversion, making them achiral and optically inactive despite having stereocenters.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Inactive (meso compound).\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a diastereomer of the meso compound described above. The `(2R,3R)` configuration lacks any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule. Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` compound, and they are a pair of enantiomers. Since this compound is chiral, it is optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring containing a C=C double bond and an alcohol group.\n    *   **Analysis:** Carbon C1, bonded to the -OH group, is a stereocenter. The four groups attached to it are: -H, -OH, the path around the ring towards the double bond (-CH2-CH=), and the path around the ring away from the double bond (-CH2-CH2-CH=). These two paths are different. The molecule as a whole lacks any element of symmetry. The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer, which is a single chiral molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5, all on the same side of the ring (all `cis`).\n    *   **Analysis:** Although carbons C1, C3, and C5 are stereocenters, the molecule as a whole is highly symmetrical. It possesses a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and three planes of symmetry. Each plane of symmetry passes through one C-OH bond and the CH2 group on the opposite side of the ring. The presence of these planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** The most plausible structure based on IUPAC nomenclature is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. The parent chain is a butan-1-one, with the carbonyl as C1. A methyl group is on C3. A cyclopentyl group is on C1. This gives `(cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3`. Rechecking the numbering `C1(=O)-C2H2-C3H(CH3)-C4H3`. Yes, this is `3-methyl-butan-1-one`. The full name is `1-cyclopentyl-3-methyl-1-butanone`. The group is isobutyl, `(CH3)2CH-CH2-`. Let's build from the name again. `3-methylbutanoyl` is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-`. The ketone is cyclopentyl 3-methylbutanoyl ketone. So the structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`.\n    *   **Analysis:** Let's examine this structure for stereocenters.\n        *   The C3 of the chain is bonded to one H and two identical `CH3` groups, so it is not a stereocenter.\n        *   There are no other stereocenters in the chain or the cyclopentyl ring.\n        *   The molecule has no other sources of chirality like chiral axes or planes. Therefore, it is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Inactive.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nCounting the compounds that will exhibit optical activity, we have 3.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the optical activity of each compound. A compound is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters without any internal elements of symmetry (like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion).\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** ClHC=C(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃). This is an alkene.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is planar about the C=C double bond. This plane of the molecule acts as a plane of symmetry. Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral. There are no stereocenters.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex polycyclic molecule. The name itself provides the key information.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The name specifies a single, distinct stereoisomer with the configurations (3aR, 7aS) at two stereocenters and (E) at a double bond. When a specific enantiomer (indicated by R/S descriptors) is named, it implies the compound is chiral and has been resolved from its mirror image. Such a complex structure is highly unlikely to possess the symmetry required to be a meso compound. A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is always optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH. This molecule has two stereocenters, at C2 and C3.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is symmetric, as the groups attached to C2 are identical to the groups attached to C3 (H, CH₃, COOH). We need to check if the (2R,3S) configuration leads to a meso compound. A meso compound has stereocenters but is achiral overall due to an internal element of symmetry. For a molecule with two equivalent stereocenters, the (R,S) isomer is a meso compound. This molecule has a center of inversion midway along the C2-C3 bond. A molecule with a center of inversion is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a meso compound. Optically **inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH. This is a diastereomer of the previous compound.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** Both stereocenters have the same configuration (R,R). This molecule lacks any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is chiral, and its mirror image is the (2S,3S) compound. A specific enantiomer of a chiral compound is optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring containing a double bond (between C3 and C4) and an alcohol group (at C1).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: (1) -OH, (2) -H, (3) the -CH=CH-CH₂- path around the ring, and (4) the -CH₂-CH₂-CH= path around the ring. These two paths are different, so C1 is a stereocenter. The molecule as a whole lacks any element of symmetry. The name specifies the (R) enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl (-OH) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The nomenclature `1s,3s,5s` indicates that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (all `cis`).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** This is a highly symmetric molecule. Although C1, C3, and C5 are stereocenters, the molecule possesses multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane passing through the C1-OH bond and the C4 atom acts as a mirror plane, reflecting C2 onto C6 and C3 onto C5. Since C3 and C5 have identical substituents in the same orientation, the molecule is symmetrical with respect to this plane. The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** (CH₃)₂CH-CH₂-C(=O)-(Cyclopentyl).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** We need to check for any stereocenters or overall molecular chirality. There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. The isobutyl group `((CH₃)₂CH-CH₂-)` is not chiral. The cyclopentyl ring attached to the carbonyl group is also not chiral, as the two paths around the ring from the point of attachment are identical. The molecule as a whole possesses a plane of symmetry that includes the carbonyl group and bisects both the isobutyl group and the cyclopentyl ring.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Inactive: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene\n*   **Active**: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   Inactive: (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   **Active**: (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   **Active**: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n*   Inactive: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol\n*   Inactive: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one\n\nCounting the optically active compounds, we find there are 3.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity. A compound exhibits optical activity if and only if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is not superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of a stereocenter (a carbon atom with four different substituents), but the ultimate test is the absence of any plane of symmetry or center of inversion in the molecule.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** The molecule is an alkene. The atoms involved in the C=C double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in the same plane. The structure is:\n        ```\n           Cl   CH3\n            \\ /\n             C=C\n            / \\\n           H   CH2CH3\n        ```\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is planar. Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore achiral. It has no chiral centers.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is achiral and thus **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex, polycyclic molecule.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The name includes the stereochemical descriptors `(3aR, 7aS)`. These are Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (R/S) notations that describe the absolute configuration at two specific chiral centers (carbons 3a and 7a). The fact that a specific enantiomer is named indicates that the molecule is chiral. A single, specific enantiomer of a chiral compound is always optically active. This compound is not a meso compound because it lacks the necessary internal symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. It has two chiral centers at C2 and C3.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The two chiral centers are identically substituted (both are bonded to H, CH3, COOH, and the other chiral carbon group). For such molecules, three stereoisomers exist: a pair of enantiomers (R,R and S,S) and a meso form (R,S). The (R,S) stereoisomer has a plane of symmetry between the two carbon atoms. A compound with chiral centers but an internal plane of symmetry is a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a meso compound, which is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a different stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** This is the (R,R) isomer. It is the enantiomer of the (S,S) isomer and a diastereomer of the meso (R,S) form. The (R,R) isomer does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is a chiral molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** As a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an OH group at C1.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The name includes the stereodescriptor `(R)`, indicating that a specific enantiomer is being described. Let's verify the chirality. The carbon C1 is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, the ring path -CH2-CH=CH- (C2-C3-C4), and the ring path -CH2-CH2-CH= (C6-C5-C4). Since these two paths around the ring are different, C1 is a chiral center. The molecule as a whole lacks any plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is chiral, and a single enantiomer `(R)` is specified, so it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with OH groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** Due to the symmetric 1,3,5-substitution pattern, the carbons C1, C3, and C5 are not chiral centers. For example, at C1, the path C1-C2-C3(OH)-C4-C5(OH)-C6 is identical to the path C1-C6-C5(OH)-C4-C3(OH)-C2. Thus, the two ring attachments to C1 are identical. The same applies to C3 and C5. Furthermore, any stereoisomer of this compound (e.g., all-cis or cis-trans) will possess at least one plane of symmetry. For instance, the all-`cis` isomer has three planes of symmetry. The notation (1s,3s,5s) is non-standard, but it cannot make an inherently achiral structure chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** (CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-(cyclopentyl ring)\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** We look for any chiral centers (sp3 carbons with four different substituents).\n        *   The cyclopentyl ring consists of -CH2- groups. No chiral center.\n        *   The carbonyl carbon is sp2. Not a chiral center.\n        *   The carbon C2 (-CH2-) is not a chiral center.\n        *   The carbon C3 is bonded to a H, the rest of the chain, and two identical methyl (-CH3) groups. Since it has two identical groups, it is not a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers and no other elements of chirality (like axial or planar chirality). It is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n*   **Active:** (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   **Active:** (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   **Active:** (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are **3** compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nAn optically active compound is a chiral compound. A compound is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This property is most often due to the presence of one or more chiral centers, but can also arise from other elements of chirality like axial or planar chirality. A compound is achiral (and thus optically inactive) if it possesses an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:**\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   There are no chiral centers (carbon atoms bonded to four different groups) in this molecule.\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry that contains the `C=C` double bond and all the atoms directly attached to it. Therefore, it is achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Not optically active**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione:**\n    *   The name includes stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS,E)`. This indicates that the compound is a single, specific stereoisomer.\n    *   The presence of `R` and `S` descriptors signifies the absolute configuration at chiral centers. Since a specific enantiomer is named, the compound must be chiral. A pure sample of a single enantiomer is optically active.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:**\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two chiral centers at C2 and C3.\n    *   However, the molecule is symmetric, meaning the groups on C2 are the same as on C3 (H, CH3, COOH, and the other chiral carbon group).\n    *   In such cases, the diastereomer with opposite configurations at the two identical chiral centers (one R, one S) is called a *meso* compound.\n    *   A meso compound is achiral because it has an internal element of symmetry (in this case, a center of inversion when drawn appropriately) and is superimposable on its mirror image. Achiral compounds are not optically active.\n    *   Conclusion: **Not optically active**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:**\n    *   This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. The `(2R,3R)` configuration is diastereomeric to the meso `(2R,3S)` form.\n    *   The `(2R,3R)` isomer and its mirror image, the `(2S,3S)` isomer, are not superimposable on each other. They form an enantiomeric pair.\n    *   As a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, it is optically active.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:**\n    *   The name specifies a single enantiomer, the `(R)` isomer.\n    *   The carbon at position 1 is a chiral center. It is bonded to four different groups: -OH, -H, the alkene part of the ring (`-CH=CH-`), and the alkane part of the ring (`-CH2-CH2-`).\n    *   Since a single enantiomer is specified, it is a chiral compound and will be optically active.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:**\n    *   This nomenclature typically refers to the isomer where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (the *cis* isomer).\n    *   This molecule possesses a high degree of symmetry. It has a C3 axis of rotation perpendicular to the ring. More importantly, it has three vertical planes of symmetry, each passing through one C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group.\n    *   The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Not optically active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:**\n    *   Let's determine the structure from the IUPAC name. The parent chain is `butan-1-one`, which is a 4-carbon chain with a ketone at C1. A cyclopentyl group is attached to C1, and a methyl group is attached to C3.\n    *   The structure is: `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`. This can also be seen as a ketone formed from a cyclopentyl group and an isobutyl group `((CH3)2CH-CH2-)`.\n    *   We need to check for chiral centers. The only candidate is C3 of the butane chain. Let's analyze the groups attached to it by tracing the chain from that carbon:\n        *   The structure can be written as `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`.\n        *   The carbon in question is the `CH` of the isobutyl group. It is bonded to one H atom, two methyl (-CH3) groups, and one `-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl` group.\n    *   Since it is bonded to two identical methyl groups, it is not a chiral center. The molecule has no other chiral centers. Therefore, it is achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Not optically active**.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe compounds that will exhibit optical activity are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine its optical activity. A compound is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicators of chirality are the presence of one or more stereocenters and the absence of any plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`\n    *   **Analysis:** This is an alkene.

Not a chiral center.\n        *   The terminal CH3 carbon (C4) is bonded to three identical hydrogen atoms. Not a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers. Furthermore, the entire molecule is planar.

For a molecule to be named with specific `R` and `S` configurations for its stereocenters (and not be described as meso), it must be a chiral molecule.\n        *   Let's consider the possibility of it being a meso compound. The parent structure (without the C8 substituent) could potentially have a plane of symmetry. However, the substituent `8-(chloromethylene)` which is `=CHCl` is located on the methano bridge of the norbornane system. This substituent is asymmetric and breaks any potential plane of symmetry in the parent skeleton.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is chiral, and a specific enantiomer is given.

In the most stable conformation of the all-cis isomer, the three -OH groups can occupy the 1, 3, and 5 axial positions (all pointing \"up,\" for example).\n        *   This molecule, despite having stereocenters (C1, C3, C5), is highly symmetrical. It has a C3 axis of rotation and, more importantly, three planes of symmetry. Each plane passes through one C-OH bond and the opposite carbon atom (e.g., the plane containing C1, O1, and C4).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Due to the presence of planes of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** `Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`\n    *   **Analysis:** Let's search for any chiral elements.\n        *   **Chiral Centers:** There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups.

These R/S assignments specify a particular stereoisomer.\n    *   The presence of such specific descriptors indicates that the molecule has stereocenters and that we are considering a single, defined stereoisomer.\n    *   Unless this specific combination of R and S configurations results in a meso compound (which is highly unlikely for such a complex, unsymmetrical structure), the molecule is chiral. A single enantiomer is, by definition, chiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two stereocenters, at C2 and C3.\n    *   The substituents on C2 are the same as on C3 (-H, -CH3, -COOH). This suggests the possibility of a meso compound.\n    *   The (2R,3S) configuration refers to the meso form of this molecule. A meso compound has stereocenters but is achiral overall due to an internal element of symmetry.\n    *   Let's draw the molecule in a staggered conformation looking down the C2-C3 bond. The (2R, 3S) conformer can adopt a conformation with a center of inversion (a point of symmetry). It also has a conformation with a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Because it is a meso compound, it is achiral and **not optically active**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.\n    *   The (2R,3R) configuration and its mirror image, (2S,3S), are enantiomers. They are non-superimposable mirror images.\n    *   This molecule lacks any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   Thus, the (2R,3R) isomer is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond (between C3 and C4) and a hydroxyl group on C1.\n    *   The name specifies the `(R)` configuration at C1. C1 is a stereocenter because it is attached to four different groups: -H, -OH, -CH2-CH=, and -CH2-CH2-CH=.\n    *   The molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   Since the name describes a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This is cyclohexane with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5, all on the same side of the ring (cis).\n    *   Let's consider its chair conformation. With all OH groups in axial positions, the molecule has three planes of symmetry, each passing through a C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group. It also has a C3 axis of rotation.\n    *   The presence of planes of symmetry means the molecule is achiral. The carbons C1, C3, and C5 are prochiral, not true stereocenters, because the path around the ring from these positions is identical in both directions.\n    *   Since the molecule is achiral, it is **not optically active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The IUPAC name describes a butan-1-one parent chain, substituted with a cyclopentyl group at C1 and a methyl group at C3.\n    *   The structure is: `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. This is also known as isobutyl cyclopentyl ketone, `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`.\n    *   We need to check for any chiral centers. The only potential candidate is C3 of the butanoyl chain. However, this carbon atom is bonded to two identical methyl groups (one being C4 of the chain and one being the substituent), a hydrogen atom, and the `-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl` group. Since it is attached to two identical groups, it is not a chiral center.\n    *   The rest of the molecule also lacks any stereocenters or other elements of chirality.\n    *   The molecule is achiral and therefore **not optically active**.\n\nSummary of optically active compounds:\n- (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No\n- (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: Yes\n- (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: No (meso)\n- (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Yes\n- (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Yes\n- (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: No (achiral)\n- 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: No (achiral)\n\nThere are 3 compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThis question requires us to determine how many of the given compounds are chiral. A compound is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Chiral compounds are optically active. We will analyze each compound for elements of chirality, such as chiral centers, and the absence of elements of symmetry like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    The structure is `Cl(H)C=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`. There are no chiral centers (sp3 carbons with four different substituents). The molecule is planar around the double bond. This plane of the molecule itself acts as a plane of symmetry. Therefore, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    This compound's IUPAC name includes stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. The R/S notation is used to specify the absolute configuration of chiral centers. The naming of a specific enantiomer implies that the compound is chiral and has been resolved from its mirror image. A single enantiomer is by definition optically active. Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two stereocenters (C2 and C3). However, the substituents on C2 (`-H`, `-CH3`, `-COOH`, and `-CH(CH3)COOH`) are the same as the substituents on C3. For such symmetrically substituted molecules, the stereoisomer with an (R,S) or (S,R) configuration is a *meso* compound. A meso compound is achiral because it has an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, making it superimposable on its mirror image. Thus, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The (2R,3R) and (2S,3S) isomers of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid are a pair of enantiomers. They are chiral and non-superimposable on their mirror images. As a single, specific enantiomer, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond (between C3 and C4) and a hydroxyl group at C1. The carbon C1 is bonded to four different groups: (1) `-OH`, (2) `-H`, (3) `-CH2-CH=`, and (4) `-CH2-CH2-CH=`. The two paths around the ring from C1 are different, so C1 is a chiral center. The name specifies a single enantiomer `(R)`. This compound is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    This is a 1,3,5-trisubstituted cyclohexane. The `(1s,3s,5s)` notation, although non-standard, likely implies that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (the *all-cis* isomer). This molecule has a high degree of symmetry. It has a C3 rotational axis and three planes of symmetry. Each plane passes through one hydroxylated carbon and the carbon at the opposite side of the ring. Due to the presence of these planes of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**. The other possible stereoisomer (one -OH trans to the other two) is also achiral.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    Let's determine the structure from the IUPAC name. The parent chain is `butan-1-one`, which means a four-carbon chain with a ketone at position 1: `C4-C3-C2-C1(=O)`. There is a methyl substituent at C3 and a cyclopentyl group at C1. The full structure is `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. We need to check for chiral centers. Let's analyze C3. It is bonded to: (1) a hydrogen atom, (2) the terminal methyl group (C4), (3) the methyl substituent, and (4) the `-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl` group. Groups (2) and (3) are both methyl groups, so they are identical. Since C3 does not have four different substituents, it is not a chiral center. The molecule has no other potential chiral centers and no other elements of chirality. Therefore, it is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\nSummary:\n*   Optically Active: (2), (4), (5)\n*   Optically Inactive: (1), (3), (6), (7)\n\nThere are 3 compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity. A compound is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature leading to chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters. A compound with stereocenters but also an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is called a meso compound and is achiral (optically inactive).\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** ClHC=C(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃).\n    *   **Analysis:** This is an alkene. The atoms involved in the double bond (C1, C2) and the atoms directly attached to them (Cl, H, C of methyl, C of ethyl) lie in a single plane. This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Molecules with a plane of symmetry are achiral. Therefore, this compound is **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex bicyclic molecule. The key part of the name is the stereochemical descriptors: **(3aR,7aS,E)**.\n    *   **Analysis:** These descriptors specify the absolute configuration at two stereocenters (3a and 7a) and the geometry of a double bond (E). The designation of a specific enantiomer (using R/S notation) for a complex molecule that does not possess internal symmetry (it is not a meso compound) means the molecule is chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** A pure sample of a single enantiomer is always optically active. Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH. This molecule has two stereocenters, C2 and C3.\n    *   **Analysis:** The stereocenters have opposite configurations (one R, one S). The substituents on C2 (H, CH₃, COOH) are identical to those on C3. Let's visualize the molecule. It's possible to find a conformation that possesses a center of inversion midway between the C2-C3 bond. A molecule with a center of inversion is achiral. This is a classic example of a **meso compound**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Meso compounds are achiral and thus optically inactive. Therefore, this compound is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH. The two stereocenters are C2 and C3.\n    *   **Analysis:** The stereocenters have the same configuration (both R). This molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) isomer, which is non-superimposable. The (2R,3R) and (2S,3S) isomers form an enantiomeric pair.\n    *   **Conclusion:** As a chiral molecule, a pure sample of the (2R,3R) enantiomer is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an -OH group on C1.\n    *   **Analysis:** C1 is bonded to four different groups: -OH, -H, the -CH₂-CH₂- path, and the -CH=CH- path. Therefore, C1 is a stereocenter. The name specifies a single enantiomer, the (R)-isomer. A molecule with a single stereocenter is chiral (unless it can racemize under ambient conditions, which is not the case here).\n    *   **Conclusion:** A pure sample of the (R) enantiomer is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with -OH groups at C1, C3, and C5.\n    *   **Analysis:** This name is subtle. The lowercase `s` descriptor is the IUPAC designation for absolute configuration (equivalent to `S`), often used for pseudoasymmetric centers or in specific compound classes. The use of absolute configuration descriptors like `(1s,3s,5s)` implies that C1, C3, and C5 are true stereocenters. This can only happen if the molecule as a whole is chiral. The all-cis isomer of cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol is highly symmetric (it has a C₃ axis and three planes of symmetry) and is achiral; its C1, C3, C5 atoms are not stereocenters because the paths around the ring are identical. Therefore, the name must refer to a chiral diastereomer, specifically the one where two -OH groups are cis to each other and one is trans. This diastereomer is chiral, and the name specifies one of its two enantiomers.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the name specifies a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** (CH₃)₂CH-CH₂-C(=O)-(C₅H₉).\n    *   **Analysis:** Let's search for stereocenters. The carbon at position 3 is bonded to a hydrogen, a -CH₂- group, and two identical methyl (-CH₃) groups. Since it is bonded to two identical groups, it is not a stereocenter. No other atom in the molecule is a stereocenter. The molecule also possesses a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the molecule is achiral, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n**Summary:**\n- Optically inactive: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. (3 compounds)\n- Optically active: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione, (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. (4 compounds)\n\nThere are 4 compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine its optical activity. A compound is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is not superimposable on its mirror image. This typically arises from the presence of a chiral center (an atom bonded to four different groups) and the absence of any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`. The double bond geometry is Z (cis), meaning the Cl and the ethyl group (-CH2CH3) are on the same side of the double bond.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule contains a double bond. All atoms involved in the double bond (C1, C2, H on C1, Cl on C1, C of methyl, C of ethyl) lie in the same plane. This plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the molecule (assuming free rotation of the ethyl group). There are no chiral centers in the molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is achiral and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex tricyclic molecule. The name itself provides the crucial information.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The stereochemical descriptors `(3aR, 7aS)` indicate the presence of chiral centers with a specific absolute configuration. A name that specifies a single stereoisomer with `R` or `S` designations implies that the molecule is chiral and the name refers to one of its enantiomers. While some molecules with chiral centers can be achiral (meso compounds), this molecule's complex and unsymmetrical structure (due to the E-chloromethylene group, `=CHCl`, and the tricyclic core) makes it extremely unlikely to have a plane of symmetry or center of inversion. A specific enantiomer of a chiral compound is always optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is chiral and therefore **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. This molecule has two chiral centers at C2 and C3.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The `(2R, 3S)` designation indicates the stereochemistry. Let's analyze its symmetry. If you draw the molecule in a staggered conformation or a Fischer projection, you can identify a center of inversion (`i`) halfway along the C2-C3 bond. In an eclipsed conformation, a plane of symmetry (σ) becomes apparent. The presence of these symmetry elements means the molecule is achiral, despite having two chiral centers. This is a classic example of a meso compound.\n        ```\n          COOH\n          |\n      H --|-- CH3   (2R)\n          |\n    CH3 --|-- H     (3S)\n          |\n          COOH\n        (Center of inversion is present)\n        ```\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is a meso compound, which is achiral. It is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a diastereomer of the previous compound, `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH` with the `(2R,3R)` configuration.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** This stereoisomer lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` compound, which is non-superimposable. The `(2R,3R)` and `(2S,3S)` forms constitute a pair of enantiomers.\n        ```\n              COOH\n              |\n          H --|-- CH3   (2R)\n              |\n          H --|-- CH3   (3R)\n              |\n              COOH\n        (No internal symmetry elements)\n        ```\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is chiral and therefore **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an alcohol group at C1.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The carbon at position 1 (C1) is bonded to four different groups: 1) -OH, 2) -H, 3) the ring segment `-CH2-CH=` (path C2-C3), and 4) the ring segment `-CH2-CH2-` (path C6-C5). Since these four groups are different, C1 is a chiral center. The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is chiral and a specific enantiomer is given. It is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The `(1s,3s,5s)` notation implies that all three -OH groups are on the same side of the ring (the all-cis isomer).\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** There are two possible stereoisomers for 1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol: the all-cis isomer and the cis,trans isomer (one -OH trans to the other two).\n        *   The all-cis isomer possesses a C3 rotational axis and three planes of symmetry. Each plane of symmetry contains one C-OH bond and the CH2 group on the opposite side of the ring.\n        *   The cis,trans isomer (e.g., 1,3-cis, 5-trans) also possesses a plane of symmetry passing through the carbon atom of the trans-substituent (C5) and the CH2 group opposite to it (C2).\n        Since both possible stereoisomers of this compound have at least one plane of symmetry, they are all achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** The name indicates a butan-1-one parent chain, meaning a 4-carbon chain with a ketone at C1. The group at C1 is cyclopentyl, and there is a methyl group at C3. This leads to the structure: `Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** We need to search for any chiral centers.\n        *   The isobutyl group `–CH2–CH(CH3)2` has no chiral center (the carbon with two methyl groups is not chiral).\n        *   The carbonyl carbon is sp2 hybridized and not a chiral center.\n        *   The cyclopentyl ring has a single, achiral substituent. The ring itself retains a plane of symmetry.\n        The entire molecule is symmetrical and has no chiral centers.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive (meso)\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive (achiral)\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are a total of 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine its optical activity. A compound is optically active if it is chiral and not present as a 50/50 mixture of enantiomers (a racemic mixture). Naming a specific stereoisomer implies we are considering it in its pure form. A molecule is chiral if it is not superimposable on its mirror image, which is equivalent to saying it lacks any improper axis of rotation (S_n), including a plane of symmetry (σ = S_1) and a center of inversion (i = S_2).\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)\n    *   **Analysis:** The molecule is an alkene. The atoms of the double bond (C1, C2) and the atoms directly attached to them (Cl, H from C1; a C from methyl and a C from ethyl from C2) lie in a single plane. Due to the sp2 hybridization of the carbons in the double bond, the molecule is planar. Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not optically active.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex bicyclic molecule.\n    *   **Analysis:** The name explicitly defines a single, specific stereoisomer. The designations `(3aR,7aS)` refer to the absolute configuration at two stereocenters (chiral carbons). The existence of stable enantiomers with specific R/S configurations is a hallmark of a chiral molecule. Since a specific enantiomer is named, it is not a racemic mixture. A pure enantiomer of a chiral compound is always optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule has two stereocenters at C2 and C3. The four groups attached to C2 are the same as the four groups attached to C3 (H, CH3, COOH, and the other chiral carbon group). When a molecule has two identical stereocenters, the diastereomer with opposite configurations (one R, one S) is called a meso compound. A meso compound is achiral because it has an internal element of symmetry (in this case, a center of inversion). Achiral molecules are not optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not optically active (it's a meso compound).\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. It has the same configuration at both stereocenters (`R,R`). This stereoisomer lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. Therefore, it is chiral. Its non-superimposable mirror image is the (2S,3S) enantiomer. The name specifies a single enantiomer, (2R,3R).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring containing one double bond, with a hydroxyl group on a saturated carbon.\n    *   **Analysis:** Carbon-1 is a stereocenter because it is attached to four different groups: an -OH group, a -H atom, a -CH=CH- segment of the ring (C2-C3 path), and a -CH2-CH2- segment of the ring (C6-C5 path). The molecule as a whole lacks internal symmetry. The name `(R)` specifies a single enantiomer of this chiral molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The nomenclature `(1s,3s,5s)` indicates that all three hydroxyl groups have the same relative orientation, meaning they are all on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   **Analysis:** This all-cis isomer is a highly symmetric molecule. It has three planes of symmetry. Each plane passes through one C-OH bond and the C-H bond on the opposite carbon of the ring. A molecule with even one plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not optically active.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** (C5H9)-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)2\n    *   **Analysis:** We must check for any stereocenters or other elements of chirality. A stereocenter is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Let's examine the carbons:\n        *   In the cyclopentyl ring: All are CH2 groups and thus not stereocenters.\n        *   The carbonyl carbon (C=O) is sp2 hybridized and not a stereocenter.\n        *   In the butanoyl chain: The carbons at positions 1 (-C=O-), 2 (-CH2-), and 4 (the two -CH3) are not stereocenters. The carbon at position 3 is bonded to a hydrogen, two identical methyl groups (-CH3), and the rest of the chain. Since it's bonded to two identical groups, it is not a stereocenter.\n        *   The molecule has no stereocenters and no other sources of chirality (e.g., axial, planar). Therefore, it is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not optically active.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Optically active compounds: 2, 4, 5.\n*   Optically inactive compounds: 1, 3, 6, 7.\n\nThere are **3** optically active compounds in the list.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
