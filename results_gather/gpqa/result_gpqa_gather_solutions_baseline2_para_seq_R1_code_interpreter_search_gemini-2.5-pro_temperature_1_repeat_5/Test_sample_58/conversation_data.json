Calculate the initial number of moles for all acidic and basic species.**\nThe number of moles is calculated by multiplying the molarity (M or mol/L) by the volume in liters (L).\n\n*   **Moles of H+ from HCl:**\n    *   HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely in water (HCl → H⁺ + Cl⁻).\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles of H⁺ = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = **0.080 mol**\n\n*   **Moles of CH3COOH:**\n    *   CH3COOH is a weak acid.

Determine the total moles of acid and base to find the excess reactant.**\nThe strong base (OH⁻) will neutralize all available acidic protons from both the strong acid (HCl) and the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n\n*   **Total moles of acid** = Moles of H⁺ (from HCl) + Moles of CH3COOH\n    *   Total moles of acid = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = **0.130 mol**\n*   **Total moles of base (OH⁻)** = **0.180 mol**\n\nComparing the two, we see that the moles of base (0.180 mol) are greater than the total moles of acid (0.130 mol). Therefore, the base is in excess, and the final solution will be basic.\n\n**4. Calculate the moles of excess base.**\n\n*   **Excess moles of OH⁻** = Total moles of OH⁻ - Total moles of acid\n    *   Excess moles of OH⁻ = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = **0.050 mol**\n\n**5.

Therefore, it provides 2 × 0.09 = 0.18 moles of OH⁻ ions.\n\nNext, we need to determine the net reaction. The strong acid (H⁺ from HCl) and the strong base (OH⁻ from Ba(OH)2) will react first in a neutralization reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Neutralization of Strong Acid and Strong Base**\nThe reaction is H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O.\n*   Initial moles of H⁺ = 0.08 mol\n*   Initial moles of OH⁻ = 0.18 mol\nThe H⁺ ions are the limiting reactant. They will be completely consumed, and there will be an excess of OH⁻ ions.\n*   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.18 mol - 0.08 mol = 0.10 mol\n\n**Step 2: Reaction of Remaining Strong Base with Weak Acid**\nThe remaining 0.10 moles of OH⁻ will then react with the weak acid, CH3COOH.\nThe reaction is CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O.\n*   Initial moles of CH₃COOH = 0.05 mol\n*   Moles of OH⁻ available = 0.10 mol\nHere, the CH₃COOH is the limiting reactant.

    "This is a classic acid-base neutralization problem that involves a weak acid, a strong acid, and a strong base. The correct approach is to calculate the total moles of acidic protons and the total moles of hydroxide ions, determine which is in excess, and then calculate the final pH based on the concentration of the excess species.\n\n**1.

Perform Stoichiometric Neutralization**\n\nTo find out what remains, we can sum all the acid species and compare it to the base. The strong base (OH⁻) will neutralize all available acidic protons.\n*   **Total moles of acid (protons):** Moles from HCl + Moles from CH3COOH\n    *   Total acid = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = 0.130 mol\n*   **Total moles of base (hydroxide):**\n    *   Total base = 0.180 mol\n\nComparing the total acid and base, we see that the base is in excess.\n*   **Moles of excess OH⁻:** Total base - Total acid\n    *   Excess OH⁻ = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = 0.050 mol\n\n**3.

A review of the candidate answers shows that while nearly all of them performed the calculation correctly to arrive at the value of 12.62, many made a mistake in selecting the final lettered option. The calculation itself is robust and consistently points to 12.62.\n\n<<<C>>>"
