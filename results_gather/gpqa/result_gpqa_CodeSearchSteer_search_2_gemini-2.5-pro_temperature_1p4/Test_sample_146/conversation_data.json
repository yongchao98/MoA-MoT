    "To solve this problem, we will apply the principle of conservation of energy. The annihilation process begins with a proton ($p$) and a slowly moving antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). \"Slowly moving\" implies that the kinetic energy of the antiproton is negligible, and we can assume the proton is at rest. Therefore, the initial energy of the system is almost entirely the rest mass energy of the two particles.\n\nThe final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$, all with the same mass $m_A$. Due to the conservation of momentum, the initial momentum is approximately zero, which means the four resulting particles will be created with equal energy and will move in directions such that the total momentum remains zero.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation:\n\n**1. Determine the initial energy (E_initial):**\nThe initial energy is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton. The antiproton has the same mass as the proton. The rest mass energy of a proton is approximately 938 MeV.\n*   Rest energy of proton ($m_p c^2$): 938 MeV\n*   Rest energy of antiproton ($m_{\\bar{p}} c^2$): 938 MeV\n*   Total initial energy ($E_{initial}$): $938 \\text{ MeV} + 938 \\text{ MeV} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**2. Determine the final energy (E_final):**\nThe final state has four particles of mass $m_A$. The rest mass energy of each particle A is given as $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$. The total energy of a single moving particle A ($E_A$) is given by the relativistic energy equation $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n*   Total final energy ($E_{final}$): $4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n**3. Apply the law of conservation of energy:**\nThe total energy before the annihilation must equal the total energy after.\n*   $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n*   $1876 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times (300 \\text{ MeV})$\n\n**4. Solve for the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$):**\n*   $1876 = 1200 \\gamma$\n*   $\\gamma = \\frac{1876}{1200} \\approx 1.5633$\n\n**5. Calculate the velocity (v) of particle A:**\nThe Lorentz factor is related to velocity by the equation $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$. We can rearrange this to solve for $v/c$.\n*   $\\frac{1}{\\gamma^2} = 1 - (v/c)^2$\n*   $(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n*   $(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5633)^2} \\approx 1 - \\frac{1}{2.444} \\approx 1 - 0.409$\n*   $(v/c)^2 \\approx 0.591$\n*   $v/c = \\sqrt{0.591} \\approx 0.7688$\n\nSo, the velocity of particle A is approximately 0.77c.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0.86c\nB) 0.96c\nC) 0.91c\nD) 0.77c\n\nThe calculated velocity matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
