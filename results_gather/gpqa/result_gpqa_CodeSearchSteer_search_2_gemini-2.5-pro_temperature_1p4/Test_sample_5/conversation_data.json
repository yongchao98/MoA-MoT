    "To find the energy spectrum for a quantum mechanical particle of mass *m* in the given two-dimensional potential, we first express the potential in Cartesian coordinates.\n\nThe potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ) as:\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 kr² + 3/2 kr² cos²(θ)\n\nWe use the standard conversions from polar to Cartesian coordinates:\nx = r cos(θ)\ny = r sin(θ)\nr² = x² + y²\n\nFrom these, we can write cos²(θ) = x²/r² = x²/(x² + y²). Substituting these into the potential energy equation:\n\nV(x, y) = 1/2 k(x² + y²) + 3/2 k(x² + y²) * [x² / (x² + y²)]\nV(x, y) = 1/2 kx² + 1/2 ky² + 3/2 kx²\nV(x, y) = (1/2 + 3/2)kx² + 1/2 ky²\nV(x, y) = 2kx² + 1/2 ky²\n\nThis potential is that of a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator, which can be separated into two independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillators, one in the x-direction and one in the y-direction.\n\nThe potential for the x-direction is Vₓ(x) = 2kx² = 1/2 (4k)x².\nThe potential for the y-direction is Vᵧ(y) = 1/2 ky².\n\nThe energy of a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator is given by the formula Eₙ = (n + 1/2)ħω, where ω = sqrt(k_eff/m) is the angular frequency and *k_eff* is the effective spring constant.\n\nFor the oscillator in the x-direction:\nThe effective spring constant is kₓ = 4k.\nThe angular frequency is ωₓ = sqrt(4k/m) = 2*sqrt(k/m).\nThe energy levels are Eₙₓ = (nₓ + 1/2)ħωₓ = (nₓ + 1/2)ħ(2*sqrt(k/m)) = (2nₓ + 1)ħ*sqrt(k/m).\n\nFor the oscillator in the y-direction:\nThe effective spring constant is kᵧ = k.\nThe angular frequency is ωᵧ = sqrt(k/m).\nThe energy levels are Eₙᵧ = (nᵧ + 1/2)ħωᵧ = (nᵧ + 1/2)ħ*sqrt(k/m).\n\nThe total energy E is the sum of the energies of the two independent oscillators.\nE = Eₙₓ + Eₙᵧ\nE = (2nₓ + 1)ħ*sqrt(k/m) + (nᵧ + 1/2)ħ*sqrt(k/m)\nE = [ (2nₓ + 1) + (nᵧ + 1/2) ]ħ*sqrt(k/m)\nE = (2nₓ + nᵧ + 3/2)ħ*sqrt(k/m)\n\nHere, nₓ and nᵧ are the quantum numbers for the x and y oscillators, respectively, and can take integer values 0, 1, 2, ...\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) E = (2nₓ+3nᵧ+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nB) E = (nₓ+3*nᵧ+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nC) E = (3nₓ+2nᵧ+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nD) E = (2nₓ+nᵧ+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\n\nThe calculated energy spectrum matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
