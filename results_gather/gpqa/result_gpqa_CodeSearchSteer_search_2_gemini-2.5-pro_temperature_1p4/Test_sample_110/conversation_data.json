    "To determine the major products of the two reactions, we need to analyze each reaction mechanism, considering steric hindrance and product stability. Both reactions are examples of the Michael addition.\n\n**Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition, where a nucleophile adds to an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile is an enolate, and the α,β-unsaturated compound is ethyl acrylate.\n2.  **Enolate Formation:** The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), is strong and sterically hindered. It will deprotonate the starting ketone at an α-carbon to form an enolate.\n    *   The ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, has two α-carbons: C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is substituted with an ethyl and a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon with no protons to remove.\n    *   C6 is substituted with a methyl group and one proton.\n    *   Therefore, the enolate can only form by deprotonating C6.\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate formed at C6 will act as a nucleophile and attack the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (CH2=CH-COOEt). This is a conjugate addition. A new carbon-carbon bond will form between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n4.  **Product Structure A:** The resulting product will have the ethyl propanoate group (`-CH2CH2COOEt`) attached to the C6 carbon of the original cyclohexanone ring.\n5.  **Product Naming:** The IUPAC name given in the options can be confusing. Let's decipher the name provided in options C and D: `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n    *   This name treats the cyclohexyl ring as a substituent on the ethyl propanoate chain. The attachment point on the ring is designated C1.\n    *   Let's renumber our product according to this convention: The original C6 (the point of attack) becomes the new C1. The adjacent carbon with the ketone group (original C1) becomes C2. The next carbon (original C2) becomes C3.\n    *   With this new numbering, C1 has a methyl group and the propanoate chain attached. C2 is a ketone (=O). C3 has an ethyl group and a methyl group.\n    *   This connectivity perfectly matches the name `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`. Thus, product A is correctly named `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n\n**Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H2O)**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael addition. The nucleophile is a nitronate anion, and the acceptor is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n2.  **Nucleophile Formation:** The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), will deprotonate the acidic α-proton of 1-nitropropane (CH3CH2CH2NO2). The nitro group makes the protons on the adjacent carbon (C1) acidic, forming a nitronate anion `[CH3CH2CHNO2]−`.\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** This nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, `CH3-CH=CH-CN`).\n4.  **Product Structure B:** A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile. The structure after protonation by water is `CH3CH2-CH(NO2)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CN`.\n5.  **Product Naming:** To name this product, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The longest carbon chain including the nitrile carbon is selected as the parent chain.\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1: `NC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(CH3)(3)-CH(NO2)(4)-CH2(5)-CH3(6)`.\n    *   The parent chain is a hexanenitrile.\n    *   There is a methyl group at position C3 and a nitro group at position C4.\n    *   The correct IUPAC name for product B is `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Product A is `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n*   Product B is `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`.\n\nComparing these results with the given options, option C provides the correct names for both products A and B.\n\n<<<C>>>"
