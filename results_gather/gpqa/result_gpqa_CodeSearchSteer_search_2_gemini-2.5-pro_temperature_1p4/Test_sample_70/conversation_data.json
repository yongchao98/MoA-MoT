    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its star and its own properties. For a planet in a circular orbit around a given star, the equilibrium temperature is proportional to the inverse square root of its semi-major axis (a), assuming the planet's albedo is constant.\n    *   T_eq ∝ 1 / √a\n\n2.  **Ratio of Temperatures:** We need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 (T_4) and Planet_2 (T_2). Based on the relationship above, this ratio is:\n    *   T_4 / T_2 = (1 / √a_4) / (1 / √a_2) = √ (a_2 / a_4)\n    where a_2 and a_4 are the semi-major axes of Planet_2 and Planet_4, respectively.\n\n3.  **Kepler's Third Law:** This law relates the orbital period (P) of a planet to its semi-major axis (a). The law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis:\n    *   P² ∝ a³\n    *   This can be rearranged to express the semi-major axis in terms of the orbital period: a ∝ P^(2/3).\n\n4.  **Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:** Using the relationship from Kepler's Third Law, we can express the ratio of the semi-major axes in terms of the ratio of their orbital periods:\n    *   a_2 / a_4 = (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3)\n\n5.  **Combining the Equations:** Now, substitute the expression for the ratio of semi-major axes back into the temperature ratio equation:\n    *   T_4 / T_2 = √ [ (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3) ]\n    *   T_4 / T_2 = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)\n\n6.  **Calculating the Period Ratio:** The problem provides the ratio of the orbital periods for the five planets as 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5. From this, we can find the ratio of the period of Planet_2 (P_2) to that of Planet_4 (P_4):\n    *   P_2 / P_4 = 2 / 3.5\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:** Substitute the period ratio into the final temperature ratio equation:\n    *   T_4 / T_2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\n    *   T_4 / T_2 = (4 / 7)^(1/3)\n    *   T_4 / T_2 ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3)\n    *   T_4 / T_2 ≈ 0.8298\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.83.\n\n<<<D>>>"
