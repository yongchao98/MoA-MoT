    "To determine the number of 13C-NMR signals, we must first deduce the structure of the final product, E, by analyzing the given reaction sequence.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF3 → A**\n    This reaction forms a thioacetal. Propionaldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO) reacts with 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT) to protect the carbonyl group, yielding 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane (A). The carbon from the aldehyde group is now bonded to two sulfur atoms and retains its original ethyl group and hydrogen.\n\n2.  **Step 2: A + BuLi → B**\n    Butyllithium (BuLi) is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton in structure A. This is the proton on the carbon atom between the two sulfur atoms (C2), creating a stabilized carbanion (B), an example of umpolung (reversed polarity).\n\n3.  **Step 3: B + Bromoethane → C**\n    The carbanion (B) acts as a nucleophile and attacks bromoethane (CH₃CH₂Br) in an SN2 reaction. An ethyl group is added to the C2 carbon, which already has an ethyl group. The product (C) is 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n4.  **Step 4: C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**\n    This step is the deprotection (hydrolysis) of the thioacetal. The 1,3-dithiolane ring is removed, and the carbon atom (C2) is converted back to a carbonyl group. The resulting product (D) is 3-pentanone (diethyl ketone, (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O).\n\n5.  **Step 5: D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**\n    This is a Wittig reaction. First, the Wittig reagent is prepared from triphenylphosphine (PPh₃) and 3-bromopentane ((CH₃CH₂)₂CHBr). PPh₃ reacts with 3-bromopentane to form a phosphonium salt, which is then deprotonated by BuLi to form the ylide, (pentan-3-ylidene)triphenylphosphorane ((CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃). This ylide then reacts with the ketone from the previous step, 3-pentanone. The oxygen atom of 3-pentanone is swapped with the carbon group of the ylide.\n\n    *   Ketone (D): (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O\n    *   Ylide: (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃\n    *   Product (E): (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₃CH₂)₂\n\n    The final product (E) is **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**.\n\n**13C-NMR Analysis of 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**\n\nTo predict the number of signals in the 13C-NMR spectrum, we must analyze the symmetry of the molecule. The structure of 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene is:\n\n```\n      CH₃-CH₂     CH₂-CH₃\n               \\   /\n                C=C\n               /   \\\n      CH₃-CH₂     CH₂-CH₃\n```\n\nThe molecule is highly symmetrical. It has a C₂ axis of symmetry perpendicular to the central C=C double bond. This symmetry makes several carbon atoms chemically equivalent.\n\n*   **Alkene Carbons:** The two sp² hybridized carbons of the central double bond (C3 and C4) are equivalent due to symmetry. This will produce **one signal**.\n*   **Methylene Carbons (-CH₂-):** All four ethyl groups are equivalent. Consequently, the four methylene carbons (-CH₂) are chemically equivalent and will produce **one signal**.\n*   **Methyl Carbons (-CH₃):** Similarly, the four methyl carbons (-CH₃) at the ends of the ethyl groups are all equivalent and will result in **one signal**.\n\nTherefore, due to the high degree of symmetry in 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene, there are only three distinct types of carbon environments. This leads to a total of 3 signals in its 13C-NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<A>>>"
