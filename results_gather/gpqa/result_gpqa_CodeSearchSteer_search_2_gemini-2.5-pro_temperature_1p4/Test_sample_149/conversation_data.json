    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Identification of the Starting Material**\n\nFirst, we must identify the structure of the initial compound with the molecular formula C₈H₉NO using the provided ¹H-NMR data.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula and Unsaturation:** The molecular formula is C₈H₉NO. The degree of unsaturation is calculated as (2C + 2 + N - H)/2 = (2*8 + 2 + 1 - 9)/2 = 5. A benzene ring accounts for four degrees of unsaturation, and the remaining one likely corresponds to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This signal is in the characteristic region for an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) multiplicity indicates that it is coupled to an adjacent methylene (-CH₂-) group.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This doublet corresponds to a -CH₂- group. Its coupling to a single proton (the aldehyde proton) makes it a doublet. This confirms the presence of a phenylacetaldehyde (-CH₂CHO) fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are characteristic of a 1,4- (or para-) disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is typically an amino group (-NH₂).\n\nAssembling these pieces, the starting material is identified as **p-aminophenylacetaldehyde** (H₂N-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO). This structure is consistent with all the data.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe starting material, p-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n1.  **NaNO₂ + HCl:** These reagents are used for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The amino group (-NH₂) is converted into a diazonium salt group (-N₂⁺Cl⁻). The intermediate formed is p-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n2.  **H₂O:** Water is added to the diazonium salt. This step, often accompanied by gentle warming, causes the hydrolysis of the diazonium salt, replacing the -N₂⁺ group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group and releasing nitrogen gas. The product at this stage is **p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde** (HO-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO).\n3.  **aq. KOH, Heat:** This step involves reacting p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (KOH) and heat. Aldehydes that have α-hydrogens (hydrogens on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) undergo a self-condensation reaction under these conditions, known as the **Aldol Condensation**.\n    *   **Addition:** The base removes an α-hydrogen to form an enolate, which then attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule. This initially forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, in this case, 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal. This corresponds to option (A).\n    *   **Condensation (Dehydration):** The \"Heat\" specified in the reaction conditions promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the β-hydroxy aldehyde. This dehydration step is highly favored because it results in a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, where the new double bond is conjugated with the carbonyl group and the aromatic ring.\n    *   The dehydration of 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal yields **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This compound is a known substance.\n\n**Step 3: Identification of the Final Product**\n\nThe question asks for the final product of the entire sequence. Since the last step is an aldol reaction performed with heat, the reaction proceeds to completion through dehydration. Therefore, the final product is the condensation product, not just the initial addition product.\n\n*   **Aldol Adduct (Option A):** 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal is an intermediate that would be isolated if the reaction were performed at a low temperature without subsequent heating.\n*   **Aldol Condensation Product (Option B):** 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal is the final, dehydrated product expected when the reaction is heated.\n\nBased on this analysis, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<B>>>"
