    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the relative speed and total energy of the system.\n\n### 1. Relative Speed (v_rel)\n\nTo find the relative speed between the two astronauts, we must use the relativistic velocity addition formula, as their speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light.\n\nThe formula for the relative velocity (v_rel) between two objects moving in the same direction with velocities v₁ and v₂ is:\n\n**v_rel = (v₁ - v₂) / (1 - (v₁v₂) / c²)**\n\nGiven:\n*   Velocity of the first astronaut (v₁) = 0.6c\n*   Velocity of the second astronaut (v₂) = 0.5c\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n*   v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)\n*   v_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3c² / c²)\n*   v_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3)\n*   v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7\n*   **v_rel ≈ 0.14c**\n\n### 2. Total Energy (E)\n\nThe total energy of a single relativistic particle is given by the equation E = γmc², where γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor. The total energy of the system is the sum of the total energies of the two astronauts.\n\nThe Lorentz factor is calculated as:\n\n**γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)**\n\n**For the first astronaut (mass 2m, velocity 0.6c):**\n\n*   First, calculate his Lorentz factor (γ₁):\n    *   γ₁ = 1 / √(1 - (0.6c)²/c²)\n    *   γ₁ = 1 / √(1 - 0.36)\n    *   γ₁ = 1 / √(0.64)\n    *   γ₁ = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25\n*   Next, calculate his total energy (E₁):\n    *   E₁ = γ₁ * (2m) * c²\n    *   E₁ = 1.25 * 2mc² = 2.5 mc²\n\n**For the second astronaut (mass 3m, velocity 0.5c):**\n\n*   First, calculate his Lorentz factor (γ₂):\n    *   γ₂ = 1 / √(1 - (0.5c)²/c²)\n    *   γ₂ = 1 / √(1 - 0.25)\n    *   γ₂ = 1 / √(0.75) ≈ 1.1547\n*   Next, calculate his total energy (E₂):\n    *   E₂ = γ₂ * (3m) * c²\n    *   E₂ ≈ 1.1547 * 3mc² ≈ 3.464 mc²\n\n**Total Energy of the System (E_total):**\n\n*   E_total = E₁ + E₂\n*   E_total = 2.5 mc² + 3.464 mc²\n*   **E_total ≈ 5.96 mc²**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated relative speed is approximately **0.14c**, and the total energy of the system is approximately **5.96 mc²**. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
