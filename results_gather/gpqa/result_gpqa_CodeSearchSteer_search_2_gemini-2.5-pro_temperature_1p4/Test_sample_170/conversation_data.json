    "To arrange the given substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer during electrophilic bromination, we need to analyze the directing effects and steric hindrance of each substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n1.  **C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene)**: The methyl group (-CH₃) is an activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n2.  **C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)**: The ester group (-COOC₂H₅) is a deactivating, *meta*-director.\n3.  **C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene)**: The chloro group (-Cl) is a deactivating, *ortho, para*-director.\n4.  **C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)**: The nitro group (-NO₂) is a strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n5.  **C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)**: The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is an activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n6.  **C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid)**: The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is a deactivating, *meta*-director.\n\nThe yield of the para-isomer is primarily determined by two factors:\n*   **Directing Effect**: Substituents are classified as either *ortho, para*-directors or *meta*-directors. Meta-directing groups will produce very little para-isomer. Ortho, para-directing groups will produce significant amounts of the para-isomer.\n*   **Steric Hindrance**: For *ortho, para*-directors, a bulkier substituent will sterically hinder the attack of the electrophile (bromine) at the *ortho* positions, thus increasing the proportion of the *para*-isomer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Meta-Directors (Lowest Para Yield)**\n\nSubstances with *meta*-directing groups will have the lowest yield of the para-isomer. These are:\n*   **4) C₆H₅-NO₂**: Strongly deactivating. Nitration of nitrobenzene yields 90-95% meta-isomer, indicating a very low para yield. Bromination requires harsh conditions and primarily gives the meta product.\n*   **2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅**: Deactivating. Nitration of ethyl benzoate gives predominantly the meta-isomer (73%) with only a 5% yield of the para-isomer.\n*   **6) C₆H₅-COOH**: Deactivating. The -COOH group is a meta-director. For deactivating groups, the stronger the deactivation, the higher the selectivity for the meta position, and thus the lower the yield for the para position. The order of deactivating strength is -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅.\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield among these three is: 4 < 6 < 2.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Ortho, Para-Directors (Highest Para Yield)**\n\nSubstances with *ortho, para*-directing groups will have the highest yield of the para-isomer. These are:\n*   **1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene)**\n*   **5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)**\n*   **3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene)**\n\nTo rank these, we compare the steric hindrance of the substituents. A larger group leads to a higher para/ortho ratio.\n*   The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). Increased bulk hinders ortho attack, favoring the para position. Therefore, the para yield for ethylbenzene will be higher than for toluene. For bromination in trifluoroacetic acid, the percentage of para-isomer for ethylbenzene is 83.2%, while the percentage of ortho is 7.6%. For toluene, bromination typically yields 30-40% ortho and the rest para.\n*   Halogens like chlorine are a special case. While deactivating overall, they are *ortho, para*-directors. The bromination of chlorobenzene is highly selective for the para position, with some reports showing an ortho-to-para isomer ratio as low as 0.1 to 1 (meaning ~91% para product). In other reactions like nitration, chlorobenzene gives a 70% yield of the para-isomer. This high para selectivity is a known characteristic of halogen-substituted benzenes in electrophilic substitution.\n\nComparing the para-isomer yields:\n*   Toluene (-CH₃): ~60-67% para.\n*   Ethylbenzene (-C₂H₅): Higher para yield than toluene due to greater steric hindrance. ~83% para.\n*   Chlorobenzene (-Cl): Very high para yield, ~89-91%.\n\nThus, the order of increasing para-isomer yield among these three is: 1 < 5 < 3.\n\n**Step 3: Combine the Rankings**\n\nCombining the two groups gives the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer:\n4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
