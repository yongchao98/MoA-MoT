    "To determine the pH of the final solution, we must first calculate the moles of the acids and the base and then determine which one is in excess after neutralization.\n\n**1. Calculate Initial Moles:**\n*   **Acetic Acid (CH3COOH - a weak acid):**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.050 moles\n*   **Hydrochloric Acid (HCl - a strong acid):**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles of HCl = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = 0.080 moles\n    *   Since HCl is a strong acid, it completely dissociates, providing 0.080 moles of H⁺ ions.\n*   **Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)2 - a strong base):**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.090 moles\n    *   Since Ba(OH)2 is a strong base that releases two hydroxide ions per formula unit (Ba(OH)2 → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻), the moles of OH⁻ ions are 2 × 0.090 = 0.180 moles.\n\n**2. Neutralization Reactions:**\nThe strong base (OH⁻) will first neutralize the strong acid (H⁺ from HCl) and then the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n\n*   **Step 1: Strong Acid-Strong Base Neutralization**\n    *   Moles of H⁺ (from HCl) = 0.080 mol\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = 0.180 mol\n    *   The H⁺ ions will be completely consumed.\n    *   Remaining moles of OH⁻ = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol\n\n*   **Step 2: Weak Acid-Strong Base Neutralization**\n    *   Moles of CH3COOH = 0.050 mol\n    *   Remaining moles of OH⁻ = 0.100 mol\n    *   The CH3COOH will be completely consumed.\n    *   Final excess moles of OH⁻ = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol\n\n**3. Calculate the Final pH:**\nThe final solution contains a significant amount of excess strong base (OH⁻), which will primarily determine the pH. The presence of the acetate ion (CH3COO⁻), a weak base, is negligible in comparison.\n\n*   **Total Volume of the Solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.200 L\n*   **Concentration of Excess OH⁻:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L = 0.04167 M\n*   **Calculate pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻]\n    *   pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n*   **Calculate pH:**\n    *   The relationship between pH and pOH at 25°C is pH + pOH = 14.\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nTherefore, the pH of the solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<D>>>"
