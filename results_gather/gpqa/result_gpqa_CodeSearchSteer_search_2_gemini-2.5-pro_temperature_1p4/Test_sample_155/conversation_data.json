    "The detailed analysis of the reactions and the resulting product mixture is as follows:\n\n### Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene\n\n1.  **Epoxidation**: (E)-oct-4-ene (a trans-alkene) is treated with mCPBA. This epoxidation reaction proceeds via *syn*-addition. A *syn*-addition to a *trans*-alkene results in a racemic mixture of enantiomeric epoxides. In this case, it produces (4R,5R)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane and (4S,5S)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane.\n2.  **Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening**: The subsequent treatment with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) opens the epoxide ring via an *anti*-attack by a water molecule. The ring opening of this racemic mixture of trans-epoxides results in a single, achiral *meso* compound. For this specific reaction, the product is (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. A meso compound has stereocenters, but it is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n\n**Product of Reaction 1:** A single meso compound, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene\n\n1.  **Epoxidation**: (Z)-oct-4-ene (a cis-alkene) is treated with mCPBA. The *syn*-addition of the oxygen to a *cis*-alkene forms a *meso* epoxide, which is (4R,5S)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane.\n2.  **Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening**: The acid-catalyzed *anti*-attack of water on this meso-epoxide opens the ring to form a diol. This process results in a racemic mixture of enantiomers. The products are (4R,4R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of (4R,4R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n*   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (a meso compound from Reaction 1)\n*   (4R,4R)-octane-4,5-diol (an enantiomer from Reaction 2)\n*   (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (an enantiomer from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is that the meso compound is a diastereomer to both of the enantiomers.\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC**:\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n    *   Enantiomers, such as the (4R,4R) and (4S,5S) diols, have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will therefore co-elute as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers, such as the meso compound and the enantiomeric pair, have different physical properties and will be separated.\n    *   Therefore, the standard HPLC will show **two peaks**: one for the meso compound and one for the unresolved racemic mixture.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC**:\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase to create a chiral environment, which allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n    *   The chiral column will resolve the racemic mixture of (4R,4R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol into two separate peaks.\n    *   The meso compound is achiral and will elute as a single peak. It is a diastereomer of the other two compounds and will have a different retention time.\n    *   Consequently, the chiral HPLC will show **three peaks**: one for the meso diol, one for the (4R,4R)-diol, and one for the (4S,5S)-diol.\n\nBased on this analysis, the chemist observes 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<D>>>"
