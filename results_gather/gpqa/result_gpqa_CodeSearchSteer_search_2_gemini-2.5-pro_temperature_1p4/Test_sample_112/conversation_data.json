    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the correct chemical formula.\n\n### 1. Analysis of FTIR Data\n\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad peak centered around 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that exists as a hydrogen-bonded dimer.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, C=O stretches for carboxylic acids are typically observed between 1760-1690 cm⁻¹. The presence of both a broad O-H and a C=O stretch strongly suggests a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is in the typical range for a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, which usually occurs between 1620-1680 cm⁻¹.\n\n### 2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data\n\n*   **Presence of vinyl-hydrogens:** The ¹H NMR spectrum confirms the existence of vinyl hydrogens (protons attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond). These protons typically have chemical shifts in the range of 4.5-6.5 ppm. This corroborates the FTIR data suggesting a C=C bond.\n\n### 3. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry Data\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very common and diagnostic fragment. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group [COOH]⁺ (12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45). This fragment is frequently observed in the mass spectra of carboxylic acids and alcohols.\n\n### 4. Calculation of Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nThe spectral data indicates the presence of at least two key features that contribute to the degree of unsaturation:\n1.  A carbonyl group (C=O), which accounts for one degree of unsaturation.\n2.  A carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), which accounts for a second degree of unsaturation.\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound must have a minimum Degree of Unsaturation of 2.\n\nNow let's calculate the DoU for each of the possible formulas:\n*   **C₆H₁₂O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1\n*   **C₆H₁₀O₂:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2\n*   **C₆H₁₀O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2\n*   **C₆H₁₂O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the evidence:\n*   The combined spectroscopic evidence (FTIR, NMR, and MS) points to a molecule that is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n*   A carboxylic acid requires two oxygen atoms.\n*   The structure requires a Degree of Unsaturation of 2 (one for the C=O and one for the C=C).\n\nOnly the formula **C₆H₁₀O₂** satisfies all of these requirements: it has two oxygen atoms for the carboxylic acid group and a Degree of Unsaturation of 2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
