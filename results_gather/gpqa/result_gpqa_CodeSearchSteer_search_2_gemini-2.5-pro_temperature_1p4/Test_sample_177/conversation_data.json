    "To determine the correct option, we need to find the mass dimension of the coupling constant κ and then assess the renormalizability of the theory based on this dimension.\n\n### 1. Determining the Mass Dimension of κ\n\nIn quantum field theory (in 4-dimensional spacetime and using natural units where ħ = c = 1), the action $S = \\int d^4x \\mathcal{L}$ must be dimensionless. Since the differential volume element $d^4x$ has a mass dimension of [M]⁻⁴, the Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}$ must have a mass dimension of [M]⁴ to compensate.\n\nThe given interaction Lagrangian is:\n$\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}$\n\nThe mass dimension of this term, like any other term in the Lagrangian, must be [M]⁴. To find the dimension of κ, we first need the mass dimensions of the fields:\n\n*   **Fermion field ($\\psi$, $\\bar{\\psi}$):** The kinetic term for a fermion is $\\bar{\\psi}(i\\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu - m)\\psi$. For this term to have a mass dimension of [M]⁴, the dimension of the fermion field must be $[\\psi] = [M]^{3/2}$. Thus, $[\\bar{\\psi}] = [M]^{3/2}$ as well.\n*   **Electromagnetic field strength tensor ($F^{\\mu\\nu}$):** The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is $-\\frac{1}{4}F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$. For this term to have a mass dimension of [M]⁴, the dimension of the field strength tensor must be $[F^{\\mu\\nu}] = [M]^2$.\n*   **Sigma matrix ($\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$):** The term $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$ is defined as $\\frac{i}{2}[\\gamma_\\mu, \\gamma_\\nu]$, where the gamma matrices ($\\gamma$) are dimensionless. Therefore, $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$ is also dimensionless, i.e., $[\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}] = [M]^0$.\n\nNow, we can set up the dimensional equation for the interaction Lagrangian:\n$[\\mathcal{L}_{int}] = [\\kappa] \\cdot [\\bar{\\psi}] \\cdot [\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}] \\cdot [\\psi] \\cdot [F^{\\mu\\nu}] = [M]^4$\n\nSubstituting the known dimensions:\n$[\\kappa] \\cdot [M]^{3/2} \\cdot [M]^0 \\cdot [M]^{3/2} \\cdot [M]^2 = [M]^4$\n$[\\kappa] \\cdot [M]^{(3/2 + 3/2 + 2)} = [M]^4$\n$[\\kappa] \\cdot [M]^5 = [M]^4$\n$[\\kappa] = \\frac{[M]^4}{[M]^5} = [M]^{-1}$\n\nSo, the mass dimension of κ is -1.\n\n### 2. Renormalizability of the Theory\n\nThe renormalizability of a theory can be determined by a method called \"power counting\", which relates to the mass dimension of the coupling constants in the Lagrangian. The general rule is as follows:\n\n*   If the mass dimension of a coupling constant is **positive**, the theory is **super-renormalizable**.\n*   If the mass dimension of a coupling constant is **zero**, the theory is **renormalizable**.\n*   If the mass dimension of a coupling constant is **negative**, the theory is **non-renormalizable**.\n\nIn this case, we found that $[\\kappa] = [M]^{-1}$. Since the mass dimension of the coupling constant κ is negative, the theory is non-renormalizable. A theory with a coupling constant having a negative mass dimension will require an infinite number of counter-terms to cancel divergences that appear at higher orders of perturbation theory, which ultimately makes the theory lose its predictive power.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe mass dimension of κ is -1, and the theory is non-renormalizable. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
