    "In this problem, we are dealing with the addition of angular momentum in quantum mechanics.\n\n1.  **Identify the initial state:** The two-electron system is in a coupled angular momentum state given by `|l, m> = |2, -1>`. This means the total orbital angular momentum quantum number is `l=2`, and the quantum number for its projection on the z-axis is `m=-1`.\n\n2.  **Identify the measurement:** A measurement of the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum, `L₁z` and `L₂z`, is performed.\n\n3.  **Identify the desired outcome:** We want to find the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalue of `L₁z` to be `-ħ` (which corresponds to the magnetic quantum number `m₁ = -1`) and the eigenvalue of `L₂z` to be `-ħ` (which corresponds to `m₂ = -1`).\n\n4.  **Apply the conservation principle:** The total z-component of the angular momentum `Lz` is the sum of the individual z-components: `Lz = L₁z + L₂z`. This relationship also holds for their corresponding quantum numbers: `m = m₁ + m₂`.\n\n5.  **Check for consistency:**\n    *   The initial state `|2, -1>` is an eigenstate of the total z-component operator `Lz` with a well-defined quantum number `m = -1`.\n    *   The desired measurement outcome corresponds to `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1`.\n    *   If this outcome were possible, the total magnetic quantum number `m` for this measured state would be `m = m₁ + m₂ = (-1) + (-1) = -2`.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** There is a contradiction. The system is in a state where the total magnetic quantum number is `m = -1`. However, the desired measurement outcome corresponds to a state where the total magnetic quantum number would be `m = -2`. Because a measurement cannot change the conserved quantity of the total z-component of angular momentum, it is impossible to obtain the desired result.\n\nIn terms of state vectors, the initial state `|l=2, m=-1>` can be expanded in the uncoupled basis `|m₁, m₂>`. This expansion only contains terms for which `m₁ + m₂ = -1`. The state we are looking for, `|m₁=-1, m₂=-1>`, has `m₁ + m₂ = -2`, so its coefficient in the expansion (the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient `<1, -1, 1, -1 | 2, -1>`) is zero. The probability is the square of this coefficient, which is also zero.\n\nTherefore, the joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both `L₁z` and `L₂z` as `-ħ` is 0.\n\n<<<B>>>"
