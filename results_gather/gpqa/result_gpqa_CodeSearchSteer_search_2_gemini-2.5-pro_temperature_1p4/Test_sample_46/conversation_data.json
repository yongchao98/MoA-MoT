    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula to calculate the DoU is `C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)`.\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional degree of unsaturation, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### 2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** This pair of sharp bands is highly characteristic of the N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2).\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Given the presence of two oxygen atoms and its frequency, it is most likely an ester, as amide carbonyls typically appear at a lower frequency (around 1650-1690 cm⁻¹).\n\n### 3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to three protons is characteristic of a methyl group (-CH3) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to two protons is characteristic of a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3-). The combination of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm confirms the presence of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, such as the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH2CH3).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the protons on a primary amine (-NH2). This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are the classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n\n### 4. Assembling the Structure\nBased on the analysis:\n*   We have an ethyl group attached to an ester oxygen: **-COOCH2CH3**.\n*   We have a primary amine group: **-NH2**.\n*   We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\nCombining these fragments leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n### 5. Verifying the Structure and Evaluating Options\nLet's confirm if ethyl 4-aminobenzoate matches the data and why other options are incorrect.\n\n*   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** (CH3CH2CO-O-C6H4-NH2). This has an -NH2 group and a para-substituted ring, but it's a propionate ester. The NMR would show a quartet for the -CO-CH2- protons around 2.2-2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** (CH3CH2O-C6H4-CONH2). The IR C=O stretch for an amide is incorrect. The aromatic substitution is meta (1,3), which would not produce two clean doublets in the NMR.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** (H-CO-NH-C6H4-OCH2CH3). This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H band in the IR, not two.\n*   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** (H2N-C6H4-COOCH2CH3).\n    *   **Formula (C9H11NO2):** Matches.\n    *   **IR:** Contains a primary amine (-NH2) and an ester carbonyl (-C=O), matching the bands at 3420/3325 cm⁻¹ and 1720 cm⁻¹.\n    *   **¹H NMR:**\n        *   An ethyl group attached to the ester oxygen gives a triplet around 1.35 ppm and a quartet around 4.31 ppm. This is very close to the given values of 1.20 and 4.5 ppm.\n        *   A primary amine group gives a broad singlet around 4.16 ppm, matching the given 4.0 ppm.\n        *   A 1,4-disubstituted ring with an amino group (electron-donating) and an ethyl ester group (electron-withdrawing) gives two doublets. The protons next to the amino group appear upfield (~6.6 ppm) and the protons next to the ester appear downfield (~7.8 ppm), which is consistent with the provided data of 7.0 and 8.0 ppm.\n\nAll evidence conclusively points to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<D>>>"
