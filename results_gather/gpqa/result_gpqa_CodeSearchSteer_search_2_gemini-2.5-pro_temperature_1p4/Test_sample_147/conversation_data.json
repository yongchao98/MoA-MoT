    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y and Compound A2:**\n    The key information is that compound A2 has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. The general formula for a binary fluoride is YF_n.\n    The formula for mass percentage is: ɷF = (n * M_F) / (M_Y + n * M_F), where M_Y is the molar mass of element Y and M_F is the molar mass of fluorine (~19.00 g/mol).\n    Rearranging for M_Y: M_Y = (n * M_F / ɷF) - (n * M_F) = n * M_F * (1/ɷF - 1).\n    Plugging in the values: M_Y = n * 19.00 * (1/0.3196 - 1) = n * 19.00 * (3.129 - 1) = n * 40.45.\n    We can now test integer values for 'n':\n    *   If n = 1, M_Y ≈ 40.45 g/mol (similar to Calcium, which doesn't fit the other clues).\n    *   If n = 2, M_Y ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is very close to the atomic mass of Krypton (Kr, M ≈ 83.8 g/mol). Let's check the actual mass percentage for KrF₂: ɷF = (2 * 19.00) / (83.8 + 38.00) = 38 / 121.8 ≈ 31.2%. This is reasonably close to the given 31.96%.\n    *   If n = 3, M_Y ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is very close to Antimony (Sb, M ≈ 121.76 g/mol). The mass percentage for SbF₃ is ɷF = (3 * 19.00) / (121.76 + 57.00) = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 31.88%. This is an even better match.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Candidates Y=Kr and Y=Sb using other clues:**\n    *   **Clue:** \"The bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K (20 °C) into A2 and fluorine. A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions.\"\n    *   If Y = Sb, A2 would be SbF₃. A1 would have to be a higher fluoride, i.e., SbF₅. However, SbF₅ is a colorless, stable liquid, not a bright-red solid that decomposes at room temperature. Also, while SbF₅ is a strong Lewis acid, its ability to oxidize Xenon under normal conditions is not its most defining characteristic in the way it is for other compounds. This path seems unlikely.\n    *   If Y = Kr, A2 would be KrF₂. A1 would be a higher fluoride, KrF₄.\n        *   **Decomposition:** KrF₄ is known to be extremely unstable and decomposes rapidly at room temperature (293 K) into KrF₂ and F₂. This fits the description perfectly.\n        *   **Oxidizing Power:** Krypton compounds are exceptionally powerful oxidizing agents. KrF₂ itself can oxidize xenon. The KrF⁺ cation, which could be formed from KrF₂, is one of the strongest known oxidizers and readily oxidizes xenon. A higher fluoride like KrF₄ would therefore certainly oxidize xenon. This fits.\n        *   **Color:** The only inconsistency is the color. KrF₄ is described as a white solid, not \"bright-red\". Given that all other chemical properties strongly point to Krypton, the color description in the problem is likely an error.\n\n3.  **Confirm Identity of A3:**\n    *   \"A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine.\"\n    *   Fluorination of Krypton produces Krypton difluoride (KrF₂). KrF₂ is known to react with (oxidize) xenon. So, A3 = KrF₂. This is consistent with our assignment.\n\n4.  **Identify the Compounds and Determine the Molecular Weight of A4:**\n    *   So far, we have identified Y = Krypton, A1 = KrF₄, and A2 = A3 = KrF₂.\n    *   Let's calculate their molecular weights:\n        *   M(KrF₂) = 83.8 + 2 * 19.0 = 121.8 g/mol.\n        *   M(KrF₄) = 83.8 + 4 * 19.0 = 159.8 g/mol.\n    *   The problem asks for the molecular weight range of substance A4. The remaining clues describe a reaction involving A4 to produce A5. This reaction (\"adding Y...to...solution of A4\") seems chemically implausible as written and may be a red herring.\n    *   However, the question presents four molecular weight ranges, two of which correspond perfectly to the compounds we have identified:\n        *   **A) 110-130:** Contains M(KrF₂) = 121.8 g/mol.\n        *   **D) 140-160:** Contains M(KrF₄) = 159.8 g/mol.\n    *   The problem introduces A1 and A4 as distinct entities in the narrative. A1 is defined by its decomposition. A4 is defined as a reactant in a solution. Since A1 has been identified as KrF₄, it is logical to assume that A4 is the other major fluoride of krypton, which is KrF₂.\n\nTherefore, A4 is KrF₂, and its molecular weight is ~121.8 g/mol, which falls into the range 110-130.\n\n<<<A>>>"
