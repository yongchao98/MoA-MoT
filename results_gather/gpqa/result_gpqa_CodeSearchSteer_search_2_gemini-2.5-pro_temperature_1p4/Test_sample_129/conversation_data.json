    "To estimate the lower limit on the redshift for detecting Lyman-alpha absorption from ground-based optical telescopes, we need to consider two main factors: the rest wavelength of the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) line and the atmospheric cutoff wavelength for ground-based observatories.\n\n1.  **Lyman-alpha Wavelength:** The Lyα transition of neutral hydrogen has a rest wavelength of approximately 1216 Å (or more precisely, 1215.67 Å). This wavelength is in the far-ultraviolet (FUV) part of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\n2.  **Atmospheric Cutoff:** Earth's atmosphere, primarily due to ozone (O3), absorbs most of the incoming ultraviolet radiation. Ground-based optical telescopes can effectively observe at wavelengths longer than this atmospheric cutoff. The cutoff is not perfectly sharp, but significant atmospheric absorption makes observations below about 3200-3300 Å very difficult. For practical purposes in spectroscopy, the observable window starts around 3300-3600 Å.\n\n3.  **Redshift Calculation:** The redshift `z` relates the emitted wavelength (λ_emitted) to the observed wavelength (λ_observed) by the formula:\n\n    `1 + z = λ_observed / λ_emitted`\n\nTo find the minimum redshift (`z_min`), we need the observed wavelength to be just above the atmospheric cutoff. Let's use a conservative cutoff value of ~3600 Å for efficient ground-based observations of faint quasar absorption lines.\n\nUsing the values:\n*   λ_emitted ≈ 1216 Å\n*   λ_observed (min) ≈ 3600 Å\n\nWe can calculate the minimum redshift:\n\n`1 + z_min = 3600 Å / 1216 Å`\n`1 + z_min ≈ 2.96`\n`z_min ≈ 1.96`\n\nTherefore, a redshift of around 1.9 to 2.0 is required to shift the 1216 Å Lyman-alpha line into the visible part of the spectrum accessible from the ground. This aligns with observations, which state that the Lyman-alpha forest is readily accessible with ground-based telescopes at redshifts greater than 2. Below this, space-based UV spectrographs are necessary.\n\nComparing this calculated value with the given options:\n\n*   A) 2.4\n*   B) 1.9\n*   C) 1.2\n*   D) 3\n\nThe calculated value of ~1.96 is closest to 1.9.\n\n<<<B>>>"
