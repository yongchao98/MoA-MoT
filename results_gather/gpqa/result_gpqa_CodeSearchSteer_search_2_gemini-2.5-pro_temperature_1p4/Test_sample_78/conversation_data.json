    "An analysis of the provided ¹H-NMR and ¹³C-NMR spectra allows for the determination of the product's structure.\n\n**Product Structure Analysis from NMR Data:**\n\n*   **¹³C-NMR Spectrum:** The signal at δ 197.7 ppm is characteristic of a ketone carbonyl carbon. The signals at δ 21.3 ppm and δ 28.4 ppm correspond to two distinct methyl groups. The remaining signals are in the aromatic/vinylic region (δ 126.9 - 144.1 ppm).\n*   **¹H-NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The two singlets at δ 2.28 (3H) and δ 2.31 (3H) confirm the presence of two methyl groups that are not coupled to any protons. One is likely an acetyl methyl group (-CO-CH₃), and the other is attached to a quaternary carbon, most likely an aromatic ring.\n    *   The pair of doublets at δ 7.08 (2H) and δ 7.71 (2H) is a classic pattern for a para-substituted benzene ring. The methyl singlet at δ 2.31 ppm is consistent with a methyl group on this ring, forming a p-tolyl group.\n    *   The two doublets at δ 6.75 (1H) and δ 7.68 (1H) are indicative of two protons on a carbon-carbon double bond that are coupled to each other, characteristic of a trans-alkene.\n*   **Assembling the Product Structure:** Based on these fragments (a ketone, a p-tolyl group, a trans-disubstituted double bond, and an acetyl methyl group), the only structure that fits is **(E)-4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one**, also known as p-methylbenzylideneacetone. Its structure is `p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CO-CH₃`.\n    *   Let's verify this structure against the provided data:\n        *   Formula: C₁₁H₁₂O. This matches the starting material.\n        *   Two methyl singlets: One for the p-tolyl group and one for the acetyl group. This matches δ 2.28 and δ 2.31.\n        *   Para-substituted ring protons and vinylic protons: The two doublets for the p-tolyl ring and the two doublets for the trans -CH=CH- group match the remaining signals.\n        *   The 9 unique carbon signals are consistent with the proposed structure's symmetry.\n\n**Reaction Analysis:**\n\nThe reaction involves heating a compound (Compound X) with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO), a non-nucleophilic base, in a nonpolar solvent. The starting material is an epoxide, as indicated by the options. This set of conditions is characteristic of a base-mediated Meinwald rearrangement of a vinyl epoxide to an α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n\n**Identifying Compound X:**\n\nWe need to find which of the starting materials would rearrange to form (E)-4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n\n*   **A) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** The formula is C₁₁H₁₂O, but the carbon skeleton is branched and would not rearrange to the linear chain of the product.\n*   **B) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:**\n    *   The \"styryl\" group is `C₆H₅-CH=CH-`. A \"4-methylstyryl\" group is `p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-`.\n    *   Attaching this to position 2 of an oxirane ring gives the structure: `p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂`.\n    *   The molecular formula is C₁₁H₁₂O, which is correct.\n    *   The Meinwald rearrangement of this specific type of vinyl epoxide is known to yield an α,β-unsaturated methyl ketone. The reaction proceeds by converting the terminal vinyl epoxide into the corresponding methyl ketone, which perfectly matches the identified product.\n*   **C) 2-styrylepoxide:** The formula is C₁₀H₁₀O, which is incorrect.\n*   **D) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** This would be `C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(O)CH(CH₃)`. The formula is C₁₂H₁₄O, which is incorrect. Furthermore, as an internal epoxide, it would not yield the specific methyl ketone product observed.\n\nTherefore, Compound X must be 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane, as it is the only option with the correct molecular formula and structure to produce (E)-4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one under the given reaction conditions.\n\n<<<B>>>"
