    "Here is an analysis of each option to determine which exoplanet has the highest density:\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This planet would have a density identical to that of Earth, which is approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is explicitly stated as being about 5.5 g/cm³, which is very close to Earth's density.\n\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** Due to its greater mass, this planet would experience stronger gravitational compression. Gravity acting on an object's mass compresses it, which reduces its size and increases its density. Therefore, a planet with five times the mass of Earth but the same composition will be compressed more than Earth, resulting in a higher density. Studies of rocky exoplanets show that for planets with a radius up to about 1.5 times that of Earth, their density tends to increase as the radius and mass grow, due to this gravitational compression.\n\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** With less mass, this planet would be subject to weaker gravitational compression compared to Earth. As a result, its density would be lower than Earth's.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nComparing the options, the planet described in (c) will have the highest density. The significant increase in mass leads to greater self-gravity, which compacts the material more tightly than in the other scenarios.\n\n<<<D>>>"
