    "The reasoning behind the solution is consistent and supported by established chemical principles. Here is a summary of the logical steps taken:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z**: Substance Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This percentage corresponds to the general formula CnH2n. Since Z does not react further with hydrogen and is used as a solvent, it is identified as the saturated cycloalkane, cyclohexane (C6H12). The hydrogenation of benzene is a common industrial method to produce cyclohexane.\n\n2.  **Identify Mixture Y**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water and contains Z. Hydrogenation of mixture Y yields only Z (cyclohexane). This indicates the other component must also have a six-carbon ring structure that hydrogenates to cyclohexane. The prime candidate that fits these criteria is benzene (C6H6). Benzene's aromaticity makes it stable, and it does not react with bromine water under normal conditions. Hydrogenation of benzene does produce cyclohexane. Therefore, mixture Y consists of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction X to Y**: An equimolar mixture X is converted into an equimolar mixture Y via a platinum-catalyzed disproportionation reaction. The overall reaction can be written as:\n    Component A₁ (from X) + Component A₂ (from X) → Benzene (C6H6) + Cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    This is a hydrogen transfer reaction where one component is dehydrogenated to benzene, and the other is hydrogenated to cyclohexane. By the law of conservation of mass, the total number of hydrogen atoms from the two components of X must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n    Total H atoms = H atoms in Benzene + H atoms in Cyclohexane = 6 + 12 = 18.\n\n4.  **Characterize Mixture X**: Mixture X consists of two liquids that decolorize bromine water, which confirms they are unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds). Upon hydrogenation, both components yield cyclohexane, confirming they are C6 cyclic compounds. The problem states there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of mixture X.\n\n5.  **Identify Components of X**: Based on the criteria for X, we look for non-conjugated C6 cycloalkenes or cycloalkadienes.\n    *   Cyclohexene (C6H10) is a C6 cycloalkene.\n    *   Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8) is a C6 cycloalkadiene with non-conjugated double bonds. Cyclohexa-1,3-diene is a conjugated isomer and is thus excluded.\n    The disproportionation reaction where one molecule acts as a hydrogen donor and the other as an acceptor is well-documented, particularly for cyclohexadienes and related compounds, often referred to as Zelinsky irreversible catalysis. The most plausible reaction is the transfer of hydrogen from cyclohexa-1,4-diene to cyclohexene:\n    C6H8 (cyclohexa-1,4-diene) + C6H10 (cyclohexene) → C6H6 (benzene) + C6H12 (cyclohexane).\n    The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component of mixture X is 8 + 10 = 18. This matches the calculation from step 3.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This refers to the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each of the two different compounds.\n\n*   Liquid 1: Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)\n*   Liquid 2: Cyclohexene (C6H10)\n*   Total hydrogen atoms = 8 + 10 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
