    "The reaction described is a classic Diels-Alder cycloaddition.\n\n1.  **Identifying the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dienophile:** A dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated to an anhydride. The resulting anhydride shows a single peak for its protons (¹H NMR at 7 ppm) and only two peaks for its carbons (¹³C NMR at 137 ppm for the alkene carbons and 165 ppm for the carbonyl carbons). This high degree of symmetry confirms the anhydride is **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene with four methyl groups on the four carbons of the diene system and a CH₂ group at the 5th position.\n\n2.  **The Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction between 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene and maleic anhydride yields a bicyclic adduct.\n    *   Due to the \"endo rule\" in Diels-Alder reactions, two stereoisomers are typically formed: the *endo* product (major) and the *exo* product (minor). The endo-isomer is favored because of stabilizing secondary orbital interactions between the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile and the newly forming double bond of the diene in the transition state.\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Analysis and Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The problem states that a cross-peak is observed in the 2D NOESY spectrum of the major product but is absent in the minor product. NOESY shows correlations between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å), regardless of whether they are connected by bonds. This technique is ideal for distinguishing between *endo* and *exo* isomers.\n    *   Let's analyze the expected proton signals and their spatial relationships in both isomers:\n        *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** These are the two equivalent methine protons (CH) on the part of the molecule that came from maleic anhydride. They are alpha to the carbonyl groups, hence their downfield shift.\n        *   **Two 6H singlets at ~1.7 ppm and ~1.0 ppm:** These correspond to the four methyl groups. The two methyl groups on the double bond of the product are vinylic and appear at a lower field (~1.7 ppm). The other two methyl groups are on the bridgehead carbons and appear at a higher field (~1.0 ppm).\n        *   **A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This is one of the two protons on the C7 methylene bridge (the CH₂ group from the original diene). These two protons are non-equivalent. The key to distinguishing the isomers is their proximity to other protons.\n    *   **Major (Endo) Product:** The anhydride ring is tucked *under* the larger bridge, on the same side (*syn*) as the C7 methylene bridge. This geometry brings the methine protons from the anhydride (~3.5 ppm) close to the C7 bridge protons (~1.5 ppm).\n    *   **Minor (Exo) Product:** The anhydride ring points away from the C7 methylene bridge. In this arrangement, the methine protons from the anhydride are far from the C7 bridge protons.\n    *   Therefore, a NOESY cross-peak between the methine protons from the anhydride and a C7 bridge proton is expected to be present and strong for the *endo* (major) product and absent or very weak for the *exo* (minor) product.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The cross-peak that is present in the major product and absent in the minor product connects the two sets of protons that are uniquely close in the *endo* configuration. This corresponds to the interaction between the anhydride methine protons and the C7 bridge protons.\n\nThe correct choice is the one that connects the resonances for the anhydride methine protons (2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm) and a C7 bridge proton (1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm).\n\n<<<A>>>"
