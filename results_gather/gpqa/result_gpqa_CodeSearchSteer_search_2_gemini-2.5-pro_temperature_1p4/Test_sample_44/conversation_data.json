    "Here is a step-by-step calculation for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\nThe energy for a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L is given by:\nE_n = n² * (π²ħ² / 2mL²) = n²E, where n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nThe particles are spin-1/2 fermions, which means they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. Since the particles have spin, each energy level 'n' can accommodate two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n### Ground State Energy\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest energy levels first.\n*   We place two particles in the n=1 energy level (one spin up, one spin down). The energy for these two particles is 2 * E₁ = 2 * (1²E) = 2E.\n*   We then place the remaining two particles in the next lowest energy level, n=2 (one spin up, one spin down). The energy for these two particles is 2 * E₂ = 2 * (2²E) = 8E.\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\nE_ground = 2E + 8E = 10E.\n\n### First Excited State Energy\n\nTo get the first excited state, we promote one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n*   The ground state configuration has particles in n=1 and n=2.\n*   We move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n*   The new configuration is: two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n\nThe total energy for the first excited state is:\nE_1st = (2 * E₁) + (1 * E₂) + (1 * E₃) = (2 * 1²E) + (1 * 2²E) + (1 * 3²E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.\n\n### Second Excited State Energy\n\nFor the second excited state, we need to consider the next possible excitation with the lowest energy increase from the ground state. There are a few possibilities:\n1.  Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4 (from the ground state configuration).\n    *   Configuration: two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4.\n    *   Energy = (2 * 1²E) + (1 * 2²E) + (1 * 4²E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n2.  Promote two particles from n=2 to n=3 (from the ground state configuration).\n    *   Configuration: two in n=1, two in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (2 * 1²E) + (2 * 3²E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n3.  Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3 (from the ground state configuration).\n    *   Configuration: one in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (1 * 1²E) + (2 * 2²E) + (1 * 3²E) = E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n\nComparing these energies (22E, 20E, and 18E), the lowest energy above the first excited state (15E) is 18E. Therefore, the energy of the second excited state is 18E.\n\nThe energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are 10E, 15E, and 18E, respectively.\n\n<<<D>>>"
