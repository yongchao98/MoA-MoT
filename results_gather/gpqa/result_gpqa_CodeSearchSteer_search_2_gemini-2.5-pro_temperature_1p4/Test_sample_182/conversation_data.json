    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Structure and Formula of the Reactant\n\nThe starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Cyclohex-3-ene**: A six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between C3 and C4.\n*   **-carboxylic acid**: A -COOH group is attached to C1 of the ring.\n*   **2-formyl**: A -CHO group is attached to C2 of the ring.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A -CH=CH₂ group is attached to C5 of the ring.\n\nBased on this structure, the molecular formula is C₁₀H₁₂O₃.\n\nLet's verify the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) for the reactant to confirm its structure.\nThe IHD is calculated by the formula: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2), ignoring oxygen atoms.\nIHD (reactant) = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 11 - 6 = 5.\n\nThis IHD of 5 corresponds to:\n*   1 for the ring structure.\n*   1 for the double bond in the cyclohexene ring.\n*   1 for the double bond in the vinyl group.\n*   1 for the C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid.\n*   1 for the C=O double bond in the formyl group.\nThe calculation confirms the structure is correct.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Reaction and the Product\n\nThe reactant is treated with red phosphorus (P) and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination is a powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce most oxygen-containing functional groups, as well as carbon-carbon multiple bonds, to alkanes.\n\nThe reaction will proceed as follows:\n*   The **carboxylic acid group** (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The **formyl group** (-CHO) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The **vinyl group** (-CH=CH₂) is reduced to an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n*   The **carbon-carbon double bond** within the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a single bond.\n\nTherefore, the starting molecule is completely reduced to a substituted cyclohexane. The final product is 5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Molecular Formula of the Product\n\nThe product is 5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane. Let's find its molecular formula:\n*   **Cyclohexane ring**: C₆H₁₂.\n*   Three hydrogens on the ring are substituted with:\n    *   One methyl group (-CH₃)\n    *   Another methyl group (-CH₃)\n    *   One ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)\n*   **Total carbons**: 6 (from ring) + 1 (from first methyl) + 1 (from second methyl) + 2 (from ethyl) = 10 carbons.\n*   **Total hydrogens**: A saturated acyclic alkane with 10 carbons has the formula C₁₀H₂₂. Since the product has one ring, two hydrogens are subtracted. Thus, the formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (also known as degrees of unsaturation) indicates the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule.\n\nThe IHD can be determined from the molecular formula C₁₀H₂₀:\n*   IHD = (2C + 2 - H) / 2\n*   IHD = (2 * 10 + 2 - 20) / 2\n*   IHD = (20 + 2 - 20) / 2\n*   IHD = 2 / 2 = 1\n\nAlternatively, the IHD can be found by inspecting the structure of the product, 5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane. The molecule consists of a single cyclohexane ring and contains no double or triple bonds. A ring counts as one degree of unsaturation.\n\nTherefore, the index of hydrogen deficiency of the final product is 1.\n\n<<<A>>>"
