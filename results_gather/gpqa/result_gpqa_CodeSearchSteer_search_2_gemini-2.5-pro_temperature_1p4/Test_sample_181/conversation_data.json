    "The Mott-Gurney equation is a fundamental relationship in semiconductor physics that describes the current-voltage characteristics of a device operating in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. The validity of this equation rests on several key assumptions about the device's properties and the nature of charge transport.\n\nThe equation is valid for a **single-carrier device**, meaning that the current is predominantly carried by either electrons or holes, not both. This rules out applicability to two-carrier (bipolar) devices.\n\nA crucial condition is that the semiconductor must be considered **trap-free**. The presence of traps, which are energy states within the bandgap that can capture charge carriers, would alter the J-V relationship and require a modified model.\n\nFurthermore, the electrical contacts to the semiconductor must be **Ohmic**. An ideal Ohmic contact presents no barrier to the injection of charge carriers into the semiconductor. This is in contrast to a Schottky contact, which forms a rectifying barrier. Therefore, the condition of having no carrier injection barrier is synonymous with having an Ohmic contact.\n\nFinally, the derivation of the Mott-Gurney law assumes that the **diffusion current is negligible** compared to the drift current. The current is considered to be driven by the electric field (drift) and not by the concentration gradient of charge carriers (diffusion).\n\nAnalyzing the given options:\n*   **A)** is incorrect because the Mott-Gurney equation describes a drift-dominated current; therefore, the drift current is not negligible.\n*   **B)** is incorrect because a Schottky contact implies a carrier injection barrier, which violates the assumptions of the model.\n*   **D)** is incorrect because the equation applies to single-carrier devices, not two-carrier devices.\n*   **C)** correctly states all the key conditions: a trap-free material, a single type of charge carrier, no injection barrier (which implies an Ohmic contact), and negligible diffusion current.\n\n<<<C>>>"
