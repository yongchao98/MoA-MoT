    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of product 3 and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n**Step 1: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid, forming product 1.**\n\nThis reaction is the electrophilic aromatic substitution (nitration) of toluene. The combination of nitric acid (HNO₃) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) generates the nitronium ion (NO₂⁺), which is the electrophile. The methyl group (-CH₃) on toluene is an ortho-, para-director. This means the nitro group will primarily be added at the ortho (2) and para (4) positions. Due to steric hindrance, the para-isomer is the major product.\n\n*   **Product 1:** p-nitrotoluene (4-nitrotoluene).\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is treated with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄, forming product 2.**\n\nThis step involves the oxidation of p-nitrotoluene. Manganese dioxide (MnO₂) in the presence of sulfuric acid is an oxidizing agent. While strong oxidizing agents can convert the methyl group to a carboxylic acid, MnO₂ with sulfuric acid is often used for the milder oxidation of toluenes to their corresponding aldehydes. The subsequent reaction step strongly suggests that an aldehyde is formed here.\n\n*   **Product 2:** p-nitrobenzaldehyde (4-nitrobenzaldehyde).\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide, forming product 3.**\n\nThis reaction is a base-catalyzed crossed aldol condensation, specifically a Claisen-Schmidt condensation. In this reaction, an aromatic aldehyde (p-nitrobenzaldehyde) which cannot enolize reacts with an enolizable ketone (acetone) in the presence of a base (NaOH).\n1.  Sodium hydroxide removes an acidic α-hydrogen from acetone to form an enolate ion.\n2.  The acetone enolate attacks the carbonyl carbon of p-nitrobenzaldehyde.\n3.  The resulting aldol addition product readily undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule) because the resulting double bond is in conjugation with both the aromatic ring and the carbonyl group, which leads to a highly stable product.\n\n*   **Product 3:** (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one. The E-isomer (trans) is favored due to lower steric hindrance.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the molecular symmetry group of product 3.**\n\nThe structure of product 3 is (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one. To determine its point group, we must identify its symmetry elements.\n\n*   **Structure:** p-NO₂-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃\n*   The molecule has a planar framework consisting of the benzene ring and the enone system (-CH=CH-C=O).\n*   **Rotational Axes (Cn):** The molecule does not possess any C₂, C₃, or higher-order rotational axes.\n*   **Center of Inversion (i):** There is no center of inversion.\n*   **Mirror Planes (σ):** Assuming the main framework of the molecule is planar, the plane of the molecule itself acts as a mirror plane of symmetry (σ). For this to be true, for every atom above the plane, there must be a corresponding atom below the plane. The hydrogens of the methyl group can be arranged such that one is in the plane and the other two are symmetrically positioned above and below it. Therefore, the molecule has a single plane of symmetry.\n\nA molecule that possesses only the identity element (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ) belongs to the **Cₛ** point group.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\n*   A) C₃: Incorrect. No C₃ axis.\n*   B) D₂h: Incorrect. Requires much higher symmetry.\n*   C) Cₛ: Correct. Possesses one mirror plane.\n*   D) C₂h: Incorrect. Requires a C₂ axis and a center of inversion.\n\n<<<C>>>"
