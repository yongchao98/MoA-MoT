    "The problem of determining the potential energy of a point charge near a grounded conducting sphere is a classic exercise in electrostatics, solved using the method of image charges.\n\n### The Method of Images\n\nTo solve this problem, the complex electric field produced by the charge `q` and the induced charges on the surface of the grounded sphere is simplified. The system of the real charge and the grounded sphere is replaced by an equivalent system of the real charge `q` and a fictitious \"image charge\" `q'`. For this equivalence to hold, the potential on the surface of the sphere must be zero, which is the condition for a grounded conductor.\n\nFor a point charge `q` located a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` is:\n\n*   **Magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Location:** Placed at a distance `b = R^2/d` from the center of the sphere, along the line connecting the center to the charge `q`.\n\n### Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from an infinite distance away to the distance `d` from the center of the sphere. This work is done against the attractive force between the charge `q` and the induced charge on the sphere (or, equivalently, the image charge `q'`).\n\nThe potential energy `U` can be calculated as half of the interaction energy between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`. The factor of 1/2 is crucial because it accounts for the fact that the induced charge distribution's own energy is included in the work calculation.\n\n1.  **Potential at `q` due to `q'`:** The potential `V'` at the location of the real charge `q` created by the image charge `q'` is:\n    *   The distance between `q` and `q'` is `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`.\n    *   `V' = k * q' / (d - b) = k * [-q(R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\n    *   `V' = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n2.  **Potential Energy of the System:** The total potential energy `U` is half the product of the real charge `q` and the potential `V'` created by the image charge.\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * V'`\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    *   `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThis formula shows that the potential energy is negative, which is expected because the force between the positive charge `q` and the induced negative charge on the grounded sphere is attractive. The system is in a bound state, and energy would need to be supplied to separate the charge from the sphere.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\n\nA) `U = -(1/2) * k*q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\nB) `U = -k*q^2 * d / (d^2 - R^2)`\nC) `U = -(1/2) * k*q^2 * R^2 / (d^2 - R^2)`\nD) `U = -(1/2) * k*q^2 * d / (d^2 + R^2)`\n\nThe calculated formula matches option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>"
