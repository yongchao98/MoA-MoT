    "To determine the two compounds present in the 1:1 mixture, we must analyze the expected 1H NMR spectra of each of the four options and see which combination matches the provided spectral data.\n\nThe molecular formula for all candidate compounds is C10H14. The experimental spectrum shows:\n*   **Aromatic region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Alkyl region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\nLet's analyze the expected spectrum for each compound:\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** Due to its high symmetry, there is one type of aromatic proton and one type of methyl group.\n    *   Aromatic protons: The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent and have no adjacent protons, resulting in a single **2H singlet**.\n    *   Alkyl protons: The four methyl groups are equivalent, resulting in a single **12H singlet**.\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 atoms.\n    *   Aromatic protons: The protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. They have no adjacent protons, giving a single **2H singlet**.\n    *   Alkyl protons: There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        *   The two methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique (3H).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique (3H).\n        *   This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** The two aromatic protons at positions 5 and 6 are adjacent to each other. This adjacency would lead to spin-spin coupling, producing a multiplet (likely a set of doublets), not a singlet. Therefore, this compound can be ruled out.\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:** The alkyl portion consists of ethyl groups. These would produce a triplet (from the -CH3 group) and a quartet (from the -CH2 group) due to coupling. The problem states there are only singlets in the alkyl region, so this compound can also be ruled out.\n\n**Combining the Spectra:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the only possible compounds are **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**, which corresponds to option D. Let's verify if a 1:1 mixture of these two would produce the observed spectrum.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives a 2H singlet, and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene also gives a 2H singlet. In a mixture, these would appear at slightly different chemical shifts, resulting in **two 2H singlets**. For a 1:1 molar mixture, the integration ratio of these two signals would be **1:1**, which matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region:** The total number of alkyl protons in the 1:1 mixture is 12 from durene and 12 from isodurene, for a total of 24. The observed 2:1:1 ratio means the signals integrate to 12H, 6H, and 6H, respectively (since 2x + 1x + 1x = 24, so x=6).\n    *   The **12H singlet** comes from the four equivalent methyl groups of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene**.\n    *   The **6H singlet** comes from the two equivalent C1 and C3 methyl groups of **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**.\n    *   The second **6H singlet** arises from the accidental overlap (degeneracy) of the signals from the unique C2 (3H) and C5 (3H) methyl groups of **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**.\nThis combination perfectly explains the three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nTherefore, the two compounds in the mixture are 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<D>>>"
