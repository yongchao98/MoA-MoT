    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Determine the Masses of the Fragments and the Q-value\n\nFirst, we establish the rest-mass energies of the initial nucleus and the two resulting fragments.\n\n*   **Initial Nucleus (M):** The rest-mass energy is given as M*c² = 300 GeV.\n*   **Fragments (m1 and m2):**\n    *   The sum of their rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M. This means their combined rest-mass energy is (m1+m2)*c² = 0.99 * (M*c²) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV.\n    *   One fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let m1 be the more massive fragment, so m1 = 2*m2.\n*   **Solving for individual fragment energies:**\n    *   We have m1*c² = 2 * (m2*c²).\n    *   Substituting this into the sum: 2*(m2*c²) + m2*c² = 297 GeV.\n    *   This gives 3*(m2*c²) = 297 GeV, so the rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment is **m2*c² = 99 GeV**.\n    *   The rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment is **m1*c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV**.\n\nThe total kinetic energy (Q-value) released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy.\n\n*   **Q-value =** 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = **3 GeV**.\n\nThis 3 GeV is distributed as kinetic energy between the two fragments: T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.\n\n### 2. Classical (Non-Relativistic) Calculation of T1\n\nIn classical mechanics, the kinetic energy is given by T = p² / (2m), where p is the momentum. Due to the conservation of momentum, the fragments fly apart with equal and opposite momenta. Therefore, the magnitude of their momenta is the same (p1 = p2 = p).\n\n*   From T = p² / (2m), we can see that kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass: T₁/T₂ = m₂/m₁.\n*   Since m₁ = 2m₂, we have T₁/T₂ = m₂/(2m₂) = 1/2, which means T₂ = 2T₁.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy: T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV.\n*   Substituting T₂: T₁ + 2T₁ = 3 GeV.\n*   3T₁ = 3 GeV, which gives the classical kinetic energy **T1_classical = 1 GeV**.\n\n### 3. Correct (Relativistic) Calculation of T1\n\nFor the relativistic calculation, we use the energy-momentum relation: E² = (pc)² + (mc²)², where E is the total energy (rest-mass energy + kinetic energy).\n\n*   Momentum conservation (p1 = p2 = p) still holds.\n*   We can write (pc)² for each fragment:\n    *   (pc)² = E₁² - (m₁c²)²\n    *   (pc)² = E₂² - (m₂c²)²\n*   Therefore, E₁² - (m₁c²)² = E₂² - (m₂c²)².\n*   Total energy is conserved. The total final energy (E₁ + E₂) equals the initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus at rest (M*c² = 300 GeV). So, E₂ = 300 GeV - E₁.\n*   Substituting E₂ and the known rest-mass energies:\n    *   E₁² - (198 GeV)² = (300 GeV - E₁)² - (99 GeV)²\n    *   E₁² - 39204 GeV² = (90000 GeV² - 600 GeV * E₁ + E₁²) - 9801 GeV²\n    *   -39204 GeV² = 90000 GeV² - 600 GeV * E₁ - 9801 GeV²\n    *   600 GeV * E₁ = 90000 + 39204 - 9801 GeV²\n    *   600 GeV * E₁ = 119403 GeV²\n    *   E₁ = 119403 GeV² / 600 GeV = 199.005 GeV.\n*   The kinetic energy T₁ is the total energy E₁ minus the rest-mass energy m₁c².\n    *   **T1_correct =** 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = **1.005 GeV**.\n\n### 4. The Difference\n\nFinally, we calculate the difference between the correct and the classical values for T₁.\n\n*   **Difference =** T1_correct - T1_classical\n*   **Difference =** 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV\n\nThe question asks for the answer in Mega-electron Volts (MeV). Since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV:\n\n*   **Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
