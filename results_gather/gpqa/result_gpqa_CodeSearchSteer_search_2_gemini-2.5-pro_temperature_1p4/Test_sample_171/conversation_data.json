    "The correct relationship between the effective temperatures of the two stars can be determined by applying the Boltzmann equation, which describes the distribution of atoms among various energy levels in a system in thermal equilibrium.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **The Boltzmann Equation**: Under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the ratio of the number of atoms in an excited energy level (N₂) to the number of atoms in a lower energy level (N₁) is given by the Boltzmann equation:\n\n    (N₂ / N₁) = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T)]\n\n    Where:\n    *   `g₂` and `g₁` are the statistical weights of the energy levels.\n    *   `ΔE = E₂ - E₁` is the energy difference between the levels.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n    *   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n2.  **Setting up the Ratios for Both Stars**: Let's denote the ratio of the number of atoms in the specific excited level to a lower level as `R`. We can write this ratio for each star using their respective temperatures, T₁ and T₂.\n\n    *   For star 1:  R₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T₁)]\n    *   For star 2:  R₂ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T₂)]\n\n3.  **Using the Given Information**: The problem states that the excitation in star 1 is twice that in star 2. This means R₁ = 2 * R₂.\n\n    (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T₁)] = 2 * (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T₂)]\n\n4.  **Simplifying the Equation**: The term for the statistical weights (g₂ / g₁) is the same for both stars since it concerns the same atomic transition. Therefore, it cancels out.\n\n    exp[-ΔE / (k * T₁)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T₂)]\n\n    Taking the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides of the equation gives:\n\n    -ΔE / (k * T₁) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T₂)\n\n5.  **Solving for ln(2)**: Rearranging the terms to isolate ln(2):\n\n    ln(2) = ΔE / (k * T₂) - ΔE / (k * T₁)\n\n    Factoring out the common term (ΔE / k):\n\n    ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁)\n\n    Combining the fractions in the parenthesis:\n\n    ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ]\n\n6.  **Final Step**: The problem provides a key piece of information: the energy difference `ΔE` is approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J. This value is numerically equal to the Boltzmann constant, `k` (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K). Therefore, the ratio `ΔE / k` is equal to 1.\n\n    Substituting this into the equation:\n\n    ln(2) = 1 * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ]\n\n    This simplifies to:\n\n    ln(2) = [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ]\n\nComparing this result to the given options, it matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
