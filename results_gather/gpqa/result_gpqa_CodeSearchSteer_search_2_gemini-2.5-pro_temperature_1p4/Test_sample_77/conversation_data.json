    "The expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) for a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials are derived from Maxwell's equations and account for the fact that electromagnetic effects propagate at the finite speed of light, `c`.\n\nThe key is to evaluate the charge density and current at the \"retarded time\" `tr`. The retarded time is the instant in the past when the electromagnetic signal must have been emitted from the charge's position to reach the observer at position `$\\vec{r}$` at time `t`. It is defined by the relation: `t - tr = d/c`, where `d` is the magnitude of the vector `$\\vec{d}$`, which points from the charge's position at the retarded time, `$\\vec{s}(tr)$`, to the observation point `$\\vec{r}$`.\n\nThe correct Liénard-Wiechert potentials are given by:\n\nScalar Potential (V):\n`$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]_{t_r}$`\n\nVector Potential ($\\vec{A}$):\n`$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]_{t_r}$`\n\nThe subscript `$t_r$` indicates that all quantities inside the brackets—`d`, `$\\vec{d}$`, and `$\\vec{v}$`—are evaluated at the retarded time.\n\nTo match these standard forms with the given options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n\n`$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$`\n\n`$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$`\n\nThese expressions match option D. The term `$(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$` in the denominator accounts for the relativistic effects of the moving source, similar to a Doppler effect. The other options are incorrect because they either use the wrong sign in the denominator or use the static potential form, which does not account for retardation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
