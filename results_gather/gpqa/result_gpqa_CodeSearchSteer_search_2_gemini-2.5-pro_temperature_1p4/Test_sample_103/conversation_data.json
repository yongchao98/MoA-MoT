    "Here is a step-by-step solution to determine the ratio of the orbital periods of the two exoplanets.\n\n### 1. Understand the Radial Velocity (RV) Method\n\nThe radial velocity method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic shift in the spectral lines of their host star. This shift is caused by the Doppler effect as the star \"wobbles\" due to the gravitational pull of the orbiting planet. A larger wavelength shift implies a larger radial velocity of the star. The maximum observed shift corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as *K*.\n\n### 2. Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity Amplitude (K)\n\nThe observed wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (*v*<sub>r</sub>). Therefore, the maximum wavelength shift (Δλ<sub>max</sub>) is directly proportional to the radial velocity semi-amplitude (*K*).\n\nGiven:\n*   Maximum wavelength shift for planet #1, Δλ<sub>1</sub> = 5 miliangstrom.\n*   Maximum wavelength shift for planet #2, Δλ<sub>2</sub> = 7 miliangstrom.\n\nThe ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes is equal to the ratio of their maximum wavelength shifts:\n\n*K*<sub>2</sub> / *K*<sub>1</sub> = Δλ<sub>2</sub> / Δλ<sub>1</sub> = 7 / 5 = 1.4\n\n### 3. Connect Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (T)\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the radial velocity semi-amplitude *K* is related to the orbital period (*P* or *T*), the planet's mass (*M*<sub>p</sub>), the star's mass (*M*<sub>*</sub>), and the inclination of the orbit (*i*). The formula is:\n\n*K* = (2πG / *P*)<sup>1/3</sup> \\* (*M*<sub>p</sub> sin(*i*)) / (*M*<sub>*</sub> + *M*<sub>p</sub>)<sup>2/3</sup> \n\nFrom this equation, we can see the relationship between *K* and *P*:\n\n*K* ∝ *P*<sup>-1/3</sup>\n\nThis means the radial velocity amplitude is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods\n\nWe are given that:\n*   The stars have identical masses (*M*<sub>*1*</sub> = *M*<sub>*2*</sub>).\n*   The planets have similar masses (*M*<sub>p1</sub>* ≈ *M*<sub>p2</sub>*).\n*   The problem implies that other unstated factors, like the orbital inclination (*i*), can be assumed to be the same for both systems to allow for a direct comparison.\n\nGiven these similarities, we can establish a ratio:\n\n*K*<sub>2</sub> / *K*<sub>1</sub> = (*P*<sub>2</sub> / *P*<sub>1</sub>)<sup>-1/3</sup> = (*P*<sub>1</sub> / *P*<sub>2</sub>)<sup>1/3</sup>\n\nNow, substitute the value of the ratio *K*<sub>2</sub> / *K*<sub>1</sub> we found in step 2:\n\n1.4 = (*P*<sub>1</sub> / *P*<sub>2</sub>)<sup>1/3</sup>\n\nTo solve for the ratio of the periods, we cube both sides of the equation:\n\n1.4<sup>3</sup> = *P*<sub>1</sub> / *P*<sub>2</sub>\n2.744 = *P*<sub>1</sub> / *P*<sub>2</sub>\n\nThe question asks how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which is the ratio *P*<sub>2</sub> / *P*<sub>1</sub>. To find this, we take the reciprocal:\n\n*P*<sub>2</sub> / *P*<sub>1</sub> = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36.\n\n<<<D>>>"
