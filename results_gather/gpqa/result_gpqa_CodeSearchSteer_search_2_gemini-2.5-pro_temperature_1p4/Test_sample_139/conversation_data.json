    "Here is a step-by-slep solution to the chemistry puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The melting point of B is very close to 277 K (which is 3.85 °C or 38.93 °F). This is the well-known melting point of heavy water, Deuterium Oxide (D₂O). This immediately points to the involvement of Deuterium (D or ²H), a heavier isotope of hydrogen, which fits the first clue.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** The puzzle states that gas W has a molecule with an equal number of neutrons and protons. A prime candidate for this gas, given the presence of Deuterium, is Deuterium gas (D₂). A D₂ molecule consists of two Deuterium atoms. Each Deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X:** The clues point to X being a powerful reducing agent used in organic chemistry, and that it has a very close analog that is also a common reagent. This strongly suggests Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄) and its deuterated analog, Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄). LiAlH₄ is a strong reducing agent that reduces esters and carboxylic acids. Its deuterated analog, LiAlD₄, fits the description of Substance X.\n\n4.  **Verify the Reactions:**\n    *   **Reaction of X with Y to produce W and G:** The violent reaction is that of Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (X) with heavy water (Y). This reaction produces Deuterium gas (W) and a precipitate (G). The reaction is:\n        LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → 4D₂ (W) + LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G)\n    *   **Precipitate G releases B:** The precipitate G, aluminum deuteroxide Al(OD)₃, when heated, decomposes to release heavy water (B). The reaction is:\n        2Al(OD)₃ (G) → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O (B)\n    *   **Reaction with a keto acid:** The clue states that the reaction of X with a keto acid results in a product with two oxygen atoms. Keto acids have three oxygen atoms (one in the ketone group and two in the carboxylic acid group). A strong reducing agent like LiAlD₄ reduces both the ketone and the carboxylic acid functional groups. The reduction of the carboxylic acid group (–COOH) to an alcohol group (–CH₂OH) removes one oxygen atom, resulting in a product (a diol) with only two oxygen atoms. This is consistent with the power of LiAlH₄ (and by extension LiAlD₄) and inconsistent with milder reagents like NaBH₄.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses:**\n    *   **Substance X** is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride, with the formula **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen (atomic number Z=1). In the molecule, it is present as 4 atoms of Deuterium (²H). The mass number of Deuterium is 2. The cumulative mass is 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum (atomic number Z=13). In the molecule, it is present as 1 atom of its most stable isotope, Aluminum-27 (²⁷Al). The mass number is 27. The cumulative mass is 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   The cumulative atomic mass of the lightest and heaviest elements is the sum of these values: 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nTherefore, the cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<B>>>"
