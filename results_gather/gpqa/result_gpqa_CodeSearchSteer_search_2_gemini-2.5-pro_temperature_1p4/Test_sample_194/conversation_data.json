    "Here is the step-by-step derivation to determine the maximum orbital period for the second planet.\n\n**1. Define the Relationship Between Orbital Parameters**\n\nFor a transiting exoplanet, the impact parameter (*b*) is defined by the geometry of the orbit. It relates the semi-major axis (*a*), the orbital inclination (*i*), and the stellar radius (*R*<sub>s</sub>) with the following formula:\n\n*b* = (*a* \\* cos(*i*)) / *R*<sub>s</sub>\n\nSince both planets are in the same orbital plane, their orbital inclination *i* is the same. The stellar radius *R*<sub>s</sub> is also a constant for the system.\n\n**2. Use Planet 1's Data**\n\nWe can rearrange the formula for Planet 1's parameters:\n\ncos(*i*) = (*b*<sub>1</sub> \\* *R*<sub>s</sub>) / *a*<sub>1</sub>\n\nWe are given *b*<sub>1</sub> = 0.2.\n\n**3. Determine the Condition for Maximum Period of Planet 2**\n\nThe problem asks for the maximum orbital period (*P*<sub>2</sub>) for the second planet that still allows for transits. A longer period implies a larger semi-major axis (*a*<sub>2</sub>). The absolute limit for a transit to occur is when the center of the planet passes just over the edge of the star. This corresponds to a maximum impact parameter of *b*<sub>2</sub> = 1.\n\nUsing this limiting condition for Planet 2:\n\n1 = (*a*<sub>2,max</sub> \\* cos(*i*)) / *R*<sub>s</sub>\n\nTherefore, the maximum semi-major axis for Planet 2 is:\n\n*a*<sub>2,max</sub> = *R*<sub>s</sub> / cos(*i*)\n\n**4. Combine the Equations**\n\nNow, we substitute the expression for cos(*i*) from Planet 1's data into the equation for Planet 2:\n\n*a*<sub>2,max</sub> = *R*<sub>s</sub> / ((*b*<sub>1</sub> \\* *R*<sub>s</sub>) / *a*<sub>1</sub>)\n\nThe stellar radius *R*<sub>s</sub> cancels out, simplifying the relationship between the semi-major axes:\n\n*a*<sub>2,max</sub> = *a*<sub>1</sub> / *b*<sub>1</sub>\n\nPlugging in the value for *b*<sub>1</sub>:\n\n*a*<sub>2,max</sub> = *a*<sub>1</sub> / 0.2 = 5 \\* *a*<sub>1</sub>\n\nThis shows that the second planet can have a semi-major axis up to 5 times larger than the first planet and still exhibit a grazing transit. The information about the radii of the planets and the star is not needed for this calculation.\n\n**5. Apply Kepler's Third Law**\n\nKepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion states that the square of a planet's orbital period (*P*) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (*a*). For two planets orbiting the same star, we can write this as a ratio:\n\n(*P*<sub>2</sub> / *P*<sub>1</sub>)<sup>2</sup> = (*a*<sub>2</sub> / *a*<sub>1</sub>)<sup>3</sup>\n\n**6. Calculate the Maximum Period**\n\nWe can now solve for the maximum period of the second planet, *P*<sub>2,max</sub>, by substituting the ratio of the semi-major axes we found in step 4:\n\n(*P*<sub>2,max</sub> / *P*<sub>1</sub>)<sup>2</sup> = (*a*<sub>2,max</sub> / *a*<sub>1</sub>)<sup>3</sup> = (5)<sup>3</sup> = 125\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides:\n\n*P*<sub>2,max</sub> / *P*<sub>1</sub> = √125 ≈ 11.18\n\nFinally, calculate the value of *P*<sub>2,max</sub> using the given period of Planet 1 (*P*<sub>1</sub> = 3 days):\n\n*P*<sub>2,max</sub> = *P*<sub>1</sub> \\* √125 = 3 \\* 11.18 ≈ 33.54 days\n\nThis value is approximately 33.5 days.\n\nComparing our result to the given options:\nA) ~ 12.5\nB) ~ 7.5\nC) ~ 37.5\nD) ~ 33.5\n\nThe calculated maximum period matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
