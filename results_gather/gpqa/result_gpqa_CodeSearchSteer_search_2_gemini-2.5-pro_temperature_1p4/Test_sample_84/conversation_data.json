    "The web search results confirm the key physical principles and formulas used in the initial reasoning.\n\n*   **Equilibrium Temperature:** The equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on the star's properties (luminosity/temperature and radius) and the planet's semi-major axis and albedo. The formula derived in the thought process, `T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a)) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`, is standard. For a fixed star and the same albedo for both planets, the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2` simplifies to `sqrt(a2 / a1)`.\n*   **Doppler Shift and Radial Velocity:** The radial velocity (v_r) is directly proportional to the Doppler shift (Δλ) via the formula v_r = c * (Δλ / λ_0), where λ_0 is the rest wavelength. This confirms that the ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes (K) is equal to the ratio of the observed Doppler shifts: `K1 / K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2`.\n*   **Radial Velocity Semi-amplitude (K):** For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is related to the masses of the star (M_star) and planet (M_p), and the semi-major axis (a). The formula, assuming the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's (`M_p << M_star`) and the orbit is viewed edge-on (`sin(i)≈1`), is `K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)`. This is the same relationship used in the initial analysis.\n\nThe plan remains the same, as the physics and formulas have been verified.\n\n**1. Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a2 / a1):**\nFrom the radial velocity formula `K ≈ (M_p / sqrt(M_star)) * sqrt(G / a)`, we can solve for 'a':\n`a ≈ G * M_p^2 / (K^2 * M_star)`\nThe ratio of the semi-major axes is then:\n`a2 / a1 = (M_p2^2 / K2^2) / (M_p1^2 / K1^2) = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2`\n\n**2. Substitute the known values:**\n*   Mass ratio: `M_p2 / M_p1 = (5 M_earth) / (7 M_earth) = 5 / 7`\n*   Radial velocity ratio from Doppler shifts: `K1 / K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2 = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3 / 4`\n\nNow, calculate `a2 / a1`:\n`a2 / a1 = (5 / 7)^2 * (3 / 4)^2`\n`a2 / a1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)`\n`a2 / a1 = 225 / 784`\n\n**3. Calculate the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures (T_eq1 / T_eq2):**\nThe ratio is `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)`.\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28`\n\n**4. Final Calculation:**\n`15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.98\nB) ~ 1.05\nC) ~ 0.53\nD) ~ 1.30\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
