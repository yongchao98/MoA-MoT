    "The multi-step synthesis described involves a series of complex rearrangements and reactions. To determine the final product and its NMR spectrum, we must deduce the structure at each stage.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with a strong base (KOH) at a high temperature (240°C). This harsh condition promotes not just substitution or simple elimination, but a significant skeletal rearrangement of the adamantane cage. Such reactions are known to cleave one of the rings in the tricyclic adamantane system to form a bicyclic derivative. The spectroscopic data for product 1 (IR at 1720 cm⁻¹ for a ketone) and the subsequent ozonolysis reaction point towards the formation of an unsaturated ketone. A known product from such adamantane rearrangements is a derivative of bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane.\n\nThe most plausible structure for **Product 1** that accommodates all the reaction steps is **2-methylenebicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-7-one**. This bicyclic molecule contains a ten-carbon skeleton, a ketone group (=O), and an exocyclic double bond (=CH₂).\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\nProduct 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide, a reagent for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This selectively reduces the ketone to a secondary alcohol without affecting the double bond.\n*   **Product 2** is therefore **2-methylenebicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-7-ol**.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\nProduct 2 undergoes ozonolysis at -78°C followed by a reductive workup with dimethylsulfide (DMS). Ozonolysis cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) is cleaved to form a ketone (=O), while the original alcohol group remains unchanged.\n*   **Product 3** is **7-hydroxybicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-2-one**.\n\n**Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\nTo determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom, we first need to identify it. In the structure of 7-hydroxybicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-2-one, the most deshielded, non-exchangeable proton is the one on the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the C7-H proton). This type of proton typically has a chemical shift in the range of 3.5-4.5 ppm, significantly more deshielded than the protons alpha to the ketone (around 2.2-2.7 ppm).\n\nThe splitting pattern of this C7-H proton is determined by its neighboring protons. The bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane system exists in a preferred chair-chair conformation. In this conformation, the hydroxyl group at C7 will preferentially occupy the equatorial position to minimize steric strain, placing the C7-H proton in the axial position.\n\nAn axial proton like C7-H has four neighboring protons on the adjacent methylene groups, C6 and C8.\n*   Two of these neighbors are also in axial positions (C6-Hₐₓ and C8-Hₐₓ).\n*   Two neighbors are in equatorial positions (C6-Hₑq and C8-Hₑq).\n\nThe coupling constant (J-coupling) between axial protons (Jₐₓ₋ₐₓ) is typically large (around 8-12 Hz), while the coupling between an axial and an equatorial proton (Jₐₓ₋ₑq) is small (around 2-4 Hz).\n\nTherefore, the C7-H proton signal will be split by:\n1.  The two axial protons (C6-Hₐₓ and C8-Hₐₓ) with a large, similar coupling constant. This will split the signal into a **triplet**.\n2.  The two equatorial protons (C6-Hₑq and C8-Hₑq) with a small, similar coupling constant. This will further split each line of the initial triplet into another smaller **triplet**.\n\nThe resulting pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
