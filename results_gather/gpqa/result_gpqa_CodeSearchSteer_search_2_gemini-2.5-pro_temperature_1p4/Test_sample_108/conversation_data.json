    "To determine which partial wave is not permitted, we must check each proposed transition against the fundamental conservation laws of physics: conservation of angular momentum and conservation of parity, as well as the Pauli exclusion principle for the two-nucleon (NN) system.\n\n### **Initial State and Conservation Rules**\n\n1.  **Initial State (`1S0`)**: The two-nucleon system starts in a `1S0` state. From the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`, we can deduce the initial quantum numbers:\n    *   Orbital Angular Momentum: `L_i = 0` (since L is denoted by 'S')\n    *   Total Spin: `S_i = 0` (since `2S+1 = 1`)\n    *   Total Angular Momentum: `J_i = 0`\n\n2.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle**: For a two-nucleon system, the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. This leads to the rule that the sum `L + S + T` must be an odd number, where T is the isospin. For the initial `1S0` state, `L_i=0` and `S_i=0`, so `0 + 0 + T_i` must be odd, which means the initial isospin is `T_i = 1`. For the final NN state, the problem specifies that `T_f = 0`. Therefore, for the final state, `L_f + S_f + 0` must be odd, which simplifies to the condition that **`L_f + S_f` must be odd**.\n\n3.  **Conservation of Angular Momentum**: The total angular momentum of the initial state (`J_i = 0`) must equal the total angular momentum of the final state. The final state consists of the NN system (with total angular momentum `J_f`) and the particle X (with orbital angular momentum `l_X`). To conserve total angular momentum, the vector sum of `J_f` and `l_X` must be zero. This is only possible if their magnitudes are equal: **`J_f = l_X`**.\n\n4.  **Conservation of Parity**: The parity of the initial state must equal the parity of the final state.\n    *   The parity of a state is given by `P = (intrinsic parity) * (-1)^L`. The intrinsic parity of a two-nucleon system is `(+1) * (+1) = +1`.\n    *   Initial Parity: `P_i = (+1) * (-1)^L_i = (+1) * (-1)^0 = +1`.\n    *   Final Parity: `P_f = P(NN_f) * P(X) * (-1)^l_X`. We are given that the intrinsic parity of particle X is `P(X) = -1`. The intrinsic parity of the final NN system is `+1`. Therefore, `P_f = (+1) * (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`.\n    *   Setting `P_i = P_f` gives `+1 = (-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)`, which means the exponent `L_f + l_X + 1` must be even. This simplifies to the condition that **`L_f + l_X` must be odd**.\n\n### **Analysis of the Options**\n\nWe now test each proposed transition against the three derived conditions:\n1.  `L_f + S_f` is odd (Pauli principle)\n2.  `J_f = l_X` (Angular momentum conservation)\n3.  `L_f + l_X` is odd (Parity conservation)\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 0`, `J_f = 1`.\n*   Particle X (`p` wave): `l_X = 1`.\n*   **Check Conditions**:\n    1. `L_f + S_f = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd) -> **OK**\n    2. `J_f = 1`, `l_X = 1` -> **OK**\n    3. `L_f + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd) -> **OK**\n*   This transition is permitted.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 2`, `J_f = 3`.\n*   Particle X (`f` wave): `l_X = 3`.\n*   **Check Conditions**:\n    1. `L_f + S_f = 2 + 1 = 3` (odd) -> **OK**\n    2. `J_f = 3`, `l_X = 3` -> **OK**\n    3. `L_f + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd) -> **OK**\n*   This transition is permitted.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   This final state `7D1` implies `2S_f+1 = 7`, which means the spin of the final two-nucleon system is `S_f = 3`. This is physically impossible, as two spin-1/2 particles (nucleons) can only combine to a total spin of `S=0` or `S=1`. Therefore, this final state cannot be formed.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f = 1`, `L_f = 1`, `J_f = 0`.\n*   Particle X (`s` wave): `l_X = 0`.\n*   **Check Conditions**:\n    1. `L_f + S_f = 1 + 1 = 2` (even) -> **VIOLATED**\n    2. `J_f = 0`, `l_X = 0` -> **OK**\n    3. `L_f + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd) -> **OK**\n*   This transition is not permitted because it violates the Pauli exclusion principle for the final two-nucleon state. The state `3P0` with `T=0` is a forbidden state for two nucleons.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBoth C and D represent impermissible processes. However, option D violates a selection rule related to the transition dynamics (Pauli principle applied to the final state properties given in the prompt), while option C describes a final state that is fundamentally non-existent for a two-nucleon system. Within the context of evaluating transitions based on conservation rules and given conditions, the violation in D is a direct failure to satisfy the Pauli principle as specified (`L_f+S_f` must be odd for `T_f=0`).\n\n<<<D>>>"
