    "The less prominent phenotypic consequences of Klinefelter's syndrome (47,XXY) compared to Down's syndrome (Trisomy 21) are due to a dosage compensation mechanism known as X-chromosome inactivation. In individuals with more than one X chromosome, this process largely silences the genes on all but one X chromosome.\n\nIn Klinefelter's syndrome, one of the two X chromosomes is inactivated in each cell early in embryonic development. This inactivation is an epigenetic process involving chromatin modification. A long non-coding RNA called Xist coats the future inactive X chromosome, which then recruits proteins like histone methyltransferases. These enzymes modify the chromatin, for instance through methylation, packaging it into a dense, transcriptionally inactive structure called a Barr body. This process ensures that the dosage of most X-linked genes is similar to that of XY males, thus mitigating the effects of the extra chromosome.\n\nHowever, about 15-30% of genes on the \"inactivated\" X chromosome escape this silencing. The expression of these \"escapee\" genes from the extra X chromosome is thought to contribute to the characteristic features of Klinefelter's syndrome, such as tall stature and infertility.\n\nIn contrast, Down's syndrome is caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21, which is an autosome. There is no equivalent mechanism for inactivating an entire autosomal chromosome. Consequently, individuals with Down's syndrome have three active copies of most genes on chromosome 21, leading to a more significant gene dosage imbalance and the more severe and widespread phenotypic effects associated with the condition.\n\nTherefore, the correct molecular mechanism is the post-zygotic methylation of chromatin that leads to the inactivation of one X chromosome.\n\n<<<B>>>"
