    "This problem can be solved by applying the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and its effect on particle decay.\n\n### Breakdown of the Physics\n\n1.  **Particle Decay:** Unstable particles decay following an exponential law. The number of particles `N(t)` remaining after a time `t` from an initial number `N₀` is given by `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t/T)`, where `T` is the mean lifetime of the particle in the observer's reference frame.\n\n2.  **Time Dilation:** According to special relativity, the mean lifetime of a moving particle (`T`) as measured in the lab frame is longer than its lifetime in its own rest frame (`τ`, also known as proper lifetime). This relationship is defined by the Lorentz factor, `γ`: `T = γτ`.\n\n3.  **Survival Fraction:** The fraction of particles that reach the detector is the number of particles that have not decayed after traveling a distance `R` (the detector's radius). Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. The time of flight in the lab frame is `t = R/c`.\n\nCombining these principles, the fraction of particles reaching the detector wall (`N/N₀`) is:\n`N/N₀ = exp(-(R/c) / (γτ))`\n\n### Applying to the Given Scenarios\n\nLet's define a constant `k = (R/c) / τ`. This constant depends on the detector size and the proper lifetime of the particle, which are the same in both scenarios. The equation then becomes:\n`N/N₀ = exp(-k/γ)`\n\n**Scenario 1:**\n*   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`.\n*   Fraction of particles reaching the detector, `N₁/N₀ = 1/3`.\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation:\n`1/3 = exp(-k/20)`\n\nTo solve for `k`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(1/3) = -k/20`\n`-ln(3) = -k/20`\n`k = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n*   Fraction of particles reaching the detector, `N₂/N₀ = 2/3`.\n*   We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`.\n\nSubstituting these values and the expression for `k` into the equation:\n`2/3 = exp(-(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂)`\n\nAgain, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(2/3) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n`ln(2) - ln(3) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n`-(ln(3) - ln(2)) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n`ln(3/2) = (20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n\nNow, we solve for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)`\n`γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n\nUsing the approximate values for the natural logarithms (`ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(2) ≈ 0.6931`):\n`γ₂ ≈ (20 * 1.0986) / (1.0986 - 0.6931)`\n`γ₂ ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055`\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.197`\n\nThis calculated value is very close to 54.\n\n<<<B>>>"
