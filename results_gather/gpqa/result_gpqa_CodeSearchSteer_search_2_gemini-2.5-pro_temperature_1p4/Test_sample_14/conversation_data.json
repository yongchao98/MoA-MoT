    "The reasoning and calculations performed seem sound.\n\n1.  **Transit Probability**: The probability of a planet in a circular orbit transiting its star is indeed approximated by the ratio of the stellar radius to the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (P_transit ≈ R_s / a). This is because for a transit to occur, the orbital inclination `i` must be close to 90 degrees, and the range of angles that allows a transit is proportional to R_s / a.\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law**: Kepler's Third Law relates the orbital period (P), the semi-major axis (a), and the mass of the central body (M_s). The law states that P² is proportional to a³ / M_s. This can be rearranged to show that the semi-major axis `a` is proportional to (M_s * P²)^(1/3).\n\n3.  **Calculation Steps**: The steps to calculate the ratio of the transit probabilities were:\n    *   Ratio = P_transit_1 / P_transit_2 = (R_s1 / a1) / (R_s2 / a2)\n    *   Given R_s1 = R_s2, the ratio simplifies to a2 / a1.\n    *   Using the relationship from Kepler's Law: a ∝ (M_s * P²)^(1/3).\n    *   a1 ∝ (M_s1 * P1²)^(1/3) and a2 ∝ (M_s2 * P2²)^(1/3).\n    *   Ratio = [(M_s2 * P2²)^(1/3)] / [(M_s1 * P1²)^(1/3)]\n    *   Substitute M_s1 = 2 * M_s2 and P1 = P2 / 3.\n    *   Ratio = [(M_s2 * P2²)^(1/3)] / [((2 * M_s2) * (P2 / 3)²)^(1/3)]\n    *   Ratio = [(M_s2 * P2²)^(1/3)] / [(2/9 * M_s2 * P2²)^(1/3)]\n    *   The (M_s2 * P2²) terms cancel out.\n    *   Ratio = 1 / (2/9)^(1/3) = (9/2)^(1/3) = 4.5^(1/3)\n    *   (4.5)^(1/3) ≈ 1.65\n\nThe logic holds, and the calculation is correct. Planet_1, with its shorter period and more massive star, has a smaller semi-major axis. Since the stellar radii are the same, the smaller semi-major axis of Planet_1 leads to a higher geometric probability of transit. The factor is indeed ~1.65.\n\nTherefore, Planet_1 is the preferred target for observation.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit. - This matches the calculation.\nB) Planet_2 is preferred... - Incorrect.\nC) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability... - Incorrect factor.\nD) Planet_2 is preferred... - Incorrect.\n\nThe conclusion is robust.\n\n<<<A>>>"
