    "To find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻), we must first determine the hydrogen ion concentration ([H⁺]) of the buffer solution. The buffer is composed of dihydrogen phosphate (H₂PO₄⁻ from KH₂PO₄) and hydrogen phosphate (HPO₄²⁻ from Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O).\n\n**1. Calculate the moles of the buffer components:**\n*   **KH₂PO₄ (the acid component, H₂PO₄⁻):**\n    *   Mass = 1.00 g\n    *   Molar Mass = 136.09 g/mol\n    *   Moles = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 moles\n\n*   **Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O (the base component, HPO₄²⁻):**\n    *   Mass = 1.00 g\n    *   Molar Mass = 177.99 g/mol\n    *   Moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 moles\n\n**2. Calculate the initial concentrations:**\nThe volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³, which is equal to 0.200 L.\n*   [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 moles / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M\n*   [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 moles / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M\n\n**3. Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺]:**\nThe relevant equilibrium is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid, which involves the buffer pair H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻.\nH₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka₂ = 6.2x10⁻⁸.\n\nWe can use the Ka₂ expression to find [H⁺]:\nKa₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n[H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n[H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n[H⁺] ≈ 8.113 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n**4. Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO₄³⁻]:**\nThe orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is formed from the dissociation of the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO₄²⁻). This corresponds to the third dissociation of phosphoric acid.\nHPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹².\n\nWe use the Ka₃ expression to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\nKa₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n[PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * [HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺]\n\nNow, substitute the values we have calculated:\n[PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M) / (8.113 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n[PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.234 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThis value is closest to option C.\n\nFinal calculation check:\n*   Moles KH₂PO₄ = 1.00 / 136.09 = 0.00734808\n*   Moles Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O = 1.00 / 177.99 = 0.00561829\n*   Ratio of [H₂PO₄⁻]/[HPO₄²⁻] = 0.00734808 / 0.00561829 = 1.30789\n*   [H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * 1.30789 = 8.1089 x 10⁻⁸ M\n*   [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.00561829 / 0.200 = 0.028091 M\n*   [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.028091) / (8.1089 x 10⁻⁸) = 6.235 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
