    "Here is the step-by-step solution:\n\n1.  **Normalize the state vector**\n    Let the state be `|α> = C[(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`.\n    The normalization condition is `<α|α> = 1`.\n    The bra is `<α| = C*[(1-i)<up| + (2+i)<down|]`.\n    `<α|α> = |C|² * <(1-i)<up| + (2+i)<down|> * <(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`\n    `= |C|² * [(1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i)]`\n    `= |C|² * [1² - i² + 2² - i²]`\n    `= |C|² * [1 - (-1) + 4 - (-1)]`\n    `= |C|² * [2 + 5] = 7|C|²`\n    Since `<α|α> = 1`, we have `7|C|² = 1`, so `|C| = 1/√7`.\n    The normalized state is:\n    `|α> = (1/√7) * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`, which can be represented in matrix form as `|α> = (1/√7) * [[1+i], [2-i]]`.\n\n2.  **Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator A**\n    The matrix representation of A is given by `Aij = ħ/2` for `i ≠ j` and 0 otherwise. This gives the matrix:\n    `A = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\n    To find the eigenvalues (λ), we solve the characteristic equation `det(A - λI) = 0`:\n    `det([[ -λ, ħ/2 ], [ ħ/2, -λ ]]) = λ² - (ħ/2)² = 0`\n    The eigenvalues are `λ₁ = +ħ/2` and `λ₂ = -ħ/2`.\n\n    Now, find the corresponding eigenvectors:\n    For `λ₁ = +ħ/2`:\n    `(A - λ₁I)v₁ = 0`\n    `[[ -ħ/2, ħ/2 ], [ ħ/2, -ħ/2 ]] * [[a], [b]] = [[0], [0]]`\n    This gives `-a + b = 0`, so `a = b`. The normalized eigenvector is `|v₁> = (1/√2) * [[1], [1]] = (1/√2) * (|up> + |down>)`.\n\n    For `λ₂ = -ħ/2`:\n    `(A - λ₂I)v₂ = 0`\n    `[[ ħ/2, ħ/2 ], [ ħ/2, ħ/2 ]] * [[a], [b]] = [[0], [0]]`\n    This gives `a + b = 0`, so `a = -b`. The normalized eigenvector is `|v₂> = (1/√2) * [[1], [-1]] = (1/√2) * (|up> - |down>)`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the probabilities**\n    The probability of measuring an eigenvalue `λᵢ` is given by `P(λᵢ) = |<vᵢ|α>|²`.\n\n    Probability of measuring `λ₁ = +ħ/2`:\n    `<v₁|α> = [(1/√2) * (<up| + <down|)] * [(1/√7) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]`\n    `= (1/√14) * [(1+i) + (2-i)] = 3/√14`\n    `P(λ₁) = |3/√14|² = 9/14 ≈ 0.643`\n\n    Probability of measuring `λ₂ = -ħ/2`:\n    `<v₂|α> = [(1/√2) * (<up| - <down|)] * [(1/√7) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]`\n    `= (1/√14) * [(1+i) - (2-i)] = (1/√14) * [-1 + 2i]`\n    `P(λ₂) = |(-1 + 2i)/√14|² = ((-1)² + 2²)/14 = (1+4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.357`\n\n    The probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.\n\n4.  **Calculate the average (expectation) value of A**\n    The expectation value `<A>` can be calculated in two ways:\n    Method 1: Using probabilities and eigenvalues.\n    `<A> = P(λ₁)λ₁ + P(λ₂)λ₂`\n    `= (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2)`\n    `= (ħ/28) * (9 - 5) = 4ħ/28 = ħ/7`\n\n    Method 2: Using the matrix representation `<A> = <α|A|α>`.\n    `<A> = (1/√7) * [1-i, 2+i] * (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * (1/√7) * [[1+i], [2-i]]`\n    `= (ħ/14) * [1-i, 2+i] * [[2-i], [1+i]]`\n    `= (ħ/14) * [(1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i)]`\n    `= (ħ/14) * [(2 - 3i + i²) + (2 + 3i + i²)]`\n    `= (ħ/14) * [(1 - 3i) + (1 + 3i)]`\n    `= (ħ/14) * 2 = ħ/7`\n\n    The calculated probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value is `ħ/7`. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
