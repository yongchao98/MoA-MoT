    "To determine the time it will take for the 22-year-old astronaut to reach Earth from their perspective, we must account for the effects of time dilation due to the spacecraft's incredible speed. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n### 1. Distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud\nThe Large Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, is approximately 163,000 light-years away from Earth. This means that light, traveling at speed *c*, takes 163,000 years to cover this distance.\n\n### 2. Travel Time from Earth's Perspective\nFrom a stationary observer's point of view on Earth, the time it would take for the spacecraft to travel from the Large Magellanic Cloud is calculated by dividing the distance by the speed.\n\n*   **Distance (d):** 163,000 light-years\n*   **Speed (v):** 0.99999987 *c*\n\nTime (t) = Distance / Speed\nTime (t) = 163,000 light-years / (0.99999987 * *c*)\nTime (t) ≈ 163,002.12 years\n\nSo, from Earth's frame of reference, the journey would take approximately 163,002 years.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Time from the Astronaut's Perspective\nDue to the theory of special relativity, time for the astronaut moving at a relativistic speed will pass slower than for a stationary observer. This phenomenon is known as time dilation. The formula for time dilation is:\n\nt' = t / γ\n\nWhere:\n*   **t'** is the time experienced by the astronaut (proper time).\n*   **t** is the time measured by the observer on Earth.\n*   **γ (gamma)** is the Lorentz factor.\n\nThe Lorentz factor is calculated using the formula:\n\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nFirst, we calculate v²/c²:\n(0.99999987*c)² / c² = 0.99999987² ≈ 0.99999974\n\nThen, we calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):\nγ = 1 / √(1 - 0.99999974)\nγ = 1 / √(0.00000026)\nγ = 1 / 0.0005099\nγ ≈ 1961.16\n\nNow, we can calculate the time experienced by the astronaut (t'):\nt' = 163,002.12 years / 1961.16\nt' ≈ 83.12 years\n\n### 4. The Astronaut's Age Upon Arrival\nThe journey will take approximately 83.12 years from the astronaut's perspective. To find the astronaut's age upon reaching Earth, we add this travel time to their initial age.\n\n*   **Initial Age:** 22 years\n*   **Travel Time (astronaut's perspective):** ~83 years\n\nAge upon arrival = 22 + 83.12 = 105.12 years.\n\nSince the average lifetime of this alien species is 150 solar years, the astronaut, who will be approximately 105 years old upon arrival, will have survived the journey.\n\nComparing our calculated travel time for the astronaut (~83 years) to the given options, the closest answer is 81 years. The slight difference can be attributed to rounding in the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud and the speed of the spacecraft. Given the choices, 81 years is the most plausible answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
