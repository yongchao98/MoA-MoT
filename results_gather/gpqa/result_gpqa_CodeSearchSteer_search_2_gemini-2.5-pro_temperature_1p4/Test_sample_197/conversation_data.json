    "To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], we must calculate the fraction of this species relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n### 1. Identify the Species and Equilibria\n\nThe relevant cobalt-containing species in the solution are the free Co(II) ion and its complexes with thiocyanate (SCN⁻):\n*   Co²⁺ (free ion)\n*   [Co(SCN)]⁺\n*   [Co(SCN)₂]\n*   [Co(SCN)₃]⁻\n*   [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻\n\nThe formation of these complexes is governed by their overall stability constants (β):\n*   **β₁ = 9** for Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺\n*   **β₂ = 40** for Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂]\n*   **β₃ = 63** for Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻\n*   **β₄ = 16** for Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻\n\n### 2. Formulate the Fraction of the Desired Species\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of all cobalt species. The fraction of any single species, αₙ, can be expressed in terms of the free ligand concentration ([SCN⁻]) and the stability constants.\n\nThe fraction of the dithiocyanato complex (α₂) is given by the formula:\nα₂ = [Co(SCN)₂] / c(Co)\n\nThis can be expanded as:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nThis type of calculation is standard for determining the distribution of species in a complex-ion equilibrium.\n\n### 3. Perform the Calculation\n\nWe are given the following values:\n*   Total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10⁻² M (0.01 M)\n*   Total thiocyanate concentration, c(SCN⁻) = 0.1 M\n\nSince the thiocyanate concentration is ten times greater than the cobalt concentration, we can use the common and reasonable approximation that the free thiocyanate concentration at equilibrium is equal to its initial total concentration:\n[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M\n\nNow, we calculate each term in the formula for α₂:\n*   **Numerator**:\n    *   β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = 0.4\n*   **Denominator**:\n    *   1 (representing free Co²⁺)\n    *   β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 × 0.1 = 0.9\n    *   β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 0.4\n    *   β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = 63 × 0.001 = 0.063\n    *   β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = 16 × 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nThe sum of the terms in the denominator is:\n1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nFinally, we calculate the fraction α₂:\nα₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n### 4. Convert to Percentage\n\nTo find the percentage, we multiply the fraction by 100:\nPercentage of [Co(SCN)₂] = 0.16916 × 100% ≈ 16.9%\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
