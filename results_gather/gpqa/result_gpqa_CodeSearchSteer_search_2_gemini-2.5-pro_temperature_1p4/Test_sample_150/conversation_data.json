    "To calculate the probability that the measurement of the observable `P` will yield the value 0, we must follow the principles of quantum mechanics. The possible outcomes of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the observable's operator. The probability of measuring a specific eigenvalue is found using the Born rule, which involves projecting the system's state vector onto the corresponding eigenvector.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation:\n\n**1. Identify the Given Information**\n*   The state of the system at time `t` is `|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]ᵀ`.\n*   The observable operator is `P`:\n    ```\n    P = | 0     1/√2   0     |\n        | 1/√2  0      1/√2  |\n        | 0     1/√2   0     |\n    ```\n\n**2. Find the Eigenvalues of the Operator P**\nThe possible results of the measurement are the eigenvalues (λ) of `P`. We find them by solving the characteristic equation `det(P - λI) = 0`.\n```\ndet | -λ    1/√2   0     | = 0\n    | 1/√2  -λ     1/√2  |\n    | 0     1/√2   -λ    |\n```\nThis expands to:\n-λ(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)(-λ/√2) = 0\n-λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 = 0\n-λ³ + λ = 0\nλ(1 - λ²) = 0\n\nThe eigenvalues are λ = 0, λ = 1, and λ = -1. Since 0 is an eigenvalue, it is a possible outcome of the measurement.\n\n**3. Find the Eigenvector for the Eigenvalue λ = 0**\nNext, we find the eigenvector `|v₀⟩` corresponding to the eigenvalue λ = 0 by solving the equation `P|v₀⟩ = 0|v₀⟩`. Let `|v₀⟩ = [x, y, z]ᵀ`.\n```\n| 0     1/√2   0     | | x |   | 0 |\n| 1/√2  0      1/√2  | | y | = | 0 |\n| 0     1/√2   0     | | z |   | 0 |\n```\nThis gives the system of equations:\n*   (1/√2)y = 0  ⇒  y = 0\n*   (1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0  ⇒  x + z = 0  ⇒  x = -z\n\nThe eigenvector is of the form `[x, 0, -x]ᵀ`. We can choose x = 1 for simplicity, so a corresponding (non-normalized) eigenvector is `|v₀⟩ = [1, 0, -1]ᵀ`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Probability**\nThe probability of measuring an eigenvalue `λ` is given by the formula `Prob(λ) = |⟨vλ|ψ⟩|² / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩`. This formula uses the inner product of the eigenvector `vλ` and the state vector `ψ`, and it correctly accounts for unnormalized state vectors.\n\n*   First, we calculate the inner product `⟨ψ|ψ⟩`:\n    `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`\n\n*   Next, we calculate the inner product `⟨v₀|ψ⟩`:\n    `⟨v₀|ψ⟩ = [1, 0, -1] * [-1, 2, 1]ᵀ = (1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1) = -1 - 1 = -2`\n\n*   Then, we find the squared magnitude of this result:\n    `|⟨v₀|ψ⟩|² = (-2)² = 4`\n\n*   Finally, we compute the probability:\n    `Prob(0) = |⟨v₀|ψ⟩|² / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = 4 / 6 = 2/3`\n\nWait, let me recheck the calculation.\n\n**Correction on Step 4**\n\nLet's re-calculate the inner products carefully.\n\n*   `⟨v₀| = [1, 0, -1]`\n*   `|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]ᵀ`\n*   `⟨v₀|ψ⟩ = (1)*(-1) + (0)*(2) + (-1)*(1) = -1 + 0 - 1 = -2`\n*   `|⟨v₀|ψ⟩|² = (-2)² = 4`\n*   `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + (2)² + (1)² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`\n*   `Prob(0) = 4 / 6 = 2/3`\n\nLet me try using the *normalized* eigenvector `|v₀_norm⟩ = [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]ᵀ`.\n*   `⟨v₀_norm|ψ⟩ = (1/√2)*(-1) + (0)*(2) + (-1/√2)*(1) = -1/√2 - 1/√2 = -2/√2 = -√2`\n*   `|⟨v₀_norm|ψ⟩|² = (-√2)² = 2`\n*   `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = 6`\n*   `Prob(0) = |⟨v₀_norm|ψ⟩|² / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = 2 / 6 = 1/3`\n\nThere is a calculation error in the first attempt. Let's trace it.\nThe error lies in how the inner product is used. The formula `Prob(λ) = |⟨vλ|ψ⟩|² / (⟨vλ|vλ⟩ * ⟨ψ|ψ⟩)` is the most general form for unnormalized vectors.\n\nLet's use the unnormalized eigenvector `|v₀⟩ = [1, 0, -1]ᵀ`.\n*   `⟨v₀|v₀⟩ = 1² + 0² + (-1)² = 2`\n*   `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = 6`\n*   `⟨v₀|ψ⟩ = -2`, so `|⟨v₀|ψ⟩|² = 4`\n\nNow, plug these into the general formula:\n`Prob(0) = 4 / (2 * 6) = 4 / 12 = 1/3`.\n\nBoth methods now correctly yield 1/3. The probability that the measurement will yield 0 is 1/3.\n\nFinal Answer Check:\n*   Eigenvalues (0, 1, -1) are correct.\n*   Eigenvector for λ=0, `x[1, 0, -1]`, is correct.\n*   The probability calculation `Prob(0) = |<v₀|ψ>|² / (<v₀|v₀><ψ|ψ>)` is the reliable method for unnormalized vectors.\n*   `<v₀|ψ> = -2`\n*   `<v₀|v₀> = 2`\n*   `<ψ|ψ> = 6`\n*   `Prob(0) = (-2)² / (2 * 6) = 4 / 12 = 1/3`.\nThe calculation is confirmed.\n\n<<<C>>>"
