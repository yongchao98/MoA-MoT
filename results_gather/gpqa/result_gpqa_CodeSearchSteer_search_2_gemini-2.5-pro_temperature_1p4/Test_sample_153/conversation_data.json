    "Based on the thorough analysis of the provided spectral data, the unidentified compound is identified as 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry (MS):** The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 and the M+2 peak at m/z = 158 with a relative intensity of about 32% (approximately a 3:1 ratio) strongly indicates the presence of a single chlorine atom. The molecular weight of all the proposed structures is indeed around 156 g/mol.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:** The spectrum displays a very broad absorption between 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ and a sharp, strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. This combination is highly characteristic of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH), where the broad peak corresponds to the O-H stretch and the sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch. This eliminates phenyl chloroformate and 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde as possibilities.\n\n*   **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The singlet at 11.0 ppm is definitive for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The aromatic region shows two doublets: one at 8.02 ppm for 2 protons and another at 7.72 ppm for 2 protons. This symmetrical pattern is a classic indicator of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons adjacent (ortho) to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group are more deshielded and thus appear further downfield (8.02 ppm) than the protons adjacent (ortho) to the chlorine atom (7.72 ppm).\n    *   This NMR pattern rules out 2-chlorobenzoic acid, which would show a more complex splitting pattern for its four aromatic protons.\n\nThe combined data from MS, IR, and ¹H NMR all consistently and conclusively point to the structure of 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>"
