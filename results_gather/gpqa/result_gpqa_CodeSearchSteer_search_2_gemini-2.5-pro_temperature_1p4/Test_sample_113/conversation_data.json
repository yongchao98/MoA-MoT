    "Here is the step-by-step analysis of the reactions to determine the appropriate reagents.\n\n### Reaction 1:\n**butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\nThis reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin from a ketone (butan-2-one).\n\n1.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** Sodium cyanide (NaCN) provides the cyanide ion (CN⁻), which is a strong nucleophile. It attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n2.  **Intermediate Formation:** This attack forms a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate.\n3.  **Protonation:** The negatively charged oxygen atom in the intermediate needs to be protonated to form the final hydroxyl (-OH) group of the cyanohydrin product. Reagent **A** must be a source of protons (H⁺). An acidic workup, represented by H₃O⁺, is commonly used for this step.\n\nTherefore, **A = H₃O⁺**.\n\n### Reaction 2:\n**2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\nThis reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** The conversion of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid is a hydrolysis reaction.\n2.  **Conditions:** This hydrolysis is typically carried out by heating the nitrile with either a strong acid or a strong base.\n3.  **Reagent B:** To convert the nitrile directly to the carboxylic acid, it can be heated under reflux with a strong acid like dilute hydrochloric acid (HCl) or sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). Using a weak acid like acetic acid (CH₃COOH) would be significantly less effective.\n\nTherefore, **B = HCl** is the suitable strong acid for this transformation.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Reagent **A** is **H₃O⁺**.\n*   Reagent **B** is **HCl**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
