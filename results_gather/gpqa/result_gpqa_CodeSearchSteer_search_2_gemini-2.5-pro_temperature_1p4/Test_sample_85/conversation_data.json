    "To determine the proper starting materials, we must analyze the two reactions, focusing on the selectivity of the reducing agents and the stereochemistry of the starting materials and products.\n\n### **Analysis of the Reactions**\n\nThe product in both reactions is a stereoisomer of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered lactone (a cyclic ester). Lactones are formed from the intramolecular cyclization of a hydroxy-carboxylic acid. In this case, the precursor is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n\n**Stereochemistry:**\nThe chiral center in the starting material, 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, is at the C-3 position. The chiral center in the product, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, is at the C-4 position. The reduction and subsequent lactonization (ring formation) do not affect the stereocenter. Therefore, the stereochemical configuration (R or S) of the starting material will be retained in the final product.\n\n*   **Reaction A** produces **(R)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This means the starting material **A** must have the **(R)** configuration.\n*   **Reaction B** produces **(S)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This means the starting material **B** must have the **(S)** configuration.\n\nBased on stereochemistry alone, option (C) is the only possibility. Now, let's confirm this by examining the chemoselectivity of the reducing agents.\n\n### **Selectivity of the Reducing Agents**\n\nThe starting material, 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, is an acid-ester, meaning it has both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an ester group (-COOiBu).\n\n*   **Structure:** HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu\n\n**Reaction A: Reduction with LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride)**\n*   Lithium borohydride is a reducing agent known to selectively reduce esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   LiBH₄ will reduce the isobutyl ester group at C-5 to a primary alcohol.\n*   (R)-HOOC-...-COOiBu + LiBH₄ → (R)-HOOC-...-CH₂OH\n*   This creates (R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid, which cyclizes under acidic workup (H+) to form the (R)-lactone. This matches the outcome of Reaction A.\n\n**Reaction B: Reduction with BH₃ (Borane)**\n*   Borane is known to selectively reduce carboxylic acids much faster than it reduces esters.\n*   BH₃ will reduce the carboxylic acid group at C-1 to a primary alcohol.\n*   (S)-HOOC-...-COOiBu + BH₃ → (S)-HO-CH₂-...-COOiBu\n*   This creates the intermediate isobutyl (S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate. Under acidic workup (H+), this hydroxy-ester cyclizes (via hydrolysis followed by lactonization or via transesterification) to form the (S)-lactone. This matches the outcome of Reaction B.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe opposite chemoselectivity of the two reducing agents on the two different enantiomers of the starting material leads to the respective stereoisomers of the product. The stereochemistry is retained throughout each reaction sequence.\n\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
