    "### Analysis of the Transition\n\n1.  **Initial State**: The hydrogen atom starts in the $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ state, which is also known as the 3s state.\n\n2.  **Final State**: The final state is $|1,0,0\\rangle$, the ground state (1s).\n\n3.  **Process**: The decay occurs via two sequential electric dipole transitions.\n\n4.  **Electric Dipole Selection Rules**: For an electric dipole transition to be allowed, the quantum numbers must change according to the following rules:\n    *   The orbital angular momentum quantum number, $l$, must change by $\\pm 1$ ($\\Delta l = \\pm 1$).\n    *   The magnetic quantum number, $m$, can change by $0$ or $\\pm 1$ ($\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$).\n    *   The principal quantum number, $n$, must change. For a decay process, it must decrease.\n    *   A direct transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden because $\\Delta l = 0$, violating the selection rule. Therefore, a two-step (or more) process is necessary.\n\n### Step 1: First Transition $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$\n\n*   **Initial State**: $|3,0,0\\rangle$ ($n=3, l=0, m=0$).\n*   **Applying Selection Rules**:\n    *   $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$: Since the initial $l=0$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n    *   $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$: Since the initial $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m'=0, +1,$ or $-1$.\n    *   $n$ must decrease, so $n'$ can be 2 or 1. Since the final goal is $n=1$ after a *second* transition, the intermediate state must have $n'=2$.\n*   **Possible Intermediate States**: Based on the rules, the allowed intermediate states are $|2,1,1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$. These correspond to the three degenerate sub-levels of the 2p orbital.\n\n### Step 2: Second Transition $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n*   **Final State**: $|1,0,0\\rangle$ ($n=1, l=0, m=0$).\n*   Let's check if the possible intermediate states can transition to the final state:\n    *   From $|2,1,1\\rangle$: $\\Delta l = 0-1 = -1$ (allowed) and $\\Delta m = 0-1 = -1$ (allowed).\n    *   From $|2,1,0\\rangle$: $\\Delta l = 0-1 = -1$ (allowed) and $\\Delta m = 0-0 = 0$ (allowed).\n    *   From $|2,1,-1\\rangle$: $\\Delta l = 0-1 = -1$ (allowed) and $\\Delta m = 0-(-1) = +1$ (allowed).\n*   **Conclusion**: All three pathways, via any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, are permitted by the selection rules.\n\n### Determining the Probability (Branching Ratio)\n\nThe question asks for the transition route *and* the corresponding probability. This refers to the probability of the atom taking one specific path out of the several available. The decay starts from the spherically symmetric $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state. In the absence of external fields that could distinguish a direction in space, the transitions to the three degenerate states ($|2,1,1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$) are equally probable.\n\n*   The atom in the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state must decay into one of the three possible $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states.\n*   The total probability of this first step is 1.\n*   Since there are three equally likely, degenerate final states for this first step, the probability of transitioning into any single one of them is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   Once the atom is in a specific intermediate state (e.g., $|2,1,0\\rangle$), it will decay to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state with a certain rate, but the branching fraction for that specific *first* step is what determines the probability of the overall path.\n\nTherefore, for any of the specific routes:\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ (Correct path and probability)\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\n*   D) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ (Incorrect probability and typo in the state)\n\nThe correct option is B, as it identifies a valid route and the correct branching ratio for that step.\n\n<<<B>>>"
