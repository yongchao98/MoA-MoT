    "To determine the concentration of free calcium ions (Ca²⁺) in a solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, we must consider the dissociation equilibrium of the complex.\n\n**1. Reaction and Formation Constant**\nThe formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is represented by the following equilibrium:\nCa²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca-EDTA]²⁻\n\nThe formation constant (Kf), also known as the stability constant, for this reaction is given as:\nKf = [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) = 5.0 x 10¹⁰\n\n**2. Dissociation Equilibrium**\nThe problem starts with a 0.02 M solution of the [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ complex. This complex will dissociate to a small extent back into its constituent ions:\n[Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\n**3. Equilibrium Calculation**\nWe can set up an ICE table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) to find the concentration of the dissociated ions. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions at equilibrium.\n\n| Species         | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n|-----------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n| [Ca-EDTA]²⁻     | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| Ca²⁺            | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| EDTA⁴⁻          | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\nNow, we substitute these equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\nKf = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n5.0 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / x²\n\n**4. Simplification and Solving for x**\nBecause the formation constant (Kf) is very large, the dissociation of the complex is minimal. This means that 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). Therefore, we can make the simplifying assumption that:\n0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\nThe equation now becomes:\n5.0 x 10¹⁰ = 0.02 / x²\n\nNow, we solve for x:\nx² = 0.02 / (5.0 x 10¹⁰)\nx² = (2 x 10⁻²) / (5 x 10¹⁰)\nx² = 0.4 x 10⁻¹²\nx² = 4 x 10⁻¹³\n\nx = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\nx = 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is equal to x.\n\nTherefore, the concentration of Ca²⁺ is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M. This value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
