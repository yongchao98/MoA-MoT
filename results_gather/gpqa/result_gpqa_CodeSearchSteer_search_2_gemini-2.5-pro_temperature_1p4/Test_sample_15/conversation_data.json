    "An optically active compound is one that is chiral and not a meso compound. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image, which is most often due to the presence of one or more stereocenters and a lack of internal symmetry. Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  ***(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene***: This molecule contains a carbon-carbon double bond. Neither of the carbons in the double bond is a chiral center. The molecule has a plane of symmetry containing the atoms of the double bond, making it achiral and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  ***(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione***: The name itself indicates a specific stereoisomer with absolute configurations (3aR, 7aS) assigned to its chiral centers. The designation of a single enantiomer confirms that the molecule is chiral and thus **optically active**.\n\n3.  ***(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid***: This molecule has two chiral centers at carbons 2 and 3. However, the substituents on both chiral carbons are identical (a hydrogen atom, a methyl group, a carboxylic acid group, and the other chiral carbon). The (2R,3S) configuration results in a meso compound, which has an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Meso compounds are achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  ***(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid***: Like its diastereomer above, this molecule has two chiral centers. The (2R,3R) configuration is not meso and does not have an internal plane of symmetry. Its mirror image is the (2S,3S) enantiomer, and they are non-superimposable. Therefore, this compound is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n5.  ***(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol***: The name specifies the (R) configuration at carbon 1, which is a chiral center. Carbon 1 is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group, a hydrogen atom, and two different carbon pathways within the ring due to the double bond's location. The specification of a single enantiomer means the compound is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n6.  ***(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol***: The notation indicates that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all-cis). This molecule, despite having three stereocenters, possesses a high degree of symmetry. It has a threefold axis of rotation (C3) and three vertical planes of symmetry (σv), which makes it achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  ***1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one***: To determine if this compound is chiral, we must check for stereocenters. The structure is (CH₃)₂CHCH₂C(=O)-cyclopentyl. The only carbon atom that could potentially be a chiral center is carbon 3 of the butane chain, which is bonded to a hydrogen and two methyl groups. Since two of the groups attached to this carbon are identical (methyl groups), it is not a chiral center. The molecule has a plane of symmetry and is achiral, making it **optically inactive**.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<C>>>"
