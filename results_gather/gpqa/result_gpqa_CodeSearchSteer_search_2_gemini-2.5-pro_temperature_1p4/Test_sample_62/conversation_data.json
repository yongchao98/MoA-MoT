    "### Analysis and Calculation\n\nTo determine the momentum of the absorbed photon, we must first identify the initial and final energy states of the molecule and calculate the energy difference between them.\n\n1.  **Initial State (Fundamental State):** The molecule is in its fundamental or ground state. This corresponds to the lowest possible vibrational and rotational quantum numbers:\n    *   Vibrational quantum number, v = 0\n    *   Rotational quantum number, J = 0\n\n2.  **Final State (Next Lowest Energy State):** A photon absorption must follow specific selection rules. For rovibrational transitions in a diatomic molecule, the rules are Δv = +1 and ΔJ = ±1. The ground state is (v=0, J=0).\n    *   A purely rotational transition (Δv=0, ΔJ=+1) to the (v=0, J=1) state is possible but has very low energy and does not match the provided options. The inclusion of the vibrational frequency (ω) in the problem data strongly implies a vibrational transition is occurring.\n    *   The lowest energy transition that involves a change in the vibrational state starts from (v=0, J=0). According to the selection rules, J must change by +1 or -1. Since J cannot be negative, the only possible transition is to a state with J=1.\n    *   Therefore, the final state is (v=1, J=1). This corresponds to the first line in the R-branch of the rovibrational spectrum.\n\n3.  **Energy Calculation:** The energy of a state in the rotation-vibration model is given by:\n    *   E(v, J) = ħω(v + 1/2) + [ħ² / (2I)] * J(J + 1)\n    *   Where ħ is the reduced Planck constant, ω is the vibrational angular frequency, I is the moment of inertia, v is the vibrational quantum number, and J is the rotational quantum number.\n\n4.  **Energy of the Transition (ΔE):** The energy of the absorbed photon is the difference between the final and initial state energies.\n    *   E_initial = E(0, 0) = ħω(0 + 1/2) + [ħ² / (2I)] * 0(0 + 1) = (1/2)ħω\n    *   E_final = E(1, 1) = ħω(1 + 1/2) + [ħ² / (2I)] * 1(1 + 1) = (3/2)ħω + ħ²/I\n    *   ΔE = E_final - E_initial = [(3/2)ħω + ħ²/I] - [(1/2)ħω] = ħω + ħ²/I\n\n5.  **Numerical Calculation:**\n\n    *   **Constants:**\n        *   Reduced Planck constant (ħ) ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n        *   Speed of light (c) ≈ 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s\n        *   Atomic mass unit (amu) ≈ 1.66 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n\n    *   **Given Values:**\n        *   Mx = 20 amu\n        *   My = 2 amu\n        *   R = 2 Å = 2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n        *   ω = 4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s\n\n    *   **Step 1: Calculate Reduced Mass (μ)**\n        *   μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu\n        *   μ ≈ 1.818 * (1.66 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) ≈ 3.018 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n\n    *   **Step 2: Calculate Moment of Inertia (I)**\n        *   I = μR² = (3.018 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)²\n        *   I ≈ 1.207 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n\n    *   **Step 3: Calculate Transition Energy (ΔE)**\n        *   Vibrational part (ħω) = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s) ≈ 4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n        *   Rotational part (ħ²/I) = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (1.207 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²) ≈ 9.22 x 10⁻²³ J\n        *   ΔE = (4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J) + (0.00922 x 10⁻²⁰ J) ≈ 4.225 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n\n    *   **Step 4: Calculate Photon Momentum (p)**\n        *   The energy of a photon is related to its momentum by E = pc.\n        *   p = ΔE / c\n        *   p ≈ (4.225 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (3.00 x 10⁸ m/s)\n        *   p ≈ 1.408 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n\nThis calculated momentum is approximately 1.4 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
