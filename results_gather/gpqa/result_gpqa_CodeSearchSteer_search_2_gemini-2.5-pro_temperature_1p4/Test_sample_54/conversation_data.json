    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Total Number of Protons\n\n*   The integrations of the signals are 1H, 1H, 3H, and 3H.\n*   The total number of hydrogen atoms (protons) in the molecule is 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 8.\n*   **Propenyl acetate (C₅H₈O₂):** The molecular formula contains 8 hydrogen atoms, which matches the NMR data.\n*   **Butenyl acetate (C₆H₁₀O₂):** The molecular formula contains 10 hydrogen atoms. This does not match the NMR data.\n\nThis initial analysis eliminates both Cis- and Trans-butenyl acetate. The unknown compound must be either Cis- or Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n### 2. Analysis of Each Signal\n\nThe remaining candidates are Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate. Let's analyze the individual signals from the 1H NMR spectrum:\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** A singlet (`s`) indicates these 3 protons have no adjacent proton neighbors. A chemical shift of ~2.1 ppm is characteristic of the methyl group in an acetate (CH₃-C=O). This fits the structure of propenyl acetate.\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** A doublet (`d`) indicates these 3 protons are coupled to one neighboring proton. This signal corresponds to the methyl group attached to the double bond (CH₃-CH=). It is split into a doublet by the adjacent vinyl proton.\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** A doublet of quartets (`dq`) indicates this proton is coupled to one adjacent proton (giving the doublet) and a group of three adjacent protons (giving the quartet). This corresponds to the vinyl proton next to the methyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃). It is split by the other vinyl proton and the three protons of the methyl group.\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** A doublet (`d`) indicates this proton is coupled to one other proton. This corresponds to the vinyl proton next to the oxygen atom (-O-CH=CH-). The downfield chemical shift (7.0 ppm) is due to the deshielding effect of the adjacent oxygen atom.\n\n### 3. Determination of Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans)\n\nThe key to distinguishing between the cis and trans isomers is the coupling constant (J) between the two vinyl protons.\n\n*   The signal at 7.0 ppm is a doublet with a coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n*   The coupling constant for vinyl protons in a **trans** configuration is typically large, in the range of 11-18 Hz.\n*   The coupling constant for vinyl protons in a **cis** configuration is smaller, usually in the range of 6-12 Hz.\n\nSince the observed coupling constant is 16.0 Hz, this falls squarely in the range for trans-alkenes. This indicates that the two protons on the double bond are in a trans orientation.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the number of protons, the chemical shifts, the splitting patterns, and particularly the large coupling constant of the vinyl protons, the unknown compound is identified as **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
