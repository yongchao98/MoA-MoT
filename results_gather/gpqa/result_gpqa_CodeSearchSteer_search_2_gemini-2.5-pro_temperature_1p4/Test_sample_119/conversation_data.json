    "To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with the parallax itself, under the assumption of a uniform distribution of stars in space, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Volume of a spherical shell**: If we consider stars at a distance *d* from Earth, they can be thought of as lying within a thin spherical shell of radius *d* and thickness *dd*. The volume of this shell (*dV*) is approximately the surface area of the sphere times its thickness:\n    *dV* = 4π*d*² *dd*\n\n2.  **Number of stars in the shell**: With a uniform stellar density (ρ, number of stars per unit volume), the number of stars (*dN*) in this shell is the density multiplied by the volume:\n    *dN* = ρ * 4π*d*² *dd*\n\n3.  **Relating distance to parallax**: The parallax (plx or *p*) is inversely proportional to the distance *d*. For simplicity in calculations, we can write this relationship as:\n    *d* = 1/*p*\n\n4.  **Expressing the change in distance in terms of parallax**: To substitute *dd* in our equation, we need to find its relationship with the change in parallax, *dp*. We can do this by taking the derivative of the distance equation with respect to parallax:\n    *dd*/*dp* = d/d*p* (1/*p*) = -1/*p*²\n    The negative sign simply indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases. We are interested in the magnitude of the relationship, so |*dd*| = (1/*p*²) |*dp*|.\n\n5.  **Substituting into the number of stars equation**: Now we replace *d* and *dd* in the equation for *dN* with their parallax equivalents:\n    *dN* = ρ * 4π * (1/*p*)² * (1/*p*² *d*p*)\n    *dN* = ρ * 4π * (1/*p*⁴) *d*p*\n\n6.  **Finding the number of stars per unit parallax**: The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is *dN*/*dp*. From the equation above, we get:\n    *dN*/*dp* = 4πρ / *p*⁴\n\nThis shows that the number of stars per unit parallax is proportional to 1/*p*⁴ (or 1/plx⁴). This relationship is a fundamental concept in stellar statistics and is related to the Lutz-Kelker bias, which accounts for observational biases when determining stellar distances and luminosities.\n\nTherefore, assuming a uniform distribution of stars in the sky, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx as ~ 1/plx⁴.\n\n<<<B>>>"
