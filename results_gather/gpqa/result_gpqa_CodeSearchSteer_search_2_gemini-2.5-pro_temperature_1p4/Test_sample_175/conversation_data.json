    "To determine the probability of obtaining 0 for the measurement of observable P and -1 for the measurement of observable Q, we follow the principles of quantum mechanics for sequential measurements.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n1.  **Normalize the Initial State:** The initial state of the system is given by the column matrix `|ψ⟩ = (-1, 2, 1)`. First, we need to normalize this state.\n    *   The squared norm of the state is `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + (2)² + (1)² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`.\n    *   The normalized state is `|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]`.\n\n2.  **Find Eigenvalues and Eigenvector of Operator P:** The operator P is given by the matrix:\n    `P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n    The problem requires the probability of measuring the value 0 for P. This value must be one of the eigenvalues of P. The eigenvalues (λ) are found by solving the characteristic equation `det(P - λI) = 0`, which yields `λ(1 - λ²) = 0`. The eigenvalues are `λ = 0, 1, -1`.\n\n    Next, we find the normalized eigenvector `|p₀⟩` corresponding to the eigenvalue 0:\n    *   The eigenvector equation is `P|p₀⟩ = 0|p₀⟩`.\n    *   Solving this gives an eigenvector proportional to `[1, 0, -1]`.\n    *   The normalized eigenvector is `|p₀⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Probability of Measuring P=0:** According to the Born rule, the probability of measuring an eigenvalue is the square of the magnitude of the projection of the state vector onto the corresponding eigenvector.\n    *   `Prob(P=0) = |⟨p₀|ψ_norm⟩|²`\n    *   `⟨p₀|ψ_norm⟩ = ( (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1] ) · ( (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1] )`\n    *   `= (1/√12) * (1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1) = -2/√12 = -1/√3`\n    *   `Prob(P=0) = |-1/√3|² = 1/3`\n\n4.  **State Collapse:** After measuring P and obtaining the result 0, the system's state collapses to the corresponding eigenvector `|p₀⟩`. The new state of the system `|ψ'⟩` is:\n    *   `|ψ'⟩ = |p₀⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]`\n\n5.  **Find Eigenvalues and Eigenvector of Operator Q:** The operator Q is given by the matrix:\n    `Q = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]]`\n    Since Q is a diagonal matrix, its eigenvalues are the diagonal elements: `1, 0, -1`. We are interested in the outcome `Q=-1`.\n    *   The normalized eigenvector `|q₋₁⟩` corresponding to the eigenvalue -1 is `[0, 0, 1]`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Probability of Measuring Q=-1:** Now, we calculate the probability of measuring Q=-1 in the new state `|ψ'⟩`.\n    *   `Prob(Q=-1 after P=0) = |⟨q₋₁|ψ'⟩|²`\n    *   `⟨q₋₁|ψ'⟩ = [0, 0, 1] · ( (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1] )`\n    *   `= (1/√2) * (0*1 + 0*0 + 1*(-1)) = -1/√2`\n    *   `Prob(Q=-1 after P=0) = |-1/√2|² = 1/2`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Total Probability:** The probability of a sequence of measurements is the product of the individual probabilities.\n    *   `Total Probability = Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1 after P=0)`\n    *   `Total Probability = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6`\n\nTherefore, the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements is 1/6.\n\n<<<C>>>"
