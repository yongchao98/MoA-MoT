    "To determine the total energy of the Lithium-6 nucleus traveling at 0.96c, we must use the principles of special relativity.\n\n### 1. Identify the Nucleus and its Rest Mass\nThe nucleus X is defined as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons.\n*   Lithium has an atomic number of 3, meaning it has 3 protons.\n*   With 3 neutrons, the total number of nucleons (protons + neutrons) is 3 + 3 = 6.\n*   Therefore, the nucleus is Lithium-6 ($^6$Li).\n\nThe atomic mass of a Lithium-6 atom is 6.015122887 atomic mass units (u). This value includes the mass of its 3 electrons. The mass of the nucleus alone is slightly less, at 6.0134771 u. For calculations involving accelerators, the energy is applied to the ion (nucleus plus any remaining electrons), so we will use the atomic mass for better accuracy in a real-world scenario.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Rest Energy (E₀)\nThe rest energy is the energy equivalent of the rest mass, given by Einstein's equation E=mc².\n*   First, we convert the atomic mass from atomic mass units (u) to GeV/c².\n*   The conversion factor is 1 u = 931.4941 MeV/c² = 0.9314941 GeV/c².\n*   Rest mass m₀ = 6.015122887 u\n*   Rest energy E₀ = 6.015122887 u * 0.9314941 GeV/u\n*   **E₀ ≈ 5.603 GeV**\n\n### 3. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)\nThe Lorentz factor accounts for the relativistic effects of moving close to the speed of light.\n*   The speed v is given as 0.96c, where c is the speed of light.\n*   The formula for the Lorentz factor is: γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - (0.96c)²/c²)\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.96²)\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.9216)\n*   γ = 1 / √0.0784\n*   γ = 1 / 0.28\n*   **γ ≈ 3.5714**\n\n### 4. Calculate the Total Relativistic Energy (E)\nThe total energy is the product of the Lorentz factor and the rest energy.\n*   The formula for total energy is: E = γ * E₀\n*   E ≈ 3.5714 * 5.603 GeV\n*   **E ≈ 20.011 GeV**\n\n### 5. Compare with the Given Options\nThe calculated total energy is approximately 20.011 GeV. Comparing this with the provided choices:\nA) 23.069 GeV\nB) 20.132 GeV\nC) 21.419 GeV\nD) 18.475 GeV\n\nOur calculated value of 20.011 GeV is closest to option B, 20.132 GeV. The minor difference (~0.6%) can be attributed to slight variations in the physical constants or rounding used in the source of the problem.\n\n<<<B>>>"
