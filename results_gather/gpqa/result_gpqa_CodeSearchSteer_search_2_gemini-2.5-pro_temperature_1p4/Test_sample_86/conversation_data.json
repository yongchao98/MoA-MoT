    "To identify the correct 1H NMR data, we must first deduce the structure of the compound from the given information.\n\n1.  **Molecular Composition**: The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, which is a benzene ring with two substituents. The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms. The total carbon count is 8, leaving 2 carbons for the substituents.\n\n2.  **Functional Groups**: The FTIR spectrum indicates a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. This means a halogen atom is directly attached to the benzene ring, and the carbonyl group must be part of the other substituent.\n\n3.  **Structure of Substituents**:\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (let's denote it as -X).\n    *   The other substituent must contain the remaining two carbon atoms and the carbonyl group. The only common and stable arrangement for this is an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n\n4.  **Overall Structure**: The compound is a halo-acetophenone. Its molecular formula is C8H7XO. The two substituents, the halogen (-X) and the acetyl group (-COCH3), are attached to the benzene ring. There are three possible isomers: ortho, meta, and para.\n\n5.  **Analysis of 1H NMR Data**: We need to determine which substitution pattern (ortho, meta, or para) matches the provided NMR options.\n    *   **Acetyl Group**: The methyl group (-CH3) of the acetyl substituent is isolated and will appear as a singlet, integrating to 3 protons (3H, s). Its chemical shift is typically around 2.3-2.6 ppm.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons**: The pattern of the aromatic protons (on the benzene ring) depends on the substitution pattern.\n        *   **Ortho- and Meta-substitution**: These patterns would result in four distinct signals for the four aromatic protons, creating a complex multiplet pattern.\n        *   **Para-substitution (1,4-disubstituted)**: Due to the symmetry of the molecule, the four aromatic protons are chemically equivalent in two pairs. This results in a characteristic pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region (typically 7-8 ppm), with each doublet integrating to 2 protons (2H, d).\n\n6.  **Evaluating the Options**:\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**: This spectrum shows two doublets in the aromatic region, each for 2 protons, which is the hallmark of a para-substituted aromatic ring. It also shows a singlet for 3 protons at 2.3 ppm, corresponding to the acetyl methyl group. This data perfectly matches the structure of a para-haloacetophenone (e.g., 4-chloroacetophenone or 4-bromoacetophenone). For instance, the 1H NMR data for 4-chloroacetophenone is δ 7.91 (d, 2H), 7.45 (d, 2H), and 2.61 (s, 3H). Similarly, for 4-bromoacetophenone, the data is δ 7.83-7.84 (q, 2H), 7.61-7.63 (q, 2H), and 2.60 (s, 3H), where the signals are essentially doublets. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group are more deshielded and appear at a higher chemical shift (downfield) compared to the protons ortho to the halogen.\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**: The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton, not a ketone from an acetyl group.\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**: The signals at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are not in the aromatic proton region (which is typically 6-8.5 ppm).\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**: This option also lacks the characteristic signals for the proposed aromatic structure.\n\nBased on the analysis, the compound is a para-haloacetophenone, and the NMR data in option A is the only one that correctly represents this structure.\n\n<<<A>>>"
