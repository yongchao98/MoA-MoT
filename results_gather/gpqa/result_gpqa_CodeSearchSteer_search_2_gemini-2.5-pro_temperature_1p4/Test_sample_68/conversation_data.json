    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the required minimum resolution.\n\n### 1. Identify Given Parameters\n*   Proper lifetime of particle X⁰ ($ \\tau_0 $): $ 8 \\times 10^{-16} $ s\n*   Energy in the Bubble Chamber: 27 GeV\n*   Mass of particle X⁰ ($ m_0 $): 3.41 GeV/c²\n\n### 2. Determine Total Energy\nIn particle physics, unless specified otherwise, \"energy\" can refer to either total energy or kinetic energy. Let's evaluate the situation assuming the given energy is kinetic energy, a common convention for accelerator experiments.\n*   Kinetic Energy (KE) = 27 GeV\n*   Total Energy (E) = Kinetic Energy (KE) + Rest Mass Energy ($ m_0c^2 $)\n*   E = 27 GeV + 3.41 GeV = 30.41 GeV\n\n### 3. Calculate Relativistic Factors\nThe Lorentz factor ($ \\gamma $) is the ratio of the particle's total energy to its rest mass energy.\n*   $ \\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2} = \\frac{30.41 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 8.918 $\n\nThe particle's velocity is represented by $ \\beta = v/c $, which can be calculated from $ \\gamma $.\n*   $ \\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{8.918^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.01256} \\approx 0.9937 $\n\n### 4. Calculate the Mean Decay Length\nThe question asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe the decays. This is best interpreted as the particle's average distance traveled before decay, known as the mean decay length (L). Due to time dilation, the particle's lifetime in the lab frame ($ \\tau $) is longer than its proper lifetime ($ \\tau_0 $). The mean decay length is the distance the particle travels at its velocity (v = $ \\beta $c) during this dilated lifetime.\n\nThe formula for the mean decay length is:\n$ L = v \\cdot \\tau = (\\beta c) \\cdot (\\gamma \\tau_0) = \\beta\\gamma c \\tau_0 $\n\nNow, substitute the values:\n*   $ c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8 $ m/s\n*   $ \\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16} $ s\n*   $ \\beta\\gamma = \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1} = \\sqrt{8.918^2 - 1} \\approx \\sqrt{78.53} \\approx 8.862 $\n\n$ L = 8.862 \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) $\n$ L \\approx 2.127 \\times 10^{-6} $ m\n\n### 5. Compare with Options and Conclusion\nThe calculated mean decay length is approximately $ 2.13 \\times 10^{-6} $ m. This value is very close to option B.\n\n*   A) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\n*   **B) 2.08 * 1e-6 m**\n*   C) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\n*   D) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\n\nThe small discrepancy between the calculated value ($ 2.13 \\times 10^{-6} $ m) and the option ($ 2.08 \\times 10^{-6} $ m) is likely due to rounding or the precise values of constants used in the problem's formulation.\n\nThe condition \"to observe at least 30% of the decays\" is satisfied with a resolution on the order of the mean decay length. After traveling one mean decay length (L), the fraction of particles that have decayed is $ 1 - e^{-1} \\approx 0.632 $, or 63.2%, which is greater than 30%. Therefore, a resolution of this scale is sufficient.\n\n<<<B>>>"
