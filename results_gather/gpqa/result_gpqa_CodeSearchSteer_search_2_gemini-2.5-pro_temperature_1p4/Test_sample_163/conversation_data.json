    "To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we need to calculate the ratio of their total masses (M1 / M2). The mass of a binary system can be derived from the orbital period and the radial velocities of its component stars.\n\n### Key Principles\n\nFor a double-lined spectroscopic binary system, the total mass (M = m1 + m2) is related to the orbital period (P) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocity curves (K1 and K2) by the following formula, derived from Kepler's third law:\n\nM = [P * (K1 + K2)³] / [2πG * sin³(i)]\n\nwhere:\n*   **P** is the orbital period.\n*   **K1** and **K2** are the radial velocity amplitudes of the two stars.\n*   **G** is the gravitational constant.\n*   **i** is the inclination of the orbital plane to our line of sight.\n\nThe problem states that both systems exhibit eclipses. This is a crucial piece of information, as eclipses only occur when the orbital inclination `i` is close to 90 degrees. For i ≈ 90°, sin(i) ≈ 1, and therefore sin³(i) ≈ 1. This simplifies the mass calculation significantly.\n\n### Mass Ratio Calculation\n\nWe can set up a ratio of the masses of the two systems, which causes the constant terms (2πG) to cancel out.\n\nM1 / M2 = { [P1 * (K1a + K1b)³] / [2πG * sin³(i1)] } / { [P2 * (K2a + K2b)³] / [2πG * sin³(i2)] }\n\nAssuming sin(i1) ≈ sin(i2) ≈ 1, the equation simplifies to:\n\nM1 / M2 = (P1 / P2) * [ (K1a + K1b) / (K2a + K2b) ]³\n\n### Given Data\n\n**System 1:**\n*   Period (P1) = 2 years\n*   Radial Velocity Amplitudes (K1a, K1b) = 10 km/s and 5 km/s\n*   Sum of amplitudes (K1a + K1b) = 15 km/s\n\n**System 2:**\n*   Period (P2) = 1 year\n*   Radial Velocity Amplitudes (K2a, K2b) = 15 km/s and 10 km/s\n*   Sum of amplitudes (K2a + K2b) = 25 km/s\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n1.  **Calculate the ratio of the periods (P1 / P2):**\n    P1 / P2 = 2 years / 1 year = 2\n\n2.  **Calculate the ratio of the summed velocity amplitudes:**\n    (K1a + K1b) / (K2a + K2b) = 15 km/s / 25 km/s = 3 / 5 = 0.6\n\n3.  **Cube the velocity amplitude ratio:**\n    (0.6)³ = 0.216\n\n4.  **Multiply the period ratio by the cubed velocity ratio to find the mass ratio:**\n    M1 / M2 = 2 * 0.216 = 0.432\n\nThe calculated mass ratio of system_1 to system_2 is approximately 0.432. This means system_1 is about 0.432 times as massive as system_2. Comparing this result to the given options:\n\n*   A) ~ 0.4\n*   B) ~ 0.6\n*   C) ~ 1.2\n*   D) ~ 0.7\n\nThe calculated value of 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
