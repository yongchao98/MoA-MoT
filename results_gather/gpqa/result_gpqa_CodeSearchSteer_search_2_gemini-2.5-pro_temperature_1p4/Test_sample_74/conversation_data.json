    "The inability to overexpress the protein construct is due to a premature termination of translation by the ribosome. A detailed analysis of the provided DNA sequence reveals the issue.\n\nThe DNA sequence is intended to code for a GADD45G protein with an influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag at its N-terminus. The translation process starts at the `ATG` codon. The sequence immediately following the start codon is `TACCCATACGATGTTC CAGATTACGCC`, which correctly codes for the amino acid sequence of the HA tag (YPYDVPDYA).\n\nHowever, immediately after the sequence for the HA tag and one additional codon (`AAA`, coding for Lysine), there is a `TGA` codon. In the genetic code, `TGA` (or UGA in the corresponding mRNA) is one of the three stop codons, along with `TAA` (UAA) and `TAG` (UAG). When the ribosome encounters this codon during translation, it halts protein synthesis and releases the incomplete polypeptide chain. This event is known as a premature termination codon (PTC) or a nonsense mutation, and it results in the production of a truncated, non-functional protein, explaining the failure to detect the full-length protein.\n\nThe other options can be ruled out:\n*   **A) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse:** The problematic codon is `TGA`, not `TAA`. Furthermore, stop codons are recognized by release factors, not tRNAs, which is a universal mechanism.\n*   **C) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation:** The DNA sequence for the HA tag correctly corresponds to the standard YPYDVPDYA peptide sequence.\n*   **D) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain:** While linkers can sometimes be important, their absence does not inherently cause proteolysis. The presence of a premature stop codon is a more direct and definitive cause for the lack of a full-length protein product.\n\n<<<B>>>"
