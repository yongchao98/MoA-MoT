    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each reaction to determine the correct reactants and products.\n\n### Reaction A:\n*   **Reactants:** Dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) in ethanol (EtOH)\n*   **Reaction Type:** Michael Addition\n\n1.  **Nucleophile Formation:** The base, sodium ethoxide, deprotonates the acidic α-carbon of dimethyl malonate, `CH₂(COOCH₃)₂`, to form a resonance-stabilized enolate, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n2.  **Michael Attack:** This enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated ester, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate (`p-tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`).\n3.  **Protonation:** The resulting intermediate is protonated by the solvent (ethanol) to yield the final product.\n\nThe new bond forms between the α-carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate. The structure of the product is:\n`p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) -CH₂-COOCH₃`\n\nTo name this compound, we identify the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional groups. This is a propane chain with three methoxycarbonyl groups (tricarboxylate).\n*   Numbering the propane chain `C1-C2-C3`:\n    *   `C1` has two methoxycarbonyl groups: `CH(COOCH₃)₂`\n    *   `C2` has a p-tolyl group.\n    *   `C3` is part of a `CH₂COOCH₃` group.\nThus, the correct IUPAC name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Reactants:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile\n*   **Reagents:** Methanol (MeOH), followed by acidic workup (H₃O⁺)\n*   **Reaction Type:** Stork Enamine Synthesis (a type of Michael Addition)\n\n1.  **Nucleophile:** The enamine, 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine (formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine), serves as the nucleophile. The nucleophilic carbon is the β-carbon of the original enone (the C2 of the cyclohexene ring).\n2.  **Michael Attack:** The enamine attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`).\n3.  **Hydrolysis:** The resulting iminium salt intermediate is hydrolyzed by the acidic workup (H₃O⁺) to regenerate the ketone. This removes the piperidine and restores the carbonyl group at C1 of the cyclohexane ring.\n\nThe bond forms between C2 of the cyclohexane ring and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. The side chain attached to the cyclohexane ring is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂CN`.\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexanone. The substituent is located at the C2 position (alpha to the carbonyl). To name the product, we consider the butanenitrile chain as the parent. The substituent is the 2-oxocyclohexyl group attached to the third carbon of the nitrile chain (`N≡C¹-C²H₂-C³H-`). Therefore, the name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   **Reactants:** C + but-3-en-2-one\n*   **Reagents:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) in water (H₂O)\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n*   **Reaction Type:** Michael Addition (retrosynthesis)\n\nWe need to identify reactant C by analyzing the product and the other reactant.\n1.  **Michael Acceptor:** The reactant but-3-en-2-one (`CH₂(β)=CH(α)-CO-CH₃`), also known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK), is the Michael acceptor.\n2.  **Bond Formation Analysis:** The product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. The 3-oxobutyl group, `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`, is formed from the Michael acceptor, MVK, after it accepts the nucleophile at the β-carbon and gets protonated.\n3.  **Identifying the Nucleophile (Michael Donor):** The 3-oxobutyl group is attached to the C2 position of a cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring. This implies that the nucleophile was the enolate of **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**. The proton at C2 of cyclohexane-1,3-dione is particularly acidic because it is flanked by two carbonyl groups, making it readily deprotonated by KOH to form the nucleophilic enolate.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis of the three reactions:\n*   **A** is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n*   **B** is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.\n*   **C** is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\nThis combination of reactants and products matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
