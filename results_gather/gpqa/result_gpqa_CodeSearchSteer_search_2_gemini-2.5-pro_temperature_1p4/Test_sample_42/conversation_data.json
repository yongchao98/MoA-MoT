    "To determine the correct IUPAC name for the given molecule, we must follow a systematic approach based on IUPAC nomenclature rules.\n\n**1. Identify the Principal Functional Group and Parent Compound:**\nThe molecule contains several functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH), a carbaldehyde (-CHO), a cyano group (-CN), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2), and a methoxy group (-OCH3). According to IUPAC priority rules, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority. Therefore, the parent compound is benzoic acid, and the carbon atom to which the carboxylic acid is attached is designated as C1.\n\n**2. Determine the Positions of the Substituents:**\nBased on the description:\n*   The carboxylic acid (-COOH) is at C1.\n*   A carbaldehyde (-CHO) is meta to the carboxylic acid (i.e., at C3 or C5).\n*   A cyano group (-CN) is meta to the carboxylic acid (i.e., at C3 or C5).\n*   The carbaldehyde and cyano group are also meta to one another. If we place the carboxylic acid at C1 and the carbaldehyde at C3, the cyano group must be at C5 to be meta to both the C1 and C3 positions.\n*   A methoxy group (-OCH3) is para to the carboxylic acid, placing it at C4.\n*   A hydroxyl group (-OH) is ortho to the carboxylic acid (i.e., at C2 or C6).\n*   A dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2) is ortho to the carboxylic acid (i.e., at C2 or C6).\n*   Crucially, the methoxy group (at C4) and the hydroxyl group are both ortho to the cyano group (at C5). The ortho positions relative to C5 are C4 and C6. Since C4 is occupied by the methoxy group, the hydroxyl group must be at C6.\n*   This leaves the C2 position for the dimethylamino group, which is consistent with it being ortho to the carboxylic acid.\n\nThis gives the following arrangement:\n*   **C1:** -COOH\n*   **C2:** -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n*   **C3:** -CHO (formyl)\n*   **C4:** -OCH3 (methoxy)\n*   **C5:** -CN (cyano)\n*   **C6:** -OH (hydroxy)\n\n**3. Number the Ring and Apply Naming Rules:**\nWith the principal functional group at C1, we must number the ring to give the lowest possible locants (numbers) to the other substituents. We have two possibilities for numbering the ring:\n*   **Path A (Clockwise):** Substituents are at positions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n*   **Path B (Counter-clockwise from C1):** This would mean C2 is hydroxyl, C3 is cyano, etc. The substituent positions would also be 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n\nSince both numbering directions result in the same set of locants {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, we must use the alphabetical order of the substituents as a tie-breaker. The rule is to assign the lowest number to the substituent that comes first alphabetically.\n\nThe substituents listed alphabetically are: **c**yano, **d**imethylamino, **f**ormyl, **h**ydroxy, **m**ethoxy.\n\nLet's compare the numbering for these substituents in each path:\n*   **Path A (Clockwise):**\n    *   cyano at C5\n    *   dimethylamino at C2\n    *   formyl at C3\n    *   hydroxy at C6\n    *   methoxy at C4\n*   **Path B (Counter-clockwise):**\n    *   cyano at C3\n    *   dimethylamino at C6\n    *   formyl at C5\n    *   hydroxy at C2\n    *   methoxy at C4\n\nComparing the first substituent alphabetically, \"cyano\", it gets locant 3 in Path B versus locant 5 in Path A. Therefore, Path B (counter-clockwise numbering) is the correct choice as it assigns a lower number to the alphabetically first substituent.\n\n**4. Assemble the Final Name:**\nUsing the counter-clockwise numbering, the substituent positions are:\n*   **C2:** Hydroxy\n*   **C3:** Cyano\n*   **C4:** Methoxy\n*   **C5:** Formyl\n*   **C6:** Dimethylamino\n\nNow, we list the substituents alphabetically, each preceded by its position number, followed by the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n\n*   3-cyano-\n*   6-(dimethylamino)-\n*   5-formyl-\n*   2-hydroxy-\n*   4-methoxy-\n*   benzoic acid\n\nThe complete and correct IUPAC name is **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
