    "### Analysis of the Reactions and Products\n\n**Reaction I:**\nThe starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, a chiral ketone. It is treated with Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup.\n*   The reduction of the ketone at the C3 position creates a new stereocenter.\n*   Since the starting material is a single enantiomer ((S) at C5) and the reducing agent (LAH) is achiral, the reaction produces a mixture of two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   These two products are diastereomers because they have different configurations at one chiral center (C3) but the same configuration at another (C5).\n\n**Reaction II:**\nThe starting material is pentane-2,4-dione, an achiral dione. It is treated with excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4), which reduces both ketone groups, followed by an acidic workup. The product is pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   This reaction creates two new stereocenters at positions C2 and C4.\n*   Three stereoisomers are formed from this reaction:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are a pair of enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   The (2R, 4S) isomer has a plane of symmetry and is therefore an achiral meso compound. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\nIn total, five different compounds are produced from the two reactions.\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis\n\nThe combined products from both reactions are analyzed using two types of HPLC.\n\n**Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column):**\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It cannot separate enantiomers.\n*   **From Reaction I:** The two products are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated by normal-phase HPLC. This will result in **two peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** The products are a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n    *   The enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will therefore elute together as a single peak.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers, meaning it has different physical properties and will be separated, appearing as a distinct peak.\n    *   This will result in a total of **two peaks** from Reaction II's products.\n*   **Total Peaks:** The two diastereomers from Reaction I and the two groups of stereoisomers (the enantiomeric pair and the meso compound) from Reaction II are all structurally distinct molecules with different polarities. Therefore, they will all be separated from each other.\n    *   Total Peaks = 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Chiral HPLC (Chiral Stationary Phase):**\nAn HPLC with a chiral stationary phase is designed to separate enantiomers in addition to other isomers.\n*   **From Reaction I:** The two diastereomers will be separated, just as they were on the normal-phase column. This gives **two peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:**\n    *   The chiral column will now resolve the pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) into **two separate peaks**.\n    *   The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the other two, will elute as its own **one peak**.\n    *   This results in a total of **three peaks** from Reaction II's products.\n*   **Total Peaks:** The total number of unique compounds is five, and a chiral column has the ability to separate all of them.\n    *   Total Peaks = 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 peaks**.\n\nBased on this analysis, the chemist will observe 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<D>>>"
