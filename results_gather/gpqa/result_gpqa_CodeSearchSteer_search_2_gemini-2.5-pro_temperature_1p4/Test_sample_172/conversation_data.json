    "To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy (ΔE) of the electron, we will use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and the relationship between a particle's energy and momentum.\n\n### Step 1: Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle\n\nThe Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties, such as position and momentum, can be known simultaneously. The mathematical relation for the minimum uncertainty is:\n\nΔx * Δp ≥ ħ / 2\n\nwhere:\n*   **Δx** is the uncertainty in position.\n*   **Δp** is the uncertainty in momentum.\n*   **ħ** is the reduced Planck constant (h/2π), approximately 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s.\n\nTo find the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp), we use the equality:\n\nΔp = ħ / (2 * Δx)\n\nGiven:\n*   Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 x 10⁻⁹ m = 10⁻¹⁰ m\n\nCalculation for Δp:\nΔp = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 * 10⁻¹⁰ m)\nΔp = 0.527 x 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s\n\n### Step 2: Relating Energy and Momentum Uncertainty\n\nFor a particle, the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) can be related to the uncertainty in momentum (Δp). The relationship is derived from the energy-momentum equation (E² = p²c² + m₀²c⁴ for relativistic cases, and E = p²/2m for non-relativistic cases). In both scenarios, the derived relationship for the uncertainties is:\n\nΔE = v * Δp\n\nwhere **v** is the velocity of the particle.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Minimum Uncertainty in Energy\n\nNow, we can calculate the minimum uncertainty in the electron's energy (ΔE) using the given velocity and the calculated uncertainty in momentum.\n\nGiven:\n*   v = 2 x 10⁸ m/s\n*   Δp ≈ 0.527 x 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s\n\nCalculation for ΔE:\nΔE = (2 x 10⁸ m/s) * (0.527 x 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s)\nΔE ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe estimated minimum uncertainty in the energy of the electron is approximately 1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ Joules. This value is closest to 10⁻¹⁶ J.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~10⁻¹⁹ J\nB) ~10⁻¹⁶ J\nC) ~10⁻¹⁷ J\nD) ~10⁻¹⁸ J\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
