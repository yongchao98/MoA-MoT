    "### Calculation Breakdown\n\nThe problem asks for the relative radius of a hypothetical exoplanet (`R_pl/R_star`) that would cause a transit signal of the same amplitude as the brightness variation from a rotating spotted star.\n\n1.  **Modeling the Star's Brightness Variation:** The star's brightness changes as it rotates, showing its spotted and unspotted hemispheres.\n    *   **Maximum Brightness (F_max):** This occurs when the completely unspotted hemisphere is facing the observer. The flux is proportional to the effective temperature to the fourth power, based on the Stefan-Boltzmann law (Flux ∝ T⁴).\n        *   `F_max ∝ T_eff⁴`\n    *   **Minimum Brightness (F_min):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere faces the observer. This hemisphere is 20% covered by cool spots (filling factor `f = 0.2`) and 80% is at the normal effective temperature.\n        *   Spot Temperature: `T_spot = T_eff - 1000K = 6000K - 1000K = 5000K`\n        *   The total flux from this hemisphere is a weighted average of the flux from the normal and spotted areas.\n        *   `F_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴`\n\n2.  **Calculating the Signal Amplitude:** The amplitude of the brightness variation due to the spots is the relative drop in flux.\n    *   `Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max`\n    *   Substituting the expressions for flux:\n        `Amplitude = (T_eff⁴ - [(1-f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴]) / T_eff⁴`\n    *   This simplifies to:\n        `Amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)`\n    *   Plugging in the given values:\n        *   `f = 0.20`\n        *   `T_eff = 6000 K`\n        *   `T_spot = 5000 K`\n    *   `Amplitude = 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴)`\n    *   `Amplitude = 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)⁴)`\n    *   `Amplitude = 0.20 * (1 - 625 / 1296)`\n    *   `Amplitude ≈ 0.20 * (1 - 0.48225)`\n    *   `Amplitude ≈ 0.20 * 0.51775`\n    *   `Amplitude ≈ 0.10355`\n\n3.  **Equating to an Exoplanet Transit:** The problem states this amplitude is the same as the signal from a transiting exoplanet. The signal from a transit (the transit depth) on an otherwise unspotted star is the ratio of the planet's area to the star's disk area.\n    *   `Transit Depth = (Area_planet / Area_star) = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²`\n\n4.  **Solving for the Planet's Relative Radius:**\n    *   `(R_pl / R_star)² = Amplitude`\n    *   `(R_pl / R_star)² ≈ 0.10355`\n    *   `R_pl / R_star ≈ sqrt(0.10355)`\n    *   `R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218`\n\nThis calculated value is approximately 0.32.\n\n<<<B>>>"
