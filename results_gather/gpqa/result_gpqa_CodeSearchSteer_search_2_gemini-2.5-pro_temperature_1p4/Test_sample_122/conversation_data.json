    "This problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1.  **Identify the given information:**\n    *   The relative velocity (v) between the ejecta and the center of the Galaxy is 60,000 km/s.\n    *   The time elapsed in the ejecta's reference frame (the proper time, Δt₀) is 50 seconds.\n    *   The speed of light (c) is approximately 300,000 km/s.\n\n2.  **Understand the frames of reference:**\n    *   The \"Galaxy reference frame\" is the stationary frame (S).\n    *   The \"ejecta reference frame\" is the moving frame (S').\n\n3.  **Determine the goal:**\n    *   Calculate the distance the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame. The formula for this distance is `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame.\n\n4.  **Apply the time dilation formula:**\n    Time dilation means that time passes slower for a moving object relative to a stationary observer. The time measured in the stationary frame (`Δt`) is related to the proper time measured in the moving frame (`Δt₀`) by the Lorentz factor (γ).\n\n    *   The time dilation formula is: `Δt = γ * Δt₀`.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is calculated as: `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):**\n    *   First, find the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light:\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Now, calculate γ:\n        `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √0.96`\n    *   `√0.96 ≈ 0.9798`\n    *   `γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206`\n\n6.  **Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy reference frame (Δt):**\n    *   Using the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀ ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`\n\n7.  **Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy reference frame (d):**\n    *   Using the distance formula `d = v * Δt`:\n        `d = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,800 km`\n\n    Alternatively, a more precise calculation without intermediate rounding:\n    *   `d = v * Δt = v * (Δt₀ / √(1 - v²/c²))`\n    *   `d = (60,000 km/s * 50 s) / √0.96`\n    *   `d = 3,000,000 km / √0.96`\n    *   `d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.979796`\n    *   `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n8.  **Compare the result with the given options:**\n    The calculated distance of approximately 3,061,862 km is closest to option A.\n\n    *   A) 3,060,000 km\n    *   B) 2,880,000 km\n    *   C) 3,000,000 km (This would be the non-relativistic answer)\n    *   D) 2,940,000 km\n\nThe slight difference between the calculated value and option A is likely due to rounding in the problem's design.\n\n<<<A>>>"
