    "The user is asking for the threshold energy of a high-energy gamma-ray (γ) that can annihilate with a Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photon to produce an electron-positron pair (e⁺e⁻).\n\n### 1. Physical Principle\n\nThe process is γγ → e⁺e⁻. For this reaction to occur, the total energy in the center-of-mass frame must be at least the rest mass energy of the created electron-positron pair. The threshold energy corresponds to the minimum energy the high-energy photon must have for the reaction to be possible. This occurs under the most efficient condition, which is a head-on collision.\n\n### 2. Formula Derivation\n\nLet:\n*   E_γ be the energy of the high-energy gamma-ray.\n*   E_CMB be the energy of the CMB photon.\n*   mₑc² be the rest mass energy of an electron (which is the same for a positron).\n\nThe total rest mass energy of the products is 2mₑc².\n\nThe condition for the threshold energy in a head-on collision between two photons is given by the formula:\n\nE_γ * E_CMB = (mₑc²)²\n\nThis formula arises from the conservation of four-momentum, where the invariant mass squared of the initial two-photon system must equal the invariant mass squared of the final electron-positron pair at rest in the center-of-mass frame.\n\n### 3. Values\n\n*   **Rest mass energy of an electron (mₑc²):** This is a fundamental physical constant, approximately 0.511 MeV.\n*   **Average energy of a CMB photon (E_CMB):** Provided in the question as 10⁻³ eV.\n\n### 4. Calculation\n\nFirst, we need to ensure all units are consistent. Let's use electron-volts (eV).\n\n*   mₑc² = 0.511 MeV = 0.511 * 10⁶ eV\n*   E_CMB = 10⁻³ eV\n\nNow, rearrange the formula to solve for E_γ:\n\nE_γ = (mₑc²)² / E_CMB\n\nSubstitute the values:\n\nE_γ = (0.511 * 10⁶ eV)² / (10⁻³ eV)\nE_γ = (0.261121 * 10¹² eV²) / (10⁻³ eV)\nE_γ = 0.261121 * 10¹⁵ eV\nE_γ = 2.61121 * 10¹⁴ eV\n\nThe options are given in giga-electron-volts (GeV). We convert our result to GeV:\n1 GeV = 10⁹ eV\n\nE_γ = (2.61121 * 10¹⁴ eV) / (10⁹ eV/GeV)\nE_γ = 2.61121 * 10⁵ GeV\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe calculated threshold energy for the high-energy gamma-ray is approximately 2.61 * 10⁵ GeV. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 2.6*1e5 GeV\nB) 9.5*1e4 GeV\nC) 3.9*1e5 GeV\nD) 1.8*1e5 GeV\n\nThe calculated value matches option A. This energy marks the threshold above which the universe becomes increasingly opaque to gamma-rays due to pair production with CMB photons, thus limiting their travel distance (lifetime) across cosmic scales.\n\n<<<A>>>"
