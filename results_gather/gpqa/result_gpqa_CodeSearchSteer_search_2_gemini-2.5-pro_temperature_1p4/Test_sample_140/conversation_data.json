    "The reaction of 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene with sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia is a classic example of an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate. The strong base, amide (NH2-), initiates the reaction.\n\nTwo distinct pathways are possible for the formation of the benzyne intermediate, leading to different products:\n\n**Pathway 1: Abstraction of a proton (H)**\n\n*   The amide ion can abstract a proton from the C-6 position (ortho to the bromine). The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond, so this is the kinetically favored process.\n*   Loss of the bromide ion from C-1 results in the formation of a **3-deuterobenzyne** intermediate. The triple bond is between C-1 and C-6, and the deuterium atom remains at C-2.\n*   The nucleophile (NH2-) can then attack either carbon of the benzyne triple bond:\n    *   Attack at C-1 leads to the formation of **3-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   Attack at C-6 leads to the formation of **2-deuteroaniline**.\n\n**Pathway 2: Abstraction of a deuteron (D)**\n\n*   Although less likely due to the kinetic isotope effect, the amide ion can also abstract the deuteron from the C-2 position.\n*   Subsequent loss of the bromide ion from C-1 forms a standard **benzyne** intermediate, as the deuterium atom has been removed.\n*   Attack of the nucleophile (NH2-) on this symmetric intermediate, followed by protonation from the ammonia solvent, yields a single product: **aniline** (with no deuterium).\n\nTherefore, combining the outcomes of both possible pathways, a total of three distinct organic products can be formed:\n\n1.  2-deuteroaniline\n2.  3-deuteroaniline\n3.  Aniline\n\nThus, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>"
