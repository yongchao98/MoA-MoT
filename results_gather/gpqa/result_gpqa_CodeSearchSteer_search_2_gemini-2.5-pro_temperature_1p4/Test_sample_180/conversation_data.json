    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the approximate flux ratio.\n\n### 1. Identify Neutrino Sources in Each Energy Band\n\nFirst, let's identify which solar neutrino sources contribute to the specified energy bands under the hypothetical scenario. The problem states that the **pp-III branch has stopped**, which means the production of **Boron-8 (⁸B) neutrinos ceases**. All other reactions, including the rest of the pp-chain and the CNO cycle, continue as normal.\n\n*   **Band 1 (700-800 keV, or 0.7-0.8 MeV):**\n    *   **pp neutrinos:** Have energies only up to 420 keV, so they do not contribute.\n    *   **⁷Be neutrinos:** These are monoenergetic lines, with the main line at 861 keV, outside this band.\n    *   **⁸B neutrinos:** Their flux is zero according to the scenario.\n    *   **CNO cycle neutrinos:** Neutrinos from ¹³N (up to 1.20 MeV) and ¹⁵O (up to 1.73 MeV) have continuous spectra that cover this energy range.\n    *   **Conclusion for Band 1:** The only remaining flux comes from CNO cycle neutrinos (¹³N and ¹⁵O).\n\n*   **Band 2 (800-900 keV, or 0.8-0.9 MeV):**\n    *   **⁷Be neutrinos:** The pp-II branch produces a strong monoenergetic line of neutrinos at **861 keV**. This falls directly within Band 2 and is unaffected by the shutdown of the pp-III branch.\n    *   **⁸B neutrinos:** Their flux is zero.\n    *   **CNO cycle neutrinos:** The spectra of ¹³N and ¹⁵O also extend into this band.\n    *   **Conclusion for Band 2:** The flux is the sum of the very strong ⁷Be line at 861 keV and a smaller contribution from CNO cycle neutrinos.\n\n### 2. Formulate the Flux Ratio\n\nBased on the analysis above, the ratio we need to calculate is:\n\nFlux (Band 1) / Flux (Band 2) = (Flux from CNO in Band 1) / (Flux from ⁷Be line + Flux from CNO in Band 2)\n\n### 3. Compare the Magnitudes of the Fluxes\n\nTo find an approximate ratio, we need to compare the magnitudes of the contributing fluxes using data from Standard Solar Models:\n\n*   **Total Flux of the ⁷Be line (at 861 keV):** The total flux from ⁷Be is approximately 4.84 x 10⁹ neutrinos/cm²/s, with about 90% of this being the 861 keV line.\n    *   Flux (⁷Be line) ≈ 0.9 * 4.84 x 10⁹ ≈ **4.3 x 10⁹ cm⁻²s⁻¹**\n\n*   **Total Flux from the main CNO reactions (¹³N and ¹⁵O):**\n    *   Flux (¹³N) ≈ 2.8 x 10⁸ cm⁻²s⁻¹\n    *   Flux (¹⁵O) ≈ 2.1 x 10⁸ cm⁻²s⁻¹\n    *   Total Flux (CNO) ≈ 4.9 x 10⁸ cm⁻²s⁻¹\n\nNotice that the total flux of the ⁷Be line is about **9 times larger** than the total flux of the main CNO neutrinos (`4.3 x 10⁹` vs `4.9 x 10⁸`).\n\n### 4. Approximate the Ratio\n\nLet's simplify the ratio expression based on these magnitudes:\n\n1.  **Denominator:** The flux in Band 2 is composed of the ⁷Be line (`~4.3 x 10⁹`) plus the CNO contribution in that band. The CNO contribution in Band 2 is only a small fraction of the total CNO flux (`~4.9 x 10⁸`), making it negligible compared to the ⁷Be flux. Therefore, we can approximate:\n    *   Flux (Band 2) ≈ Flux (⁷Be line)\n\n2.  **Numerator:** The flux in Band 1 is the portion of the total CNO flux that falls within the 700-800 keV window. The CNO neutrino spectra peak at lower energies (~300-400 keV) and decrease from there. The 100 keV window of Band 1 represents a fraction of the total CNO spectrum. For an order-of-magnitude estimate, this fraction can be considered to be around 10% (0.1).\n\n3.  **Calculation:** The ratio becomes:\n    *   Ratio ≈ (Fraction of CNO flux in Band 1) * (Total CNO Flux) / (Total ⁷Be Line Flux)\n\n    Plugging in the relative values:\n    *   Ratio ≈ (A fraction, let's estimate ~0.1) * (Total CNO Flux / Total ⁷Be Line Flux)\n    *   Ratio ≈ 0.1 * (4.9 x 10⁸ / 4.3 x 10⁹)\n    *   Ratio ≈ 0.1 * 0.11\n    *   Ratio ≈ **0.011**\n\nThis value is very close to 0.01.\n\nFinal Answer: The approximate ratio of the neutrino flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV) to Band 2 (800-900 keV) is about 0.01.\n\n<<<C>>>"
