    "The observations provided point to a specific type of isomerism. Here is a breakdown of the evidence:\n\n*   **Â¹H NMR Data**: The spectrum shows two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton, which have nearly identical integrals that sum to the expected value of one proton. Standard spin-spin coupling has been excluded. This observation indicates the proton exists in two different chemical environments. Such a difference is characteristic of diastereomers, which are stereoisomers that are not mirror images and possess different physical and chemical properties, including distinct NMR spectra. Enantiomers, in contrast, are indistinguishable in a standard (achiral) NMR experiment.\n*   **LC-MS Data**: The analysis separates the crude material into two distinct peaks of equal intensity, yet both peaks yield the identical mass spectrum, which matches the expected molecule. This confirms the presence of two compounds that have the same mass (isomers) but are separable by chromatography due to different physical properties. This is a hallmark of diastereomers. Enantiomers cannot be separated on a standard (achiral) LC column. A precursor impurity (B) or a \"double coupling\" product (D) would have a different mass.\n*   **Compound Type**: The substance is a chemically synthesized peptidic compound. Peptide synthesis is known to be susceptible to side reactions that can alter stereochemistry. Two common phenomena can explain the formation of diastereomers in this context:\n    1.  **Epimerization**: The alpha-proton of an amino acid can be abstracted under certain conditions (often basic) during the coupling or deprotection steps of peptide synthesis. If this happens to an amino acid residue in a peptide that already contains other chiral centers, the result is the formation of a diastereomer. For example, epimerization of an L-amino acid to a D-amino acid within an all-L peptide creates a diastereomeric mixture.\n    2.  **Rotamers (Atropisomers)**: The amide (or peptide) bond has significant double-bond character, which restricts rotation around the C-N axis. This can lead to stable *cis* and *trans* conformers. In a chiral molecule, these rotamers are diastereomeric and can be distinguished by NMR, often appearing as two sets of peaks if the rotation is slow on the NMR timescale. The fact that the two peaks are still resolved in the LC at an elevated temperature suggests a significant energy barrier to rotation, which is characteristic of some rotamers.\n\nBoth epimerization and the presence of stable rotamers result in a mixture of diastereomers. Therefore, this is the most encompassing and accurate explanation for all the provided analytical data.\n\n<<<A>>>"
