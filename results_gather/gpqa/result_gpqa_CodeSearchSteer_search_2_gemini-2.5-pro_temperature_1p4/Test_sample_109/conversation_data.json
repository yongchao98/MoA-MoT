    "To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs, we must consider the observability criteria for both instruments, which include the star's apparent brightness and its position in the sky (declination).\n\n**Observability Criteria:**\n\n*   **ESPRESSO (Paranal Observatory, Chile):** Located in the Southern Hemisphere at a latitude of about -24.6 degrees, it can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude brighter than 17. Its view extends to northern declinations, with a technical safety limit near a zenith distance of 70 degrees, which translates to a northern declination limit of approximately +65 degrees.\n*   **HIRES (Keck Observatory, Hawaii):** Located in the Northern Hemisphere at a latitude of about +19.8 degrees, it can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude brighter than 16. The provided information indicates it is designed for objects out to V=20, but for this problem, we will adhere to the specified 16 mag limit. It can observe into the Southern Hemisphere, with pointing limits that depend on the specific telescope (Keck I or II) but are generally better than -70 degrees declination.\n\nFor a star to be observable by **both** spectrographs, it must meet the stricter of these conditions:\n1.  **Apparent V magnitude (m_V) must be brighter than 16.**\n2.  **Declination (DEC) must be between roughly -70 and +65 degrees.**\n\n### Analysis of Each Star:\n\n**Star 1:**\n*   **Declination:** -75 degrees.\n*   This star is too far south to be visible from the Keck Observatory in the Northern Hemisphere. Therefore, it cannot be observed by both.\n\n**Star 2:**\n*   **Apparent V magnitude:** 16.5 mag.\n*   This magnitude is fainter than the 16.0 mag limit for the HIRES spectrograph. Therefore, it cannot be observed by HIRES.\n\n**Star 3:**\n*   **Apparent V magnitude:** 15.5 mag.\n*   **Declination:** +48 degrees.\n*   **Magnitude Check:** At 15.5 mag, it is brighter than the 16 mag limit for HIRES and the 17 mag limit for ESPRESSO.\n*   **Declination Check:** At +48 degrees, it is visible from both Paranal in the south (north of its -70 deg limit) and Keck in the north (south of its +65 deg limit).\n*   **Conclusion:** Star 3 is observable by both instruments.\n\n**Star 4:**\n*   **Calculation of Apparent V Magnitude:** The apparent magnitude (m_V) is calculated from the absolute magnitude (M_V), distance (d), and visual extinction (A_V).\n    *   Visual Extinction (A_V) = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag.\n    *   m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + A_V\n    *   m_V = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10) - 5 + 1.24 = 15.5 + 5 - 5 + 1.24 = 16.74 mag.\n*   **Magnitude Check:** The calculated apparent magnitude of 16.74 is fainter than the 16.0 mag limit for the HIRES spectrograph.\n*   **Conclusion:** Star 4 is not observable by HIRES.\n\n**Star 5:**\n*   **Calculation of Apparent V Magnitude:**\n    *   m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5\n    *   m_V = 16.5 + 5 * log10(5) - 5 ≈ 16.5 + 5 * (0.699) - 5 ≈ 16.5 + 3.495 - 5 = 14.995 mag.\n*   **Magnitude Check:** At approximately 15.0 mag, it is brighter than the limits for both HIRES (16 mag) and ESPRESSO (17 mag).\n*   **Declination Check:** At +60 degrees, it is visible from both observatories.\n*   **Conclusion:** Star 5 is observable by both instruments.\n\nBased on this analysis, Star 3 and Star 5 are the only ones that meet both the magnitude and declination requirements for detection by ESPRESSO and HIRES.\n\n<<<B>>>"
