    "The initial calculation was correct. The google search results confirm the methodology and the results.\n- HyperPhysics and other sources describe the energetics of a two-body decay of a stationary pion.\n- They confirm that due to conservation of energy and momentum, the decay products have definite energies.\n- The kinetic energy of the muon is measured to be 4.13 MeV.\n- My calculated value was 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. The slight difference (4.13 MeV vs 4.12 MeV) could be due to slightly different rest mass values used for the pion and muon in the HyperPhysics calculation. The values given in the problem statement are m_πc² = 139.6 MeV and m_μc² = 105.7 MeV. Let's stick with my calculation based on the provided data.\n\nThe steps are:\n1.  **Conservation of Energy:** E_pion = E_muon + E_neutrino\n    m_π * c² = (KE_μ + m_μ * c²) + E_ν\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum:** p_pion = p_muon + p_neutrino\n    Since the pion is at rest, p_pion = 0.\n    Therefore, p_μ = -p_ν. The magnitudes are equal: |p_μ| = |p_ν| = p.\n3.  **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\n    For the muon: E_μ² = (p_μ*c)² + (m_μ*c²)²\n    For the neutrino (assumed massless): E_ν = p_ν*c = p*c\n4.  **Solve for Momentum (p*c):**\n    From energy conservation: E_μ = m_π*c² - E_ν = m_π*c² - p*c\n    Substitute into the energy-momentum relation for the muon:\n    (m_π*c² - p*c)² = (p*c)² + (m_μ*c²)²\n    (m_π*c²)² - 2(m_π*c²)(p*c) + (p*c)² = (p*c)² + (m_μ*c²)²\n    (m_π*c²)² - (m_μ*c²)² = 2(m_π*c²)(p*c)\n    p*c = [(m_π*c²)² - (m_μ*c²)²] / [2 * m_π*c²]\n5.  **Calculate the values:**\n    p*c = [(139.6)² - (105.7)²] / [2 * 139.6]\n    p*c = [19488.16 - 11172.49] / [279.2]\n    p*c = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.78 MeV\n6.  **Find Kinetic Energies:**\n    KE_ν = E_ν = p*c ≈ 29.8 MeV\n    KE_μ = E_μ - m_μ*c² = (m_π*c² - E_ν) - m_μ*c²\n    KE_μ = 139.6 - 29.78 - 105.7 ≈ 4.12 MeV\n\nThe results match option A.\n\nFinal Answer will be <<<A>>>.\nIn a two-body decay of a stationary particle, the energies and momenta of the product particles are uniquely determined by the conservation laws of energy and momentum.\n\nGiven the decay:\nπ⁺ → μ⁺ + ν\n\nThe rest masses are:\n*   Rest mass of π⁺ (m_π) = 139.6 MeV/c²\n*   Rest mass of μ⁺ (m_μ) = 105.7 MeV/c²\n*   The neutrino (ν) is considered massless (m_ν = 0).\n\n**1. Conservation of Energy:**\nSince the pion (π⁺) is stationary, its total initial energy is its rest energy.\nE_initial = m_πc² = 139.6 MeV\n\nThis energy is distributed among the rest mass and kinetic energies of the product particles.\nE_final = E_μ + E_ν = (m_μc² + KE_μ) + KE_ν\n\nTherefore:\n139.6 MeV = (105.7 MeV + KE_μ) + KE_ν\n\n**2. Conservation of Momentum:**\nThe initial momentum is zero because the pion is at rest. To conserve momentum, the muon (μ⁺) and the neutrino (ν) must have equal and opposite momenta.\n|p_μ| = |p_ν| = p\n\n**3. Calculation:**\nFor a massless neutrino, its energy is given by E_ν = pc. This is also its kinetic energy (KE_ν).\nSo, KE_ν = pc.\n\nFrom the conservation of energy and momentum, the momentum (pc) of the decay products can be calculated with the following formula derived from relativistic kinematics:\npc = [(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²] / [2 * m_πc²]\n\nPlugging in the given values:\npc = [(139.6)² - (105.7)²] / [2 * 139.6]\npc = [19488.16 - 11172.49] / [279.2]\npc = 8315.67 / 279.2\npc ≈ 29.8 MeV\n\nThe kinetic energy of the neutrino is therefore:\n**KE_ν** = pc ≈ **29.8 MeV**\n\nNow, we can find the total energy of the muon:\nE_μ = m_πc² - E_ν\nE_μ = 139.6 MeV - 29.8 MeV = 109.8 MeV\n\nThe kinetic energy of the muon (KE_μ) is its total energy minus its rest energy:\nKE_μ = E_μ - m_μc²\nKE_μ = 109.8 MeV - 105.7 MeV\n**KE_μ** ≈ **4.1 MeV**\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.1 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. This result is consistent with experimental observations which find the muon's kinetic energy to be around 4.13 MeV.\n\nComparing our calculated values (KE_μ ≈ 4.12 MeV, KE_ν ≈ 29.8 MeV) with the given options:\n\nA) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\nB) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nC) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nD) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
