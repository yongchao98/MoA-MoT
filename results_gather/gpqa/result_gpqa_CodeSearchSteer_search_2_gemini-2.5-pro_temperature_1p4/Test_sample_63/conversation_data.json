    "Here is a step-by-p-step derivation of the final answer.\n\n**1. Analyze the Gas Treatment Process**\n\nThe mixture of gases resulting from the heating of salts A and B is passed through a series of tubes. We can identify the components of the gas mixture by the changes in the tubes' weights.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of this tube is equal to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.015 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which absorbs acidic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂). Since the weight of this tube did not change, no acidic gases were produced in the reaction.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form solid copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass increase of the copper is due to the oxygen atoms that have bonded to it.\n    *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 0.80 g\n    *   This oxygen came from gaseous O₂.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = Mass of O₂ / Molar Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol\n    *   Given the context of decomposing nitrogen-containing salts, and its inertness to the reagents, Gas C is identified as nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\n**2. Verify Mass Conservation and Determine Reactant Composition**\n\nLet's check if the mass of the products equals the initial mass of the salt mixture.\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.025 mol * 32.00 g/mol = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of N₂ (Gas C) = 0.10 mol * 28.02 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   **Total Mass of Products** = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = **7.20 g**\n\nThis matches the initial weight of the salt mixture, confirming that our identified products (H₂O, O₂, and N₂) are correct and complete. The initial 7.20 g mixture was composed entirely of Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states we have an equimolar mixture of two salts. The products contain only N, H, and O, and no solid residue remained, suggesting the salts are likely ammonium-based. The most common salts fitting this description are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nLet's test this hypothesis. We will write a balanced chemical equation for the decomposition of an equimolar mixture of these two salts.\n\n*   Salt A: **NH₄NO₂** (Ammonium nitrite)\n*   Salt B: **NH₄NO₃** (Ammonium nitrate)\n\nThe overall reaction for a 1:1 molar mixture is:\n**NH₄NO₂ + NH₄NO₃ → Products**\n\nCombining the reactants gives the total atoms available: **N₄H₈O₅**. Now, we balance this to form our observed products: N₂, O₂, and H₂O.\n\n**N₄H₈O₅ → aN₂ + bO₂ + cH₂O**\n\n*   **Balance H:** 8 H on the left, so 8 on the right. `c = 4`. → N₄H₈O₅ → aN₂ + bO₂ + **4**H₂O\n*   **Balance O:** 5 O on the left. We have 4 O in 4H₂O. We need 1 more O. So, 2b = 1, which means `b = 0.5`. → N₄H₈O₅ → aN₂ + **0.5**O₂ + 4H₂O\n*   **Balance N:** 4 N on the left. So, 2a = 4, which means `a = 2`. → **2**N₂ + **0.5**O₂ + **4**H₂O\n\nThe balanced reaction is: **NH₄NO₂ + NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + 0.5O₂ + 4H₂O**\n\nThe molar ratio of the gaseous products is **N₂ : O₂ : H₂O = 2 : 0.5 : 4**, which simplifies to **4 : 1 : 8**.\n\nLet's compare this to the molar ratio from our experimental data:\n*   N₂ : O₂ : H₂O\n*   0.10 mol : 0.025 mol : 0.20 mol\n*   Dividing by the smallest value (0.025), we get the ratio: **4 : 1 : 8**.\n\nThe theoretical and experimental ratios match perfectly, confirming that salts A and B are indeed ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to calculate the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite - NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   1 (Nitrogen) + 4 (Hydrogen) + 1 (Nitrogen) + 2 (Oxygen) = **8 atoms**\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate - NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   1 (Nitrogen) + 4 (Hydrogen) + 1 (Nitrogen) + 3 (Oxygen) = **9 atoms**\n\n*   **Total Number of Atoms** = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 8 + 9 = **17 atoms**\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is 17.\n\n<<<A>>>"
