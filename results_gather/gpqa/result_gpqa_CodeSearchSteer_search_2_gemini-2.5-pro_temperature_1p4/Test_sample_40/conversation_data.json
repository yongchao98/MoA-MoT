    "This problem requires the application of the relativistic velocity addition formula, a key concept from Einstein's theory of special relativity.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the variables and the calculation:\n\n*   **c**: The speed of light in a vacuum. The problem states to use `c = 1`.\n*   **n**: The refractive index of the glass. The speed of light *within* the glass (in its own rest frame) is therefore `u' = c/n = 1/n`.\n*   **v**: The velocity of the glass as it moves toward the observer in the laboratory.\n*   **u**: The speed of the light in the glass as measured by the observer in the laboratory. This is the value we need to find.\n\nThe aether drag theory was an early attempt to explain this phenomenon, but it was superseded by Einstein's work. The special theory of relativity postulates that the speed of light in a vacuum is constant for all inertial observers. However, the speed of light in a medium, like glass, is not invariant and depends on the observer's frame of reference relative to the medium.\n\nTo find the speed of light as seen by the laboratory observer (`u`), we must use Einstein's velocity-addition formula. For collinear motion (where the light and the medium are moving along the same line), the formula is:\n\n`u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\nNow, we substitute the known values into this formula:\n\n1.  Replace `u'` with `1/n`.\n2.  Replace `c` with `1`.\n\nThe formula becomes:\n`u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\nSimplifying the denominator:\n`u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + v/n )`\n\nTo clear the fractions, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n`u = n * ( (1/n) + v ) / n * ( 1 + v/n )`\n`u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\nThis result matches the expression given in option B. This formula correctly describes the phenomenon first observed in the Fizeau experiment, where a moving medium \"drags\" the light along with it.\n\n<<<B>>>"
