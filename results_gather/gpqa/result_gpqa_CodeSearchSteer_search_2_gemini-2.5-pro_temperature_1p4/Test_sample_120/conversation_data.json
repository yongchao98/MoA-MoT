    "The analysis of the reaction between (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane and lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi) is based on well-established principles of organocuprate chemistry.\n\n1.  **Reagent and Reaction Type**: The reagent is lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi), a Gilman reagent, which is a source of a nucleophilic methyl group. Gilman reagents are known to react with epoxides in a ring-opening reaction that forms a new carbon-carbon bond. This reaction is mechanistically similar to an Sₙ2 reaction.\n\n2.  **Regioselectivity**: The prompt and chemical literature confirm that organocuprates attack the less sterically hindered carbon of an unsymmetrical epoxide. In the given bicyclic epoxide, the epoxide ring is formed between carbons C1 and C6. C1 bears a methyl group, making it a more substituted and sterically hindered position. C6, while part of the bicyclic system, does not have an additional alkyl substituent. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack C6.\n\n3.  **Stereoselectivity**: The reaction proceeds via an Sₙ2-type mechanism, where the nucleophile attacks the carbon from the side opposite to the carbon-oxygen bond. This backside attack results in an inversion of the configuration at the carbon being attacked.\n    *   The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n    *   The attack occurs at C6, which has an (S) configuration. The inversion of configuration will change it to (R).\n    *   The configuration at C1, which is (R), is not attacked and remains unchanged. This carbon will bear the resulting hydroxyl group.\n    *   The configurations of the other stereocenters, C3 (R) and C4 (R), are also unaffected by the reaction.\n\n4.  **Product Structure and Nomenclature**:\n    *   The attack on C6 opens the epoxide ring, and after workup (which is implied), an alcohol is formed at C1.\n    *   The original cyclohexane ring now has four methyl groups and one hydroxyl group.\n    *   According to IUPAC nomenclature, the carbon with the hydroxyl group is designated C1. Thus, the original C1 remains C1 in the product.\n    *   The carbon that was attacked (C6) is adjacent to the new C1, so it becomes C2. The other carbons are numbered around the ring. The original C4 becomes the new C4, and the original C3 becomes the new C5.\n    *   The final product is a 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. This eliminates options A and C.\n\n5.  **Final Stereochemistry**:\n    *   **C1**: Retains its original (R) configuration. The product is (1R, ...).\n    *   **C2 (from C6)**: Undergoes inversion from (S) to (R). The product is (..., 2R, ...).\n    *   **C4 (from C4)**: Retains its original (R) configuration. The product is (..., 4R, ...).\n    *   **C5 (from C3)**: Retains its original (R) configuration. The product is (..., 5R).\n\nCombining these determines the final product's stereochemistry as (1R, 2R, 4R, 5R). This corresponds to option D.\n\nTherefore, the reaction of (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane with Me₂CuLi yields (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n<<<D>>>"
