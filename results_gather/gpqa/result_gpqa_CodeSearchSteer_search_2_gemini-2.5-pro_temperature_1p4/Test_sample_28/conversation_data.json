    "To eliminate an anti-nutritional compound synthesized by a specific gene, the most effective strategy is to create a mutation that results in a complete loss of function of the protein encoded by that gene. This is most reliably achieved by introducing a mutation that stops protein production prematurely. Let's analyze the effects of the mutations in each mutant.\n\nThe intact gene sequence begins:\n`5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT...-3’`\nThis translates to the amino acid sequence:\nMet - Phe - Leu - Ala...\n\nNow let's examine the mutants:\n*   **Mutant 1:** The sequence is `5’-ATG TTC TAC...-3’`. This changes the third codon from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, which substitutes one amino acid for another. While this could potentially affect the protein's function, it is not guaranteed to eliminate it completely. The protein might still be partially functional.\n*   **Mutant 2:** The sequence is `5’-ATG TTC TAA...-3’`. This changes the third codon from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **nonsense codon**, also known as a stop codon. This mutation will cause the ribosome to terminate protein synthesis at this point, resulting in a drastically shortened, truncated protein containing only two amino acids (Met-Phe). A protein this short is almost certain to be non-functional.\n*   **Mutant 3:** This sequence contains multiple changes compared to the original, resulting in several amino acid substitutions (missense mutations). Similar to Mutant 1, while multiple changes make a loss of function more likely than a single change, it still produces a full-length protein that might retain some activity.\n*   **Mutant 4:** This sequence appears to have both a substitution (`CTC` to `TAC`) and a deletion of the `GGT` codon. A deletion of three bases removes one amino acid but keeps the rest of the reading frame intact. This, combined with the missense mutation, alters the protein but doesn't guarantee a complete loss of function.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth nonsense and frameshift mutations are the most likely to cause a complete loss of protein function. A nonsense mutation, like the one in Mutant 2, introduces a premature stop codon, leading to a severely truncated and likely non-functional protein. Since this mutation occurs very early in the gene (at the third codon), it is the most probable one among the choices to completely eliminate the function of the enzyme, thereby getting rid of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<D>>>"
