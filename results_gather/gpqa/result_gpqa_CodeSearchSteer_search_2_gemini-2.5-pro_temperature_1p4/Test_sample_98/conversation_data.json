    "To identify the unknown compound, a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data is necessary.\n\n### 1. Analysis of FTIR Data\n\n*   **Broad Absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a hallmark feature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. The broadness is due to the formation of dimers.\n*   **Strong Absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, which is also characteristic of a carboxylic acid. The position around 1700 cm⁻¹ is typical for a saturated, dimeric carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The data strongly indicate that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four possible options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group present but does not differentiate between the isomers.\n\n### 2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data\n\nThe ¹H NMR spectrum provides detailed information about the carbon-hydrogen framework of the molecule. The key to solving this problem lies in deciphering the complex splitting patterns reported.\n\n*   **No Vinyl-Hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of protons attached to carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C-H), which is consistent with all four structures being saturated alkanoic acids.\n*   **Complex Splitting:** When a proton is coupled to multiple, non-equivalent sets of neighboring protons, its signal is split sequentially by each set. The resulting pattern is named based on these successive splittings (e.g., doublet of triplets).\n    *   **Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This pattern arises when a single proton has three sets of non-equivalent neighbors on adjacent carbons: one neighboring proton (giving the doublet), a group of two equivalent protons (giving the triplet), and a group of three equivalent protons (giving the quartet).\n    *   **Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This pattern arises when a single proton has three sets of non-equivalent neighbors on adjacent carbons: one neighboring proton (giving the doublet), a group of two equivalent protons (giving the first triplet), and another distinct group of two equivalent protons (giving the second triplet).\n\n### 3. Structural Evaluation\n\nLet's analyze the structure that would produce both of the described splitting patterns.\n\n*   **Structure C: `CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH`**\n\n    Let's first interpret this condensed formula. Assuming the atoms are listed sequentially, the structure is `CH3-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-CH2-COOH`. The longest carbon chain containing the `COOH` group determines the parent name. This results in the IUPAC name **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**.\n\n    Let's number the carbon chain starting from the carboxyl carbon as C1:\n    `CH3(5)-CH(4)(CH2CH3)-CH(3)(CH2CH3)-CH2(2)-COOH(1)`\n\n    Now, let's analyze the splitting for the key protons on the chiral centers (C3 and C4):\n\n    1.  **Proton on C4 (H4):** This proton is on a carbon adjacent to C3, C5, and the CH₂ of its ethyl group.\n        *   It is coupled to **H3** (1 proton), which splits its signal into a **doublet (d)**.\n        *   It is coupled to the **CH₃ group at C5** (3 protons), which splits its signal into a **quartet (q)**.\n        *   It is coupled to the **CH₂ of the ethyl group on C4** (2 protons), which splits its signal into a **triplet (t)**.\n        *   The resulting pattern for H4 is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This perfectly matches the first signal described.\n\n    2.  **Proton on C3 (H3):** This proton is on a carbon adjacent to C2, C4, and the CH₂ of its own ethyl group.\n        *   It is coupled to **H4** (1 proton), which splits its signal into a **doublet (d)**.\n        *   It is coupled to the **CH₂ group at C2** (2 protons), which splits its signal into a **triplet (t)**.\n        *   It is coupled to the **CH₂ of the ethyl group on C3** (2 protons), which splits its signal into another **triplet (t)**.\n        *   The resulting pattern for H3 is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This perfectly matches the second signal described.\n\nSince the structure corresponding to 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid exhibits both of the complex splitting patterns observed in the ¹H NMR spectrum, it is the correct compound. The formula provided in option C, interpreted as `CH3-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-CH2-COOH`, correctly represents this molecule. A similar analysis of options A, B, and D does not yield both of these specific complex splitting patterns.\n\n<<<C>>>"
