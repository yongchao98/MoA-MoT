    "The search results confirm the feasibility of the proposed reaction sequence. Specifically, the reaction of ethyl cyanoacetate with alkyl halides in the presence of a base is a standard alkylation procedure. The reaction with a dihalide like 1,5-dibromopentane is known to lead to cyclization, forming cyclic products. The final product, Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate, is a known chemical compound.\n\nMy step-by-step analysis of the reaction and the structure of the final product is therefore correct.\n\n**Reaction Pathway:**\n\n1.  **Product 1 (Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky):** Acetic acid reacts with Br2/Pyridine/Acetic anhydride to form bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH).\n2.  **Product 2 (Fischer Esterification):** Bromoacetic acid reacts with ethanol and sulfuric acid to form ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3).\n3.  **Product 3 (Nucleophilic Substitution):** Ethyl bromoacetate reacts with sodium cyanide to form ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3).\n4.  **Product 4 (Intramolecular Dialkylation):** Ethyl cyanoacetate is deprotonated by excess sodium hydride. The resulting anion undergoes a two-step reaction with 1,5-dibromopentane: an initial intermolecular substitution followed by an intramolecular cyclization to form ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Final Product 4 (Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate):**\n\nThe structure of product 4 is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano (-CN) group and an ethyl carboxylate (-COOCH2CH3) group attached to the same carbon atom.\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must look at the molecule's symmetry. At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-flipping. This creates a plane of symmetry that passes through carbon-1 (the one with the substituents) and the opposite carbon, carbon-4.\n\nBecause of this symmetry:\n\n*   The four protons on the carbons adjacent to the substituted carbon (C2 and C6) are chemically equivalent and will produce one signal.\n*   The four protons on the next set of carbons (C3 and C5) are chemically equivalent and will produce a second signal.\n*   The two protons on the carbon opposite the substituted carbon (C4) are chemically equivalent, producing a third signal.\n*   The two protons of the methylene group (-O-CH2-CH3) in the ethyl ester are chemically distinct from all others and will produce a fourth signal.\n*   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH3) in the ethyl ester are also chemically distinct, giving a fifth signal.\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 5 chemically distinct hydrogen environments in the molecule.\n\n<<<D>>>"
