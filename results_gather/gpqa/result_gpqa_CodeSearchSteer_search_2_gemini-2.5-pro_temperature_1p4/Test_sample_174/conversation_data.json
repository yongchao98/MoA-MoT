    "An oscillating spheroidal charge distribution can be approximated as an oscillating electric dipole, especially in the radiation zone. The radiated power from such a dipole is not uniform in all directions and also depends on the wavelength of the radiation.\n\n### Angular Dependence of Radiated Power\n\nFor an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) is given by the Larmor formula, which shows a characteristic angular distribution. The power is proportional to `sin²(θ)`, where `θ` is the angle measured from the axis of oscillation (the z-axis).\n\nThe formula is:\n`dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)`\n\nThe maximum power, A, is radiated at an angle where `sin²(θ)` is maximum. This occurs at `θ = 90°` (the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis), where `sin²(90°) = 1`.\n\nTo find the fraction of the maximum power radiated at `θ = 30°`, we calculate `sin²(30°)`:\n`sin(30°) = 1/2`\n`sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`\n\nTherefore, the power radiated at 30° is A/4, which means the fraction is 1/4.\n\n### Wavelength Dependence\n\nThe total power radiated by an oscillating dipole is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency (ω⁴). The relationship between angular frequency `ω` and wavelength `λ` is `ω = 2πc/λ`.\n\nTherefore, the radiated power `P` is proportional to `(1/λ)⁴` or `λ⁻⁴`. This inverse fourth power dependence on wavelength is a key feature of electric dipole radiation, also known as Rayleigh scattering. The function `f` describing the radiated power will have a `λ⁻⁴` dependence.\n\nCombining these two findings:\n*   The fraction of maximum power A at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n*   The possible form of the function `f` has a wavelength dependence of **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
