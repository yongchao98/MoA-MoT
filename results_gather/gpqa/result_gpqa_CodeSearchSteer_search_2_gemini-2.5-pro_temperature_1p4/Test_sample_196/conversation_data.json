    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product:\n\n**1. Identification of Compound X from IR and NMR Data**\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The broad absorption in the range of **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the O-H bond in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding.\n    *   The strong peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** is indicative of a C=O (carbonyl) group, specifically from a carboxylic acid.\n    *   Absorptions at **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹** suggest the presence of C=C bonds within an aromatic ring.\n    *   From the IR data, we can deduce that Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This broad singlet in the downfield region is a classic signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** The two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, indicate a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring. The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the signal at 7.2 ppm corresponds to the protons adjacent to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n    *   **Alkyl Group Signals:**\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for three protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for two protons is likely a methylene group (-CH₂-) situated between a methyl and a methine group.\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for three protons suggests a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a single proton (a methine group, -CH-).\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for one proton corresponds to a methine group (-CH-) that is bonded to the aromatic ring and is also adjacent to both a methyl and a methylene group.\n    *   **Assembling the Structure:** Putting the pieces together, the alkyl group is a *sec*-butyl group [-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃], which is attached to the benzene ring. Combining this with the *para*-substituted carboxylic acid information, **Compound X is identified as 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n**2. Reaction with Red Phosphorus and Hydroiodic Acid (HI)**\n\n*   The reaction of a carboxylic acid with red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI) is a powerful reduction method.\n*   This combination of reagents completely reduces the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). The rest of the molecule, in this case, the stable *sec*-butyl group and the benzene ring, remains unchanged.\n\n**3. Identification of the Final Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material (Compound X):** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of the -COOH group to a -CH₃ group.\n*   **Final Product:** The resulting molecule is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n*   A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect structure.\n*   B) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material, Compound X.\n*   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect isomer of the butyl group.\n*   D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This matches our deduced final product.\n\n<<<D>>>"
