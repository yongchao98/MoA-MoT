    "The problem provides the relationship between the number of stars and their parallax and asks for the relationship between the number of stars per unit distance and their distance.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Given Information:** The number of stars, let's call the number density per unit parallax `N(plx)`, varies with parallax (plx) as `1/plx^5`. In mathematical terms, this can be written as the number of stars in a small parallax interval `d(plx)`, which is `dN`, is proportional to `1/plx^5 d(plx)`.\n    So, `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`.\n\n2.  **Fundamental Relationship:** The distance to a star (`r`) is inversely proportional to its parallax (`plx`). The relationship is given by:\n    `r = 1/plx`\n\n3.  **Objective:** We need to find how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance. This is the quantity `dN/dr`.\n\n4.  **Mathematical Transformation:** To convert the variable from parallax (`plx`) to distance (`r`), we use the chain rule of differentiation:\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the derivative:** We need to find the derivative of parallax with respect to distance, `d(plx)/dr`. Since `plx = 1/r`:\n    `d(plx)/dr = d(1/r)/dr = -1/r^2`\n\n6.  **Substitute and Solve:** Now, we substitute the known relations into the chain rule equation:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (1/plx^5) * (-1/r^2)`\n\n    To express the entire relationship in terms of `r`, we replace `plx` with `1/r`:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (1/(1/r)^5) * (-1/r^2)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ (r^5) * (-1/r^2)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ -r^3`\n\nThe negative sign indicates that for a fixed parallax interval, the corresponding distance interval grows, but the number of stars decreases. The magnitude of how the number of stars per unit distance changes is proportional to the cube of the distance.\n\nTherefore, the number of stars in that region of the sky changes with distance (per unit range of distance, r) as `~ r^3`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
