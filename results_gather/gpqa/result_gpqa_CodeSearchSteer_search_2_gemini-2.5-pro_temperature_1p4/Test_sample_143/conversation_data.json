    "Here is the step-by-step derivation of the mean decay distance.\n\n1.  **Calculate the proper lifetime (τ) of the meson.**\n    The proper lifetime τ is related to the decay width Γ by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n    *   τ = ħ / Γ\n    *   ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻²² MeV·s\n    *   Γ = 320 MeV\n    *   τ = (6.582 x 10⁻²² MeV·s) / (320 MeV) ≈ 2.057 x 10⁻²⁴ s\n\n2.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ) and the velocity factor (β).**\n    The Lorentz factor γ is the ratio of the particle's energy to its mass.\n    *   γ = E_X / m_X = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 80 / 12 = 20/3 ≈ 6.667\n    The velocity factor β = v/c is related to γ.\n    *   β = sqrt(1 - 1/γ²) = sqrt(1 - 1/(20/3)²) = sqrt(1 - 9/400) = sqrt(391/400) ≈ 0.9887\n\n3.  **Calculate the mean decay distance (L).**\n    The mean decay distance in the laboratory frame is the distance the particle travels at its velocity (v = βc) during its dilated lifetime (γτ).\n    *   L = v * γ * τ = (βc) * γ * τ\n    *   L ≈ 0.9887 * (3 x 10⁸ m/s) * (20/3) * (2.057 x 10⁻²⁴ s)\n    *   L ≈ 4.0655 x 10⁻¹⁵ m\n\n**Alternative Calculation using ħc**\n\nA more direct way to calculate the decay distance is using the formula L = (p/m) * (ħc/Γ), where p is the momentum and ħc is a physical constant.\n\n1.  **Calculate the momentum (p).**\n    *   p = sqrt(E_X² - m_X²) = sqrt((8 GeV)² - (1.2 GeV)²) = sqrt(64 - 1.44) GeV/c = sqrt(62.56) GeV/c ≈ 7.9095 GeV/c.\n\n2.  **Calculate the decay length (L).**\n    *   The constant ħc ≈ 197.3 MeV·fm (or 197.3 x 10⁻¹⁵ MeV·m).\n    *   L = (p/m_X) * (ħc/Γ)\n    *   L = (7.9095 GeV/c / 1.2 GeV/c²) * (197.3 MeV·fm / 320 MeV)\n    *   L ≈ 6.591 * (0.6166 fm)\n    *   L ≈ 4.065 fm\n    *   Since 1 fm = 10⁻¹⁵ m, L ≈ 4.065 x 10⁻¹⁵ m.\n\nBoth calculation methods yield the same result, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
