    "When the number of sides N of a regular polygon becomes infinitely large, the polygon approaches a circle. In this case, the apothem 'a' becomes the radius of the circle. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern for a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\nThe intensity of the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture is described by a function involving Bessel functions. The angular positions of the intensity minima (the dark rings) are determined by the zeros of the Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x).\n\nThe condition for the m-th minimum is given by:\n`sin(θ_m) = (z_m / (2πa)) * λ`\n\nWhere:\n*   `θ_m` is the angular position of the m-th minimum.\n*   `λ` is the wavelength of the light.\n*   `a` is the radius of the aperture.\n*   `z_m` is the m-th zero of the Bessel function J₁(x).\n\nUsing the small-angle approximation (sin(θ) ≈ θ), the formula becomes:\n`θ_m = (z_m / (2π)) * (λ/a)`\n\nTo find the angular distance between the first two minima, we need to calculate `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n\n1.  **Angular position of the first minimum (θ₁):**\n    This corresponds to the first zero of J₁(x), which is `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`.\n    `θ₁ = (3.8317 / (2π)) * (λ/a) ≈ 0.6098 * (λ/a)`\n\n2.  **Angular position of the second minimum (θ₂):**\n    This corresponds to the second zero of J₁(x), which is `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`.\n    `θ₂ = (7.0156 / (2π)) * (λ/a) ≈ 1.1166 * (λ/a)`\n\n3.  **Angular distance between the first two minima (Δθ):**\n    `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = (1.1166 * λ/a) - (0.6098 * λ/a)`\n    `Δθ = 0.5068 * (λ/a)`\n\nThis value is approximately `0.506 λ/a`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
