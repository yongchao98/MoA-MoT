    "To determine the numerical value of \"a,\" we must use the normalization condition for the wave function, a fundamental principle in quantum mechanics. This condition states that the total probability of finding the particle somewhere in the space where it can exist is equal to 1. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n\n∫ |ψ(x)|² dx = 1\n\nThe integral is taken over the entire region where the particle can be found. The problem specifies that particles were only found between x=1 and x=3. Therefore, the integral for normalization should be evaluated from 1 to 3.\n\nThe given wave function is ψ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i.\n\nFirst, we need to find the square of the modulus of the wave function, |ψ(x)|². For a complex function of the form R + iI (where R is the real part and I is the imaginary part), the squared modulus is R² + I².\n\nIn this case:\n*   The real part (R) is `a / sqrt(1 + x)`\n*   The imaginary part (I) is `-0.5`\n\nSo, |ψ(x)|² is:\n|ψ(x)|² = (a / sqrt(1 + x))² + (-0.5)²\n|ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\nNow, we set up the normalization integral from x=1 to x=3:\n∫ [from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1\n\nWe can solve this integral by separating it into two parts:\n∫ [from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x)) dx + ∫ [from 1 to 3] 0.25 dx = 1\n\nThe first part of the integral is:\n∫ (a² / (1 + x)) dx = a² * ∫ (1 / (1 + x)) dx = a² * ln|1 + x|\n\nThe second part is:\n∫ 0.25 dx = 0.25 * x\n\nNow, we evaluate the definite integral from 1 to 3:\n[a² * ln(1 + x) + 0.25 * x] (from 1 to 3) = 1\n(a² * ln(1 + 3) + 0.25 * 3) - (a² * ln(1 + 1) + 0.25 * 1) = 1\n(a² * ln(4) + 0.75) - (a² * ln(2) + 0.25) = 1\na² * ln(4) - a² * ln(2) + 0.75 - 0.25 = 1\na² * (ln(4) - ln(2)) + 0.5 = 1\n\nUsing the logarithmic property ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B):\na² * ln(4/2) + 0.5 = 1\na² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\n\nNow, we solve for 'a':\na² * ln(2) = 0.5\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n\nThe value of ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.\na² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931\na² ≈ 0.7214\n\na ≈ sqrt(0.7214)\na ≈ 0.849\n\nThis value is closest to 0.85.\n\n<<<D>>>"
