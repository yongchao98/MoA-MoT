    "The \"impulse\" approximation in many-body nuclear calculations is a simplifying assumption that allows the complex interaction between a probe (like a lepton in an electroweak interaction) and a nucleus to be treated as a collection of interactions with individual nucleons. This approximation hinges on several key ideas about the nature of the interaction and the nucleus.\n\nBased on the principles of nuclear physics, the assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are:\n\n1.  **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.** This is the foundational concept of the impulse approximation. The interaction with the nucleus is treated as an incoherent sum of interactions with single nucleons, while the other (A-1) nucleons are considered \"spectators\". This is often referred to as the \"one-body\" current assumption.\n\n2.  **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.** This assumption means that the incoming probe interacts with only one nucleon, and the outgoing particles (the scattered probe and the struck nucleon) do not have any further interactions with the remaining spectator nucleons. Corrections to the impulse approximation often involve accounting for these \"final state interactions\" (FSI), which demonstrates that their absence is a core assumption of the basic approximation.\n\n4.  **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.** The term \"impulse\" implies the interaction occurs over a very short time scale. This timescale is assumed to be so brief that the forces binding the nucleon within the nucleus do not have time to act during the collision. Therefore, the nucleon can be treated as a free particle at the moment of interaction.\n\nThe third statement, regarding the non-relativistic nature of quarks within the nucleon, is not a direct assumption of the impulse approximation itself. The impulse approximation simplifies the nuclear-level problem by treating nucleons as the fundamental entities. The internal structure of the nucleon (its quark and gluon constituents) is typically handled separately through the use of nucleon form factors, which parameterize the nucleon's response, but this is not one of the foundational assumptions for treating the *nucleus* as a collection of nucleons.\n\nTherefore, the three assumptions that jointly define the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
