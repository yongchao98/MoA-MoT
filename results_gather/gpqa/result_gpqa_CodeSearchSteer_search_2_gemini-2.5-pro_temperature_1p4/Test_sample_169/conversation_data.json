    "Here is a step-by-by-step derivation of the result.\n\nThe expectation value `<A>` of an observable A for a quantum state `|ψ⟩` is calculated using the formula: `<A> = <ψ|A|ψ> / <ψ|ψ>`.\n\nIn this problem, the observable is the spin along the y-direction, `S_y`, and the spin state is given by the ket `|χ⟩`.\n\nThe spin operator `S_y` is related to the Pauli matrix `σ_y` by `S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y`.\n\nThe given spin state is `|χ⟩ = (3i, 4)`, which can be written as a column vector:\n```\n|χ⟩ =  [3i]\n        [4 ]\n```\n\n**Step 1: Normalize the spin state**\nFirst, we need to find the inner product `<χ|χ>`. The bra `<χ|` is the conjugate transpose of the ket `|χ⟩`.\n*   Ket: `|χ⟩ = [3i, 4]`\n*   Bra: `<χ| = [-3i, 4]` (the complex conjugate of `3i` is `-3i`)\n\nNow, calculate the inner product:\n`<χ|χ> = [-3i, 4] * [3i, 4]`\n`<χ|χ> = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4) = -9(i²) + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25`\nThe state is not normalized because the inner product is not 1.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate `S_y|χ>`**\nThe operator for the spin in the y-direction is:\n`S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n\nNow, apply this operator to the ket `|χ⟩`:\n`S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] * [3i, 4]`\n`S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * [(0)(3i) + (-i)(4), (i)(3i) + (0)(4)]`\n`S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * [-4i, 3i²]`\n`S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * [-4i, -3]`\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the full expression `<χ|S_y|χ>`**\nNow we multiply the result from Step 2 by the bra `<χ|`:\n`<χ|S_y|χ> = [-3i, 4] * ( (ħ/2) * [-4i, -3] )`\n`<χ|S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * [ (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3) ]`\n`<χ|S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * [ 12i² - 12 ]`\n`<χ|S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * [ -12 - 12 ]`\n`<χ|S_y|χ> = (ħ/2) * [-24] = -12ħ`\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the expectation value `<S_y>`**\nFinally, we divide the result from Step 3 by the normalization factor from Step 1.\n`<S_y> = <χ|S_y|χ> / <χ|χ>`\n`<S_y> = -12ħ / 25`\n\nThis can be written as `-12*hbar/25`. Comparing this to the options provided:\nA) -25*hbar/2\nB) -12*hbar/25\nC) 25*hbar/2\nD) 12*hbar/25\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
