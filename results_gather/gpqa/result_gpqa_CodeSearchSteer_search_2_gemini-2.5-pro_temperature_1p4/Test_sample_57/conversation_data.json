    "To determine which of the listed physical theories does not require regularization at high energies, we must examine the fundamental structure of each theory concerning ultraviolet (UV) divergences.\n\n*   **Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)** and **Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)** are both quantum field theories (QFTs) that describe fundamental forces. A characteristic feature of calculations in these theories, particularly those involving loop diagrams, is the emergence of infinities at high energies (ultraviolet divergences). To extract meaningful, finite physical predictions, a procedure called regularization is necessary. This involves introducing a parameter, known as a regulator or cutoff, to manage the infinities. Different schemes, such as lattice regularization for QCD or dimensional regularization for QED, are employed to make the theories mathematically tractable. Therefore, both QED and QCD definitively require regularization.\n\n*   **Classical Electrodynamics**, while not a quantum field theory, has its own high-energy problem. The theory describes the interaction of charges and electromagnetic fields. If one considers a charged particle to be a point, its self-energy—the energy of the field created by the particle itself—becomes infinite. This issue at very small scales is a classical precursor to the divergence problems in QFT. To avoid this infinity, one must introduce a form of regularization, such as assuming the particle has a finite size instead of being a point. Thus, Classical Electrodynamics is not free from the need for regularization at short distances/high energies.\n\n*   **Superstring Theory** is fundamentally different from point-particle theories. It proposes that the basic constituents of reality are not point-like particles but one-dimensional extended objects called strings. Interactions, which in QFT occur at a single point in spacetime, are \"smeared out\" in string theory as strings join and split. This extension in space prevents the infinities that plague QFTs at short distances. Superstring theory is widely considered to be a UV-finite theory, meaning it is free from ultraviolet divergences and does not require regularization at high energies. The finite size of the string naturally acts as a UV cutoff.\n\nBased on this analysis, Superstring Theory is the one theory listed that is formulated to be finite at high energies without the need for an external regularization procedure.\n\n<<<A>>>"
