    "To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star 1 is greater than that of Star 2, we can use the principles of black-body radiation.\n\n### Key Principles:\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** This law states that the total energy radiated per unit surface area of a black body is directly proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature (T). The total luminosity (L) of a spherical star is given by the formula L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n2.  **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates the temperature of a black body to the wavelength (λ_max) at which it emits the most light. The law states that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature (λ_max ∝ 1/T). This means that if two stars have the same peak emission wavelength, they must have the same surface temperature.\n\n### Applying the Principles:\nThe problem provides the following information:\n*   The radius of Star 1 is 1.5 times that of Star 2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂).\n*   The wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same (λ_max,₁ = λ_max,₂).\n\nFrom Wien's Displacement Law, since the peak wavelengths are identical, the surface temperatures of the two stars must also be the same (T₁ = T₂).\n\nNow, we can find the ratio of their luminosities (L₁/L₂) using the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n\nThe constants 4, π, and σ cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁²/R₂²) * (T₁⁴/T₂⁴)\n\nSince we established that T₁ = T₂, the temperature term (T₁⁴/T₂⁴) becomes 1. The equation further simplifies to:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = R₁² / R₂² = (R₁/R₂)²\n\nGiven that R₁/R₂ = 1.5, we can calculate the luminosity ratio:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² = 2.25\n\n### Extraneous Information:\nThe information about the stars' masses and their radial velocities is not needed for this calculation. Luminosity is an intrinsic property of a star, determined by its radius and temperature. Radial velocity describes a star's motion toward or away from an observer and is related to the Doppler effect, but it does not affect the star's total energy output or luminosity.\n\nTherefore, the luminosity of Star 1 is greater than the luminosity of Star 2 by a factor of 2.25.\n\n<<<D>>>"
