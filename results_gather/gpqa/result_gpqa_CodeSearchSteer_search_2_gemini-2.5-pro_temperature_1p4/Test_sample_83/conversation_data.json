    "When solving higher-dimensional heat equations, the semi-discretization in space leads to a large system of ordinary differential equations. The solution involves computing the matrix exponential. For parallel processing, the rational approximation of this matrix exponential function is key.\n\nThe crucial step that allows for the conversion of a sequential algorithm into a parallel one is the decomposition of this fractional (or rational) approximation into a sum of simpler terms using a partial fraction expansion. This decomposition breaks the single complex problem into multiple, independent systems of linear equations. Each of these systems can then be solved simultaneously on a separate processor. The final solution is obtained by summing the results from each processor.\n\nTherefore, the key enabling factor is the ability to express the fractional approximation in a partial fraction form.\n\n*   **A) Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions:** This typically complicates, rather than enables, parallelization as it can introduce more data dependencies.\n*   **C) Stability analysis:** While essential for any valid numerical method, stability analysis verifies the reliability of an algorithm, it is not the mechanism that enables parallelization.\n*   **D) Complex roots of fractional approximation:** The nature of the roots (whether real or complex) is a property of the specific fractional approximation used. While it affects the calculations within the partial fractions, it is the decomposition itself that is fundamental to the parallelization strategy.\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
