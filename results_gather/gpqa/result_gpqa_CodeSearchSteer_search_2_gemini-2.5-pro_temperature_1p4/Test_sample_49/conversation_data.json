    "To determine the number of loops in the Feynman diagram, one must examine the structure of the provided mathematical expression. In quantum field theory calculations, the number of loops in a diagram is directly related to the power of the `1/(4π)` factors that appear after integrating over the loop momenta.\n\nThe key term in the note is `1/(4pi)^6`.\n\nIn a calculation using dimensional regularization in a four-dimensional spacetime, each loop integral contributes a factor of `1/(4π)^2` to the final expression. Therefore, for a diagram with *L* loops, the expression will contain a factor of `(1/(4π)^2)^L`, which simplifies to `1/(4π)^(2L)`.\n\nGiven the term `1/(4pi)^6` in your colleague's notes, we can set up the equation:\n\n`2L = 6`\n\nSolving for *L* gives:\n\n`L = 3`\n\nThe other factors in the expression provide additional context but do not as directly indicate the number of loops:\n*   `alpha^3` and `g^2`: These are coupling constants. Their powers relate to the number of vertices in the diagram, indicating a relatively complex interaction.\n*   `(Q/M)^2`: This ratio of energy scales is a typical result of evaluating the loop integrals, but its specific power does not uniquely determine the loop number.\n\nBased on the factor of `1/(4pi)^6`, the Feynman diagram must have contained three loops.\n\n<<<B>>>"
