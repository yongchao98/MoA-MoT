    "The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model Lagrangian. These operators must be consistent with the fundamental symmetries of the underlying framework.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the symmetries in question:\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry:** SMEFT is a relativistic quantum field theory, and as such, it is built upon the principle of Lorentz invariance. The operators in the SMEFT Lagrangian are constructed to be scalars under Lorentz transformations.\n\n2.  **Poincaré Symmetry:** Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry (rotations and boosts) as well as spacetime translations. It is a fundamental symmetry of spacetime that is respected by the Standard Model and, by construction, also by SMEFT.\n\n3.  **CP Symmetry:** CP (Charge-Parity) symmetry is known to be violated in the Standard Model itself, specifically in the weak interactions described by the CKM matrix. SMEFT allows for and parameterizes additional sources of CP violation through higher-dimensional operators. Therefore, operators in SMEFT are not required to respect CP symmetry.\n\n4.  **CPT Symmetry:** The CPT theorem is a fundamental principle of quantum field theory which states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian is invariant under the combined transformation of Charge conjugation (C), Parity inversion (P), and Time reversal (T). Since SMEFT is formulated within this framework, its operators must respect CPT symmetry. Violation of CPT would imply a violation of Lorentz invariance.\n\nBased on this, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, and CPT symmetry.\n\n<<<C>>>"
