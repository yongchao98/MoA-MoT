    "To determine which protein complex will be least observed in an assay for active chromatin in a shmoo, it is essential to understand the cellular state. When *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* forms a shmoo in response to a pheromone (or a peptide that mimics it), it undergoes cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase. This state is characterized by high levels of transcription of mating-related genes but a halt before DNA replication (S-phase). The experiment aims to recover the proteome of *active* chromatin, which is the site of this intense gene transcription.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the expected abundance of each complex:\n\n*   **A) Pre-initiation complex (PIC):** The PIC is a large assembly of proteins, including RNA polymerase II and general transcription factors, that is required to start transcription. Since shmoo formation involves the high expression of specific genes, these complexes would be abundant at the promoters of those active genes and thus readily recovered in the assay.\n\n*   **C) Nucleosome histone complex:** Nucleosomes are the basic unit of chromatin, consisting of DNA wrapped around histone proteins. All chromatin, whether active or inactive, is composed of nucleosomes. In active regions, the histones are often modified, but they are fundamentally present. Therefore, histone proteins will be one of the most abundant components recovered.\n\n*   **D) Enhancer protein complex:** Enhancers are DNA sequences that bind activator proteins (transcription factors) to significantly boost the transcription of target genes. This is a key mechanism for upregulating the mating-specific genes required for shmoo formation. As such, these complexes are a hallmark of active chromatin and would be abundant.\n\n*   **B) Pre-replication complex (pre-RC):** The pre-RC assembles on origins of replication during the G1 phase to \"license\" the DNA for replication in the upcoming S-phase. However, a yeast cell forming a shmoo is arrested in G1 and is not preparing to divide; its metabolic and synthetic activity is directed towards mating, not DNA replication. While the pre-RCs are assembled during G1, they are not part of the active *transcriptional* machinery that is the focus of the experiment. The cell actively prevents entry into S-phase, making complexes associated with replication functionally separate from the highly active transcription process. Therefore, compared to the complexes directly involved in transcription (A and D) and the fundamental structural components of chromatin (C), the pre-replication complex would be the least observed in a proteomic analysis of *active chromatin*.\n\n<<<B>>>"
