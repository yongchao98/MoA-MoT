    "### Analysis of Compounds\n\nTo solve the question, we need to analyze the properties of each pair of compounds.\n\n#### Part A: Tautomerism\n\nTautomerism is a chemical equilibrium between two readily interconvertible structural isomers. For keto-enol tautomerism, the key requirement is the presence of an alpha-hydrogenâ€”a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n\n*   **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** The structure consists of a six-membered ring with two C=C double bonds and two C=O double bonds. The carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the ring's double bonds and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached. Because it lacks alpha-hydrogens, benzoquinone does not exhibit keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha to the carbonyl carbons and each has hydrogen atoms. These alpha-hydrogens can migrate, allowing the compound to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), is particularly stable due to aromaticity, meaning the equilibrium strongly favors this enol form. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism.\n\n**Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n#### Part B: Optical Isomerism\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. The most common feature leading to chirality is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups, known as a chiral center.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (Methyl lactate):** The central carbon atom (C2) is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    1.  a hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  a hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  a methyl group (-CH3)\n    4.  an ester group (-COOCH3)\n    Since it has a carbon atom attached to four different groups, it is a chiral center. Consequently, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exists as a pair of enantiomers (optical isomers) and is optically active.\n\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the trans-isomer of an alkene. It has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C=C double bond. Molecules with a plane of symmetry are achiral and thus do not exhibit optical isomerism. While it has a geometric isomer (dimethyl maleate), it does not have optical isomers.\n\n**Conclusion for B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nCombining the conclusions:\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
