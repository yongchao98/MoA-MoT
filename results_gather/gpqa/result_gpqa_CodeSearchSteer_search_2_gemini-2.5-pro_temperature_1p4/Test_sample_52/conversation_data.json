    "The chemical formula of the unknown compound is **C11H12O2**.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to arrive at this conclusion:\n\n### 1. Calculation of the Degree of Unsaturation\n\nThe degree of unsaturation (DoU) indicates the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule. Based on the structural information given:\n*   A 6-membered aromatic ring has 1 ring and 3 double bonds, which corresponds to a DoU of 4.\n*   An ester group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), contributing 1 to the DoU.\n*   The presence of two vinyl hydrogens indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), which adds another 1 to the DoU.\n\nThe total degree of unsaturation for the molecule is 4 (aromatic ring) + 1 (ester C=O) + 1 (vinyl C=C) = **6**.\n\nNext, we calculate the DoU for each of the proposed chemical formulas using the formula: DoU = C - H/2 + 1 (for molecules containing C, H, and O).\n*   **A) C12H12O2:** DoU = 12 - (12/2) + 1 = 7\n*   **B) C11H14O2:** DoU = 11 - (14/2) + 1 = 5\n*   **C) C12H14O2:** DoU = 12 - (14/2) + 1 = 6\n*   **D) C11H12O2:** DoU = 11 - (12/2) + 1 = 6.\n\nBased on this calculation, only formulas C12H14O2 and C11H12O2 are possible, as they have the required degree of unsaturation of 6.\n\n### 2. Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\nThe 1H NMR data provides the specific fragments of the molecule.\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This implies a `C6H4` group, which accounts for the two aromatic-H signals.\n*   **Vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This splitting pattern is characteristic of a `-CH=CH-CH3` (propenyl) group. The proton on the carbon with the methyl group is split by both the adjacent vinyl proton and the methyl protons, resulting in a doublet of quartets. The other vinyl proton is split only by its neighboring vinyl proton, giving a doublet. This fragment accounts for the two vinyl signals and one of the `–CH3` signals.\n*   **Two –CH3 signals:** One methyl group is part of the propenyl fragment. The second methyl group must be part of the ester functionality, suggesting either a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate group (`-OCOCH3`).\n*   **No –CH2 signals:** This is a crucial piece of information that helps differentiate between the remaining options.\n\n### 3. Assembling the Molecular Structure\n\nCombining these fragments leads to two plausible structures:\n\n*   **Structure 1: Methyl propenylbenzoate.** A `C6H4` ring is substituted with a `-CH=CH-CH3` group and a `-COOCH3` group.\n    *   **Atom Count:** C(6+3+2) H(4+5+3) O(2) = **C11H12O2**. This structure contains no `–CH2` groups.\n\n*   **Structure 2: Propenylphenyl acetate.** A `C6H4` ring is substituted with a `-CH=CH-CH3` group and an `-OCOCH3` group.\n    *   **Atom Count:** C(6+3+2) H(4+5+3) O(2) = **C11H12O2**. This structure also lacks any `–CH2` groups.\n\nBoth structures that perfectly fit the detailed spectral description have the molecular formula `C11H12O2`.\n\n### 4. Final Verification\n\nThe other possible formula, `C12H14O2`, contains an additional carbon and two additional hydrogens (`CH2`) compared to `C11H12O2`. Any plausible structure for `C12H14O2` that also fits the aromatic, ester, and vinyl group requirements (such as ethyl propenylbenzoate) would necessitate the presence of a `–CH2` group. Since the 1H NMR spectrum explicitly shows no signals for `–CH2` groups, the formula `C12H14O2` can be ruled out.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical formula that aligns with all the provided spectroscopic evidence is `C11H12O2`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
