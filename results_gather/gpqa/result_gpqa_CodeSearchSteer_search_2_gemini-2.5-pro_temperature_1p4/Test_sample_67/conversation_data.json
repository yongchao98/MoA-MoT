    "This problem describes a classic case of magnetic resonance and Larmor precession. A spin-1/2 particle, initially aligned with a magnetic field in the Z direction, is suddenly subjected to a magnetic field of the same strength but in the Y direction. This causes the particle's spin, and thus its magnetic moment, to precess around the new field direction.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the particle's motion:\n\n1.  **Initial State**: At time t=0, the particle's spin is aligned with the +Z direction. This means it is in a \"spin-up\" state with respect to the Z-axis.\n\n2.  **New Magnetic Field**: For t > 0, the magnetic field points along the +Y direction. According to the principles of quantum mechanics, a magnetic moment in a magnetic field experiences a torque, causing it to precess around the direction of the field.\n\n3.  **Larmor Precession**: This precession is known as Larmor precession. The angular frequency of this precession, called the Larmor frequency, is given by the product of the gyromagnetic ratio (γ) and the magnetic field strength (B). The time evolution of the spin is a rotation around the magnetic field axis with frequency ω = γB.\n\n4.  **Motion of the Spin**: The initial spin vector is pointing along the Z-axis. The new magnetic field is along the Y-axis. Therefore, the spin vector will start to precess in the X-Z plane around the Y-axis.\n\n5.  **Z-Component Oscillation**: As the spin vector rotates in the X-Z plane, its projection onto the Z-axis will change over time. This projection will oscillate between its initial maximum value and a minimum value with a cosine dependence. The expectation value of the z-component of the spin, `<Sz(t)>`, will be proportional to cos(ωt).\n\n6.  **Calculating the Frequency**: The angular frequency (ω) of this oscillation is the Larmor frequency.\n    *   ω = γB\n\nThe z-component of the magnetic moment is directly proportional to the z-component of the spin (μz = γ*Sz). Therefore, the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment will also oscillate with the same angular frequency.\n\nThe oscillation is described by `cos(γBt)`, and the angular frequency of this oscillation is the coefficient of `t`, which is `γB`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
