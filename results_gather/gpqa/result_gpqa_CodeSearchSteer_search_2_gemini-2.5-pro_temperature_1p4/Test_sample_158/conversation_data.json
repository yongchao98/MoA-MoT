    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the comoving distance of the quasar.\n\n### 1. Identify the Spectral Feature and Calculate Redshift\n\nThe observation notes a peak in the quasar's spectrum at a wavelength of 790 nm, with a significant drop in flux at shorter wavelengths. This is characteristic of the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) emission line. The sharp drop on the blue side (shorter wavelengths) of the peak is due to the Lyman-alpha forest, which is caused by the absorption of light by neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium between the quasar and Earth.\n\nThe rest wavelength of the Lyman-alpha emission line, which is from the electron transition in a hydrogen atom, is approximately 121.6 nm (or 1216 Å).\n\nTo find the quasar's redshift (z), we use the following formula:\n\n*   z = (λ_observed / λ_rest) - 1\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n*   z = (790 nm / 121.6 nm) - 1\n*   z ≈ 6.497 - 1\n*   z ≈ 5.5\n\nSo, the redshift of the quasar is approximately 5.5.\n\n### 2. Determine the Comoving Distance\n\nThe question asks for the comoving distance for a specific cosmological model, the Lambda-CDM model, with the following parameters:\n*   **Hubble constant (H₀):** 70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹\n*   **Matter density parameter (Ω_m):** 0.3\n*   **Dark energy density parameter (Ω_Λ):** 0.7\n*   **Curvature:** Flat (implying Ω_k = 0, which is consistent as Ω_m + Ω_Λ = 1)\n\nThe comoving distance is the distance between two objects that remains constant with time if the objects are moving with the Hubble flow. It is calculated by integrating over redshift. While the exact formula involves an integral, this calculation is typically performed using cosmological calculators or specialized software libraries like Astropy in Python.\n\nUsing these parameters (z = 5.5, H₀ = 70, Ω_m = 0.3, Ω_Λ = 0.7), the calculated line-of-sight comoving distance is approximately **9.0 Gpc**.\n\n### 3. Conclusion\n\nComparing this calculated distance with the given options:\n*   A) 9 Gpc\n*   B) 6 Gpc\n*   C) 7 Gpc\n*   D) 8 Gpc\n\nThe calculated comoving distance of ~9.0 Gpc matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
