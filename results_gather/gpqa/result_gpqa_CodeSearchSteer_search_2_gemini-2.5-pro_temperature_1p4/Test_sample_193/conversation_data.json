    "To find the partition function Z of the system, we need to sum the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE), over all possible states of the system. A state is defined by the specific values of the three spins S1, S2, and S3. Since each spin can take a value of +1 or -1, there are a total of 2³ = 8 possible microstates.\n\nThe energy of the system is given by the equation:\nE = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]\n\nLet's calculate the energy for each of the 8 possible states:\n\n1.  **All spins up:**\n    *   State: (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, +1)\n    *   Energy: E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\n2.  **Two spins up, one spin down:** There are three such states.\n    *   State: (+1, +1, -1) -> E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = J\n    *   State: (+1, -1, +1) -> E = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = J\n    *   State: (-1, +1, +1) -> E = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = J\n    All three of these states have the same energy, E = J.\n\n3.  **One spin up, two spins down:** There are three such states.\n    *   State: (+1, -1, -1) -> E = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = J\n    *   State: (-1, +1, -1) -> E = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = J\n    *   State: (-1, -1, +1) -> E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = J\n    All three of these states also have the energy, E = J.\n\n4.  **All spins down:**\n    *   State: (-1, -1, -1)\n    *   Energy: E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\nNow, let's summarize the energy levels and their degeneracies (the number of states with a given energy):\n*   Energy level E₁ = -3J has a degeneracy g₁ = 2 (the state with all spins up and the state with all spins down).\n*   Energy level E₂ = J has a degeneracy g₂ = 6 (the three states with two spins up and the three states with one spin up).\n\nThe partition function Z is the sum over all states, which can be calculated by summing over the energy levels multiplied by their degeneracies:\nZ = Σᵢ gᵢ * e^(-βEᵢ)\nZ = g₁ * e^(-βE₁) + g₂ * e^(-βE₂)\nZ = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(J))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\nB) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\nC) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\nD) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\n\nThe calculated partition function matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
