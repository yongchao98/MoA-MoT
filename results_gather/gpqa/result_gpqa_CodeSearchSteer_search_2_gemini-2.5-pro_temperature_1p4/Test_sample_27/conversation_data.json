    "The reaction proceeds through a series of stereocontrolled steps to build a complex substituted cyclohexanone ring. Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Protection of the hydroxyl group**\nThe starting material, (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one, is treated with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride (TBSCl) and triethylamine. This reaction protects the alcohol functional group as a bulky tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBS) ether. The stereochemistry at the C4 carbon remains (S). Product 1 is (S)-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)cyclohex-2-en-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Conjugate addition followed by alkylation**\nProduct 1 undergoes a 1,4-conjugate addition (or Michael addition) with lithium diphenylcuprate (Ph₂CuLi). The phenyl nucleophile adds to the β-carbon (C3) of the α,β-unsaturated ketone. To minimize steric hindrance, the phenyl group adds from the face opposite (anti) to the bulky TBSO-group at C4. With the C4 substituent having an (S) configuration (directing \"up\"), the phenyl group adds from the \"down\" face, resulting in a (3R) configuration.\n\nThis addition forms a lithium enolate intermediate, which is then trapped by the electrophile, benzyl bromide. The alkylation occurs at the α-carbon (C2). The benzyl group adds anti to the adjacent, newly-added phenyl group at C3. With the C3-phenyl group being \"down\", the C2-benzyl group adds from the \"up\" face, leading to a (2S) configuration. Thus, Product 2 is (2S,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 3: Second α-alkylation**\nProduct 2 is treated with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA), a strong, sterically hindered base, followed by iodomethane (CH₃I). LDA deprotonates the ketone at the most accessible α-carbon. Since the C2 carbon is already substituted with a benzyl group and has no protons, deprotonation occurs at the C6 carbon. The resulting enolate then reacts with iodomethane to add a methyl group at the C6 position. The existing bulky substituents on the ring direct the incoming methyl group to the sterically favored equatorial position, resulting in a (6S) configuration. Product 3 is (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-6-methyl-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 4: Deprotection**\nFinally, the compound is treated with aqueous HCl. This acidic workup removes the TBS protecting group from the oxygen at C4, regenerating the hydroxyl group. This step does not affect the stereochemistry of the carbon skeleton.\n\nThe final product, 4, is therefore **(2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one**. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
