    "To determine the correct answer, we must perform two main calculations:\n1.  Calculate the minimum volume of the 0.1 M strong acid required to completely dissolve the 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃.\n2.  Calculate the pH of the resulting 100 cm³ solution.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Volume of Acid\n\nFirst, we write the balanced chemical equation for the dissolution of iron(III) hydroxide in a strong acid (represented by H⁺):\n\n**Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)**\n\nThis equation shows that 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ reacts with 3 moles of H⁺ ions.\n\nNext, we calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃:\n*   The molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ is the sum of the atomic masses of its elements: Fe (55.845 g/mol) + 3 × [O (15.999 g/mol) + H (1.008 g/mol)] = 106.866 g/mol.\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 0.0009357 moles.\n\nNow, we determine the moles of H⁺ needed using the stoichiometry from the balanced equation (1:3 ratio):\n*   Moles of H⁺ = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 × 0.0009357 mol ≈ 0.002807 moles.\n\nFinally, we calculate the volume of the 0.1 M strong acid solution required to provide these moles of H⁺:\n*   Volume (L) = Moles of H⁺ / Molarity = 0.002807 mol / 0.1 mol/L ≈ 0.02807 L.\n*   To convert this to cm³, we multiply by 1000:\n    Volume (cm³) = 0.02807 L × 1000 cm³/L ≈ **28.07 cm³**.\n\nThis calculated volume is very close to the value in option B (28.05 cm³).\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the pH of the Resulting Solution\n\nAfter the Fe(OH)₃ dissolves completely, the 0.0009357 moles of the resulting Fe³⁺ ions are in a total volume of 100 cm³ (0.1 L). The concentration of Fe³⁺ is:\n*   [Fe³⁺] = Moles of Fe³⁺ / Total Volume (L) = 0.0009357 mol / 0.1 L ≈ 0.009357 M.\n\nThe Fe³⁺ ion, as an aqua ion [Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺, hydrolyzes in water, acting as a weak acid and establishing the following equilibrium:\n\n**[Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ [Fe(H₂O)₅(OH)]²⁺(aq) + H₃O⁺(aq)**\n\nThe resulting solution is acidic due to the production of hydronium ions (H₃O⁺). To find the pH, we need the acid dissociation constant (Ka) for this reaction. Standard chemistry tables provide the Ka for the Fe³⁺(aq) ion at 25°C as approximately **6.3 x 10⁻³**.\n\nWe can set up an ICE table to find the equilibrium concentration of H₃O⁺:\n*   Initial concentration of [Fe³⁺] = 0.009357 M\n*   Initial concentration of [H₃O⁺] ≈ 0 M\n*   Change in concentration: -x for [Fe³⁺], +x for [Fe(H₂O)₅(OH)]²⁺ and +x for [H₃O⁺]\n*   Equilibrium concentration: [Fe³⁺] = 0.009357 - x; [H₃O⁺] = x\n\nThe Ka expression is: Ka = [H₃O⁺] [Fe(H₂O)₅(OH)]²⁺ / [[Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺]\n*   6.3 x 10⁻³ = (x)(x) / (0.009357 - x)\n*   x² = (6.3 x 10⁻³)(0.009357 - x)\n*   x² = 5.895 x 10⁻⁵ - 6.3 x 10⁻³ x\n*   x² + 0.0063x - 0.00005895 = 0\n\nWe solve this quadratic equation for x (the concentration of H₃O⁺):\n*   Using the quadratic formula, x = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / 2a, we get a positive root of x ≈ 0.00515.\n\nThe concentration of H₃O⁺ at equilibrium is approximately 0.00515 M.\n\nNow, we calculate the pH:\n*   pH = -log[H₃O⁺] = -log(0.00515) ≈ **2.29**.\n\nThis pH value (2.29) is reasonably close to the pH given in option B (2.04), considering potential variations in the cited Ka value and slight differences in calculation approaches. For instance, another source lists a Ka value of 6.5 x 10⁻³, which would yield a slightly different pH. However, the calculated volume of acid (28.07 cm³) is a very strong match for option B. Combining the results, option B is the most plausible answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
