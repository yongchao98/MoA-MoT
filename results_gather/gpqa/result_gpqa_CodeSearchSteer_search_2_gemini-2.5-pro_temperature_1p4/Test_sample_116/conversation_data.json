    "Here is a breakdown of the optical isomerism for each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:** This molecule is a type of biphenyl. Biphenyls can exhibit a form of optical isomerism called atropisomerism when there is restricted rotation around the single bond that connects the two phenyl rings. This restricted rotation is caused by bulky groups in the ortho positions (the positions next to the connecting bond). In this specific molecule, all four ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6') have large substituents (two nitro groups and two dimethyl carboxylate groups). These bulky groups prevent the rings from rotating freely, which can lead to two stable, non-superimposable mirror-image forms called enantiomers. Therefore, this compound shows optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The IUPAC name for this compound is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, and it is also known as methyl lactate. Its central carbon atom (C2) is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). A carbon atom with four distinct substituents is known as a chiral center. Molecules containing a single chiral center are optically active, meaning they can exist as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers). Thus, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone:** The chemical name for benzophenone is diphenylmethanone. The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and also bonded to two phenyl groups. Because the two phenyl groups are identical, there is no chiral center. The molecule possesses planes of symmetry and is therefore achiral. As a result, benzophenone does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the trans-isomer of an alkene, with two methyl ester groups on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon double bond. It has a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion, which means it is an achiral molecule. Consequently, dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism.\n\nBased on this analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate are the two compounds that show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<B>>>"
