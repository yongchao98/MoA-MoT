    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and the number of its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine**\nCyclohexanone reacts with bromine (Br₂) in an alpha-halogenation reaction. This places a bromine atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide**\nWhen an α-halo ketone, such as 2-bromocyclohexanone, is treated with a strong base like sodium hydroxide, it undergoes a classic reaction known as the Favorskii rearrangement. This reaction involves the formation of a cyclopropanone intermediate, followed by nucleophilic attack by hydroxide and subsequent ring-opening, which results in a ring contraction. The six-membered cyclohexanone ring is converted into a five-membered cyclopentane ring with a carboxylic acid group.\n\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine**\nThis is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. The thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) chlorinates the carboxylic acid, with pyridine acting as a base to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride**\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(Ot-Bu)₃) is a mild reducing agent specifically used to reduce highly reactive acid chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to an alcohol. The bulky tert-butoxy groups moderate the reactivity of the hydride reagent.\n\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde\n\n**Determining the Number of Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we need to analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\nThe cyclopentanecarbaldehyde molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (CHO) and the C1 carbon it's attached to, bisecting the ring. This symmetry makes certain pairs of protons chemically equivalent.\n\n1.  **Aldehyde proton:** The single proton of the -CHO group is in a unique chemical environment. (1 distinct type)\n2.  **C1 proton:** The single proton on the carbon to which the aldehyde is attached (C1) is also unique. (1 distinct type)\n3.  **C2 and C5 protons:** The protons on C2 and C5 are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, the two protons on C2 itself are not equivalent (they are diastereotopic) because C1 is a stereocenter. This means the proton \"cis\" to the aldehyde group has a different chemical shift from the proton that is \"trans\". This gives two sets of equivalent protons: the two \"cis\" protons on C2/C5 are one type, and the two \"trans\" protons on C2/C5 are another type. (2 distinct types)\n4.  **C3 and C4 protons:** Similarly, the protons on C3 and C4 are equivalent to each other by symmetry. The two protons on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic. This results in two more distinct proton types: the two \"cis-like\" protons on C3/C4 and the two \"trans-like\" protons on C3/C4. (2 distinct types)\n\nCounting these up: 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (C1) + 2 (C2/C5) + 2 (C3/C4) = **6** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms.\n\nTherefore, there are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
