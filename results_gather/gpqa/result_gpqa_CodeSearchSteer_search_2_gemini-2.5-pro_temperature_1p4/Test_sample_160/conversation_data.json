    "This scenario requires a comparison between the mean free path (MFP) of gas molecules colliding with each other (λ1) and the MFP of high-energy electrons scattering off those same gas molecules (λ2). The key to this comparison lies in the fundamental formula for the mean free path.\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions and is inversely proportional to the collision cross-section (σ), which is the effective area that a target presents for a collision. The formula is generally expressed as λ = 1/(nσ), where 'n' is the number density of the target particles. In Mike's experiment, the number density 'n' of the gas molecules is constant for both situations. Therefore, the relationship between λ1 and λ2 is determined by the inverse relationship of their respective cross-sections.\n\n*   **λ1 (Gas Molecule - Gas Molecule):** This is the mean free path of gas molecules moving among themselves. A collision occurs when two molecules, each with a kinetic radius 'r', come close enough to interact. The effective target area, or collision cross-section (σ_gas), is approximately π(r+r)² = π(2r)² = 4πr². This considers the size of both the projectile and target molecules. For particles in thermal motion, a more precise formula is λ1 = 1/(√2 * n * πd²), where d is the molecular diameter (d=2r).\n*   **λ2 (Electron - Gas Molecule):** This is the mean free path for an electron from the beam scattering off a gas molecule. An electron is considered a point particle, meaning its own radius is negligible compared to the gas molecule. In this case, a collision or scattering event happens if the electron passes through the target area of the molecule. In a simplified hard-sphere model, this cross-section (σ_e-gas) is simply the area of the gas molecule itself: πr². Because the electrons in the beam are moving much faster than the gas molecules, we can treat the molecules as stationary targets, and the formula is λ2 ≈ 1/(n * πr²).\n\n**Comparing λ1 and λ2:**\n\nBased on the simplified models:\n*   σ_gas (molecule-molecule) is proportional to π(2r)².\n*   σ_e-gas (electron-molecule) is proportional to πr².\n\nThis means the collision cross-section for two gas molecules is roughly four times larger than the scattering cross-section for a point-like electron hitting a gas molecule.\n\nSince the mean free path is inversely proportional to the cross-section (λ ∝ 1/σ), a smaller cross-section results in a longer mean free path. Because σ_e-gas < σ_gas, it follows directly that λ2 > λ1.\n\nTo be more quantitative, the ratio is approximately:\nλ2 / λ1 ≈ σ_gas / σ_e-gas ≈ (4πr²) / (πr²) = 4.\n\nIf we include the √2 factor for the gas-gas MFP, the ratio becomes λ2/λ1 ≈ 4√2 ≈ 5.66.\n\nIn either case, the mean free path for an electron scattering off gas molecules (λ2) is significantly larger than the mean free path for the gas molecules colliding with each other (λ1). Mike's observation is therefore consistent with physical principles. Given the options, λ2 is substantially larger than λ1.\n\n<<<D>>>"
