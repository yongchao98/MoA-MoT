    "Radioactive decay is a random process governed by the laws of quantum mechanics. A key principle is that the decay probability of a single atomic nucleus is constant over any given time interval and does not depend on how long the atom has already existed. This is known as the \"memoryless\" property of exponential decay. Therefore, the fact that the atom has not decayed for 50 minutes does not influence its future decay probability.\n\nTo solve the problem, we first determine the decay constant (λ), which is the probability of decay per unit time. We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%.\n\nThe probability of an atom *surviving* a time interval *t* is given by the formula:\nP(survival) = e^(-λt)\n\nFrom the given data, the probability of surviving 100 minutes is:\nP(survival in 100 min) = 1 - P(decay in 100 min) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n\nNow we can find the decay constant λ:\n0.68 = e^(-λ * 100)\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\nln(0.68) = -100λ\nλ = -ln(0.68) / 100\n\nNext, we need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes. Because of the memoryless nature of radioactive decay, this is equivalent to finding the decay probability of a new atom over a 150-minute period.\n\nThe probability of decay within 150 minutes is:\nP(decay in 150 min) = 1 - P(survival in 150 min)\nP(decay in 150 min) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\n\nSubstituting the expression we found for λ:\nP = 1 - e^([-ln(0.68) / 100] * 150)\nP = 1 - e^(1.5 * ln(0.68))\nUsing the logarithm property x * ln(y) = ln(y^x):\nP = 1 - e^(ln(0.68^1.5))\nSince e^ln(x) = x:\nP = 1 - (0.68)^1.5\n\nCalculating the final value:\nP ≈ 1 - 0.5607\nP ≈ 0.4393\n\nThis probability is approximately 43.93%, which rounds to 44%.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
