    "The search results confirm the validity of using the conservation of total relativistic energy to solve this problem. The total energy is the sum of the potential energy and the particle's relativistic energy (rest energy + kinetic energy).\n\nLet's re-state the steps of the derivation to ensure complete clarity and accuracy, cross-referencing with the performed thought process.\n\n1.  **Define the total energy of the system:** The total conserved energy (E_total) of the relativistic harmonic oscillator is the sum of its relativistic energy (E) and its potential energy (U).\n    *   E_total = E + U(x)\n    *   The relativistic energy E is given by γmc², where γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²).\n    *   The potential energy for a spring obeying Hooke's law is U(x) = (1/2)kx².\n\n2.  **Analyze the energy at the point of maximum amplitude (x = A):**\n    *   At this turning point, the velocity of the mass is momentarily zero (v = 0).\n    *   Therefore, the Lorentz factor γ becomes 1.\n    *   The relativistic energy is E = 1 * mc² = mc² (this is the rest energy).\n    *   The potential energy is U(A) = (1/2)kA².\n    *   So, the total energy of the system is E_total = mc² + (1/2)kA².\n\n3.  **Analyze the energy at the equilibrium point (x = 0):**\n    *   At the equilibrium point, the potential energy is zero, U(0) = 0.\n    *   The speed is at its maximum value, v = v_max.\n    *   The relativistic energy is E = γ(v_max)mc², where γ(v_max) = 1 / √(1 - v_max²/c²).\n    *   So, the total energy of the system at this point is E_total = γ(v_max)mc².\n\n4.  **Apply the principle of conservation of energy:** The total energy at both points must be equal.\n    *   mc² + (1/2)kA² = γ(v_max)mc²\n\n5.  **Solve for v_max:**\n    *   Divide by mc²: 1 + (kA²) / (2mc²) = γ(v_max)\n    *   Substitute the definition of γ: 1 + (kA²) / (2mc²) = 1 / √(1 - v_max²/c²)\n    *   Invert both sides: 1 / [1 + (kA²) / (2mc²)] = √(1 - v_max²/c²)\n    *   Square both sides: 1 / [1 + (kA²) / (2mc²)]² = 1 - v_max²/c²\n    *   Rearrange: v_max²/c² = 1 - 1 / [1 + (kA²) / (2mc²)]²\n    *   Take the square root and multiply by c: v_max = c * √[1 - 1 / (1 + (kA²) / (2mc²))²]\n\nThis derivation is sound and the resulting formula matches option A exactly. The classical (non-relativistic) case can be recovered from this equation if we consider the relativistic correction term (kA² / (2mc²)) to be very small compared to 1.\n\nThe derivation is confirmed as correct. The final answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
