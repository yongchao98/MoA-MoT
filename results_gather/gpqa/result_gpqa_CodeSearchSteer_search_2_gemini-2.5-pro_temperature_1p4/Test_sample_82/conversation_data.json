    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the pH at both points in the titration.\n\n### 1. Initial Dilution of Acetic Acid\n\nFirst, we calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted with water.\n*   **Initial concentration of acetic acid (M₁):** 0.05 M\n*   **Initial volume of acetic acid (V₁):** 20.00 cm³\n*   **Final volume (V₂):** 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\nUsing the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂, the new concentration (M₂) is:\nM₂ = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = **0.025 M**\n\n### 2. pH at 25% Titration\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (CH₃COOH) has reacted with the sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). This creates a buffer solution.\n\nWe can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH.\n**pH = pKa + log ([A⁻]/[HA])**\nWhere:\n*   **[HA]** is the concentration of the weak acid (acetic acid).\n*   **[A⁻]** is the concentration of the conjugate base (acetate).\n*   **pKa** = -log(Ka)\n\nFirst, calculate the pKa from the given Ka value (1.85x10⁻⁵):\n*   pKa = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ **4.73**\n\nAt 25% titration, the ratio of the conjugate base to the acid is:\n*   [A⁻] = 25%\n*   [HA] = 100% - 25% = 75%\n*   Ratio [A⁻]/[HA] = 25 / 75 = 1/3\n\nNow, substitute these values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n*   pH = 4.73 + log(1/3)\n*   pH = 4.73 - 0.477\n*   **pH ≈ 4.26**\n\n### 3. pH at the Equivalence Point\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH, and the solution contains only the conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The acetate ion will then react with water (hydrolysis), which will make the solution basic.\n\n**Step 1: Find the total volume and concentration of acetate.**\n*   **Initial moles of acetic acid:** 0.025 M * 0.040 L = 0.001 moles\n*   At the equivalence point, moles of NaOH added equals the initial moles of acetic acid (0.001 moles).\n*   **Volume of NaOH added:** Moles / Molarity = 0.001 moles / 0.1 M = 0.010 L or 10.00 cm³\n*   **Total volume at equivalence point:** 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ or 0.050 L\n*   **Concentration of acetate [CH₃COO⁻]:** 0.001 moles / 0.050 L = **0.02 M**\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the pH of the weak base solution.**\nThe acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) acts as a weak base:\nCH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n\nWe need the base dissociation constant, Kb.\n*   Kw (ion product of water at 25°C) = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴\n*   Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n*   **Kb = Kw / Ka** = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n\nNow, calculate the concentration of hydroxide ions [OH⁻] produced by the hydrolysis of acetate.\n*   **[OH⁻] = √(Kb * [CH₃COO⁻])**\n*   [OH⁻] = √(5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ * 0.02)\n*   [OH⁻] = √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the pOH and then the pH.**\n*   **pOH = -log[OH⁻]** = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n*   **pH = 14 - pOH** = 14 - 5.48 = **8.52**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   pH at 25% titration ≈ **4.26**\n*   pH at the equivalence point ≈ **8.52**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
