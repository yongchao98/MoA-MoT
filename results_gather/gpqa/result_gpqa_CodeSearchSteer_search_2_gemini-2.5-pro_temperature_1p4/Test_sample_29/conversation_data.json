    "To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we must first calculate the wavelength and color of the light it *emits*. The key principle to then apply is that of fluorescence, where a substance absorbs light at a higher energy and emits light at a lower energy.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Wavelength of Emitted Light\n\nThe energy of the emitted light is given as 2.3393 eV. The relationship between energy (E) in electron-volts (eV) and wavelength (λ) in nanometers (nm) is given by the formula:\n\nλ (nm) = 1240 / E (eV)\n\nPlugging in the given energy:\n\nλ = 1240 / 2.3393 eV ≈ 530.07 nm\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Color of Emitted Light\n\nA wavelength of approximately 530 nm falls within the green portion of the visible light spectrum. Therefore, the textile dye emits green light.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Absorbed Color\n\nThe process described, where a compound absorbs light and then emits light of a different color, is called fluorescence. A fundamental principle of fluorescence, known as Stokes shift, is that the emitted light always has a lower energy (and thus a longer wavelength) than the absorbed light. This is because the molecule loses some energy through non-radiative processes after absorption and before emission.\n\nThis means the absorbed light must have an energy *greater* than 2.3393 eV and a wavelength *shorter* than 530 nm. Now we can evaluate the options:\n*   **A) Violet:** Wavelengths of ~380-450 nm and energies of ~3.26-2.75 eV. This is higher energy than the green light emitted.\n*   **B) Yellow:** Wavelengths of ~570-590 nm and energies of ~2.17-2.10 eV. This is lower energy than the light emitted, which is physically not possible for this process.\n*   **C) Blue:** Wavelengths of ~450-495 nm and energies of ~2.75-2.50 eV. This is higher energy than the green light emitted.\n*   **D) Red:** Wavelengths of ~620-750 nm and energies of ~2.0-1.65 eV. This is lower energy than the light emitted, which is also not possible.\n\nBoth violet and blue light have sufficient energy to cause the green fluorescence. In typical fluorescence, the absorption and emission spectra are relatively close. For a substance that emits green light (~530 nm), it is most commonly excited by absorbing blue light. For instance, some materials are excited with 405 nm (violet) light to fluoresce at 512 nm (green), demonstrating this principle. Given the choices, blue light is the most plausible color absorbed to produce green emission.\n\nIt is important not to confuse this with the concept of complementary colors in the context of reflected light. An object that *appears* green by reflecting light does so because it absorbs red light. However, this question describes light *emission* (fluorescence), which follows different physical rules.\n\n<<<C>>>"
