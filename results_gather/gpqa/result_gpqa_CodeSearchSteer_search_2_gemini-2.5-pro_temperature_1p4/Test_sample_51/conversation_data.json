    "This problem requires the application of the Boltzmann equation, which describes the statistical distribution of atoms among their various energy levels when in thermal equilibrium.\n\n### Key Principles:\n\n1.  **Boltzmann Equation**: The ratio of the number of atoms (N) in two different energy levels (level 2 and level 1) is given by:\n    `N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T))`\n    where `g` is the statistical weight, `E` is the energy of the level, `k` is the Boltzmann constant, and `T` is the temperature. The statistical weights `g₁` and `g₂` are not provided, so we assume they are equal, or that the ratio `g₂/g₁` is constant and cancels out when we compare the population ratios at two different temperatures.\n\n2.  **Photon Energy**: The energy difference between the two levels (`E₂ - E₁`, or `ΔE`) corresponds to the energy of a photon emitted or absorbed during the transition. This energy is related to the photon's wavelength (λ) by the Planck-Einstein relation.\n    `ΔE = h * c / λ`\n    where `h` is Planck's constant and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n### Given Information:\n\n*   Temperature without spots (`T_nospots`): 6000 K\n*   Effective temperature with spots (`T_spots`): 5500 K\n*   Wavelength of transition (`λ`): 1448 Å = 1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n**1. Calculate the energy difference (ΔE) between the two levels.**\nUsing the formula `ΔE = hc / λ` and the values for Planck's constant (`h` ≈ 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) and the speed of light (`c` ≈ 3.0 x 10⁸ m/s):\n*   `ΔE = (6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s * 3.0 x 10⁸ m/s) / (1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)`\n*   `ΔE ≈ 1.373 x 10⁻¹⁸ J`\n\n**2. Set up the ratio for each temperature.**\nLet `R` be the ratio `N₂ / N₁`.\n*   Ratio without spots: `R_nospots = C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots))`\n*   Ratio with spots: `R_spots = C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots))`\nwhere C is the constant `g₂ / g₁`.\n\n**3. Determine the factor of change.**\nThe question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star has no spots compared to when it has spots. This corresponds to the fraction `R_nospots / R_spots`.\n*   `Factor = R_nospots / R_spots = exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots))`\n*   `Factor = exp[(-ΔE / k) * (1 / T_nospots - 1 / T_spots)]`\n\n**4. Substitute the values and solve.**\nFirst, we calculate the term `ΔE / k` using the value for the Boltzmann constant (`k` ≈ 1.380 x 10⁻²³ J/K):\n*   `ΔE / k ≈ (1.373 x 10⁻¹⁸ J) / (1.380 x 10⁻²³ J/K) ≈ 99490 K`\n\nNow, substitute this into the factor equation:\n*   `Factor = exp[-99490 * (1/6000 - 1/5500)]`\n*   `1/6000 - 1/5500 = (5500 - 6000) / (6000 * 5500) = -500 / 33,000,000 = -1 / 66,000`\n*   `Factor = exp[-99490 * (-1 / 66,000)] = exp(99490 / 66,000)`\n*   `Factor = exp(1.507)`\n*   `Factor ≈ 4.51`\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately 4.5, which aligns with option A. The information regarding the star's radius, mass, and the percentage of spot coverage is not needed for this calculation, as the relevant temperatures are provided directly.\n\n<<<A>>>"
