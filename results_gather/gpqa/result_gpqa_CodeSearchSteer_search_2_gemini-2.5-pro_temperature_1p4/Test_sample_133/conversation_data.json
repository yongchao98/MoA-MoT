    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the enthalpy of neutralization.\n\n**1. Identify Reactants and their Nature:**\n*   **HCl (Hydrochloric acid):** Strong acid\n*   **H2SO4 (Sulfuric acid):** Strong acid\n*   **Ba(OH)2 (Barium hydroxide):** Strong base\n\n**2. Calculate the Moles of H+ Ions (from acids):**\n*   **From HCl:** Moles of H+ = Molarity × Volume in Liters\n    *   Moles = 0.2 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.10 mol H+\n*   **From H2SO4:** H2SO4 is diprotic, meaning it releases two H+ ions.\n    *   Moles of H+ = 2 × Molarity × Volume in Liters\n    *   Moles = 2 × 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.18 mol H+\n*   **Total Moles of H+:** 0.10 mol + 0.18 mol = 0.28 mol\n\n**3. Calculate the Moles of OH- Ions (from the base):**\n*   **From Ba(OH)2:** Ba(OH)2 is a diacidic base, meaning it releases two OH- ions.\n    *   Moles of OH- = 2 × Molarity × Volume in Liters\n    *   Moles = 2 × 0.5 mol/L × 0.200 L = 0.20 mol OH-\n\n**4. Determine the Limiting Reactant for Neutralization:**\nThe neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.\n*   We have 0.28 mol of H+ and 0.20 mol of OH-.\n*   Since there are fewer moles of OH-, it is the limiting reactant.\n*   This means that 0.20 moles of OH- will react with 0.20 moles of H+ to form **0.20 moles of water**.\n\n**5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Neutralization:**\nThe standard enthalpy of neutralization for a strong acid reacting with a strong base is approximately -13.6 kcal per mole of water formed.\n*   Total Enthalpy = Moles of water formed × Enthalpy per mole\n*   Total Enthalpy = 0.20 mol × (-13.6 kcal/mol)\n*   **Total Enthalpy = -2.72 kcal**\n\n**Consideration of Precipitation:**\nIn this reaction, barium ions (Ba2+) from Ba(OH)2 and sulfate ions (SO4^2-) from H2SO4 will also react to form a solid precipitate, barium sulfate (BaSO4). This precipitation reaction also releases heat.\n\nHowever, in many chemistry problems of this type, the question specifically asks for the \"enthalpy of neutralization,\" which refers only to the heat evolved from the formation of water. The fact that our calculated value of -2.72 kcal exactly matches one of the options confirms that only the heat from the acid-base neutralization is to be considered for this problem.\n\n<<<A>>>"
