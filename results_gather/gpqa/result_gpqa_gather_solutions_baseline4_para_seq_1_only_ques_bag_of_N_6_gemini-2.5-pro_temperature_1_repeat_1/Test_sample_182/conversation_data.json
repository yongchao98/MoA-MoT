Let's break down its structure to identify its key features.\n    *   **`cyclohex`**: Indicates a six-membered carbon ring.\n    *   **`-3-ene`**: Indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) within the ring, starting at position 3 (between C3 and C4).\n    *   **`carboxylic acid`**: Indicates a -COOH group. As the principal functional group, it is located at position C1.\n    *   **`2-formyl`**: Indicates an aldehyde group (-CHO) at position C2.\n    *   **`5-vinyl`**: Indicates a vinyl group (-CH=CH2) at position C5.\n\n    From this structure, we can identify the features that contribute to the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), which is also known as the degree of unsaturation. IHD is the sum of the number of rings and the number of pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n    *   One ring (the cyclohexene ring): IHD +1\n    *   One C=C bond in the ring: IHD +1\n    *   One C=O bond in the carboxylic acid group: IHD +1\n    *   One C=O bond in the formyl group: IHD +1\n    *   One C=C bond in the vinyl group: IHD +1\n    *   Total IHD of the reactant = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n\n    We can also determine the molecular formula to verify this.\n    *   Carbons (C): 6 in the ring + 1 in COOH + 1 in CHO + 2 in vinyl = 10 carbons.\n    *   Hydrogens (H): After drawing the structure and ensuring each carbon has 4 bonds, we find there are 12 hydrogens. (C1(H), C2(H), C3(H), C4(H), C5(H), C6(H2), COOH(H), CHO(H), vinyl(H3)). Total H = 7 (on ring) + 5 (on substituents) = 12.\n    *   Oxygens (O): 2 in COOH + 1 in CHO = 3 oxygens.\n    *   Molecular Formula of reactant: C10H12O3.\n    *   IHD formula: IHD = C + 1 - H/2. (Oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation).\n    *   IHD(reactant) = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 11 - 6 = 5. This confirms the structural analysis.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the Reaction**\n    The reagent is red phosphorus and excess of HI (Red P + HI). This is a very strong reducing agent. It performs a complete reduction of most oxygen-containing functional groups and carbon-carbon multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated alkane forms.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   The formyl (aldehyde) group (-CHO) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   The C=C double bond in the cyclohexene ring will be reduced to a C-C single bond.\n    *   The C=C double bond in the vinyl group (-CH=CH2) will be reduced to an ethyl group (-CH2-CH3).\n    *   Importantly, the carbon-carbon single bonds of the ring are stable and will not be broken. The ring structure is preserved.\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the Structure and IHD of the Product**\n    The reaction reduces all pi bonds and removes all oxygen atoms, but it does not open the ring.\n    *   The product will be a saturated hydrocarbon.\n    *   The product will still contain the six-membered ring.\n    *   Since all C=C and C=O bonds are gone, the product will have zero pi bonds.\n\n    We can now calculate the IHD of the product based on its structure.\n    *   Number of rings = 1 (the cyclohexane ring remains).\n    *   Number of pi bonds = 0 (all have been reduced).\n    *   IHD(product) = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\n*   **Step 4: Verify with the Molecular Formula of the Product**\n    The starting material had a C10 skeleton, which is preserved. The product is therefore a C10 saturated cycloalkane (a substituted cyclohexane). The general formula for a monocyclic alkane is CnH2n.\n    *   Since n=10, the molecular formula of the product is C10H20.\n    *   Using the IHD formula: IHD = C + 1 - H/2.\n    *   IHD(product) = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\n    Both methods yield the same result. The index of hydrogen deficiency of the final product is 1.\n\n*   **Step 5: Match with the given options**\n    The calculated IHD is 1, which corresponds to option C.\n    A) 0\n    B) 5 (This is the IHD of the reactant)\n    C) 1\n    D) 3\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\n**1.

By convention, this is at position C1.\n    *   `2-formyl`: A -CHO (aldehyde) group at position C2.\n    *   `5-vinyl`: A -CH=CH2 group at position C5.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Let's determine the molecular formula of the reactant.\n    *   Carbon atoms (C): 6 in the ring + 1 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO + 2 in -CH=CH2 = 10 carbons (C10).\n    *   Oxygen atoms (O): 2 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO = 3 oxygens (O3).\n    *   Hydrogen atoms (H): We can find this by calculating the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) first from the structure, as it's less error-prone.\n*   **Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Reactant:**\n    The IHD (or degree of unsaturation) is the sum of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n    *   One ring (cyclohexane structure) = 1\n    *   One C=C double bond in the ring (cyclohex-3-ene) = 1\n    *   One C=C double bond in the vinyl group = 1\n    *   One C=O double bond in the formyl group = 1\n    *   One C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group = 1\n    *   **Total IHD of reactant = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.**\n\n    We can now verify the number of hydrogens using the IHD formula: IHD = C + 1 - H/2 (ignoring oxygen).\n    5 = 10 + 1 - H/2\n    5 = 11 - H/2\n    H/2 = 6\n    H = 12\n    So, the molecular formula of the reactant is **C10H12O3**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (Red P) and excess hydroiodic acid (HI).\n*   **Type of Reaction:** This combination of reagents is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known for the complete reduction of oxygen-containing functional groups and carbon-carbon multiple bonds.\n    *   Carboxylic acids (-COOH) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH3).\n    *   Aldehydes (-CHO) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH3).\n    *   Alkenes (C=C) are reduced to alkanes (C-C).\n    *   The ring structure itself (made of sigma bonds) is not broken under these conditions.\n\n**3. Determine the Product**\n\n*   Applying the reduction to the reactant:\n    *   The -COOH group at C1 is reduced to a -CH3 group.\n    *   The -CHO group at C2 is reduced to a -CH3 group.\n    *   The C=C double bond in the ring is reduced to a C-C single bond.\n    *   The C=C double bond in the vinyl group is reduced, converting it to an ethyl (-CH2CH3) group.\n*   The final product is **5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane**. This is a saturated molecule (contains only single bonds) with a ring structure.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\n*   We can determine the IHD of the product in two ways:\n\n    **Method 1: Based on the structural changes.**\n    The reaction removes all the pi bonds from the reactant.\n    *   Initial IHD = 5 (1 ring + 4 π bonds).\n    *   The 4 π bonds (one C=C in the ring, one C=C in vinyl, one C=O in formyl, one C=O in carboxylic acid) are all reduced (removed).\n    *   The ring structure remains.\n    *   Final IHD = Initial IHD - (number of π bonds removed)\n    *   Final IHD = 5 - 4 = 1.\n    *   The remaining IHD of 1 corresponds to the single ring in the product molecule.\n\n    **Method 2: Based on the molecular formula of the product.**\n    *   The product is 5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane.\n    *   The carbon skeleton is C10 (as determined for the reactant).\n    *   The product is a substituted cycloalkane. A saturated hydrocarbon with one ring has the general formula CnH2n.\n    *   For n=10, the formula is C10H20.\n    *   Now, we calculate the IHD for C10H20:\n        IHD = C + 1 - H/2\n        IHD = 10 + 1 - 20/2\n        IHD = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.

Analyze the Reactant**\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down its structure to understand its components and calculate its initial index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD). The IHD (also known as the degree of unsaturation) represents the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n\n*   **Cyclohex-3-ene**: This is a six-membered carbon ring containing one carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n    *   The ring itself contributes 1 to the IHD.\n    *   The C=C double bond within the ring contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **Carboxylic acid**: This is a -COOH group.

It contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n    *   The C=C double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n\n**Calculating the IHD of the reactant:**\nBy summing the contributions from each part of the structure:\nIHD (reactant) = 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C in ring) + 1 (C=O in acid) + 1 (C=O in formyl) + 1 (C=C in vinyl) = 5.\n\nSo, the index of hydrogen deficiency of the starting material is 5.\n\n### **2. Understand the Reaction**\n\nThe reagent used is **red phosphorus (Red P) and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI)**. This combination is a very powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. Its key function is to perform a complete reduction of a wide range of functional groups to the corresponding alkane. Specifically:\n\n*   It reduces aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) to methyl groups (-CH3).\n*   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to carbon-carbon single bonds (C-C).\n*   Essentially, it removes all pi bonds and most heteroatoms (like oxygen), converting the molecule into a saturated hydrocarbon.\n*   Importantly, this reaction does not break stable ring structures.\n\n### **3. Determine the Structure and IHD of the Product**\n\nThe reaction will act on all the functional groups and double bonds present in the reactant:\n\n1.  The **C=C double bond** in the cyclohexene ring will be reduced to a C-C single bond. This removes 1 unit of IHD.\n2.  The **C=O double bond** in the carboxylic acid group will be reduced. This removes 1 unit of IHD.\n3.  The **C=O double bond** in the formyl group will be reduced. This removes 1 unit of IHD.\n4.  The **C=C double bond** in the vinyl group will be reduced to a C-C single bond. This removes 1 unit of IHD.\n\nThe **ring structure** itself will remain intact.\n\n**Calculating the IHD of the product:**\nThe original IHD was 5. The reaction removes the four pi bonds, so it reduces the IHD by 4.\n\nIHD (product) = IHD (reactant) - IHD (removed by reaction)\nIHD (product) = 5 - 4 = 1\n\nThe resulting molecule is a saturated cycloalkane (specifically, a substituted cyclohexane). A saturated monocyclic compound always has an IHD of 1, which corresponds to the presence of the single ring.\n\n### **4. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe reaction reduces all double bonds (both C=C and C=O) in the starting material but leaves the ring structure intact. The four pi bonds are eliminated, reducing the IHD from 5 to 1. The remaining IHD of 1 is due to the cyclohexane ring in the product.\n\nTherefore, the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\nThe correct option is B.\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\n*   **Step 1: Analyze the Reactant**\n    The reactant is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's break down its structure to determine its components that contribute to the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation. The IHD represents the number of rings and/or pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n\n    *   **Cyclohex-3-ene:** This indicates a six-membered ring containing one carbon-carbon double bond. A ring counts as one degree of unsaturation, and a double bond counts as another. So, this part contributes 1 (for the ring) + 1 (for the C=C bond) = 2 to the IHD.\n    *   **Carboxylic acid (-COOH):** This functional group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This contributes 1 to the IHD.\n    *   **Formyl (-CHO):** This functional group (an aldehyde) also contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This contributes 1 to the IHD.\n    *   **Vinyl (-CH=CH2):** This group contains a carbon-carbon double bond. This contributes 1 to the IHD.\n\n    Summing these up, the total IHD of the reactant is:\n    IHD_reactant = 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C in ring) + 1 (C=O in acid) + 1 (C=O in formyl) + 1 (C=C in vinyl) = 5.\n\n    Alternatively, we can determine the molecular formula and calculate the IHD.\n    - Carbons: 6 (ring) + 1 (acid) + 1 (formyl) + 2 (vinyl) = 10 C\n    - Oxygens: 2 (acid) + 1 (formyl) = 3 O\n    - Hydrogens: The formula for a C10 acyclic alkane is C10H22. The IHD is the number of pairs of hydrogens missing compared to this.\n    Let's draw the structure and count hydrogens: C10H12O3.\n    IHD = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1 = 10 - 12/2 + 0/2 + 1 = 10 - 6 + 1 = 5.\n    This confirms the IHD of the starting material is 5.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the Reaction**\n    The reagent used is red phosphorus with an excess of hydroiodic acid (Red P + HI). This is a powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. Its effect is to reduce various functional groups to alkanes. Specifically:\n    *   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n    *   It reduces carbon-oxygen double bonds (C=O) in aldehydes and carboxylic acids completely to methylene (-CH2-) or methyl (-CH3) groups.\n    *   The reaction is strong enough to remove all oxygen atoms from the molecule.\n    *   Importantly, this reaction does not break open saturated rings.\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the Product and its IHD**\n    The reaction will cause the following changes to the reactant's structure:\n    1.  The C=C double bond in the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a single bond. This removes 1 degree of unsaturation.\n    2.  The C=C double bond in the vinyl group is reduced to a single bond. This removes 1 degree of unsaturation.\n    3.  The C=O double bond in the formyl group is reduced. This removes 1 degree of unsaturation.\n    4.  The C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group is reduced. This removes 1 degree of unsaturation.\n\n    The ring structure itself remains intact. Therefore, the only component contributing to the IHD in the final product is the cyclohexane ring.\n\n    The change in IHD can be calculated as:\n    IHD_product = IHD_reactant - (number of π bonds reduced)\n    IHD_product = 5 - 4 = 1.\n\n    The final product is a substituted cyclohexane. Any saturated monocyclic alkane (like cyclohexane and its derivatives) has an IHD of 1, which accounts for the ring. Since there are no double or triple bonds left in the product, its IHD is exactly 1.\n\n*   **Step 4: Conclusion**\n    The product obtained from the reaction has an Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of 1.\n\nFinal check using the molecular formula of the product:\nThe reactant is C10H12O3. The reaction removes all 3 oxygen atoms and saturates all 4 pi bonds. The product will be a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon with 10 carbon atoms. The general formula for a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon is CnH2n. Therefore, the product's formula is C10H20.\nIHD_product = C - H/2 + 1 = 10 - 20/2 + 1 = 10 - 10 + 1 = 1.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\n**1.

A saturated, monocyclic hydrocarbon has the general formula CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   The total number of carbons is 10 (6 in the ring + 1 from the first methyl + 1 from the second methyl + 2 from the ethyl). So, n=10.\n    *   The molecular formula is **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, indicates the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. It can be calculated from the molecular formula.\n\n*   **Formula:** IHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\n    (Note: Halogens are treated like H, Nitrogens add to the count, and Oxygens are ignored).\n*   **Calculation for the product (C₁₀H₂₀):**\n    *   C = 10\n    *   H = 20\n    *   IHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2)\n    *   IHD = 11 - 10\n    *   IHD = 1\n\nAlternatively, we can determine the IHD by inspecting the final structure:\n*   1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane has:\n    *   Number of rings = 1\n    *   Number of double bonds = 0\n    *   Number of triple bonds = 0\n*   IHD = (number of rings) + (number of double bonds) + 2*(number of triple bonds)\n*   IHD = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the final product is 1.

Let's break down its structure to understand the functional groups and unsaturations present.\n    *   **Core structure:** A six-membered ring (cyclohexane derivative).\n    *   **Unsaturations:**\n        *   `cyclohex-3-ene`: A carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) within the ring.\n        *   `5-vinyl`: A vinyl group (-CH=CH2) attached to the ring, which contains another C=C double bond.\n        *   `2-formyl`: An aldehyde group (-CHO) which contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n        *   `carboxylic acid`: A carboxyl group (-COOH) which contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n    *   **Rings:** There is one ring in the molecule.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction:**\n    The reagent is red phosphorus and excess of hydroiodic acid (Red P + excess HI). This is a very strong reducing agent. Its primary function is to completely reduce a wide range of functional groups to their corresponding alkanes.

The product will also have 10 carbon atoms, arranged as a substituted cyclohexane. The specific name would be a derivative of ethyl-dimethylcyclohexane, but we don't need the exact name to find the IHD.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product:**\n    The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, is calculated by the formula:\n    IHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds)\n\n    Let's analyze the structure of the product:\n    *   **Number of rings:** The original six-membered ring is not broken during the reaction. So, the product has 1 ring.\n    *   **Number of π bonds:** The reaction with Red P + HI reduces all C=C and C=O double bonds to single bonds. Therefore, the product has 0 π bonds.\n\n    Plugging these values into the formula:\n    IHD = 1 (for the ring) + 0 (for π bonds) = 1\n\n    Alternatively, we can find the molecular formula of the product.

Determine the Structure and Molecular Formula of the Reactant\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down the name to determine its structure:\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: A six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbon 3 and carbon 4.\n*   **carboxylic acid**: A -COOH group is present. By convention, this is at position C1.\n*   **2-formyl**: An aldehyde group (-CHO) is attached to C2.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A vinyl group (-CH=CH2) is attached to C5.\n\nThe structure is as follows:\n```\n      (COOH)\n        |\n    H - C1 --- C2 - H - (CHO)\n        |      |\n   H2 - C6     C3 - H\n        |      ||\n    H - C5     C4 - H\n        |\n      (-CH=CH2)\n```\n\nNow, let's determine the molecular formula by counting the atoms:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 in the ring + 1 in COOH + 1 in CHO + 2 in the vinyl group = **10 carbons (C10)**.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):**\n    *   On the ring: 1(at C1) + 1(at C2) + 1(at C3) + 1(at C4) + 1(at C5) + 2(at C6) = 7 H\n    *   In the functional groups: 1(in COOH) + 1(in CHO) + 3(in vinyl, -CH=CH2) = 5 H\n    *   Total H = 7 + 5 = **12 hydrogens (H12)**.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 in COOH + 1 in CHO = **3 oxygens (O3)**.\n\nSo, the molecular formula of the reactant is **C10H12O3**.\n\n*As an aside, we can calculate the IHD of the reactant for confirmation:\nIHD = C + 1 - H/2 = 10 + 1 - 12/2 = 11 - 6 = 5.\nThis corresponds to 1 ring, 1 C=C in the ring, 1 C=C in the vinyl group, 1 C=O in the carboxyl group, and 1 C=O in the formyl group (1+1+1+1+1 = 5).*\n\n### 2.

The final product is a substituted cyclohexane. The exact name would be an isomer of ethyl-dimethylcyclohexane, but what matters is its molecular formula.\n\nLet's determine the molecular formula of the product:\n*   **Carbon (C):** The number of carbon atoms does not change. So, it remains **10 (C10)**.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** The product is a fully saturated monocyclic alkane (a substituted cyclohexane). The general formula for such a compound is **CnH2n**. For n=10, the formula is **C10H20**.\n\nSo, the molecular formula of the product is **C10H20**.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, can be calculated using the molecular formula.

It is known for the complete reduction of almost all oxygen-containing functional groups and unsaturations (double/triple bonds) to their corresponding saturated alkane forms.\n    *   Carboxylic acid (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   Aldehyde (-CHO) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   Alkene (C=C) is reduced to an alkane (C-C).\n    *   Crucially, this reaction does not break the carbon-carbon single bonds of the skeleton, so the ring structure will remain intact.\n\n4.  **Determine the Structure and Formula of the Product:**\n    The reaction will perform the following transformations on the reactant:\n    *   The carboxylic acid group at C1 becomes a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   The formyl group at C2 becomes a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   The double bond in the cyclohexene ring is saturated (becomes a single bond).\n    *   The vinyl group (-CH=CH2) at C5 is reduced to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n\n    The resulting product is a saturated, substituted cyclohexane. Since the carbon skeleton is preserved, the product will still have 10 carbon atoms. All oxygen atoms are removed, and all double bonds are converted to single bonds by adding hydrogen. The product is a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon.\n\n    A saturated hydrocarbon with `C` carbon atoms and `R` rings has the general formula **CₙH₂ₙ₊₂₋₂R**.\n    *   In our product, the number of carbon atoms `n` = 10.\n    *   The number of rings `R` = 1 (the cyclohexane ring).\n    *   Plugging these values into the formula:\n        *   Number of Hydrogens = 2 * 10 + 2 - 2 * 1 = 20 + 2 - 2 = 20.\n\n    So, the molecular formula of the product is **C10H20**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product:**\n    The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (also known as the degree of unsaturation) represents the number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule. The formula for IHD is:\n    IHD = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\n    Where C is the number of carbons, H is hydrogens, X is halogens, and N is nitrogens.\n\n    For the product with the formula **C10H20**:\n    *   C = 10\n    *   H = 20\n    *   X = 0\n    *   N = 0\n\n    IHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2) = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\n    Alternatively, we can determine the IHD by inspecting the structure of the product. The product is a substituted cyclohexane. It contains one ring and no double or triple bonds. Each ring contributes 1 to the IHD. Therefore, the IHD is 1.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$.\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n*   **Step 1: Analyze the reactant's structure and its Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD).**\n    The reactant is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's break down its structure to understand its components and calculate its IHD.\n    *   `cyclohex`: This indicates a six-membered carbon ring. A ring contributes 1 to the IHD.\n    *   `-3-ene`: This indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) within the ring. A double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n    *   `carboxylic acid` (-COOH): This functional group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n    *   `formyl` (-CHO): This is an aldehyde group, which also contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n    *   `vinyl` (-CH=CH2): This group contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). This double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n\n    So, the total IHD of the reactant is the sum of contributions from all these features:\n    IHD(reactant) = 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C in ring) + 1 (C=O in COOH) + 1 (C=O in CHO) + 1 (C=C in vinyl) = 5.\n    This corresponds to option A, but the question asks for the IHD of the *product*.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the reaction and the effect of the reagents.**\n    The reactant is treated with red phosphorus and an excess of HI (Red P + HI). This combination is a very strong reducing agent. Its primary function is to carry out the complete reduction of oxygen-containing functional groups and any carbon-carbon multiple bonds.\n    *   It reduces aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) completely to the corresponding alkane parts (i.e., -CH3 groups).\n    *   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n    *   Essentially, it removes all oxygen atoms and saturates all pi bonds.\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the structure of the product.**\n    Applying the effects of Red P + HI to our reactant:\n    *   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring will be reduced to a `cyclohexane` ring (the C=C becomes C-C). The ring structure itself remains.\n    *   The `carboxylic acid` group will be reduced to a methyl (-CH3) group.\n    *   The `formyl` group will be reduced to a methyl (-CH3) group.\n    *   The `vinyl` group (-CH=CH2) will be reduced to an ethyl (-CH2-CH3) group.\n\n    The final product will be a saturated substituted cyclohexane. All the double bonds (both C=C and C=O) will be gone. The only feature contributing to the IHD will be the cyclohexane ring itself.\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product.**\n    The IHD is defined as the sum of the number of rings and the number of pi bonds in a molecule.\n    *   Number of rings in the product = 1 (the cyclohexane ring).\n    *   Number of pi bonds in the product = 0 (all double and triple bonds have been reduced to single bonds).\n\n    Therefore, the IHD of the product is:\n    IHD(product) = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\n    Alternatively, we can determine the molecular formula. The reactant has a carbon skeleton of C10 (6 in the ring, 1 in COOH, 1 in CHO, 2 in vinyl). The product, being a saturated monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane), will have the general formula CnH2n. Since n=10, the formula is C10H20.\n    Using the IHD formula: IHD = C + 1 - H/2 = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\nBoth methods confirm that the IHD of the final product is 1.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 5\nB) 0\nC) 1\nD) 3\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThe user wants to find the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product of a specific chemical reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reactant**\nThe reactant is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's break down its structure to identify all sources of unsaturation:\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: This is a six-membered ring with one double bond.\n    *   The ring itself contributes 1 to the IHD.\n    *   The double bond (C=C) within the ring contributes another 1 to the IHD.\n*   **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**: This group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n    *   This C=O double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **formyl (-CHO)**: This is an aldehyde group, which also contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n    *   This C=O double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **vinyl (-CH=CH2)**: This group contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n    *   This C=C double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n\nSumming these up, the IHD of the starting material (reactant) is 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C in ring) + 1 (C=O in acid) + 1 (C=O in formyl) + 1 (C=C in vinyl) = 5.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction**\nThe reagents are red phosphorus (Red P) and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. It performs a complete reduction on the following functional groups:\n*   It reduces aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) all the way down to methyl groups (-CH3).\n*   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n*   It reduces carbon-oxygen double bonds (C=O) to methylene groups (-CH2-).\n\nIn essence, this reaction will remove all oxygen atoms and saturate all multiple bonds.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Product and its IHD**\nApplying the effects of the reaction to our reactant:\n*   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring (the C=C bond is reduced).\n*   The `carboxylic acid` group becomes a `methyl` group.\n*   The `formyl` group becomes a `methyl` group.\n*   The `vinyl` group becomes an `ethyl` group (-CH2-CH3).\n\nThe final product is a fully saturated substituted cyclohexane. Let's calculate its IHD:\n*   **Rings**: The product still contains the six-membered ring. This contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **Multiple Bonds**: All C=C and C=O double bonds have been reduced to single bonds. There are no multiple bonds left. This contributes 0 to the IHD.\n\nTherefore, the total IHD of the product is 1 (for the ring) + 0 (for multiple bonds) = 1.\n\nThe correct answer is 1. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\n### **1.

A `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH). By IUPAC convention, the carbon of the ring attached to this primary functional group is C1.\n    2.  A `formyl` group (-CHO, an aldehyde) at position C2.\n    3.  A `vinyl` group (-CH=CH2) at position C5.\n    4.  A carbon-carbon double bond (`C=C`) within the ring between C3 and C4.\n\nTo understand the transformation, we need to identify all the features that can be reduced. These are:\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which contains a C=O double bond.\n*   The formyl group (-CHO), which contains a C=O double bond.\n*   The vinyl group (-CH=CH2), which contains a C=C double bond.\n*   The double bond within the cyclohexene ring.\n\nThe molecule also has one ring.\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, for the reactant can be calculated by summing the number of rings and pi (π) bonds:\n*   1 ring\n*   1 π bond in the cyclohexene ring (C=C)\n*   1 π bond in the vinyl group (C=C)\n*   1 π bond in the carboxylic acid group (C=O)\n*   1 π bond in the formyl group (C=O)\n*   **Total IHD of reactant = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5**\n\n### **2.

It has no double bonds, and all oxygen atoms have been removed. The carbon skeleton is preserved.\n\n*   **Carbon Count:** The number of carbon atoms does not change during this reduction. We can count them in the reactant: 6 (ring) + 1 (COOH) + 1 (CHO) + 2 (vinyl) = 10 carbon atoms. So, the product has 10 carbon atoms.\n*   **Structure:** The product is a monocyclic (one ring) alkane.\n*   **General Formula:** The general formula for a saturated monocyclic alkane is **CnH2n**.\n*   **Molecular Formula of Product:** Since n = 10, the molecular formula of the product is **C10H20**.\n\n### **4.

By convention, this is at position 1.\n*   **2-formyl**: An aldehyde group (-CHO) is attached to carbon 2.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A vinyl group (-CH=CH2) is attached to carbon 5.\n\nLet's visualize the structure and identify the sources of unsaturation. The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, is calculated as the sum of the number of rings and the number of pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n\nFor the reactant:\n1.  **One ring** (the cyclohexene ring) contributes 1 to the IHD.\n2.  **One C=C double bond** within the ring contributes 1 to the IHD.\n3.  **One C=O double bond** in the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) contributes 1 to the IHD.\n4.  **One C=O double bond** in the formyl group (-CHO) contributes 1 to the IHD.\n5.  **One C=C double bond** in the vinyl group (-CH=CH2) contributes 1 to the IHD.\n\nSumming these up, the IHD of the reactant is 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C) + 1 (C=O) + 1 (C=O) + 1 (C=C) = **5**.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Reaction**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus (Red P) and an excess of HI (hydroiodic acid)**. This combination is a very powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. Its key functions are:\n\n*   It reduces aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) completely to the corresponding alkyl groups (-CH3).\n*   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n*   It does not typically break stable carbon-carbon single bonds, such as those in a cyclohexane ring.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Structure of the Product**\n\nThe reaction will reduce all the functional groups and double bonds in the starting molecule, leaving a fully saturated hydrocarbon skeleton.\n\n*   The **cyclohexene ring** will be reduced to a **cyclohexane ring** (the C=C becomes C-C).\n*   The **carboxylic acid group** at position 1 will be reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH3).\n*   The **formyl group** at position 2 will be reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH3).\n*   The **vinyl group** at position 5 will be reduced to an **ethyl group** (-CH2CH3).\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane, which is a saturated molecule. It contains no double or triple bonds.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nNow, we calculate the IHD for the final product.\n\nUsing the definition IHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds):\n*   **Number of rings**: The product still contains the six-membered cyclohexane ring. So, the number of rings is 1.\n*   **Number of π bonds**: All the double bonds (C=C and C=O) from the reactant have been reduced to single bonds. The product is fully saturated. So, the number of π bonds is 0.\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the product = 1 (ring) + 0 (π bonds) = **1**.\n\n**Alternative Method: Using Molecular Formula**\n\n1.  **Reactant Formula:** Let's find the molecular formula of the reactant (C10H12O3) to determine the number of carbons.\n    *   Ring: C6\n    *   -COOH: C1\n    *   -CHO: C1\n    *   -CH=CH2: C2\n    *   Total Carbons = 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10.\n2.  **Product Formula:** The reaction removes all oxygens and adds hydrogens to saturate the molecule, but the number of carbons remains the same (C=10). The product is a substituted cyclohexane. The general formula for a monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane) is CnH2n. For C=10, the formula is **C10H20**.\n3.  **IHD Calculation:** The formula for IHD is IHD = (2C + 2 - H)/2.\n    *   IHD = (2 * 10 + 2 - 20) / 2\n    *   IHD = (22 - 20) / 2\n    *   IHD = 2 / 2 = **1**.\n\nBoth methods confirm that the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\n*   **Step 1: Analyze the reactant molecule.**\n    The reactant is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n    Let's first determine its structure and molecular formula.\n    *   `cyclohex-3-ene`: A 6-membered carbon ring with one double bond between carbons 3 and 4.\n    *   `carboxylic acid`: A -COOH group, which we'll place at position 1 by convention.\n    *   `2-formyl`: An aldehyde group (-CHO) at position 2.\n    *   `5-vinyl`: An ethylene group (-CH=CH2) at position 5.\n\n    Now, let's determine the molecular formula by counting the atoms:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 in the ring + 1 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO + 2 in -CH=CH2 = 10 carbons.\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** Let's count them on the structure.\n        *   C1: 1H\n        *   C2: 1H\n        *   C3: 1H\n        *   C4: 1H\n        *   C5: 1H\n        *   C6: 2H\n        *   -COOH: 1H\n        *   -CHO: 1H\n        *   -CH=CH2: 3H\n        *   Total H = 1+1+1+1+1+2+1+1+3 = 12 hydrogens.\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO = 3 oxygens.\n    *   The molecular formula of the reactant is **C10H12O3**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Understand the reaction.**\n    The reagent is red phosphorus (Red P) with an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. Its effect is as follows:\n    *   It reduces carbonyl groups (like in aldehydes -CHO and carboxylic acids -COOH) completely to the corresponding alkane (CH3 group in this case).\n    *   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n    *   Essentially, it removes all oxygen atoms and saturates all pi bonds.\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the structure and formula of the product.**\n    We apply the effects of Red P/HI to our reactant:\n    *   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring (the C=C bond is reduced).\n    *   The `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) is reduced to a `methyl` group (-CH3).\n    *   The `formyl` group (-CHO) is reduced to a `methyl` group (-CH3).\n    *   The `vinyl` group (-CH=CH2) is reduced to an `ethyl` group (-CH2CH3).\n\n    The product is a saturated hydrocarbon with one ring. Specifically, it's an isomer of ethyl-dimethyl-cyclohexane.\n    Since the carbon skeleton is preserved, the product still has 10 carbon atoms.\n    The product is a saturated cycloalkane. The general formula for a saturated hydrocarbon with one ring is CnH2n.\n    Since our product has 10 carbons (n=10), its molecular formula must be C10H(2*10) = **C10H20**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product.**\n    The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, tells us the sum of the number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule. The formula is:\n    IHD = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1\n    Where C is the number of carbons, H is the number of hydrogens, and N is the number of nitrogens.\n\n    For our product with the formula C10H20:\n    *   C = 10\n    *   H = 20\n    *   N = 0\n    IHD = 10 - (20/2) + 0 + 1\n    IHD = 10 - 10 + 1\n    IHD = 1\n\n    Alternatively, we can find the IHD by inspecting the final structure.

This is a six-membered carbon ring with one double bond. This structure contributes an IHD of 1 (for the ring) + 1 (for the double bond) = 2.\n2.  **Substituents:**\n    *   **Carboxylic acid (-COOH)** at position 1. This group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), which adds 1 to the IHD.\n    *   **Formyl group (-CHO)** at position 2. This group is an aldehyde and contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), which adds 1 to the IHD.\n    *   **Vinyl group (-CH=CH2)** at position 5. This group contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), which adds 1 to the IHD.\n\n3.  **Total IHD of the Starting Material:**\n    *   IHD = (from ring) + (from C=C in ring) + (from C=O in COOH) + (from C=O in CHO) + (from C=C in vinyl)\n    *   IHD = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5\n\nTo confirm, let's determine the molecular formula of the starting material.\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 in the ring + 1 in COOH + 1 in CHO + 2 in vinyl = 10 carbons.\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** A detailed count gives H=12. (C1-H, C2-H, C3-H, C4-H, C5-H, C6-2H, COOH-H, CHO-H, Vinyl-3H = 1+1+1+1+1+2+1+1+3 = 12 hydrogens).\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 in COOH + 1 in CHO = 3 oxygens.\n*   The molecular formula is **C10H12O3**.\n*   Using the IHD formula: IHD = C - H/2 + 1 = 10 - 12/2 + 1 = 10 - 6 + 1 = 5. This matches our structural analysis.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Reaction\nThe reagent is **red phosphorus (Red P) and excess hydriodic acid (HI)**. This combination is a powerful reducing agent. Its effect on the functional groups present in the starting material is as follows:\n\n*   It reduces carboxylic acids (-COOH) completely to methyl groups (-CH3).\n*   It reduces aldehydes (-CHO) completely to methyl groups (-CH3).\n*   It reduces alkenes (C=C double bonds) to alkanes (C-C single bonds).\n\nIn this reaction, all double bonds (both C=C and C=O) will be saturated with hydrogen, and all oxygen atoms will be removed.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Structure and Formula of the Product\nThe reaction transforms the starting material:\n\n*   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring is reduced to a `cyclohexane` ring.\n*   The `-COOH` group at C1 is reduced to a `-CH3` group.\n*   The `-CHO` group at C2 is reduced to a `-CH3` group.\n*   The `-CH=CH2` group at C5 is reduced to an ethyl group `(-CH2-CH3)`.\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane (specifically, 1-ethyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohexane, though the exact isomerism doesn't affect the molecular formula). The product is a **saturated monocyclic alkane**.\n\n1.  **Carbon Atoms (C):** The number of carbon atoms does not change during the reduction. The product still has **10 carbons**.\n2.  **Hydrogen Atoms (H):** The general formula for a saturated monocyclic alkane is CnH2n. Since our product has 10 carbon atoms, its formula is C10H(2*10) = **C10H20**.\n3.  **Oxygen Atoms (O):** All oxygens are removed.\n\nThe molecular formula of the product is **C10H20**.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, can be calculated using the molecular formula. The formula is:\n\nIHD = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1\n\nFor a hydrocarbon (containing only C and H), this simplifies to:\n\nIHD = C - H/2 + 1\n\nPlugging in the values for the product (C=10, H=20):\n\nIHD = 10 - 20/2 + 1\nIHD = 10 - 10 + 1\nIHD = 1\n\nAlternatively, we can reason from the structure.

For n=10, the formula is **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n*   **Oxygens (O):** All oxygen atoms are removed during the reduction.\n*   **Product Molecular Formula:** C₁₀H₂₀.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product\nThe IHD represents the number of rings and/or π bonds in a molecule.\n\n**Method 1: Using the product structure**\n*   The product, 5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane, has one ring (the cyclohexane ring).\n*   It has no double or triple bonds (no π bonds).\n*   Therefore, IHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n**Method 2: Using the product's molecular formula (C₁₀H₂₀)**\n*   IHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\n*   IHD = 10 + 1 - (20/2)\n*   IHD = 11 - 10 = **1**.\n\nBoth methods confirm that the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1. This single degree of unsaturation corresponds to the presence of the cyclohexane ring.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 1\nB) 0\nC) 5\nD) 3\n\nThe calculated IHD is 1, which matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\n*   **Step 1: Determine the structure and molecular formula of the reactant.**\n    The reactant is \"2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid\".\n    *   The base structure is `cyclohex-3-ene`, a six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbon-3 and carbon-4.\n    *   The primary functional group is `carboxylic acid` (-COOH), which is placed at position C1.\n    *   At position C2, there is a `formyl` group (-CHO).\n    *   At position C5, there is a `vinyl` group (-CH=CH2).\n\n    Now, let's determine its molecular formula (CxHyOz) by counting the atoms:\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 in the ring + 1 in the -COOH group + 1 in the -CHO group + 2 in the vinyl group = **10 carbons (C10)**.\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** We count the hydrogens on each carbon and in the functional groups. The structure is C10H12O3.\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 in the -COOH group + 1 in the -CHO group = **3 oxygens (O3)**.\n    So, the molecular formula of the reactant is **C10H12O3**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Understand the reaction.**\n    The reactant is treated with red phosphorus and an excess of hydroiodic acid (Red P + excess HI). This is a very powerful reducing agent used in organic chemistry. It performs the following reductions:\n    *   It completely reduces aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) to their corresponding alkane groups (in this case, methyl groups, -CH3).\n    *   It reduces (saturates) carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n    *   The carbon skeleton, including the ring, remains intact.\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the structure and molecular formula of the product.**\n    The reduction process transforms the reactant as follows:\n    *   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring (the double bond is saturated).\n    *   The `carboxylic acid` group at C1 is reduced to a `methyl` group (-CH3).\n    *   The `formyl` group at C2 is reduced to a `methyl` group (-CH3).\n    *   The `vinyl` group (-CH=CH2) at C5 is reduced to an `ethyl` group (-CH2-CH3).\n\n    The resulting product is 1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane. The number of carbon atoms remains the same (C10). Since the product is now a fully saturated cycloalkane (containing only single bonds within a single ring), its general formula is CnH2n.\n    Therefore, the molecular formula of the product is **C10H20**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product.**\n    The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (also known as the degree of unsaturation) for a molecule with the formula CxHyOz is calculated as:\n    IHD = C - (H/2) + 1\n\n    For our product with the formula C10H20:\n    IHD = 10 - (20 / 2) + 1\n    IHD = 10 - 10 + 1\n    IHD = 1\n\n    The IHD of 1 is due to the presence of the single ring structure (the cyclohexane ring). All the pi bonds (from C=C and C=O) have been eliminated by the reduction.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactant Structure**\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down the name to understand its structure and calculate its initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD). The IHD (also known as the degree of unsaturation) is calculated as the sum of the number of rings and the number of pi (π) bonds in the molecule.\n\n*   **`cyclohex`**: This indicates a six-membered ring. (Contribution to IHD = 1)\n*   **`-3-ene`**: This indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) within the ring. (Contribution to IHD = 1)\n*   **`carboxylic acid` (-COOH)**: This functional group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). (Contribution to IHD = 1)\n*   **`formyl` (-CHO)**: This functional group (an aldehyde) also contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). (Contribution to IHD = 1)\n*   **`vinyl` (-CH=CH2)**: This substituent contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). (Contribution to IHD = 1)\n\nSo, the total IHD of the reactant is the sum of all these contributions:\nIHD (reactant) = 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C in ring) + 1 (C=O in acid) + 1 (C=O in formyl) + 1 (C=C in vinyl) = **5**.\n\nAlternatively, we can determine the molecular formula and calculate the IHD from it.\nThe structure is a C6 ring, a COOH group (1C), a CHO group (1C), and a vinyl group (2C). Total carbons = 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10 carbons.\nLet's find the number of hydrogens. The molecular formula is C10H12O3.\nThe IHD formula is: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 11 - 6 = **5**.\nBoth methods yield an IHD of 5 for the reactant.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\nThe reagent used is **red phosphorus with an excess of hydroiodic acid (Red P + HI)**. This is a very powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. Its key characteristics are:\n*   It reduces carbonyl groups (from aldehydes, ketones, and carboxylic acids) completely to alkanes (CH2 or CH3 groups).\n*   It reduces carbon-carbon double and triple bonds to single bonds (alkanes).\n*   It reduces alcohols to alkanes.\n*   Crucially, it does **not** break open stable aliphatic rings like cyclohexane.\n\n**3. Determine the Product Structure and its IHD**\n\nThe reaction will proceed as follows:\n*   The C=C double bond in the `cyclohexene` ring will be reduced to a C-C single bond.\n*   The C=C double bond in the `vinyl` group will be reduced to a C-C single bond.\n*   The C=O double bond in the `carboxylic acid` group will be completely reduced.\n*   The C=O double bond in the `formyl` group will be completely reduced.\n\nEssentially, all pi bonds in the molecule are removed by the reduction. The carbon skeleton, including the six-membered ring, remains intact.\n\nThe product will be a **saturated substituted cyclohexane**.\n*   The number of rings in the product is 1 (the cyclohexane ring).\n*   The number of pi bonds in the product is 0 (since all double bonds were reduced).\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the product is:\nIHD (product) = (number of rings) + (number of pi bonds)\nIHD (product) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe reaction with Red P / HI reduces all double bonds (both C=C and C=O) in the starting material but leaves the ring structure intact. The initial molecule has an IHD of 5 (1 from the ring, 4 from various double bonds). The reaction removes all 4 double bonds, thus reducing the IHD by 4.\n\nFinal IHD = Initial IHD - (Number of pi bonds reduced)\nFinal IHD = 5 - 4 = 1.\n\nThe resulting molecule is a substituted cyclohexane, which has one ring and no double bonds, giving it an index of hydrogen deficiency of 1.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the final product.\n\n**1.

Let's break down its structure to understand its properties and calculate its initial IHD.\n\n*   **Parent Structure:** `cyclohex-3-ene`. This is a six-membered carbon ring with one carbon-carbon double bond. A ring itself counts as one degree of unsaturation, and the double bond adds another.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   `carboxylic acid` (-COOH): This group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n    *   `2-formyl` (-CHO): This is an aldehyde group, which also contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n    *   `5-vinyl` (-CH=CH2): This group contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n\nLet's calculate the initial IHD (also known as degrees of unsaturation) for the reactant:\n*   1 from the ring structure.\n*   1 from the C=C bond within the ring.\n*   1 from the C=C bond in the vinyl group.\n*   1 from the C=O bond in the formyl group.\n*   1 from the C=O bond in the carboxylic acid group.\n\nTotal IHD of the reactant = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n\nTo find the molecular formula, let's count the atoms:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 in the ring + 1 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO + 2 in -CH=CH2 = 10 carbons.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** A systematic count reveals 12 hydrogens (C10H12O3).\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO = 3 oxygens.\nThe molecular formula of the reactant is C10H12O3.\nChecking IHD with the formula: IHD = C + 1 - H/2 = 10 + 1 - 12/2 = 11 - 6 = 5. This confirms our structural analysis.\n\n**2. Identify the Reaction and Predict the Product**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess of HI** (hydroiodic acid). This combination is a very powerful and exhaustive reducing agent in organic chemistry. Its effect is to:\n\n*   Reduce all oxygen-containing functional groups (alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids) completely to the corresponding alkanes (i.e., replacing C=O and C-O bonds with C-H bonds).\n*   Reduce (saturate) all carbon-carbon double bonds and triple bonds to single bonds.\n\nApplying this to our reactant:\n*   The `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The `formyl` group (-CHO) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The `vinyl` group (-CH=CH2) will be reduced to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n*   The `C=C double bond` inside the cyclohexene ring will be reduced to a C-C single bond, converting the cyclohexene ring into a cyclohexane ring.\n\nThe carbon skeleton is preserved. The starting molecule has 10 carbon atoms, and the product will also have 10 carbon atoms. All multiple bonds and oxygen atoms will be removed, resulting in a fully saturated hydrocarbon that retains the original ring structure.\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane. Specifically, it is 4-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane (the exact name is not necessary, but the structure is a cyclohexane ring with two methyl and one ethyl group).\n\n**3. Determine the Molecular Formula and IHD of the Product**\n\nThe product is a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon. The general formula for such a compound is **CnH2n**.\nSince our product has 10 carbon atoms (n=10), its molecular formula is **C10H20**.\n\nNow, let's calculate the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) for the product, C10H20.\n\n**Method 1: Using the IHD Formula**\nThe formula for IHD for a hydrocarbon is:\nIHD = C - H/2 + 1\nIHD = 10 - (20 / 2) + 1\nIHD = 10 - 10 + 1\nIHD = 1\n\n**Method 2: Using the Structure**\nThe IHD is the sum of rings and multiple bonds.\n*   Number of rings = 1 (the cyclohexane ring).\n*   Number of double bonds = 0.\n*   Number of triple bonds = 0.\n\nIHD = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1.\n\nBoth methods yield an IHD of 1.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained from the reaction is 1.

Let's break down its structure:\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: This is a six-membered carbon ring with one double bond between carbon 3 and carbon 4.\n*   **carboxylic acid**: A -COOH group is attached to the ring. By IUPAC convention for carboxylic acids, this carbon is C1.\n*   **2-formyl**: A formyl group (-CHO, an aldehyde) is attached to C2.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A vinyl group (-CH=CH2) is attached to C5.\n\nLet's determine the molecular formula of this reactant:\n*   **Carbon (C)**:\n    *   6 carbons in the ring.\n    *   1 carbon in the -COOH group.\n    *   1 carbon in the -CHO group.\n    *   2 carbons in the -CH=CH2 group.\n    *   Total Carbon atoms = 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10.\n*   **Hydrogen (H)**:\n    *   Let's count the hydrogens on each carbon of the ring:\n        *   C1 (bonded to COOH, C2, C6): 1H\n        *   C2 (bonded to CHO, C1, C3): 1H\n        *   C3 (double bond to C4, single bond to C2): 1H\n        *   C4 (double bond to C3, single bond to C5): 1H\n        *   C5 (bonded to vinyl, C4, C6): 1H\n        *   C6 (bonded to C1, C5): 2H\n    *   Hydrogens on the substituent groups:\n        *   -COOH: 1H\n        *   -CHO: 1H\n        *   -CH=CH2: 3H\n    *   Total Hydrogen atoms = (1+1+1+1+1+2) + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12.\n*   **Oxygen (O)**:\n    *   2 oxygens in the -COOH group.\n    *   1 oxygen in the -CHO group.\n    *   Total Oxygen atoms = 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nSo, the molecular formula of the reactant is **C10H12O3**.\n\n**2.

Since the starting material has 10 carbon atoms, the product will also have 10 carbon atoms. It will be a derivative of cyclohexane, meaning it is a monocyclic alkane (a single ring, no double or triple bonds).\n\n**4.

Determine the Molecular Formula of the Reactant:**\n*   The parent structure is `cyclohex-3-ene`: a 6-carbon ring with one double bond.\n*   Substituents are:\n    *   `carboxylic acid` (-COOH): adds 1 C, 1 H, and 2 O.\n    *   `formyl` group (-CHO): adds 1 C, 1 H, and 1 O.\n    *   `vinyl` group (-CH=CH₂): adds 2 C and 3 H.\n*   Let's count the atoms:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (in the ring) + 1 (in -COOH) + 1 (in -CHO) + 2 (in -CH=CH₂) = 10 carbons.\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (in -COOH) + 1 (in -CHO) = 3 oxygens.\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** A saturated 6-membered ring would have 12 hydrogens (C₆H₁₂).

Therefore, the IHD is 1.\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the final product is 1.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the structure of the reactant\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down its structure based on the name:\n*   **cyclohex-**: The molecule has a six-membered carbon ring.\n*   **-carboxylic acid**: There is a principal functional group, -COOH, attached to the ring. By IUPAC convention, its position is C1.\n*   **-3-ene**: There is a carbon-carbon double bond (a π-bond) in the ring between C3 and C4.\n*   **2-formyl**: An aldehyde group (-CHO) is attached to C2 of the ring. This group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (a π-bond).\n*   **5-vinyl**: A vinyl group (-CH=CH2) is attached to C5 of the ring. This group contains a carbon-carbon double bond (a π-bond).\nThe -COOH group itself also contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (a π-bond).\n\nSo, structurally, the reactant molecule contains:\n*   1 ring.\n*   4 π-bonds (one in the cyclohexene ring, one in the vinyl group, one in the formyl group, and one in the carboxylic acid group).\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the reactant is the sum of rings and π-bonds, which is 1 (ring) + 4 (π-bonds) = 5.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the chemical reaction and the transformation\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus (Red P) and excess HI**. This is a very strong reducing agent. It performs the following reductions:\n*   Reduces all carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n*   Reduces all carbonyl groups (C=O) in aldehydes and carboxylic acids completely to alkane parts (CH2 or CH3).\n*   Specifically, R-CHO is reduced to R-CH3.\n*   Specifically, R-COOH is reduced to R-CH3.\n\nIn essence, all π-bonds in the molecule are removed, and all oxygen atoms are eliminated. The carbon skeleton, including the ring, remains intact.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the structure of the product\nApplying the effects of the Red P/HI reduction to our reactant:\n*   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a saturated `cyclohexane` ring. The π-bond in the ring is gone.\n*   The `2-formyl` group (-CHO) becomes a methyl group (-CH3). The C=O π-bond is gone.\n*   The `5-vinyl` group (-CH=CH2) becomes an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The C=C π-bond is gone.\n*   The `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) becomes a methyl group (-CH3). The C=O π-bond is gone.\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane molecule. All functional groups containing π-bonds have been fully saturated. The only feature contributing to the index of hydrogen deficiency is the ring structure itself.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency is given by the formula:\nIHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π-bonds)\n\nFor the product molecule:\n*   Number of rings = 1 (the cyclohexane ring is preserved).\n*   Number of π-bonds = 0 (all double bonds were reduced).\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the product is:\nIHD = 1 + 0 = 1\n\nAlternatively, we can determine the molecular formula of the product.\n*   Reactant C atoms: 6 (ring) + 1 (COOH) + 1 (CHO) + 2 (vinyl) = 10 carbons.\n*   The reaction does not change the number of carbon atoms. So, the product has 10 carbons.\n*   The product is a substituted cyclohexane, which is a saturated monocyclic alkane. The general formula for such compounds is CnH2n.\n*   With n=10, the product's molecular formula is C10H20.\n*   Using the IHD formula for a molecular formula (C_c H_h O_o N_n X_x):\n    IHD = c - h/2 + n/2 + 1\n    IHD = 10 - 20/2 + 0/2 + 1 = 10 - 10 + 1 = 1.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\n**1. Analyze the Reactant**\n\nFirst, let's determine the structure and molecular formula of the reactant, 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: This is a six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbon-3 and carbon-4.\n*   **carboxylic acid**: A -COOH group is attached to the ring. By convention, this is at position C1.\n*   **2-formyl**: A formyl group (-CHO) is attached at position C2.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A vinyl group (-CH=CH2) is attached at position C5.\n\nLet's determine the molecular formula by counting the atoms:\n*   **Carbon (C)**:\n    *   6 carbons in the cyclohexene ring.\n    *   1 carbon in the carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   1 carbon in the formyl group (-CHO).\n    *   2 carbons in the vinyl group (-CH=CH2).\n    *   Total Carbon atoms = 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10.\n*   **Hydrogen (H)**:\n    *   H on C1: 1\n    *   H on C2: 1\n    *   H on C3: 1\n    *   H on C4: 1\n    *   H on C5: 1\n    *   H on C6: 2\n    *   H in -COOH: 1\n    *   H in -CHO: 1\n    *   H in -CH=CH2: 3\n    *   Total Hydrogen atoms = (1+1+1+1+1+2) + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12.\n*   **Oxygen (O)**:\n    *   2 oxygens in the carboxylic acid group.\n    *   1 oxygen in the formyl group.\n    *   Total Oxygen atoms = 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nSo, the molecular formula of the reactant is **C10H12O3**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\nThe reagent used is **Red Phosphorus with excess HI (Hydroiodic acid)**. This is a very powerful reducing agent combination known for its ability to carry out complete reduction. It reduces most oxygen-containing functional groups and unsaturations (double/triple bonds) to their corresponding saturated alkane form.\n\nHere's how it will affect the reactant:\n*   The **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)** at C1 will be reduced to a **methyl group (-CH3)**.\n*   The **formyl group (-CHO)** at C2 will be reduced to a **methyl group (-CH3)**.\n*   The **double bond in the cyclohexene ring (C3=C4)** will be reduced to a **single bond (C3-C4)**, making the ring a cyclohexane.\n*   The **vinyl group (-CH=CH2)** at C5 will be reduced to an **ethyl group (-CH2-CH3)**.\n\n**3. Determine the Product**\n\nBased on the reductions above, the carbon skeleton remains the same (a six-membered ring with substituents), but all functional groups and double bonds are saturated.\nThe product will be **1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane**.\n\nNow, let's find the molecular formula of the product:\n*   **Carbon (C)**: The number of carbon atoms does not change during this reduction. So, C = 10.\n*   **Hydrogen (H)**: The product is a substituted cycloalkane. A monocyclic alkane (a compound with one ring and no double or triple bonds) has the general formula **CnH2n**.\n    *   Since n = 10, the number of hydrogen atoms will be 2 * 10 = 20.\n*   **Oxygen (O)**: All oxygen atoms are removed during the reduction. So, O = 0.\n\nThe molecular formula of the product is **C10H20**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), or degree of unsaturation, tells us the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule. The formula is:\nIHD = C - (H/2) + 1 (for molecules with C, H, and O)\n\nUsing the molecular formula of the product (C10H20):\nIHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1\nIHD = 10 - 10 + 1\nIHD = 1\n\nAlternatively, we can determine the IHD by examining the structure of the product, 1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane.\n*   Number of rings = 1 (the cyclohexane ring)\n*   Number of double bonds = 0\n*   Number of triple bonds = 0\n\nIHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nBoth methods confirm that the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nThe user wants to find the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product formed from the reaction of 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid with red phosphorus and excess HI.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the reactant.**\nThe reactant is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: A six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between C3 and C4.\n*   **carboxylic acid**: A -COOH group.

This combination is a very strong reducing agent. It performs an exhaustive reduction of the molecule.\n*   It reduces all oxygen-containing functional groups to alkanes.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   The formyl group (-CHO) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   It reduces all carbon-carbon multiple bonds to single bonds.\n    *   The C=C double bond in the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a C-C single bond.\n    *   The C=C double bond in the vinyl group is reduced to a C-C single bond.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure and formula of the product.**\nThe reaction removes all the oxygen atoms and saturates all the double bonds. The original carbon skeleton, including the ring, remains intact.\n*   The C10 carbon skeleton is preserved.\n*   The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring.\n*   The formyl group (at C2) becomes a methyl group.\n*   The carboxylic acid group (at C1) becomes a methyl group.\n*   The vinyl group (at C5) becomes an ethyl group.\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane. Since all double bonds have been saturated, the only feature contributing to hydrogen deficiency is the single ring.\n\nThe product is a saturated monocyclic alkane with 10 carbon atoms.\nA non-cyclic saturated alkane with 10 carbons (decane) would have the formula CnH2n+2 = C10H22.\nSince our product has one ring, its formula will be CnH2n = **C10H20**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of the product.**\nWe can calculate the IHD of the product in two ways:\n1.  **By structure:** The product contains one ring and zero pi bonds.

O = 0.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is C10H20.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product:**\n    The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, indicates the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The formula for IHD is:\n    IHD = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1\n    (Where C is the number of carbons, H is hydrogens, and N is nitrogens.

It can be calculated using the following rule:\n\n*   IHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds)\n\n**2. Analyze the Structure of the Reactant**\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down its structure to find its IHD.\n\n*   **`cyclohex`**: This indicates the presence of one ring. (Contribution to IHD = 1)\n*   **`-3-ene`**: This indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (a pi bond) within the ring. (Contribution to IHD = 1)\n*   **`carboxylic acid`**: The -COOH group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), which is a pi bond. (Contribution to IHD = 1)\n*   **`formyl`**: The -CHO group (an aldehyde) contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), which is a pi bond. (Contribution to IHD = 1)\n*   **`vinyl`**: The -CH=CH2 group contains a carbon-carbon double bond (a pi bond). (Contribution to IHD = 1)\n\nSo, the total IHD of the reactant is the sum of these contributions:\nIHD (reactant) = 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C in ring) + 1 (C=O in acid) + 1 (C=O in aldehyde) + 1 (C=C in vinyl) = **5**\n\nAlternatively, we can determine the molecular formula of the reactant:\n*   The carbon skeleton has 6 carbons in the ring, 1 in the carboxyl group, 1 in the formyl group, and 2 in the vinyl group, for a total of C=10.\n*   Counting the hydrogens: The structure is C10H12O3.\n*   Using the IHD formula IHD = C + 1 - (H/2) = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 11 - 6 = 5. This confirms our structural analysis.\n\n**3. Understand the Reaction**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess HI (Red P + HI)**. This reagent combination is a very powerful reducing agent. Its effect is to:\n\n*   Reduce all carbon-carbon multiple bonds (C=C, C≡C) to single bonds (C-C).\n*   Reduce all oxygen-containing functional groups (like carboxylic acids, aldehydes, ketones, alcohols) completely to the corresponding alkane. For example, -COOH and -CHO are both reduced to -CH3.\n*   Crucially, this reaction **does not break open saturated rings** (cycloalkanes).\n\n**4. Determine the Structure and IHD of the Product**\n\nLet's see what happens to each part of the reactant molecule that contributes to the IHD:\n\n*   **Ring**: The cyclohexane ring remains intact. So, the product will still have one ring.\n*   **Pi Bonds**: All four pi bonds in the reactant (one C=C in the ring, one C=C in the vinyl group, one C=O in the acid, and one C=O in the aldehyde) are reduced to single bonds.\n\nTherefore, for the product molecule:\n*   Number of rings = 1\n*   Number of pi bonds = 0\n\nNow, we calculate the IHD of the product:\nIHD (product) = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**\n\nThe final product will be a substituted cyclohexane (specifically, 1-ethyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohexane, though the exact name is not needed). Its molecular formula is C10H20.\nLet's verify the IHD with the product's formula:\nIHD = C + 1 - (H/2) = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\nHere is a step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactant:**\n    The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's determine its structure and its index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD). The IHD (or degree of unsaturation) is a count of the number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n\n    *   **Structure breakdown:**\n        *   `cyclohex-3-ene`: This is a six-membered ring containing one carbon-carbon double bond. This accounts for **one ring** and **one pi bond**.\n        *   `carboxylic acid` (-COOH): This group contains one carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This accounts for **one pi bond**.\n        *   `formyl` (-CHO): This is an aldehyde group, which contains one carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This accounts for **one pi bond**.\n        *   `vinyl` (-CH=CH2): This group contains one carbon-carbon double bond. This accounts for **one pi bond**.\n\n    *   **Calculate the IHD of the reactant:**\n        Summing up the contributions:\n        IHD(reactant) = 1 (from the ring) + 1 (from C=C in ring) + 1 (from C=O in acid) + 1 (from C=O in formyl) + 1 (from C=C in vinyl) = 5.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction:**\n    The reactant is treated with red phosphorus (Red P) and an excess of hydriodic acid (HI). This combination is a very powerful and well-known reducing agent in organic chemistry.\n\n    *   **Effect of Red P + HI:** This reagent combination is capable of the complete reduction of most oxygen-containing functional groups and carbon-carbon multiple bonds.\n        *   It reduces carboxylic acids (-COOH) and aldehydes (-CHO) completely to alkyl groups (-CH3). This involves the reduction of the C=O bonds.\n        *   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n        *   It does not, under typical conditions, break open a stable cycloalkane ring.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of the Product:**\n    The reaction will reduce all the unsaturations (pi bonds) in the starting material but will leave the carbon ring intact.\n\n    *   The C=C bond in the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a C-C bond, making it a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The C=C bond in the vinyl group is reduced, converting it to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n    *   The C=O bond in the carboxylic acid is reduced, and the entire group is converted to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   The C=O bond in the formyl group is reduced, and the entire group is converted to a methyl group (-CH3).\n\n    The final product is a substituted cyclohexane. It is a saturated molecule containing one ring system.\n\n4.  **Calculate the IHD of the Product:**\n    We can determine the IHD of the product in two ways:\n\n    *   **Method 1: Change in IHD**\n        The reaction removes all four pi bonds from the reactant. The ring structure is preserved.\n        IHD(product) = IHD(reactant) - (Number of pi bonds reduced)\n        IHD(product) = 5 - 4\n        IHD(product) = 1\n        This remaining degree of unsaturation corresponds to the single ring in the product molecule.\n\n    *   **Method 2: From the Product's Molecular Formula**\n        Let's determine the molecular formula of the product. First, find the number of carbon atoms in the reactant:\n        - Cyclohexene ring: 6 C\n        - Carboxylic acid group: 1 C\n        - Formyl group: 1 C\n        - Vinyl group: 2 C\n        - Total carbons = 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10 C.\n        The reaction does not change the number of carbon atoms. The product is a saturated monocyclic alkane (a substituted cyclohexane) with 10 carbon atoms. The general formula for a monocyclic alkane is CnH2n.\n        Therefore, the molecular formula of the product is C10H(2*10) = **C10H20**.\n        Now, calculate the IHD for C10H20 using the formula IHD = C - H/2 + 1:\n        IHD = 10 - (20 / 2) + 1\n        IHD = 10 - 10 + 1\n        IHD = 1\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Both methods confirm that the index of hydrogen deficiency of the final product is 1. This corresponds to the presence of the cyclohexane ring.

This IHD of 1 is due to the single ring present in the cyclohexane structure of the product.\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\n**1. Understand the Reactant and its Structure**\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down this name to draw the structure and find its molecular formula.\n\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: This is a six-membered carbon ring with one double bond between carbon 3 and carbon 4.\n*   **carboxylic acid**: This is the principal functional group (-COOH), so its carbon is designated as C1 on the ring.\n*   **2-formyl**: An aldehyde group (-CHO) is attached to C2 of the ring.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A vinyl group (-CH=CH2) is attached to C5 of the ring.\n\nLet's determine the molecular formula of the reactant:\n*   **Carbon (C)**: 6 carbons in the ring + 1 carbon in the -COOH group + 1 carbon in the -CHO group + 2 carbons in the -CH=CH2 group = **10 carbons (C10)**.\n*   **Hydrogen (H)**:\n    *   On the ring: C1(H), C2(H), C3(H), C4(H), C5(H), C6(H2) -> 7 H\n    *   In the substituents: -COOH (1 H), -CHO (1 H), -CH=CH2 (3 H) -> 5 H\n    *   Total Hydrogen = 7 + 5 = **12 hydrogens (H12)**.\n*   **Oxygen (O)**: 2 oxygens in the -COOH group + 1 oxygen in the -CHO group = **3 oxygens (O3)**.\n\nSo, the molecular formula of the reactant is **C10H12O3**.\n\n**2. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Reactant**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, can be calculated using the formula:\nIHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\n(Note: Oxygens do not affect the IHD calculation).\n\nFor the reactant C10H12O3:\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 11 - 6 = 5.\n\nAlternatively, we can count the features that contribute to the IHD from the structure:\n*   One ring: IHD = 1\n*   One C=C double bond in the ring: IHD = 1\n*   One C=C double bond in the vinyl group: IHD = 1\n*   One C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid: IHD = 1\n*   One C=O double bond in the formyl group: IHD = 1\nTotal IHD for the reactant = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **5**. This confirms our calculation.\n\n**3. Understand the Reaction**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI (Red P + HI)**. This reagent combination is one of the most powerful reducing agents in organic chemistry. Its key function is to reduce nearly all oxygen-containing functional groups and sites of unsaturation (double/triple bonds) to their corresponding saturated alkanes.\n\n*   All C=C double bonds will be reduced to C-C single bonds.\n*   All C=O double bonds (in aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids) will be fully reduced.\n*   The overall effect is the conversion of the molecule to its corresponding saturated alkane, preserving the original carbon skeleton.\n\n**4. Determine the Product**\n\nThe reaction will cause the following changes to the reactant molecule:\n*   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring.\n*   The `-COOH` group at C1 is reduced to a `-CH3` group.\n*   The `-CHO` group at C2 is reduced to a `-CH3` group.\n*   The `-CH=CH2` group at C5 is reduced to an ethyl group (`-CH2CH3`).\n\nThe product will be a substituted cyclohexane. The number of carbon atoms remains the same (C10). All oxygen atoms are removed, and all double bonds are saturated with hydrogen. The resulting molecule is a saturated cycloalkane.\n\nThe chemical formula for a saturated alkane is CnH(2n+2). A molecule with one ring will have two fewer hydrogens, so its formula is CnH2n.\n\nSince the product has 10 carbon atoms and a single ring structure, its molecular formula will be **C10H20**.\n\n**5. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nNow we calculate the IHD for the product with the formula C10H20.\n\nUsing the IHD formula:\nIHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2) = 11 - 10 = **1**.\n\nAlternatively, we can look at the structure of the product (an alkyl-substituted cyclohexane). The only feature contributing to the IHD is the presence of the ring itself. A single ring always corresponds to an IHD of 1. All other sources of unsaturation from the reactant have been eliminated by the reduction.\n\nInitial IHD = 5\nThe reduction removes four degrees of unsaturation:\n1.  C=C in the ring\n2.  C=C in the vinyl group\n3.  C=O in the carboxylic acid\n4.  C=O in the aldehyde\nFinal IHD = Initial IHD - 4 = 5 - 4 = **1**.\n\nBoth methods give the same result.\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\nHere's the detailed thought process to arrive at the solution.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Reactant's Name and Structure:**\n    *   The reactant is \"2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid\".\n    *   **Core Structure:** `cyclohex-3-ene` -> A six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbon 3 and carbon 4. This structure contributes 1 ring and 1 pi bond.\n    *   **Main Functional Group:** `carboxylic acid` (-COOH) -> This is at position 1. It contains a C=O double bond, contributing 1 pi bond.\n    *   **Substituent 1:** `2-formyl` -> A formyl group (-CHO) is an aldehyde. It's at position 2 and contains a C=O double bond, contributing 1 pi bond.\n    *   **Substituent 2:** `5-vinyl` -> A vinyl group (-CH=CH2) is at position 5. It contains a C=C double bond, contributing 1 pi bond.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Reactant:**\n    The IHD (also known as the degree of unsaturation) is the sum of rings and pi bonds.\n    *   1 ring (from cyclohexane)\n    *   1 pi bond (from cyclohex-3-ene)\n    *   1 pi bond (from carboxylic acid's C=O)\n    *   1 pi bond (from formyl group's C=O)\n    *   1 pi bond (from vinyl group's C=C)\n    *   Total IHD of Reactant = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n\n3.  **Understand the Reaction:**\n    *   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus and excess of HI (hydroiodic acid).\n    *   **Function:** This combination is a very strong reducing agent. It performs the complete reduction of most oxygen-containing functional groups and multiple bonds to their corresponding alkanes.\n    *   **What gets reduced?**\n        *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3). This removes the C=O pi bond.\n        *   The formyl group (-CHO) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3). This removes the C=O pi bond.\n        *   The double bond in the cyclohexene ring (-C=C-) will be reduced to a single bond (-C-C-). This removes the C=C pi bond in the ring.\n        *   The double bond in the vinyl group (-CH=CH2) will be reduced to an ethyl group (-CH2-CH3). This removes the C=C pi bond in the vinyl group.\n    *   **What remains?**\n        *   The carbon skeleton, including the six-membered ring, remains intact. The ring itself is not opened by this reaction.\n\n4.  **Determine the Structure of the Product:**\n    The original C10 carbon skeleton is preserved, but all pi bonds are removed, and all oxygen atoms are replaced with hydrogens. The product is a saturated alkane with a single ring.\n    *   The `cyclohexene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring.\n    *   The product is a substituted cyclohexane. Since all functional groups and double bonds are reduced, the final molecule is a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon.\n\n5.  **Calculate the IHD of the Product:**\n    The IHD of the final product can be found by looking at its structure.\n    *   Number of rings: 1 (the cyclohexane ring).\n    *   Number of pi bonds: 0 (all have been reduced).\n    *   Total IHD of Product = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the final product is 1.\n\nThis logic can be confirmed with a simple calculation as well.\nThe product is a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon (a cycloalkane). The general formula for a cycloalkane is CₙH₂ₙ. From the initial structure, we have 10 carbon atoms (6 in the ring, 1 in COOH, 1 in CHO, 2 in vinyl). This C₁₀ skeleton is preserved. So, the product's formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n\nUsing the IHD formula:\nIHD = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1\nIHD = 10 - (20/2) + 0 + 1\nIHD = 10 - 10 + 1\nIHD = 1\n\nThus, the index of hydrogen deficiency is 1.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 59:\nHere is a step-by-step thinking process to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Reactant Molecule**\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down this IUPAC name to understand its structure and molecular formula.\n\n*   **Parent Structure:** \"cyclohex-3-ene\" indicates a six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between the 3rd and 4th carbon atoms.\n*   **Principal Functional Group:** \"carboxylic acid\" (-COOH) is the highest priority group, so it is located at carbon C1.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   \"2-formyl\": A formyl group (-CHO) is attached to C2.\n    *   \"5-vinyl\": A vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) is attached to C5.\n\nFrom this structure, let's determine the molecular formula of the reactant.\n\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 in the ring + 1 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO + 2 in -CH=CH₂ = **10 carbons**.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO = **3 oxygens**.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** Instead of manually counting hydrogens, which can be prone to error, we can use the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the reactant to find the hydrogen count. A saturated, non-cyclic alkane with 10 carbons would have the formula C₁₀H₂₂. Let's calculate the IHD from the known unsaturations in the reactant structure:\n    *   1 for the ring structure.\n    *   1 for the double bond in the ring (-3-ene).\n    *   1 for the carbonyl double bond (C=O) in the carboxylic acid.\n    *   1 for the carbonyl double bond (C=O) in the formyl group.\n    *   1 for the double bond in the vinyl group.\n    *   **Total IHD of Reactant = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5**.\n*   Each degree of unsaturation removes two hydrogen atoms from the saturated formula. So, the number of hydrogens is 22 - (2 * 5) = 12.\n*   Thus, the molecular formula of the reactant is **C₁₀H₁₂O₃**.\n\n### **2. Understand the Chemical Reaction**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI** (hydroiodic acid).\n\n*   This is a very powerful reducing agent combination in organic chemistry.\n*   Its primary function is to completely reduce oxygen-containing functional groups and unsaturation (double and triple bonds) to the corresponding saturated hydrocarbon (alkane).\n*   Specifically:\n    *   Carboxylic acid (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   Aldehyde/Formyl group (-CHO) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   All carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) are reduced to single bonds (C-C) by the addition of hydrogen.\n    *   All oxygen atoms are removed from the molecule.\n\n### **3. Determine the Product's Structure and Formula**\n\n*   The reaction does not add or remove any carbon atoms, so the product will also have **10 carbon atoms**.\n*   The reaction converts the reactant into a fully saturated hydrocarbon, while preserving the ring structure.\n*   The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring. The substituents are converted to saturated alkyl groups.\n*   The product is a substituted cyclohexane. Any molecule with a single ring and no multiple bonds is a **cycloalkane**.\n*   The general molecular formula for a cycloalkane is **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n*   Since our product has 10 carbon atoms (n=10), its molecular formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n\n### **4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (also known as the degree of unsaturation) quantifies the number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule.\n\n*   **Method 1: Using the Molecular Formula (C₁₀H₂₀)**\n    The IHD for a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ is calculated as:\n    IHD = x - (y/2) + 1\n    IHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1\n    IHD = 10 - 10 + 1\n    IHD = 1\n\n*   **Method 2: Using the Structure**\n    The product is a substituted cyclohexane. By definition, its structure contains:\n    *   Number of rings = 1\n    *   Number of pi bonds (double or triple bonds) = 0\n    IHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds)\n    IHD = 1 + 0\n    IHD = 1\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of the product is 1.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 1\nB) 5 (This is the IHD of the reactant)\nC) 3\nD) 0 (This would be an acyclic, saturated alkane)\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 60:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Reactant\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down its structure to understand its components and calculate its Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) for context.\n\n*   **Parent Structure**: `cyclohex-3-ene`. This is a six-membered ring containing one double bond (C=C). A ring itself contributes 1 to the IHD, and a double bond contributes another 1.\n*   **Substituents**:\n    1.  `carboxylic acid` (-COOH): This group contains a carbonyl (C=O) double bond, which contributes 1 to the IHD. It is at position 1.\n    2.  `formyl` (-CHO): This is an aldehyde group, which contains a carbonyl (C=O) double bond. This contributes 1 to the IHD. It is at position 2.\n    3.  `vinyl` (-CH=CH₂): This group contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), which contributes 1 to the IHD. It is at position 5.\n\nLet's calculate the IHD of the reactant:\n*   From the ring structure: 1\n*   From the C=C double bond in the ring: 1\n*   From the C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid: 1\n*   From the C=O double bond in the formyl group: 1\n*   From the C=C double bond in the vinyl group: 1\n*   **Total IHD of the reactant = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.**\n\nThis corresponds to option A, which is a potential trap for those who calculate the IHD of the reactant instead of the product.\n\nTo confirm this, let's determine the molecular formula of the reactant: **C₁₀H₁₂O₃**.\nUsing the IHD formula: `IHD = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1` (oxygen atoms don't affect the calculation).\n`IHD = 10 - 12/2 + 1 = 10 - 6 + 1 = 5`. This confirms our structural analysis.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Reaction\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI)**. This combination is a very powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry.\n\nThe function of Red P/HI is to perform exhaustive reduction. It reduces almost all oxygen-containing functional groups and carbon-carbon multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated alkanes.\n\n*   **Carboxylic acids (-COOH)** are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   **Aldehydes (-CHO)** are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   **Carbon-carbon double bonds (-C=C-)** are reduced to single bonds (-CH-CH-).\n*   **Carbonyl groups (C=O)** are reduced to methylene groups (-CH₂-).\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Structure of the Product\n\nApplying the effects of the reducing agent to our reactant:\n\n1.  The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring (the double bond is reduced).\n2.  The `-COOH` group at position 1 is reduced to a `-CH₃` (methyl) group.\n3.  The `-CHO` group at position 2 is reduced to a `-CH₃` (methyl) group.\n4.  The `-CH=CH₂` (vinyl) group at position 5 is reduced to a `-CH₂-CH₃` (ethyl) group.\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane. Specifically, it is **1-ethyl-2,5-dimethylcyclohexane** (after re-numbering according to IUPAC rules, though the exact name is not necessary for the solution).\n\nThe key features of the product are:\n*   It contains a single ring (the cyclohexane ring).\n*   All bonds within the structure are single bonds (it is a saturated molecule).\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of the Product\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) or degree of unsaturation is calculated based on the presence of rings or multiple bonds.\n\n*   Rings contribute 1 to the IHD for each ring.\n*   Double bonds contribute 1 to the IHD for each double bond.\n*   Triple bonds contribute 2 to the IHD for each triple bond.\n\nIn our product molecule (a substituted cyclohexane):\n*   Number of rings = 1\n*   Number of double bonds = 0\n*   Number of triple bonds = 0\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the product = 1 + 0 + 0 = **1**.\n\nAlternatively, we can find the molecular formula of the product. The starting material was C₁₀H₁₂O₃. The reduction reaction removes all oxygen atoms and saturates all double bonds, but doesn't change the number of carbon atoms.\n*   **Carbons:** The product still has 10 carbon atoms (C₁₀).\n*   **Hydrogens:** A saturated monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane) has the general formula CₙH₂ₙ. For n=10, the formula is **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\nNow, we use the IHD formula for the product, C₁₀H₂₀:\n`IHD = C - H/2 + 1`\n`IHD = 10 - 20/2 + 1`\n`IHD = 10 - 10 + 1`\n`IHD = 1`\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\nFinal Answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>.",

Analyze the Reactant**\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down its structure to understand its components and calculate its initial index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD). The IHD (also known as the degree of unsaturation) represents the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n\n*   **Cyclohex-3-ene**: This is a six-membered carbon ring containing one carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n    *   The ring itself contributes 1 to the IHD.\n    *   The C=C double bond within the ring contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **Carboxylic acid**: This is a -COOH group. It contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n    *   The C=O double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **Formyl group**: This is a -CHO group (an aldehyde). It also contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n    *   The C=O double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **Vinyl group**: This is a -CH=CH2 group. It contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n    *   The C=C double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n\n**Calculating the IHD of the reactant:**\nBy summing the contributions from each part of the structure:\nIHD (reactant) = 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C in ring) + 1 (C=O in acid) + 1 (C=O in formyl) + 1 (C=C in vinyl) = 5.\n\nSo, the index of hydrogen deficiency of the starting material is 5.\n\n### **2. Understand the Reaction**\n\nThe reagent used is **red phosphorus (Red P) and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI)**. This combination is a very powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. Its key function is to perform a complete reduction of a wide range of functional groups to the corresponding alkane. Specifically:\n\n*   It reduces aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) to methyl groups (-CH3).\n*   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to carbon-carbon single bonds (C-C).\n*   Essentially, it removes all pi bonds and most heteroatoms (like oxygen), converting the molecule into a saturated hydrocarbon.\n*   Importantly, this reaction does not break stable ring structures.\n\n### **3. Determine the Structure and IHD of the Product**\n\nThe reaction will act on all the functional groups and double bonds present in the reactant:\n\n1.  The **C=C double bond** in the cyclohexene ring will be reduced to a C-C single bond. This removes 1 unit of IHD.\n2.  The **C=O double bond** in the carboxylic acid group will be reduced. This removes 1 unit of IHD.\n3.  The **C=O double bond** in the formyl group will be reduced. This removes 1 unit of IHD.\n4.  The **C=C double bond** in the vinyl group will be reduced to a C-C single bond. This removes 1 unit of IHD.\n\nThe **ring structure** itself will remain intact.\n\n**Calculating the IHD of the product:**\nThe original IHD was 5. The reaction removes the four pi bonds, so it reduces the IHD by 4.\n\nIHD (product) = IHD (reactant) - IHD (removed by reaction)\nIHD (product) = 5 - 4 = 1\n\nThe resulting molecule is a saturated cycloalkane (specifically, a substituted cyclohexane). A saturated monocyclic compound always has an IHD of 1, which corresponds to the presence of the single ring.\n\n### **4. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe reaction reduces all double bonds (both C=C and C=O) in the starting material but leaves the ring structure intact. The four pi bonds are eliminated, reducing the IHD from 5 to 1. The remaining IHD of 1 is due to the cyclohexane ring in the product.\n\nTherefore, the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\nThe correct option is B.\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\n*   **Step 1: Analyze the Reactant**\n    The reactant is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

A ring counts as one degree of unsaturation, and a double bond counts as another. So, this part contributes 1 (for the ring) + 1 (for the C=C bond) = 2 to the IHD.\n    *   **Carboxylic acid (-COOH):** This functional group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This contributes 1 to the IHD.\n    *   **Formyl (-CHO):** This functional group (an aldehyde) also contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This contributes 1 to the IHD.\n    *   **Vinyl (-CH=CH2):** This group contains a carbon-carbon double bond. This contributes 1 to the IHD.\n\n    Summing these up, the total IHD of the reactant is:\n    IHD_reactant = 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C in ring) + 1 (C=O in acid) + 1 (C=O in formyl) + 1 (C=C in vinyl) = 5.\n\n    Alternatively, we can determine the molecular formula and calculate the IHD.\n    - Carbons: 6 (ring) + 1 (acid) + 1 (formyl) + 2 (vinyl) = 10 C\n    - Oxygens: 2 (acid) + 1 (formyl) = 3 O\n    - Hydrogens: The formula for a C10 acyclic alkane is C10H22. The IHD is the number of pairs of hydrogens missing compared to this.\n    Let's draw the structure and count hydrogens: C10H12O3.\n    IHD = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1 = 10 - 12/2 + 0/2 + 1 = 10 - 6 + 1 = 5.\n    This confirms the IHD of the starting material is 5.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the Reaction**\n    The reagent used is red phosphorus with an excess of hydroiodic acid (Red P + HI). This is a powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. Its effect is to reduce various functional groups to alkanes. Specifically:\n    *   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n    *   It reduces carbon-oxygen double bonds (C=O) in aldehydes and carboxylic acids completely to methylene (-CH2-) or methyl (-CH3) groups.\n    *   The reaction is strong enough to remove all oxygen atoms from the molecule.\n    *   Importantly, this reaction does not break open saturated rings.\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the Product and its IHD**\n    The reaction will cause the following changes to the reactant's structure:\n    1.  The C=C double bond in the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a single bond. This removes 1 degree of unsaturation.\n    2.  The C=C double bond in the vinyl group is reduced to a single bond. This removes 1 degree of unsaturation.\n    3.  The C=O double bond in the formyl group is reduced. This removes 1 degree of unsaturation.\n    4.  The C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group is reduced. This removes 1 degree of unsaturation.\n\n    The ring structure itself remains intact. Therefore, the only component contributing to the IHD in the final product is the cyclohexane ring.\n\n    The change in IHD can be calculated as:\n    IHD_product = IHD_reactant - (number of π bonds reduced)\n    IHD_product = 5 - 4 = 1.\n\n    The final product is a substituted cyclohexane. Any saturated monocyclic alkane (like cyclohexane and its derivatives) has an IHD of 1, which accounts for the ring. Since there are no double or triple bonds left in the product, its IHD is exactly 1.\n\n*   **Step 4: Conclusion**\n    The product obtained from the reaction has an Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of 1.\n\nFinal check using the molecular formula of the product:\nThe reactant is C10H12O3. The reaction removes all 3 oxygen atoms and saturates all 4 pi bonds. The product will be a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon with 10 carbon atoms. The general formula for a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon is CnH2n. Therefore, the product's formula is C10H20.\nIHD_product = C - H/2 + 1 = 10 - 20/2 + 1 = 10 - 10 + 1 = 1.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\n**1.

A saturated, monocyclic hydrocarbon has the general formula CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   The total number of carbons is 10 (6 in the ring + 1 from the first methyl + 1 from the second methyl + 2 from the ethyl). So, n=10.\n    *   The molecular formula is **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, indicates the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. It can be calculated from the molecular formula.\n\n*   **Formula:** IHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\n    (Note: Halogens are treated like H, Nitrogens add to the count, and Oxygens are ignored).\n*   **Calculation for the product (C₁₀H₂₀):**\n    *   C = 10\n    *   H = 20\n    *   IHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2)\n    *   IHD = 11 - 10\n    *   IHD = 1\n\nAlternatively, we can determine the IHD by inspecting the final structure:\n*   1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane has:\n    *   Number of rings = 1\n    *   Number of double bonds = 0\n    *   Number of triple bonds = 0\n*   IHD = (number of rings) + (number of double bonds) + 2*(number of triple bonds)\n*   IHD = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the final product is 1.

Let's break down its structure to understand the functional groups and unsaturations present.\n    *   **Core structure:** A six-membered ring (cyclohexane derivative).\n    *   **Unsaturations:**\n        *   `cyclohex-3-ene`: A carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) within the ring.\n        *   `5-vinyl`: A vinyl group (-CH=CH2) attached to the ring, which contains another C=C double bond.\n        *   `2-formyl`: An aldehyde group (-CHO) which contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n        *   `carboxylic acid`: A carboxyl group (-COOH) which contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n    *   **Rings:** There is one ring in the molecule.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction:**\n    The reagent is red phosphorus and excess of hydroiodic acid (Red P + excess HI). This is a very strong reducing agent. Its primary function is to completely reduce a wide range of functional groups to their corresponding alkanes. Specifically:\n    *   It reduces alkenes (C=C) to alkanes (C-C).\n    *   It reduces aldehydes (-CHO) to methyl groups (-CH3).\n    *   It reduces carboxylic acids (-COOH) to methyl groups (-CH3).\n    *   Essentially, it removes all oxygen atoms and saturates all carbon-carbon double and triple bonds.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product's Structure:**\n    The reaction will act on all the functional groups and unsaturations of the starting material, but it will not break the stable six-membered carbon ring.\n    *   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring will be reduced to a saturated `cyclohexane` ring.\n    *   The `vinyl group` (-CH=CH2) will be reduced to an `ethyl group` (-CH2-CH3).\n    *   The `formyl group` (-CHO) will be reduced to a `methyl group` (-CH3).\n    *   The `carboxylic acid group` (-COOH) will be reduced to a `methyl group` (-CH3).\n\n    The final product is a saturated, substituted cycloalkane. The carbon skeleton is preserved. The initial molecule has a 6-carbon ring, a 2-carbon vinyl group, a 1-carbon formyl group, and a 1-carbon carboxyl group, for a total of 10 carbon atoms. The product will also have 10 carbon atoms, arranged as a substituted cyclohexane. The specific name would be a derivative of ethyl-dimethylcyclohexane, but we don't need the exact name to find the IHD.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product:**\n    The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, is calculated by the formula:\n    IHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds)\n\n    Let's analyze the structure of the product:\n    *   **Number of rings:** The original six-membered ring is not broken during the reaction. So, the product has 1 ring.\n    *   **Number of π bonds:** The reaction with Red P + HI reduces all C=C and C=O double bonds to single bonds. Therefore, the product has 0 π bonds.\n\n    Plugging these values into the formula:\n    IHD = 1 (for the ring) + 0 (for π bonds) = 1\n\n    Alternatively, we can find the molecular formula of the product. The product is a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon with 10 carbon atoms. The general formula for a cycloalkane is CnH2n.

Determine the Structure and Molecular Formula of the Reactant\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down the name to determine its structure:\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: A six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbon 3 and carbon 4.\n*   **carboxylic acid**: A -COOH group is present. By convention, this is at position C1.\n*   **2-formyl**: An aldehyde group (-CHO) is attached to C2.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A vinyl group (-CH=CH2) is attached to C5.\n\nThe structure is as follows:\n```\n      (COOH)\n        |\n    H - C1 --- C2 - H - (CHO)\n        |      |\n   H2 - C6     C3 - H\n        |      ||\n    H - C5     C4 - H\n        |\n      (-CH=CH2)\n```\n\nNow, let's determine the molecular formula by counting the atoms:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 in the ring + 1 in COOH + 1 in CHO + 2 in the vinyl group = **10 carbons (C10)**.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):**\n    *   On the ring: 1(at C1) + 1(at C2) + 1(at C3) + 1(at C4) + 1(at C5) + 2(at C6) = 7 H\n    *   In the functional groups: 1(in COOH) + 1(in CHO) + 3(in vinyl, -CH=CH2) = 5 H\n    *   Total H = 7 + 5 = **12 hydrogens (H12)**.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 in COOH + 1 in CHO = **3 oxygens (O3)**.\n\nSo, the molecular formula of the reactant is **C10H12O3**.\n\n*As an aside, we can calculate the IHD of the reactant for confirmation:\nIHD = C + 1 - H/2 = 10 + 1 - 12/2 = 11 - 6 = 5.\nThis corresponds to 1 ring, 1 C=C in the ring, 1 C=C in the vinyl group, 1 C=O in the carboxyl group, and 1 C=O in the formyl group (1+1+1+1+1 = 5).*\n\n### 2.

The final product is a substituted cyclohexane. The exact name would be an isomer of ethyl-dimethylcyclohexane, but what matters is its molecular formula.\n\nLet's determine the molecular formula of the product:\n*   **Carbon (C):** The number of carbon atoms does not change. So, it remains **10 (C10)**.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** The product is a fully saturated monocyclic alkane (a substituted cyclohexane). The general formula for such a compound is **CnH2n**. For n=10, the formula is **C10H20**.\n\nSo, the molecular formula of the product is **C10H20**.\n\n### 3.

Since the carbon skeleton is preserved, the product will still have 10 carbon atoms. All oxygen atoms are removed, and all double bonds are converted to single bonds by adding hydrogen. The product is a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon.\n\n    A saturated hydrocarbon with `C` carbon atoms and `R` rings has the general formula **CₙH₂ₙ₊₂₋₂R**.\n    *   In our product, the number of carbon atoms `n` = 10.\n    *   The number of rings `R` = 1 (the cyclohexane ring).\n    *   Plugging these values into the formula:\n        *   Number of Hydrogens = 2 * 10 + 2 - 2 * 1 = 20 + 2 - 2 = 20.\n\n    So, the molecular formula of the product is **C10H20**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product:**\n    The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (also known as the degree of unsaturation) represents the number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule. The formula for IHD is:\n    IHD = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\n    Where C is the number of carbons, H is hydrogens, X is halogens, and N is nitrogens.\n\n    For the product with the formula **C10H20**:\n    *   C = 10\n    *   H = 20\n    *   X = 0\n    *   N = 0\n\n    IHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2) = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\n    Alternatively, we can determine the IHD by inspecting the structure of the product. The product is a substituted cyclohexane. It contains one ring and no double or triple bonds. Each ring contributes 1 to the IHD. Therefore, the IHD is 1.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$.\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n*   **Step 1: Analyze the reactant's structure and its Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD).**\n    The reactant is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's break down its structure to understand its components and calculate its IHD.\n    *   `cyclohex`: This indicates a six-membered carbon ring. A ring contributes 1 to the IHD.\n    *   `-3-ene`: This indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) within the ring. A double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n    *   `carboxylic acid` (-COOH): This functional group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n    *   `formyl` (-CHO): This is an aldehyde group, which also contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n    *   `vinyl` (-CH=CH2): This group contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). This double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n\n    So, the total IHD of the reactant is the sum of contributions from all these features:\n    IHD(reactant) = 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C in ring) + 1 (C=O in COOH) + 1 (C=O in CHO) + 1 (C=C in vinyl) = 5.\n    This corresponds to option A, but the question asks for the IHD of the *product*.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the reaction and the effect of the reagents.**\n    The reactant is treated with red phosphorus and an excess of HI (Red P + HI). This combination is a very strong reducing agent. Its primary function is to carry out the complete reduction of oxygen-containing functional groups and any carbon-carbon multiple bonds.\n    *   It reduces aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) completely to the corresponding alkane parts (i.e., -CH3 groups).\n    *   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n    *   Essentially, it removes all oxygen atoms and saturates all pi bonds.\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the structure of the product.**\n    Applying the effects of Red P + HI to our reactant:\n    *   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring will be reduced to a `cyclohexane` ring (the C=C becomes C-C). The ring structure itself remains.\n    *   The `carboxylic acid` group will be reduced to a methyl (-CH3) group.\n    *   The `formyl` group will be reduced to a methyl (-CH3) group.\n    *   The `vinyl` group (-CH=CH2) will be reduced to an ethyl (-CH2-CH3) group.\n\n    The final product will be a saturated substituted cyclohexane. All the double bonds (both C=C and C=O) will be gone. The only feature contributing to the IHD will be the cyclohexane ring itself.\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product.**\n    The IHD is defined as the sum of the number of rings and the number of pi bonds in a molecule.\n    *   Number of rings in the product = 1 (the cyclohexane ring).\n    *   Number of pi bonds in the product = 0 (all double and triple bonds have been reduced to single bonds).\n\n    Therefore, the IHD of the product is:\n    IHD(product) = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\n    Alternatively, we can determine the molecular formula. The reactant has a carbon skeleton of C10 (6 in the ring, 1 in COOH, 1 in CHO, 2 in vinyl). The product, being a saturated monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane), will have the general formula CnH2n. Since n=10, the formula is C10H20.\n    Using the IHD formula: IHD = C + 1 - H/2 = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\nBoth methods confirm that the IHD of the final product is 1.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 5\nB) 0\nC) 1\nD) 3\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThe user wants to find the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product of a specific chemical reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reactant**\nThe reactant is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's break down its structure to identify all sources of unsaturation:\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: This is a six-membered ring with one double bond.\n    *   The ring itself contributes 1 to the IHD.\n    *   The double bond (C=C) within the ring contributes another 1 to the IHD.\n*   **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**: This group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n    *   This C=O double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **formyl (-CHO)**: This is an aldehyde group, which also contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n    *   This C=O double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **vinyl (-CH=CH2)**: This group contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n    *   This C=C double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n\nSumming these up, the IHD of the starting material (reactant) is 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C in ring) + 1 (C=O in acid) + 1 (C=O in formyl) + 1 (C=C in vinyl) = 5.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction**\nThe reagents are red phosphorus (Red P) and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. It performs a complete reduction on the following functional groups:\n*   It reduces aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) all the way down to methyl groups (-CH3).\n*   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n*   It reduces carbon-oxygen double bonds (C=O) to methylene groups (-CH2-).\n\nIn essence, this reaction will remove all oxygen atoms and saturate all multiple bonds.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Product and its IHD**\nApplying the effects of the reaction to our reactant:\n*   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring (the C=C bond is reduced).\n*   The `carboxylic acid` group becomes a `methyl` group.\n*   The `formyl` group becomes a `methyl` group.\n*   The `vinyl` group becomes an `ethyl` group (-CH2-CH3).\n\nThe final product is a fully saturated substituted cyclohexane. Let's calculate its IHD:\n*   **Rings**: The product still contains the six-membered ring. This contributes 1 to the IHD.\n*   **Multiple Bonds**: All C=C and C=O double bonds have been reduced to single bonds. There are no multiple bonds left. This contributes 0 to the IHD.\n\nTherefore, the total IHD of the product is 1 (for the ring) + 0 (for multiple bonds) = 1.\n\nThe correct answer is 1. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\n### **1.

A `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH). By IUPAC convention, the carbon of the ring attached to this primary functional group is C1.\n    2.  A `formyl` group (-CHO, an aldehyde) at position C2.\n    3.  A `vinyl` group (-CH=CH2) at position C5.\n    4.  A carbon-carbon double bond (`C=C`) within the ring between C3 and C4.\n\nTo understand the transformation, we need to identify all the features that can be reduced. These are:\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which contains a C=O double bond.\n*   The formyl group (-CHO), which contains a C=O double bond.\n*   The vinyl group (-CH=CH2), which contains a C=C double bond.\n*   The double bond within the cyclohexene ring.\n\nThe molecule also has one ring.\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, for the reactant can be calculated by summing the number of rings and pi (π) bonds:\n*   1 ring\n*   1 π bond in the cyclohexene ring (C=C)\n*   1 π bond in the vinyl group (C=C)\n*   1 π bond in the carboxylic acid group (C=O)\n*   1 π bond in the formyl group (C=O)\n*   **Total IHD of reactant = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5**\n\n### **2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\nThe reagent used is **red phosphorus and excess of HI** (Hydroiodic acid).\n\n*   This is a very powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry.\n*   Its primary function is to reduce various functional groups completely down to the corresponding alkane.\n*   Specifically, it will perform the following reductions on the reactant:\n    *   **Carboxylic acid (-COOH)** is reduced to a **methyl group (-CH3)**.\n    *   **Aldehyde (-CHO)** is reduced to a **methyl group (-CH3)**.\n    *   **All C=C double bonds** are reduced to **C-C single bonds** (hydrogenation). This applies to both the vinyl group and the double bond in the ring.\n\n### **3. Determine the Structure and Formula of the Product**\n\nLet's apply the effects of the reduction to our starting material:\n\n*   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring (the C=C bond is saturated).\n*   The `carboxylic acid` group at C1 becomes a `methyl` group.\n*   The `formyl` group at C2 becomes a `methyl` group.\n*   The `vinyl` group at C5 becomes an `ethyl` group (-CH2-CH3).\n\nThe final product is a **saturated substituted cyclohexane**. It has no double bonds, and all oxygen atoms have been removed. The carbon skeleton is preserved.\n\n*   **Carbon Count:** The number of carbon atoms does not change during this reduction. We can count them in the reactant: 6 (ring) + 1 (COOH) + 1 (CHO) + 2 (vinyl) = 10 carbon atoms. So, the product has 10 carbon atoms.\n*   **Structure:** The product is a monocyclic (one ring) alkane.\n*   **General Formula:** The general formula for a saturated monocyclic alkane is **CnH2n**.\n*   **Molecular Formula of Product:** Since n = 10, the molecular formula of the product is **C10H20**.\n\n### **4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe IHD can be calculated in two ways:\n\n**Method 1: From the structure**\nIHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds)\n*   Number of rings in the product = 1 (the cyclohexane ring).\n*   Number of π bonds in the product = 0 (the molecule is fully saturated).\n*   **IHD = 1 + 0 = 1**\n\n**Method 2: From the molecular formula (C10H20)**\nThe formula for IHD is: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2), where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens.\n*   IHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2)\n*   IHD = 11 - 10\n*   **IHD = 1**\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.

Its key functions are:\n\n*   It reduces aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) completely to the corresponding alkyl groups (-CH3).\n*   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n*   It does not typically break stable carbon-carbon single bonds, such as those in a cyclohexane ring.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Structure of the Product**\n\nThe reaction will reduce all the functional groups and double bonds in the starting molecule, leaving a fully saturated hydrocarbon skeleton.\n\n*   The **cyclohexene ring** will be reduced to a **cyclohexane ring** (the C=C becomes C-C).\n*   The **carboxylic acid group** at position 1 will be reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH3).\n*   The **formyl group** at position 2 will be reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH3).\n*   The **vinyl group** at position 5 will be reduced to an **ethyl group** (-CH2CH3).\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane, which is a saturated molecule. It contains no double or triple bonds.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nNow, we calculate the IHD for the final product.\n\nUsing the definition IHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds):\n*   **Number of rings**: The product still contains the six-membered cyclohexane ring. So, the number of rings is 1.\n*   **Number of π bonds**: All the double bonds (C=C and C=O) from the reactant have been reduced to single bonds. The product is fully saturated. So, the number of π bonds is 0.\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the product = 1 (ring) + 0 (π bonds) = **1**.\n\n**Alternative Method: Using Molecular Formula**\n\n1.  **Reactant Formula:** Let's find the molecular formula of the reactant (C10H12O3) to determine the number of carbons.\n    *   Ring: C6\n    *   -COOH: C1\n    *   -CHO: C1\n    *   -CH=CH2: C2\n    *   Total Carbons = 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10.\n2.  **Product Formula:** The reaction removes all oxygens and adds hydrogens to saturate the molecule, but the number of carbons remains the same (C=10). The product is a substituted cyclohexane. The general formula for a monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane) is CnH2n.

The general formula for a saturated hydrocarbon with one ring is CnH2n.\n    Since our product has 10 carbons (n=10), its molecular formula must be C10H(2*10) = **C10H20**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product.**\n    The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, tells us the sum of the number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule. The formula is:\n    IHD = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1\n    Where C is the number of carbons, H is the number of hydrogens, and N is the number of nitrogens.\n\n    For our product with the formula C10H20:\n    *   C = 10\n    *   H = 20\n    *   N = 0\n    IHD = 10 - (20/2) + 0 + 1\n    IHD = 10 - 10 + 1\n    IHD = 1\n\n    Alternatively, we can find the IHD by inspecting the final structure.

This is a six-membered carbon ring with one double bond. This structure contributes an IHD of 1 (for the ring) + 1 (for the double bond) = 2.\n2.  **Substituents:**\n    *   **Carboxylic acid (-COOH)** at position 1. This group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), which adds 1 to the IHD.\n    *   **Formyl group (-CHO)** at position 2. This group is an aldehyde and contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), which adds 1 to the IHD.\n    *   **Vinyl group (-CH=CH2)** at position 5. This group contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), which adds 1 to the IHD.\n\n3.  **Total IHD of the Starting Material:**\n    *   IHD = (from ring) + (from C=C in ring) + (from C=O in COOH) + (from C=O in CHO) + (from C=C in vinyl)\n    *   IHD = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5\n\nTo confirm, let's determine the molecular formula of the starting material.\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 in the ring + 1 in COOH + 1 in CHO + 2 in vinyl = 10 carbons.\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** A detailed count gives H=12. (C1-H, C2-H, C3-H, C4-H, C5-H, C6-2H, COOH-H, CHO-H, Vinyl-3H = 1+1+1+1+1+2+1+1+3 = 12 hydrogens).\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 in COOH + 1 in CHO = 3 oxygens.\n*   The molecular formula is **C10H12O3**.\n*   Using the IHD formula: IHD = C - H/2 + 1 = 10 - 12/2 + 1 = 10 - 6 + 1 = 5. This matches our structural analysis.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Reaction\nThe reagent is **red phosphorus (Red P) and excess hydriodic acid (HI)**. This combination is a powerful reducing agent. Its effect on the functional groups present in the starting material is as follows:\n\n*   It reduces carboxylic acids (-COOH) completely to methyl groups (-CH3).\n*   It reduces aldehydes (-CHO) completely to methyl groups (-CH3).\n*   It reduces alkenes (C=C double bonds) to alkanes (C-C single bonds).\n\nIn this reaction, all double bonds (both C=C and C=O) will be saturated with hydrogen, and all oxygen atoms will be removed.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Structure and Formula of the Product\nThe reaction transforms the starting material:\n\n*   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring is reduced to a `cyclohexane` ring.\n*   The `-COOH` group at C1 is reduced to a `-CH3` group.\n*   The `-CHO` group at C2 is reduced to a `-CH3` group.\n*   The `-CH=CH2` group at C5 is reduced to an ethyl group `(-CH2-CH3)`.\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane (specifically, 1-ethyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohexane, though the exact isomerism doesn't affect the molecular formula). The product is a **saturated monocyclic alkane**.\n\n1.  **Carbon Atoms (C):** The number of carbon atoms does not change during the reduction. The product still has **10 carbons**.\n2.  **Hydrogen Atoms (H):** The general formula for a saturated monocyclic alkane is CnH2n. Since our product has 10 carbon atoms, its formula is C10H(2*10) = **C10H20**.\n3.  **Oxygen Atoms (O):** All oxygens are removed.\n\nThe molecular formula of the product is **C10H20**.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, can be calculated using the molecular formula. The formula is:\n\nIHD = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1\n\nFor a hydrocarbon (containing only C and H), this simplifies to:\n\nIHD = C - H/2 + 1\n\nPlugging in the values for the product (C=10, H=20):\n\nIHD = 10 - 20/2 + 1\nIHD = 10 - 10 + 1\nIHD = 1\n\nAlternatively, we can reason from the structure.

It performs the following reductions:\n    *   It completely reduces aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) to their corresponding alkane groups (in this case, methyl groups, -CH3).\n    *   It reduces (saturates) carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n    *   The carbon skeleton, including the ring, remains intact.\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the structure and molecular formula of the product.**\n    The reduction process transforms the reactant as follows:\n    *   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring (the double bond is saturated).\n    *   The `carboxylic acid` group at C1 is reduced to a `methyl` group (-CH3).\n    *   The `formyl` group at C2 is reduced to a `methyl` group (-CH3).\n    *   The `vinyl` group (-CH=CH2) at C5 is reduced to an `ethyl` group (-CH2-CH3).\n\n    The resulting product is 1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane. The number of carbon atoms remains the same (C10). Since the product is now a fully saturated cycloalkane (containing only single bonds within a single ring), its general formula is CnH2n.\n    Therefore, the molecular formula of the product is **C10H20**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product.**\n    The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (also known as the degree of unsaturation) for a molecule with the formula CxHyOz is calculated as:\n    IHD = C - (H/2) + 1\n\n    For our product with the formula C10H20:\n    IHD = 10 - (20 / 2) + 1\n    IHD = 10 - 10 + 1\n    IHD = 1\n\n    The IHD of 1 is due to the presence of the single ring structure (the cyclohexane ring). All the pi bonds (from C=C and C=O) have been eliminated by the reduction.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactant Structure**\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down the name to understand its structure and calculate its initial Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD). The IHD (also known as the degree of unsaturation) is calculated as the sum of the number of rings and the number of pi (π) bonds in the molecule.\n\n*   **`cyclohex`**: This indicates a six-membered ring. (Contribution to IHD = 1)\n*   **`-3-ene`**: This indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) within the ring. (Contribution to IHD = 1)\n*   **`carboxylic acid` (-COOH)**: This functional group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). (Contribution to IHD = 1)\n*   **`formyl` (-CHO)**: This functional group (an aldehyde) also contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). (Contribution to IHD = 1)\n*   **`vinyl` (-CH=CH2)**: This substituent contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). (Contribution to IHD = 1)\n\nSo, the total IHD of the reactant is the sum of all these contributions:\nIHD (reactant) = 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C in ring) + 1 (C=O in acid) + 1 (C=O in formyl) + 1 (C=C in vinyl) = **5**.\n\nAlternatively, we can determine the molecular formula and calculate the IHD from it.\nThe structure is a C6 ring, a COOH group (1C), a CHO group (1C), and a vinyl group (2C). Total carbons = 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10 carbons.\nLet's find the number of hydrogens. The molecular formula is C10H12O3.\nThe IHD formula is: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 11 - 6 = **5**.\nBoth methods yield an IHD of 5 for the reactant.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\nThe reagent used is **red phosphorus with an excess of hydroiodic acid (Red P + HI)**. This is a very powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. Its key characteristics are:\n*   It reduces carbonyl groups (from aldehydes, ketones, and carboxylic acids) completely to alkanes (CH2 or CH3 groups).\n*   It reduces carbon-carbon double and triple bonds to single bonds (alkanes).\n*   It reduces alcohols to alkanes.\n*   Crucially, it does **not** break open stable aliphatic rings like cyclohexane.\n\n**3. Determine the Product Structure and its IHD**\n\nThe reaction will proceed as follows:\n*   The C=C double bond in the `cyclohexene` ring will be reduced to a C-C single bond.\n*   The C=C double bond in the `vinyl` group will be reduced to a C-C single bond.\n*   The C=O double bond in the `carboxylic acid` group will be completely reduced.\n*   The C=O double bond in the `formyl` group will be completely reduced.\n\nEssentially, all pi bonds in the molecule are removed by the reduction. The carbon skeleton, including the six-membered ring, remains intact.\n\nThe product will be a **saturated substituted cyclohexane**.\n*   The number of rings in the product is 1 (the cyclohexane ring).\n*   The number of pi bonds in the product is 0 (since all double bonds were reduced).\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the product is:\nIHD (product) = (number of rings) + (number of pi bonds)\nIHD (product) = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe reaction with Red P / HI reduces all double bonds (both C=C and C=O) in the starting material but leaves the ring structure intact. The initial molecule has an IHD of 5 (1 from the ring, 4 from various double bonds). The reaction removes all 4 double bonds, thus reducing the IHD by 4.\n\nFinal IHD = Initial IHD - (Number of pi bonds reduced)\nFinal IHD = 5 - 4 = 1.\n\nThe resulting molecule is a substituted cyclohexane, which has one ring and no double bonds, giving it an index of hydrogen deficiency of 1.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the final product.\n\n**1.

Let's break down its structure to understand its properties and calculate its initial IHD.\n\n*   **Parent Structure:** `cyclohex-3-ene`. This is a six-membered carbon ring with one carbon-carbon double bond. A ring itself counts as one degree of unsaturation, and the double bond adds another.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   `carboxylic acid` (-COOH): This group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n    *   `2-formyl` (-CHO): This is an aldehyde group, which also contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n    *   `5-vinyl` (-CH=CH2): This group contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n\nLet's calculate the initial IHD (also known as degrees of unsaturation) for the reactant:\n*   1 from the ring structure.\n*   1 from the C=C bond within the ring.\n*   1 from the C=C bond in the vinyl group.\n*   1 from the C=O bond in the formyl group.\n*   1 from the C=O bond in the carboxylic acid group.\n\nTotal IHD of the reactant = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n\nTo find the molecular formula, let's count the atoms:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 in the ring + 1 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO + 2 in -CH=CH2 = 10 carbons.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** A systematic count reveals 12 hydrogens (C10H12O3).\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO = 3 oxygens.\nThe molecular formula of the reactant is C10H12O3.\nChecking IHD with the formula: IHD = C + 1 - H/2 = 10 + 1 - 12/2 = 11 - 6 = 5. This confirms our structural analysis.\n\n**2. Identify the Reaction and Predict the Product**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess of HI** (hydroiodic acid). This combination is a very powerful and exhaustive reducing agent in organic chemistry. Its effect is to:\n\n*   Reduce all oxygen-containing functional groups (alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids) completely to the corresponding alkanes (i.e., replacing C=O and C-O bonds with C-H bonds).\n*   Reduce (saturate) all carbon-carbon double bonds and triple bonds to single bonds.\n\nApplying this to our reactant:\n*   The `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The `formyl` group (-CHO) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The `vinyl` group (-CH=CH2) will be reduced to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n*   The `C=C double bond` inside the cyclohexene ring will be reduced to a C-C single bond, converting the cyclohexene ring into a cyclohexane ring.\n\nThe carbon skeleton is preserved. The starting molecule has 10 carbon atoms, and the product will also have 10 carbon atoms. All multiple bonds and oxygen atoms will be removed, resulting in a fully saturated hydrocarbon that retains the original ring structure.\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane. Specifically, it is 4-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane (the exact name is not necessary, but the structure is a cyclohexane ring with two methyl and one ethyl group).\n\n**3. Determine the Molecular Formula and IHD of the Product**\n\nThe product is a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon. The general formula for such a compound is **CnH2n**.\nSince our product has 10 carbon atoms (n=10), its molecular formula is **C10H20**.\n\nNow, let's calculate the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) for the product, C10H20.\n\n**Method 1: Using the IHD Formula**\nThe formula for IHD for a hydrocarbon is:\nIHD = C - H/2 + 1\nIHD = 10 - (20 / 2) + 1\nIHD = 10 - 10 + 1\nIHD = 1\n\n**Method 2: Using the Structure**\nThe IHD is the sum of rings and multiple bonds.\n*   Number of rings = 1 (the cyclohexane ring).\n*   Number of double bonds = 0.\n*   Number of triple bonds = 0.\n\nIHD = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1.\n\nBoth methods yield an IHD of 1.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained from the reaction is 1.

Let's break down its structure:\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: This is a six-membered carbon ring with one double bond between carbon 3 and carbon 4.\n*   **carboxylic acid**: A -COOH group is attached to the ring. By IUPAC convention for carboxylic acids, this carbon is C1.\n*   **2-formyl**: A formyl group (-CHO, an aldehyde) is attached to C2.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A vinyl group (-CH=CH2) is attached to C5.\n\nLet's determine the molecular formula of this reactant:\n*   **Carbon (C)**:\n    *   6 carbons in the ring.\n    *   1 carbon in the -COOH group.\n    *   1 carbon in the -CHO group.\n    *   2 carbons in the -CH=CH2 group.\n    *   Total Carbon atoms = 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10.\n*   **Hydrogen (H)**:\n    *   Let's count the hydrogens on each carbon of the ring:\n        *   C1 (bonded to COOH, C2, C6): 1H\n        *   C2 (bonded to CHO, C1, C3): 1H\n        *   C3 (double bond to C4, single bond to C2): 1H\n        *   C4 (double bond to C3, single bond to C5): 1H\n        *   C5 (bonded to vinyl, C4, C6): 1H\n        *   C6 (bonded to C1, C5): 2H\n    *   Hydrogens on the substituent groups:\n        *   -COOH: 1H\n        *   -CHO: 1H\n        *   -CH=CH2: 3H\n    *   Total Hydrogen atoms = (1+1+1+1+1+2) + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12.\n*   **Oxygen (O)**:\n    *   2 oxygens in the -COOH group.\n    *   1 oxygen in the -CHO group.\n    *   Total Oxygen atoms = 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nSo, the molecular formula of the reactant is **C10H12O3**.\n\n**2.

Since the starting material has 10 carbon atoms, the product will also have 10 carbon atoms. It will be a derivative of cyclohexane, meaning it is a monocyclic alkane (a single ring, no double or triple bonds).\n\n**4.

Let's calculate its IHD:\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency is the sum of the number of rings and pi bonds in the molecule.\n*   **Rings:** The product still contains the six-membered cyclohexane ring. So, the number of rings = 1.\n*   **Pi Bonds:** All double bonds (both C=C and C=O) have been reduced to single bonds. So, the number of pi bonds = 0.\n\nIHD of the product = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nThe correct answer is 1, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nAn explanation has already been generated.\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, for the product is calculated.\n\n1.  **Initial Reactant:** 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n2.  **Reaction:** The reaction with red phosphorus and excess HI is a complete reduction. This reaction reduces all multiple bonds (C=C, C=O) to single bonds and removes all oxygen-containing functional groups, converting them to their corresponding alkane parts.\n3.  **Product:**\n    *   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a saturated `cyclohexane` ring.\n    *   The `2-formyl` group (-CHO) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   The `5-vinyl` group (-CH=CH₂) is reduced to an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   The `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   The final product is 1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane.\n4.  **IHD of the Product:** The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency is calculated by the formula: IHD = (number of rings) + (number of pi bonds).\n    *   The product molecule, 1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane, has one ring (the cyclohexane ring).\n    *   It has zero pi bonds as all double bonds have been saturated.\n    *   Therefore, IHD = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nThe IHD of the final product is 1.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, is a calculation that determines the total number of rings and pi bonds within a molecule. The formula for IHD is:\nIHD = C - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 + 1\nwhere C, H, X, and N are the number of carbon, hydrogen, halogen, and nitrogen atoms, respectively. Oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation.\n\n**1. Identify the Reactant and Reagents:**\n*   **Reactant:** 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus and excess hydriodic acid (Red P / HI).\n\n**2. Determine the Molecular Formula of the Reactant:**\n*   The parent structure is `cyclohex-3-ene`: a 6-carbon ring with one double bond.\n*   Substituents are:\n    *   `carboxylic acid` (-COOH): adds 1 C, 1 H, and 2 O.\n    *   `formyl` group (-CHO): adds 1 C, 1 H, and 1 O.\n    *   `vinyl` group (-CH=CH₂): adds 2 C and 3 H.\n*   Let's count the atoms:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (in the ring) + 1 (in -COOH) + 1 (in -CHO) + 2 (in -CH=CH₂) = 10 carbons.\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (in -COOH) + 1 (in -CHO) = 3 oxygens.\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** A saturated 6-membered ring would have 12 hydrogens (C₆H₁₂). The double bond in the ring removes 2 H. Attaching the four substituents removes 4 H. So, H on the ring is 12 - 2 - 4 = 6. The hydrogens from the substituents are 1 (in -COOH), 1 (in -CHO), and 3 (in the vinyl group). Total H = 6 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 11. Let's re-verify H count by drawing the structure.\n        *   C1(COOH), C2(CHO), C3=C4, C5(Vinyl), C6.\n        *   H at C1=1, H at C2=1, H at C3=1, H at C4=1, H at C5=1, H at C6=2. Ring H = 7.\n        *   H in COOH = 1. H in CHO = 1. H in Vinyl(-CH=CH₂) = 3.\n        *   Total H = 7 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12.\n    *   The molecular formula of the reactant is **C₁₀H₁₂O₃**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Reaction:**\nThe combination of red phosphorus and excess HI is a very strong reducing agent. It will:\n*   Reduce aldehydes and carboxylic acids completely to alkane groups. (-CHO → -CH₃; -COOH → -CH₃).\n*   Reduce all carbon-carbon double bonds to single bonds (C=C → C-C).\n*   Remove all oxygen atoms from the molecule.\n*   The ring structure remains intact.\n\n**4. Determine the Product's Structure and Molecular Formula:**\n*   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring is hydrogenated to a `cyclohexane` ring.\n*   The `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The `formyl` group (-CHO) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The `vinyl` group (-CH=CH₂) is hydrogenated to an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n*   The carbon skeleton of C₁₀ remains the same.\n*   The resulting product is a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon (a substituted cyclohexane). The general formula for a cycloalkane is CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   Since there are 10 carbon atoms (n=10), the molecular formula of the product is **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\n**5. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product:**\n*   Using the molecular formula C₁₀H₂₀:\n    IHD = C - H/2 + 1 = 10 - (20/2) + 1 = 10 - 10 + 1 = 1.\n\n*   Alternatively, from the product's structure: The product is a cyclohexane ring with substituents. It contains **one ring** and **zero pi bonds**. Each ring contributes 1 to the IHD. Therefore, the IHD is 1.\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the final product is 1.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the structure of the reactant\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down its structure based on the name:\n*   **cyclohex-**: The molecule has a six-membered carbon ring.\n*   **-carboxylic acid**: There is a principal functional group, -COOH, attached to the ring. By IUPAC convention, its position is C1.\n*   **-3-ene**: There is a carbon-carbon double bond (a π-bond) in the ring between C3 and C4.\n*   **2-formyl**: An aldehyde group (-CHO) is attached to C2 of the ring. This group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (a π-bond).\n*   **5-vinyl**: A vinyl group (-CH=CH2) is attached to C5 of the ring. This group contains a carbon-carbon double bond (a π-bond).\nThe -COOH group itself also contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (a π-bond).\n\nSo, structurally, the reactant molecule contains:\n*   1 ring.\n*   4 π-bonds (one in the cyclohexene ring, one in the vinyl group, one in the formyl group, and one in the carboxylic acid group).\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the reactant is the sum of rings and π-bonds, which is 1 (ring) + 4 (π-bonds) = 5.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the chemical reaction and the transformation\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus (Red P) and excess HI**. This is a very strong reducing agent. It performs the following reductions:\n*   Reduces all carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n*   Reduces all carbonyl groups (C=O) in aldehydes and carboxylic acids completely to alkane parts (CH2 or CH3).\n*   Specifically, R-CHO is reduced to R-CH3.\n*   Specifically, R-COOH is reduced to R-CH3.\n\nIn essence, all π-bonds in the molecule are removed, and all oxygen atoms are eliminated. The carbon skeleton, including the ring, remains intact.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the structure of the product\nApplying the effects of the Red P/HI reduction to our reactant:\n*   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a saturated `cyclohexane` ring. The π-bond in the ring is gone.\n*   The `2-formyl` group (-CHO) becomes a methyl group (-CH3). The C=O π-bond is gone.\n*   The `5-vinyl` group (-CH=CH2) becomes an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The C=C π-bond is gone.\n*   The `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) becomes a methyl group (-CH3). The C=O π-bond is gone.\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane molecule. All functional groups containing π-bonds have been fully saturated. The only feature contributing to the index of hydrogen deficiency is the ring structure itself.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency is given by the formula:\nIHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π-bonds)\n\nFor the product molecule:\n*   Number of rings = 1 (the cyclohexane ring is preserved).\n*   Number of π-bonds = 0 (all double bonds were reduced).\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the product is:\nIHD = 1 + 0 = 1\n\nAlternatively, we can determine the molecular formula of the product.\n*   Reactant C atoms: 6 (ring) + 1 (COOH) + 1 (CHO) + 2 (vinyl) = 10 carbons.\n*   The reaction does not change the number of carbon atoms. So, the product has 10 carbons.\n*   The product is a substituted cyclohexane, which is a saturated monocyclic alkane. The general formula for such compounds is CnH2n.\n*   With n=10, the product's molecular formula is C10H20.\n*   Using the IHD formula for a molecular formula (C_c H_h O_o N_n X_x):\n    IHD = c - h/2 + n/2 + 1\n    IHD = 10 - 20/2 + 0/2 + 1 = 10 - 10 + 1 = 1.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\n**1. Analyze the Reactant**\n\nFirst, let's determine the structure and molecular formula of the reactant, 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: This is a six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbon-3 and carbon-4.\n*   **carboxylic acid**: A -COOH group is attached to the ring. By convention, this is at position C1.\n*   **2-formyl**: A formyl group (-CHO) is attached at position C2.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A vinyl group (-CH=CH2) is attached at position C5.\n\nLet's determine the molecular formula by counting the atoms:\n*   **Carbon (C)**:\n    *   6 carbons in the cyclohexene ring.\n    *   1 carbon in the carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   1 carbon in the formyl group (-CHO).\n    *   2 carbons in the vinyl group (-CH=CH2).\n    *   Total Carbon atoms = 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10.\n*   **Hydrogen (H)**:\n    *   H on C1: 1\n    *   H on C2: 1\n    *   H on C3: 1\n    *   H on C4: 1\n    *   H on C5: 1\n    *   H on C6: 2\n    *   H in -COOH: 1\n    *   H in -CHO: 1\n    *   H in -CH=CH2: 3\n    *   Total Hydrogen atoms = (1+1+1+1+1+2) + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12.\n*   **Oxygen (O)**:\n    *   2 oxygens in the carboxylic acid group.\n    *   1 oxygen in the formyl group.\n    *   Total Oxygen atoms = 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nSo, the molecular formula of the reactant is **C10H12O3**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\nThe reagent used is **Red Phosphorus with excess HI (Hydroiodic acid)**. This is a very powerful reducing agent combination known for its ability to carry out complete reduction. It reduces most oxygen-containing functional groups and unsaturations (double/triple bonds) to their corresponding saturated alkane form.\n\nHere's how it will affect the reactant:\n*   The **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)** at C1 will be reduced to a **methyl group (-CH3)**.\n*   The **formyl group (-CHO)** at C2 will be reduced to a **methyl group (-CH3)**.\n*   The **double bond in the cyclohexene ring (C3=C4)** will be reduced to a **single bond (C3-C4)**, making the ring a cyclohexane.\n*   The **vinyl group (-CH=CH2)** at C5 will be reduced to an **ethyl group (-CH2-CH3)**.\n\n**3. Determine the Product**\n\nBased on the reductions above, the carbon skeleton remains the same (a six-membered ring with substituents), but all functional groups and double bonds are saturated.\nThe product will be **1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane**.\n\nNow, let's find the molecular formula of the product:\n*   **Carbon (C)**: The number of carbon atoms does not change during this reduction. So, C = 10.\n*   **Hydrogen (H)**: The product is a substituted cycloalkane. A monocyclic alkane (a compound with one ring and no double or triple bonds) has the general formula **CnH2n**.\n    *   Since n = 10, the number of hydrogen atoms will be 2 * 10 = 20.\n*   **Oxygen (O)**: All oxygen atoms are removed during the reduction. So, O = 0.\n\nThe molecular formula of the product is **C10H20**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), or degree of unsaturation, tells us the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule. The formula is:\nIHD = C - (H/2) + 1 (for molecules with C, H, and O)\n\nUsing the molecular formula of the product (C10H20):\nIHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1\nIHD = 10 - 10 + 1\nIHD = 1\n\nAlternatively, we can determine the IHD by examining the structure of the product, 1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane.\n*   Number of rings = 1 (the cyclohexane ring)\n*   Number of double bonds = 0\n*   Number of triple bonds = 0\n\nIHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nBoth methods confirm that the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nThe user wants to find the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product formed from the reaction of 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid with red phosphorus and excess HI.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the reactant.**\nThe reactant is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: A six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between C3 and C4.\n*   **carboxylic acid**: A -COOH group. By convention, this is at position C1.\n*   **2-formyl**: A -CHO group at position C2.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A -CH=CH2 group at position C5.\n\nLet's find its molecular formula to calculate the initial IHD.\n*   Carbons (C): 6 (in the ring) + 1 (in -COOH) + 1 (in -CHO) + 2 (in -CH=CH2) = 10 carbons.\n*   Oxygens (O): 2 (in -COOH) + 1 (in -CHO) = 3 oxygens.\n*   Hydrogens (H): Let's count them on the skeleton:\n    *   H at C1: 1\n    *   H at C2: 1\n    *   H at C3: 1\n    *   H at C4: 1\n    *   H at C5: 1\n    *   H at C6: 2\n    *   H in -COOH: 1\n    *   H in -CHO: 1\n    *   H in -CH=CH2: 3\n    *   Total Hydrogens = 1+1+1+1+1+2+1+1+3 = 12 hydrogens.\nThe molecular formula of the reactant is **C10H12O3**.\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) is calculated using the formula: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2).\nIHD(reactant) = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 11 - 6 = 5.\nAlternatively, we can count rings and pi bonds: 1 (ring) + 1 (ring C=C) + 1 (vinyl C=C) + 1 (acid C=O) + 1 (formyl C=O) = 5.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the reaction.**\nThe reagent is **Red Phosphorus with an excess of HI**. This combination is a very strong reducing agent. It performs an exhaustive reduction of the molecule.\n*   It reduces all oxygen-containing functional groups to alkanes.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   The formyl group (-CHO) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   It reduces all carbon-carbon multiple bonds to single bonds.\n    *   The C=C double bond in the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a C-C single bond.\n    *   The C=C double bond in the vinyl group is reduced to a C-C single bond.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure and formula of the product.**\nThe reaction removes all the oxygen atoms and saturates all the double bonds. The original carbon skeleton, including the ring, remains intact.\n*   The C10 carbon skeleton is preserved.\n*   The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring.\n*   The formyl group (at C2) becomes a methyl group.\n*   The carboxylic acid group (at C1) becomes a methyl group.\n*   The vinyl group (at C5) becomes an ethyl group.\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane. Since all double bonds have been saturated, the only feature contributing to hydrogen deficiency is the single ring.\n\nThe product is a saturated monocyclic alkane with 10 carbon atoms.\nA non-cyclic saturated alkane with 10 carbons (decane) would have the formula CnH2n+2 = C10H22.\nSince our product has one ring, its formula will be CnH2n = **C10H20**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of the product.**\nWe can calculate the IHD of the product in two ways:\n1.  **By structure:** The product contains one ring and zero pi bonds. Therefore, IHD = 1 + 0 = 1.\n2.  **By molecular formula (C10H20):**\n    IHD(product) = C + 1 - (H/2)\n    IHD(product) = 10 + 1 - (20/2)\n    IHD(product) = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the final product.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactant**\n\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down its structure to understand its components and calculate its initial IHD.\n\n*   **Cyclohex-3-ene**: This is a six-membered carbon ring containing one carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Carboxylic acid**: This is a -COOH group attached to the ring. It contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n*   **Formyl**: This is a -CHO group (an aldehyde) attached to the ring.

Let's break down this name to determine its structure and molecular formula.\n    *   `cyclohex`: This indicates a six-membered carbon ring.\n    *   `-3-ene`: There is a double bond between carbon 3 and carbon 4 of the ring.\n    *   `carboxylic acid`: A -COOH group is present. By convention, this is at position C1.\n    *   `2-formyl`: An aldehyde group (-CHO) is attached to C2.\n    *   `5-vinyl`: A vinyl group (-CH=CH2) is attached to C5.\n\n    Based on this structure, let's determine its molecular formula.\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 in the ring + 1 in the -COOH group + 1 in the -CHO group + 2 in the -CH=CH2 group = 10 carbons. So, C=10.\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** We can count them systematically. The cyclohexane ring with one double bond (cyclohexene) has the formula C6H10. We replace H atoms with substituents.\n        *   An H is removed from C1 to attach -COOH.\n        *   An H is removed from C2 to attach -CHO.\n        *   An H is removed from C5 to attach -CH=CH2.\n        *   The base ring is C6H7 (10 H in cyclohexene - 3 H replaced).\n        *   Now add hydrogens from the substituents: 1 in -COOH, 1 in -CHO, and 3 in -CH=CH2.\n        *   Total H = 7 (on ring) + 1 (from COOH) + 1 (from CHO) + 3 (from vinyl) = 12 hydrogens.

O = 0.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is C10H20.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product:**\n    The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, indicates the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The formula for IHD is:\n    IHD = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1\n    (Where C is the number of carbons, H is hydrogens, and N is nitrogens.

Understand the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, represents the number of pairs of hydrogen atoms that would need to be added to a molecule to make it saturated and acyclic. It can be calculated using the following rule:\n\n*   IHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds)\n\n**2. Analyze the Structure of the Reactant**\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down its structure to find its IHD.\n\n*   **`cyclohex`**: This indicates the presence of one ring. (Contribution to IHD = 1)\n*   **`-3-ene`**: This indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (a pi bond) within the ring. (Contribution to IHD = 1)\n*   **`carboxylic acid`**: The -COOH group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), which is a pi bond. (Contribution to IHD = 1)\n*   **`formyl`**: The -CHO group (an aldehyde) contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), which is a pi bond. (Contribution to IHD = 1)\n*   **`vinyl`**: The -CH=CH2 group contains a carbon-carbon double bond (a pi bond). (Contribution to IHD = 1)\n\nSo, the total IHD of the reactant is the sum of these contributions:\nIHD (reactant) = 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C in ring) + 1 (C=O in acid) + 1 (C=O in aldehyde) + 1 (C=C in vinyl) = **5**\n\nAlternatively, we can determine the molecular formula of the reactant:\n*   The carbon skeleton has 6 carbons in the ring, 1 in the carboxyl group, 1 in the formyl group, and 2 in the vinyl group, for a total of C=10.\n*   Counting the hydrogens: The structure is C10H12O3.\n*   Using the IHD formula IHD = C + 1 - (H/2) = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 11 - 6 = 5. This confirms our structural analysis.\n\n**3. Understand the Reaction**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess HI (Red P + HI)**. This reagent combination is a very powerful reducing agent. Its effect is to:\n\n*   Reduce all carbon-carbon multiple bonds (C=C, C≡C) to single bonds (C-C).\n*   Reduce all oxygen-containing functional groups (like carboxylic acids, aldehydes, ketones, alcohols) completely to the corresponding alkane. For example, -COOH and -CHO are both reduced to -CH3.\n*   Crucially, this reaction **does not break open saturated rings** (cycloalkanes).\n\n**4. Determine the Structure and IHD of the Product**\n\nLet's see what happens to each part of the reactant molecule that contributes to the IHD:\n\n*   **Ring**: The cyclohexane ring remains intact. So, the product will still have one ring.\n*   **Pi Bonds**: All four pi bonds in the reactant (one C=C in the ring, one C=C in the vinyl group, one C=O in the acid, and one C=O in the aldehyde) are reduced to single bonds.\n\nTherefore, for the product molecule:\n*   Number of rings = 1\n*   Number of pi bonds = 0\n\nNow, we calculate the IHD of the product:\nIHD (product) = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds) = 1 + 0 = **1**\n\nThe final product will be a substituted cyclohexane (specifically, 1-ethyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohexane, though the exact name is not needed). Its molecular formula is C10H20.\nLet's verify the IHD with the product's formula:\nIHD = C + 1 - (H/2) = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\nHere is a step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactant:**\n    The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's determine its structure and its index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD). The IHD (or degree of unsaturation) is a count of the number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n\n    *   **Structure breakdown:**\n        *   `cyclohex-3-ene`: This is a six-membered ring containing one carbon-carbon double bond. This accounts for **one ring** and **one pi bond**.\n        *   `carboxylic acid` (-COOH): This group contains one carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This accounts for **one pi bond**.\n        *   `formyl` (-CHO): This is an aldehyde group, which contains one carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O). This accounts for **one pi bond**.\n        *   `vinyl` (-CH=CH2): This group contains one carbon-carbon double bond. This accounts for **one pi bond**.\n\n    *   **Calculate the IHD of the reactant:**\n        Summing up the contributions:\n        IHD(reactant) = 1 (from the ring) + 1 (from C=C in ring) + 1 (from C=O in acid) + 1 (from C=O in formyl) + 1 (from C=C in vinyl) = 5.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction:**\n    The reactant is treated with red phosphorus (Red P) and an excess of hydriodic acid (HI). This combination is a very powerful and well-known reducing agent in organic chemistry.\n\n    *   **Effect of Red P + HI:** This reagent combination is capable of the complete reduction of most oxygen-containing functional groups and carbon-carbon multiple bonds.\n        *   It reduces carboxylic acids (-COOH) and aldehydes (-CHO) completely to alkyl groups (-CH3). This involves the reduction of the C=O bonds.\n        *   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n        *   It does not, under typical conditions, break open a stable cycloalkane ring.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of the Product:**\n    The reaction will reduce all the unsaturations (pi bonds) in the starting material but will leave the carbon ring intact.\n\n    *   The C=C bond in the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a C-C bond, making it a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The C=C bond in the vinyl group is reduced, converting it to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n    *   The C=O bond in the carboxylic acid is reduced, and the entire group is converted to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   The C=O bond in the formyl group is reduced, and the entire group is converted to a methyl group (-CH3).\n\n    The final product is a substituted cyclohexane. It is a saturated molecule containing one ring system.\n\n4.  **Calculate the IHD of the Product:**\n    We can determine the IHD of the product in two ways:\n\n    *   **Method 1: Change in IHD**\n        The reaction removes all four pi bonds from the reactant. The ring structure is preserved.\n        IHD(product) = IHD(reactant) - (Number of pi bonds reduced)\n        IHD(product) = 5 - 4\n        IHD(product) = 1\n        This remaining degree of unsaturation corresponds to the single ring in the product molecule.\n\n    *   **Method 2: From the Product's Molecular Formula**\n        Let's determine the molecular formula of the product. First, find the number of carbon atoms in the reactant:\n        - Cyclohexene ring: 6 C\n        - Carboxylic acid group: 1 C\n        - Formyl group: 1 C\n        - Vinyl group: 2 C\n        - Total carbons = 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10 C.\n        The reaction does not change the number of carbon atoms. The product is a saturated monocyclic alkane (a substituted cyclohexane) with 10 carbon atoms. The general formula for a monocyclic alkane is CnH2n.\n        Therefore, the molecular formula of the product is C10H(2*10) = **C10H20**.\n        Now, calculate the IHD for C10H20 using the formula IHD = C - H/2 + 1:\n        IHD = 10 - (20 / 2) + 1\n        IHD = 10 - 10 + 1\n        IHD = 1\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Both methods confirm that the index of hydrogen deficiency of the final product is 1. This corresponds to the presence of the cyclohexane ring.

The C=O bond is removed.\n*   **Cyclohex-3-ene ring:** The carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) within the ring will be hydrogenated (reduced) to a carbon-carbon single bond (C-C). The ring itself, being a cyclic structure, remains.\n*   **Vinyl group (-CH=CH₂):** The carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) in the vinyl group will be reduced to a single bond, converting the vinyl group into an ethyl group (-CH₂-CH₃).\n\n### **3. Determine the Structure and IHD of the Product**\n\n*   The original `cyclohexene` ring becomes a saturated `cyclohexane` ring.\n*   All C=C and C=O double bonds are eliminated.\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, is calculated as:\nIHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds)\n\nLet's calculate the IHD for the final product:\n*   **Number of rings:** The six-membered ring structure is preserved. So, there is **1 ring**.\n*   **Number of pi bonds:** All double bonds (three in total: one C=C in the ring, one C=C in the vinyl group, one C=O in the carboxylic acid, and one C=O in the formyl group were all reduced to single bonds. Therefore, there are **0 pi bonds** in the product.\n\n**IHD of the product = 1 (for the ring) + 0 (for pi bonds) = 1**\n\n### **4.

(This confirms our initial analysis: 1 ring + 1 C=C in ring + 1 C=C in vinyl + 1 C=O in COOH + 1 C=O in CHO = 5)\n\n*   **Product:** The product is a substituted cyclohexane (5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane). It is a saturated cycloalkane. A saturated hydrocarbon with 10 carbons and one ring would have the formula CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   Formula: C₁₀H₂₀\n    *   IHD (Product) = C + 1 - (H/2) = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\nBoth methods yield an IHD of 1 for the product.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\nThe final product is C10H20.

This IHD of 1 is due to the single ring present in the cyclohexane structure of the product.\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\n**1. Understand the Reactant and its Structure**\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down this name to draw the structure and find its molecular formula.\n\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: This is a six-membered carbon ring with one double bond between carbon 3 and carbon 4.\n*   **carboxylic acid**: This is the principal functional group (-COOH), so its carbon is designated as C1 on the ring.\n*   **2-formyl**: An aldehyde group (-CHO) is attached to C2 of the ring.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A vinyl group (-CH=CH2) is attached to C5 of the ring.\n\nLet's determine the molecular formula of the reactant:\n*   **Carbon (C)**: 6 carbons in the ring + 1 carbon in the -COOH group + 1 carbon in the -CHO group + 2 carbons in the -CH=CH2 group = **10 carbons (C10)**.\n*   **Hydrogen (H)**:\n    *   On the ring: C1(H), C2(H), C3(H), C4(H), C5(H), C6(H2) -> 7 H\n    *   In the substituents: -COOH (1 H), -CHO (1 H), -CH=CH2 (3 H) -> 5 H\n    *   Total Hydrogen = 7 + 5 = **12 hydrogens (H12)**.\n*   **Oxygen (O)**: 2 oxygens in the -COOH group + 1 oxygen in the -CHO group = **3 oxygens (O3)**.\n\nSo, the molecular formula of the reactant is **C10H12O3**.\n\n**2.

This confirms our calculation.\n\n**3. Understand the Reaction**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI (Red P + HI)**. This reagent combination is one of the most powerful reducing agents in organic chemistry. Its key function is to reduce nearly all oxygen-containing functional groups and sites of unsaturation (double/triple bonds) to their corresponding saturated alkanes.\n\n*   All C=C double bonds will be reduced to C-C single bonds.\n*   All C=O double bonds (in aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids) will be fully reduced.\n*   The overall effect is the conversion of the molecule to its corresponding saturated alkane, preserving the original carbon skeleton.\n\n**4. Determine the Product**\n\nThe reaction will cause the following changes to the reactant molecule:\n*   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring.\n*   The `-COOH` group at C1 is reduced to a `-CH3` group.\n*   The `-CHO` group at C2 is reduced to a `-CH3` group.\n*   The `-CH=CH2` group at C5 is reduced to an ethyl group (`-CH2CH3`).\n\nThe product will be a substituted cyclohexane. The number of carbon atoms remains the same (C10). All oxygen atoms are removed, and all double bonds are saturated with hydrogen. The resulting molecule is a saturated cycloalkane.\n\nThe chemical formula for a saturated alkane is CnH(2n+2). A molecule with one ring will have two fewer hydrogens, so its formula is CnH2n.\n\nSince the product has 10 carbon atoms and a single ring structure, its molecular formula will be **C10H20**.\n\n**5. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nNow we calculate the IHD for the product with the formula C10H20.\n\nUsing the IHD formula:\nIHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2) = 11 - 10 = **1**.\n\nAlternatively, we can look at the structure of the product (an alkyl-substituted cyclohexane). The only feature contributing to the IHD is the presence of the ring itself. A single ring always corresponds to an IHD of 1. All other sources of unsaturation from the reactant have been eliminated by the reduction.\n\nInitial IHD = 5\nThe reduction removes four degrees of unsaturation:\n1.  C=C in the ring\n2.  C=C in the vinyl group\n3.  C=O in the carboxylic acid\n4.  C=O in the aldehyde\nFinal IHD = Initial IHD - 4 = 5 - 4 = **1**.\n\nBoth methods give the same result.\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\nHere's the detailed thought process to arrive at the solution.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Reactant's Name and Structure:**\n    *   The reactant is \"2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid\".\n    *   **Core Structure:** `cyclohex-3-ene` -> A six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbon 3 and carbon 4. This structure contributes 1 ring and 1 pi bond.\n    *   **Main Functional Group:** `carboxylic acid` (-COOH) -> This is at position 1. It contains a C=O double bond, contributing 1 pi bond.\n    *   **Substituent 1:** `2-formyl` -> A formyl group (-CHO) is an aldehyde. It's at position 2 and contains a C=O double bond, contributing 1 pi bond.\n    *   **Substituent 2:** `5-vinyl` -> A vinyl group (-CH=CH2) is at position 5. It contains a C=C double bond, contributing 1 pi bond.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Reactant:**\n    The IHD (also known as the degree of unsaturation) is the sum of rings and pi bonds.\n    *   1 ring (from cyclohexane)\n    *   1 pi bond (from cyclohex-3-ene)\n    *   1 pi bond (from carboxylic acid's C=O)\n    *   1 pi bond (from formyl group's C=O)\n    *   1 pi bond (from vinyl group's C=C)\n    *   Total IHD of Reactant = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n\n3.  **Understand the Reaction:**\n    *   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus and excess of HI (hydroiodic acid).\n    *   **Function:** This combination is a very strong reducing agent. It performs the complete reduction of most oxygen-containing functional groups and multiple bonds to their corresponding alkanes.\n    *   **What gets reduced?**\n        *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3). This removes the C=O pi bond.\n        *   The formyl group (-CHO) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3). This removes the C=O pi bond.\n        *   The double bond in the cyclohexene ring (-C=C-) will be reduced to a single bond (-C-C-). This removes the C=C pi bond in the ring.\n        *   The double bond in the vinyl group (-CH=CH2) will be reduced to an ethyl group (-CH2-CH3). This removes the C=C pi bond in the vinyl group.\n    *   **What remains?**\n        *   The carbon skeleton, including the six-membered ring, remains intact. The ring itself is not opened by this reaction.\n\n4.  **Determine the Structure of the Product:**\n    The original C10 carbon skeleton is preserved, but all pi bonds are removed, and all oxygen atoms are replaced with hydrogens. The product is a saturated alkane with a single ring.\n    *   The `cyclohexene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring.\n    *   The product is a substituted cyclohexane. Since all functional groups and double bonds are reduced, the final molecule is a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon.\n\n5.  **Calculate the IHD of the Product:**\n    The IHD of the final product can be found by looking at its structure.\n    *   Number of rings: 1 (the cyclohexane ring).\n    *   Number of pi bonds: 0 (all have been reduced).\n    *   Total IHD of Product = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the final product is 1.\n\nThis logic can be confirmed with a simple calculation as well.\nThe product is a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon (a cycloalkane). The general formula for a cycloalkane is CₙH₂ₙ. From the initial structure, we have 10 carbon atoms (6 in the ring, 1 in COOH, 1 in CHO, 2 in vinyl). This C₁₀ skeleton is preserved. So, the product's formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n\nUsing the IHD formula:\nIHD = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1\nIHD = 10 - (20/2) + 0 + 1\nIHD = 10 - 10 + 1\nIHD = 1\n\nThus, the index of hydrogen deficiency is 1.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 59:\nHere is a step-by-step thinking process to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Reactant Molecule**\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down this IUPAC name to understand its structure and molecular formula.\n\n*   **Parent Structure:** \"cyclohex-3-ene\" indicates a six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between the 3rd and 4th carbon atoms.\n*   **Principal Functional Group:** \"carboxylic acid\" (-COOH) is the highest priority group, so it is located at carbon C1.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   \"2-formyl\": A formyl group (-CHO) is attached to C2.\n    *   \"5-vinyl\": A vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) is attached to C5.\n\nFrom this structure, let's determine the molecular formula of the reactant.\n\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 in the ring + 1 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO + 2 in -CH=CH₂ = **10 carbons**.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO = **3 oxygens**.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** Instead of manually counting hydrogens, which can be prone to error, we can use the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the reactant to find the hydrogen count. A saturated, non-cyclic alkane with 10 carbons would have the formula C₁₀H₂₂. Let's calculate the IHD from the known unsaturations in the reactant structure:\n    *   1 for the ring structure.\n    *   1 for the double bond in the ring (-3-ene).\n    *   1 for the carbonyl double bond (C=O) in the carboxylic acid.\n    *   1 for the carbonyl double bond (C=O) in the formyl group.\n    *   1 for the double bond in the vinyl group.\n    *   **Total IHD of Reactant = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5**.\n*   Each degree of unsaturation removes two hydrogen atoms from the saturated formula. So, the number of hydrogens is 22 - (2 * 5) = 12.\n*   Thus, the molecular formula of the reactant is **C₁₀H₁₂O₃**.\n\n### **2. Understand the Chemical Reaction**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of HI** (hydroiodic acid).\n\n*   This is a very powerful reducing agent combination in organic chemistry.\n*   Its primary function is to completely reduce oxygen-containing functional groups and unsaturation (double and triple bonds) to the corresponding saturated hydrocarbon (alkane).\n*   Specifically:\n    *   Carboxylic acid (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   Aldehyde/Formyl group (-CHO) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   All carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) are reduced to single bonds (C-C) by the addition of hydrogen.\n    *   All oxygen atoms are removed from the molecule.\n\n### **3. Determine the Product's Structure and Formula**\n\n*   The reaction does not add or remove any carbon atoms, so the product will also have **10 carbon atoms**.\n*   The reaction converts the reactant into a fully saturated hydrocarbon, while preserving the ring structure.\n*   The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring. The substituents are converted to saturated alkyl groups.\n*   The product is a substituted cyclohexane. Any molecule with a single ring and no multiple bonds is a **cycloalkane**.\n*   The general molecular formula for a cycloalkane is **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n*   Since our product has 10 carbon atoms (n=10), its molecular formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n\n### **4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (also known as the degree of unsaturation) quantifies the number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule.\n\n*   **Method 1: Using the Molecular Formula (C₁₀H₂₀)**\n    The IHD for a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ is calculated as:\n    IHD = x - (y/2) + 1\n    IHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1\n    IHD = 10 - 10 + 1\n    IHD = 1\n\n*   **Method 2: Using the Structure**\n    The product is a substituted cyclohexane. By definition, its structure contains:\n    *   Number of rings = 1\n    *   Number of pi bonds (double or triple bonds) = 0\n    IHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds)\n    IHD = 1 + 0\n    IHD = 1\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of the product is 1.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 1\nB) 5 (This is the IHD of the reactant)\nC) 3\nD) 0 (This would be an acyclic, saturated alkane)\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 60:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Reactant\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down its structure to understand its components and calculate its Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) for context.\n\n*   **Parent Structure**: `cyclohex-3-ene`. This is a six-membered ring containing one double bond (C=C). A ring itself contributes 1 to the IHD, and a double bond contributes another 1.\n*   **Substituents**:\n    1.  `carboxylic acid` (-COOH): This group contains a carbonyl (C=O) double bond, which contributes 1 to the IHD. It is at position 1.\n    2.  `formyl` (-CHO): This is an aldehyde group, which contains a carbonyl (C=O) double bond. This contributes 1 to the IHD. It is at position 2.\n    3.  `vinyl` (-CH=CH₂): This group contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), which contributes 1 to the IHD. It is at position 5.\n\nLet's calculate the IHD of the reactant:\n*   From the ring structure: 1\n*   From the C=C double bond in the ring: 1\n*   From the C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid: 1\n*   From the C=O double bond in the formyl group: 1\n*   From the C=C double bond in the vinyl group: 1\n*   **Total IHD of the reactant = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.**\n\nThis corresponds to option A, which is a potential trap for those who calculate the IHD of the reactant instead of the product.\n\nTo confirm this, let's determine the molecular formula of the reactant: **C₁₀H₁₂O₃**.\nUsing the IHD formula: `IHD = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1` (oxygen atoms don't affect the calculation).\n`IHD = 10 - 12/2 + 1 = 10 - 6 + 1 = 5`. This confirms our structural analysis.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Reaction\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI)**. This combination is a very powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry.\n\nThe function of Red P/HI is to perform exhaustive reduction. It reduces almost all oxygen-containing functional groups and carbon-carbon multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated alkanes.\n\n*   **Carboxylic acids (-COOH)** are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   **Aldehydes (-CHO)** are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   **Carbon-carbon double bonds (-C=C-)** are reduced to single bonds (-CH-CH-).\n*   **Carbonyl groups (C=O)** are reduced to methylene groups (-CH₂-).\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Structure of the Product\n\nApplying the effects of the reducing agent to our reactant:\n\n1.  The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring (the double bond is reduced).\n2.  The `-COOH` group at position 1 is reduced to a `-CH₃` (methyl) group.\n3.  The `-CHO` group at position 2 is reduced to a `-CH₃` (methyl) group.\n4.  The `-CH=CH₂` (vinyl) group at position 5 is reduced to a `-CH₂-CH₃` (ethyl) group.\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane. Specifically, it is **1-ethyl-2,5-dimethylcyclohexane** (after re-numbering according to IUPAC rules, though the exact name is not necessary for the solution).\n\nThe key features of the product are:\n*   It contains a single ring (the cyclohexane ring).\n*   All bonds within the structure are single bonds (it is a saturated molecule).\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of the Product\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) or degree of unsaturation is calculated based on the presence of rings or multiple bonds.\n\n*   Rings contribute 1 to the IHD for each ring.\n*   Double bonds contribute 1 to the IHD for each double bond.\n*   Triple bonds contribute 2 to the IHD for each triple bond.\n\nIn our product molecule (a substituted cyclohexane):\n*   Number of rings = 1\n*   Number of double bonds = 0\n*   Number of triple bonds = 0\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the product = 1 + 0 + 0 = **1**.\n\nAlternatively, we can find the molecular formula of the product. The starting material was C₁₀H₁₂O₃. The reduction reaction removes all oxygen atoms and saturates all double bonds, but doesn't change the number of carbon atoms.\n*   **Carbons:** The product still has 10 carbon atoms (C₁₀).\n*   **Hydrogens:** A saturated monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane) has the general formula CₙH₂ₙ. For n=10, the formula is **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\nNow, we use the IHD formula for the product, C₁₀H₂₀:\n`IHD = C - H/2 + 1`\n`IHD = 10 - 20/2 + 1`\n`IHD = 10 - 10 + 1`\n`IHD = 1`\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\nFinal Answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>."
