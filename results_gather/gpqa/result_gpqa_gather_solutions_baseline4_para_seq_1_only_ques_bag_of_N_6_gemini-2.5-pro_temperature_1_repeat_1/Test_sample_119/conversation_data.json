This is a crucial assumption, which means the number density of stars, let's call it `n` (number of stars per unit volume), is constant everywhere in space.\n\n2.  **Relating Parallax to Distance:** Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) to a star. The relationship is given by:\n    `d = 1 / plx`\n    This means that a larger parallax corresponds to a smaller distance, and a smaller parallax corresponds to a larger distance.\n\n3.  **Considering a Volume of Space:** Let's think about the number of stars up to a certain distance `d`. These stars are contained within a sphere of radius `d` centered on the observer. The volume `V` of this sphere is:\n    `V = (4/3) * π * d³`\n\n4.  **Counting Stars in a Shell:** The question asks for the number of stars *per unit range of parallax*. This is a density function. To find it, let's consider the number of stars `dN` in a thin spherical shell at a distance `d` with a small thickness `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this thin shell, `dV`, can be approximated as the surface area of the sphere times its thickness:\n        `dV = (Surface Area) * (thickness) = (4πd²) * dd`\n    *   Since the star density `n` is constant, the number of stars `dN` in this shell is:\n        `dN = n * dV = n * 4πd² * dd`\n\n5.  **Expressing in Terms of Parallax:** Now, we need to convert this expression from being in terms of `d` and `dd` to being in terms of `plx` and `d(plx)`.\n    *   We already have `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   We need to find the relationship between the thickness of the shell `dd` and the corresponding small range in parallax `d(plx)`. We can do this by differentiating the distance-parallax relation:\n        `d(d) / d(plx) = d/d(plx) [1/plx] = -1/plx²`\n    *   This gives us `dd = - (1/plx²) * d(plx)`. The negative sign indicates that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. Since we are counting stars, we are interested in the magnitude, so we can ignore the negative sign.\n        `|dd| = (1/plx²) * |d(plx)|`\n\n6.  **Substituting into the Star Count Equation:** Now substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` back into our equation for `dN`:\n    `dN = n * 4π * (1/plx)² * [ (1/plx²) * d(plx) ]`\n\n7.  **Simplifying the Expression:** Combine the terms involving `plx`:\n    `dN = n * 4π * (1/plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n    This can be rewritten as:\n    `dN / d(plx) = 4πn / plx⁴`\n\n8.  **Final Conclusion:** The term `dN / d(plx)` represents the number of stars per unit range of parallax. Since `4`, `π`, and the stellar density `n` are all constants, we can see the proportionality:\n    `Number of stars per unit parallax range ∝ 1 / plx⁴`\n\nThis means the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to the inverse fourth power of the parallax.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the relationship between distance and parallax.**\n    Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) to a star. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n    `plx = 1/d`\n    This means that the distance `d` can be expressed in terms of parallax as:\n    `d = 1/plx`\n\n2.  **Understand the assumption of uniform distribution.**\n    The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. This means that the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ` (rho), is constant throughout space. `ρ` is the number of stars per unit volume.\n    `ρ = Number of Stars / Volume = constant`\n\n3.  **Calculate the number of stars within a certain distance.**\n    Consider a sphere centered on the observer (Earth) with a radius `d`. The volume `V` of this sphere is:\n    `V = (4/3) * π * d^3`\n    The total number of stars `N` inside this sphere is the density multiplied by the volume:\n    `N = ρ * V = ρ * (4/3) * π * d^3`\n    Since `ρ`, `π`, and `4/3` are constants, the number of stars within a distance `d` is proportional to the cube of the distance:\n    `N ∝ d^3`\n\n4.  **Find the number of stars in a thin spherical shell.**\n    We want to find the number of stars `dN` in a thin spherical shell between distance `d` and `d + dd`. The volume of this shell `dV` is the surface area of the sphere (`4πd^2`) multiplied by the thickness of the shell (`dd`):\n    `dV = 4πd^2 * dd`\n    The number of stars `dN` in this shell is the density `ρ` times the volume of the shell `dV`:\n    `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd^2 * dd`\n    This gives us the number of stars in a specific distance range `[d, d + dd]`.\n\n5.  **Convert the expression to be in terms of parallax.**\n    The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is `dN/d(plx)`. We need to substitute `d` and `dd` in the equation for `dN` with expressions involving `plx`.\n    *   We already have `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   To find `dd`, we differentiate `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d/d(plx) [1/plx] = -1/plx^2`\n        So, `dd = (-1/plx^2) * d(plx)`\n    Now, substitute these into the equation for `dN`:\n    `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx^2 * d(plx))`\n    `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx^2) * (-1/plx^2 * d(plx))`\n    `dN = -4πρ * (1/plx^4) * d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Determine the number of stars per unit parallax.**\n    The number of stars per unit range of parallax is the expression `dN/d(plx)`.\n    `dN/d(plx) = -4πρ / plx^4`\n    The negative sign indicates that as parallax `plx` increases, the corresponding distance `d` decreases, so we are looking at a shell closer to us. The density, or the number of stars in a given small range of parallax, is a positive quantity. We are interested in how the magnitude of this number changes with `plx`.\n    The magnitude is:\n    `|dN/d(plx)| = 4πρ / plx^4`\n    Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are constants, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx^4`.\n    `Number of stars per unit parallax ~ 1/plx^4`\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Define the relationship between key variables:**\n    *   **Uniform distribution:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ` (number of stars per unit volume), is constant throughout space.\n    *   **Parallax (plx):** Parallax is inversely proportional to the distance `d` to a star. We can write this relationship as `plx = k/d` or, for simplicity in astronomical units, `d = 1/plx`.\n\n2.  **Count stars in a volume of space:**\n    *   Let's consider the number of stars `N` up to a certain distance `d`. These stars are contained within a sphere of radius `d`.\n    *   The volume `V` of this sphere is `V = (4/3)πd³`.\n    *   Since the star density `ρ` is constant, the total number of stars `N` within this sphere is `N = ρ * V = ρ * (4/3)πd³`.\n\n3.  **Express the number of stars as a function of parallax:**\n    *   Now, we substitute the relationship `d = 1/plx` into the equation for `N`:\n        `N(plx) = ρ * (4/3)π * (1/plx)³ = (4πρ/3) * (1/plx³)`.\n    *   This equation gives us the total number of stars with a parallax *greater than or equal to* `plx` (since smaller distance `d` corresponds to larger parallax `plx`).\n\n4.  **Find the number of stars per unit range of parallax:**\n    *   The question asks how the *number of stars per unit range of parallax* changes with `plx`. This is a differential quantity, which can be expressed as `dN/d(plx)`.\n    *   We need to differentiate the expression for `N(plx)` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dN/d(plx) = d/d(plx) [ (4πρ/3) * plx⁻³ ]`\n    *   Applying the power rule for differentiation `d(xⁿ)/dx = nxⁿ⁻¹`:\n        `dN/d(plx) = (4πρ/3) * (-3 * plx⁻⁴) = -4πρ * plx⁻⁴ = -4πρ / plx⁴`.\n\n5.  **Interpret the result:**\n    *   The negative sign indicates that as parallax `plx` increases, the cumulative number of stars `N` decreases (which is correct according to our definition of N as the number of stars *beyond* a certain parallax). However, the question is about the number of stars *in a given parallax range*, which is a positive quantity. So we are interested in the magnitude.\n    *   `|dN/d(plx)| = 4πρ / plx⁴`.\n    *   Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are constants, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n    *   Therefore, the relationship is: `dN/d(plx) ~ 1/plx⁴`.\n\n6.  **Match with the given options:**\n    *   A) ~ 1/plx¹\n    *   B) ~ 1/plx²\n    *   C) ~ 1/plx⁴\n    *   D) ~ 1/plx³\n\n    Our derived relationship matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Key Concepts:**\n    *   **Uniform Distribution of Stars:** This is the core assumption. It means that the number of stars per unit volume is constant everywhere in space. Let's call this constant number density `ρ`.\n    *   **Parallax (plx):** Parallax is an angle that is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) of a star. The relationship is given by:\n        `plx = 1/d`\n        This implies that the distance to a star can be expressed as:\n        `d = 1/plx`\n\n2.  **Formulate the Goal:**\n    The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax. In mathematical terms, if `N` is the number of stars, we need to find how the quantity `dN/d(plx)` depends on `plx`.\n\n3.  **Relate the Number of Stars to Distance:**\n    *   Let's consider a thin spherical shell of space centered on the Sun. The shell is at a distance `d` and has a small thickness `dd`.\n    *   The surface area of a sphere with radius `d` is `A = 4πd²`.\n    *   The volume of this thin shell (`dV`) is its surface area multiplied by its thickness:\n        `dV = 4πd² * dd`\n    *   Since the stars are uniformly distributed with density `ρ`, the number of stars (`dN`) within this thin shell is the volume of the shell multiplied by the star density:\n        `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n\n4.  **Translate from Distance to Parallax:**\n    Now, we need to express `dN` in terms of `plx` instead of `d`. We have two substitutions to make:\n    *   First, substitute `d = 1/plx` into the equation:\n        `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * dd`\n    *   Second, we need to relate the thickness of the shell `dd` to the corresponding interval in parallax `d(plx)`. We can do this by differentiating the relation `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd / d(plx) = d/d(plx) [1/plx] = -1/plx²`\n        This gives us `dd = - (1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n    *   The negative sign simply indicates that as distance (`d`) increases, parallax (`plx`) decreases. Since we are interested in the *number* of stars in a given range (which is always positive), we can consider the magnitude:\n        `|dd| = (1/plx²) * |d(plx)|`\n\n5.  **Combine the Expressions:**\n    Now, substitute the expression for `dd` back into the equation for `dN`:\n    `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n    `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Find the Number of Stars per Unit Parallax:**\n    The quantity we are looking for is the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is `dN/d(plx)`. We can find this by rearranging the equation from the previous step:\n    `dN / d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\n7.  **Analyze the Proportionality:**\n    Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, we can see the proportionality:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\n8.  **Conclusion:**\n    The number of stars per unit range of parallax changes as the inverse fourth power of the parallax (`1/plx⁴`). This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the key quantities:**\n    *   **Star Density (ρ):** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed. This means the number of stars per unit volume, ρ, is constant everywhere in space.\n    *   **Distance (d):** The distance from the observer to a star.\n    *   **Parallax (plx):** Parallax is the apparent shift in a star's position due to the Earth's orbit. It is inversely proportional to the distance. The relationship is `plx = 1/d` (where parallax is in arcseconds and distance is in parsecs).\n\n2.  **Count stars in a thin shell of space:**\n    *   Consider a thin spherical shell of radius `d` and thickness `dd`. The volume of this shell (`dV`) is its surface area (`4πd²`) multiplied by its thickness (`dd`).\n    *   `dV = 4πd² * dd`\n    *   Since the star density (ρ) is constant, the number of stars (`dN`) within this thin shell is the density multiplied by the volume.\n    *   `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n\n3.  **Relate the number of stars to parallax:**\n    *   The goal is to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (`dN/d(plx)`) depends on parallax (`plx`).\n    *   We need to express `d` and `dd` in terms of `plx` and `d(plx)`.\n    *   From `plx = 1/d`, we get `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   To find the relationship between `dd` and `d(plx)`, we differentiate `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d(1/plx) / d(plx) = -1/plx²`\n    *   This gives us `dd = - (1/plx²) * d(plx)`. The negative sign indicates that as distance (`d`) increases, parallax (`plx`) decreases. When we are counting stars in a shell, we are only interested in the magnitude of the thickness, so we can ignore the negative sign.\n        `|dd| = (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n\n4.  **Substitute back into the star count equation:**\n    *   We start with our equation for the number of stars in the shell: `dN = ρ * 4πd² * dd`.\n    *   Now, substitute `d = 1/plx` and `dd = (1/plx²) * d(plx)` into this equation.\n        `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n    *   Simplify the expression:\n        `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n        `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n5.  **Find the number of stars per unit parallax:**\n    *   To find the number of stars per unit range of parallax, we divide `dN` by `d(plx)`:\n        `dN / d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n    *   Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, we can see the proportionality:\n        `dN / d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Define the fundamental assumption:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ`, is constant throughout space. `ρ` represents the number of stars per unit volume.\n\n2.  **Relate the number of stars to volume and distance:** Consider a thin spherical shell of space centered on the observer. Let the inner radius of this shell be `d` and the outer radius be `d + dd`.\n    *   The volume of this thin shell (`dV`) is approximately its surface area multiplied by its thickness: `dV = 4πd² dd`.\n    *   The number of stars (`dN`) within this shell is the volume of the shell multiplied by the constant star density `ρ`:\n        `dN = ρ * dV = 4πρd² dd`\n\n3.  **Introduce Parallax (plx):** Parallax is inversely proportional to the distance `d`. The standard astronomical formula is:\n    `plx = 1/d`\n    (where `plx` is in arcseconds and `d` is in parsecs).\n\n4.  **Express `d` and `dd` in terms of `plx`:** We need to find how the number of stars `dN` changes with a change in parallax `d(plx)`. To do this, we must substitute the distance variables (`d`, `dd`) in our equation for `dN` with parallax variables.\n    *   From `plx = 1/d`, we get `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   Now, we need to find the relationship between the thickness of the shell `dd` and the corresponding interval of parallax `d(plx)`. We can find this by differentiating `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `d = (plx)⁻¹`\n        `dd/d(plx) = -1 * (plx)⁻² = -1/plx²`\n        `dd = -(1/plx²) d(plx)`\n\n5.  **Interpret the negative sign:** The negative sign indicates that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. When we are considering the number of stars in a given range (a physical count), it must be a positive quantity. So, we are interested in the magnitude of the relationship:\n    `|dd| = (1/plx²) d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Substitute the parallax expressions back into the equation for `dN`:**\n    *   Our equation is `dN = 4πρd² |dd|`.\n    *   Substitute `d = 1/plx` and `|dd| = (1/plx²) d(plx)`.\n    *   `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) d(plx)`\n    *   `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) d(plx)`\n\n7.  **Find the number of stars per unit range of parallax:** The question asks for \"how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx\". This quantity is mathematically represented as `dN/d(plx)`.\n    *   From the equation in the previous step, we can divide by `d(plx)`:\n        `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\n8.  **Determine the proportionality:** Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, we can see the proportionality relationship:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to the inverse of the parallax to the fourth power.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) ~ 1/plx¹\nB) ~ 1/plx²\nC) ~ 1/plx⁴\nD) ~ 1/plx³\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the fundamental assumption:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ` (number of stars per unit volume), is constant throughout space.\n\n2.  **Consider the number of stars in a volume of space:** Let's think about the number of stars at a certain distance `d` from us. We can imagine a thin spherical shell centered on Earth with radius `d` and a small thickness `dd`.\n    *   The surface area of a sphere with radius `d` is `A = 4 * π * d^2`.\n    *   The volume of the thin shell (`dV`) is approximately its surface area multiplied by its thickness: `dV = A * dd = 4 * π * d^2 * dd`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the number of stars in this shell:** Since the star density `ρ` is constant, the number of stars (`dN`) within this shell is the density multiplied by the volume of the shell:\n    `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * (4 * π * d^2 * dd)`\n\n4.  **Introduce Parallax (plx):** The question asks for the distribution in terms of parallax, not distance. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. For simplicity (and by convention in astronomy), we use the relationship:\n    `plx = 1 / d`  which implies `d = 1 / plx`\n\n5.  **Relate the intervals `dd` and `d(plx)`:** We need to express the small distance interval `dd` in terms of a small parallax interval `d(plx)`. We can do this by taking the derivative of `d` with respect to `plx`:\n    `d = 1 / plx = plx^(-1)`\n    `dd / d(plx) = -1 * plx^(-2) = -1 / plx^2`\n    So, `dd = - d(plx) / plx^2`.\n\n    The negative sign simply means that as distance (`d`) increases, parallax (`plx`) decreases. When we are considering the *number* of stars in an interval, we are interested in the magnitude of the interval. So, we can take the absolute value: `|dd| = d(plx) / plx^2`.\n\n6.  **Substitute `d` and `dd` into the star count equation:** Now we replace the distance-based terms in our equation for `dN` with parallax-based terms.\n    Our starting equation was: `dN = ρ * 4 * π * d^2 * dd`\n    Substitute `d = 1 / plx` and `dd = d(plx) / plx^2`:\n    `dN = ρ * 4 * π * (1 / plx)^2 * (d(plx) / plx^2)`\n    `dN = ρ * 4 * π * (1 / plx^2) * (d(plx) / plx^2)`\n    Combine the terms:\n    `dN = (4 * π * ρ / plx^4) * d(plx)`\n\n7.  **Find the number of stars per unit range of parallax:** The question asks for \"how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx\". This quantity is `dN / d(plx)`. From the equation above, we can divide both sides by `d(plx)`:\n    `dN / d(plx) = 4 * π * ρ / plx^4`\n\n8.  **Determine the proportionality:** Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, the relationship is:\n    **`dN / d(plx) ∝ 1 / plx^4`**\n\nThis shows that the number of stars per unit parallax interval is proportional to the inverse fourth power of the parallax.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Fundamental Assumption:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in space. This implies that the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ`, is constant throughout space.\n\n2.  **Number of Stars in a Volume:** The number of stars `N` in any given volume `V` is simply the density multiplied by the volume: `N = ρ * V`.\n\n3.  **Consider a Shell of Stars:** We are interested in the number of stars at a certain distance. Let's consider a thin spherical shell of stars at a distance `d` from the observer, with a small thickness `dd`. The volume of this thin shell `dV` can be approximated by the surface area of the sphere (`4πd²`) multiplied by its thickness (`dd`).\n    `dV = 4πd² dd`\n\n4.  **Number of Stars in the Shell:** The number of stars `dN` in this thin shell is the density `ρ` times the volume of the shell `dV`.\n    `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * (4πd² dd)`\n\n5.  **Introduce Parallax (plx):** Parallax is defined as the inverse of the distance to the star. For simplicity (using units of parsecs for distance and arcseconds for parallax), the relationship is:\n    `d = 1/plx`\n\n6.  **Relate Differentials `dd` and `d(plx)`:** We need to find how a small change in distance `dd` relates to a small change in parallax `d(plx)`. We can find this by differentiating the parallax equation with respect to `plx`:\n    `d(d)/d(plx) = d(1/plx)/d(plx) = -1/plx²`\n    This gives us the relationship: `dd = - (1/plx²) d(plx)`.\n    Since we are counting stars, `dN` must be a positive number. A positive interval `d(plx)` corresponds to a negative interval `dd` (as distance decreases when parallax increases). We are interested in the number of stars within a parallax range, so we consider the magnitude of the change:\n    `|dd| = (1/plx²) d(plx)`\n\n7.  **Substitute `d` and `dd` into the `dN` equation:** Now we substitute the expressions for `d` and `|dd|` in terms of `plx` into our equation for the number of stars in the shell (`dN = 4πρd² |dd|`).\n    *   Replace `d` with `1/plx`.\n    *   Replace `|dd|` with `(1/plx²) d(plx)`.\n\n    `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) d(plx)`\n\n8.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx⁴) d(plx)`\n\n9.  **Find the Number of Stars per Unit Range of Parallax:** The question asks for how the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is the quantity `dN/d(plx)`, changes with `plx`. We can find this by dividing both sides of our equation by `d(plx)`.\n    `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\n10. **Determine the Proportionality:** Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, we can see the relationship:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the fundamental assumption:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number density of stars, let's call it ρ (rho), is constant everywhere. The number of stars (N) in any given volume (V) is simply N = ρ * V.\n\n2.  **Consider a volume of space:** Let's think about the stars in a thin spherical shell at a distance `d` from us. Let the thickness of this shell be a very small amount, `dd`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the volume of the shell:** The volume of a sphere is V = (4/3)πd³. The surface area of a sphere of radius `d` is A = 4πd². The volume of the thin shell (dV) can be approximated by its surface area multiplied by its thickness:\n    dV = A * dd = 4πd² * dd\n\n4.  **Calculate the number of stars in the shell:** Using our assumption of uniform density ρ, the number of stars (dN) in this thin shell is:\n    dN = ρ * dV = ρ * (4πd² * dd)\n\n5.  **Relate distance (d) to parallax (plx):** Parallax is defined as the inverse of the distance. For simplicity, let's use the standard astronomical units where `plx = 1/d` (with `plx` in arcseconds and `d` in parsecs). From this relationship, we can also express `d` in terms of `plx`:\n    d = 1/plx\n\n6.  **Relate the infinitesimal changes (dd and d(plx)):** We need to find how a small change in distance (`dd`) relates to a small change in parallax (`d(plx)`). We can find this by taking the derivative of the distance equation with respect to parallax:\n    d(d)/d(plx) = d/d(plx) * (1/plx) = -1/plx²\n    Rearranging this gives us the relationship between `dd` and `d(plx)`:\n    dd = (-1/plx²) * d(plx)\n    Since we are counting stars, we are only interested in the magnitude of the change, not the direction (the negative sign just shows that as distance increases, parallax decreases). So we can write:\n    |dd| = (1/plx²) * |d(plx)|\n\n7.  **Substitute parallax into the star count equation:** Now we take our equation for the number of stars in the shell (dN) and replace the distance terms (`d` and `dd`) with their parallax equivalents.\n    Original equation: dN = ρ * 4πd² * dd\n    Substitute d = 1/plx: dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * dd\n    Substitute dd = (1/plx²) * d(plx): dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) * d(plx)\n\n8.  **Simplify the expression:** Combine the terms to get the final relationship between the number of stars `dN` in a small parallax range `d(plx)`:\n    dN = (ρ * 4π / plx⁴) * d(plx)\n\n9.  **Find the number of stars per unit range of parallax:** The question asks for \"the number of stars per unit range of parallax,\" which is mathematically represented as dN/d(plx). We can find this by dividing both sides of our equation by `d(plx)`:\n    dN / d(plx) = ρ * 4π / plx⁴\n\n10. **Determine the proportionality:** In this final expression, ρ, 4, and π are all constants.

It is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) to the star. The relationship is given by:\n    `plx = 1/d`\n    This means that distance can be expressed as:\n    `d = 1/plx`\n\n2.  **Understand the \"uniform distribution of stars\" assumption.**\n    This assumption means that the number density of stars (`ρ`), which is the number of stars per unit volume, is constant everywhere in space.\n\n3.  **Calculate the number of stars in a thin spherical shell.**\n    Let's consider the number of stars (`dN`) in a thin spherical shell of space at a distance `d` from Earth with a small thickness `dd`.\n    *   The volume of a sphere with radius `d` is `V = (4/3)πd³`.\n    *   The volume of the thin shell (`dV`) is the surface area of the sphere (`A = 4πd²`) multiplied by its thickness (`dd`).\n        `dV = 4πd² dd`\n    *   The number of stars (`dN`) in this shell is the density (`ρ`) multiplied by the volume of the shell (`dV`).\n        `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² dd`\n\n4.  **Express the number of stars in terms of parallax.**\n    Our goal is to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (`dN/dplx`) depends on `plx`. To do this, we need to substitute `d` and `dd` with expressions involving `plx`.\n    *   We already have `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   We need to find the relationship between `dd` and `dplx`. We can get this by differentiating `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/dplx = d/dplx (1/plx) = -1/plx²`\n        Therefore, `dd = -dplx / plx²`.\n    *   The negative sign indicates that as distance (`d`) increases, parallax (`plx`) decreases.

Let's consider a thin spherical shell of radius `d` and thickness `dd`. The volume of this shell (`dV`) is its surface area multiplied by its thickness:\n    `dV = (4 * π * d²) * dd`\n\n4.  **Find the number of stars in this shell:** Substituting the volume `dV` into our first equation, the number of stars `dN` in this thin shell is:\n    `dN = ρ * 4 * π * d² * dd`\n\n5.  **Introduce parallax (plx):** The question asks about the number of stars per unit range of parallax (`plx`), not distance (`d`). Parallax is inversely proportional to distance:\n    `d = 1 / plx`\n\n6.  **Relate the differential thickness `dd` to the differential parallax `d(plx)`:** To change our expression from being in terms of `d` and `dd` to `plx` and `d(plx)`, we need to find the relationship between `dd` and `d(plx)`. We can do this by differentiating the parallax-distance relation with respect to `plx`:\n    `dd / d(plx) = d/d(plx) * (1 / plx)`\n    Using the power rule of differentiation, this gives:\n    `dd / d(plx) = -1 / plx²`\n    Therefore, `dd = (-1 / plx²) * d(plx)`.\n\n7.  **Substitute `d` and `dd` into the equation for `dN`:** Now we replace `d` with `1/plx` and `dd` with `(-1 / plx²) * d(plx)` in our equation for the number of stars in the shell (`dN = ρ * 4 * π * d² * dd`):\n    `dN = ρ * 4 * π * (1 / plx)² * ((-1 / plx²) * d(plx))`\n    `dN = - (4 * π * ρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n8.  **Find the number of stars per unit range of parallax:** The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is the quantity `dN / d(plx)`.

This means the number of stars per unit volume is constant throughout space. Let's call this constant number density `ρ`.\n\n2.  **Relating Distance and Parallax:** Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) to a star. The relationship is given by:\n    `d = 1 / plx`\n\n3.  **Counting Stars in a Volume:** We want to find the number of stars (`N`) within a certain volume of space. For a uniform distribution, the number of stars in a given volume (`V`) is simply the volume multiplied by the number density:\n    `N = ρ * V`\n\n4.  **Focusing on a Specific Parallax Range:** The question asks for the number of stars *per unit range of parallax*. This means we need to find how many stars are found in a small interval of parallax, from `plx` to `plx + d(plx)`. This parallax interval corresponds to a specific range of distances.\n\n5.  **Defining the Volume Element:** A small range of parallax `d(plx)` corresponds to a small range of distance `dd`. The stars within this distance range `dd` at a distance `d` will occupy a thin spherical shell.\n    *   The volume of a thin spherical shell of radius `d` and thickness `dd` is given by its surface area multiplied by its thickness: `dV = 4 * π * d² * dd`.\n\n6.  **Calculating the Number of Stars in the Shell:** The number of stars (`dN`) in this thin shell is the volume of the shell (`dV`) multiplied by the constant star density (`ρ`):\n    `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * (4 * π * d² * dd)`\n\n7.  **Expressing the Relationship in Terms of Parallax:** Now, we need to convert our expression from being in terms of distance (`d` and `dd`) to being in terms of parallax (`plx` and `d(plx)`).\n    *   We know `d = 1 / plx`.\n    *   We need to find the relationship between `dd` and `d(plx)`.

So we can write: `|dd| = (1/plx²) * |d(plx)|`.\n\n5.  **Substituting Parallax into the Star Count Equation:** Now we substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` into our equation for `dN`:\n    *   We start with: `dN = ρ * 4 * π * d² * dd`\n    *   Substitute `d = 1/plx`: `dN = ρ * 4 * π * (1/plx)² * dd`\n    *   Substitute `dd = (1/plx²) * d(plx)` (using the magnitude): `dN = ρ * 4 * π * (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n    *   Combine the terms: `dN = (ρ * 4 * π / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Finding the Number of Stars per Unit Parallax Range:** The quantity \"number of stars per unit range of parallax\" is `dN / d(plx)`.\n    *   From our last equation, we can divide both sides by `d(plx)`:\n        `dN / d(plx) = ρ * 4 * π / plx⁴`\n    *   Since `ρ`, `4`, and `π` are all constants, we can see the proportionality:\n        `dN / d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax varies as the inverse fourth power of the parallax.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\n*   **1. Understanding the setup:**\n    *   The problem assumes that stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ`, is constant everywhere. The number density is the number of stars per unit volume.\n    *   `ρ = N/V = constant`\n\n*   **2. Relating the number of stars to distance:**\n    *   Let's consider the number of stars, `N(d)`, within a sphere of radius `d` centered on the observer (Earth).\n    *   The volume of this sphere is `V(d) = (4/3)πd³`.\n    *   Since the density `ρ` is constant, the total number of stars up to a distance `d` is `N(d) = ρ * V(d) = ρ * (4/3)πd³`.\n\n*   **3. Finding the number of stars in a thin shell:**\n    *   We are interested in how the number of stars changes with a property, so we need to consider a small interval. Let's find the number of stars `dN` in a thin spherical shell between distance `d` and `d + dd`.\n    *   This can be found by differentiating `N(d)` with respect to `d`:\n        `dN/dd = d/dd [ρ * (4/3)πd³] = ρ * 4πd²`\n    *   So, the number of stars in the shell of thickness `dd` is:\n        `dN = (ρ * 4πd²) dd`\n    *   This equation tells us that the number of stars in a thin shell at distance `d` is proportional to `d²`.\n\n*   **4. Introducing Parallax:**\n    *   Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance `d`. The standard definition is `plx = 1/d`, where `d` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds.\n    *   From this relationship, we can express `d` in terms of `plx`: `d = 1/plx`.\n\n*   **5. Connecting the differentials of distance and parallax:**\n    *   We need to find how the interval `dd` relates to an interval in parallax, `d(plx)`. We can find this by differentiating the expression `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`.\n    *   `dd / d(plx) = d/d(plx) [1/plx] = -1/plx²`\n    *   Rearranging this gives: `dd = (-1/plx²) d(plx)`\n    *   When considering the number of stars, we are interested in the magnitude of the interval, so we can ignore the negative sign (which just indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases).\n    *   `dd = (1/plx²) d(plx)`\n\n*   **6. Finding the number of stars per unit range of parallax:**\n    *   Now we substitute our expressions for `d` and `dd` back into the equation for `dN` from step 3.\n    *   `dN = (ρ * 4πd²) dd`\n    *   Substitute `d = 1/plx` and `dd = (1/plx²) d(plx)`:\n        `dN = (ρ * 4π * (1/plx)²) * (1/plx²) d(plx)`\n        `dN = (ρ * 4π * 1/plx²) * (1/plx²) d(plx)`\n        `dN = (ρ * 4π / plx⁴) d(plx)`\n\n*   **7. Final result:**\n    *   The question asks for \"how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx\". This is the quantity `dN / d(plx)`.\n    *   From the equation above:\n        `dN / d(plx) = ρ * 4π / plx⁴`\n    *   Since `ρ` (the star density) and `4π` are constants, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n    *   `dN / d(plx) ~ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Key Concepts:**\n    *   **Uniform Distribution of Stars:** This is the core assumption. It means that the number of stars per unit volume is constant throughout space. Let's call this constant number density `ρ`.\n    *   **Parallax (plx):** Parallax is an angular measurement that is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) to a star. For small angles, the relationship is `plx ≈ 1/d`. Therefore, the distance to a star can be expressed as `d ≈ 1/plx`.\n    *   **The Question:** We need to find how \"the number of stars per unit range of parallax\" changes with parallax. This is essentially asking for the distribution function of stars with respect to parallax, which can be written as `dN/d(plx)`, where `N` is the number of stars.\n\n2.  **Relate Number of Stars to Distance:**\n    *   Consider a thin spherical shell of space around the Earth. Let the inner radius of the shell be `d` and the outer radius be `d + dd`, where `dd` is a very small thickness.\n    *   The volume of this thin shell (`dV`) is its surface area multiplied by its thickness: `dV = (4πd²) * dd`.\n    *   Since the stars are uniformly distributed with a density `ρ`, the number of stars (`dN`) within this thin shell is the density multiplied by the volume of the shell:\n        `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd`.\n\n3.  **Convert from Distance to Parallax:**\n    *   Now, we need to express this relationship in terms of parallax (`plx`) instead of distance (`d`). We use the relation `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   We also need to find the relationship between the small thickness `dd` and the corresponding small range of parallax `d(plx)`. We can find this by differentiating `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `d = 1/plx = plx⁻¹`\n        `dd/d(plx) = -1 * plx⁻² = -1/plx²`\n    *   This gives us `dd = -d(plx)/plx²`. The negative sign indicates that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. When we are considering the number of stars in a given range (a magnitude), we can ignore the negative sign. So, `dd = d(plx)/plx²`.\n\n4.  **Substitute and Simplify:**\n    *   Now substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` back into our equation for `dN`:\n        `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (d(plx)/plx²)`\n    *   Let's combine the terms:\n        `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n        `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n5.  **Find the Number of Stars per Unit Parallax:**\n    *   The quantity we are looking for is \"the number of stars per unit range of parallax,\" which is `dN/d(plx)`. We can find this by rearranging the equation from the previous step:\n        `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n    *   Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, we can see the proportionality:\n        `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to the inverse fourth power of the parallax (`1/plx⁴`).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Key Quantities and Assumptions:**\n    *   **Assumption:** Stars are uniformly distributed in space.

This is a crucial starting point. A uniform distribution means that the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ`, is constant everywhere. The number of stars `N` in any given volume `V` is simply `N = ρ * V`.\n\n2.  **Relate the Number of Stars to Distance:** Let's consider a sphere of radius `d` centered on the observer (the Sun). The volume of this sphere is `V = (4/3)πd³`. The total number of stars (`N`) within this distance `d` is:\n    `N(d) = ρ * V = ρ * (4/3)πd³`\n    This shows that the total number of stars up to a certain distance `d` is proportional to the cube of the distance (`N ∝ d³`).\n\n3.  **Introduce Parallax (plx):** Stellar parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) to the star. The relationship is given by:\n    `plx = 1/d`\n    (when `d` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds).\n    From this, we can express the distance in terms of parallax:\n    `d = 1/plx`\n\n4.  **Find the Number of Stars in a Thin Shell:** The question asks for the \"number of stars per unit range of parallax\". This is a rate, which in calculus terms means a derivative. Let's find the number of stars `dN` in a thin spherical shell of space. This shell is between a distance `d` and a slightly larger distance `d + dd`.\n    *   The volume of the thin shell `dV` can be approximated by the surface area of the inner sphere (`4πd²`) times the thickness of the shell (`dd`):\n        `dV = 4πd² * dd`\n    *   The number of stars `dN` in this shell is the density `ρ` times the shell's volume `dV`:\n        `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n\n5.  **Change Variables from Distance to Parallax:** Now we need to express `dN` in terms of parallax `plx`. We have the relationships:\n    *   `d = 1/plx`\n    *   To find the relationship between `dd` and `d(plx)`, we differentiate `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d/d(plx) (1/plx) = -1/plx²`\n        `dd = -(1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n    The negative sign simply indicates that as distance (`d`) increases, parallax (`plx`) decreases. Since we are interested in the number of stars in a range, which must be a positive quantity, we consider the magnitude: `|dd| = (1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n\n6.  **Substitute and Simplify:** Now substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` back into the equation for `dN`:\n    `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n    `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n7.  **Find the Number of Stars per Unit Parallax:** The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is `dN/d(plx)`.

We can do this by taking the derivative of the parallax equation with respect to distance `d`:\n    *   `d(plx)/dd = d(1/d)/dd = -1/d²`\n    *   Rearranging this, we get: `dd = -d² * d(plx)`.\n    *   The negative sign simply indicates that as distance (`d`) increases, parallax (`plx`) decreases.

This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ`, is constant everywhere in space.\n\n2.  **Relate the number of stars to volume and distance:** The number of stars (`N`) in a given volume (`V`) is `N = ρ * V`. If we consider a sphere of radius `d` centered on the observer, the total number of stars within this distance is:\n    `N(d) = ρ * (4/3) * π * d^3`\n\n3.  **Find the number of stars in a thin shell:** We are interested in how the number of stars changes with a property (parallax), so we should look at a differential quantity. Let's find the number of stars (`dN`) in a thin spherical shell at a distance `d` with a small thickness `dd`.\n    The volume of this shell (`dV`) is the surface area of the sphere times its thickness: `dV = 4 * π * d^2 * dd`.\n    Therefore, the number of stars in this shell is:\n    `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4 * π * d^2 * dd`\n\n4.  **Introduce Parallax:** The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax (`plx`), not distance. Parallax is defined as the inverse of the distance (when `d` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds):\n    `plx = 1 / d`  or `d = 1 / plx`\n\n5.  **Connect the differentials:** We need to relate the differential of distance (`dd`) to the differential of parallax (`d(plx)`). We can do this by taking the derivative of `d` with respect to `plx`:\n    `dd / d(plx) = d/d(plx) [1 / plx] = -1 / plx^2`\n    The negative sign simply means that as distance increases, parallax decreases. For number counts, we are interested in the magnitude of the relationship:\n    `|dd| = (1 / plx^2) * |d(plx)|`\n\n6.  **Substitute to find the final relationship:** Now we can substitute our expressions for `d` and `dd` back into the equation for `dN`:\n    `dN = ρ * 4 * π * d^2 * dd`\n    Substitute `d = 1/plx`:\n    `dN = ρ * 4 * π * (1/plx)^2 * dd`\n    Substitute `dd = (1/plx^2) * d(plx)` (using the magnitude):\n    `dN = ρ * 4 * π * (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) * d(plx)`\n    `dN = (4 * π * ρ / plx^4) * d(plx)`\n\n7.  **Find the number of stars per unit parallax:** The question asks for \"the number of stars per unit range of parallax,\" which is the quantity `dN / d(plx)`.

Let's consider a thin spherical shell at a distance `d` with a small thickness `dd`.\n    The number of stars in this shell, `dN`, can be found by differentiating `N(d)` with respect to `d`.\n    `dN = (dN(d)/dd) * dd`\n    `dN = d/dd [ρ * (4/3)πd³] * dd`\n    `dN = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n    This tells us that the number of stars in a shell of thickness `dd` at distance `d` is proportional to `d²`.\n\n4.  **Relate Distance (d) to Parallax (plx):**\n    Stellar parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance (d) to the star. The relationship is:\n    `plx = 1/d`\n    (Assuming `d` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds).\n    This can be rearranged to express distance in terms of parallax:\n    `d = 1/plx`\n\n5.  **Relate the Distance Interval (dd) to the Parallax Interval (d(plx)):**\n    To find how the number of stars varies with parallax, we need to transform the interval `dd` into an interval of parallax, `d(plx)`. We can do this by differentiating the expression for `d` with respect to `plx`:\n    `dd/d(plx) = d/d(plx) [1/plx] = -1/plx²`\n    So, `dd = (-1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n    The negative sign simply indicates that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. Since we are concerned with the number of stars in an interval, we are interested in the magnitude of the relationship:\n    `|dd| = (1/plx²) * |d(plx)|`\n\n6.  **Combine the Expressions:**\n    Now we substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` in terms of `plx` into our equation for `dN`:\n    `dN = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n    Substitute `d = 1/plx` and `dd = (1/plx²) * d(plx)`:\n    `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n    `dN = (ρ * 4π / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n7.  **Find the Number of Stars per Unit Range of Parallax:**\n    The quantity we are looking for is the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is `dN/d(plx)`. From the equation above, we can see:\n    `dN/d(plx) = ρ * 4π / plx⁴`\n\n8.  **Conclusion:**\n    Since ρ, 4, and π are constants, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis result means that there are far more stars at small parallax values (large distances) per unit parallax interval than there are at large parallax values (small distances).\n\nFinal Answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understanding the relationship between distance and parallax:**\n    Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) to a star. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n    `plx = 1/d` or `d = 1/plx`\n    Here, distance `d` is typically measured in parsecs and parallax `plx` in arcseconds.\n\n2.  **Understanding the assumption of uniform distribution:**\n    The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ` (the number of stars per unit volume), is constant everywhere in space.\n\n3.  **Considering the number of stars in a spherical shell:**\n    Let's find the number of stars, `dN`, that have a distance between `d` and `d + dd`. These stars are located in a thin spherical shell of radius `d` and thickness `dd`.\n    The volume of this shell, `dV`, is its surface area multiplied by its thickness:\n    `dV = (Area of sphere) × (thickness) = (4πd²) × dd`\n    The number of stars `dN` in this volume is the density `ρ` multiplied by the volume `dV`:\n    `dN = ρ × dV = ρ × 4πd² × dd`\n\n4.  **Expressing the number of stars in terms of parallax:**\n    Our goal is to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (`dN/d(plx)`) depends on `plx`. To do this, we need to substitute `d` and `dd` with expressions involving `plx` and `d(plx)`.\n    *   We already have `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   To find the relationship between the infinitesimals `dd` and `d(plx)`, we differentiate `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d(1/plx)/d(plx) = -1/plx²`\n        This gives us `dd = - (1/plx²) d(plx)`.\n    *   The negative sign simply indicates that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. Since we are counting stars in a shell, we are interested in the magnitude of the thickness, so we take the absolute value: `|dd| = (1/plx²) d(plx)`.\n\n5.  **Substituting back into the equation for dN:**\n    Now we replace `d` and `dd` in the equation `dN = 4πρd² dd`:\n    `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) d(plx)`\n    `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx⁴) d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Finding the number of stars per unit parallax:**\n    The question asks for \"the number of stars per unit range of parallax\", which is the quantity `dN/d(plx)`.

This means the number density of stars, which we'll call `ρ` (rho), is constant everywhere in three-dimensional space. `ρ` has units of (number of stars) / (volume), e.g., stars/parsec³.\n\n2.  **Relate Number of Stars to Volume and Distance:**\n    *   Let's consider the number of stars, `N`, within a sphere of radius `d` centered on Earth.\n    *   The volume of this sphere is `V = (4/3)πd³`.\n    *   Since the density `ρ` is constant, the total number of stars `N` inside this sphere is the density multiplied by the volume:\n        `N = ρ * V = ρ * (4/3)πd³`\n    *   From this, we can see that the total number of stars up to a distance `d` is directly proportional to the cube of the distance: `N ∝ d³`.\n\n3.  **Introduce Parallax:**\n    *   Astronomical parallax (`plx`) is defined as the inverse of the distance (`d`) to a star. The standard formula is `d = 1/plx`, where `d` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds.\n    *   We can rearrange this to `d ∝ 1/plx`.\n\n4.  **Express the Number of Stars as a Function of Parallax:**\n    *   Now, we substitute the relationship between distance and parallax into our equation for the number of stars.\n    *   The number of stars `N` within a distance `d` corresponds to the number of stars that have a parallax *greater than or equal to* `plx`. Why greater? Because a smaller distance means a larger parallax.\n    *   Let `N(>plx)` be the number of stars with parallax greater than or equal to `plx`.\n    *   `N(>plx) ∝ d³ ∝ (1/plx)³ = plx⁻³`.\n\n5.  **Determine the Number of Stars per Unit Range of Parallax:**\n    *   The question asks for \"how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx\".

For simplicity, we can set `k=1`, so `d = 1/plx`.\n\n2.  **Understand the assumption of uniform distribution.**\n    The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ`, is constant everywhere. The number of stars in any given volume `V` is `N = ρ * V`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the number of stars in a thin shell of space.**\n    We want to find the number of stars *per unit range of parallax*. This means we need to find how many stars have a parallax in a specific small range, say between `plx` and `plx + d(plx)`. This parallax range corresponds to a distance range between `d` and `d + dd`.\n\n    Let's consider a thin spherical shell of radius `d` and thickness `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this shell (`dV`) is its surface area multiplied by its thickness: `dV = 4πd² * dd`.\n    *   The number of stars (`dN`) in this shell is the volume of the shell multiplied by the constant star density `ρ`:\n        `dN = ρ * dV = 4πρd² * dd`.\n\n4.  **Express the number of stars in terms of parallax.**\n    Our goal is to find the relationship for `dN/d(plx)`.

This means the number of stars per unit volume is constant throughout space. Let's call this constant number density ρ.\n    *   **Parallax (plx):** Parallax is an angle that is inversely proportional to the distance (d) of a star. The relationship is given by `plx = 1/d` (when `d` is measured in parsecs and `plx` in arcseconds). Consequently, the distance to a star can be expressed as `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   **Target Quantity:** We need to find how the \"number of stars per unit range of parallax\" changes with `plx`. This quantity is a density function, which can be written mathematically as `dN/d(plx)`, where `N` is the number of stars.\n\n2.  **Start with the Number of Stars in a Volume:**\n    *   Let's consider the number of stars (`dN`) located in a thin spherical shell of space.

A convenient way to do this is to consider a thin spherical shell of space around the observer (us).\n    *   Let the shell be at a distance `d` from us.\n    *   Let the thickness of this shell be an infinitesimally small amount `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this spherical shell (`dV`) is its surface area multiplied by its thickness: `dV = 4πd² * dd`.\n    *   Since the star density `ρ` is constant, the number of stars (`dN`) within this shell is the density multiplied by the volume:\n        `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n\n3.  **Introduce Parallax:** The question asks for the relationship in terms of parallax (`plx`), not distance (`d`). Parallax is defined as the inverse of the distance (when `d` is measured in parsecs and `plx` in arcseconds).\n    *   `plx = 1/d`\n    *   This implies `d = 1/plx`.\n\n4.  **Connect the Differentials:** We have an expression for `dN` that involves `dd`, but we need it in terms of `d(plx)`. We can find the relationship between `dd` and `d(plx)` by differentiating the equation `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   Using calculus, we differentiate `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd / d(plx) = d/d(plx) [1/plx] = -1/plx²`\n    *   Rearranging this gives us a substitution for `dd`:\n        `dd = - (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n    *   The negative sign indicates that as distance (`d`) increases, parallax (`plx`) decreases, which is correct. When considering the number of stars in a given positive range of parallax, we are interested in the magnitude.\n\n5.  **Substitute and Combine:** Now we substitute our expressions for `d` and `dd` back into the equation for `dN`.\n    *   Original equation: `dN = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n    *   Substitute `d = 1/plx`: `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * dd`\n    *   Substitute `dd = - (1/plx²) * d(plx)`: `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * [- (1/plx²) * d(plx)]`\n    *   Simplify the expression: `dN = -4πρ * (1/plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Find the Number of Stars per Unit Parallax:** The question asks for \"how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with plx\". This is precisely the term `dN / d(plx)`.\n    *   `dN / d(plx) = -4πρ / plx⁴`\n\n7.  **Final Interpretation:** The term `dN/d(plx)` represents the density of stars as a function of parallax. Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, we can see the proportionality:\n    *   `dN / d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax varies as the inverse fourth power of the parallax.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the relationship between distance and parallax.**\n    Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) to a star. We can write this relationship as:\n    `d = 1 / plx`\n    (We can ignore the constants for this proportionality analysis).\n\n2.  **Model the distribution of stars.**\n    The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ` (rho), is constant everywhere. The number of stars per unit volume is constant.\n\n3.  **Consider a volume of space.**\n    Let's consider the number of stars, `N`, within a sphere of radius `d` centered on the observer (Earth). The volume `V` of this sphere is:\n    `V = (4/3)πd³`\n    Since the density `ρ` is constant, the number of stars `N` within this volume is:\n    `N = ρ * V = ρ * (4/3)πd³`\n\n4.  **Consider a thin shell of space.**\n    We are interested in the number of stars *per unit range* of some quantity. Let's find the number of stars `dN` in a thin spherical shell at distance `d` with a thickness `dd`.\n    The volume of this shell `dV` is the derivative of the sphere's volume `V` with respect to its radius `d`:\n    `dV = dV/dd * dd = d/dd[(4/3)πd³] * dd = 4πd² dd`\n    The number of stars `dN` in this shell is:\n    `dN = ρ * dV = 4πρd² dd`\n\n5.  **Express the number of stars in terms of parallax.**\n    Now we need to convert this expression from being in terms of `d` and `dd` to being in terms of `plx` and `d(plx)`.\n    We have `d = 1/plx`.\n    We also need to relate `dd` to `d(plx)`. We can find this by differentiating `d` with respect to `plx`:\n    `dd/d(plx) = d/d(plx) [1/plx] = -1/plx²`\n    So, `dd = -d(plx)/plx²`.\n    The negative sign just indicates that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. For counting the number of stars in a given range, we are interested in the magnitude, so we can write `dd = |d(plx)|/plx²`.\n\n6.  **Substitute `d` and `dd` into the equation for `dN`.**\n    `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx)² * (|d(plx)|/plx²) `\n    `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx⁴) * |d(plx)|`\n\n7.  **Find the number of stars per unit range of parallax.**\n    The question asks for \"the number of stars per unit range of parallax\", which is the quantity `dN / |d(plx)|`.\n    From the equation in step 6, we can rearrange to find this:\n    `dN / |d(plx)| = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\n8.  **Conclusion.**\n    Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, the number of stars per unit parallax range is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n\n`Number of stars per unit parallax range ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Define the Assumptions and Goal:**\n    *   **Assumption:** Stars are uniformly distributed in space.

The volume of this sphere is `V = (4/3)πd³`.\n    *   Since the star density `ρ` is constant, the total number of stars `N` inside this sphere is the density multiplied by the volume:\n        `N(d) = ρ * V = (4/3)πρd³`\n\n3.  **Consider a Thin Shell of Stars:**\n    *   We are interested in the number of stars at a specific distance, not the cumulative number up to that distance. Let's consider a thin spherical shell at a distance `d` with a small thickness `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this thin shell `dV` can be found by differentiating the volume `V` with respect to the radius `d`:\n        `dV = d/dd((4/3)πd³) * dd = 4πd² * dd`\n    *   The number of stars `dN` within this thin shell is the density `ρ` times the volume of the shell `dV`:\n        `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n        This tells us that the number of stars in a thin shell of constant thickness `dd` increases with the square of the distance (`d²`).\n\n4.  **Relate Distance to Parallax:**\n    *   The question is about parallax (`plx`), not distance (`d`). The parallax of a star is inversely proportional to its distance. For simplicity in astronomical units, the relation is:\n        `plx = 1/d`  or  `d = 1/plx`\n    *   We need to express the number of stars `dN` in terms of parallax. This means we must substitute `d` and `dd` with their equivalents in terms of `plx` and `d(plx)`.\n\n5.  **Express the differential `dd` in terms of `d(plx)`:**\n    *   We can find the relationship between the small thickness `dd` and the corresponding small range of parallax `d(plx)` by differentiating the equation `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d/d(plx) (1/plx) = -1/plx²`\n    *   So, `dd = (-1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n    *   The negative sign simply indicates that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. When we are counting stars in a shell, we are only concerned with the magnitude (the size of the interval), so we can write:\n        `|dd| = (1/plx²) * |d(plx)|`\n\n6.  **Substitute `d` and `dd` into the Equation for `dN`:**\n    *   We start with our equation for the number of stars in a shell:\n        `dN = 4πρ * d² * dd`\n    *   Now, substitute `d = 1/plx` and `dd = (1/plx²) * d(plx)` (ignoring the sign as it's a count of objects):\n        `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n    *   Simplify the expression:\n        `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n7.  **Find the Number of Stars per Unit Parallax:**\n    *   The question asks for \"the number of stars per unit range of parallax\", which is the expression `dN/d(plx)`.\n    *   From our last equation, we can find this by dividing by `d(plx)`:\n        `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n    *   Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are constants, the relationship is:\n        `dN/d(plx) ~ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis shows that the number of stars found in a given small interval of parallax decreases very rapidly as the parallax itself gets smaller (i.e., as we look at stars farther and farther away).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the relationship between distance and parallax.**\n    The parallax of a star, `plx`, is inversely proportional to its distance, `d`, from the observer. The relationship is given by:\n    `d = 1 / plx`\n    For simplicity, we assume `d` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds.\n\n2.  **State the assumption.**\n    The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. This means the number of stars per unit volume, which is the number density `ρ`, is constant throughout space.\n    `ρ = constant`\n\n3.  **Calculate the number of stars in a thin spherical shell.**\n    Consider a thin spherical shell of space centered on the observer (Sun).\n    *   Let the inner radius of the shell be `d`.\n    *   Let the thickness of the shell be `dd`.\n    The volume of this thin shell, `dV`, can be approximated by its surface area multiplied by its thickness:\n    `dV = 4πd² dd`\n\n    The number of stars, `dN`, within this shell is the number density `ρ` multiplied by the volume `dV`:\n    `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² dd`\n    Since `ρ` and `4π` are constants, we can write the proportionality:\n    `dN ∝ d² dd`\n\n4.  **Express the relationship in terms of parallax.**\n    We want to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (`dN/d(plx)`) depends on `plx`. To do this, we need to substitute `d` and `dd` with expressions involving `plx`.\n    *   From step 1, we have `d = 1 / plx`.\n    *   To find the relationship between the differentials `dd` and `d(plx)`, we differentiate the distance equation with respect to parallax:\n        `dd / d(plx) = d(1/plx) / d(plx) = -1 / plx²`\n    *   This gives us `dd = - (1/plx²) d(plx)`. The negative sign just indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases. When we are counting the number of stars in a range, we are concerned with the magnitude, so we can ignore the negative sign:\n        `|dd| = (1 / plx²) d(plx)`\n\n5.  **Combine the expressions.**\n    Now, substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` into the proportionality for `dN` from step 3:\n    `dN ∝ (1 / plx)² * ( (1 / plx²) d(plx) )`\n    `dN ∝ (1 / plx²) * (1 / plx²) d(plx)`\n    `dN ∝ (1 / plx⁴) d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Find the number of stars per unit range of parallax.**\n    The quantity we are looking for is the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is `dN / d(plx)`. From the final proportionality in the previous step, we can see:\n    `dN / d(plx) ∝ 1 / plx⁴`\n\n7.  **Conclusion.**\n    The number of stars per unit range of parallax varies as the inverse fourth power of the parallax.

This means the number of stars per unit volume is constant throughout space. Let's call this constant density `ρ`.\n    2.  **Parallax (plx):** Parallax is an angle that is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) of a star. The relationship is `d = 1/plx`. For simplicity, we can ignore the constants that depend on the units used (like parsecs and arcseconds) as we are interested in the proportionality.\n    3.  **The Goal:** We need to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. This can be written as `dN/d(plx)`, where `N` is the number of stars.\n\n*   **Step-by-Step Derivation**\n    1.  **Number of stars in a volume:** Let's consider a thin spherical shell of space at a distance `d` from Earth with a small thickness `dd`.\n    2.  The volume of this shell (`dV`) is approximately its surface area multiplied by its thickness:\n        `dV = (Area of sphere) * (thickness) = 4 * π * d² * dd`\n    3.  The number of stars (`dN`) in this thin shell is the density (`ρ`) multiplied by the volume of the shell (`dV`):\n        `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4 * π * d² * dd`\n    4.  **Express in terms of parallax:** Now we need to switch from the variable `d` to `plx`. We use the relationship `d = 1/plx`.\n    5.  We also need to find the relationship between the small thickness `dd` and a small range of parallax `d(plx)`. We can do this by taking the derivative of `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `d(d)/d(plx) = d/d(plx) (1/plx) = -1/plx²`\n        This gives us `dd = (-1/plx²) * d(plx)`. The negative sign just means that as distance (`d`) increases, parallax (`plx`) decreases. Since we are interested in the number of stars in a given range (a magnitude), we can ignore the negative sign.\n        `dd = (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n    6.  **Substitute back into the equation for dN:** Now we substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` in terms of `plx` back into our equation for `dN`:\n        `dN = ρ * 4 * π * d² * dd`\n        `dN = ρ * 4 * π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n        `dN = ρ * 4 * π * (1/plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n    7.  **Find the number per unit parallax:** The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is `dN/d(plx)`. We can find this by dividing our equation by `d(plx)`:\n        `dN / d(plx) = ρ * 4 * π * (1/plx⁴)`\n    8.  **Conclusion:** Since `ρ`, `4`, and `π` are all constants, we can see the relationship:\n        `dN / d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThe number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 49:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Fundamental Assumptions:**\n    *   **Uniform Star Distribution:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. In a three-dimensional context, this means the number density of stars, denoted by ρ (the number of stars per unit volume), is constant everywhere in space.\n    *   **Parallax and Distance:** Stellar parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) to the star. The standard definition is `plx = 1/d` where `d` is measured in parsecs and `plx` in arcseconds. For our derivation, the constant of proportionality doesn't matter, so we can use `d = 1/plx`.\n\n2.  **Counting Stars in a Volume of Space:**\n    *   Let's consider the number of stars at a distance between `d` and `d + dd` from us. These stars occupy a thin spherical shell.\n    *   The volume of a sphere of radius `d` is `V = (4/3)πd³`.\n    *   The volume of the thin spherical shell (`dV`) with radius `d` and thickness `dd` is the surface area of the sphere multiplied by its thickness: `dV = 4πd² * dd`.\n    *   Since the star density (ρ) is constant, the number of stars (`dN`) in this shell is the density multiplied by the volume of the shell:\n        `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n\n3.  **Transforming from Distance to Parallax:**\n    *   The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax (`dN/d(plx)`), not per unit range of distance. So, we need to express our equation for `dN` in terms of `plx`.\n    *   We have two substitutions to make: one for `d` and one for `dd`.\n    *   From `d = 1/plx`, we can substitute for `d`.\n    *   To substitute for `dd`, we need to find the relationship between the differential elements `dd` and `d(plx)`. We can do this by differentiating `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d/d(plx) (1/plx) = -1/plx²`\n    *   This gives us `dd = - (1/plx²) * d(plx)`. When counting the number of stars, we are interested in the magnitude of the interval, so we can ignore the negative sign (it just signifies that as distance increases, parallax decreases).\n        `|dd| = (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n\n4.  **Deriving the Final Relation:**\n    *   Now we substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` into our equation for `dN`:\n        `dN = ρ * 4π * d² * dd`\n        `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * ( (1/plx²) * d(plx) )`\n    *   Combine the terms involving `plx`:\n        `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n    *   To find the number of stars per unit range of parallax, we divide by `d(plx)`:\n        `dN/d(plx) = (4πρ) / plx⁴`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are constants, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (`dN/d(plx)`) is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n    *   `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~ 1/plx³\nB) ~ 1/plx⁴\nC) ~ 1/plx²\nD) ~ 1/plx¹\n\nOur derived relationship matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Define the initial assumption:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ`, is constant everywhere. `ρ` = (Number of stars) / (Unit Volume).\n\n2.  **Consider the number of stars in a spherical shell:** Let's find the number of stars, `dN`, located in a thin spherical shell of space. This shell is between a distance `d` from the observer and a slightly larger distance `d + dd`.\n    *   The volume of this thin shell, `dV`, can be approximated by its surface area multiplied by its thickness.\n    *   Surface area of a sphere of radius `d` is `A = 4πd^2`.\n    *   Thickness of the shell is `dd`.\n    *   So, the volume of the shell is `dV = 4πd^2 dd`.\n    *   Since the star density `ρ` is constant, the number of stars `dN` in this shell is `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd^2 dd`.\n\n3.  **Relate distance (d) to parallax (plx):** Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. The standard formula is `plx = 1/d` (when `plx` is in arcseconds and `d` is in parsecs). From this, we can express the distance `d` in terms of parallax: `d = 1/plx`.\n\n4.  **Relate the differential elements (dd and d(plx)):** The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of *parallax*, which is `dN/d(plx)`. Our current expression for `dN` involves `dd`. We need to convert `dd` into terms of `d(plx)`. We can do this by differentiating the relationship `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`:\n    *   `dd / d(plx) = d/d(plx) [1/plx] = -1/plx^2`.\n    *   Therefore, `dd = - (1/plx^2) d(plx)`.\n    *   The negative sign indicates that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. When we are considering the number of stars in an interval, we are interested in the magnitude, so we can ignore the negative sign for this part of the derivation. Thus, we use `dd = (1/plx^2) d(plx)`.\n\n5.  **Substitute to get the distribution in terms of parallax:** Now we substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` back into our equation for `dN`:\n    *   Original equation: `dN = ρ * 4πd^2 dd`\n    *   Substitute `d = 1/plx`: `dN = ρ * 4π(1/plx)^2 dd`\n    *   Substitute `dd = (1/plx^2) d(plx)`: `dN = ρ * 4π(1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) d(plx)`\n    *   Simplify the expression: `dN = (4πρ / plx^4) d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Find the number of stars per unit range of parallax:** The question asks for how the \"number of stars per unit range of parallax\" changes with `plx`. This is exactly the term `dN/d(plx)`.\n    *   From our last equation, we can see that: `dN / d(plx) = 4πρ / plx^4`.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The term `4πρ` is a constant because we assumed a uniform star density `ρ`. Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx^4`.\n\nThis means that there are vastly more stars with very small parallaxes (which are very far away) per parallax interval than there are stars with large parallaxes (which are very close).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\nHere is the reasoning and thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the relationship between the number of stars per unit parallax range (`dN/d(plx)`) and the parallax (`plx`) itself.\n\n2.  **State the Core Assumption:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `n` (number of stars per unit volume), is constant everywhere.\n\n3.  **Relate Number of Stars to Volume:** If the star density `n` is constant, then the number of stars `N` in any given volume `V` is simply `N = n * V`.\n\n4.  **Consider a Relevant Volume:** We are interested in how the number of stars changes with parallax. Since parallax is related to distance, it's natural to consider the number of stars within a thin shell of space at a certain distance. Let's consider a thin spherical shell with radius `d` and thickness `dd` centered on the observer (Earth).\n\n5.  **Calculate the Volume of the Shell:** The volume `dV` of this thin spherical shell is its surface area multiplied by its thickness.\n    *   Surface area of a sphere of radius `d` is `A = 4πd²`.\n    *   Volume of the shell is `dV = A * dd = 4πd² dd`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Number of Stars in the Shell:** The number of stars `dN` in this thin shell is the star density `n` times the shell's volume `dV`.\n    *   `dN = n * dV = n * (4πd² dd)`\n\n7.  **Introduce Parallax:** The key is to switch from the variable of distance (`d`) to the variable of parallax (`plx`).\n    *   The relationship between parallax `plx` (in arcseconds) and distance `d` (in parsecs) is `plx = 1/d`.\n    *   This also means `d = 1/plx`.\n\n8.  **Convert the Differentials:** We have `dN` in terms of `dd`, but we need it in terms of `d(plx)` to find the quantity `dN/d(plx)`. We can find the relationship between `dd` and `d(plx)` by differentiating the equation `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`.\n    *   `d/d(plx) [d] = d/d(plx) [1/plx]`\n    *   `dd/d(plx) = -1/plx²`\n    *   Therefore, `dd = -(1/plx²) d(plx)`.\n\n9.  **Interpret the Negative Sign:** The negative sign simply means that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. Since we are calculating a *number* of stars in a given (positive) range of parallax, we are interested in the magnitude. So, we can take the absolute value: `|dd| = (1/plx²) d(plx)`.\n\n10. **Substitute and Simplify:** Now, substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` back into the equation for `dN`:\n    *   `dN = n * 4πd² dd`\n    *   Substitute `d = 1/plx`: `dN = n * 4π(1/plx)² dd`\n    *   Substitute `|dd| = (1/plx²) d(plx)`: `dN = n * 4π(1/plx²) * (1/plx²) d(plx)`\n    *   Combine the terms: `dN = (4πn) * (1/plx⁴) d(plx)`\n\n11. **Find the Final Relationship:** The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is the expression `dN/d(plx)`. We can find this by rearranging the final equation from the previous step.\n    *   `dN/d(plx) = (4πn) / plx⁴`\n\n12. **Conclusion:** The term `4πn` is a constant (since `n` is constant).

We can find this by differentiating `N(d)` with respect to `d`.\n    *   `dN/dd = d/dd [ρ * (4/3) * π * d^3]`\n    *   `dN/dd = ρ * (4/3) * π * (3 * d^2) = 4 * π * ρ * d^2`\n    *   This tells us that the number of stars in a thin shell at distance `d` is proportional to `d^2`. `dN/dd ∝ d^2`.\n\n5.  **Introduce Parallax:** Stellar parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) to the star. The standard formula is:\n    *   `plx = 1/d` (where `d` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds).\n    *   This means we can also write distance in terms of parallax: `d = 1/plx`.\n\n6.  **Change the Variable from Distance to Parallax:** We want to find `dN/d(plx)`, the number of stars per unit range of parallax. We have `dN/dd`. We can use the chain rule from calculus to change the variable of differentiation:\n    *   `dN/d(plx) = (dN/dd) * (dd/d(plx))`\n\n7.  **Calculate the components:**\n    *   From step 4, we have `dN/dd ∝ d^2`. We can substitute `d = 1/plx` into this expression:\n        `dN/dd ∝ (1/plx)^2 = 1/plx^2`\n    *   Now we need to find the derivative `dd/d(plx)`:\n        `d = 1/plx = plx^(-1)`\n        `dd/d(plx) = -1 * plx^(-2) = -1/plx^2`\n    *   When we talk about the number of stars in a range, we are concerned with the magnitude, so we can ignore the negative sign (it just indicates that `d` decreases as `plx` increases). So we take the absolute value: `|dd/d(plx)| = 1/plx^2`.\n\n8.  **Combine the results:** Now we substitute these components back into the chain rule equation from step 6.\n    *   `dN/d(plx) ∝ (dN/dd) * |dd/d(plx)|`\n    *   `dN/d(plx) ∝ (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2)`\n    *   `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^4`\n\n**Conclusion:**\nFor a uniform distribution of stars, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx^4`.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the key quantities:**\n    *   **Parallax (plx):** Parallax is an angle that is inversely proportional to the distance (d) of a star. The relationship is `plx = 1/d` (assuming parallax is measured in arcseconds and distance in parsecs). From this, we can write the distance as `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   **Uniform distribution:** This is a crucial assumption.

Mathematically, this can be represented as `dN/d(plx)`, where `N` is the number of stars. We want to find how this quantity changes as `plx` changes.\n\n2.  **Formulate the problem:** We need to find the number of stars (`dN`) that lie within a small parallax interval from `plx` to `plx + d(plx)`.\n\n3.  **Translate from parallax to distance:** A parallax interval `[plx, plx + d(plx)]` corresponds to a specific region in space.\n    *   A star with parallax `plx` is at a distance `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   A star with parallax `plx + d(plx)` is at a distance `d' = 1 / (plx + d(plx))`.\n    *   Since `d(plx)` is a small increment, this range of parallaxes corresponds to stars located in a thin spherical shell around the observer.\n\n4.  **Calculate the volume of the spherical shell:**\n    *   The radius of the inner surface of the shell is `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   The thickness of the shell, `dd`, can be found by differentiating `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd = d(1/plx) = (-1/plx^2) d(plx)`\n    *   We are interested in the magnitude of the thickness, so `|dd| = (1/plx^2) d(plx)`.\n    *   The volume of a thin spherical shell (`dV`) is approximately its surface area multiplied by its thickness.\n    *   Surface area of the sphere = `4 * π * d^2`.\n    *   Volume `dV = (Surface Area) * (thickness) = (4 * π * d^2) * |dd|`.\n\n5.  **Substitute the parallax relationships into the volume formula:**\n    *   Replace `d` with `1/plx`.\n    *   Replace `|dd|` with `(1/plx^2) d(plx)`.\n    *   `dV = (4 * π * (1/plx)^2) * (1/plx^2 * d(plx))`\n    *   `dV = (4 * π / plx^2) * (1 / plx^2) * d(plx)`\n    *   `dV = (4 * π / plx^4) * d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the number of stars in this volume:**\n    *   The number of stars (`dN`) in the volume `dV` is the number density (ρ) multiplied by the volume.\n    *   `dN = ρ * dV`\n    *   `dN = ρ * (4 * π / plx^4) * d(plx)`\n\n7.  **Find the number of stars per unit range of parallax:**\n    *   To find the quantity the question asks for (`dN/d(plx)`), we simply divide the expression for `dN` by `d(plx)`.\n    *   `dN / d(plx) = ρ * 4 * π / plx^4`\n    *   Since ρ (number density) and 4π are constants, we can see the proportionality:\n    *   `dN / d(plx) ∝ 1 / plx^4`\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax (`plx`) as `1/plx^4`. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Basic Concepts**\n    *   **Uniform Distribution of Stars:** This assumption means that the number density of stars, denoted by ρ (rho), is constant throughout space. That is, the number of stars in any given volume is proportional to that volume.\n    *   **Parallax (plx):** Stellar parallax is an apparent shift of a nearby star's position against the background of more distant stars as the Earth orbits the Sun. Parallax is inversely proportional to the distance (d) to the star. The relationship is `plx = k/d`, where `k` is a constant. For simplicity in astrophysics (using parsecs for distance and arcseconds for parallax), this relationship is simply `plx = 1/d`. Therefore, `d = 1/plx`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Number of Stars within a certain Distance**\n    *   Let's find the total number of stars, `N(d)`, within a sphere of radius `d` centered on the observer (Earth).\n    *   The volume of this sphere is `V = (4/3)πd³`.\n    *   Since the star density `ρ` is constant, the total number of stars `N(d)` is the density multiplied by the volume:\n        `N(d) = ρ * V = ρ * (4/3)πd³`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Number of Stars in a Thin Shell**\n    *   We are interested in the number of stars *per unit range of parallax*. This means we need to consider how the number of stars changes as parallax changes. It's easier to first find how the number of stars changes with distance and then convert to parallax.\n    *   Let's find the number of stars, `dN`, in a thin spherical shell between distance `d` and `d + dd`.\n    *   The volume of this shell, `dV`, can be found by differentiating the volume of the sphere with respect to its radius `d`:\n        `dV/dd = d/dd [ (4/3)πd³ ] = 4πd²`\n        So, `dV = 4πd² dd`\n    *   The number of stars in this shell is the density times the shell's volume:\n        `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² dd`\n    *   This equation gives us the number of stars found at a distance `d` within a small distance range `dd`.\n\n4.  **Relate the Differential in Distance (`dd`) to the Differential in Parallax (`d(plx)`)**\n    *   We have the relationship `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   We need to find how `dd` relates to `d(plx)`. We can do this by taking the derivative of `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd / d(plx) = d/d(plx) [1/plx] = -1/plx²`\n    *   Rearranging this gives: `dd = -d(plx) / plx²`.\n    *   The negative sign simply indicates that as distance (`d`) increases, parallax (`plx`) decreases. Since we are interested in the *number* of stars, we can consider the magnitude: `|dd| = d(plx) / plx²`.\n\n5.  **Substitute Distance and `dd` with Parallax and `d(plx)`**\n    *   Now we take our expression for `dN` and replace all the terms involving distance (`d` and `dd`) with terms involving parallax (`plx` and `d(plx)`).\n    *   Original expression: `dN = 4πρd² dd`\n    *   Substitute `d = 1/plx`:\n        `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx)² * dd`\n    *   Substitute `dd = d(plx) / plx²` (ignoring the negative sign as we care about the magnitude):\n        `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx²) * (d(plx) / plx²) `\n    *   Simplify the expression:\n        `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Find the Number of Stars per Unit Range of Parallax**\n    *   The question asks for \"how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx\". This quantity is mathematically represented as `dN/d(plx)`.\n    *   From our last equation, we can simply divide by `d(plx)`:\n        `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\n7.  **Conclusion**\n    *   In this final expression, `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants.\n    *   Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n    *   `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the assumptions:**\n    *   The stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number density of stars, ρ (number of stars per unit volume), is a constant.\n    *   We are interested in the number of stars, N, as a function of their parallax, plx.\n\n2.  **Relate Number of Stars to Distance:**\n    *   Let's consider the number of stars up to a certain distance `d` from the observer. The volume of a sphere with radius `d` is `V = (4/3) * π * d³`.\n    *   Since the star density `ρ` is constant, the total number of stars `N` within this volume is `N = ρ * V = ρ * (4/3) * π * d³`.\n\n3.  **Relate Distance to Parallax:**\n    *   Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance (d) to a star. The fundamental relationship is `d = 1/plx` (when `d` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds).\n    *   Substitute this into the equation for `N`:\n        `N(plx) = ρ * (4/3) * π * (1/plx)³ = (4 * π * ρ) / (3 * plx³)`.\n\n4.  **Find the Number of Stars per Unit Range of Parallax:**\n    *   The question asks for how the *number of stars per unit range of parallax* changes. This quantity is the derivative of the number of stars `N` with respect to the parallax `plx`, which is `dN/d(plx)`.\n    *   We need to differentiate the expression `N(plx)` with respect to `plx`.\n        Let `C = (4 * π * ρ) / 3`, which is a constant. Then `N(plx) = C * plx⁻³`.\n    *   Taking the derivative:\n        `dN/d(plx) = d/d(plx) [C * plx⁻³]`\n        `dN/d(plx) = C * (-3 * plx⁻⁴) = -3 * C / plx⁴`\n\n5.  **Interpret the Result:**\n    *   The negative sign indicates that as parallax `plx` increases (meaning the stars are closer), the total cumulative number of stars `N` decreases, which makes sense from our formulation. However, the question is about the *number of stars in a given parallax range*, which is a positive quantity.

Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n    `plx ∝ 1/d` or `d ∝ 1/plx`\n    For simplicity in calculations, we can write `d = 1/plx` by choosing appropriate units (e.g., distance in parsecs and parallax in arcseconds).\n\n2.  **Model the distribution of stars.**\n    The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ`, is constant everywhere. `ρ` represents the number of stars per unit volume.\n    `ρ = constant`\n\n3.  **Calculate the number of stars in a given volume.**\n    Consider a thin spherical shell of space centered on the observer (Earth). Let the inner radius of the shell be `d` and its thickness be a small amount `dd`.\n    *   The surface area of this sphere is `A = 4πd²`.\n    *   The volume of the thin shell (`dV`) is its surface area multiplied by its thickness: `dV = 4πd² * dd`.\n    *   The number of stars (`dN`) within this thin shell is the volume of the shell multiplied by the constant star density `ρ`:\n        `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n    This equation tells us that the number of stars in a small distance range `dd` at distance `d` is proportional to `d²`.\n\n4.  **Translate the relationship from distance to parallax.**\n    Our goal is to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (`dN/d(plx)`) changes with `plx`. We need to substitute `d` and `dd` in the equation for `dN` with expressions involving `plx` and `d(plx)`.\n    *   We already have `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   We need to find the relationship between `dd` and `d(plx)`. We can do this by taking the derivative of `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d(1/plx)/d(plx) = -1/plx²`\n        Therefore, `dd = -(1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n    *   The negative sign simply indicates that as distance (`d`) increases, parallax (`plx`) decreases.

From the equation above, we can see:\n    `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n    Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, we find that the number of stars per unit range of parallax is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the parallax.\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 60:\nHere is a thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Core assumption:** Stars are uniformly distributed in space.

For a uniform distribution, the number of stars (`N`) in any given volume (`V`) is `N = ρ * V`.\n    *   Next, we need to relate distance (`d`) to parallax (`plx`). Parallax is defined as the inverse of the distance: `plx = 1/d`. Therefore, `d = 1/plx`. We assume `d` is measured in parsecs and `plx` in arcseconds.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Number of Stars in a Specific Volume:**\n    *   It's easiest to think about stars at a certain distance `d`.

We can do this by differentiating the distance-parallax relation:\n        `d(d) / d(plx) = d/d(plx) [1/plx] = -1/plx²`\n    *   This gives us `dd = - (1/plx²) * d(plx)`. The negative sign indicates that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. Since we are counting stars, we are interested in the magnitude, so we can ignore the negative sign.\n        `|dd| = (1/plx²) * |d(plx)|`\n\n6.  **Substituting into the Star Count Equation:** Now substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` back into our equation for `dN`:\n    `dN = n * 4π * (1/plx)² * [ (1/plx²) * d(plx) ]`\n\n7.  **Simplifying the Expression:** Combine the terms involving `plx`:\n    `dN = n * 4π * (1/plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n    This can be rewritten as:\n    `dN / d(plx) = 4πn / plx⁴`\n\n8.  **Final Conclusion:** The term `dN / d(plx)` represents the number of stars per unit range of parallax. Since `4`, `π`, and the stellar density `n` are all constants, we can see the proportionality:\n    `Number of stars per unit parallax range ∝ 1 / plx⁴`\n\nThis means the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to the inverse fourth power of the parallax.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the relationship between distance and parallax.**\n    Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) to a star. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n    `plx = 1/d`\n    This means that the distance `d` can be expressed in terms of parallax as:\n    `d = 1/plx`\n\n2.  **Understand the assumption of uniform distribution.**\n    The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. This means that the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ` (rho), is constant throughout space. `ρ` is the number of stars per unit volume.\n    `ρ = Number of Stars / Volume = constant`\n\n3.  **Calculate the number of stars within a certain distance.**\n    Consider a sphere centered on the observer (Earth) with a radius `d`. The volume `V` of this sphere is:\n    `V = (4/3) * π * d^3`\n    The total number of stars `N` inside this sphere is the density multiplied by the volume:\n    `N = ρ * V = ρ * (4/3) * π * d^3`\n    Since `ρ`, `π`, and `4/3` are constants, the number of stars within a distance `d` is proportional to the cube of the distance:\n    `N ∝ d^3`\n\n4.  **Find the number of stars in a thin spherical shell.**\n    We want to find the number of stars `dN` in a thin spherical shell between distance `d` and `d + dd`. The volume of this shell `dV` is the surface area of the sphere (`4πd^2`) multiplied by the thickness of the shell (`dd`):\n    `dV = 4πd^2 * dd`\n    The number of stars `dN` in this shell is the density `ρ` times the volume of the shell `dV`:\n    `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd^2 * dd`\n    This gives us the number of stars in a specific distance range `[d, d + dd]`.\n\n5.  **Convert the expression to be in terms of parallax.**\n    The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is `dN/d(plx)`. We need to substitute `d` and `dd` in the equation for `dN` with expressions involving `plx`.\n    *   We already have `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   To find `dd`, we differentiate `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d/d(plx) [1/plx] = -1/plx^2`\n        So, `dd = (-1/plx^2) * d(plx)`\n    Now, substitute these into the equation for `dN`:\n    `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx^2 * d(plx))`\n    `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx^2) * (-1/plx^2 * d(plx))`\n    `dN = -4πρ * (1/plx^4) * d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Determine the number of stars per unit parallax.**\n    The number of stars per unit range of parallax is the expression `dN/d(plx)`.\n    `dN/d(plx) = -4πρ / plx^4`\n    The negative sign indicates that as parallax `plx` increases, the corresponding distance `d` decreases, so we are looking at a shell closer to us. The density, or the number of stars in a given small range of parallax, is a positive quantity. We are interested in how the magnitude of this number changes with `plx`.\n    The magnitude is:\n    `|dN/d(plx)| = 4πρ / plx^4`\n    Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are constants, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx^4`.\n    `Number of stars per unit parallax ~ 1/plx^4`\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Define the relationship between key variables:**\n    *   **Uniform distribution:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ` (number of stars per unit volume), is constant throughout space.\n    *   **Parallax (plx):** Parallax is inversely proportional to the distance `d` to a star. We can write this relationship as `plx = k/d` or, for simplicity in astronomical units, `d = 1/plx`.\n\n2.  **Count stars in a volume of space:**\n    *   Let's consider the number of stars `N` up to a certain distance `d`. These stars are contained within a sphere of radius `d`.\n    *   The volume `V` of this sphere is `V = (4/3)πd³`.\n    *   Since the star density `ρ` is constant, the total number of stars `N` within this sphere is `N = ρ * V = ρ * (4/3)πd³`.\n\n3.  **Express the number of stars as a function of parallax:**\n    *   Now, we substitute the relationship `d = 1/plx` into the equation for `N`:\n        `N(plx) = ρ * (4/3)π * (1/plx)³ = (4πρ/3) * (1/plx³)`.\n    *   This equation gives us the total number of stars with a parallax *greater than or equal to* `plx` (since smaller distance `d` corresponds to larger parallax `plx`).\n\n4.  **Find the number of stars per unit range of parallax:**\n    *   The question asks how the *number of stars per unit range of parallax* changes with `plx`. This is a differential quantity, which can be expressed as `dN/d(plx)`.\n    *   We need to differentiate the expression for `N(plx)` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dN/d(plx) = d/d(plx) [ (4πρ/3) * plx⁻³ ]`\n    *   Applying the power rule for differentiation `d(xⁿ)/dx = nxⁿ⁻¹`:\n        `dN/d(plx) = (4πρ/3) * (-3 * plx⁻⁴) = -4πρ * plx⁻⁴ = -4πρ / plx⁴`.\n\n5.  **Interpret the result:**\n    *   The negative sign indicates that as parallax `plx` increases, the cumulative number of stars `N` decreases (which is correct according to our definition of N as the number of stars *beyond* a certain parallax). However, the question is about the number of stars *in a given parallax range*, which is a positive quantity. So we are interested in the magnitude.\n    *   `|dN/d(plx)| = 4πρ / plx⁴`.\n    *   Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are constants, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n    *   Therefore, the relationship is: `dN/d(plx) ~ 1/plx⁴`.\n\n6.  **Match with the given options:**\n    *   A) ~ 1/plx¹\n    *   B) ~ 1/plx²\n    *   C) ~ 1/plx⁴\n    *   D) ~ 1/plx³\n\n    Our derived relationship matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Key Concepts:**\n    *   **Uniform Distribution of Stars:** This is the core assumption. It means that the number of stars per unit volume is constant everywhere in space. Let's call this constant number density `ρ`.\n    *   **Parallax (plx):** Parallax is an angle that is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) of a star. The relationship is given by:\n        `plx = 1/d`\n        This implies that the distance to a star can be expressed as:\n        `d = 1/plx`\n\n2.  **Formulate the Goal:**\n    The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax. In mathematical terms, if `N` is the number of stars, we need to find how the quantity `dN/d(plx)` depends on `plx`.\n\n3.  **Relate the Number of Stars to Distance:**\n    *   Let's consider a thin spherical shell of space centered on the Sun. The shell is at a distance `d` and has a small thickness `dd`.\n    *   The surface area of a sphere with radius `d` is `A = 4πd²`.\n    *   The volume of this thin shell (`dV`) is its surface area multiplied by its thickness:\n        `dV = 4πd² * dd`\n    *   Since the stars are uniformly distributed with density `ρ`, the number of stars (`dN`) within this thin shell is the volume of the shell multiplied by the star density:\n        `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n\n4.  **Translate from Distance to Parallax:**\n    Now, we need to express `dN` in terms of `plx` instead of `d`. We have two substitutions to make:\n    *   First, substitute `d = 1/plx` into the equation:\n        `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * dd`\n    *   Second, we need to relate the thickness of the shell `dd` to the corresponding interval in parallax `d(plx)`. We can do this by differentiating the relation `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd / d(plx) = d/d(plx) [1/plx] = -1/plx²`\n        This gives us `dd = - (1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n    *   The negative sign simply indicates that as distance (`d`) increases, parallax (`plx`) decreases. Since we are interested in the *number* of stars in a given range (which is always positive), we can consider the magnitude:\n        `|dd| = (1/plx²) * |d(plx)|`\n\n5.  **Combine the Expressions:**\n    Now, substitute the expression for `dd` back into the equation for `dN`:\n    `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n    `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Find the Number of Stars per Unit Parallax:**\n    The quantity we are looking for is the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is `dN/d(plx)`. We can find this by rearranging the equation from the previous step:\n    `dN / d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\n7.  **Analyze the Proportionality:**\n    Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, we can see the proportionality:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\n8.  **Conclusion:**\n    The number of stars per unit range of parallax changes as the inverse fourth power of the parallax (`1/plx⁴`).

We can do this by taking the derivative of `d` with respect to `plx`:\n    `d = 1 / plx = plx^(-1)`\n    `dd / d(plx) = -1 * plx^(-2) = -1 / plx^2`\n    So, `dd = - d(plx) / plx^2`.\n\n    The negative sign simply means that as distance (`d`) increases, parallax (`plx`) decreases. When we are considering the *number* of stars in an interval, we are interested in the magnitude of the interval.

We can find this by differentiating the parallax equation with respect to `plx`:\n    `d(d)/d(plx) = d(1/plx)/d(plx) = -1/plx²`\n    This gives us the relationship: `dd = - (1/plx²) d(plx)`.\n    Since we are counting stars, `dN` must be a positive number. A positive interval `d(plx)` corresponds to a negative interval `dd` (as distance decreases when parallax increases). We are interested in the number of stars within a parallax range, so we consider the magnitude of the change:\n    `|dd| = (1/plx²) d(plx)`\n\n7.  **Substitute `d` and `dd` into the `dN` equation:** Now we substitute the expressions for `d` and `|dd|` in terms of `plx` into our equation for the number of stars in the shell (`dN = 4πρd² |dd|`).\n    *   Replace `d` with `1/plx`.\n    *   Replace `|dd|` with `(1/plx²) d(plx)`.\n\n    `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) d(plx)`\n\n8.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx⁴) d(plx)`\n\n9.  **Find the Number of Stars per Unit Range of Parallax:** The question asks for how the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is the quantity `dN/d(plx)`, changes with `plx`.

The volume of the thin shell (dV) can be approximated by its surface area multiplied by its thickness:\n    dV = A * dd = 4πd² * dd\n\n4.  **Calculate the number of stars in the shell:** Using our assumption of uniform density ρ, the number of stars (dN) in this thin shell is:\n    dN = ρ * dV = ρ * (4πd² * dd)\n\n5.  **Relate distance (d) to parallax (plx):** Parallax is defined as the inverse of the distance. For simplicity, let's use the standard astronomical units where `plx = 1/d` (with `plx` in arcseconds and `d` in parsecs). From this relationship, we can also express `d` in terms of `plx`:\n    d = 1/plx\n\n6.  **Relate the infinitesimal changes (dd and d(plx)):** We need to find how a small change in distance (`dd`) relates to a small change in parallax (`d(plx)`). We can find this by taking the derivative of the distance equation with respect to parallax:\n    d(d)/d(plx) = d/d(plx) * (1/plx) = -1/plx²\n    Rearranging this gives us the relationship between `dd` and `d(plx)`:\n    dd = (-1/plx²) * d(plx)\n    Since we are counting stars, we are only interested in the magnitude of the change, not the direction (the negative sign just shows that as distance increases, parallax decreases). So we can write:\n    |dd| = (1/plx²) * |d(plx)|\n\n7.  **Substitute parallax into the star count equation:** Now we take our equation for the number of stars in the shell (dN) and replace the distance terms (`d` and `dd`) with their parallax equivalents.\n    Original equation: dN = ρ * 4πd² * dd\n    Substitute d = 1/plx: dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * dd\n    Substitute dd = (1/plx²) * d(plx): dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) * d(plx)\n\n8.  **Simplify the expression:** Combine the terms to get the final relationship between the number of stars `dN` in a small parallax range `d(plx)`:\n    dN = (ρ * 4π / plx⁴) * d(plx)\n\n9.  **Find the number of stars per unit range of parallax:** The question asks for \"the number of stars per unit range of parallax,\" which is mathematically represented as dN/d(plx). We can find this by dividing both sides of our equation by `d(plx)`:\n    dN / d(plx) = ρ * 4π / plx⁴\n\n10. **Determine the proportionality:** In this final expression, ρ, 4, and π are all constants.

It is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) to the star. The relationship is given by:\n    `plx = 1/d`\n    This means that distance can be expressed as:\n    `d = 1/plx`\n\n2.  **Understand the \"uniform distribution of stars\" assumption.**\n    This assumption means that the number density of stars (`ρ`), which is the number of stars per unit volume, is constant everywhere in space.\n\n3.  **Calculate the number of stars in a thin spherical shell.**\n    Let's consider the number of stars (`dN`) in a thin spherical shell of space at a distance `d` from Earth with a small thickness `dd`.\n    *   The volume of a sphere with radius `d` is `V = (4/3)πd³`.\n    *   The volume of the thin shell (`dV`) is the surface area of the sphere (`A = 4πd²`) multiplied by its thickness (`dd`).\n        `dV = 4πd² dd`\n    *   The number of stars (`dN`) in this shell is the density (`ρ`) multiplied by the volume of the shell (`dV`).\n        `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² dd`\n\n4.  **Express the number of stars in terms of parallax.**\n    Our goal is to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (`dN/dplx`) depends on `plx`. To do this, we need to substitute `d` and `dd` with expressions involving `plx`.\n    *   We already have `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   We need to find the relationship between `dd` and `dplx`. We can get this by differentiating `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/dplx = d/dplx (1/plx) = -1/plx²`\n        Therefore, `dd = -dplx / plx²`.\n    *   The negative sign indicates that as distance (`d`) increases, parallax (`plx`) decreases.

Let's consider a thin spherical shell of radius `d` and thickness `dd`. The volume of this shell (`dV`) is its surface area multiplied by its thickness:\n    `dV = (4 * π * d²) * dd`\n\n4.  **Find the number of stars in this shell:** Substituting the volume `dV` into our first equation, the number of stars `dN` in this thin shell is:\n    `dN = ρ * 4 * π * d² * dd`\n\n5.  **Introduce parallax (plx):** The question asks about the number of stars per unit range of parallax (`plx`), not distance (`d`). Parallax is inversely proportional to distance:\n    `d = 1 / plx`\n\n6.  **Relate the differential thickness `dd` to the differential parallax `d(plx)`:** To change our expression from being in terms of `d` and `dd` to `plx` and `d(plx)`, we need to find the relationship between `dd` and `d(plx)`. We can do this by differentiating the parallax-distance relation with respect to `plx`:\n    `dd / d(plx) = d/d(plx) * (1 / plx)`\n    Using the power rule of differentiation, this gives:\n    `dd / d(plx) = -1 / plx²`\n    Therefore, `dd = (-1 / plx²) * d(plx)`.\n\n7.  **Substitute `d` and `dd` into the equation for `dN`:** Now we replace `d` with `1/plx` and `dd` with `(-1 / plx²) * d(plx)` in our equation for the number of stars in the shell (`dN = ρ * 4 * π * d² * dd`):\n    `dN = ρ * 4 * π * (1 / plx)² * ((-1 / plx²) * d(plx))`\n    `dN = - (4 * π * ρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n8.  **Find the number of stars per unit range of parallax:** The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is the quantity `dN / d(plx)`. From the equation above, we can rearrange to find this:\n    `dN / d(plx) = - 4 * π * ρ / plx⁴`\n\n9.  **Interpret the result:** The number of stars in a given parallax range must be a positive quantity. The negative sign simply indicates that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. We are interested in the magnitude or the density of stars in a parallax bin. Therefore, we take the absolute value:\n    `|dN / d(plx)| = 4 * π * ρ / plx⁴`\n    Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are constants, we can see the proportionality:\n    `Number of stars per unit parallax range ∝ 1 / plx⁴`\n\nThis means that the number of stars found in a small, fixed-width parallax interval drops very rapidly as we look at smaller and smaller parallaxes (which correspond to greater and greater distances).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Understanding the Premise:** The problem assumes a uniform spatial distribution of stars. This means the number of stars per unit volume is constant throughout space. Let's call this constant number density `ρ`.\n\n2.  **Relating Distance and Parallax:** Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) to a star. The relationship is given by:\n    `d = 1 / plx`\n\n3.  **Counting Stars in a Volume:** We want to find the number of stars (`N`) within a certain volume of space. For a uniform distribution, the number of stars in a given volume (`V`) is simply the volume multiplied by the number density:\n    `N = ρ * V`\n\n4.  **Focusing on a Specific Parallax Range:** The question asks for the number of stars *per unit range of parallax*. This means we need to find how many stars are found in a small interval of parallax, from `plx` to `plx + d(plx)`. This parallax interval corresponds to a specific range of distances.\n\n5.  **Defining the Volume Element:** A small range of parallax `d(plx)` corresponds to a small range of distance `dd`. The stars within this distance range `dd` at a distance `d` will occupy a thin spherical shell.\n    *   The volume of a thin spherical shell of radius `d` and thickness `dd` is given by its surface area multiplied by its thickness: `dV = 4 * π * d² * dd`.\n\n6.  **Calculating the Number of Stars in the Shell:** The number of stars (`dN`) in this thin shell is the volume of the shell (`dV`) multiplied by the constant star density (`ρ`):\n    `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * (4 * π * d² * dd)`\n\n7.  **Expressing the Relationship in Terms of Parallax:** Now, we need to convert our expression from being in terms of distance (`d` and `dd`) to being in terms of parallax (`plx` and `d(plx)`).\n    *   We know `d = 1 / plx`.\n    *   We need to find the relationship between `dd` and `d(plx)`. We can do this by taking the derivative of `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d/d(plx) * (1/plx) = -1 / plx²`\n    *   So, `dd = - (1 / plx²) * d(plx)`.\n    *   The negative sign just indicates that as distance (`d`) increases, parallax (`plx`) decreases.

This means the number density of stars (let's call it ρ) is constant everywhere in 3D space.\n\n3.  **Calculate the number of stars up to a certain distance.**\n    The number of stars (N) within a certain distance (d) is the product of the constant number density (ρ) and the volume of the sphere with radius d.\n    The volume of a sphere is `V = (4/3)πd³`.\n    So, the number of stars within distance d is `N(d) = ρ * V = ρ * (4/3)πd³`.\n\n4.  **Express the number of stars in terms of parallax.**\n    We can substitute the relationship `d = 1/plx` into the equation for N. This gives us the number of stars with a parallax *greater* than a certain value `plx` (since smaller distance `d` means larger parallax `plx`).\n    `N(plx) = ρ * (4/3)π * (1/plx)³ = (4/3)πρ * plx⁻³`.\n\n5.  **Find the number of stars per unit range of parallax.**\n    The question asks how the number of stars *per unit range of parallax* changes with `plx`.

Let's find the number of stars `dN` in a thin spherical shell between distance `d` and `d + dd`.\n    *   This can be found by differentiating `N(d)` with respect to `d`:\n        `dN/dd = d/dd [ρ * (4/3)πd³] = ρ * 4πd²`\n    *   So, the number of stars in the shell of thickness `dd` is:\n        `dN = (ρ * 4πd²) dd`\n    *   This equation tells us that the number of stars in a thin shell at distance `d` is proportional to `d²`.\n\n*   **4. Introducing Parallax:**\n    *   Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance `d`. The standard definition is `plx = 1/d`, where `d` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds.\n    *   From this relationship, we can express `d` in terms of `plx`: `d = 1/plx`.\n\n*   **5. Connecting the differentials of distance and parallax:**\n    *   We need to find how the interval `dd` relates to an interval in parallax, `d(plx)`. We can find this by differentiating the expression `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`.\n    *   `dd / d(plx) = d/d(plx) [1/plx] = -1/plx²`\n    *   Rearranging this gives: `dd = (-1/plx²) d(plx)`\n    *   When considering the number of stars, we are interested in the magnitude of the interval, so we can ignore the negative sign (which just indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases).\n    *   `dd = (1/plx²) d(plx)`\n\n*   **6. Finding the number of stars per unit range of parallax:**\n    *   Now we substitute our expressions for `d` and `dd` back into the equation for `dN` from step 3.\n    *   `dN = (ρ * 4πd²) dd`\n    *   Substitute `d = 1/plx` and `dd = (1/plx²) d(plx)`:\n        `dN = (ρ * 4π * (1/plx)²) * (1/plx²) d(plx)`\n        `dN = (ρ * 4π * 1/plx²) * (1/plx²) d(plx)`\n        `dN = (ρ * 4π / plx⁴) d(plx)`\n\n*   **7. Final result:**\n    *   The question asks for \"how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx\". This is the quantity `dN / d(plx)`.\n    *   From the equation above:\n        `dN / d(plx) = ρ * 4π / plx⁴`\n    *   Since `ρ` (the star density) and `4π` are constants, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n    *   `dN / d(plx) ~ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Key Concepts:**\n    *   **Uniform Distribution of Stars:** This is the core assumption. It means that the number of stars per unit volume is constant throughout space. Let's call this constant number density `ρ`.\n    *   **Parallax (plx):** Parallax is an angular measurement that is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) to a star. For small angles, the relationship is `plx ≈ 1/d`. Therefore, the distance to a star can be expressed as `d ≈ 1/plx`.\n    *   **The Question:** We need to find how \"the number of stars per unit range of parallax\" changes with parallax. This is essentially asking for the distribution function of stars with respect to parallax, which can be written as `dN/d(plx)`, where `N` is the number of stars.\n\n2.  **Relate Number of Stars to Distance:**\n    *   Consider a thin spherical shell of space around the Earth. Let the inner radius of the shell be `d` and the outer radius be `d + dd`, where `dd` is a very small thickness.\n    *   The volume of this thin shell (`dV`) is its surface area multiplied by its thickness: `dV = (4πd²) * dd`.\n    *   Since the stars are uniformly distributed with a density `ρ`, the number of stars (`dN`) within this thin shell is the density multiplied by the volume of the shell:\n        `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd`.\n\n3.  **Convert from Distance to Parallax:**\n    *   Now, we need to express this relationship in terms of parallax (`plx`) instead of distance (`d`). We use the relation `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   We also need to find the relationship between the small thickness `dd` and the corresponding small range of parallax `d(plx)`. We can find this by differentiating `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `d = 1/plx = plx⁻¹`\n        `dd/d(plx) = -1 * plx⁻² = -1/plx²`\n    *   This gives us `dd = -d(plx)/plx²`. The negative sign indicates that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. When we are considering the number of stars in a given range (a magnitude), we can ignore the negative sign. So, `dd = d(plx)/plx²`.\n\n4.  **Substitute and Simplify:**\n    *   Now substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` back into our equation for `dN`:\n        `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (d(plx)/plx²)`\n    *   Let's combine the terms:\n        `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n        `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n5.  **Find the Number of Stars per Unit Parallax:**\n    *   The quantity we are looking for is \"the number of stars per unit range of parallax,\" which is `dN/d(plx)`. We can find this by rearranging the equation from the previous step:\n        `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n    *   Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, we can see the proportionality:\n        `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to the inverse fourth power of the parallax (`1/plx⁴`).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Key Quantities and Assumptions:**\n    *   **Assumption:** Stars are uniformly distributed in space.

The relationship is `plx = 1/d` (where d is in parsecs and plx is in arcseconds). Consequently, `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   **Goal:** We need to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which can be written as `dN/d(plx)`, depends on `plx`.\n\n2.  **Relate the Number of Stars to Distance:**\n    *   Consider a sphere of radius `d` centered on the observer.\n    *   The volume of this sphere is `V = (4/3)πd³`.\n    *   Since the star density `ρ` is constant, the total number of stars `N` within this distance `d` is `N = ρ * V`.\n    *   So, `N(d) = (4/3)πρd³`.\n\n3.  **Find the Number of Stars in a Thin Shell:**\n    *   Now, let's consider the number of stars `dN` in a thin spherical shell between distance `d` and `d + dd`.\n    *   The volume of this thin shell, `dV`, is the surface area of the sphere (`4πd²`) multiplied by the thickness of the shell (`dd`).\n    *   `dV = 4πd² * dd`\n    *   The number of stars in this shell is `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd`.\n\n4.  **Convert from Distance to Parallax:**\n    *   Our expression for `dN` is in terms of `d` and `dd`. We need it in terms of `plx` and `d(plx)`.\n    *   We know `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   We need to find the relationship between the small thickness `dd` and the small parallax interval `d(plx)`. We can get this by differentiating `d` with respect to `plx`.\n    *   `d/d(plx) [1/plx] = d/d(plx) [plx⁻¹] = -1 * plx⁻² = -1/plx²`\n    *   So, `dd/d(plx) = -1/plx²`, which means `dd = - (1/plx²) d(plx)`.\n    *   The negative sign just indicates that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. When we are counting stars in a shell, we only care about the magnitude of the thickness, so we can write `|dd| = (1/plx²) |d(plx)|`.\n\n5.  **Substitute and Solve:**\n    *   Now, substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` back into the equation for `dN`:\n    *   `dN = ρ * 4π * d² * dd`\n    *   `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * ( (1/plx²) d(plx) )`\n    *   Combine the terms:\n    *   `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Find the Final Relationship:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"number of stars per unit range of parallax\", which is `dN/d(plx)`.

We can do this by taking the derivative of `d` with respect to `plx`.\n    *   `d = 1/plx = plx⁻¹`\n    *   `dd/d(plx) = d(plx⁻¹)/d(plx) = -1 * plx⁻² = -1/plx²`\n    *   This gives us the relationship: `dd = (-1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n    *   When we are counting stars, we are interested in the magnitude of the range, not the direction. The negative sign simply indicates that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. So, we'll use the absolute value:\n        `|dd| = (1/plx²) * |d(plx)|`\n\n6.  **Substitute Back into the Number of Stars Equation:**\n    *   Now we substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` into our equation for `dN`:\n        `dN = ρ * 4 * π * d² * dd`\n    *   Substitute `d = 1/plx`:\n        `dN = ρ * 4 * π * (1/plx)² * dd`\n    *   Substitute `dd = (1/plx²) * d(plx)`:\n        `dN = ρ * 4 * π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n    *   Combine the terms:\n        `dN = (4 * π * ρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n7.  **Find the Number of Stars per Unit Parallax Range:**\n    *   The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is the expression `dN/d(plx)`.\n    *   We can find this by dividing both sides of our last equation by `d(plx)`:\n        `dN/d(plx) = 4 * π * ρ / plx⁴`\n\n8.  **Determine the Proportionality:**\n    *   In the final expression, `4`, `π`, and `ρ` (the constant star density) are all constants.\n    *   Therefore, we can see the proportionality:\n        `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\n9.  **Conclusion:** The number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the inverse fourth power of the parallax. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Premise:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in space. This is a crucial starting point. A uniform distribution means that the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ`, is constant everywhere. The number of stars `N` in any given volume `V` is simply `N = ρ * V`.\n\n2.  **Relate the Number of Stars to Distance:** Let's consider a sphere of radius `d` centered on the observer (the Sun). The volume of this sphere is `V = (4/3)πd³`. The total number of stars (`N`) within this distance `d` is:\n    `N(d) = ρ * V = ρ * (4/3)πd³`\n    This shows that the total number of stars up to a certain distance `d` is proportional to the cube of the distance (`N ∝ d³`).\n\n3.  **Introduce Parallax (plx):** Stellar parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) to the star. The relationship is given by:\n    `plx = 1/d`\n    (when `d` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds).\n    From this, we can express the distance in terms of parallax:\n    `d = 1/plx`\n\n4.  **Find the Number of Stars in a Thin Shell:** The question asks for the \"number of stars per unit range of parallax\". This is a rate, which in calculus terms means a derivative. Let's find the number of stars `dN` in a thin spherical shell of space. This shell is between a distance `d` and a slightly larger distance `d + dd`.\n    *   The volume of the thin shell `dV` can be approximated by the surface area of the inner sphere (`4πd²`) times the thickness of the shell (`dd`):\n        `dV = 4πd² * dd`\n    *   The number of stars `dN` in this shell is the density `ρ` times the shell's volume `dV`:\n        `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n\n5.  **Change Variables from Distance to Parallax:** Now we need to express `dN` in terms of parallax `plx`. We have the relationships:\n    *   `d = 1/plx`\n    *   To find the relationship between `dd` and `d(plx)`, we differentiate `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d/d(plx) (1/plx) = -1/plx²`\n        `dd = -(1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n    The negative sign simply indicates that as distance (`d`) increases, parallax (`plx`) decreases. Since we are interested in the number of stars in a range, which must be a positive quantity, we consider the magnitude: `|dd| = (1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n\n6.  **Substitute and Simplify:** Now substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` back into the equation for `dN`:\n    `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n    `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n7.  **Find the Number of Stars per Unit Parallax:** The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is `dN/d(plx)`. From the equation above, we can see:\n    `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are constants, we can see the relationship:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n    This means the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the relationship between parallax and distance.**\n    Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) of a star.

This will give us `N(plx)`, the total number of stars with a parallax *greater than or equal to* `plx` (which corresponds to stars with a distance *less than or equal to* `d`).\n    `N(plx) = ρ * (4/3)π * (1/plx)³ = (4/3)πρ * plx⁻³`\n\n5.  **Determine the number of stars per unit range of parallax.**\n    The question asks for how the \"number of stars per unit range of parallax\" changes with `plx`. This quantity is the differential number count, which can be found by differentiating `N(plx)` with respect to `plx`. Let's call this distribution `n(plx)`. The number of stars in a small parallax interval `d(plx)` is `dN = n(plx) * d(plx)`.\n    So, `n(plx) = |dN/d(plx)|`. We take the absolute value because the number of stars must be a positive quantity, and the derivative will be negative (since `N(plx)` decreases as `plx` increases).\n\n    Let's perform the differentiation:\n    `dN/d(plx) = d/d(plx) [ (4/3)πρ * plx⁻³ ]`\n    `dN/d(plx) = (4/3)πρ * (-3 * plx⁻⁴)`\n    `dN/d(plx) = -4πρ * plx⁻⁴`\n\n    Now, taking the absolute value:\n    `n(plx) = |dN/d(plx)| = 4πρ * plx⁻⁴ = (4πρ) / plx⁴`\n\n6.  **Analyze the final relationship.**\n    The number of stars per unit range of parallax, `n(plx)`, is proportional to `1/plx⁴`, since `4πρ` is a constant.\n    `n(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Assumption:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky.

This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ`, is constant everywhere in space.\n\n2.  **Relate the number of stars to volume and distance:** The number of stars (`N`) in a given volume (`V`) is `N = ρ * V`. If we consider a sphere of radius `d` centered on the observer, the total number of stars within this distance is:\n    `N(d) = ρ * (4/3) * π * d^3`\n\n3.  **Find the number of stars in a thin shell:** We are interested in how the number of stars changes with a property (parallax), so we should look at a differential quantity. Let's find the number of stars (`dN`) in a thin spherical shell at a distance `d` with a small thickness `dd`.\n    The volume of this shell (`dV`) is the surface area of the sphere times its thickness: `dV = 4 * π * d^2 * dd`.\n    Therefore, the number of stars in this shell is:\n    `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4 * π * d^2 * dd`\n\n4.  **Introduce Parallax:** The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax (`plx`), not distance. Parallax is defined as the inverse of the distance (when `d` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds):\n    `plx = 1 / d`  or `d = 1 / plx`\n\n5.  **Connect the differentials:** We need to relate the differential of distance (`dd`) to the differential of parallax (`d(plx)`). We can do this by taking the derivative of `d` with respect to `plx`:\n    `dd / d(plx) = d/d(plx) [1 / plx] = -1 / plx^2`\n    The negative sign simply means that as distance increases, parallax decreases. For number counts, we are interested in the magnitude of the relationship:\n    `|dd| = (1 / plx^2) * |d(plx)|`\n\n6.  **Substitute to find the final relationship:** Now we can substitute our expressions for `d` and `dd` back into the equation for `dN`:\n    `dN = ρ * 4 * π * d^2 * dd`\n    Substitute `d = 1/plx`:\n    `dN = ρ * 4 * π * (1/plx)^2 * dd`\n    Substitute `dd = (1/plx^2) * d(plx)` (using the magnitude):\n    `dN = ρ * 4 * π * (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) * d(plx)`\n    `dN = (4 * π * ρ / plx^4) * d(plx)`\n\n7.  **Find the number of stars per unit parallax:** The question asks for \"the number of stars per unit range of parallax,\" which is the quantity `dN / d(plx)`.

Let's consider a thin spherical shell at a distance `d` with a small thickness `dd`.\n    The number of stars in this shell, `dN`, can be found by differentiating `N(d)` with respect to `d`.\n    `dN = (dN(d)/dd) * dd`\n    `dN = d/dd [ρ * (4/3)πd³] * dd`\n    `dN = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n    This tells us that the number of stars in a shell of thickness `dd` at distance `d` is proportional to `d²`.\n\n4.  **Relate Distance (d) to Parallax (plx):**\n    Stellar parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance (d) to the star. The relationship is:\n    `plx = 1/d`\n    (Assuming `d` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds).\n    This can be rearranged to express distance in terms of parallax:\n    `d = 1/plx`\n\n5.  **Relate the Distance Interval (dd) to the Parallax Interval (d(plx)):**\n    To find how the number of stars varies with parallax, we need to transform the interval `dd` into an interval of parallax, `d(plx)`. We can do this by differentiating the expression for `d` with respect to `plx`:\n    `dd/d(plx) = d/d(plx) [1/plx] = -1/plx²`\n    So, `dd = (-1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n    The negative sign simply indicates that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. Since we are concerned with the number of stars in an interval, we are interested in the magnitude of the relationship:\n    `|dd| = (1/plx²) * |d(plx)|`\n\n6.  **Combine the Expressions:**\n    Now we substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` in terms of `plx` into our equation for `dN`:\n    `dN = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n    Substitute `d = 1/plx` and `dd = (1/plx²) * d(plx)`:\n    `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n    `dN = (ρ * 4π / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n7.  **Find the Number of Stars per Unit Range of Parallax:**\n    The quantity we are looking for is the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is `dN/d(plx)`. From the equation above, we can see:\n    `dN/d(plx) = ρ * 4π / plx⁴`\n\n8.  **Conclusion:**\n    Since ρ, 4, and π are constants, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis result means that there are far more stars at small parallax values (large distances) per unit parallax interval than there are at large parallax values (small distances).\n\nFinal Answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understanding the relationship between distance and parallax:**\n    Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) to a star. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n    `plx = 1/d` or `d = 1/plx`\n    Here, distance `d` is typically measured in parsecs and parallax `plx` in arcseconds.\n\n2.  **Understanding the assumption of uniform distribution:**\n    The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ` (the number of stars per unit volume), is constant everywhere in space.\n\n3.  **Considering the number of stars in a spherical shell:**\n    Let's find the number of stars, `dN`, that have a distance between `d` and `d + dd`. These stars are located in a thin spherical shell of radius `d` and thickness `dd`.\n    The volume of this shell, `dV`, is its surface area multiplied by its thickness:\n    `dV = (Area of sphere) × (thickness) = (4πd²) × dd`\n    The number of stars `dN` in this volume is the density `ρ` multiplied by the volume `dV`:\n    `dN = ρ × dV = ρ × 4πd² × dd`\n\n4.  **Expressing the number of stars in terms of parallax:**\n    Our goal is to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (`dN/d(plx)`) depends on `plx`. To do this, we need to substitute `d` and `dd` with expressions involving `plx` and `d(plx)`.\n    *   We already have `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   To find the relationship between the infinitesimals `dd` and `d(plx)`, we differentiate `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d(1/plx)/d(plx) = -1/plx²`\n        This gives us `dd = - (1/plx²) d(plx)`.\n    *   The negative sign simply indicates that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. Since we are counting stars in a shell, we are interested in the magnitude of the thickness, so we take the absolute value: `|dd| = (1/plx²) d(plx)`.\n\n5.  **Substituting back into the equation for dN:**\n    Now we replace `d` and `dd` in the equation `dN = 4πρd² dd`:\n    `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) d(plx)`\n    `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx⁴) d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Finding the number of stars per unit parallax:**\n    The question asks for \"the number of stars per unit range of parallax\", which is the quantity `dN/d(plx)`. We can find this by rearranging the equation above:\n    `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\n7.  **Determining the proportionality:**\n    Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, we can see the proportionality:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis means the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to the inverse fourth power of the parallax.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere is the reasoning and thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Define the Fundamental Assumption:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. This means the number density of stars, which we'll call `ρ` (rho), is constant everywhere in three-dimensional space. `ρ` has units of (number of stars) / (volume), e.g., stars/parsec³.\n\n2.  **Relate Number of Stars to Volume and Distance:**\n    *   Let's consider the number of stars, `N`, within a sphere of radius `d` centered on Earth.\n    *   The volume of this sphere is `V = (4/3)πd³`.\n    *   Since the density `ρ` is constant, the total number of stars `N` inside this sphere is the density multiplied by the volume:\n        `N = ρ * V = ρ * (4/3)πd³`\n    *   From this, we can see that the total number of stars up to a distance `d` is directly proportional to the cube of the distance: `N ∝ d³`.\n\n3.  **Introduce Parallax:**\n    *   Astronomical parallax (`plx`) is defined as the inverse of the distance (`d`) to a star. The standard formula is `d = 1/plx`, where `d` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds.\n    *   We can rearrange this to `d ∝ 1/plx`.\n\n4.  **Express the Number of Stars as a Function of Parallax:**\n    *   Now, we substitute the relationship between distance and parallax into our equation for the number of stars.\n    *   The number of stars `N` within a distance `d` corresponds to the number of stars that have a parallax *greater than or equal to* `plx`. Why greater? Because a smaller distance means a larger parallax.\n    *   Let `N(>plx)` be the number of stars with parallax greater than or equal to `plx`.\n    *   `N(>plx) ∝ d³ ∝ (1/plx)³ = plx⁻³`.\n\n5.  **Determine the Number of Stars per Unit Range of Parallax:**\n    *   The question asks for \"how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx\".

For simplicity, we can set `k=1`, so `d = 1/plx`.\n\n2.  **Understand the assumption of uniform distribution.**\n    The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ`, is constant everywhere. The number of stars in any given volume `V` is `N = ρ * V`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the number of stars in a thin shell of space.**\n    We want to find the number of stars *per unit range of parallax*. This means we need to find how many stars have a parallax in a specific small range, say between `plx` and `plx + d(plx)`. This parallax range corresponds to a distance range between `d` and `d + dd`.\n\n    Let's consider a thin spherical shell of radius `d` and thickness `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this shell (`dV`) is its surface area multiplied by its thickness: `dV = 4πd² * dd`.\n    *   The number of stars (`dN`) in this shell is the volume of the shell multiplied by the constant star density `ρ`:\n        `dN = ρ * dV = 4πρd² * dd`.\n\n4.  **Express the number of stars in terms of parallax.**\n    Our goal is to find the relationship for `dN/d(plx)`.

This means the number of stars per unit volume is constant throughout space. Let's call this constant number density ρ.\n    *   **Parallax (plx):** Parallax is an angle that is inversely proportional to the distance (d) of a star. The relationship is given by `plx = 1/d` (when `d` is measured in parsecs and `plx` in arcseconds). Consequently, the distance to a star can be expressed as `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   **Target Quantity:** We need to find how the \"number of stars per unit range of parallax\" changes with `plx`. This quantity is a density function, which can be written mathematically as `dN/d(plx)`, where `N` is the number of stars.\n\n2.  **Start with the Number of Stars in a Volume:**\n    *   Let's consider the number of stars (`dN`) located in a thin spherical shell of space.

We can find the relationship between `dd` and `d(plx)` by differentiating the equation `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   Using calculus, we differentiate `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd / d(plx) = d/d(plx) [1/plx] = -1/plx²`\n    *   Rearranging this gives us a substitution for `dd`:\n        `dd = - (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n    *   The negative sign indicates that as distance (`d`) increases, parallax (`plx`) decreases, which is correct. When considering the number of stars in a given positive range of parallax, we are interested in the magnitude.\n\n5.  **Substitute and Combine:** Now we substitute our expressions for `d` and `dd` back into the equation for `dN`.\n    *   Original equation: `dN = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n    *   Substitute `d = 1/plx`: `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * dd`\n    *   Substitute `dd = - (1/plx²) * d(plx)`: `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * [- (1/plx²) * d(plx)]`\n    *   Simplify the expression: `dN = -4πρ * (1/plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Find the Number of Stars per Unit Parallax:** The question asks for \"how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with plx\". This is precisely the term `dN / d(plx)`.\n    *   `dN / d(plx) = -4πρ / plx⁴`\n\n7.  **Final Interpretation:** The term `dN/d(plx)` represents the density of stars as a function of parallax. Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, we can see the proportionality:\n    *   `dN / d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax varies as the inverse fourth power of the parallax.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the relationship between distance and parallax.**\n    Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) to a star.

Let's find the number of stars `dN` in a thin spherical shell at distance `d` with a thickness `dd`.\n    The volume of this shell `dV` is the derivative of the sphere's volume `V` with respect to its radius `d`:\n    `dV = dV/dd * dd = d/dd[(4/3)πd³] * dd = 4πd² dd`\n    The number of stars `dN` in this shell is:\n    `dN = ρ * dV = 4πρd² dd`\n\n5.  **Express the number of stars in terms of parallax.**\n    Now we need to convert this expression from being in terms of `d` and `dd` to being in terms of `plx` and `d(plx)`.\n    We have `d = 1/plx`.\n    We also need to relate `dd` to `d(plx)`. We can find this by differentiating `d` with respect to `plx`:\n    `dd/d(plx) = d/d(plx) [1/plx] = -1/plx²`\n    So, `dd = -d(plx)/plx²`.\n    The negative sign just indicates that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. For counting the number of stars in a given range, we are interested in the magnitude, so we can write `dd = |d(plx)|/plx²`.\n\n6.  **Substitute `d` and `dd` into the equation for `dN`.**\n    `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx)² * (|d(plx)|/plx²) `\n    `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx⁴) * |d(plx)|`\n\n7.  **Find the number of stars per unit range of parallax.**\n    The question asks for \"the number of stars per unit range of parallax\", which is the quantity `dN / |d(plx)|`.\n    From the equation in step 6, we can rearrange to find this:\n    `dN / |d(plx)| = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\n8.  **Conclusion.**\n    Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, the number of stars per unit parallax range is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n\n`Number of stars per unit parallax range ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Define the Assumptions and Goal:**\n    *   **Assumption:** Stars are uniformly distributed in space.

The volume of this sphere is `V = (4/3)πd³`.\n    *   Since the star density `ρ` is constant, the total number of stars `N` inside this sphere is the density multiplied by the volume:\n        `N(d) = ρ * V = (4/3)πρd³`\n\n3.  **Consider a Thin Shell of Stars:**\n    *   We are interested in the number of stars at a specific distance, not the cumulative number up to that distance. Let's consider a thin spherical shell at a distance `d` with a small thickness `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this thin shell `dV` can be found by differentiating the volume `V` with respect to the radius `d`:\n        `dV = d/dd((4/3)πd³) * dd = 4πd² * dd`\n    *   The number of stars `dN` within this thin shell is the density `ρ` times the volume of the shell `dV`:\n        `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n        This tells us that the number of stars in a thin shell of constant thickness `dd` increases with the square of the distance (`d²`).\n\n4.  **Relate Distance to Parallax:**\n    *   The question is about parallax (`plx`), not distance (`d`). The parallax of a star is inversely proportional to its distance. For simplicity in astronomical units, the relation is:\n        `plx = 1/d`  or  `d = 1/plx`\n    *   We need to express the number of stars `dN` in terms of parallax. This means we must substitute `d` and `dd` with their equivalents in terms of `plx` and `d(plx)`.\n\n5.  **Express the differential `dd` in terms of `d(plx)`:**\n    *   We can find the relationship between the small thickness `dd` and the corresponding small range of parallax `d(plx)` by differentiating the equation `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d/d(plx) (1/plx) = -1/plx²`\n    *   So, `dd = (-1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n    *   The negative sign simply indicates that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases.

To do this, we need to substitute `d` and `dd` with expressions involving `plx`.\n    *   From step 1, we have `d = 1 / plx`.\n    *   To find the relationship between the differentials `dd` and `d(plx)`, we differentiate the distance equation with respect to parallax:\n        `dd / d(plx) = d(1/plx) / d(plx) = -1 / plx²`\n    *   This gives us `dd = - (1/plx²) d(plx)`. The negative sign just indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases. When we are counting the number of stars in a range, we are concerned with the magnitude, so we can ignore the negative sign:\n        `|dd| = (1 / plx²) d(plx)`\n\n5.  **Combine the expressions.**\n    Now, substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` into the proportionality for `dN` from step 3:\n    `dN ∝ (1 / plx)² * ( (1 / plx²) d(plx) )`\n    `dN ∝ (1 / plx²) * (1 / plx²) d(plx)`\n    `dN ∝ (1 / plx⁴) d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Find the number of stars per unit range of parallax.**\n    The quantity we are looking for is the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is `dN / d(plx)`.

The volume of this shell (`dV`) is approximately its surface area multiplied by its thickness:\n        `dV = (Area of sphere) * (thickness) = 4 * π * d² * dd`\n    3.  The number of stars (`dN`) in this thin shell is the density (`ρ`) multiplied by the volume of the shell (`dV`):\n        `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4 * π * d² * dd`\n    4.  **Express in terms of parallax:** Now we need to switch from the variable `d` to `plx`. We use the relationship `d = 1/plx`.\n    5.  We also need to find the relationship between the small thickness `dd` and a small range of parallax `d(plx)`. We can do this by taking the derivative of `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `d(d)/d(plx) = d/d(plx) (1/plx) = -1/plx²`\n        This gives us `dd = (-1/plx²) * d(plx)`. The negative sign just means that as distance (`d`) increases, parallax (`plx`) decreases. Since we are interested in the number of stars in a given range (a magnitude), we can ignore the negative sign.\n        `dd = (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n    6.  **Substitute back into the equation for dN:** Now we substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` in terms of `plx` back into our equation for `dN`:\n        `dN = ρ * 4 * π * d² * dd`\n        `dN = ρ * 4 * π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n        `dN = ρ * 4 * π * (1/plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n    7.  **Find the number per unit parallax:** The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is `dN/d(plx)`. We can find this by dividing our equation by `d(plx)`:\n        `dN / d(plx) = ρ * 4 * π * (1/plx⁴)`\n    8.  **Conclusion:** Since `ρ`, `4`, and `π` are all constants, we can see the relationship:\n        `dN / d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThe number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 49:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Fundamental Assumptions:**\n    *   **Uniform Star Distribution:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. In a three-dimensional context, this means the number density of stars, denoted by ρ (the number of stars per unit volume), is constant everywhere in space.\n    *   **Parallax and Distance:** Stellar parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) to the star. The standard definition is `plx = 1/d` where `d` is measured in parsecs and `plx` in arcseconds. For our derivation, the constant of proportionality doesn't matter, so we can use `d = 1/plx`.\n\n2.  **Counting Stars in a Volume of Space:**\n    *   Let's consider the number of stars at a distance between `d` and `d + dd` from us. These stars occupy a thin spherical shell.\n    *   The volume of a sphere of radius `d` is `V = (4/3)πd³`.\n    *   The volume of the thin spherical shell (`dV`) with radius `d` and thickness `dd` is the surface area of the sphere multiplied by its thickness: `dV = 4πd² * dd`.\n    *   Since the star density (ρ) is constant, the number of stars (`dN`) in this shell is the density multiplied by the volume of the shell:\n        `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n\n3.  **Transforming from Distance to Parallax:**\n    *   The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax (`dN/d(plx)`), not per unit range of distance. So, we need to express our equation for `dN` in terms of `plx`.\n    *   We have two substitutions to make: one for `d` and one for `dd`.\n    *   From `d = 1/plx`, we can substitute for `d`.\n    *   To substitute for `dd`, we need to find the relationship between the differential elements `dd` and `d(plx)`. We can do this by differentiating `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d/d(plx) (1/plx) = -1/plx²`\n    *   This gives us `dd = - (1/plx²) * d(plx)`. When counting the number of stars, we are interested in the magnitude of the interval, so we can ignore the negative sign (it just signifies that as distance increases, parallax decreases).\n        `|dd| = (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n\n4.  **Deriving the Final Relation:**\n    *   Now we substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` into our equation for `dN`:\n        `dN = ρ * 4π * d² * dd`\n        `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * ( (1/plx²) * d(plx) )`\n    *   Combine the terms involving `plx`:\n        `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n    *   To find the number of stars per unit range of parallax, we divide by `d(plx)`:\n        `dN/d(plx) = (4πρ) / plx⁴`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are constants, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (`dN/d(plx)`) is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n    *   `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~ 1/plx³\nB) ~ 1/plx⁴\nC) ~ 1/plx²\nD) ~ 1/plx¹\n\nOur derived relationship matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Define the initial assumption:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ`, is constant everywhere. `ρ` = (Number of stars) / (Unit Volume).\n\n2.  **Consider the number of stars in a spherical shell:** Let's find the number of stars, `dN`, located in a thin spherical shell of space. This shell is between a distance `d` from the observer and a slightly larger distance `d + dd`.\n    *   The volume of this thin shell, `dV`, can be approximated by its surface area multiplied by its thickness.\n    *   Surface area of a sphere of radius `d` is `A = 4πd^2`.\n    *   Thickness of the shell is `dd`.\n    *   So, the volume of the shell is `dV = 4πd^2 dd`.\n    *   Since the star density `ρ` is constant, the number of stars `dN` in this shell is `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd^2 dd`.\n\n3.  **Relate distance (d) to parallax (plx):** Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. The standard formula is `plx = 1/d` (when `plx` is in arcseconds and `d` is in parsecs). From this, we can express the distance `d` in terms of parallax: `d = 1/plx`.\n\n4.  **Relate the differential elements (dd and d(plx)):** The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of *parallax*, which is `dN/d(plx)`. Our current expression for `dN` involves `dd`. We need to convert `dd` into terms of `d(plx)`. We can do this by differentiating the relationship `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`:\n    *   `dd / d(plx) = d/d(plx) [1/plx] = -1/plx^2`.\n    *   Therefore, `dd = - (1/plx^2) d(plx)`.\n    *   The negative sign indicates that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. When we are considering the number of stars in an interval, we are interested in the magnitude, so we can ignore the negative sign for this part of the derivation. Thus, we use `dd = (1/plx^2) d(plx)`.\n\n5.  **Substitute to get the distribution in terms of parallax:** Now we substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` back into our equation for `dN`:\n    *   Original equation: `dN = ρ * 4πd^2 dd`\n    *   Substitute `d = 1/plx`: `dN = ρ * 4π(1/plx)^2 dd`\n    *   Substitute `dd = (1/plx^2) d(plx)`: `dN = ρ * 4π(1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) d(plx)`\n    *   Simplify the expression: `dN = (4πρ / plx^4) d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Find the number of stars per unit range of parallax:** The question asks for how the \"number of stars per unit range of parallax\" changes with `plx`. This is exactly the term `dN/d(plx)`.\n    *   From our last equation, we can see that: `dN / d(plx) = 4πρ / plx^4`.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The term `4πρ` is a constant because we assumed a uniform star density `ρ`. Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx^4`.\n\nThis means that there are vastly more stars with very small parallaxes (which are very far away) per parallax interval than there are stars with large parallaxes (which are very close).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\nHere is the reasoning and thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the relationship between the number of stars per unit parallax range (`dN/d(plx)`) and the parallax (`plx`) itself.\n\n2.  **State the Core Assumption:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `n` (number of stars per unit volume), is constant everywhere.\n\n3.  **Relate Number of Stars to Volume:** If the star density `n` is constant, then the number of stars `N` in any given volume `V` is simply `N = n * V`.\n\n4.  **Consider a Relevant Volume:** We are interested in how the number of stars changes with parallax. Since parallax is related to distance, it's natural to consider the number of stars within a thin shell of space at a certain distance. Let's consider a thin spherical shell with radius `d` and thickness `dd` centered on the observer (Earth).\n\n5.  **Calculate the Volume of the Shell:** The volume `dV` of this thin spherical shell is its surface area multiplied by its thickness.\n    *   Surface area of a sphere of radius `d` is `A = 4πd²`.\n    *   Volume of the shell is `dV = A * dd = 4πd² dd`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Number of Stars in the Shell:** The number of stars `dN` in this thin shell is the star density `n` times the shell's volume `dV`.\n    *   `dN = n * dV = n * (4πd² dd)`\n\n7.  **Introduce Parallax:** The key is to switch from the variable of distance (`d`) to the variable of parallax (`plx`).\n    *   The relationship between parallax `plx` (in arcseconds) and distance `d` (in parsecs) is `plx = 1/d`.\n    *   This also means `d = 1/plx`.\n\n8.  **Convert the Differentials:** We have `dN` in terms of `dd`, but we need it in terms of `d(plx)` to find the quantity `dN/d(plx)`. We can find the relationship between `dd` and `d(plx)` by differentiating the equation `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`.\n    *   `d/d(plx) [d] = d/d(plx) [1/plx]`\n    *   `dd/d(plx) = -1/plx²`\n    *   Therefore, `dd = -(1/plx²) d(plx)`.\n\n9.  **Interpret the Negative Sign:** The negative sign simply means that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. Since we are calculating a *number* of stars in a given (positive) range of parallax, we are interested in the magnitude. So, we can take the absolute value: `|dd| = (1/plx²) d(plx)`.\n\n10. **Substitute and Simplify:** Now, substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` back into the equation for `dN`:\n    *   `dN = n * 4πd² dd`\n    *   Substitute `d = 1/plx`: `dN = n * 4π(1/plx)² dd`\n    *   Substitute `|dd| = (1/plx²) d(plx)`: `dN = n * 4π(1/plx²) * (1/plx²) d(plx)`\n    *   Combine the terms: `dN = (4πn) * (1/plx⁴) d(plx)`\n\n11. **Find the Final Relationship:** The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is the expression `dN/d(plx)`. We can find this by rearranging the final equation from the previous step.\n    *   `dN/d(plx) = (4πn) / plx⁴`\n\n12. **Conclusion:** The term `4πn` is a constant (since `n` is constant). Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is directly proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n    *   `dN/d(plx) ~ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Fundamental Assumptions:**\n    *   The stars are uniformly distributed in three-dimensional space.

The negative sign simply indicates that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases.

The number density is the number of stars per unit volume.\n    *   `ρ = constant`\n\n3.  **Relate Number of Stars to Distance:** We can calculate the total number of stars, `N`, within a certain distance, `d`, from an observer. Assuming the observer is at the center, the volume of space up to distance `d` is the volume of a sphere with radius `d`.\n    *   Volume `V(d) = (4/3) * π * d^3`\n    *   The total number of stars up to distance `d` is `N(d) = ρ * V(d) = ρ * (4/3) * π * d^3`.\n\n4.  **Find the Number of Stars in a Thin Shell:** We are interested in the number of stars *per unit range* of a variable (in this case, parallax). Let's first find the number of stars per unit range of distance (`dN/dd`). This corresponds to the number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance `d` with a very small thickness `dd`. We can find this by differentiating `N(d)` with respect to `d`.\n    *   `dN/dd = d/dd [ρ * (4/3) * π * d^3]`\n    *   `dN/dd = ρ * (4/3) * π * (3 * d^2) = 4 * π * ρ * d^2`\n    *   This tells us that the number of stars in a thin shell at distance `d` is proportional to `d^2`. `dN/dd ∝ d^2`.\n\n5.  **Introduce Parallax:** Stellar parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) to the star.

So we take the absolute value: `|dd/d(plx)| = 1/plx^2`.\n\n8.  **Combine the results:** Now we substitute these components back into the chain rule equation from step 6.\n    *   `dN/d(plx) ∝ (dN/dd) * |dd/d(plx)|`\n    *   `dN/d(plx) ∝ (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2)`\n    *   `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^4`\n\n**Conclusion:**\nFor a uniform distribution of stars, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx^4`.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the key quantities:**\n    *   **Parallax (plx):** Parallax is an angle that is inversely proportional to the distance (d) of a star. The relationship is `plx = 1/d` (assuming parallax is measured in arcseconds and distance in parsecs). From this, we can write the distance as `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   **Uniform distribution:** This is a crucial assumption. It means that the number density of stars (ρ), which is the number of stars per unit volume, is constant throughout space.\n    *   **Number of stars per unit range of parallax:** This is the quantity we want to find the dependence for. Mathematically, this can be represented as `dN/d(plx)`, where `N` is the number of stars. We want to find how this quantity changes as `plx` changes.\n\n2.  **Formulate the problem:** We need to find the number of stars (`dN`) that lie within a small parallax interval from `plx` to `plx + d(plx)`.\n\n3.  **Translate from parallax to distance:** A parallax interval `[plx, plx + d(plx)]` corresponds to a specific region in space.\n    *   A star with parallax `plx` is at a distance `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   A star with parallax `plx + d(plx)` is at a distance `d' = 1 / (plx + d(plx))`.\n    *   Since `d(plx)` is a small increment, this range of parallaxes corresponds to stars located in a thin spherical shell around the observer.\n\n4.  **Calculate the volume of the spherical shell:**\n    *   The radius of the inner surface of the shell is `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   The thickness of the shell, `dd`, can be found by differentiating `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd = d(1/plx) = (-1/plx^2) d(plx)`\n    *   We are interested in the magnitude of the thickness, so `|dd| = (1/plx^2) d(plx)`.\n    *   The volume of a thin spherical shell (`dV`) is approximately its surface area multiplied by its thickness.\n    *   Surface area of the sphere = `4 * π * d^2`.\n    *   Volume `dV = (Surface Area) * (thickness) = (4 * π * d^2) * |dd|`.\n\n5.  **Substitute the parallax relationships into the volume formula:**\n    *   Replace `d` with `1/plx`.\n    *   Replace `|dd|` with `(1/plx^2) d(plx)`.\n    *   `dV = (4 * π * (1/plx)^2) * (1/plx^2 * d(plx))`\n    *   `dV = (4 * π / plx^2) * (1 / plx^2) * d(plx)`\n    *   `dV = (4 * π / plx^4) * d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the number of stars in this volume:**\n    *   The number of stars (`dN`) in the volume `dV` is the number density (ρ) multiplied by the volume.\n    *   `dN = ρ * dV`\n    *   `dN = ρ * (4 * π / plx^4) * d(plx)`\n\n7.  **Find the number of stars per unit range of parallax:**\n    *   To find the quantity the question asks for (`dN/d(plx)`), we simply divide the expression for `dN` by `d(plx)`.\n    *   `dN / d(plx) = ρ * 4 * π / plx^4`\n    *   Since ρ (number density) and 4π are constants, we can see the proportionality:\n    *   `dN / d(plx) ∝ 1 / plx^4`\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax (`plx`) as `1/plx^4`. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Basic Concepts**\n    *   **Uniform Distribution of Stars:** This assumption means that the number density of stars, denoted by ρ (rho), is constant throughout space. That is, the number of stars in any given volume is proportional to that volume.\n    *   **Parallax (plx):** Stellar parallax is an apparent shift of a nearby star's position against the background of more distant stars as the Earth orbits the Sun. Parallax is inversely proportional to the distance (d) to the star. The relationship is `plx = k/d`, where `k` is a constant. For simplicity in astrophysics (using parsecs for distance and arcseconds for parallax), this relationship is simply `plx = 1/d`. Therefore, `d = 1/plx`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Number of Stars within a certain Distance**\n    *   Let's find the total number of stars, `N(d)`, within a sphere of radius `d` centered on the observer (Earth).\n    *   The volume of this sphere is `V = (4/3)πd³`.\n    *   Since the star density `ρ` is constant, the total number of stars `N(d)` is the density multiplied by the volume:\n        `N(d) = ρ * V = ρ * (4/3)πd³`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Number of Stars in a Thin Shell**\n    *   We are interested in the number of stars *per unit range of parallax*. This means we need to consider how the number of stars changes as parallax changes. It's easier to first find how the number of stars changes with distance and then convert to parallax.\n    *   Let's find the number of stars, `dN`, in a thin spherical shell between distance `d` and `d + dd`.\n    *   The volume of this shell, `dV`, can be found by differentiating the volume of the sphere with respect to its radius `d`:\n        `dV/dd = d/dd [ (4/3)πd³ ] = 4πd²`\n        So, `dV = 4πd² dd`\n    *   The number of stars in this shell is the density times the shell's volume:\n        `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² dd`\n    *   This equation gives us the number of stars found at a distance `d` within a small distance range `dd`.\n\n4.  **Relate the Differential in Distance (`dd`) to the Differential in Parallax (`d(plx)`)**\n    *   We have the relationship `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   We need to find how `dd` relates to `d(plx)`. We can do this by taking the derivative of `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd / d(plx) = d/d(plx) [1/plx] = -1/plx²`\n    *   Rearranging this gives: `dd = -d(plx) / plx²`.\n    *   The negative sign simply indicates that as distance (`d`) increases, parallax (`plx`) decreases. Since we are interested in the *number* of stars, we can consider the magnitude: `|dd| = d(plx) / plx²`.\n\n5.  **Substitute Distance and `dd` with Parallax and `d(plx)`**\n    *   Now we take our expression for `dN` and replace all the terms involving distance (`d` and `dd`) with terms involving parallax (`plx` and `d(plx)`).\n    *   Original expression: `dN = 4πρd² dd`\n    *   Substitute `d = 1/plx`:\n        `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx)² * dd`\n    *   Substitute `dd = d(plx) / plx²` (ignoring the negative sign as we care about the magnitude):\n        `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx²) * (d(plx) / plx²) `\n    *   Simplify the expression:\n        `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Find the Number of Stars per Unit Range of Parallax**\n    *   The question asks for \"how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx\". This quantity is mathematically represented as `dN/d(plx)`.\n    *   From our last equation, we can simply divide by `d(plx)`:\n        `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\n7.  **Conclusion**\n    *   In this final expression, `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants.\n    *   Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n    *   `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the assumptions:**\n    *   The stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number density of stars, ρ (number of stars per unit volume), is a constant.\n    *   We are interested in the number of stars, N, as a function of their parallax, plx.\n\n2.  **Relate Number of Stars to Distance:**\n    *   Let's consider the number of stars up to a certain distance `d` from the observer. The volume of a sphere with radius `d` is `V = (4/3) * π * d³`.\n    *   Since the star density `ρ` is constant, the total number of stars `N` within this volume is `N = ρ * V = ρ * (4/3) * π * d³`.\n\n3.  **Relate Distance to Parallax:**\n    *   Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance (d) to a star. The fundamental relationship is `d = 1/plx` (when `d` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds).\n    *   Substitute this into the equation for `N`:\n        `N(plx) = ρ * (4/3) * π * (1/plx)³ = (4 * π * ρ) / (3 * plx³)`.\n\n4.  **Find the Number of Stars per Unit Range of Parallax:**\n    *   The question asks for how the *number of stars per unit range of parallax* changes. This quantity is the derivative of the number of stars `N` with respect to the parallax `plx`, which is `dN/d(plx)`.\n    *   We need to differentiate the expression `N(plx)` with respect to `plx`.\n        Let `C = (4 * π * ρ) / 3`, which is a constant. Then `N(plx) = C * plx⁻³`.\n    *   Taking the derivative:\n        `dN/d(plx) = d/d(plx) [C * plx⁻³]`\n        `dN/d(plx) = C * (-3 * plx⁻⁴) = -3 * C / plx⁴`\n\n5.  **Interpret the Result:**\n    *   The negative sign indicates that as parallax `plx` increases (meaning the stars are closer), the total cumulative number of stars `N` decreases, which makes sense from our formulation. However, the question is about the *number of stars in a given parallax range*, which is a positive quantity. We are interested in the magnitude of this relationship.\n    *   Substituting the constant `C` back in:\n        `|dN/d(plx)| = | -3 * (4 * π * ρ / 3) / plx⁴ | = (4 * π * ρ) / plx⁴`.\n    *   Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, we can see the proportionality:\n        `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`.\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes as `1/plx⁴`.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 59:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Define the relationship between distance and parallax.**\n    Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance (d) to a star. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n    `plx ∝ 1/d` or `d ∝ 1/plx`\n    For simplicity in calculations, we can write `d = 1/plx` by choosing appropriate units (e.g., distance in parsecs and parallax in arcseconds).\n\n2.  **Model the distribution of stars.**\n    The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ`, is constant everywhere. `ρ` represents the number of stars per unit volume.\n    `ρ = constant`\n\n3.  **Calculate the number of stars in a given volume.**\n    Consider a thin spherical shell of space centered on the observer (Earth). Let the inner radius of the shell be `d` and its thickness be a small amount `dd`.\n    *   The surface area of this sphere is `A = 4πd²`.\n    *   The volume of the thin shell (`dV`) is its surface area multiplied by its thickness: `dV = 4πd² * dd`.\n    *   The number of stars (`dN`) within this thin shell is the volume of the shell multiplied by the constant star density `ρ`:\n        `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n    This equation tells us that the number of stars in a small distance range `dd` at distance `d` is proportional to `d²`.\n\n4.  **Translate the relationship from distance to parallax.**\n    Our goal is to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (`dN/d(plx)`) changes with `plx`. We need to substitute `d` and `dd` in the equation for `dN` with expressions involving `plx` and `d(plx)`.\n    *   We already have `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   We need to find the relationship between `dd` and `d(plx)`. We can do this by taking the derivative of `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d(1/plx)/d(plx) = -1/plx²`\n        Therefore, `dd = -(1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n    *   The negative sign simply indicates that as distance (`d`) increases, parallax (`plx`) decreases. Since we are interested in the number of stars in a given range, we care about the magnitude, so we can ignore the negative sign.\n        `|dd| = (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n\n5.  **Substitute and find the final relationship.**\n    Now, substitute `d = 1/plx` and `|dd| = (1/plx²) * d(plx)` into our equation for `dN`:\n    `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n    `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Interpret the result.**\n    The expression `dN/d(plx)` represents the number of stars per unit range of parallax. From the equation above, we can see:\n    `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n    Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, we find that the number of stars per unit range of parallax is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the parallax.\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 60:\nHere is a thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Core assumption:** Stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number of stars per unit volume (number density, let's call it `ρ`) is a constant everywhere.\n    *   **Core question:** How does the *number of stars per unit range of parallax* (`dN/d(plx)`) change as a function of parallax (`plx`)?\n\n2.  **Establish Relationships:**\n    *   First, we need to relate the number of stars to a spatial volume. For a uniform distribution, the number of stars (`N`) in any given volume (`V`) is `N = ρ * V`.\n    *   Next, we need to relate distance (`d`) to parallax (`plx`). Parallax is defined as the inverse of the distance: `plx = 1/d`. Therefore, `d = 1/plx`. We assume `d` is measured in parsecs and `plx` in arcseconds.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Number of Stars in a Specific Volume:**\n    *   It's easiest to think about stars at a certain distance `d`. Let's consider a thin spherical shell of space with radius `d` and a very small thickness `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this thin shell (`dV`) is its surface area multiplied by its thickness. The surface area of a sphere is `4πd²`.\n    *   So, the volume of the shell is `dV = 4πd² * dd`.\n    *   The number of stars (`dN`) within this thin shell is the number density times the volume of the shell:\n        `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd`.\n\n4.  **Translate from Distance to Parallax:**\n    *   Our current expression for `dN` is in terms of distance (`d` and `dd`). The question asks for the relationship with parallax (`plx`). So, we need to substitute `d` and `dd` with expressions involving `plx`.\n    *   We already know `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   We need to find the relationship between the small thickness `dd` and the corresponding small range of parallax `d(plx)`. We can find this by differentiating the equation `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`.\n    *   Using calculus, `dd/d(plx) = d/d(plx) [1/plx] = -1/plx²`.\n    *   This tells us how a small change in parallax relates to a small change in distance. For our purposes, we are interested in the number of stars in an interval, so we can consider the magnitude: `dd = |d(plx)| / plx²`. This shows that for a fixed parallax interval `d(plx)`, the corresponding distance interval `dd` gets larger for smaller parallaxes (larger distances).\n\n5.  **Combine and Solve:**\n    *   Now, we substitute our parallax-based expressions back into the equation for `dN`.\n    *   Start with: `dN = ρ * 4πd² * dd`.\n    *   Substitute `d = 1/plx`: `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * dd`.\n    *   Substitute `dd = d(plx) / plx²`: `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (d(plx) / plx²)`.\n    *   Let's simplify this expression: `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n    *   `dN = (ρ * 4π / plx^4) * d(plx)`.\n\n6.  **Interpret the Result:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"number of stars per unit range of parallax\", which is `dN / d(plx)`.\n    *   From our final equation, we can rearrange to get this quantity:\n        `dN / d(plx) = (ρ * 4π) / plx^4`.\n    *   Since `ρ`, `4`, and `π` are all constants, we can see the proportionality:\n        `dN / d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^4`.\n\n7.  **Match to the Options:**\n    *   This result directly matches option C.\n    *   A) ~ 1/plx²\n    *   B) ~ 1/plx¹\n    *   C) ~ 1/plx⁴\n    *   D) ~ 1/plx³\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with `plx` as `~ 1/plx^4`.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>."
