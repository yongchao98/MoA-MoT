This is equivalent to 0.1428.\n*   The mass fraction can be expressed as: `(mass of H) / (total mass) = (y * 1.008) / (x * 12.011 + y * 1.008)`. For simplicity, we can use atomic masses of H=1 and C=12.\n*   `y / (12x + y) = 0.1428`\n*   The fraction 1/7 is approximately 0.142857, which is a very close match. So, let's assume `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`.\n*   `7y = 12x + y`\n*   `6y = 12x`\n*   `y = 2x`\n*   This means the empirical formula of Z is (CH2)n, and the molecular formula is CnH2n.\n*   The problem states that Z is formed from hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a saturated hydrocarbon.\n*   A saturated hydrocarbon with the general formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n*   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. The most common and stable cycloalkane used as a solvent is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n*   Let's check the hydrogen mass fraction for cyclohexane: H% = (12 * 1) / (6 * 12 + 12 * 1) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%. This confirms that Z is very likely cyclohexane.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n*   It does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated or aromatic. Benzene, despite being unsaturated, does not react with bromine water under normal conditions due to its aromatic stability.\n*   Z (cyclohexane, C6H12) is a constituent of mixture Y. So, one component of Y is cyclohexane.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n*   Let the two components of Y be Y1 and Y2. We have Y1 = cyclohexane (C6H12).\n*   When mixture Y is hydrogenated, Y1 (cyclohexane) does not react. Y2 must hydrogenate to form cyclohexane.\n*   Since Y2 does not decolorize bromine water, it could be another saturated C6 isomer or an aromatic compound. If it were a saturated isomer like methylcyclopentane, severe hydrogenation would cause ring-opening to form alkanes (like n-hexane or methylpentane), not just cyclohexane. This contradicts the condition that *only* Z is formed.\n*   The most plausible candidate for Y2 is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene does not decolorize bromine water and its hydrogenation yields cyclohexane: `C6H6 + 3H2 --(Pt)--> C6H12`.\n*   So, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Components of Mixture X and Solve the Problem**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2.\n*   When heated with platinum, X undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form Y. A disproportionation in this context involves hydrogen transfer, where one component is oxidized (loses hydrogen) and the other is reduced (gains hydrogen).\n*   The reaction is: `X1 + X2 --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 + C6H6`. Since the products are equimolar, the stoichiometry is 1:1 on both sides.\n*   From the law of conservation of mass, we can balance the atoms.\n    *   Carbon: C atoms in (X1 + X2) = C atoms in (C6H12 + C6H6) = 6 + 6 = 12.\n    *   Hydrogen: H atoms in (X1 + X2) = H atoms in (C6H12 + C6H6) = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This implies that both X1 and X2 must have a six-carbon ring structure. So, their formulas are C6Hx and C6Hy.\n*   We know `x + y = 18`.\n*   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, meaning X1 and X2 are unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds).\n*   There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of X.\n*   Let's consider possible non-conjugated, unsaturated C6-ring compounds:\n    *   **Cyclohexene (C6H10)**: One double bond. Non-conjugated.\n    *   **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**: Two double bonds, which are not conjugated.\n    *   (1,3-Cyclohexadiene has conjugated bonds, so it is ruled out).\n*   Let's test if these two compounds fit our hydrogen count:\n    *   If X1 = Cyclohexene (C6H10) and X2 = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our requirement.\n*   The disproportionation reaction would be:\n    `C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) + C6H10 (cyclohexene) --> C6H6 (benzene) + C6H12 (cyclohexane)`\n    In this reaction, the diene is oxidized to benzene by losing 2H, and the cyclohexene is reduced to cyclohexane by gaining 2H. This is a plausible catalytic hydrogen transfer.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n\nTotal H atoms = (H atoms in C6H10) + (H atoms in C6H8) = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon, and the mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%.\n*   We can test the general formulas for hydrocarbons. For a saturated hydrocarbon, the formula is CnH(2n+2) (alkane) or CnH2n (cycloalkane).\n*   Let's calculate the mass fraction of hydrogen for a cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n    *   Molar mass of C ≈ 12 g/mol\n    *   Molar mass of H ≈ 1 g/mol\n    *   Molar mass of CnH2n ≈ 12n + 2n = 14n\n    *   Mass of hydrogen = 2n\n    *   Mass fraction of H = (2n) / (14n) = 2/14 = 1/7\n*   Converting 1/7 to a percentage: (1/7) * 100% ≈ 14.2857%. This is a perfect match for the given 14.28%.\n*   Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane with the general formula CnH2n.\n*   The problem states that Z is widely used as a solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n*   The fact that Z does not react further with hydrogen confirms it is a saturated compound like a cycloalkane.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n*   Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are either saturated (alkanes/cycloalkanes) or aromatic.\n*   Z (cyclohexane, C6H12) is a constituent of mixture Y. So, one component is cyclohexane.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives *only* Z (cyclohexane). Let Y = (Cyclohexane + Compound D).\n    *   Cyclohexane does not react with hydrogen.\n    *   So, hydrogenation of Compound D must produce cyclohexane.\n    *   Compound D must also not decolorize bromine water.\n*   If D were a saturated isomer of cyclohexane (like methylcyclopentane), it would have a different carbon skeleton. While severe hydrogenation might cause rearrangement, a more direct interpretation is needed.\n*   Let's consider D being an aromatic compound. Aromatic compounds do not decolorize bromine water under standard test conditions but can be hydrogenated.\n*   The only aromatic hydrocarbon with a six-carbon skeleton is **benzene (C6H6)**.\n*   Let's check if this fits:\n    *   Hydrogenation of benzene: C6H6 + 3H2 --(Pt, severe)--> C6H12 (cyclohexane). This is a well-known reaction.\n    *   Therefore, the hydrogenation of a mixture of benzene and cyclohexane would yield only cyclohexane.\n*   So, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **benzene (C6H6)** and **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Components of Mixture X**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n*   X decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This implies that both A and B must have a six-carbon ring skeleton.\n*   There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of mixture X.\n*   The reaction from X to Y is a disproportionation reaction on a platinum catalyst:\n    A + B --(Pt, heat)--> Benzene (C6H6) + Cyclohexane (C6H12)\n*   Since X and Y are both equimolar mixtures, the reaction stoichiometry must be 1:1 -> 1:1.\n*   This reaction is an intermolecular hydrogen transfer. One molecule (the hydrogen donor) is dehydrogenated to benzene, and the other (the hydrogen acceptor) is hydrogenated to cyclohexane.\n*   Let's analyze the hydrogen balance for the reaction:\n    Total H atoms in reactants = Total H atoms in products\n    H(A) + H(B) = H(Benzene) + H(Cyclohexane)\n    H(A) + H(B) = 6 + 12 = 18\n*   Now we need to find two unsaturated C6-ring compounds (A and B) that are not conjugated and have a total of 18 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Possible unsaturated C6-ring compounds:\n        *   **Cyclohexene (C6H10)**: Has 10 H atoms. It is not conjugated.\n        *   Cyclohexa-1,3-diene (C6H8): Has 8 H atoms, but its double bonds are conjugated. The problem states there are no conjugated bonds, so this is ruled out.\n        *   **Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)**: Has 8 H atoms. Its double bonds are separated by two CH2 groups, so they are not conjugated. This is a valid candidate.\n*   Let's see if A = Cyclohexene and B = Cyclohexa-1,4-diene fit the criteria.\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms = H(C6H10) + H(C6H8) = 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our required hydrogen balance.\n    *   The reaction would be:\n        C6H8 (Cyclohexa-1,4-diene) + C6H10 (Cyclohexene) --> C6H6 (Benzene) + C6H12 (Cyclohexane)\n        The diene loses 2 hydrogens to become benzene, and the cyclohexene gains those 2 hydrogens to become cyclohexane. This is a chemically plausible disproportionation (catalytic hydrogen transfer).\n*   Therefore, the two liquids in mixture X are **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms**\n\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n*   Number of H atoms in cyclohexene (C6H10) = 10\n*   Number of H atoms in cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8) = 8\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Determine the chemical formula and structure of hydrocarbon Z.**\n\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n*   Let the chemical formula of Z be CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula: `mass % H = (y * Ar(H)) / (x * Ar(C) + y * Ar(H))`, where Ar is the atomic mass.\n*   Using Ar(H) ≈ 1 and Ar(C) ≈ 12: `0.1428 = y / (12x + y)`.\n*   The value 0.1428 is very close to 1/7. So, `1/7 = y / (12x + y)`.\n*   This gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n*   The empirical formula of Z is CH2, and its general formula is CnH2n.\n*   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen and is formed by the hydrogenation of other compounds. This means Z must be a saturated compound. A hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n that is saturated must be a cycloalkane.\n*   The problem also states that hydrogenation of both mixtures X and Y gives *only* one substance, Z. This implies that all the compounds in mixtures X and Y share the same carbon skeleton.\n*   As we will see later, the reaction involves benzene (C6H6). Hydrogenation of benzene produces cyclohexane (C6H12). This strongly suggests that the carbon skeleton is a six-membered ring.\n*   Therefore, Z must be cyclohexane, C6H12. Let's check the mass fraction of hydrogen in cyclohexane: `(12 * 1.008) / (6 * 12.011 + 12 * 1.008) = 12.096 / 84.162 ≈ 0.1437`, which is close enough to 14.28% considering rounding. The `y=2x` derivation is more definitive.\n*   Cyclohexane is also widely used as a solvent, which matches the description.\n\n**2. Determine the components of mixture Y.**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (let's call them C and D) that does not decolorize bromine water.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n*   Z (cyclohexane) is itself a constituent of mixture Y. So, let C = cyclohexane (C6H12).\n*   Cyclohexane is saturated and does not decolorize bromine water, which is consistent.\n*   The other component, D, must also hydrogenate to form cyclohexane. This means D must have a C6 ring skeleton.\n*   D must not decolorize bromine water. This rules out unsaturated compounds like cyclohexene or cyclohexadienes. This leaves saturated or aromatic compounds.\n*   Since D must be different from C (cyclohexane), the only plausible candidate is an aromatic compound: benzene (C6H6). Benzene does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions and can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane (C6H6 + 3H2 → C6H12).\n*   Therefore, mixture Y consists of equimolar amounts of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n**3. Determine the components of mixture X.**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (A and B) that is converted to mixture Y upon heating with platinum. The reaction is described as a disproportionation.\n*   The overall transformation is: Mixture X → Mixture Y.\n*   Since X and Y are equimolar mixtures, the reaction can be written as: `A + B → C + D`\n*   Substituting the components of Y, we get: `A + B → Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)`.\n*   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One molecule is hydrogenated (gains H) and another is dehydrogenated (loses H). The total number of C and H atoms must be conserved.\n*   Total atoms in products: C = 6+6=12, H = 12+6=18.\n*   Therefore, the two molecules A and B from mixture X must together contain 12 carbon atoms and 18 hydrogen atoms. Since they both have a C6 skeleton, their formulas must be C6Hx and C6Hy, where `x + y = 18`.\n*   Now let's use the properties of mixture X:\n    *   It decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and B must contain C=C double bonds.\n    *   There are no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   Hydrogenation of X gives only cyclohexane, confirming the C6 ring skeleton for both A and B.\n*   Let's identify possible structures for A and B. They must be unsaturated C6 ring compounds.\n    *   **Cyclohexene (C6H10)**: Contains one double bond, not conjugated. It decolorizes bromine water. This is a possible candidate. (Number of H = 10).\n    *   **1,3-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**: Contains two double bonds, but they are conjugated. The problem statement explicitly excludes this.\n    *   **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**: Contains two isolated (non-conjugated) double bonds. It decolorizes bromine water. This is a possible candidate. (Number of H = 8).\n*   Let's test the pair A = Cyclohexene (C6H10) and B = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n*   The total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. This matches the requirement from the reaction stoichiometry.\n*   All other conditions are met: equimolar mixture of two C6-ring liquids, both decolorize bromine water, no conjugated bonds, and the reaction `C6H10 + C6H8 → C6H12 + C6H6` represents a valid hydrogen transfer.\n\n**4. Calculate the final answer.**\n\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   This is the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of the first liquid (Cyclohexene, C6H10) and one molecule of the second liquid (1,4-Cyclohexadiene, C6H8).\n*   Total hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the molecular formula of hydrocarbon Z.**\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon that is the final product of hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen. This indicates that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon, which can be either an alkane (general formula CnH2n+2) or a cycloalkane (general formula CnH2n).\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is given as 14.28%. Let's test the general formulas using integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1) for simplicity, as is common in such problems.\n    *   For an alkane (CnH2n+2):\n        Mass % H = (Mass of H) / (Total Mass) = (2n + 2) / (12n + 2n + 2) = (2n + 2) / (14n + 2).\n        If we set this to 14.28% (which is approximately 1/7), we get:\n        (2n + 2) / (14n + 2) = 1/7\n        7 * (2n + 2) = 1 * (14n + 2)\n        14n + 14 = 14n + 2\n        14 = 2, which is a contradiction. Therefore, Z cannot be an alkane.\n    *   For a cycloalkane (CnH2n):\n        Mass % H = (Mass of H) / (Total Mass) = (2n) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 2/14 = 1/7.\n        1/7 ≈ 0.142857, which corresponds to 14.28%. This is a match.\n*   So, Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n. The problem also states that Z is \"widely used as a solvent\". The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane, which has the formula C6H12. This fits the general formula CnH2n for n=6. We can confidently identify Z as **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the components of mixture Y.**\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of mixture Y. So, one liquid in Y is cyclohexane (C6H12).\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane). Let the other liquid in Y be D.\n    *   Hydrogenation of cyclohexane gives cyclohexane (no reaction).\n    *   Hydrogenation of D must also give cyclohexane. This implies that D has the same six-carbon cyclic skeleton as cyclohexane.\n*   Since D does not decolorize bromine water, it cannot have any C=C double bonds in a ring or side chain. The only remaining possibility for a C6 cyclic compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane and doesn't react with bromine water is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene only reacts with Br2 in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst, not with aqueous bromine water.\n*   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the components of mixture X.**\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n*   X decolorizes bromine water, meaning both A and B contain one or more C=C double bonds.\n*   Heating X with platinum causes a disproportionation reaction to form Y. Disproportionation in this context is a hydrogen transfer reaction. The overall reaction is:\n    A + B → Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)\n*   Since the products have a C6 ring, and hydrogenation of X also yields only cyclohexane, both A and B must be C6 cyclic hydrocarbons.\n*   The reaction is a transfer of hydrogen atoms. Let's look at the atom balance. The products are C6H12 and C6H6. The reactants A and B must collectively have C12H18 (12 carbon atoms and 18 hydrogen atoms). Since A and B are both C6 compounds, their formulas must be C6Hx and C6Hy, where x + y = 18.\n*   A and B are unsaturated cyclic C6 hydrocarbons. The most common ones are cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n*   Let's check if their hydrogen counts sum to 18: 10 + 8 = 18. This fits perfectly.\n*   So, the components of mixture X are **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n*   The disproportionation reaction is:\n    C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (cyclohexadiene) --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)\n    In this reaction, cyclohexene is reduced to cyclohexane (gains 2H), and cyclohexadiene is oxidized to benzene (loses 2H). This is a valid hydrogen transfer.\n*   The final condition is that \"There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X\".\n    *   Cyclohexene has only one double bond, so there is no conjugation.\n    *   Cyclohexadiene has two isomers: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (which has conjugated double bonds) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (which has isolated, non-conjugated double bonds).\n    *   To satisfy the condition, the diene must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final answer.**\n*   Mixture X consists of two liquids: cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of cyclohexene = 10.\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of 1,4-cyclohexadiene = 8.\n*   The total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z.**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n    *   The general formula for a hydrocarbon is CxHy.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula: `%H = (mass of H) / (total mass) = (y * 1.008) / (x * 12.011 + y * 1.008)`.\n    *   Using approximate atomic masses (H=1, C=12): `0.1428 = y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   Rearranging the equation: `0.1428 * (12x + y) = y` -> `1.7136x + 0.1428y = y` -> `1.7136x = 0.8572y`.\n    *   The ratio `y/x = 1.7136 / 0.8572 ≈ 2`.\n    *   So, the empirical formula of Z is CH2, and the general molecular formula is CnH2n.\n    *   Hydrocarbons with the formula CnH2n are either alkenes or cycloalkanes.\n    *   The problem states that Z is formed by hydrogenation and \"does not react further with hydrogen\". This means Z is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Z is also described as a \"widely used as a solvent\". Cyclohexane (C6H12) is a very common cycloalkane solvent. Let's check its formula and H percentage:\n        *   Formula: C6H12. This fits CnH2n with n=6.\n        *   %H = (12 * 1) / (6 * 12 + 12) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%. This matches perfectly.\n    *   So, we can confidently identify **Z as Cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Hydrogenation Reactions.**\n    *   The problem states that hydrogenation of *both* mixture X (components A and B) and mixture Y (components C and D) under severe conditions gives *only* substance Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   This means that hydrogenation of each of the four substances (A, B, C, D) must yield cyclohexane.\n    *   `Hydrogenation(A) -> Cyclohexane`\n    *   `Hydrogenation(B) -> Cyclohexane`\n    *   `Hydrogenation(C) -> Cyclohexane`\n    *   `Hydrogenation(D) -> Cyclohexane`\n    *   This implies that all four substances A, B, C, and D must have the same carbon skeleton: a six-membered ring. Any side chains or different ring structures would yield different products upon hydrogenation. For example, hydrogenation of methylcyclopentane yields methylcyclopentane, not cyclohexane (though isomerization can occur under specific reforming conditions, the problem implies a common skeleton for all precursors).\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture Y and the Disproportionation Reaction.**\n    *   Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, C and D.\n    *   Y \"does not decolorize bromine water\". This means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of Y. Let's say **C = Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12)**. Cyclohexane is saturated and fits this description.\n    *   What is D? D must also have a C6 ring skeleton, and its hydrogenation must yield cyclohexane. It also must not decolorize bromine water. The most common chemical species that fits this description is **Benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene is aromatic and does not react with bromine water. Hydrogenation of benzene under severe conditions (high pressure/temperature) yields cyclohexane.\n    *   So, **Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of Cyclohexane (C6H12) and Benzene (C6H6)**.\n    *   This mixture Y is formed by a \"disproportionation\" reaction when mixture X is heated with platinum. Disproportionation in this context refers to a hydrogen transfer reaction. One molecule is reduced (gains hydrogen) and another is oxidized (loses hydrogen).\n    *   The reaction is: `Mixture X (A+B) -> Mixture Y (C+D)`\n    *   Substituting the identified compounds: `A + B -> Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)`.\n    *   Since Y is an equimolar mixture, the stoichiometry is 1:1.\n\n4.  **Identify the Components of Mixture X.**\n    *   The reaction is `A + B -> C6H12 + C6H6`. By conservation of atoms, the total composition of A+B must be C12H18.\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B. Both must have a C6-ring skeleton. So, A = C6Hx and B = C6Hy.\n    *   From `A+B = C12H18`, we have `x + y = 18`.\n    *   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds).\n    *   The problem states there are \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" in the molecules of X.\n    *   Let's consider possible unsaturated C6-ring molecules:\n        *   Cyclohexene (C6H10). It has one double bond, so no conjugation issue.\n        *   Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8). It has two non-conjugated double bonds.\n        *   Cyclohexa-1,3-diene (C6H8). It has conjugated double bonds, so it is ruled out.\n    *   Let's test the combination of A = Cyclohexene and B = Cyclohexa-1,4-diene.\n    *   The sum of hydrogen atoms is `10 + 8 = 18`. This matches our requirement `x+y=18`.\n    *   The proposed disproportionation reaction is:\n        `C6H10 (Cyclohexene) + C6H8 (Cyclohexa-1,4-diene) --Pt, heat--> C6H12 (Cyclohexane) + C6H6 (Benzene)`\n    *   In this reaction, cyclohexene (C6H10) is reduced by gaining 2H to become cyclohexane (C6H12). Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8) is oxidized by losing 2H to become benzene (C6H6). This is a valid hydrogen transfer disproportionation.\n    *   Thus, **Mixture X consists of Cyclohexene (C6H10) and Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer.**\n    *   The question asks for the \"total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X\".\n    *   This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of the first liquid (Cyclohexene) and one molecule of the second liquid (Cyclohexa-1,4-diene).\n    *   Number of H atoms in Cyclohexene (C6H10) = 10.\n    *   Number of H atoms in Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8) = 8.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z.**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in a hydrocarbon CₓHᵧ is given by (y × Ar(H)) / (x × Ar(C) + y × Ar(H)), where Ar are the atomic weights.\n    *   Let's use approximate atomic weights for simplicity: Ar(H) ≈ 1 and Ar(C) ≈ 12.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%, which is very close to 1/7 (1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857).\n    *   So, we have the equation: y / (12x + y) = 1/7.\n    *   Rearranging this gives: 7y = 12x + y, which simplifies to 6y = 12x, or y = 2x.\n    *   This means the empirical formula of Z is CH₂, and the general formula is CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a saturated hydrocarbon. A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ that is saturated must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   We are also told that Z is widely used as a solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent that fits this description is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This is a very strong candidate for Z.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y.**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n    *   One of the components of Y is Z, which we've identified as cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). Let's call the other component B. So, Y = {Cyclohexane, B}.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means the hydrogenation of B must also yield cyclohexane.\n    *   This implies that B must also have a six-carbon skeleton.\n    *   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water. Cyclohexane is saturated and does not react. For B not to react with bromine water, it must either be saturated or aromatic (aromatic compounds like benzene do not react with bromine water without a catalyst).\n    *   Since B can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane, it cannot be saturated. Therefore, B must be an aromatic compound.\n    *   The aromatic compound with a six-carbon skeleton that hydrogenates to cyclohexane is **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n    *   So, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)** and **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction from Mixture X to Mixture Y.**\n    *   Mixture X, an equimolar mixture of two liquids (let's call them C and D), is heated with platinum to form mixture Y.\n    *   The reaction is described as a disproportionation. In this context, it's a hydrogen transfer reaction where one species is hydrogenated and another is dehydrogenated.\n    *   The reaction is: C + D → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆).\n    *   Since X is equimolar and Y is equimolar, the stoichiometry is 1:1 → 1:1.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This confirms that both C and D must have a six-carbon skeleton, just like benzene and cyclohexane.\n    *   Let the formula for C be C₆Hₓ and for D be C₆Hᵧ.\n    *   The reaction is: C₆Hₓ + C₆Hᵧ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆.\n    *   By the law of conservation of mass, the number of hydrogen atoms must be equal on both sides of the equation.\n    *   Therefore, x + y = 12 + 6 = 18.\n\n4.  **Determine the Final Answer.**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This corresponds to the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of C (C₆Hₓ) and one molecule of D (C₆Hᵧ).\n    *   This sum is x + y.\n    *   From our analysis in step 3, we found that x + y = 18.\n\n5.  **Consistency Check.**\n    *   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, meaning components C and D must contain C=C double bonds (i.e., they are unsaturated). This is consistent with x < 12 and y < 12.\n    *   The problem states there are no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   A possible identity for mixture X could be cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n    *   In this case, x = 10 and y = 8. The sum x + y = 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   Cyclohexene has one double bond. 1,4-cyclohexadiene has two non-conjugated double bonds. Both would decolorize bromine water.\n    *   The reaction C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆ is a plausible hydrogen transfer, where cyclohexene is hydrogenated and 1,4-cyclohexadiene is dehydrogenated.\n    *   This confirms that our deduced value is consistent with the existence of such molecules.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n*   The mass fraction is given as a percentage, so 14.28% = 0.1428. This value is very close to 1/7 (1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857).\n*   Let's test the general formulas for hydrocarbons using simple integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1), as is common in such problems.\n    *   For an alkane (CnH2n+2): Mass fraction of H = (2n + 2) / (12n + 2n + 2) = (2n + 2) / (14n + 2). Setting this to 1/7 gives 7(2n + 2) = 14n + 2, which simplifies to 14n + 14 = 14n + 2, or 14 = 2, which is impossible.\n    *   For a cycloalkane (CnH2n): Mass fraction of H = (2n) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 2/14 = 1/7. This is a perfect match.\n*   So, Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n.\n*   Z is also described as being widely used as a solvent and fully saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\"). This is consistent with cycloalkanes like cyclopentane (C5H10), cyclohexane (C6H12), or methylcyclohexane (C7H14).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Composition of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water.\n*   Z is a constituent of Y. Let's call the components of Y, Y1 and Y2. So, Y1 = Z = CnH2n (a cycloalkane).\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z. This means hydrogenating Y2 must also produce Z.\n*   Y2 does not decolorize bromine water, which suggests it's saturated. However, a saturated compound typically does not react with hydrogen, unless it's a strained ring that undergoes hydrogenolysis (ring-opening). But if Y2 were a structural isomer of Z (e.g., methylcyclopentane vs. cyclohexane), hydrogenation would not convert one to the other; it would produce a different alkane.\n*   The exception for \"does not decolorize bromine water\" is an aromatic compound. Aromatic compounds like benzene (C6H6) and toluene (C7H8) do not react with bromine water under normal conditions but can be hydrogenated to their corresponding cycloalkanes under severe conditions.\n*   This leads to the hypothesis that Y2 is the aromatic analogue of Z.\n    *   Y = {CnH2n (cycloalkane Z), CnH2n-6 (aromatic compound)}.\n*   Let's check this hypothesis: Hydrogenation of CnH2n gives CnH2n. Hydrogenation of CnH2n-6 gives CnH2n. This is consistent with the fact that hydrogenating mixture Y gives only Z.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Composition of Mixture X and the Reaction**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2. They decolorize bromine water (they are unsaturated) and have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   Heating mixture X with platinum produces the equimolar mixture Y. This suggests a 1:1 reaction stoichiometry: X1 + X2 → Y1 + Y2.\n*   The reaction is a hydrogen transfer (described as a \"disproportionation\"). One component of X is reduced to the cycloalkane (Y1=Z), and the other is oxidized to the aromatic compound (Y2).\n    X1 + X2 → CnH2n + CnH2n-6\n*   Since all compounds (X1, X2, Y1, Y2) must lead to Z upon hydrogenation, they must all share the same carbon skeleton.\n*   Let's balance the hydrogen atoms in the reaction:\n    Total H in reactants = Total H in products\n    H(X1) + H(X2) = (2n) + (2n - 6) = 4n - 6.\n*   What could X1 and X2 be? They are unsaturated versions of Z. The most likely candidates are a cycloalkene (CnH2n-2) and a cyclodiene (CnH2n-4).\n    *   Let X1 = CnH2n-2 (cycloalkene).\n    *   Let X2 = CnH2n-4 (cyclodiene).\n*   The reaction becomes:\n    CnH2n-2 (X1, reduced) + 2[H] → CnH2n (Y1)\n    CnH2n-4 (X2, oxidized) → CnH2n-6 (Y2) + 2[H]\n    Overall: CnH2n-2 + CnH2n-4 → CnH2n + CnH2n-6.\n*   The hydrogen count for the proposed reactants is (2n - 2) + (2n - 4) = 4n - 6. This matches the product hydrogen count. The model is consistent.\n*   The problem states X has no conjugated bonds, so the cyclodiene (X2) must be a non-conjugated isomer (e.g., a 1,4-diene, not a 1,3-diene).\n\n**Step 4: Distinguish Between Possible Scenarios and Find the Answer**\n\n*   We have a general formula for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X: **Total H = 4n - 6**.\n*   We need to find the value of 'n'. Common cycloalkane solvents suggest n=5, 6, or 7.\n    *   If n=5 (cyclopentane), the aromatic product C5H(10-6)=C5H4 does not correspond to a stable, common liquid. This case is unlikely.\n    *   If n=6 (cyclohexane), Z=C6H12. The aromatic is benzene (C6H6). X would be cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). Total H = 4*6 - 6 = 18.\n    *   If n=7 (methylcyclohexane), Z=C7H14. The aromatic is toluene (C7H8). X would be a methylcyclohexene (C7H12) and a non-conjugated methylcyclohexadiene (C7H10). Total H = 4*7 - 6 = 22.\n\n*   Both scenarios (n=6 and n=7) are chemically plausible and lead to answers present in the options (A=22, D=18). We must find a way to distinguish them.\n*   The problem is likely constructed around the most fundamental and common textbook example of such a chemical transformation. The system involving cyclohexane, cyclohexene, cyclohexadiene, and benzene (the C6 system) is the archetypal example of catalytic hydrogen transfer reactions. The C7 system is a valid homologue, but less fundamental. In the absence of further distinguishing information, it is most probable that the question refers to the C6 system.\n\n**Step 5: Final Calculation**\n\n*   Assuming the intended scenario is n=6:\n    *   Mixture X consists of cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each of these two liquids is: 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThe reasoning is as follows:\n\n1.  **Determine the identity of hydrocarbon Z.**\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%, which is equivalent to 14.28/100 ≈ 1/7.\n    *   Let the molecular formula of the hydrocarbon be CₓHᵧ.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula: (mass of H) / (total mass) = (1.008 * y) / (12.01 * x + 1.008 * y).\n    *   Using approximate atomic masses (H=1, C=12), we get: y / (12x + y) = 1/7.\n    *   This simplifies to 7y = 12x + y, which gives 6y = 12x, or y = 2x.\n    *   The general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ. This formula can represent an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂. This fits the formula CₙH₂ₙ (with n=6) and all other descriptions. So, Z is cyclohexane.\n\n2.  **Determine the composition of mixture Y.**\n    *   Mixture Y is formed by the disproportionation of mixture X.\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water (meaning they are saturated or aromatic).\n    *   Substance Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂) is a constituent of mixture Y.\n    *   The reaction X → Y is a disproportionation on a platinum catalyst. For cyclic C₆ compounds, this is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One molecule is hydrogenated (gains H), and another is dehydrogenated (loses H).\n    *   Since one product is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), the fully hydrogenated product, the other product must be the fully dehydrogenated C₆ ring, which is benzene (C₆H₆).\n    *   Benzene is aromatic and does not decolorize bromine water.\n    *   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆).\n\n3.  **Relate mixture X to mixture Y.**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (let's call them A and B) that undergoes disproportionation to form mixture Y.\n    *   The reaction is: A + B → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆.\n    *   By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms on the reactant side must equal the total number of atoms on the product side.\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B.\n\n4.  **Calculate the total number of hydrogen atoms.**\n    *   Total H atoms in reactants (A + B) = Total H atoms in products (cyclohexane + benzene).\n    *   Total H atoms = (Number of H in C₆H₁₂) + (Number of H in C₆H₆).\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Hydrocarbon Z**\n    *   The problem states that hydrocarbon Z has a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   Let the molecular formula of Z be CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula: `(y * AtomicMass(H)) / (x * AtomicMass(C) + y * AtomicMass(H))`.\n    *   Using atomic masses C ≈ 12 and H ≈ 1, we get: `y / (12x + y) = 0.1428`.\n    *   The value 14.28% is very close to 1/7. Let's test this: `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`.\n    *   This gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n    *   So, the empirical formula of Z is CH2, and its molecular formula is CnH2n.\n    *   The problem also states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a saturated hydrocarbon. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Z is a constituent of mixture Y. So, one component of Y is the cycloalkane Z (CnH2n).\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only Z. Let the other component of Y be Y'.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Z (CnH2n) gives Z itself, as it's already saturated.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y' must also yield Z (CnH2n). For this to happen, Y' must have the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n    *   If Y' were another saturated compound (like an isomer of Z), hydrogenation would not convert it to Z (it might cause ring-opening to an acyclic alkane, but that would result in a different product).\n    *   The most plausible candidate for Y' is an aromatic hydrocarbon. Aromatic hydrocarbons do not decolorize bromine water and can be hydrogenated to the corresponding cycloalkane.\n    *   A monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with n carbon atoms has the general formula CnH(2n-6) (e.g., benzene C6H6, toluene C7H8).\n    *   So, mixture Y consists of Z (CnH2n) and an aromatic hydrocarbon (CnH(2n-6)). Hydrogenating this mixture would convert the aromatic part to CnH2n, resulting in a single product, Z. This fits all the conditions.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Disproportionation Reaction**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2. They decolorize bromine water, so they are unsaturated (contain C=C bonds). They have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   The conversion of X to Y is a disproportionation reaction upon heating with a platinum catalyst. This is characteristic of a catalytic hydrogen transfer reaction.\n    *   The reaction is: `X1 + X2 -> Y1 + Y2`. Since the starting mixture X and product mixture Y are both equimolar, this is a 1:1 reaction.\n    *   Substituting the formulas for the components of Y: `X1 + X2 -> CnH2n + CnH(2n-6)`.\n    *   By conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in X1 and X2 must equal the total in Y1 and Y2. Let X1 be CnHx and X2 be CnH(y). Then `x + y = (2n) + (2n-6) = 4n - 6`.\n    *   Hydrogenation of both X1 and X2 gives only Z (CnH2n). This means X1 and X2 are unsaturated hydrocarbons with the same n-carbon skeleton as Z.\n    *   The most logical candidates for X1 and X2 are the corresponding cycloalkene (CnH(2n-2)) and a non-conjugated cycloalkadiene (CnH(2n-4)).\n    *   Let's check if these fit the hydrogen balance: `(2n-2) + (2n-4) = 4n - 6`. This matches perfectly.\n    *   The reaction is a hydrogen transfer: the cycloalkadiene (CnH(2n-4)) loses 2 hydrogen atoms to become the aromatic compound (CnH(2n-6)), and the cycloalkene (CnH(2n-2)) gains these 2 hydrogen atoms to become the cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n\n4.  **Determine the Value of 'n' and the Final Answer**\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is the sum of hydrogens in CnH(2n-2) and CnH(2n-4), which is `4n - 6`.\n    *   Now we need to find 'n'. The problem states Z is a \"widely used solvent\". Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclohexane (n=6) and methylcyclohexane (n=7).\n    *   Let's test the possible answers, which represent the total number of hydrogen atoms (4n-6):\n        *   If Total H = 18 (Option A): `18 = 4n - 6` => `4n = 24` => `n = 6`. This corresponds to Z being cyclohexane. The components of X would be cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). The sum of H atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. This is a valid solution.\n        *   If Total H = 22 (Option C): `22 = 4n - 6` => `4n = 28` => `n = 7`. This corresponds to Z being methylcyclohexane. The components of X would be a methylcyclohexene (C7H12) and a non-conjugated methylcyclohexadiene (C7H10). The sum of H atoms is 12 + 10 = 22. This is also a chemically plausible solution.\n        *   The other options, 12 and 16, do not yield integer values for 'n'.\n    *   We have two plausible scenarios (n=6 and n=7). However, the set of reactions described (hydrogen transfer between a diene and an alkene to yield an aromatic and an alkane) is a classic textbook example in organic chemistry, almost always illustrated with the C6 system (cyclohexane/benzene). Given the context of such a problem, the most fundamental and common example is the intended answer.\n    *   Therefore, we conclude that n=6.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n    *   The system is based on C6 hydrocarbons.\n    *   Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    *   Y = {Cyclohexane (C6H12), Benzene (C6H6)}.\n    *   X = {Cyclohexene (C6H10), 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)}.\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is the sum of hydrogens in one molecule of cyclohexene and one molecule of 1,4-cyclohexadiene.\n    *   Total H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the chemistry problem.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon, let's denote its formula as CxHy.\n*   It is saturated because it does not react further with hydrogen.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given as 14.28%. This value is very close to 1/7 (100/7 ≈ 14.2857%). In chemistry problems, this often suggests using integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1) for calculation.\n*   Let's verify this. The mass percentage of hydrogen in a hydrocarbon CnHm is (m * 1) / (12n + m). If the formula is of the type CnH2n (cycloalkanes or alkenes), the percentage of H is (2n) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%.\n*   Since Z is saturated, it cannot be an alkene. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane with the general formula CnH2n.\n*   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclopentane (C5H10), cyclohexane (C6H12), and methylcyclohexane (C7H14). All fit the CnH2n formula.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, Z and another compound D.\n*   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water. Since Z (a cycloalkane) does not react with bromine water, D must also not react.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z. This means that the hydrogenation of D must yield Z.\n*   This implies that D has the same carbon skeleton as Z and is unsaturated. For D to not decolorize bromine water, it must be an aromatic compound. Standard aromatic compounds like benzene and toluene do not react with bromine water without a catalyst.\n*   Let's check our potential candidates for Z:\n    *   If Z = Cyclopentane (C5H10), D would need to be a stable C5 aromatic hydrocarbon. None exist (cyclopentadienyl anion is aromatic, but not a neutral hydrocarbon). So, n=5 is ruled out.\n    *   If Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12), D would be Benzene (C6H6). Benzene does not decolorize bromine water and hydrogenates to cyclohexane under severe conditions. This is a valid case.\n    *   If Z = Methylcyclohexane (C7H14), D would be Toluene (C7H8). Toluene does not decolorize bromine water and hydrogenates to methylcyclohexane. This is also a valid case.\n    *   If Z = Cyclooctane (C8H16), D would be Cyclooctatetraene (C8H8). Cyclooctatetraene is not aromatic in the same way as benzene and behaves like a polyene, readily decolorizing bromine water. Thus, n=8 is ruled out.\n*   So, the problem is narrowed down to two possibilities: the C6 system or the C7 system.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Components of Mixture X and the Reaction**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B.\n*   X decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and B are unsaturated (containing C=C or C≡C bonds).\n*   Hydrogenation of X gives only Z. This means both A and B must have the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n*   The molecules in X have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   The reaction from X to Y is a disproportionation that occurs on heated platinum. In this context, it refers to a catalytic hydrogen transfer. The most plausible scenario that results in an equimolar mixture Y from an equimolar mixture X is a specific combination of reactants undergoing Zelinsky disproportionation.\n*   Let's analyze the general stoichiometry of this reaction for a cycloalkene CnH(2n-2) (one double bond, k=1) and a cycloalkadiene CnH(2n-4) (two double bonds, k=2), which both yield a cycloalkane CnH2n (Z) and an aromatic compound CnH(2n-6) (D).\n    *   For a cycloalkene (k=1): 3 CnH(2n-2) → 2 CnH2n + 1 CnH(2n-6)\n    *   For a cycloalkadiene (k=2): 3 CnH(2n-4) → 1 CnH2n + 2 CnH(2n-6)\n*   If we start with an equimolar mixture of A (the cycloalkene) and B (the cycloalkadiene), say 3 moles of each, the total products will be:\n    *   From A: 2 moles of Z + 1 mole of D\n    *   From B: 1 mole of Z + 2 moles of D\n    *   Total: (2+1) = 3 moles of Z and (1+2) = 3 moles of D.\n*   This combination produces an equimolar mixture of Z and D, perfectly matching the problem description.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the C6 and C7 Cases and Find the Solution**\n\n*   **Case 1: The C6 System**\n    *   Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12)\n    *   D = Benzene (C6H6)\n    *   A = Cyclohexene (C6H10)\n    *   B = A non-conjugated cyclohexadiene. The only one is Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8).\n    *   This system fits all conditions. The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n*   **Case 2: The C7 System**\n    *   Z = Methylcyclohexane (C7H14)\n    *   D = Toluene (C7H8)\n    *   A = A methylcyclohexene (C7H12).\n    *   B = A non-conjugated methylcyclohexadiene (e.g., 1-methylcyclohexa-2,5-diene, C7H10).\n    *   This system also fits all conditions. The total number of hydrogen atoms would be 12 + 10 = 22.\n\n*   **Distinguishing Between C6 and C7**\n    *   Both cases are chemically plausible and consistent with all the statements. However, chemistry problems of this type usually have a unique solution. The C6 system (cyclohexane/benzene) is the parent, unsubstituted, and most classic textbook example of Zelinsky disproportionation. In the absence of further information, it is the most reasonable interpretation of \"a certain hydrocarbon Z\". The problem is likely designed around this fundamental example.\n\n**Step 5: Final Calculation**\n\nBased on the conclusion that the C6 system is the intended subject of the problem:\n*   Liquid A is Cyclohexene (C6H10).\n*   Liquid B is Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8).\n*   The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X (one molecule of each) is the sum of hydrogen atoms in A and B.\n*   Total H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z.**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is `(y * 1) / (x * 12 + y * 1)`.\n    *   14.28% is very close to 1/7. So, `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`.\n    *   This gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n    *   The general formula for Z is CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states that Z is formed by hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen. A CnH2n formula can represent an alkene or a cycloalkane. Since it's saturated (doesn't react with H2), it must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Z is also described as a liquid widely used as a solvent. The most common cycloalkane that fits this description is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n    *   Let's check the mass fraction for cyclohexane: H% = (12 * 1.008) / (6 * 12.011 + 12 * 1.008) = 12.096 / (72.066 + 12.096) = 12.096 / 84.162 ≈ 0.1437, which is consistent with the given 14.28%. Using integer masses: 12 / (6*12 + 12) = 12/84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%.\n    *   So, **Z is cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n2.  **Identify the components of Mixture Y.**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated.\n    *   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of Y. Let's call the components Y1 and Y2. So, Y1 = cyclohexane.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   This means hydrogenation of Y1 gives cyclohexane (which is true, as it's already cyclohexane).\n    *   And hydrogenation of Y2 gives cyclohexane. Since Y2 is saturated, this reaction must be an isomerization under severe hydrogenation conditions (e.g., high temperature and pressure with a Pt catalyst).\n    *   Y2 must be a saturated C6H12 isomer of cyclohexane. The most common and stable liquid isomer is **methylcyclopentane (C6H12)**. Isomerization of methylcyclopentane to cyclohexane is a known industrial process.\n    *   Therefore, **Mixture Y = {cyclohexane, methylcyclopentane}**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the reaction from X to Y.**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two unsaturated liquids, let's call them C and D. X has no conjugated bonds.\n    *   The reaction X → Y is a disproportionation on a heated platinum catalyst.\n    *   A disproportionation of cyclic unsaturated hydrocarbons over platinum typically involves hydrogen transfer, yielding a more saturated (reduced) species and a more unsaturated (oxidized) species.\n    *   The products in mixture Y (cyclohexane, methylcyclopentane) are fully saturated. This implies they are the reduced products. The oxidized product is not mentioned as part of Y, so it must be a co-product. For C6 cyclic systems, the ultimate oxidation product is benzene (C6H6).\n    *   The overall process can be described as: Mixture X → Mixture Y + Benzene.\n    *   `Mixture {C, D} --(Pt, heat)--> Mixture {cyclohexane, methylcyclopentane} + Benzene`\n\n4.  **Identify the components of Mixture X.**\n    *   The components of X, C and D, must be the precursors to the components of Y.\n    *   Hydrogenation of X gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n        *   H2 + C → cyclohexane. This means C must be an unsaturated C6 hydrocarbon with a six-membered ring skeleton (e.g., cyclohexene or cyclohexadiene).\n        *   H2 + D → cyclohexane. This means D must be an unsaturated C6 hydrocarbon whose skeleton can be hydrogenated and rearranged to a six-membered ring. The most logical precursor for methylcyclopentane (from Y) that also ultimately yields cyclohexane is an unsaturated version of methylcyclopentane (e.g., methylcyclopentene or methylcyclopentadiene).\n    *   Let C = C6Hy and D = C6Hq.\n    *   The reaction consumes C and D in a 1:1 molar ratio (since X is equimolar) and produces cyclohexane and methylcyclopentane in a 1:1 molar ratio (since Y is equimolar).\n    *   Let's write a general balanced equation for the reaction. Let `a` be the coefficient for C and D, `p` for the products in Y, and `r` for benzene.\n        `a C + a D → p cyclohexane + p methylcyclopentane + r benzene`\n    *   Substituting the formulas:\n        `a C6Hy + a C6Hq → p C6H12 + p C6H12 + r C6H6`\n    *   Balancing the carbon atoms:\n        `6a + 6a = 6p + 6p + 6r`\n        `12a = 12p + 6r`\n        `2a = 2p + r` (Equation 1)\n    *   Balancing the hydrogen atoms:\n        `a*y + a*q = 12p + 12p + 6r`\n        `a(y + q) = 24p + 6r` (Equation 2)\n    *   Now we must determine `y` and `q`. C must be cyclohexene (C6H10) or a cyclohexadiene (C6H8). The problem states no conjugated bonds, so 1,3-cyclohexadiene is out, but **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)** is a possibility. D must be an unsaturated version of methylcyclopentane, like **methylcyclopentene (C6H10)**.\n    *   Let's test the hypothesis: **C = 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)** and **D = methylcyclopentene (C6H10)**.\n    *   So, `y = 8` and `q = 10`.\n    *   Substitute `y` and `q` into Equation 2:\n        `a(8 + 10) = 24p + 6r`\n        `18a = 24p + 6r`\n        `3a = 4p + r` (Equation 2, simplified)\n    *   Now we solve the system of two equations:\n        1) `2a = 2p + r`\n        2) `3a = 4p + r`\n    *   From (1), `r = 2a - 2p`. Substitute this into (2):\n        `3a = 4p + (2a - 2p)`\n        `3a = 2p + 2a`\n        `a = 2p`\n    *   This gives a simple integer ratio for the coefficients `a` and `p`. If we choose `p=1`, then `a=2`.\n    *   The reaction stoichiometry is: `2 C6H8 + 2 C6H10 → 1 C6H12 + 1 C6H12 + r C6H6`. The 2:2 ratio for reactants confirms they can be an equimolar mixture. The 1:1 ratio for products confirms Y is an equimolar mixture. This model is consistent.\n    *   The two liquids in mixture X are 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) and methylcyclopentene (C6H10).\n\n5.  **Calculate the final answer.**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n    *   Number of H atoms in 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) = 8.\n    *   Number of H atoms in methylcyclopentene (C6H10) = 10.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 8 + 10 = 18.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon, so its formula is CxHy.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is given as 14.28%, which is equivalent to 0.1428.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen can be expressed as: Mass Fraction (H) = (y * Ar(H)) / (x * Ar(C) + y * Ar(H)), where Ar(H) ≈ 1 and Ar(C) ≈ 12.\n*   So, 0.1428 ≈ y / (12x + y).\n*   Rearranging this gives: 1 / 0.1428 ≈ (12x + y) / y => 7.00 ≈ 12x/y + 1 => 6 ≈ 12x/y => y/x ≈ 2.\n*   This suggests an empirical formula of CH2.\n*   The general formula for a hydrocarbon with a y/x ratio of 2 is CnH2n.\n*   The problem states that Z is formed by hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a saturated hydrocarbon.\n*   Saturated hydrocarbons are alkanes (CnH2n+2) or cycloalkanes (CnH2n).\n*   The formula CnH2n corresponds to a cycloalkane. The mass fraction of hydrogen in any cycloalkane is (2n * 1) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857, which matches the given value perfectly.\n*   So, Z is a cycloalkane. The problem also states that Z is widely used as a solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane (C6H12). Let's assume Z is cyclohexane. This is consistent with all the information.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water.\n*   Mixture Y is formed by the disproportionation of mixture X. A disproportionation reaction in this context involves hydrogen transfer, where some molecules are hydrogenated (gain H) and others are dehydrogenated (lose H).\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane, C6H12).\n*   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of mixture Y. So, one component of Y is cyclohexane (C6H12).\n*   Let the other component of Y be Y2. Hydrogenation of Y2 must also give cyclohexane. This means Y2 must have a C6 ring skeleton.\n*   Since Y is the product of disproportionation, and one product (cyclohexane) is the fully hydrogenated C6 ring, the other product (Y2) must be the dehydrogenated C6 ring. The ultimate dehydrogenated C6 ring is benzene (C6H6).\n*   Let's check if Y = {cyclohexane (C6H12), benzene (C6H6)} fits the description.\n    *   **Equimolar mixture of two liquids:** Yes, both are liquids at room temperature.\n    *   **Does not decolorize bromine water:** Correct. Cyclohexane is saturated. Benzene's aromatic ring is stable and does not react with bromine water in an addition reaction.\n    *   **Hydrogenation gives only Z:** Correct. Hydrogenation of benzene yields cyclohexane. Hydrogenation of cyclohexane yields itself. So the only product is cyclohexane (Z).\n*   Therefore, mixture Y consists of cyclohexane and benzene.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms in Mixture X**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2.\n*   Mixture X undergoes a disproportionation reaction upon heating with platinum to form the equimolar mixture Y.\n*   The reaction can be written as: X1 + X2 → Y1 + Y2\n*   Substituting the components of Y, we get: X1 + X2 → Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6).\n*   Since the hydrogenation of mixture X also gives only cyclohexane, the components X1 and X2 must also be C6 compounds with a six-membered ring skeleton. Let their formulas be C6Hn and C6Hm.\n*   The reaction is: C6Hn + C6Hm → C6H12 + C6H6.\n*   According to the law of conservation of mass, the number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the reaction. Let's balance the hydrogen atoms:\n    *   Total H atoms on the left = n + m\n    *   Total H atoms on the right = 12 + 6 = 18\n*   Therefore, n + m = 18.\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is the sum of the hydrogen atoms in one molecule of X1 and one molecule of X2, which is n + m.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18. This corresponds to option C.\n\n*(For completeness, a plausible identity for mixture X would be cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). Neither has conjugated bonds. The total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. The disproportionation reaction C6H10 + C6H8 → C6H12 + C6H6 is balanced and chemically reasonable.)*\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z.**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let its formula be CxHy.\n    *   The mass fraction of H is `(y * AtomicMass(H)) / (x * AtomicMass(C) + y * AtomicMass(H))`.\n    *   Using integer atomic masses (H=1, C=12), the mass fraction is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   14.28% is approximately 0.142857, which is equal to 1/7.\n    *   So, `y / (12x + y) = 1/7` => `7y = 12x + y` => `6y = 12x` => `y = 2x`.\n    *   The empirical formula of Z is CH2, and its molecular formula is CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a saturated compound. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclohexane (C6H12), methylcyclohexane (C7H14), etc. Both fit the CnH2n formula.\n\n2.  **Identify the Carbon Skeleton.**\n    *   Mixture X (containing two liquids, A and B) and mixture Y (containing two liquids, C and D) can both be hydrogenated under severe conditions to produce *only* substance Z.\n    *   This is a crucial piece of information. It means that all four compounds (A, B, C, D) and Z share the same carbon skeleton. For example, if Z is cyclohexane, then A, B, C, and D must all be compounds with a six-membered carbon ring.\n\n3.  **Identify Mixture Y.**\n    *   Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This indicates that its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Z is a constituent of mixture Y. So, one component of Y is the cycloalkane Z.\n    *   The other component of Y must also have the same carbon skeleton and be saturated or aromatic. For its hydrogenation to also yield Z, it must be an aromatic compound corresponding to Z.\n    *   Let's assume the simplest case for the carbon skeleton, a 6-membered ring. This makes Z **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n    *   The corresponding aromatic compound is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions. Hydrogenation of benzene (C6H6 + 3H2) yields cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    *   So, Mixture Y = {**Benzene (C6H6)**, **Cyclohexane (C6H12)**}. This fits all the descriptions for Y.\n\n4.  **Identify Mixture X and the Reaction.**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B, which decolorizes bromine water (so they are unsaturated) and has no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   X is converted to Y upon heating with a platinum catalyst. The reaction is described as a disproportionation.\n    *   Since an equimolar mixture X yields an equimolar mixture Y, the reaction is most likely an intermolecular hydrogen transfer with 1:1 stoichiometry: A + B → C + D.\n    *   In our case: A + B → Benzene (C6H6) + Cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    *   This is a redox reaction where one molecule is oxidized (loses hydrogen) to form benzene, and the other is reduced (gains hydrogen) to form cyclohexane.\n        *   Oxidation: A → C6H6\n        *   Reduction: B → C6H12\n    *   A and B must be unsaturated C6 ring compounds. Possible candidates are cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexadienes (C6H8).\n    *   The total number of atoms must balance: Formula(A) + Formula(B) = C6H6 + C6H12 = C12H18.\n    *   If we choose A = **cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)** and B = **cyclohexene (C6H10)**, the sum is C12H18.\n    *   Let's check the hydrogen transfer:\n        *   C6H8 → C6H6 + 2H (loses 2 hydrogen atoms)\n        *   C6H10 + 2H → C6H12 (gains 2 hydrogen atoms)\n        *   The hydrogen transfer is balanced.\n    *   Let's check the final conditions for X:\n        *   Are they liquids? Yes (BP of cyclohexene is 83°C, cyclohexa-1,4-diene is 26°C).\n        *   Do they decolorize bromine water? Yes, both have double bonds.\n        *   Are there conjugated multiple bonds? Cyclohexene has one double bond. Cyclohexa-1,4-diene has two double bonds separated by two single bonds, so they are not conjugated. This condition is satisfied.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer.**\n    *   Mixture X consists of two liquids: Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8) and Cyclohexene (C6H10).\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   Number of H atoms in one molecule of C6H8 = 8.\n    *   Number of H atoms in one molecule of C6H10 = 10.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 8 + 10 = 18.\n\nThis solution is consistent with all the facts presented in the problem. The C7 case (involving toluene and methylcyclohexane) also appears consistent, leading to an answer of 22. However, the C6 case represents the simplest and most fundamental chemical system that fits the description, and it is common for such problems to refer to the parent system unless specified otherwise.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms is 18.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance Z**\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula: `mass % H = (mass of H in molecule) / (total molar mass of molecule)`.\n*   Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CnHm. The molar mass is approximately `12n + m`. The mass of hydrogen is `m`.\n*   So, `m / (12n + m) ≈ 0.1428`.\n*   The fraction 1/7 is equal to `0.142857...`, which is a very close match.\n*   Let's test this: `m / (12n + m) = 1/7`\n    *   `7m = 12n + m`\n    *   `6m = 12n`\n    *   `m = 2n`\n*   So, the general formula for substance Z is CnH2n. This formula corresponds to either an alkene (with one double bond) or a cycloalkane.\n*   The problem states that Z is formed by hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z must be a saturated compound. Therefore, Z cannot be an alkene and must be a cycloalkane.\n*   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. Let's check if n=6 fits. If n=6, m=2*6=12. The formula is C6H12. This is cyclohexane.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Carbon Skeleton of All Compounds**\n*   The problem states that hydrogenation of *both* mixture X and mixture Y under severe conditions gives *only* substance Z (cyclohexane, C6H12).\n*   This is a crucial piece of information. It means that all components in both mixtures X and Y are based on a six-carbon ring skeleton. Any other skeleton (like methylcyclopentane or linear hexanes) would not hydrogenate to cyclohexane.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n*   One of the components is substance Z, which we identified as **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n*   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated or aromatic. Cyclohexane is saturated.\n*   Mixture Y is formed from mixture X by a \"disproportionation\" reaction on a platinum catalyst when heated. Platinum is a classic catalyst for hydrogenation and dehydrogenation. Disproportionation in this context refers to a hydrogen transfer reaction where some molecules are hydrogenated and others are dehydrogenated.\n*   Since one component of Y is cyclohexane (the fully hydrogenated C6 ring), the other component must be the product of dehydrogenation. The ultimate, stable product of dehydrogenating a C6 ring is **benzene (C6H6)**.\n*   Let's check if benzene fits the description. It is a liquid. It is aromatic and does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions. It has a C6 ring skeleton.\n*   Therefore, Mixture Y consists of equimolar amounts of **benzene (C6H6)** and **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Reaction and Identify Components of Mixture X**\n*   The reaction is the conversion of mixture X to mixture Y.\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of benzene (C) and cyclohexane (D).\n*   Since the starting mixture (X) and the final mixture (Y) are both equimolar, the reaction stoichiometry must be 1:1 -> 1:1.\n    *   `A + B --(Pt, heat)--> C + D`\n    *   `A + B --> C6H6 + C6H12`\n*   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component of X (e.g., A) is dehydrogenated to form benzene, while the other component (B) is hydrogenated to form cyclohexane.\n*   The law of conservation of mass must apply. Specifically, the total number of hydrogen atoms on the left side of the equation must equal the total number on the right side.\n*   Number of H atoms in products = (H atoms in one molecule of benzene) + (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane)\n    *   = 6 + 12\n    *   = 18\n*   Therefore, the number of H atoms in the reactants must also be 18.\n*   Number of H atoms in reactants = (H atoms in one molecule of A) + (H atoms in one molecule of B) = 18.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of the number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each of the two liquids.\n*   Based on our analysis, this sum is 18.\n\n*For completeness, let's propose the identities of A and B:*\n*   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, so A and B must be unsaturated (contain C=C bonds).\n*   They must have a C6 ring skeleton.\n*   They must not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   Their total hydrogen count must be 18.\n*   A plausible pair is **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n    *   Sum of H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   Both are alkenes and will decolorize bromine water.\n    *   1,4-cyclohexadiene is non-conjugated (unlike its 1,3-isomer).\n    *   In the reaction, the diene (C6H8) can be dehydrogenated to benzene (C6H6), releasing 2 H atoms. The alkene (C6H10) can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane (C6H12), consuming 2 H atoms. The hydrogen transfer is balanced. This is a consistent solution.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon that is fully saturated (does not react further with hydrogen). This means it is an alkane (CnH2n+2) or a cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. Let's determine the formula of Z.\n    *   The mass fraction of Hydrogen (H) in a hydrocarbon (CxHy) is given by:\n        Mass % H = (y * AtomicMass(H)) / (x * AtomicMass(C) + y * AtomicMass(H)) * 100%\n    *   Using approximate atomic masses (C=12, H=1):\n        For an alkane (CnH2n+2): Mass % H = (2n+2) / (12n + 2n+2) = (2n+2) / (14n+2). As n gets larger, this approaches 2/14 = 1/7 ≈ 14.3%.\n        For a cycloalkane (CnH2n): Mass % H = (2n) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 14.2857%.\n    *   The value 14.28% is an excellent match for 1/7, which corresponds to the general formula CnH2n. Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z is widely used as a solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. Let's assume Z is cyclohexane.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, C and D.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y gives only substance Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   Z (cyclohexane) is itself a component of Y. Let's say C = Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    *   Since hydrogenation of Y gives only cyclohexane, the other component, D, must also hydrogenate to cyclohexane. This means D must have a 6-carbon ring skeleton.\n    *   Since D does not decolorize bromine water, it must be saturated or aromatic. It cannot be cyclohexane (since C and D are different). The only remaining possibility for a C6-ring structure is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene does not react with bromine water and is hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n    *   So, **Mixture Y = Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)**. This fits all the conditions.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Reaction**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B.\n    *   X is converted to Y by treatment with platinum when heated in a disproportionation reaction. Disproportionation here implies a hydrogen transfer reaction.\n        `A + B --(Pt, heat)--> C + D`\n        `A + B --(Pt, heat)--> Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)`\n    *   This is a hydrogen transfer: one reactant is oxidized (loses H) to form benzene, and the other is reduced (gains H) to form cyclohexane.\n    *   By conservation of atoms, the total number of carbon and hydrogen atoms must be the same on both sides of the reaction.\n        Total atoms in products = (C6H12 + C6H6) = C12H18.\n        Therefore, total atoms in reactants = A + B = C12H18.\n    *   The problem states that hydrogenation of mixture X (A and B) gives *only* one substance, Z (cyclohexane). This implies that both A and B have the same carbon skeleton: a 6-carbon ring.\n    *   So, A must be C6Hx and B must be C6Hy.\n    *   From the atom balance, we have x + y = 18.\n\n4.  **Identify Liquids in Mixture X**\n    *   We need to find two different C6-ring molecules, A and B, where the sum of their hydrogen atoms is 18.\n    *   The reaction is: `C6Hx + C6Hy -> C6H12 + C6H6`.\n        One molecule is oxidized to benzene (C6H6), and the other is reduced to cyclohexane (C6H12). For example:\n        `C6Hx -> C6H6 + (x-6)H` (oxidation)\n        `C6Hy + (12-y)H -> C6H12` (reduction)\n        For the hydrogen transfer to balance, `x-6 = 12-y`, which simplifies to `x+y = 18`. This confirms our previous finding.\n    *   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, meaning both A and B must be unsaturated (contain C=C bonds).\n    *   The problem also states there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of mixture X.\n    *   Let's consider possible unsaturated C6-ring structures:\n        *   Cyclohexene (C6H10)\n        *   Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)\n    *   Let's try the combination: A = C6H10 and B = C6H8. The sum of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. This works.\n    *   Let's check the structures and conditions:\n        *   A = **Cyclohexene (C6H10)**. It has one double bond, so it is unsaturated and has no conjugated bonds.\n        *   B = **Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**. There are two isomers: cyclohexa-1,3-diene (conjugated) and cyclohexa-1,4-diene (non-conjugated). The problem specifies no conjugated bonds, so B must be **cyclohexa-1,4-diene**.\n    *   This pair of molecules, cyclohexene and cyclohexa-1,4-diene, fits all the conditions described for mixture X.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of liquid A and one molecule of liquid B.\n    *   Liquid A = Cyclohexene (C6H10). Number of H atoms = 10.\n    *   Liquid B = Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8). Number of H atoms = 8.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon, a product of hydrogenation, and does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (an alkane or a cycloalkane).\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. Let's determine the empirical formula.\n    *   14.28% is very close to 14.2857%, which is the fraction 1/7.\n    *   Mass % of H = (mass of H) / (total mass) = 1/7.\n    *   This implies (mass of H) / (mass of C) = 1/6.\n    *   Let the formula be CxHy. Using atomic masses C≈12 and H≈1, we get (y * 1) / (x * 12) = 1/6.\n    *   This simplifies to 6y = 12x, or y = 2x.\n    *   The formula for Z is (CH2)n, or CnH2n. This is the general formula for a cycloalkane. Since Z is a saturated hydrocarbon, it must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclopentane (C5H10) and cyclohexane (C6H12). Both fit the CnH2n formula.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, C and D.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are either saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z (CnH2n).\n    *   Z is a constituent of mixture Y. Let's say C = Z = CnH2n (the cycloalkane).\n    *   The other component, D, must also hydrogenate to Z. Since D does not decolorize bromine water, it must be an aromatic compound with the same carbon skeleton. The most common and stable aromatic compounds are based on a benzene ring (n=6).\n    *   Let's hypothesize that n=6. Then Z is cyclohexane (C6H12). The corresponding aromatic compound D would be benzene (C6H6).\n    *   Let's check if this fits: Y = {cyclohexane (C6H12), benzene (C6H6)}.\n        *   Cyclohexane is saturated. Benzene only reacts with Br2 in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst, not with bromine water. So, Y does not decolorize bromine water. (This fits).\n        *   Hydrogenation of Y: Cyclohexane doesn't react. Benzene hydrogenates to cyclohexane (C6H6 + 3H2 -> C6H12). So, hydrogenation gives only one substance, Z=cyclohexane. (This fits).\n        *   The n=6 hypothesis seems very strong.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Reaction**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B.\n    *   X decolorizes bromine water, so A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n    *   Hydrogenation of X gives only Z (cyclohexane, C6H12). This means both A and B must have a six-carbon ring skeleton.\n    *   Molecules in X have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   The reaction is a disproportionation: X -> Y. Since X and Y are equimolar mixtures, the reaction is likely A + B -> C + D.\n    *   Substituting the identities of C and D (from our n=6 hypothesis): A + B -> C6H12 + C6H6.\n    *   This reaction represents a transfer of hydrogen atoms. By the law of conservation of mass, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants must equal the total in the products.\n    *   Total H atoms in products = (H in C6H12) + (H in C6H6) = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   Therefore, the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B must be 18. H(A) + H(B) = 18.\n\n4.  **Identify Substances A and B**\n    *   We need to find two compounds, A and B, that satisfy these conditions:\n        *   Have a 6-carbon ring skeleton.\n        *   Are unsaturated.\n        *   Are not conjugated.\n        *   H(A) + H(B) = 18.\n    *   The possible non-conjugated unsaturated C6-ring compounds are:\n        *   Cyclohexene: C6H10\n        *   1,4-Cyclohexadiene: C6H8\n        *   (1,3-Cyclohexadiene is conjugated, so it's ruled out).\n    *   Let's check the sum of hydrogens for this pair:\n        *   H(cyclohexene) + H(1,4-cyclohexadiene) = 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   This combination perfectly fits the hydrogen requirement. So, mixture X consists of cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene.\n    *   The disproportionation reaction is:\n        C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)\n        In this reaction, cyclohexene is reduced (gains 2H) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene is oxidized (loses 2H). This is a plausible catalytic hydrogen transfer.\n\n5.  **Answer the Question**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   The two liquids are cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms is the sum of hydrogens in one molecule of each component.\n    *   Total H = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   Let's test the general formulas for hydrocarbons.\n        *   Alkanes (CnH2n+2): Mass % H = (2n+2) / (12n + 2n+2) = (2n+2) / (14n+2). If n is large, this approaches 2/14 ≈ 14.3%. Let's check the given value: 14.28% is very close to 1/7.\n            (2n+2) / (14n+2) = 1/7 => 14n + 14 = 14n + 2 => 14 = 2, which is impossible.\n        *   Cycloalkanes (CnH2n): Mass % H = (2n) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 2/14 = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857. This is a perfect match for 14.28%.\n    *   So, Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states Z is widely used as a solvent and is formed from the hydrogenation of all other compounds in mixtures X and Y. This implies a stable, common structure. The most common cycloalkane solvents are cyclopentane (C5H10) and cyclohexane (C6H12). Both fit the CnH2n formula.\n    *   The problem also states Z does not react further with hydrogen, confirming it is a saturated compound (a cycloalkane).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction and Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture X (unsaturated) undergoes disproportionation on a heated platinum catalyst to form mixture Y (saturated/unreactive to Br2 water).\n    *   Disproportionation is a redox reaction where a substance is simultaneously oxidized and reduced. In this context, it will be a hydrogen transfer reaction. One molecule will gain hydrogen (reduction) and another will lose hydrogen (oxidation).\n    *   Mixture Y contains Z as one of its components. Let's assume Z is cyclohexane (C6H12), a very common solvent. This implies the carbon skeleton for all compounds is a six-membered ring.\n    *   So, one component of Y is cyclohexane (C6H12). Let's call it C. C = C6H12.\n    *   The other component of Y, let's call it D, must also be formed in the disproportionation. It does not decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenation of D must also yield Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   The most plausible \"oxidized\" product from a C6 ring that is stable and does not react with bromine water is benzene (C6H6). Aromatic compounds are unreactive towards Br2 water under standard test conditions. Severe hydrogenation of benzene does indeed produce cyclohexane.\n    *   So, we hypothesize that Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6).\n        *   C = Cyclohexane (C6H12)\n        *   D = Benzene (C6H6)\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Disproportionation Reaction**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B. The reaction is:\n        A + B --(Pt, heat)--> C + D\n    *   Substituting our identified components of Y:\n        A + B --(Pt, heat)--> Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)\n    *   This is an equimolar reaction producing an equimolar mixture, as stated.\n    *   Let's balance the atoms. All compounds have a C6 skeleton.\n        C6Hx + C6Hy -> C6H12 + C6H6\n    *   Balancing the hydrogen atoms: x + y = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   Now we need to identify A and B from the properties of mixture X.\n        *   They are unsaturated (decolorize Br2 water). This means x < 12 and y < 12.\n        *   They do not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n        *   They must hydrogenate to cyclohexane, so they must have a C6 ring skeleton.\n    *   Let's find C6-ring molecules that fit these descriptions and the hydrogen balance (x + y = 18).\n        *   A plausible candidate for A is **cyclohexene (C6H10)**. It has one double bond, is non-conjugated, and its formula is C6H10 (so x=10).\n        *   If x=10, then y must be 18 - 10 = 8. We need to find a non-conjugated C6-ring compound with the formula C6H8.\n        *   A plausible candidate for B is **cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)**. It has two double bonds separated by CH2 groups, so they are not conjugated. Its formula is C6H8 (so y=8). Cyclohexa-1,3-diene is ruled out because it is conjugated.\n    *   So, let's propose:\n        *   Mixture X = {Cyclohexene (C6H10), Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)}\n\n4.  **Final Verification**\n    *   **Mixture X**: An equimolar mixture of cyclohexene and cyclohexa-1,4-diene. Both are liquids, contain double bonds (decolorize Br2 water), and are non-conjugated. This fits.\n    *   **Reaction**: Cyclohexene (C6H10) + Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8) -> Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6). This is a valid hydrogen transfer (disproportionation). The diene (C6H8) is oxidized to benzene (C6H6), and the ene (C6H10) is reduced to the ane (C6H12).\n    *   **Mixture Y**: An equimolar mixture of cyclohexane and benzene. Both are liquids. Cyclohexane is saturated, and benzene is aromatic; neither decolorizes bromine water under normal conditions. This fits.\n    *   **Hydrogenation**:\n        *   Hydrogenation of X: Cyclohexene and cyclohexa-1,4-diene both hydrogenate to cyclohexane (Z).\n        *   Hydrogenation of Y: Cyclohexane is already Z. Benzene hydrogenates under severe conditions to cyclohexane (Z).\n    *   All conditions of the problem are met by this model.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n    *   Component A: Cyclohexene (C6H10) has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Component B: Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8) has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n    The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let's determine its molecular formula.\n    Mass fraction of H = (mass of H) / (total molecular mass)\n    0.1428 is very close to 1/7.\n    Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is approximately `y / (12x + y)`.\n    If the hydrocarbon is a saturated cycloalkane, its general formula is CnH2n.\n    The mass fraction of H would be `2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 2/14 = 1/7`.\n    This matches the given value perfectly (1/7 ≈ 0.142857).\n    If the hydrocarbon were a saturated alkane (CnH2n+2), the mass fraction of H would be `(2n+2) / (12n + 2n+2) = (2n+2) / (14n+2)`. Setting this to 1/7 gives `7(2n+2) = 14n+2`, which simplifies to `14n + 14 = 14n + 2`, or `14 = 2`, which is impossible.\n    Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n.\n\n2.  **Determine the Carbon Skeleton**\n    The problem states that hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y under severe conditions gives *only one* substance, Z. This is a critical clue. It means that all the chemical compounds present in mixtures X and Y have the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n    Z is also described as a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane, C6H12. This fits the formula CnH2n with n=6.\n    So, we can confidently identify Z as **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. Consequently, all compounds in mixtures X and Y are C6 compounds with a six-membered ring structure.\n\n3.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n    Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids formed from the disproportionation of X.\n    Y does *not* decolorize bromine water, which means its components are either saturated or aromatic.\n    We know that Z (cyclohexane, C6H12) is one of the components of Y. Cyclohexane is saturated.\n    Disproportionation reactions of unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbons, especially catalyzed by platinum, typically involve hydrogen transfer, producing a fully saturated molecule and a fully dehydrogenated (aromatic) molecule.\n    The fully dehydrogenated C6 ring is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene is aromatic and does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions.\n    Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n    Let's check this: Hydrogenation of mixture Y (cyclohexane + benzene) would yield:\n    *   Cyclohexane (C6H12) + H2 → No reaction (it's already saturated).\n    *   Benzene (C6H6) + 3H2 → Cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    The only product is cyclohexane (Z), which matches the problem statement.\n\n4.  **Identify the Components of Mixture X**\n    Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n    The reaction is a disproportionation that forms the equimolar mixture Y. Since both X and Y are equimolar mixtures, the reaction stoichiometry is likely 1:1.\n    A + B → Cyclohexane + Benzene\n    C6Hx + C6Hy → C6H12 + C6H6\n    To balance the hydrogen atoms, the total number of hydrogens in the reactants must equal the total in the products:\n    x + y = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    So, the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B must be 18.\n\n    Now we need to identify A and B based on the properties of mixture X:\n    *   They are C6 compounds with a six-membered ring skeleton.\n    *   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, so A and/or B must be unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds). They are cycloalkenes or cycloalkadienes.\n    *   There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules.\n\n    Let's list the possible candidates:\n    *   **Cyclohexene (C6H10)**: Has one double bond. It is not conjugated. This is a valid candidate. (x=10)\n    *   **Cyclohexadienes (C6H8)**: Have two double bonds.\n        *   1,3-Cyclohexadiene: The double bonds are conjugated. This is excluded by the problem statement.\n        *   **1,4-Cyclohexadiene**: The double bonds are separated by two single bonds (non-conjugated). This is a valid candidate. (y=8)\n\n    Since X is a mixture of \"two liquids,\" A and B must be different. The only valid candidates are cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene.\n    Let A = Cyclohexene (C6H10).\n    Let B = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n\n    Let's check the hydrogen sum: x + y = 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our requirement perfectly.\n    The reaction is a hydrogen transfer: the more unsaturated 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) is oxidized to benzene (C6H6) by losing 2H, and the less unsaturated cyclohexene (C6H10) is reduced to cyclohexane (C6H12) by gaining those 2H.\n    C6H8 + C6H10 --(Pt, heat)--> C6H6 + C6H12\n    This entire scheme is chemically consistent and fits all the clues provided in the problem.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer**\n    The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of the number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n    *   Liquid 1 (Cyclohexene, C6H10) has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Liquid 2 (1,4-Cyclohexadiene, C6H8) has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n\nThe problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let the molecular formula of Z be CxHy. The atomic mass of Carbon (C) is approximately 12 g/mol, and Hydrogen (H) is approximately 1 g/mol.\n\nThe mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as:\nMass Fraction of H = (Total mass of H) / (Total mass of hydrocarbon)\n0.1428 = (y * 1) / (x * 12 + y * 1)\n\nTo find the ratio of y to x:\n0.1428 * (12x + y) = y\n1.7136x + 0.1428y = y\n1.7136x = y - 0.1428y\n1.7136x = 0.8572y\ny / x = 1.7136 / 0.8572 ≈ 2\n\nThis means the empirical formula for Z is CH2. The general formula for a hydrocarbon with this empirical formula is (CH2)n or CnH2n.\n\nThe problem also states that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (it does not react further with hydrogen) and is widely used as a solvent. A hydrocarbon with the general formula CnH2n that is saturated must be a cycloalkane. A very common cycloalkane used as a solvent is cyclohexane, which has the formula C6H12.\n\nLet's verify the mass fraction of hydrogen for cyclohexane (C6H12) using integer masses:\nMass fraction of H = (12 * 1) / (6 * 12 + 12 * 1) = 12 / (72 + 12) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857.\nThis matches the given value of 14.28%. Therefore, substance Z is cyclohexane (C6H12).\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n\nMixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One of its constituents is Z, which we have identified as cyclohexane (C6H12). Let the other component be W.\nSo, Y = {cyclohexane (C6H12), W}.\n\nWe know that mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water. Cyclohexane is a saturated alkane and does not react with bromine water. Therefore, W must also be a substance that does not decolorize bromine water. This means W is likely a saturated or aromatic compound.\n\nFurthermore, the hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n*   Hydrogenation of cyclohexane (C6H12) yields cyclohexane (no reaction as it's already saturated).\n*   Hydrogenation of W must yield cyclohexane (C6H12).\n\nIf W were a saturated hydrocarbon, to be converted to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation, it would need to be an isomer of cyclohexane (like methylcyclopentane). However, the problem says mixture Y is formed from disproportionation, which typically involves changes in the degree of unsaturation. A more fitting candidate for W is an aromatic compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane. The only C6 aromatic hydrocarbon is benzene (C6H6).\n\nLet's check if benzene fits the description:\n*   Hydrogenation of benzene under severe conditions (as stated in the problem) gives cyclohexane: C6H6 + 3H2 --(Pt)--> C6H12. This fits.\n*   Benzene does not decolorize bromine water under standard conditions (it undergoes substitution, not addition, and the reaction is not with bromine water). This fits.\n\nTherefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Mixture X**\n\nMixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B. When heated with platinum, X undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form Y.\nA disproportionation reaction in this context is a hydrogen transfer reaction, where some molecules are hydrogenated (gain H) and others are dehydrogenated (lose H).\n\nThe overall reaction is:\nMixture X (A + B) → Mixture Y (C6H12 + C6H6)\n\nSince the mixtures are equimolar, the reaction at the molecular level is:\nA + B → C6H12 + C6H6\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, the number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the equation.\n*   The hydrogenation of both A and B gives only cyclohexane (C6H12). This implies that both A and B must have a C6 carbon skeleton. Let their formulas be C6Ha and C6Hb.\n*   The reaction becomes: C6Ha + C6Hb → C6H12 + C6H6.\n\nNow, let's balance the hydrogen atoms:\nTotal H atoms in reactants = Total H atoms in products\na + b = 12 + 6\na + b = 18\n\nThe problem asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This corresponds to the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of liquid A and one molecule of liquid B, which is `a + b`.\n\nBased on our stoichiometric analysis, this sum is 18.\n\nThe other pieces of information (X decolorizes bromine water, no conjugated bonds) help confirm the identities of A and B (likely cyclohexene, C6H10, and 1,4-cyclohexadiene, C6H8, where 10 + 8 = 18), but they are not required to find the total number of hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each of the two liquids in mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the hydrocarbon Z.**\n\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n*   Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CxHy.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by: `(y * AtomicMass_H) / (x * AtomicMass_C + y * AtomicMass_H) = 0.1428`.\n*   Using approximate atomic masses (C=12, H=1), the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`.\n*   Let's calculate the ratio of C to H atoms. Mass fraction of Carbon = 100% - 14.28% = 85.72%.\n*   Ratio of moles `C:H = (85.72 / 12) : (14.28 / 1) = 7.14 : 14.28`.\n*   Dividing by the smaller number (7.14), we get the ratio `1 : 2`.\n*   The empirical formula of Z is CH2. The molecular formula is (CH2)n, or CnH2n.\n*   Let's verify the mass fraction for CnH2n: `MassFraction(H) = (2n * 1) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857...`, which matches the given 14.28%.\n*   The problem states that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (it does not react further with hydrogen). A saturated hydrocarbon with the general formula CnH2n must be a **cycloalkane**.\n*   Z is also described as being \"widely used as a solvent\". The most common cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. Let's assume Z is cyclohexane. This assumption will be verified against the other conditions.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the components of mixture Y.**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids formed from X.\n*   Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane, C6H12).\n*   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of mixture Y.\n*   Let the two components of Y be Y1 and Y2. We know Y1 is Z, so Y1 is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n*   The other component, Y2, must also produce only cyclohexane upon hydrogenation under severe conditions. It also must not decolorize bromine water. A very common C6 hydrocarbon that fits this description is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene is aromatic and does not react with bromine water, and its hydrogenation yields cyclohexane.\n*   So, let's propose that Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**. This fits all the properties described for Y.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the components of mixture X and the reaction.**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2.\n*   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, meaning at least one component (and likely both) is an unsaturated hydrocarbon (contains C=C or C≡C bonds).\n*   The molecules in X have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This implies that both X1 and X2 have a six-carbon ring skeleton.\n*   Mixture Y = {cyclohexane, benzene} is formed from mixture X = {X1, X2} via disproportionation. This suggests a hydrogen transfer reaction where one component of X is hydrogenated and the other is dehydrogenated.\n*   Since the product mixture Y is equimolar, the reaction stoichiometry must be 1:1:1:1.\n    `X1 + X2 --(Pt, heat)--> Y1 + Y2`\n    `X1 + X2 --> C6H12 + C6H6`\n*   By conservation of atoms, the total number of carbon and hydrogen atoms must be the same on both sides. Both X1 and X2 have a C6 skeleton.\n    `C6Ha + C6Hb --> C6H12 + C6H6`\n    This means the total number of hydrogen atoms must balance: `a + b = 12 + 6 = 18`.\n*   We need to find two unsaturated, non-conjugated C6-ring compounds, C6Ha and C6Hb, such that their hydrogen counts sum to 18.\n    *   **Cyclohexene (C6H10)** is a C6-ring with one double bond. It is not conjugated. `a=10`.\n    *   **Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)** is a C6-ring with two double bonds. The double bonds are at positions 1 and 4, so they are isolated, not conjugated. `b=8`.\n*   Let's check if this pair works: `a + b = 10 + 8 = 18`. This is a perfect match.\n*   So, mixture X is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)**.\n*   The overall reaction is a hydrogen transfer:\n    `Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8) + Cyclohexene (C6H10) --> Benzene (C6H6) + Cyclohexane (C6H12)`\n    Here, cyclohexene is reduced (hydrogenated) to cyclohexane, and cyclohexa-1,4-diene is oxidized (dehydrogenated) to benzene. All conditions are satisfied.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final answer.**\n\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   The two liquids are cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8).\n*   Total hydrogen atoms = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexene) + (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexa-1,4-diene)\n*   Total hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms is 18. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z:**\n    *   The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CₓHᵧ. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by `(y * 1.008) / (x * 12.011 + y * 1.008)`. For simplicity, we can use integer masses: `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   Let's test the general formula for cycloalkanes, CₙH₂ₙ. The mass fraction of hydrogen would be `2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7`.\n    *   Calculating `1/7` as a percentage gives `(1/7) * 100% ≈ 14.2857%`. This is a perfect match for the given value.\n    *   Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   The problem also states that Z is a liquid widely used as a solvent and does not react further with hydrogen (it's saturated). The most common cycloalkane fitting this description is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n2.  **Determine the Components of Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   We are told that Z (cyclohexane) is one of the components of mixture Y.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives *only* Z (cyclohexane). This means both components of Y must have a six-carbon skeleton.\n    *   Let the components of Y be Y₁ and Y₂. We know Y₁ is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The other component, Y₂, must also produce cyclohexane upon hydrogenation. Since Y₂ does not decolorize bromine water, it cannot be an alkene. The only common C₆ compound that is not an alkene but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic and does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions, but it is hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions (high temperature/pressure).\n    *   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction from Mixture X to Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture X (an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X₁ and X₂) is converted into mixture Y (cyclohexane and benzene) through a disproportionation reaction. A disproportionation reaction is one where a substance is simultaneously oxidized and reduced. In this context, it refers to a hydrogen transfer reaction.\n    *   The reaction is: `X₁ + X₂ --(Pt, heat)--> C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆`\n    *   We are also told that hydrogenating mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This implies that both X₁ and X₂ are C₆ hydrocarbons with a ring structure, which become C₆H₁₂ upon adding hydrogen.\n    *   The reaction involves molecules that all have 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, we can find the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (mixture X) by applying the law of conservation of mass to the hydrogen atoms.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms in Mixture X:**\n    *   According to the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n    *   Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n    *   Total H atoms in products = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X (one molecule of each) must also be 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n(For a complete picture, a plausible identity for mixture X would be cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈). They both decolorize bromine water, have no conjugated bonds, and their total hydrogen count is 10 + 8 = 18. The disproportionation reaction `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` is chemically sound.)\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z.**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CxHy. The mass percentage of hydrogen is given by `(y * AtomicMass_H) / (x * AtomicMass_C + y * AtomicMass_H) * 100`.\n    *   Using integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1) for simplicity, the fraction of hydrogen mass is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   14.28% is very close to 100/7. So, `y / (12x + y) ≈ 1/7`.\n    *   This gives `7y ≈ 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y ≈ 12x`, or `y ≈ 2x`.\n    *   A hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n can be either an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z is formed after hydrogenation under severe conditions and does not react further with hydrogen. This indicates that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon.\n    *   Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n.\n    *   Let's verify the mass percentage for CnH2n using integer masses:\n        `Mass % H = (2n * 1) / (n * 12 + 2n * 1) * 100 = 2n / 14n * 100 = (1/7) * 100 = 14.2857...%`. This is a perfect match.\n    *   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane (C6H12). Let's assume Z is cyclohexane for now and check if it fits all other conditions.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y and the Hydrogenation Process.**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only one substance, Z.\n    *   Z (cyclohexane, C6H12) is a constituent of mixture Y.\n    *   Let mixture Y = {Y1, Y2}. We can set Y1 = Z = Cyclohexane.\n    *   Hydrogenating Y, which is {Cyclohexane, Y2}, gives only Cyclohexane.\n        *   Hydrogenating Cyclohexane gives Cyclohexane (no reaction).\n        *   Therefore, hydrogenating Y2 must also yield Cyclohexane.\n    *   Since Y does not decolorize bromine water, Y2 must be a saturated compound or an aromatic compound that can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane. The most logical candidate for Y2 is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene does not react with bromine water without a catalyst, and its hydrogenation yields cyclohexane: C6H6 + 3H2 → C6H12.\n    *   So, Mixture Y = {Cyclohexane (C6H12), Benzene (C6H6)}. This is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that fit the description.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Disproportionation Reaction.**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2.\n    *   X decolorizes bromine water, so X1 and X2 are unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds).\n    *   There are no conjugated multiple bonds in X's components.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means both X1 and X2 have a six-membered ring carbon skeleton.\n    *   The reaction from X to Y is a disproportionation on a platinum catalyst:\n        X1 + X2 → Y1 + Y2 (equimolar)\n        Substituting our findings:\n        X1 + X2 → Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)\n    *   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One molecule is hydrogenated (gaining hydrogen) and the other is dehydrogenated (losing hydrogen). To balance the hydrogen atoms:\n        H_atoms(X1) + H_atoms(X2) = H_atoms(C6H12) + H_atoms(C6H6)\n        H_atoms(X1) + H_atoms(X2) = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   Since X1 and X2 are unsaturated compounds with a cyclohexane skeleton, they must be cyclohexene or cyclohexadienes.\n        *   Cyclohexane: C6H12\n        *   Cyclohexene: C6H10\n        *   Cyclohexadienes: C6H8\n    *   We need two different compounds from this list whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18. The only possible combination is **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and a **cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n        10 + 8 = 18. This is a perfect match.\n    *   The problem specifies \"no conjugated multiple bonds\". Cyclohexene has only one double bond. For the cyclohexadiene (C6H8), there are two isomers: cyclohexa-1,3-diene (conjugated) and **cyclohexa-1,4-diene** (non-conjugated). Therefore, the diene must be cyclohexa-1,4-diene.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion and Answer.**\n    *   The two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8).\n    *   The reaction is:\n        C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (cyclohexa-1,4-diene) --[Pt, heat]--> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in cyclohexene) + (H atoms in cyclohexa-1,4-diene)\n    *   Total H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z:**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon, so its formula is C_n H_m.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%, which is equivalent to 14.28 / 100 ≈ 1/7.\n    *   The formula for the mass fraction of hydrogen is: `(m * Ar(H)) / (n * Ar(C) + m * Ar(H))`, where Ar(H) ≈ 1 and Ar(C) ≈ 12.\n    *   So, `m / (12n + m) ≈ 1/7`.\n    *   This gives `7m ≈ 12n + m`, which simplifies to `6m ≈ 12n`, or `m ≈ 2n`.\n    *   The empirical formula of Z is CH₂.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a saturated hydrocarbon.\n    *   A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula C_n H_{2n} must be a monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane). Alkanes have the formula C_n H_{2n+2}.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One of them is Z (the cycloalkane, C_n H_{2n}). Let's call the other liquid D.\n    *   Mixture Y = {Z, D}.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water. Since Z is a saturated cycloalkane, it does not react. This means D also must not decolorize bromine water.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only substance Z.\n        *   Hydrogenating Z (a saturated cycloalkane) will just yield Z itself.\n        *   Hydrogenating D must therefore also yield Z.\n    *   For D to be hydrogenated to Z, it must have the same carbon skeleton as Z but be unsaturated. Since D does not decolorize bromine water, it cannot be a typical alkene or alkyne. This strongly indicates that D is an aromatic compound (an arene). Aromatic compounds only react with hydrogen under severe conditions (high pressure/temperature) and do not react with bromine water.\n    *   So, Z is a cycloalkane C_n H_{2n}, and D is the corresponding aromatic compound (arene) with the formula C_n H_{2n-6} (for a single benzene ring structure).\n    *   This structure requires n ≥ 6, as the smallest aromatic ring is benzene (C₆).\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Reaction:**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n    *   X decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only substance Z. This means both A and B, when hydrogenated, form Z. Thus, A and B must also have the same C_n carbon skeleton as Z and D. They must be cycloalkenes or cyclodienes.\n    *   The reaction is: Mixture X --(Pt, heat)--> Mixture Y. This is described as a disproportionation. In this context, it's a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component is reduced (gains hydrogen) and the other is oxidized (loses hydrogen).\n    *   The reaction is: A + B → Z + D.\n    *   Since A and B are cycloalkenes/dienes that form the cycloalkane Z, and D is an aromatic compound, the most logical composition for A and B is one cycloalkene and one cyclodiene.\n        *   Let A be the cycloalkene: C_n H_{2n-2}.\n        *   Let B be the cyclodiene: C_n H_{2n-4}.\n    *   The reaction becomes: C_n H_{2n-2} (A) + C_n H_{2n-4} (B) → C_n H_{2n} (Z) + C_n H_{2n-6} (D).\n        *   Let's check the hydrogen balance: Left side = (2n-2) + (2n-4) = 4n-6. Right side = (2n) + (2n-6) = 4n-6. The reaction is balanced.\n        *   The cycloalkene (A) is hydrogenated to the cycloalkane (Z), and the cyclodiene (B) is dehydrogenated to the aromatic compound (D). This is a plausible disproportionation (hydrogen transfer) that produces an equimolar mixture Y from an equimolar mixture X.\n    *   The problem also states that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X. This means the cyclodiene (B) must have isolated double bonds (e.g., a 1,4-diene, not a 1,3-diene).\n\n4.  **Determine the value of 'n' and the Final Answer:**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is the sum of hydrogens in A and B.\n    *   Total H atoms = (2n-2) + (2n-4) = 4n-6.\n    *   We need to find 'n'. The problem is constructed such that the answer should be one of the options. Let's test the options that correspond to integer values of n.\n        *   A) 18: If 4n-6 = 18, then 4n = 24, which gives n=6. This is a valid solution.\n        *   B) 12: If 4n-6 = 12, then 4n = 18, which gives n=4.5 (not an integer).\n        *   C) 22: If 4n-6 = 22, then 4n = 28, which gives n=7. This is also a valid solution.\n        *   D) 16: If 4n-6 = 16, then 4n = 22, which gives n=5.5 (not an integer).\n    *   We have two plausible scenarios:\n        *   **Scenario n=6:** Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), D is benzene (C₆H₆). A is cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀), and B is 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈). Total H atoms in X = 10 + 8 = 18.\n        *   **Scenario n=7:** Z is methylcyclohexane (C₇H₁₄), D is toluene (C₇H₈). A is methylcyclohexene (C₇H₁₂), and B is a non-conjugated methylcyclohexadiene (C₇H₁₀). Total H atoms in X = 12 + 10 = 22.\n    *   Both scenarios are chemically sound and fit all the conditions. However, in the absence of further information, chemistry problems of this type usually refer to the most fundamental parent compounds. The cyclohexane/benzene system (n=6) is the quintessential example of this type of chemistry, often used as the primary illustration in textbooks. Therefore, it is the most probable intended answer.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Assuming n=6, the two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. Let's determine the empirical formula of Z.\n    *   The mass fraction of Carbon is 100% - 14.28% = 85.72%.\n    *   Let's find the ratio of moles of H to C. Assuming 100g of substance, we have 14.28 g of H and 85.72 g of C.\n    *   Moles of H = 14.28 g / 1.008 g/mol ≈ 14.17 mol.\n    *   Moles of C = 85.72 g / 12.011 g/mol ≈ 7.14 mol.\n    *   The ratio of H atoms to C atoms is approximately 14.17 / 7.14 ≈ 2.\n    *   Alternatively, using the approximation C=12 and H=1, a mass fraction of H of 14.28% is very close to 1/7. For a hydrocarbon CnHx, the mass fraction of H is `x / (12n + x)`. Setting this to 1/7 gives `7x = 12n + x`, which simplifies to `6x = 12n`, or `x = 2n`.\n    *   So, the general formula for Z is CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (it does not react further with hydrogen). An acyclic saturated hydrocarbon is an alkane (CnH2n+2), and a cyclic saturated hydrocarbon is a cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n    *   Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvents are cyclohexane (C6H12) and methylcyclohexane (C7H14), both of which fit the formula CnH2n.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y contains two liquids, let's call them C and D, in an equimolar ratio.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water. This implies that C and D are saturated compounds. However, aromatic compounds like benzene and toluene also do not decolorize bromine water under standard test conditions, so they are a possibility.\n    *   Z is a constituent of Y. Let's say C = Z. So, C is a cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y under severe conditions gives only Z.\n        *   Hydrogenation of C (which is Z) naturally gives Z.\n        *   Hydrogenation of D must also give Z. If D were a saturated isomer of Z (like methylcyclopentane is to cyclohexane), this would be possible via isomerization under severe conditions. However, a more elegant solution exists if we consider aromatic compounds. Aromatic compounds are \"unsaturated\" in structure but \"saturated\" in the bromine water test. They readily hydrogenate to the corresponding cycloalkane.\n    *   Let's hypothesize that D is the aromatic derivative corresponding to the cycloalkane Z.\n        *   If Z is cyclohexane (C6H12), then D would be benzene (C6H6).\n        *   If Z is methylcyclohexane (C7H14), then D would be toluene (C7H8).\n    *   This hypothesis is strong because hydrogenation of benzene gives cyclohexane, and hydrogenation of toluene gives methylcyclohexane. Thus, hydrogenation of Y = {cyclohexane, benzene} gives only cyclohexane, and hydrogenation of Y = {methylcyclohexane, toluene} gives only methylcyclohexane. This fits all the conditions for Y.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Reaction**\n    *   Mixture X contains two liquids, A and B, in an equimolar ratio.\n    *   X decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and/or B contain C=C or C≡C bonds.\n    *   There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of X.\n    *   Hydrogenation of X gives only Z. This is a crucial clue: it means that both A and B must have the same carbon skeleton, and this skeleton is that of Z.\n    *   The reaction X → Y is a disproportionation that produces an equimolar mixture. This suggests a 1:1 reaction: A + B → C + D.\n\n4.  **Construct the Reaction**\n    *   Let's combine our findings. We have a reaction where A and B react to form C and D in a 1:1 ratio.\n        `A + B → C + D`\n    *   Let's test the C6 case: Z = cyclohexane (C6H12).\n        *   Y = {cyclohexane (C), benzene (D)}. So C = C6H12 and D = C6H6.\n        *   The reaction is `A + B → C6H12 + C6H6`. To balance atoms, A and B must be C6 compounds, and the total atom count must match. The products have C12 and H18. So A+B must be C12H18.\n        *   Since A and B must hydrogenate to cyclohexane, they must be C6 compounds with a six-membered ring. Let's find two such compounds whose formulas sum to C12H18. The most plausible candidates are cyclohexene (C6H10) and a cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n        *   `C6H10 + C6H8` gives C12H18. This matches.\n        *   The specific diene must be non-conjugated. Cyclohexa-1,4-diene is non-conjugated. Cyclohexa-1,3-diene is conjugated. So, B must be cyclohexa-1,4-diene.\n        *   Let's propose the final set of compounds:\n            *   X = {cyclohexene (A, C6H10), cyclohexa-1,4-diene (B, C6H8)}\n            *   Y = {cyclohexane (C, C6H12), benzene (D, C6H6)}\n            *   Z = cyclohexane (C6H12)\n        *   This system fits all the conditions of the problem perfectly. The reaction `C6H10 + C6H8 → C6H12 + C6H6` is a known type of hydrogen transfer reaction, driven by the formation of the stable aromatic ring, and it qualifies as a disproportionation.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   Liquid A is cyclohexene, C6H10, which has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Liquid B is cyclohexa-1,4-diene, C6H8, which has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n*(Self-correction: A similar consistent scenario can be constructed for the C7 case (Z=methylcyclohexane), leading to a total H count of 22. However, the cyclohexane/benzene system is the most fundamental and classic example of this type of transformation, making it the most likely intended answer in a chemistry problem of this nature.)*\n\nThe two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8).\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n    *   Let the formula of Z be CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by (y * mass_H) / (x * mass_C + y * mass_H).\n    *   Using approximate atomic masses (C=12, H=1), the fraction is y / (12x + y).\n    *   Setting this equal to 14.28% or 0.1428:\n        y / (12x + y) ≈ 1/7\n        7y = 12x + y\n        6y = 12x\n        y = 2x\n    *   This means the empirical formula of Z is CH2. The general molecular formula is CnH2n. This formula corresponds to either an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen. Alkenes react with hydrogen (hydrogenation), but saturated cycloalkanes do not (under most conditions). Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   We are also told that Z is widely used as a solvent and is a liquid. The most common cycloalkane that fits this description is cyclohexane (C6H12). Let's check the mass percent for C6H12 with more precise atomic masses (C≈12.01, H≈1.01):\n        Mass of H = 12 * 1.01 = 12.12\n        Mass of C = 6 * 12.01 = 72.06\n        Total Mass = 84.18\n        %H = (12.12 / 84.18) * 100% ≈ 14.4%, which is close to 14.28%. The y=2x relationship is very strong.\n    *   The entire reaction scheme involves conversions that give a single product Z upon hydrogenation. This strongly implies all key compounds (A, B, C, D) share the same carbon skeleton, which is the C6 skeleton of cyclohexane.\n    *   Therefore, **Z is cyclohexane, C6H12**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, C and D.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water, which means C and D are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   Z (cyclohexane) is itself a constituent of mixture Y. Let's say **C = Z = cyclohexane (C6H12)**. Cyclohexane is saturated and does not decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenating it gives itself.\n    *   Now for substance D: It must be hydrogenated to cyclohexane (C6H12), meaning it has a C6 skeleton. It must not decolorize bromine water. The most common compound fitting this description is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene does not react with bromine water (without a catalyst) and is hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n    *   So, **mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Transformation from X to Y**\n    *   Mixture X (an equimolar mixture of liquids A and B) is converted to mixture Y (cyclohexane and benzene) upon heating with platinum.\n    *   The reaction is described as a disproportionation. In this context, it implies a hydrogen transfer reaction where one species is hydrogenated (reduced) and another is dehydrogenated (oxidized).\n    *   The overall reaction can be written as a 1:1 reaction between the components of the equimolar mixture X to form the components of the equimolar mixture Y:\n        A + B → C + D\n        A + B → C6H12 + C6H6\n    *   All compounds (A, B, C, D) have a C6 skeleton. Let the formula for A be C6Ha and for B be C6Hb.\n    *   By the principle of conservation of atoms, the number of hydrogen atoms must be equal on both sides of the equation:\n        Number of H in (A + B) = Number of H in (C6H12 + C6H6)\n        a + b = 12 + 6\n        a + b = 18\n\n4.  **Determine the Final Answer**\n    *   The question asks for the \"total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X\". This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of liquid A and one molecule of liquid B.\n    *   From our analysis, this sum is a + b, which we calculated to be 18.\n\n5.  **Consistency Check**\n    *   Does mixture X decolorize bromine water? This means A or B (or both) must be unsaturated (contain C=C bonds).\n    *   Are there no conjugated multiple bonds in X?\n    *   Let's find plausible structures for A and B. We need two C6 cyclic hydrocarbons (that hydrogenate to cyclohexane) with a total of 18 hydrogens. A good candidate pair would be cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n        *   a = 10, b = 8. So a + b = 18. This fits.\n        *   Both cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene decolorize bromine water.\n        *   Cyclohexene has one double bond (not conjugated). 1,4-cyclohexadiene has two isolated double bonds (not conjugated). This fits the condition. 1,3-cyclohexadiene would be ruled out because it is conjugated.\n        *   The reaction would be a hydrogen transfer: C6H10 (acceptor) + C6H8 (donor) → C6H12 + C6H6. This is a known type of reaction.\n    *   The existence of this plausible pair confirms our reasoning is sound. The core calculation (a+b=18) is independent of finding the exact structures but is reinforced by it.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nThis is a chemistry problem that can be solved by systematically analyzing the properties of the mixtures and substances involved.\n\n**1. Identify Substance Z**\n\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon and is saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\").\n*   Its mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28% (or 0.1428).\n*   Let's determine the general formula of Z.\n    *   For an alkane (CnH2n+2), the mass fraction of H using integer masses (C=12, H=1) is (2n+2)/(14n+2). Setting this to 0.1428 does not yield a positive integer 'n'.\n    *   For a cycloalkane (CnH2n), the mass fraction of H is (2n)/(14n) = 2/14 = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857. This is a very close match to the given 14.28%.\n*   Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane with the general formula CnH2n.\n*   The fact that hydrogenation of mixtures X and Y gives *only* Z means all components in these mixtures have the same carbon skeleton, which is a C_n ring.\n*   Z is a widely used solvent. Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclohexane (C6H12) and methylcyclohexane (C7H14).\n\n**2. Analyze Mixture Y**\n\n*   Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that do not decolorize bromine water.\n*   One component of Y is Z (the CnH2n cycloalkane). Let's call this Y1.\n*   The other component, Y2, must also have the C_n skeleton (since its hydrogenation gives Z) and must not decolorize bromine water. The most plausible candidate for Y2 is an aromatic hydrocarbon, which is relatively unreactive with bromine water.\n*   The aromatic analog of a CnH2n cycloalkane belongs to the benzene series, with the general formula CnH2n-6.\n*   So, Mixture Y consists of **Y1 = CnH2n (a cycloalkane)** and **Y2 = CnH2n-6 (an aromatic hydrocarbon)**. For this to work, Y1 and Y2 must have the same number of carbon atoms, 'n'.\n\n**3. Analyze Mixture X and the Disproportionation Reaction**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2. They both decolorize bromine water, meaning they are unsaturated.\n*   X has \"no conjugated multiple bonds\".\n*   The reaction is an equimolar mixture X being converted to an equimolar mixture Y upon heating with a Platinum catalyst. This is a disproportionation reaction, which in this context means a hydrogen transfer reaction.\n    *   `X1 + X2 -> Y1 + Y2`\n*   Since Y1 (CnH2n) is more hydrogenated and Y2 (CnH2n-6) is less hydrogenated than the starting materials X1 and X2, one component of X must have lost hydrogen (was oxidized) and the other must have gained hydrogen (was reduced).\n*   Let's check the conservation of atoms for a 1:1 reaction. The total number of hydrogens must be conserved. Let X1 be CnH_x and X2 be CnH_y.\n    *   `x + y = (2n) + (2n - 6) = 4n - 6`\n*   X1 and X2 are unsaturated versions of the cycloalkane Z. A cycloalkene would have formula CnH(2n-2), and a non-conjugated cyclodiene would be CnH(2n-4).\n*   Let's test these as components of X:\n    *   X1 = CnH(2n-2) (cycloalkene)\n    *   X2 = CnH(2n-4) (cyclodiene)\n*   Let's check our hydrogen conservation rule:\n    *   `x + y = (2n - 2) + (2n - 4) = 4n - 6`. This matches perfectly.\n*   Therefore, mixture X is composed of a cycloalkene and a non-conjugated cyclodiene with the same carbon skeleton.\n\n**4. Determine the value of 'n' (the number of Carbon atoms)**\n\nThe problem can be solved for any 'n' that results in one of the given answers. Let's test the most common simple cases.\n\n*   **Case n=6:**\n    *   Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12), a very common solvent.\n    *   Y = {Cyclohexane (C6H12), Benzene (C6H6)}.\n    *   X = {Cyclohexene (C6H10), 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)}. The 1,4-diene is chosen because it is not conjugated.\n    *   The reaction is `C6H10 + C6H8 -> C6H12 + C6H6`. This is a balanced hydrogen transfer.\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   Total H = (H in C6H10) + (H in C6H8) = 10 + 8 = **18**.\n\n*   **Case n=7:**\n    *   Z = Methylcyclohexane (C7H14), also a solvent.\n    *   Y = {Methylcyclohexane (C7H14), Toluene (C7H8)}.\n    *   X = {Methylcyclohexene (C7H12), a non-conjugated Methylcyclohexadiene (C7H10)}.\n    *   The reaction is `C7H12 + C7H10 -> C7H14 + C7H8`. This is also a balanced hydrogen transfer.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms in mixture X.\n    *   Total H = (H in C7H12) + (H in C7H10) = 12 + 10 = **22**.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nBoth n=6 and n=7 lead to plausible scenarios and correspond to options D (18) and A (22). However, problems of this nature in chemistry competitions or textbooks typically refer to the simplest, most fundamental parent system unless specified otherwise. The C6 system (cyclohexane/benzene) is the archetypal example for this type of transformation (hydrogenation, disproportionation, aromaticity). Therefore, the C6 system is the most probable intended answer.\n\nThe liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze and identify hydrocarbon Z.**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon. Let its general formula be CxHy.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is given as 14.28%. Let's convert this percentage to a fraction: 14.28% ≈ 14.28 / 100 ≈ 1/7.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen can be expressed using the atomic masses of Carbon (≈12 amu) and Hydrogen (≈1 amu): Mass fraction (H) = `(y * 1) / (x * 12 + y * 1)`.\n    *   Setting this equal to 1/7: `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`.\n    *   Cross-multiplying gives: `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n    *   This means the empirical formula of Z is (CH2)n, and its molecular formula is CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a saturated hydrocarbon. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Z is also described as being widely used as a solvent. The most common and simple cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane, C6H12. This fits the CnH2n formula with n=6. Let's assume Z is cyclohexane.\n\n2.  **Analyze and identify mixture Y.**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. Let's call them Y1 and Y2.\n    *   Y is formed by the disproportionation of mixture X on a heated platinum catalyst.\n    *   Z (cyclohexane, C6H12) is a constituent of mixture Y. So, let's say Y1 = cyclohexane.\n    *   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water, which means its components are saturated or aromatic. Cyclohexane is saturated.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n        *   Hydrogenating Y1 (cyclohexane) will yield cyclohexane.\n        *   Hydrogenating Y2 must also yield cyclohexane (C6H12). This means Y2 must have a C6 carbon skeleton.\n    *   The reaction of an unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbon on a platinum catalyst to yield a mixture of an aromatic compound and a saturated cycloalkane is a well-known disproportionation reaction (specifically, a Zelinaky irreversible catalysis). For a C6 system, this reaction produces benzene and cyclohexane.\n    *   This suggests that Y2 is benzene (C6H6). Let's check if this fits the facts:\n        *   Benzene is a liquid.\n        *   Benzene does not decolorize bromine water.\n        *   Hydrogenation of benzene under severe conditions (high pressure/temperature with a catalyst like Pt) yields cyclohexane: C6H6 + 3H2 → C6H12.\n    *   Therefore, the conclusion that mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of benzene (C6H6) and cyclohexane (C6H12) is very well-supported.\n\n3.  **Determine the composition of mixture X.**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2.\n    *   It undergoes disproportionation to form mixture Y:\n        X1 + X2 → Y1 + Y2\n        X1 + X2 → C6H6 + C6H12\n    *   A chemical reaction, including disproportionation, must conserve the number of atoms of each element. By balancing the hydrogen atoms:\n        Total H atoms in (X1 + X2) = Total H atoms in (C6H6 + C6H12)\n        Total H atoms = 6 + 12 = 18.\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This corresponds to the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of X1 and one molecule of X2. This value is 18.\n\n4.  **Final verification.**\n    *   Let's ensure there exist compounds X1 and X2 that fit the remaining criteria.\n    *   Both X1 and X2 must have a C6 skeleton, as they both hydrogenate to cyclohexane.\n    *   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, so at least one (and likely both) of X1 and X2 must be an unsaturated alkene or alkyne.\n    *   The molecules in X have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   We need two C6 cyclic hydrocarbons, X1=C6Ha and X2=C6Hb, such that a + b = 18. They must be unsaturated.\n    *   Consider cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n        *   Total H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18. This matches.\n        *   Both are unsaturated and will decolorize bromine water.\n        *   Cyclohexene has one double bond (not conjugated).\n        *   1,4-cyclohexadiene has two double bonds separated by two single bonds, so they are not conjugated.\n        *   The disproportionation reaction would be a hydrogen transfer: the diene (C6H8) loses 2 H to become benzene (C6H6), and the monoene (C6H10) gains these 2 H to become cyclohexane (C6H12). This is a chemically plausible reaction:\n            C6H8 + C6H10 --(Pt, heat)--> C6H6 + C6H12\n    *   All conditions are met by this model, which confirms our calculation based on atom conservation.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each of the two liquids in mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the empirical and molecular formula of hydrocarbon Z.**\n\nZ is a hydrocarbon with the general formula CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given as 14.28%.\nMass fraction of Hydrogen = (y × Ar(H)) / (x × Ar(C) + y × Ar(H)) = 0.1428\nLet's use the approximate atomic masses: Ar(H) ≈ 1 and Ar(C) ≈ 12.\nThe mass fraction of hydrogen can be expressed as y / (12x + y).\nSo, y / (12x + y) ≈ 0.1428\nThe value 0.1428 is very close to 1/7 (1/7 ≈ 0.142857).\nLet's assume the mass fraction is exactly 1/7.\ny / (12x + y) = 1/7\n7y = 12x + y\n6y = 12x\ny = 2x\nThis means the empirical formula of Z is CH2, and the general formula is CnH2n.\n\nThe problem states that Z is formed by hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a saturated hydrocarbon. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Z and the components of mixture Y.**\n\n*   Hydrogenation of both mixtures X and Y gives only one substance, Z. This implies that all components in X and Y are based on the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n*   Z is a common solvent and a cycloalkane. The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane (C6H12). Let's test this hypothesis.\n*   For cyclohexane (C6H12), the mass fraction of hydrogen is (12 × 1.008) / (6 × 12.011 + 12 × 1.008) ≈ 14.37%, which is very close to the given 14.28%. Let's assume Z is cyclohexane.\n*   Mixture Y is formed from X, and its components do not decolorize bromine water. This means they are saturated or aromatic (aromatic rings do not react with bromine water under standard conditions).\n*   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of mixture Y. Let Y = {Z, D}.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z. This means hydrogenation of Z gives Z (it's already saturated) and hydrogenation of D gives Z.\n*   Since D is in mixture Y, it does not decolorize bromine water (it's saturated or aromatic). For D to be hydrogenated to Z (cyclohexane), it must have the same C6 carbon skeleton. A saturated C6 isomer would be something like methylcyclopentane, which has a different skeleton. However, an aromatic compound with a C6 skeleton is benzene (C6H6). Benzene can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   So, a very strong candidate for mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\nLet's check if this fits the conditions for Y:\n1.  Equimolar mixture of two liquids: Yes.\n2.  Does not decolorize bromine water: Yes, both cyclohexane (saturated) and benzene (aromatic) do not react with Br2 water.\n3.  Hydrogenation gives one substance Z: Hydrogenation of {cyclohexane, benzene} gives only cyclohexane. This fits perfectly.\n4.  Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of Y: Yes.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the components of mixture X and the reaction.**\n\nThe reaction is the conversion of mixture X into mixture Y.\nX = {A, B} → Y = {cyclohexane, benzene}\nThe reaction is an equimolar disproportionation. A disproportionation reaction in this context is a hydrogen transfer, where one molecule is reduced (gains hydrogen) and another is oxidized (loses hydrogen).\nSince we start with an equimolar mixture X = {A, B} and end with an equimolar mixture Y = {cyclohexane, benzene}, the reaction must be:\nA + B → cyclohexane (C6H12) + benzene (C6H6)\n(in a 1:1 molar ratio)\n\nFor this to be a hydrogen transfer, one reactant must be reduced to cyclohexane, and the other must be oxidized to benzene.\n*   Reduction: C6Hx + 2H → C6H12 (cyclohexane). This implies the reactant has the formula C6H10. This is **cyclohexene**.\n*   Oxidation: C6Hy - 2H → C6H6 (benzene). This implies the reactant has the formula C6H8. This could be a **cyclohexadiene**.\n\nSo, mixture X is likely composed of cyclohexene (C6H10) and a cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\nThe overall reaction is:\nC6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (cyclohexadiene) → C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)\nIn this reaction, cyclohexadiene acts as the hydrogen donor (gets oxidized to benzene), and cyclohexene acts as the hydrogen acceptor (gets reduced to cyclohexane). The hydrogen atoms are conserved (10 + 8 = 12 + 6).\n\nNow let's check if this choice for X fits all the given conditions:\n1.  Equimolar mixture of two liquids: Yes, cyclohexene and cyclohexadienes are liquids.\n2.  Decolorizes bromine water: Yes, both contain C=C double bonds.\n3.  Hydrogenation gives only Z (cyclohexane):\n    *   C6H10 + H2 → C6H12\n    *   C6H8 + 2H2 → C6H12\n    This is true.\n4.  No conjugated multiple bonds: Cyclohexene has one double bond, so no conjugation. For cyclohexadiene (C6H8), there are two isomers: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated). The problem specifies no conjugated bonds, so the component must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene**.\n\nThe model is fully consistent. Mixture X is {cyclohexene, 1,4-cyclohexadiene}.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final answer.**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   Liquid 1: Cyclohexene (C6H10) has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n*   Liquid 2: 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis number can also be found directly from the H-balance in Step 3, where the total H atoms in the reactants must equal the total H atoms in the products (12 + 6 = 18).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z.**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   14.28% is very close to 1/7 (which is approximately 14.2857%).\n    *   Let's check the general formulas for hydrocarbons to see which one gives a hydrogen mass fraction of 1/7. We can use integer atomic masses for this (C=12, H=1).\n        *   Alkanes (CnH2n+2): Mass % H = (2n+2) / (12n + 2n+2) = (2n+2) / (14n+2). This is not equal to 1/7.\n        *   Alkenes/Cycloalkanes (CnH2n): Mass % H = (2n) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 2/14 = 1/7. This matches.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a saturated compound. This rules out it being an alkene. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n.\n    *   The problem also states that Z is widely used as a solvent. Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclopentane (C5H10) and cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    *   Let's check the mass fraction for C6H12: Mass % H = (12 * 1) / (6 * 12 + 12 * 1) = 12 / (72 + 12) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%. This is a perfect match.\n    *   Therefore, **Z is cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n2.  **Identify the components of Mixture Y.**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, C and D.\n    *   Mixture Y is formed from the disproportionation of X.\n    *   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Substance Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of mixture Y. Let's say **D = Z = cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y (C + D) gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means hydrogenation of C must also yield cyclohexane.\n    *   Since Y does not decolorize bromine water, C cannot be an alkene or alkyne. It could be a saturated compound or an aromatic one.\n        *   If C is a saturated isomer of cyclohexane (like methylcyclopentane), its hydrogenation under severe conditions would break the ring and form acyclic alkanes (like hexane), not cyclohexane.\n        *   This leaves the possibility that C is an aromatic compound. Benzene (C6H6) does not decolorize bromine water (without a catalyst) and its hydrogenation gives cyclohexane (C6H6 + 3H2 → C6H12).\n    *   This fits all the criteria. Therefore, **mixture Y consists of benzene (C6H6) and cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n3.  **Identify the components of Mixture X and the reaction.**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B.\n    *   X undergoes disproportionation on a platinum catalyst to form the equimolar mixture Y.\n        *   Reaction: A + B → C + D\n        *   Substituting the known components of Y: **A + B → Benzene (C6H6) + Cyclohexane (C6H12)**\n    *   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. All molecules involved must have the same carbon skeleton, because hydrogenation of both A and B results in cyclohexane. This means A and B are C6 hydrocarbons.\n    *   Let A = C6Hx and B = C6Hy. By balancing the hydrogen atoms in the reaction:\n        *   x + y = 6 (from benzene) + 12 (from cyclohexane)\n        *   **x + y = 18**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which is precisely the sum x + y.\n\n4.  **Verify the properties of Mixture X.**\n    *   We have determined that the total number of hydrogen atoms in molecules A and B is 18. Let's find what A and B are to ensure consistency with the remaining conditions.\n    *   Condition: Mixture X decolorizes bromine water. This means A and/or B must contain C=C double bonds (i.e., they are unsaturated). Their formulas must be C6Hx where x < 12.\n    *   Condition: There are no conjugated multiple bonds in A or B.\n    *   Let's find a pair of C6-ring based unsaturated hydrocarbons (that hydrogenate to cyclohexane) such that the sum of their hydrogens is 18. The candidates are:\n        *   Cyclohexene (C6H10)\n        *   Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8) (non-conjugated)\n        *   (Cyclohexa-1,3-diene is C6H8 but is conjugated, so it is ruled out).\n    *   Let's test the pair {Cyclohexene, Cyclohexa-1,4-diene}:\n        *   Let A = Cyclohexene (C6H10) and B = Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8).\n        *   Number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our calculation.\n        *   The disproportionation reaction would be:\n            C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (cyclohexa-1,4-diene) → C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)\n            This is a chemically plausible hydrogen transfer. The diene loses 2H to become benzene, and the mono-ene gains 2H to become cyclohexane.\n        *   All other conditions are satisfied by this choice of A and B.\n\n5.  **Final Answer.**\n    *   The two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8).\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each of these liquids is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Hydrocarbon Z.**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon that does not react further with hydrogen, which means it is a saturated hydrocarbon (an alkane or a cycloalkane).\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%.\n    *   Let the formula of Z be CxHy. The mass percentage of hydrogen is given by `(y * AtomicMass(H)) / (x * AtomicMass(C) + y * AtomicMass(H)) * 100%`.\n    *   Using approximate atomic masses (H=1, C=12), the formula becomes `y / (12x + y) = 0.1428`.\n    *   This value is very close to 1/7 (`1/7 ≈ 0.142857`). Let's assume the mass percentage is 1/7.\n        *   `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`\n        *   `7y = 12x + y`\n        *   `6y = 12x`\n        *   `y = 2x`\n    *   A hydrocarbon with the formula `CnH2n` is either an alkene or a cycloalkane. Since Z is saturated, it must be a **cycloalkane**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y and the Disproportionation Reaction.**\n    *   Mixture Y is formed by the disproportionation of mixture X on a platinum catalyst. This type of reaction often involves hydrogenation and dehydrogenation.\n    *   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated (like Z) or aromatic.\n    *   The complete hydrogenation of Y gives only Z. This means any non-saturated component in Y must hydrogenate to Z. The most common stable product of dehydrogenation on Pt is an aromatic ring.\n    *   Z is a constituent of mixture Y.\n    *   Putting this together: Y is an equimolar mixture of the cycloalkane Z and a corresponding aromatic compound which, upon hydrogenation, also yields Z.\n    *   The simplest and most classic example of this system involves a six-membered ring. Let's assume Z is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**, which is a common solvent.\n    *   The corresponding aromatic compound would be **benzene (C6H6)**. Upon hydrogenation (`C6H6 + 3H2 -> C6H12`), benzene gives cyclohexane.\n    *   So, we can hypothesize:\n        *   **Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12)**\n        *   **Mixture Y = Equimolar mixture of Cyclohexane (C6H12) and Benzene (C6H6)**.\n    *   This hypothesis fits all the conditions for Y and Z.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X.**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n    *   The reaction is `A + B --(Pt, heat)--> Cyclohexane + Benzene`.\n    *   Since this is a 1:1 reaction producing a 1:1 mixture, we can deduce the elemental composition by balancing the atoms.\n        *   Reactants: A (CxHy) + B (CzHw)\n        *   Products: C6H12 + C6H6 = C12H18\n        *   Therefore, `A + B` must contain 12 carbon atoms and 18 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   The fact that hydrogenation of mixture X also yields only Z (cyclohexane) implies that both A and B must have the same carbon skeleton as cyclohexane, i._e._, a six-membered ring.\n    *   So, both A and B are C6 compounds. Their formulas must be `C6Ha` and `C6Hb`.\n        *   `a + b = 18`\n    *   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, so A and/or B must be unsaturated (contain C=C bonds).\n    *   The problem states there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the compounds of mixture X.\n\n4.  **Identify the components of Mixture X.**\n    *   We need to find two non-conjugated, unsaturated C6 ring compounds, C6Ha and C6Hb, such that `a + b = 18`.\n    *   Let's list the possibilities for unsaturated C6 ring compounds:\n        *   **Cyclohexene (C6H10)**: One double bond. Not conjugated. This is a candidate for A or B.\n        *   **Cyclohexa-1,3-diene (C6H8)**: Two double bonds. They are conjugated. This is ruled out by the problem statement.\n        *   **Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)**: Two double bonds. They are separated by two single bonds, so they are not conjugated. This is a candidate.\n    *   Let's try to form a pair (A, B) from these candidates.\n        *   If we take A = Cyclohexene (C6H10), we need B to be a C6H(18-10) = C6H8 compound. The only non-conjugated option is Cyclohexa-1,4-diene.\n    *   So, Mixture X consists of:\n        *   **A = Cyclohexene (C6H10)**\n        *   **B = Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)**\n    *   This pair fits all conditions: equimolar, both decolorize bromine water, no conjugated bonds, and their combined atom count matches the products. The reaction is a hydrogen transfer: the diene (C6H8) is oxidized to benzene (C6H6) by losing 2H, and the monoene (C6H10) is reduced to cyclohexane (C6H12) by gaining 2H.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer.**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n    *   Number of H atoms in Cyclohexene (C6H10) = 10\n    *   Number of H atoms in Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8) = 8\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis result corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z.**\n    The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CxHy.\n    The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by: (mass of H) / (total mass) = (y * AtomicMass_H) / (x * AtomicMass_C + y * AtomicMass_H).\n    Using approximate atomic masses (H=1, C=12), the equation is: y / (12x + y) = 0.1428.\n    This simplifies to y ≈ 2x.\n    The empirical formula is CH2. The general formula for a hydrocarbon with this ratio is CnH2n. This corresponds to either an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n    The problem states that Z is formed by hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z must be a saturated compound, which rules out alkenes. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n    Z is also described as a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent fitting this description is cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    Let's verify the mass fraction for cyclohexane (C6H12):\n    Mass of H = 12 * 1.008 = 12.096\n    Mass of C = 6 * 12.011 = 72.066\n    Total Mass = 12.096 + 72.066 = 84.162\n    Mass fraction of H = 12.096 / 84.162 ≈ 0.1437, which is very close to 14.28%. Using simpler masses (12 and 1), the fraction is exactly 12/84 = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857.\n    So, Z is confirmed to be **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n2.  **Determine the Carbon Skeleton of all Components.**\n    The problem states that hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y gives *only* hydrocarbon Z (cyclohexane). This implies that all components in both mixtures X and Y are compounds with a six-carbon skeleton, which can be converted to a cyclohexane ring upon hydrogenation.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture Y.**\n    Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One of its constituents is Z, which is cyclohexane (C6H12). Let's call the components Y1 and Y2. So, Y1 = cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    Mixture Y \"does not decolorize bromine water\". This typically means the components are saturated (no C=C or C≡C bonds) or aromatic.\n    Hydrogenation of Y gives only cyclohexane. We know Y1 (cyclohexane) is already saturated. For Y2, hydrogenation must also yield cyclohexane.\n    If Y2 were saturated (like Y1), the reaction producing Y would not be a disproportionation (which involves oxidation and reduction). A mixture of two saturated C6H12 isomers is not formed by disproportionation.\n    This suggests that the phrase \"does not decolorize bromine water\" should also include aromatic compounds, as they are unreactive with bromine water without a Lewis acid catalyst.\n    Let's hypothesize that Y2 is an aromatic compound with a C6 skeleton, which is **benzene (C6H6)**.\n    So, **Y = an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6)**.\n    Let's check if this hypothesis for Y fits all conditions:\n    *   It's an equimolar mixture of two liquids. (Yes)\n    *   It does not decolorize bromine water. (Yes, neither cyclohexane nor benzene do under normal conditions).\n    *   Hydrogenation gives only Z (cyclohexane). (Yes: C6H12 stays C6H12; C6H6 + 3H2 -> C6H12).\n    *   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent. (Yes).\n    This hypothesis works perfectly.\n\n4.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Disproportionation Reaction.**\n    Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2.\n    It undergoes a disproportionation reaction when heated with platinum to form Y. Disproportionation in this context is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component is oxidized (loses hydrogen), and another is reduced (gains hydrogen).\n    The reaction is: X1 + X2 → Y1 + Y2.\n    Since X and Y are both equimolar mixtures, the stoichiometry is likely 1:1:1:1.\n    X1 + X2 → C6H6 + C6H12\n    By the principle of conservation of atoms, the total number of carbon and hydrogen atoms on both sides of the equation must be equal. The carbon atoms are already balanced (6+6 on the left, 6+6 on the right). Let's balance the hydrogen atoms.\n    (H atoms in X1) + (H atoms in X2) = (H atoms in benzene) + (H atoms in cyclohexane)\n    (H atoms in X1) + (H atoms in X2) = 6 + 12 = 18.\n\n5.  **Identify the Components of Mixture X.**\n    We need to find two compounds, X1 and X2, that fit the following criteria:\n    *   They are liquids with a C6 skeleton.\n    *   They decolorize bromine water (i.e., they are unsaturated).\n    *   They do not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   Their molecules' hydrogen atoms sum to 18.\n    *   Hydrogenation of both yields cyclohexane (so they must have a C6 ring structure).\n\n    Let's consider possible unsaturated C6 ring compounds:\n    *   Cyclohexene: C6H10. It has one double bond and is not conjugated. Hydrogenation gives cyclohexane.\n    *   Cyclohexadienes: C6H8. There are two isomers:\n        *   1,3-cyclohexadiene: Has conjugated double bonds, so it's ruled out.\n        *   1,4-cyclohexadiene: Has isolated (non-conjugated) double bonds. Hydrogenation gives cyclohexane.\n\n    Now let's see which pair sums to 18 hydrogen atoms:\n    *   If X1 = cyclohexene (C6H10) and X2 = cyclohexene (C6H10), the sum is 10 + 10 = 20. (Incorrect)\n    *   If X1 = 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) and X2 = 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8), the sum is 8 + 8 = 16. (Incorrect)\n    *   If X1 = cyclohexene (C6H10) and X2 = 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8), the sum is 10 + 8 = 18. (**Correct**)\n\n    So, mixture X is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**. The reaction is:\n    C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) + C6H10 (cyclohexene) --(Pt/heat)--> C6H6 (benzene) + C6H12 (cyclohexane)\n    In this reaction, 1,4-cyclohexadiene is oxidized to benzene, and cyclohexene is reduced to cyclohexane. This is a classic example of catalytic hydrogen transfer.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Answer.**\n    The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of the hydrogen atoms in one molecule of the first liquid and one molecule of the second liquid.\n    Total H atoms = (H atoms in cyclohexene) + (H atoms in 1,4-cyclohexadiene)\n    Total H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon, with a general formula CxHy.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%, which is 0.1428.\n*   Mass fraction of H = (mass of H) / (total mass) = (y * 1) / (x * 12 + y * 1) (using approximate atomic masses H=1, C=12).\n*   0.1428 = y / (12x + y)\n*   0.1428 * (12x + y) = y\n*   1.7136x + 0.1428y = y\n*   1.7136x = 0.8572y\n*   y/x = 1.7136 / 0.8572 ≈ 2.\n*   The empirical formula of Z is CH2. The general formula is (CH2)n or CnH2n.\n*   This general formula CnH2n corresponds to either alkenes or cycloalkanes.\n*   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, which means it is a saturated compound. An alkene is unsaturated, so Z must be a saturated cycloalkane.\n\n*   We are also told that Z is widely used as a solvent. Common cycloalkane solvents are cyclopentane (C5H10) and cyclohexane (C6H12). We will proceed with the assumption that it's one of these, likely cyclohexane due to its commonality in the reactions described.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids formed from mixture X.\n*   Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated (like Z) or aromatic.\n*   One component of Y is the hydrocarbon Z (a cycloalkane).\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z. This means both components of Y, when hydrogenated, yield Z.\n*   Let's assume Z is cyclohexane (C6H12). One component of Y is cyclohexane. The other component of Y must also be a C6 liquid that hydrogenates to cyclohexane and does not decolorize bromine water. The only C6 compound that fits this description is benzene (C6H6). Benzene is aromatic and only reacts with bromine in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst, not with bromine water alone. Under severe conditions (high pressure/temperature with a catalyst), benzene can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane.\n*   So, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Components of Mixture X**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them X1 and X2.\n*   X decolorizes bromine water, so X1 and X2 are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n*   The reaction X -> Y is a disproportionation, which in this context means a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component is oxidized (loses hydrogen) and the other is reduced (gains hydrogen).\n    *   X1 + X2 --(Pt, heat)--> cyclohexane + benzene\n*   From this reaction, the stoichiometry must be 1:1 -> 1:1 because both X and Y are equimolar mixtures.\n*   Let's check the atom balance. The products are C6H12 and C6H6.\n    *   Total C atoms = 6 + 6 = 12.\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   Therefore, the reactants (one molecule of X1 and one molecule of X2) must also have a total of 12 carbon atoms and 18 hydrogen atoms.\n*   Since hydrogenating both X1 and X2 gives Z (cyclohexane, C6H12), both X1 and X2 must be C6 cyclic hydrocarbons with the same carbon skeleton as cyclohexane.\n*   So, X1 is C6Ha and X2 is C6Hb, where a + b = 18.\n*   The reaction is: C6Ha + C6Hb -> C6H12 + C6H6.\n*   This is a hydrogen transfer. One compound loses hydrogen to become benzene, and the other gains hydrogen to become cyclohexane.\n    *   One reactant must have more hydrogen than benzene (Ha > 6) and will be oxidized: C6Ha -> C6H6.\n    *   The other reactant must have less hydrogen than cyclohexane (Hb < 12) and will be reduced: C6Hb -> C6H12.\n*   The components of X are unsaturated C6 cyclic molecules, but they do not have conjugated multiple bonds. Let's list the possibilities:\n    *   **Cyclohexene (C6H10)**: One double bond, not conjugated. This is a possible component.\n    *   **Cyclohexadienes (C6H8)**:\n        *   1,3-cyclohexadiene: Has conjugated double bonds. This is ruled out by the problem statement.\n        *   **1,4-cyclohexadiene**: Has two isolated (non-conjugated) double bonds. This is a possible component.\n*   We need to find a pair from our possible components (cyclohexene C6H10 and 1,4-cyclohexadiene C6H8) such that their hydrogen atoms sum to 18.\n    *   Let X1 = cyclohexene (C6H10) and X2 = 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   Total H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our requirement.\n*   Let's check the reaction with this pair:\n    *   1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) loses 2H to become benzene (C6H6). This is oxidation.\n    *   Cyclohexene (C6H10) gains 2H to become cyclohexane (C6H12). This is reduction.\n    *   The overall reaction is C6H8 + C6H10 -> C6H6 + C6H12. This is a balanced hydrogen transfer (disproportionation).\n*   Thus, mixture X consists of cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms**\n\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n*   Liquid 1 (X1): Cyclohexene (C6H10) has **10** hydrogen atoms.\n*   Liquid 2 (X2): 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) has **8** hydrogen atoms.\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n    The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let's determine its empirical and molecular formula.\n    The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by:\n    Mass Fraction (H) = (Total mass of H) / (Total molecular mass)\n    14.28% is very close to 1/7 or ~0.142857.\n    Let's test the general formulas for hydrocarbons:\n    *   For an alkane (CnH2n+2), the mass fraction of H is (2n + 2) / (12n + 2n + 2) = (2n + 2) / (14n + 2). Setting this to 1/7 gives 14n + 14 = 14n + 2, which is impossible.\n    *   For an alkene or cycloalkane (CnH2n), the mass fraction of H is 2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 2/14 = 1/7. This matches the given value perfectly.\n    *   So, Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n.\n    The problem also states that Z is widely used as a solvent and does not react further with hydrogen, implying it is a stable, saturated compound. Cyclohexane (C6H12) is a very common solvent and is a stable cycloalkane. This fits the description.\n    Therefore, **Z is cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n2.  **Characterize Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them C and D.\n    *   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of mixture Y. So, let **C = cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n    *   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means both C and D must be saturated or aromatic compounds (which do not react with aqueous bromine under normal conditions). Cyclohexane is saturated.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means hydrogenation of C gives cyclohexane (which is trivial) and hydrogenation of D must also give cyclohexane.\n    *   We need to find a liquid D that does not decolorize bromine water and can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane. The most logical candidate, especially in the context of a disproportionation reaction involving a C6 ring, is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene is a liquid, does not decolorize bromine water, and its complete hydrogenation product is cyclohexane.\n    *   Therefore, **Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction: Mixture X → Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B.\n    *   The reaction is described as a disproportionation. In this context, it refers to a catalytic hydrogen transfer reaction where one component is reduced (gains hydrogen) and the other is oxidized (loses hydrogen).\n    *   The reaction is: `Mixture X (A + B) --(Pt, heat)--> Mixture Y (C + D)`\n    *   Substituting the components of Y, we get: `A + B → Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)`\n    *   Since X and Y are both equimolar mixtures, the reaction stoichiometry must be 1:1, meaning one molecule of A reacts with one molecule of B to produce one molecule of cyclohexane and one molecule of benzene.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms in Mixture X**\n    *   According to the principle of conservation of atoms, the total number of each type of atom must be the same on both sides of the reaction.\n    *   The problem implies that all compounds (A, B, C, D, and Z) share the same carbon skeleton, as they all yield Z upon hydrogenation. Since Z is cyclohexane (a C6 ring), A and B must also be C6 compounds.\n    *   Let's balance the hydrogen atoms for the reaction `A + B → C6H12 + C6H6`:\n    *   (Number of H atoms in A) + (Number of H atoms in B) = (Number of H atoms in C6H12) + (Number of H atoms in C6H6)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n    The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X (i.e., in one molecule of compound A and one molecule of compound B) is 18.\n\n6.  **Verification (Optional but Recommended)**\n    Can we find plausible compounds A and B?\n    *   We need H(A) + H(B) = 18.\n    *   A and B must be C6 unsaturated compounds that decolorize bromine water.\n    *   A and B must not have conjugated double bonds.\n    *   In the reaction A + B → C6H12 + C6H6, one compound gets reduced and one gets oxidized. This is a transfer of hydrogen atoms. Let's say B is reduced and A is oxidized.\n    *   B + nH → C6H12 (Reduction)\n    *   A - nH → C6H6 (Oxidation)\n    *   A logical candidate for B is **cyclohexene (C6H10)**. It gets reduced to cyclohexane by gaining 2 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   A logical candidate for A is a **cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**. It gets oxidized to benzene by losing 2 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Let's check the number of hydrogen atoms: 10 (from cyclohexene) + 8 (from cyclohexadiene) = 18. This matches our calculation.\n    *   The condition that there are no conjugated bonds means that the cyclohexadiene must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene**, not the conjugated 1,3-isomer.\n    *   So, a possible composition for Mixture X is an equimolar mix of 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) and cyclohexene (C6H10). This fits all the conditions described in the problem.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which we have determined to be 18.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere's a detailed step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Hydrocarbon Z**:\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let's determine its empirical formula.\n    *   Mass fraction of H = 14.28% = 0.1428. Mass fraction of C = 100% - 14.28% = 85.72%.\n    *   The ratio of moles C : H is (85.72 / 12.01) : (14.28 / 1.008) ≈ 7.14 : 14.17.\n    *   Dividing by the smallest number (7.14), we get a ratio of approximately 1 : 2.\n    *   Therefore, the empirical formula of Z is CH2, and its general molecular formula is (CH2)n or CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states that hydrogenation of mixtures X and Y gives *only* Z, and Z does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a saturated hydrocarbon.\n    *   A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem also mentions that Z is a constituent of mixture Y and is widely used as a solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvents are cyclopentane (C5H10) and cyclohexane (C6H12). Both fit the CnH2n formula.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y and the Disproportionation Reaction**:\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids formed from mixture X upon treatment with heated platinum. This reaction is described as a disproportionation. In heterogeneous catalysis involving hydrocarbons, \"disproportionation\" often refers to a hydrogen transfer reaction where some molecules are dehydrogenated (lose hydrogen) and others are hydrogenated (gain hydrogen).\n    *   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water, which means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Mixture Y consists of Z (our cycloalkane) and another liquid, let's call it W. So, Y = {W, Z}.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z. This means `Hydrogenation(W) -> Z` and `Hydrogenation(Z) -> Z`. Since Z is already saturated, the second part is expected. For `Hydrogenation(W) -> Z` to occur, and given that W does not decolorize bromine water, W is most likely an aromatic compound that can be hydrogenated to the cycloalkane Z.\n    *   This strongly suggests that Z is **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and W is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene is aromatic, does not decolorize bromine water, and its hydrogenation under severe conditions yields cyclohexane. Both are liquids and widely used. This seems like a very strong hypothesis.\n    *   Let's check if all components have the same carbon skeleton. Hydrogenation of X, Y, W, and Z all lead to Z (cyclohexane). This confirms all compounds in this problem are based on a C6 skeleton.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Reaction**:\n    *   We have an equimolar mixture X of two liquids, A and B. So X = {A, B}.\n    *   The reaction is: A + B --(Pt, heat)--> W + Z (in equimolar amounts).\n    *   Substituting our identified compounds: A(C6Hx) + B(C6Hy) -> Benzene(C6H6) + Cyclohexane(C6H12).\n    *   This is a hydrogen disproportionation. One molecule is fully dehydrogenated to benzene, and the other is fully hydrogenated to cyclohexane. To balance the number of hydrogen atoms, the total number of hydrogens in the reactants must equal the total in the products.\n    *   Total H atoms in reactants = x + y.\n    *   Total H atoms in products = 6 (from benzene) + 12 (from cyclohexane) = 18.\n    *   Therefore, **x + y = 18**.\n\n4.  **Identify Components of Mixture X (A and B)**:\n    *   We know A and B are two different C6 liquids.\n    *   They both decolorize bromine water, which means they are unsaturated (contain double bonds).\n    *   Their carbon skeleton is the same as cyclohexane. This implies they are cyclic C6 compounds.\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B is 18.\n    *   The problem states there are no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   Let's find plausible structures. We need two different unsaturated cyclic C6 hydrocarbons that sum to 18 hydrogens.\n    *   A cycloalkane has formula CnH2n. A cycloalkene (one double bond) is CnH2n-2. A cycloalkadiene (two double bonds) is CnH2n-4.\n    *   For n=6:\n        *   Cyclohexane (saturated): C6H12\n        *   Cyclohexene (one double bond): C6H10\n        *   Cyclohexadiene (two double bonds): C6H8\n    *   We need two different molecules from this list (or isomers) whose hydrogens sum to 18. The combination `10 + 8 = 18` works perfectly.\n    *   So, one component (A) is **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and the other (B) is a **cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n    *   The condition \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" points to **1,4-cyclohexadiene** for the C6H8 molecule, as 1,3-cyclohexadiene has conjugated double bonds.\n    *   Let's check the final setup:\n        *   Mixture X = {cyclohexene, 1,4-cyclohexadiene}. Both are liquids, decolorize bromine water, and will hydrogenate to cyclohexane.\n        *   Reaction: `Cyclohexene (C6H10) + 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)` --(Pt, heat)--> `Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)`. This is a classic, balanced disproportionation reaction.\n        *   Mixture Y = {cyclohexane, benzene}. Neither decolorizes bromine water.\n        *   Z = cyclohexane. It is part of Y. It's a solvent. Mass % H ≈ 14.3%. All conditions are perfectly met.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer**:\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   This is the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of substance A and one molecule of substance B.\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in C6H10) + (H atoms in C6H8) = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere is my thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z:**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%. Let's determine its empirical and molecular formula.\n    *   Mass % of Hydrogen = 14.28% ≈ 1/7.\n    *   Mass % of Carbon = 100% - 14.28% = 85.72% ≈ 6/7.\n    *   Ratio of atoms C:H = (%C / M_C) : (%H / M_H) = (85.72 / 12) : (14.28 / 1) ≈ 7.14 : 14.28 ≈ 1 : 2.\n    *   The empirical formula of Z is CH2.\n    *   The general formula for a hydrocarbon with this empirical formula is (CH2)n, or CnH2n. This corresponds to either an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, which means it is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   We are also told that Z is widely used as a solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvents are cyclopentane (C5H10) and cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    *   Both X and Y hydrogenate to a *single* substance Z. This implies that all components of mixtures X and Y must share the same carbon skeleton.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y and its formation:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them C and D.\n    *   Y is formed by heating mixture X with Platinum (Pt). This is a catalytic process, often associated with hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, or, as stated, disproportionation.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components (C and D) are either saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Substance Z is a constituent of mixture Y. Let's assume C is Z. So, C is a saturated cycloalkane.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y (C+D) gives only Z. This means hydrogenation of C gives Z (which is trivial, as C=Z and Z is saturated) and hydrogenation of D must also give Z.\n    *   Since D hydrogenates to Z (a cycloalkane), D must be an unsaturated or aromatic compound with the same carbon skeleton as Z. Since D does not decolorize bromine water, it must be aromatic.\n    *   So, we have a pair: a saturated cycloalkane (C=Z) and an aromatic hydrocarbon (D) with the same carbon skeleton. The most common and simple example of such a pair is cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6).\n    *   Let's check if Z = C6H12 (cyclohexane) fits the data. Hydrogenation of benzene (C6H6) gives cyclohexane (C6H12). Cyclohexane is a widely used solvent. The mass percentage of H in C6H12 is (12*1.008) / (6*12.011 + 12*1.008) ≈ 14.37%, which is very close to 14.28% (the problem likely uses integer masses where 12/(6*12+12) = 12/84 = 1/7 ≈ 0.1428). This confirms Z is likely cyclohexane.\n    *   So, Mixture Y = {Cyclohexane (C6H12), Benzene (C6H6)}.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Disproportionation Reaction:**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B.\n    *   X decolorizes bromine water, so A and/or B are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n    *   The reaction is: A + B --(Pt, heat)--> Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6). This is a disproportionation, which in this context means a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component is reduced (gains H), and the other is oxidized (loses H).\n    *   Since A and B both hydrogenate to Z (cyclohexane), they must both be unsaturated C6 cyclic hydrocarbons.\n    *   The overall reaction for the components must be: C6Hx + C6Hy → C6H12 + C6H6.\n    *   By conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms must be the same on both sides.\n    *   Total H atoms = H(A) + H(B) = H(cyclohexane) + H(benzene) = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   So we are looking for two unsaturated C6 cyclic molecules whose hydrogen counts (x and y) add up to 18.\n    *   Since A and B are unsaturated, x < 12 and y < 12.\n    *   A plausible combination is a C6H10 molecule (a cyclohexene) and a C6H8 molecule (a cyclohexadiene). 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   Let A = Cyclohexene (C6H10) and B = Cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   The reaction would be: C6H10 + C6H8 → C6H12 + C6H6.\n    *   In this reaction, cyclohexene (A) is reduced to cyclohexane by gaining 2 hydrogen atoms. Cyclohexadiene (B) is oxidized to benzene by losing 2 hydrogen atoms. The hydrogen transfer is balanced.\n    *   The problem also states there are no *conjugated* multiple bonds in mixture X. Cyclohexa-1,3-diene is conjugated. Therefore, the C6H8 molecule must be the non-conjugated isomer, cyclohexa-1,4-diene. Cyclohexene is not conjugated.\n    *   This set of molecules fits all conditions of the problem.\n    *   Mixture X = {Cyclohexene (C6H10), Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)}.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X\". This means the sum of the number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component of the mixture.\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in C6H10) + (H atoms in C6H8)\n    *   Total H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the molecular formula of hydrocarbon Z.**\nZ is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let the formula be C_n H_m.\nThe mass fraction of hydrogen is given by:\nMass % H = (m × M_H) / (n × M_C + m × M_H)\nWhere M_H ≈ 1 g/mol and M_C ≈ 12 g/mol.\n0.1428 = (m × 1) / (n × 12 + m × 1)\nLet's test the fraction 1/7, which is approximately 0.142857.\nm / (12n + m) = 1 / 7\n7m = 12n + m\n6m = 12n\nm = 2n\nSo, the general formula for Z is C_n H_{2n}.\n\nThe problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a saturated hydrocarbon. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula C_n H_{2n} must be a cycloalkane.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Z and the components of mixture Y.**\n*   Z is a cycloalkane and is widely used as a solvent. Common examples are cyclopentane (C5H10), cyclohexane (C6H12), and methylcyclohexane (C7H14).\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One of these liquids is Z. Let's call the other liquid D.\n*   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated or aromatic. Since Z is a saturated cycloalkane, D must also be saturated or aromatic.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only Z. This means that D, upon hydrogenation, also yields Z.\n*   This implies that D must have the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n*   The reaction X -> Y is a disproportionation, which in this context involves dehydrogenation and hydrogenation. This suggests D is a dehydrogenated form of a related cycloalkane, which points towards an aromatic compound.\n\nLet's test possible identities for Z:\n*   **Case n=5:** If Z is cyclopentane (C5H10), D would have to be an aromatic C5 compound that hydrogenates to cyclopentane. There are no stable neutral aromatic C5 hydrocarbons (the cyclopentadienyl anion is aromatic, but that's not what we have here). So, n=5 is unlikely.\n*   **Case n=6:** If Z is cyclohexane (C6H12), then D must be an aromatic compound with a C6 skeleton that hydrogenates to cyclohexane. The only candidate is **benzene (C6H6)**.\n    *   So, Mixture Y = {cyclohexane (C6H12), benzene (C6H6)}.\n    *   This is a mixture of two liquids. Benzene does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions. Hydrogenation of benzene gives cyclohexane. This case is perfectly consistent.\n*   **Case n=7:** If Z is methylcyclohexane (C7H14), then D must be an aromatic compound with a C7 skeleton that hydrogenates to methylcyclohexane. The candidate is **toluene (methylbenzene, C7H8)**.\n    *   So, Mixture Y = {methylcyclohexane (C7H14), toluene (C7H8)}.\n    *   This case is also perfectly consistent.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the reaction X -> Y and identify the components of mixture X.**\nThe reaction transforms an equimolar mixture X = {A, B} into an equimolar mixture Y = {Z, D}. This happens in a 1:1 molar ratio, so the overall reaction is:\nA + B → Z + D\nThis is a hydrogen transfer reaction, a type of disproportionation where one molecule is hydrogenated and the other is dehydrogenated.\nLet's balance the hydrogen atoms for the two plausible cases:\n*   **Case n=6:** A + B → C6H12 + C6H6. The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B must be 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   **Case n=7:** A + B → C7H14 + C7H8. The total number of hydrogen atoms must be 14 + 8 = 22.\n\nNow let's find A and B for each case.\n*   A and B are liquids in an equimolar mixture X.\n*   They both decolorize bromine water, so they are unsaturated (contain C=C bonds).\n*   They have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   Hydrogenation of both A and B gives only Z, so they must have the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n\nLet's analyze the candidates for X:\n*   **Case n=6 (Z = cyclohexane):**\n    *   A and B must be unsaturated C6-ring compounds (not conjugated).\n    *   Possible molecules are cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   Let's check the total hydrogen atoms: 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our requirement.\n    *   Cyclohexene has one double bond (not conjugated). 1,4-cyclohexadiene has two isolated double bonds (not conjugated). This also fits.\n    *   So, a very strong candidate for mixture X is **{cyclohexene (C6H10), 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)}**.\n*   **Case n=7 (Z = methylcyclohexane):**\n    *   A and B must be unsaturated C7-ring compounds (not conjugated) with a methylcyclohexane skeleton.\n    *   Possible molecules are methylcyclohexene isomers (C7H12) and non-conjugated methylcyclohexadiene isomers (C7H10).\n    *   Let's check the total hydrogen atoms: 12 + 10 = 22. This matches our requirement for the C7 case.\n    *   This case is also chemically plausible.\n\n**Step 4: Resolve the ambiguity and find the final answer.**\nWe have two plausible scenarios, one leading to a total of 18 hydrogen atoms in X, and another leading to 22. Both 18 (Option A) and 22 (Option B) are available choices. Such problems in a chemistry context, when ambiguous, often rely on the most fundamental or common textbook example. The disproportionation/hydrogen transfer reactions involving the C6 system (cyclohexane/cyclohexene/cyclohexadiene/benzene) are canonical examples in organic chemistry. The C7 system, while valid, is a less fundamental example. Therefore, it is most probable that the question refers to the C6 system.\n\nLet's finalize with the C6 system:\n*   Mixture X contains cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n*   Total H atoms = (H atoms in cyclohexene) + (H atoms in 1,4-cyclohexadiene)\n*   Total H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon, let's denote its formula as CnHm.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen (%H) is given as 14.28%. This value is very close to 1/7.\n    *   Let's verify this assumption. %H = (Atomic Mass of H * m) / (Atomic Mass of C * n + Atomic Mass of H * m). Using approximate atomic masses (H=1, C=12):\n        %H = m / (12n + m) = 1/7\n        7m = 12n + m\n        6m = 12n\n        m = 2n\n    *   So, the general formula for Z is CnH2n. Since Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (it does not react further with hydrogen), it must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z is \"widely used as a solvent\". The most common cycloalkane solvent fitting this description is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n    *   Let's check the mass fraction for C6H12 using more precise masses (C≈12.01, H≈1.008):\n        %H = (12 * 1.008) / (6 * 12.01 + 12 * 1.008) * 100 = 12.096 / (72.06 + 12.096) * 100 = 12.096 / 84.156 * 100 ≈ 14.37%. The given 14.28% corresponds well to the CnH2n formula, and cyclohexane is the most logical candidate based on the chemical context. Thus, **Z is cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, C and D.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components either lack C=C/C≡C bonds (are saturated) or are aromatic.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y (both C and D) gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   Z (cyclohexane) is itself a constituent of mixture Y. Let's say **D = Z = cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n    *   The other component, C, must also hydrogenate to cyclohexane (Z). It must also not decolorize bromine water. A saturated isomer of cyclohexane (like methylcyclopentane) would not typically be described as \"hydrogenating\" to cyclohexane. A much better candidate is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene does not decolorize bromine water (it requires a Lewis acid catalyst for bromination) and it is hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions (high pressure/temperature), which is mentioned in the problem.\n    *   So, mixture **Y consists of benzene (C6H6) and cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction X → Y**\n    *   Mixture X (equimolar A + B) reacts upon heating with platinum to form mixture Y (equimolar C + D).\n    *   A + B → C + D\n    *   Substituting the identities of C and D: A + B → C6H6 + C6H12.\n    *   This is a disproportionation reaction, specifically a catalytic hydrogen transfer. One component of X is oxidized (loses hydrogen) to form benzene, and the other is reduced (gains hydrogen) to form cyclohexane.\n    *   By conservation of atoms, the total number of carbon and hydrogen atoms must be the same on both sides. All substances (A, B, C, D) have a C6 skeleton.\n        C6Hx + C6Hy → C6H6 + C6H12\n    *   This implies that the total number of hydrogen atoms is conserved: x + y = 6 + 12 = 18.\n\n4.  **Identify the Components of Mixture X**\n    *   Mixture X consists of two equimolar liquids, A (C6Hx) and B (C6Hy).\n    *   Mixture X *does* decolorize bromine water, so both A and B are unsaturated (they contain C=C bonds).\n    *   The problem states there are \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" in the molecules of X.\n    *   We need to find two unsaturated C6 cyclic hydrocarbons whose hydrogen counts (x and y) sum to 18.\n    *   Common unsaturated cyclic C6 hydrocarbons include:\n        *   Cyclohexene (C6H10)\n        *   Cyclohexadienes (C6H8)\n    *   Let's check if this pair works: x=10 and y=8. The sum is 10 + 8 = 18. This fits the requirement.\n    *   Therefore, mixture X consists of a cyclohexene and a cyclohexadiene.\n    *   The condition \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" rules out 1,3-cyclohexadiene but allows for **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**. **Cyclohexene (C6H10)** only has one double bond, so it also fits this condition.\n    *   The reaction is a hydrogen transfer between these two compounds. For example:\n        C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) + C6H10 (cyclohexene) --(Pt, heat)--> C6H6 (benzene) + C6H12 (cyclohexane)\n        In this specific balanced reaction, 1,4-cyclohexadiene loses 2H to become benzene, and cyclohexene gains 2H to become cyclohexane. This is a plausible 1:1 reaction that produces an equimolar mixture.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer**\n    *   The two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in C6H10) + (H atoms in C6H8) = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. Let's determine the empirical formula. The mass fraction of carbon is 100% - 14.28% = 85.72%.\n    *   Ratio of moles C : H = (85.72 / 12.01) : (14.28 / 1.008) ≈ 7.14 : 14.17\n    *   Divide by the smallest number (7.14): C : H ≈ 1 : 1.98 ≈ 1 : 2.\n    *   So, the empirical formula of Z is CH2.\n    *   Z is also described as not reacting further with hydrogen, which means it is a saturated hydrocarbon.\n    *   A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula (CH2)n must be a cycloalkane, with the general formula CnH2n. An acyclic alkane has the formula CnH(2n+2).\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in any cycloalkane CnH2n is (2n * 1) / (n * 12 + 2n * 1) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857, which matches the given 14.28%.\n    *   So, Z is a cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y and the Hydrogenation Reactions**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One of them is Z. Let's call the other one D. So, Y = {Z, D}.\n    *   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated (like cycloalkanes) or aromatic (like benzene and its derivatives), as these do not react with bromine water under normal conditions.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives *only* substance Z.\n        *   Hydrogenation of Z (a saturated cycloalkane) gives Z.\n        *   Therefore, hydrogenation of D must also give Z.\n    *   If D were a saturated isomer of Z (e.g., if Z is cyclohexane, D could be methylcyclopentane), it would not be described as a product of disproportionation involving hydrogen transfer, and its hydrogenation to Z would require isomerization, not just simple H2 addition.\n    *   A more plausible candidate for D is an aromatic compound with the same carbon skeleton as Z. Aromatic compounds do not decolorize bromine water and can be hydrogenated to the corresponding cycloalkane.\n    *   So, if Z = CnH2n, then D must be the corresponding aromatic compound, which would have the formula CnH(2n-6) (e.g., if Z is cyclohexane C6H12, D is benzene C6H6).\n    *   This fits all the criteria for Y: an equimolar mixture {CnH2n, CnH(2n-6)} would not decolorize bromine water, and its complete hydrogenation would yield only one product, CnH2n (Z).\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Disproportionation Reaction**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B. X = {A, B}.\n    *   X decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n    *   The reaction is: X → Y. Given the equimolar nature of both mixtures, the reaction is most likely A + B → Z + D.\n    *   This is a \"disproportionation\" reaction, which in this context means a hydrogen transfer reaction. One molecule gets reduced (gains H), and one gets oxidized (loses H).\n        *   A → Z (CnH2n)  OR  B → Z (CnH2n)\n        *   B → D (CnH(2n-6)) OR  A → D (CnH(2n-6))\n    *   Let's assume A is reduced and B is oxidized.\n        *   Oxidation: B → D + hydrogen. Specifically, B → CnH(2n-6).\n        *   Reduction: A + hydrogen → Z. Specifically, A → CnH2n.\n    *   The overall reaction is a hydrogen transfer: A + B → Z + D.\n    *   The problem states that hydrogenation of mixture X also gives only Z. This means both A and B, upon hydrogenation, yield Z. This confirms they both have the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n    *   A and B are therefore unsaturated cycloalkenes or cyclodienes. The problem states there are no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   Let's identify the most likely structures for A and B.\n        *   The substance that gets hydrogenated to a cycloalkane (Z, CnH2n) is most likely a cycloalkene with the formula CnH(2n-2). It gains 2H.\n        *   The substance that gets dehydrogenated to an aromatic compound (D, CnH(2n-6)) is most likely a non-conjugated cyclodiene with the formula CnH(2n-4). It loses 2H.\n    *   So, our reaction is: CnH(2n-2) + CnH(2n-4) → CnH2n + CnH(2n-6).\n    *   Let's check the hydrogen balance: (2n-2) + (2n-4) = 4n-6. And for the products: (2n) + (2n-6) = 4n-6. The reaction is perfectly balanced.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B.\n    *   Total H = (H in A) + (H in B) = (2n-2) + (2n-4) = 4n - 6.\n    *   Now we must find the value of 'n'. We can test the answer choices.\n        *   A) Total H = 12 → 4n - 6 = 12 → 4n = 18 → n = 4.5 (not an integer, so not possible).\n        *   B) Total H = 22 → 4n - 6 = 22 → 4n = 28 → n = 7. This is a possible solution.\n        *   C) Total H = 18 → 4n - 6 = 18 → 4n = 24 → n = 6. This is a possible solution.\n        *   D) Total H = 16 → 4n - 6 = 16 → 4n = 22 → n = 5.5 (not an integer, so not possible).\n\n5.  **Distinguish Between n=6 and n=7**\n    *   We have two plausible scenarios:\n        *   **n=6**: Z is cyclohexane (C6H12). X is a mixture of cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). The total H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n        *   **n=7**: Z is methylcyclohexane (C7H14). X is a mixture of a methylcyclohexene (C7H12) and a non-conjugated methylcyclohexadiene (C7H10). The total H atoms = 12 + 10 = 22.\n    *   Both scenarios are chemically sound and fit all the conditions. However, in the absence of any information suggesting a substituted ring (like a methyl group), the most fundamental and common example should be chosen. The reaction described is a classic catalytic hydrogen transfer, and its archetypal example involves the unsubstituted C6 ring system (cyclohexane/benzene/cyclohexene/cyclohexadiene). Therefore, the most reasonable choice is n=6.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation**\n    *   For n=6, the two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 (from C6H10) + 8 (from C6H8) = 18.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let's determine its empirical formula.\n    *   Mass fraction of H = 14.28% = 0.1428.\n    *   Mass fraction of C = 100% - 14.28% = 85.72% = 0.8572.\n    *   Let's find the molar ratio of C to H. Assuming a 100g sample, we have 14.28 g of H and 85.72 g of C.\n    *   Moles of H = 14.28 g / 1.008 g/mol ≈ 14.17 mol.\n    *   Moles of C = 85.72 g / 12.011 g/mol ≈ 7.14 mol.\n    *   The ratio of H to C is Moles H / Moles C ≈ 14.17 / 7.14 ≈ 1.985, which is approximately 2.\n    *   The empirical formula of Z is CH2.\n    *   The mass fraction 14.28% is very close to 1/7. A hydrocarbon with the general formula (CH2)n, i.e., CnH2n, has a mass fraction of hydrogen of `(2n * 1) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857`. This matches the given data.\n    *   Z is described as a substance that does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a saturated hydrocarbon. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclopentane (C5H10) and cyclohexane (C6H12). We will proceed with this information.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Hydrogenation Reactions**\n    *   Hydrogenation of both mixture X (composed of liquids A and B) and mixture Y (composed of liquids C and D) yields *only* substance Z.\n    *   This implies that all four substances (A, B, C, and D) have the same carbon skeleton as Z. Upon addition of hydrogen, they all convert to Z.\n\n3.  **Identify Mixture Y and Determine the Structure of Z**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (C and D) and it does not decolorize bromine water. This indicates that C and D are saturated or aromatic compounds.\n    *   Z is a constituent of mixture Y. Let's say C = Z. Since Z is a cycloalkane (saturated), it does not decolorize bromine water, which is consistent.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z. The component C=Z is already saturated and won't react. Therefore, component D must be hydrogenated to Z: `D --(H2, Pt, severe conditions)--> Z`.\n    *   Since D does not decolorize bromine water but can be hydrogenated, it must be an aromatic compound. The hydrogenation conditions are described as \"rather severe,\" which is characteristic of the hydrogenation of aromatic rings.\n    *   Let's assume Z is cyclohexane (C6H12). Its carbon skeleton is a six-membered ring. Then D must be an aromatic compound with a six-membered ring skeleton, which is benzene (C6H6).\n    *   Hydrogenation of benzene gives cyclohexane: `C6H6 + 3H2 --> C6H12`. This is consistent.\n    *   So, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C = Z = C6H12) and benzene (D = C6H6). Both are liquids at room temperature and cyclohexane is a common solvent. Benzene does not react with bromine water without a catalyst. This hypothesis fits all the conditions for Y and Z.\n\n4.  **Identify Mixture X**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (A and B).\n    *   It decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and/or B contain non-aromatic double or triple bonds.\n    *   The problem states a disproportionation reaction occurs: `Mixture X --(Pt, heat)--> Mixture Y`.\n    *   Since the mixtures are equimolar, the reaction stoichiometry is likely 1:1 -> 1:1. So, `A + B --> C + D`.\n    *   Substituting our identified C and D: `A + B --> C6H12 + C6H6`.\n    *   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. The total atoms must be conserved. The sum of the formulas for A and B must be C12H18.\n    *   Since A and B both hydrogenate to Z (cyclohexane, C6H12), they must both be C6 hydrocarbons with a six-membered ring skeleton. Let their formulas be A = C6Hx and B = C6Hy.\n    *   From the atom balance, we have x + y = 18.\n    *   We also know A and B must be unsaturated (to decolorize bromine water) and must not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   Possible unsaturated C6 cyclic hydrocarbons with a six-membered ring are:\n        *   Cyclohexene (C6H10). It has one double bond, so no conjugation. It decolorizes bromine water.\n        *   Cyclohexadienes (C6H8). There are two isomers: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated).\n    *   The problem states \"no conjugated multiple bonds,\" so 1,3-cyclohexadiene is ruled out.\n    *   This leaves us with cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) as the candidates for A and B.\n    *   Let's check if this pair fits the condition x + y = 18.\n    *   If A = C6H10 and B = C6H8, then x = 10 and y = 8. The sum is 10 + 8 = 18. This is a perfect match.\n    *   So, mixture X consists of cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene. The disproportionation reaction is: `C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) --> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)`. This reaction is balanced and represents the transfer of two hydrogen atoms from 1,4-cyclohexadiene to cyclohexene.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This refers to the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of the first liquid (A) and one molecule of the second liquid (B).\n    *   Liquid A is cyclohexene, C6H10. It has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Liquid B is 1,4-cyclohexadiene, C6H8. It has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CxHy. The mass fraction of H is `(y * 1) / (x * 12 + y * 1)`, using integer atomic masses.\n    *   `y / (12x + y) = 0.1428`. This value is very close to 1/7 (`1/7 ≈ 0.142857`). Let's assume the intended value is 1/7.\n    *   `y / (12x + y) = 1/7` => `7y = 12x + y` => `6y = 12x` => `y = 2x`.\n    *   The general formula for Z is CnH2n.\n    *   Z does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a saturated hydrocarbon. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Z is also described as being widely used as a solvent. Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclohexane (C6H12) and methylcyclohexane (C7H14), both of which fit the CnH2n formula.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, C and D.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water, which means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only substance Z.\n    *   Z is a constituent of mixture Y. Let's say C is Z. So, C is a cycloalkane, CnH2n.\n    *   Since hydrogenation of D also produces Z (CnH2n), D must be an unsaturated hydrocarbon with the same carbon skeleton as Z. Because D does not decolorize bromine water, it must be an aromatic hydrocarbon (an arene).\n    *   The simplest aromatic hydrocarbon is benzene (C6H6). If n=6, Z would be cyclohexane (C6H12), and D would be benzene (C6H6). This fits the criteria: Y = {cyclohexane, benzene}. Neither decolorizes bromine water, and hydrogenation of benzene gives cyclohexane.\n    *   If n=7, Z would be methylcyclohexane (C7H14), and D would be toluene (methylbenzene, C7H8). This also fits the criteria.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Reaction**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B.\n    *   X decolorizes bromine water, so A and/or B must contain C=C or C≡C bonds.\n    *   Hydrogenation of X gives only Z (the cycloalkane CnH2n). This means A and B are unsaturated hydrocarbons with the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n    *   The molecules in X have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   The reaction X → Y is described as a disproportionation. Y is an equimolar mixture. This suggests the reaction stoichiometry is `A + B → C + D`. This type of reaction, involving hydrogen transfer between molecules, is common over platinum catalysts and is often broadly referred to as disproportionation in this context.\n\n4.  **Determine the Composition of Mixture X**\n    *   The reaction is `A + B → C + D`. We have established that C is a cycloalkane (CnH2n) and D is an arene (likely CnH(2n-6) for a monocyclic system).\n    *   Let's balance the hydrogen atoms: `H_atoms(A) + H_atoms(B) = H_atoms(C) + H_atoms(D)`\n        `H_atoms(A) + H_atoms(B) = (2n) + (2n - 6) = 4n - 6`.\n    *   A and B are unsaturated versions of Z (CnH2n). They are likely a cycloalkene (CnH(2n-2)) and a cycloalkadiene (CnH(2n-4)).\n    *   Let's check if this fits the hydrogen balance: `(2n - 2) + (2n - 4) = 4n - 6`. This is a perfect match.\n    *   So, mixture X consists of a cycloalkene (CnH(2n-2)) and a non-conjugated cycloalkadiene (CnH(2n-4)).\n\n5.  **Identify the Specific Compounds and Solve the Question**\n    *   We have two plausible scenarios depending on the value of n. The smallest possible value for n is 6, as benzene (C6H6) is the smallest neutral aromatic hydrocarbon.\n    *   **Case 1: n = 6**\n        *   Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12)\n        *   Y = {Cyclohexane (C6H12), Benzene (C6H6)}\n        *   A = Cyclohexene (C6H(2*6-2) = C6H10)\n        *   B = A non-conjugated cyclohexadiene, which is 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H(2*6-4) = C6H8).\n        *   This scenario fits all the conditions of the problem.\n    *   **Case 2: n = 7**\n        *   Z = Methylcyclohexane (C7H14)\n        *   Y = {Methylcyclohexane (C7H14), Toluene (C7H8)}\n        *   A = A methylcyclohexene (C7H12)\n        *   B = A non-conjugated methylcyclohexadiene (C7H10).\n        *   This scenario also fits all the conditions.\n\n6.  **Distinguishing Between the Cases**\n    *   We have two potential answers for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X:\n        *   Case 1 (n=6): H atoms = 10 (from C6H10) + 8 (from C6H8) = 18.\n        *   Case 2 (n=7): H atoms = 12 (from C7H12) + 10 (from C7H10) = 22.\n    *   Both 18 and 22 are given as options (C and B). Chemistry problems of this type usually have a single correct answer. The C6 system (cyclohexane/benzene) is the most fundamental and \"textbook\" example of this type of chemistry. In the absence of information that would invalidate it or point specifically to a higher homolog, the simplest case is the intended answer.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation**\n    *   Based on the most plausible C6 scenario:\n    *   Liquid 1 in X is cyclohexene, C6H10. It has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Liquid 2 in X is 1,4-cyclohexadiene, C6H8. It has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze Substance Z**\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon with the general formula CxHy.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%. Let's calculate the empirical formula.\n    *   Mass % of H = 14.28% = 0.1428\n    *   Mass % of C = 100% - 14.28% = 85.72%\n    *   Molar ratio C:H = (85.72 / 12.01) : (14.28 / 1.008) = 7.13 : 14.17 ≈ 1:2.\n*   The empirical formula is CH2.\n*   The molecular formula of a stable hydrocarbon with this ratio is CnH2n. This corresponds to the general formula for cycloalkanes or alkenes.\n*   The problem states that Z is formed by hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n*   The problem also states Z is a widely used solvent and a liquid.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction and Mixture Y**\n*   Mixture Y is formed from mixture X by heating with platinum. Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n*   Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated (alkanes, cycloalkanes) or aromatic.\n*   We know one component of Y is Z, the cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n*   The reaction from X to Y is a disproportionation, which in this context (Pt catalyst, formation of a saturated compound) implies a catalytic hydrogen transfer. One substance is hydrogenated (reduced) to Z, and another must be dehydrogenated (oxidized).\n*   For the resulting mixture Y to not decolorize bromine water, the dehydrogenated product must be stable and unreactive to Br2 water. The most common examples are aromatic compounds.\n*   Therefore, mixture Y consists of an equimolar mixture of a cycloalkane (Z, CnH2n) and an aromatic compound. The aromatic compound must have the same carbon skeleton as Z, which is formed upon its full hydrogenation.\n\n**3. Identify the Carbon Skeleton and the Components**\n*   The hydrogenation of *both* mixtures X and Y yields *only* substance Z. This is a crucial point that confirms all compounds in X and Y share the same carbon skeleton.\n*   Let's consider the most common example of this type of reaction, which involves a six-membered ring.\n    *   If n=6, Z is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. This fits the CnH2n formula, is a very common solvent, and is a liquid.\n    *   The corresponding aromatic compound with a C6 skeleton is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene does not decolorize bromine water.\n    *   Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **benzene (C6H6)** and **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n**4. Analyze Mixture X**\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n*   X decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C bonds).\n*   Hydrogenation of A and B must both yield Z (cyclohexane). This means A and B are unsaturated compounds with a C6H12 carbon skeleton. They are likely cyclohexene or a cyclohexadiene.\n*   The transformation from X to Y is a reaction where the components of X form the components of Y. Since Y is an equimolar mixture of benzene and cyclohexane, the reaction can be written as:\n    A + B → C6H6 + C6H12\n*   By the law of conservation of mass, the atoms must balance. Both A and B have 6 carbons, so the carbon atoms are balanced (6+6 → 6+6). Let the formula of A be C6Hx and B be C6Hy. The hydrogen atoms must also balance:\n    x + y = 6 + 12\n    x + y = 18\n*   This means the total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of compound A and one molecule of compound B is 18.\n*   Let's find plausible identities for A and B.\n    *   They are unsaturated cyclohexanes. A stable unsaturated cyclic C6 hydrocarbon can be cyclohexene (C6H10) or a cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   If A is C6H10 and B is C6H8, then the sum of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. This fits our deduction.\n    *   So, Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and a **cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n    *   The problem states there are *no conjugated multiple bonds* in the compounds of mixture X. Cyclohexene has one double bond, so no conjugation. For cyclohexadiene, there are two isomers: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated). Therefore, the diene must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene**.\n    *   Mixture X = {Cyclohexene, 1,4-Cyclohexadiene}. Both are liquids and will decolorize bromine water.\n\n**5. Final Verification**\n*   **X** = {C6H10, C6H8} (equimolar, liquids, unsaturated, non-conjugated). Check.\n*   **Reaction** X → Y: C6H10 + C6H8 --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 + C6H6. This is a hydrogen transfer reaction where cyclohexene is hydrogenated and 1,4-cyclohexadiene is dehydrogenated. It produces an equimolar mixture. Check.\n*   **Y** = {C6H12, C6H6} (equimolar, do not decolorize Br2 water). Check.\n*   **Z** = C6H12 (constituent of Y, widely used solvent, CnH2n, %H=14.28%). Check.\n*   **Hydrogenation of X**: C6H10 and C6H8 both hydrogenate to C6H12. Gives only Z. Check.\n*   **Hydrogenation of Y**: C6H6 and C6H12 both yield C6H12 under hydrogenation. Gives only Z. Check.\n\nThe logic is consistent. The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This corresponds to the sum of hydrogens in one molecule of each component.\n\nNumber of H atoms = (H in C6H10) + (H in C6H8) = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon, containing only carbon (C) and hydrogen (H).\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given as 14.28%. Let the formula be CₙHₘ.\n    *   The mass fraction of H is `(m * M_H) / (n * M_C + m * M_H)`, where M_H and M_C are the atomic masses of hydrogen and carbon, respectively.\n    *   Using integer atomic masses (H=1, C=12), the formula becomes `m / (12n + m) = 0.1428`.\n    *   Let's test the general formulas for hydrocarbons:\n        *   Alkanes (CₙH₂ₙ₊₂): H% = (2n+2) / (12n + 2n+2) = (2n+2) / (14n+2). For n=1, 4/16=25%. For large n, H% approaches 2/14 ≈ 14.3%.\n        *   Alkenes/Cycloalkanes (CₙH₂ₙ): H% = 2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857.\n        *   Alkynes (CₙH₂ₙ₋₂): H% will be lower.\n    *   The mass fraction 14.28% is very close to 1/7, which corresponds to the general formula CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   The problem states that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (\"does not react further with hydrogen\"). A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane).\n\n2.  **Relate all compounds via the carbon skeleton**\n    *   Hydrogenation of both mixture X (compounds A and B) and mixture Y (compounds C and D) gives *only* substance Z.\n    *   This is a crucial clue. It means that all four compounds A, B, C, and D, as well as Z itself, share the same carbon skeleton. When they are fully saturated with hydrogen, they all become Z.\n\n3.  **Identify Mixture Y and Z**\n    *   Mixture Y is formed by the disproportionation of mixture X over a heated platinum catalyst. It is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (C and D) that does not decolorize bromine water.\n    *   Disproportionation of cyclic unsaturated hydrocarbons over platinum (a reaction known as Zelinzky irreversible catalysis) typically involves hydrogen transfer, where some molecules are hydrogenated and others are dehydrogenated to form a stable aromatic system.\n    *   Substance Z is a cycloalkane (CₙH₂ₙ) and is a constituent of mixture Y. Let's say C = Z = CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   Since C is the hydrogenated product, its partner D must be the dehydrogenated product. The final, most stable dehydrogenated product of a cycloalkane skeleton is the corresponding aromatic compound.\n    *   Mixture Y = {a cycloalkane (Z), an aromatic compound}.\n    *   Let's consider the simplest and most common case, a 6-membered ring skeleton.\n        *   Z would be **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This fits the description of a widely used solvent with formula CₙH₂ₙ.\n        *   The corresponding aromatic compound is **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n        *   So, a very strong candidate for mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (Z) and benzene**.\n        *   Let's check: Y = {C₆H₁₂, C₆H₆}. Both are liquids. Neither decolorizes bromine water under normal conditions. This fits the description of Y perfectly. Hydrogenation of benzene gives cyclohexane, so hydrogenation of this mixture gives only cyclohexane (Z). This also fits.\n\n4.  **Identify Mixture X**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (A and B) that decolorizes bromine water (i.e., they are unsaturated) and has no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   The reaction `A + B --(Pt, heat)--> C + D` must be balanced. With Y = {cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + benzene (C₆H₆)}, the total formula of the products is C₁₂H₁₈. Therefore, the reactants A+B must also have the total formula C₁₂H₁₈.\n    *   A and B must have the same C₆ ring skeleton. We are looking for two different unsaturated C₆-ring compounds whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18.\n    *   Possible C₆ unsaturated ring compounds (non-conjugated):\n        *   **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)**: one double bond.\n        *   **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**: two isolated double bonds (1,3-cyclohexadiene is conjugated and thus excluded).\n    *   Let's check the sum of their hydrogen atoms: 10 + 8 = 18. This matches exactly.\n    *   Therefore, mixture X is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   The disproportionation reaction is:\n        C₆H₈ (1,4-cyclohexadiene) + C₆H₁₀ (cyclohexene) → C₆H₆ (benzene) + C₆H₁₂ (cyclohexane)\n        In this hydrogen transfer, the diene loses 2H to become benzene, and the monoene gains those 2H to become cyclohexane. This reaction produces an equimolar mixture Y.\n\n5.  **Verify all conditions**\n    *   X = {C₆H₁₀, C₆H₈}. Equimolar mixture of two liquids. Both have C=C bonds, so they decolorize Br₂ water. 1,4-CHD has no conjugated bonds. ✓\n    *   Y = {C₆H₁₂, C₆H₆}. Equimolar mixture formed from X. Both are liquids that do not decolorize Br₂ water. ✓\n    *   Z = C₆H₁₂. Has H% of 14.3%, is a constituent of Y, is a widely used solvent, is saturated. ✓\n    *   Hydrogenation of X ({C₆H₁₀, C₆H₈}) gives only C₆H₁₂. ✓\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y ({C₆H₁₂, C₆H₆}) gives only C₆H₁₂. ✓\n    *   All conditions are satisfied by this C₆-based system. An analogous C₇-based system {methylcyclohexene, methylcyclohexadiene} is also possible and would lead to an answer of 22, but the cyclohexane/benzene system is the most fundamental and classic example of this type of reaction.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Answer**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   The two liquids are cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n    *   Number of H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexene = 10.\n    *   Number of H atoms in one molecule of 1,4-cyclohexadiene = 8.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   Let the formula of Z be CnHm. The mass fraction of hydrogen is approximately `m / (12n + m)`.\n    *   `14.28%` is equivalent to `0.1428`, which is very close to the fraction `1/7`.\n    *   Let's test this: `m / (12n + m) = 1/7` => `7m = 12n + m` => `6m = 12n` => `m = 2n`.\n    *   So, the general formula for Z is CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (it does not react further with hydrogen). A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem also states that Z is \"widely used as a solvent\". Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclopentane (C5H10), cyclohexane (C6H12), and methylcyclohexane (C7H14). All of these fit the CnH2n formula.\n    *   The crucial clue is that hydrogenation of both mixtures X and Y gives *only one* substance, Z. This means that all reactive components in both mixtures must share the same carbon skeleton, which upon saturation, yields Z.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n    *   It \"does not decolorize bromine water\", which typically means it contains saturated compounds (alkanes or cycloalkanes) and is not aromatic, or at least does not contain simple alkenes/alkynes.\n    *   Substance Z is a constituent of mixture Y. So, one component of Y is Z, the cycloalkane CnH2n.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z. If Y consists of `Y1` and `Y2`, and `Y1 = Z`, then hydrogenation of `Y2` must also yield Z.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Disproportionation Reaction (X → Y)**\n    *   Mixture X is transformed into mixture Y upon heating with a platinum catalyst. This is described as a disproportionation.\n    *   A disproportionation reaction in organic chemistry is typically a redox reaction where a substance is simultaneously oxidized (loses hydrogen or gains oxygen) and reduced (gains hydrogen or loses oxygen). For hydrocarbons, this usually means hydrogen transfer.\n    *   So, some component(s) in X are reduced, and some are oxidized to form the components of Y.\n    *   Let the two components of X be `X1 (CnH_a)` and `X2 (CnH_b)`.\n    *   Let the two components of Y be `Y1 (CnH_c)` and `Y2 (CnH_d)`.\n    *   Since X and Y are both equimolar mixtures, the overall reaction stoichiometry is likely `X1 + X2 → Y1 + Y2`.\n    *   By the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms must be the same on both sides. `C(2n)H(a+b) → C(2n)H(c+d)`. This means `a + b = c + d`.\n\n4.  **Revisiting Mixture Y and a Key Interpretation**\n    *   Initially, one might assume that because Y is \"saturated,\" both components must be cycloalkanes (e.g., Y1=cyclohexane, Y2=methylcyclopentane). This would mean `c=d=2n`. This leads to `a+b = 4n`.\n    *   However, mixture X \"decolorizes bromine water\", meaning its components are unsaturated. Thus, `a < 2n` and `b < 2n`. This leads to a contradiction: `a+b` must be less than `4n`.\n    *   This contradiction suggests a flaw in the interpretation. The key lies in the phrase \"does not decolorize bromine water\". While this strictly means saturated, in the context of many chemistry problems, it's used to distinguish reactive alkenes/alkynes from the less reactive aromatic compounds. Benzene does not react with bromine water under normal conditions (it requires a Lewis acid catalyst). Let's test the hypothesis that one of the products in Y is aromatic.\n    *   Let's assume the reaction is a classic hydrogen transfer producing a cycloalkane and an aromatic ring.\n    *   Let `Y1 = Z = CnH2n` (a cycloalkane).\n    *   Let `Y2` be the corresponding aromatic compound, `Cn H(n)` (e.g., if n=6, benzene C6H6). This fits the `m=n` for typical aromatic rings like benzene, though more accurately `C6H6` hydrogenates to `C6H12`. Let's test with `n=6`, which is the most common for these reactions.\n    *   So let's hypothesize: `Z = cyclohexane (C6H12)`.\n    *   And `Y = {cyclohexane (C6H12), benzene (C6H6)}`.\n    *   Let's check if this Y fits the description:\n        *   Equimolar mixture of two liquids: Yes.\n        *   \"Does not decolorize bromine water\": Plausible under this interpretation.\n        *   Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z: Hydrogenation of cyclohexane gives cyclohexane. Hydrogenation of benzene gives cyclohexane. Yes, this works.\n        *   Z is a constituent of Y: Yes, cyclohexane is present.\n\n5.  **Determine the Composition of Mixture X**\n    *   If `Y = {cyclohexane (C6H12), benzene (C6H6)}`, the total formula of the products (`Y1+Y2`) is `C12H18`.\n    *   Therefore, the total formula of the reactants (`X1+X2`) must also be `C12H18`.\n    *   So, for `X1 (C6Ha)` and `X2 (C6Hb)`, we must have `a + b = 18`.\n    *   Now we need to find two different liquids, X1 and X2, that fit the remaining conditions:\n        *   They must be C6 compounds.\n        *   They must be unsaturated (decolorize Br2 water).\n        *   They must not contain conjugated multiple bonds.\n        *   They must both hydrogenate to give only cyclohexane.\n    *   Let's choose a pair of molecules with `a+b=18`. A good candidate pair is one with 10 hydrogens and one with 8 hydrogens.\n        *   **X1 = C6H10**: A C6 alkene. **Cyclohexene** fits perfectly. It is a liquid, unsaturated, not conjugated, and its hydrogenation product is cyclohexane.\n        *   **X2 = C6H8**: A C6 diene. To satisfy the \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" rule, we can't use cyclohexa-1,3-diene. However, **cyclohexa-1,4-diene** fits perfectly. It is a liquid, unsaturated, non-conjugated, and its hydrogenation product is cyclohexane.\n    *   So, a viable composition for mixture X is `{cyclohexene, cyclohexa-1,4-diene}`.\n\n6.  **Verify the Reaction**\n    *   The proposed transformation is:\n        `C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (cyclohexa-1,4-diene) --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)`\n    *   This reaction is a plausible intermolecular hydrogen transfer (disproportionation). The cyclohexene is reduced to cyclohexane, and the cyclohexa-1,4-diene is oxidized to benzene.\n    *   All conditions of the problem are satisfied with this model.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Answer**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   The two liquids are cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8).\n    *   Total H atoms = 10 (from C6H10) + 8 (from C6H8) = 18.\n\nFinal Answer Check: The options are A) 16, B) 12, C) 22, D) 18. Our calculated value is 18, which matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%. Let's determine the empirical formula of Z (CxHy).\n        The mass fraction of H is given by: `mass%(H) = (y * Ar(H)) / (x * Ar(C) + y * Ar(H))`.\n        Using approximate atomic masses (C=12, H=1), we get: `0.1428 ≈ y / (12x + y)`.\n        This fraction is very close to 1/7 (`1/7 ≈ 0.142857`).\n        So, `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`\n        `7y = 12x + y`\n        `6y = 12x`\n        `y = 2x`\n    *   The empirical formula is CH2. The general molecular formula is (CH2)n, or CnH2n.\n    *   This formula corresponds to either an alkene (C=C bond) or a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z is a product of hydrogenation under severe conditions and \"does not react further with hydrogen\". This means Z is a saturated hydrocarbon.\n    *   Therefore, Z must be a **cycloalkane** with the formula **CnH2n**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n    *   It \"does not decolorize bromine water\". This means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   One component of Y is Z itself, which is a saturated cycloalkane (CnH2n). Let's call this Y1. So, Y1 = Z = CnH2n.\n    *   Mixture Y is formed from mixture X by \"disproportionation\" using a platinum catalyst and heat. Disproportionation is a redox reaction. In hydrocarbon chemistry, this often involves hydrogen transfer, where one molecule is hydrogenated (reduced) and another is dehydrogenated (oxidized).\n    *   The hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only substance Z. This means the other component of Y (let's call it Y2) must also have the same carbon skeleton as Z. Upon hydrogenation, Y2 becomes Z.\n    *   Since Y2 has the same carbon skeleton (a C-n ring) and must be formed by dehydrogenation, it is most likely an aromatic compound. The formula for a simple aromatic compound derived from a CnH2n cycloalkane is **CnH2n-6**. For example, cyclohexane (C6H12) is related to benzene (C6H6). Methylcyclohexane (C7H14) is related to toluene (methylbenzene, C7H8). Aromatic compounds like benzene and toluene do not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions.\n    *   So, Mixture Y consists of **CnH2n** (Z) and **CnH2n-6** in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Reaction**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them X1 and X2.\n    *   X \"decolorizes bromine water\", meaning its components have C=C double bonds. They are unsaturated.\n    *   Hydrogenation of X gives only Z (CnH2n). This confirms that X1 and X2 also have the same CnH- carbon skeleton as Z. They are therefore cycloalkenes or cycloalkadienes.\n    *   The problem states \"There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X\". This gives a specific structural constraint.\n    *   The reaction `Mixture X -> Mixture Y` is a 1:1 molar reaction, as an *equimolar* mixture X forms an *equimolar* mixture Y. This implies the stoichiometry is `X1 + X2 -> Y1 + Y2`.\n        `X1 + X2 -> CnH2n + CnH2n-6`\n    *   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component of X is reduced to CnH2n, while the other is oxidized to CnH2n-6. For this to work, X1 must be more hydrogenated than Y2 (the aromatic) and X2 must be more hydrogenated than Y2. Also, X1 must be less hydrogenated than Y1 (the cycloalkane). The most logical combination for X1 and X2, which are non-conjugated and have a CnH- skeleton, is a cycloalkene (**CnH2n-2**) and a non-conjugated cycloalkadiene (**CnH2n-4**).\n\n4.  **Balance the Reaction and Find the Solution**\n    *   Let's check if this combination works:\n        `X1 (CnH2n-4) + X2 (CnH2n-2) -> Y1 (CnH2n) + Y2 (CnH2n-6)` (The order of X1, X2 is arbitrary).\n        This does not balance.\n    *   Let's rethink the hydrogen transfer. The overall process must be balanced. Let the hydrogen counts in X1 and X2 be `a` and `b`. The reaction is:\n        `CnH_a + CnH_b -> CnH2n + CnH2n-6`\n        The hydrogen atoms must balance: `a + b = 2n + (2n - 6) = 4n - 6`.\n    *   The question asks for \"the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X\", which corresponds to `a + b`. So we need to find the value of `4n - 6`.\n    *   We have to determine 'n'. The problem mentions Z is \"widely used as a solvent\". Both cyclohexane (n=6) and methylcyclohexane (n=7) fit this description and the CnH2n formula with H% ≈ 14.3%. The reaction scheme is plausible for both. In the absence of further information, the most fundamental and simplest example is usually intended. The C6 system (cyclohexane/benzene) is the parent system for this type of chemistry. Let's assume **n=6**.\n        *   Z = Cyclohexane, C6H12\n        *   Y = Equimolar mixture of Cyclohexane (C6H12) and Benzene (C6H6).\n        *   X must be an equimolar mixture of C6 compounds that can react to form Y. Based on our model:\n            *   `X1` would be a cyclohexadiene, C6H8. To be non-conjugated, it must be **cyclohexa-1,4-diene**.\n            *   `X2` would be a cyclohexene, C6H10. The only one is **cyclohexene**.\n        *   The reaction is: `C6H8 + C6H10 -> C6H6 + C6H12`. This is a balanced hydrogen transfer.\n        *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each of the two liquids in mixture X is the sum of hydrogens in C6H8 and C6H10.\n        *   Total H atoms = 8 + 10 = 18.\n\n    *   Alternatively, using the formula `4n - 6`:\n        For n=6, Total H = 4(6) - 6 = 24 - 6 = 18.\n\n5.  **Check the Options**\n    *   The calculated value is 18.\n    *   The given options are A) 18, B) 22, C) 16, D) 12.\n    *   Our result matches option A.\n\n    (Note: If we had chosen n=7, the total H atoms would be 4(7) - 6 = 22, which is option B. However, the C6 system is the most classic and fundamental example for this type of problem.)\n\nThe final answer is the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two molecules of mixture X. This is 18.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n    *   The mass fraction is calculated as `(mass of H) / (total mass)`. Let's use atomic masses C ≈ 12 and H ≈ 1.\n    *   For a general hydrocarbon `CnHm`, the mass fraction of H is `m / (12n + m)`.\n    *   Let's test the given percentage: 14.28% is approximately equal to the fraction 1/7.\n    *   Let's see which hydrocarbon formula class fits `m / (12n + m) = 1/7`.\n    *   Cross-multiplying gives `7m = 12n + m`, which simplifies to `6m = 12n`, or `m = 2n`.\n    *   The general formula `CnH2n` corresponds to either an alkene (with one double bond) or a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z is formed by hydrogenating other substances and that Z itself \"does not react further with hydrogen.\" This means Z must be a saturated compound. An alkene is unsaturated, while a cycloalkane is saturated.\n    *   Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane with the formula `CnH2n`.\n    *   Z is also described as a \"widely used as a solvent.\" Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclopentane (C5H10) and cyclohexane (C6H12).\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n    *   Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids formed from the disproportionation of X.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water, which means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only one substance, Z.\n    *   Z itself is one of the components of Y.\n    *   Let the two components of Y be Y1 and Y2. We can set `Y1 = Z = CnH2n` (the cycloalkane).\n    *   The other component, Y2, must also hydrogenate to Z (`CnH2n`). This means Y2 must have the same carbon skeleton (n carbon atoms in a ring).\n    *   Since Y2 does not decolorize bromine water, but can be hydrogenated, it must be an aromatic compound. The hydrogenation of aromatic rings requires severe conditions, which matches the problem description.\n    *   The most common and stable aromatic ring structure is benzene (C6H6). If Y2 is benzene, then n=6.\n    *   This implies that `Z = C6H12` (cyclohexane) and `Y2 = C6H6` (benzene).\n    *   This is a very plausible scenario: Z=cyclohexane is a widely used solvent, and its hydrogenation gives itself. Y2=benzene does not decolorize bromine water and its hydrogenation under severe conditions gives cyclohexane.\n    *   So, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6).\n\n3.  **Relate Mixture X to Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2.\n    *   When heated with platinum, X undergoes disproportionation to form the equimolar mixture Y. A disproportionation is a redox reaction where a species is simultaneously oxidized and reduced. In this context (Pt catalyst), it's a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component is dehydrogenated (oxidized) and another is hydrogenated (reduced).\n    *   The reaction is: `X1 + X2 -> Y1 + Y2`.\n    *   Since X and Y are equimolar mixtures, the stoichiometry is `1 molecule of X1 + 1 molecule of X2 -> 1 molecule of Y1 + 1 molecule of Y2`.\n    *   Substituting the components of Y we identified: `X1 + X2 -> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)`.\n\n4.  **Determine the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms in X**\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This confirms that both X1 and X2 have the same C6-ring carbon skeleton as cyclohexane. So their formulas are `C6Hx` and `C6Hy`.\n    *   Based on the principle of conservation of mass for the disproportionation reaction, the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the equation.\n    *   Looking at the hydrogen atoms: `(Number of H in X1) + (Number of H in X2) = (Number of H in C6H12) + (Number of H in C6H6)`.\n    *   Total H in X = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   The question asks for the \"total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X\", which corresponds to this sum.\n\n5.  **Verification (Optional but recommended)**\n    *   Let's check if we can find plausible structures for X1 and X2.\n    *   `X1 = C6Hx`, `X2 = C6Hy`, with `x+y=18`.\n    *   Both must decolorize bromine water, meaning they are unsaturated (contain C=C bonds).\n    *   They must not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   Possible unsaturated C6-ring compounds are cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexadienes (C6H8).\n    *   Let's try `X1 = Cyclohexene (C6H10)` and `X2 = Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)`.\n        *   Does x+y=18? Yes, 10 + 8 = 18.\n        *   Does cyclohexene decolorize bromine water? Yes.\n        *   Does cyclohexa-1,4-diene decolorize bromine water? Yes.\n        *   Does it have conjugated bonds? No, the double bonds at positions 1 and 4 are isolated. (Cyclohexa-1,3-diene has conjugated bonds and is excluded by the problem statement).\n        *   The reaction `C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (cyclohexa-1,4-diene) -> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)` is a balanced hydrogen transfer reaction. Cyclohexene is dehydrogenated to benzene, and the diene is hydrogenated to cyclohexane. This is chemically reasonable over a Pt catalyst.\n    *   This successful identification of X1 and X2 confirms our stoichiometric calculation.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each of the two liquids in mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance Z**\n\n1.  Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n    The mass fraction of hydrogen in a hydrocarbon CnHm is given by `m / (12n + m)`.\n    `m / (12n + m) = 0.1428`\n    This value is very close to 1/7 (`1/7 ≈ 0.142857`).\n    `m / (12n + m) = 1/7`\n    `7m = 12n + m`\n    `6m = 12n`\n    `m = 2n`\n    So, the general formula for Z is `CnH2n`.\n\n2.  Z is formed by the hydrogenation of other compounds (from mixtures X and Y) and does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a saturated hydrocarbon.\n\n3.  The general formula for a saturated acyclic hydrocarbon (alkane) is `CnH(2n+2)`. The general formula for a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon (cycloalkane) is `CnH2n`.\n\n4.  Since the formula for Z is `CnH2n` and it is saturated, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n\n5.  Z is also described as a widely used solvent. A very common cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. Let's assume Z is cyclohexane. The carbon skeleton of all compounds involved must therefore be a six-membered ring.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Mixture Y**\n\n1.  Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that is formed from mixture X.\n2.  Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated (like alkanes/cycloalkanes) or aromatic. They cannot be alkenes or alkynes.\n3.  Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only one substance, Z (cyclohexane).\n4.  One component of Y is Z itself (cyclohexane, C6H12), as stated in the problem.\n5.  The other component of Y must also hydrogenate to form cyclohexane. For it to not be an alkene but still react with hydrogen under severe conditions, it must be an aromatic compound. The only aromatic compound with a 6-carbon skeleton is **benzene (C6H6)**.\n6.  The hydrogenation of benzene produces cyclohexane: `C6H6 + 3H2 -> C6H12`.\n7.  Thus, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **benzene (C6H6)** and **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. This fits the description, as neither readily decolorizes bromine water, and hydrogenating the mixture (hydrogenating the benzene and leaving the cyclohexane unreacted) yields pure cyclohexane.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Mixture X and the Reaction**\n\n1.  Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water, meaning at least one (and likely both, based on the phrasing) of its components is an alkene.\n2.  The components of X do not have conjugated multiple bonds. This rules out 1,3-cyclohexadiene.\n3.  The hydrogenation of mixture X gives only cyclohexane (Z), so both components of X must be C6 cyclic compounds that can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane.\n4.  The reaction from X to Y is described as a disproportionation. In this context, it means a hydrogen transfer reaction where one component is oxidized (loses hydrogen) and another is reduced (gains hydrogen).\n    `Mixture X (A+B) --(Pt, heat)--> Mixture Y (Benzene + Cyclohexane)`\n5.  We need to find two C6 cyclic alkenes (A and B) that can react in a 1:1 molar ratio to produce benzene and cyclohexane in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n    Let A be oxidized to benzene (C6H6).\n    Let B be reduced to cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    The reaction would be a hydrogen transfer: `A + B -> C6H6 + C6H12`.\n6.  For the atom count to balance, the total atoms in `A + B` must equal the total atoms in `C6H6 + C6H12` (which is C12H18).\n7.  The logical candidates for A and B (non-conjugated C6 cyclic alkenes) are **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n8.  Let's check if they fit the reaction:\n    `C6H8 + C6H10 -> C6H6 + C6H12`\n    Reactants: C: 6+6=12, H: 8+10=18 -> C12H18\n    Products: C: 6+6=12, H: 6+12=18 -> C12H18\n    The stoichiometry is balanced.\n9.  In this reaction, 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) is oxidized to benzene (C6H6) by losing two hydrogen atoms. Cyclohexene (C6H10) is reduced to cyclohexane (C6H12) by gaining two hydrogen atoms. This is a plausible catalytic hydrogen transfer.\n10. So, Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)** and **cyclohexene (C6H10)**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of the hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n-   Component 1: Cyclohexene (C6H10) has **10** hydrogen atoms.\n-   Component 2: 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) has **8** hydrogen atoms.\n\nTotal number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon, so its formula is CxHy.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is given as 14.28%, which is equivalent to 0.1428.\n    *   The mass fraction of H can be calculated as `Mass_H / Total_Mass = (y * 1.008) / (x * 12.011 + y * 1.008)`. For simplicity, using integer masses (H=1, C=12), the formula is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   `y / (12x + y) = 0.1428`\n    *   Let's test the general formulas for hydrocarbons:\n        *   **Alkanes (CnH2n+2):** %H = (2n+2) / (12n + 2n+2) = (2n+2) / (14n+2). As n increases, this value approaches 2/14 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%. For n=6 (hexane, C6H14), %H = 14 / (14*6+2) = 14/86 ≈ 16.3%. This is not a match.\n        *   **Cycloalkanes (CnH2n):** %H = 2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 2/14 = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857. This is a perfect match.\n    *   So, Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states Z is widely used as a solvent. Common cycloalkane solvents are cyclopentane (C5H10) and cyclohexane (C6H12). We'll see which one fits the other clues.\n    *   Z does not react further with hydrogen, which is consistent with it being a saturated cycloalkane.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n    *   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated (alkanes, cycloalkanes) or aromatic.\n    *   One constituent of Y is the substance Z. So, one liquid in Y is Z (a cycloalkane).\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives *only* substance Z. This means the second component of Y, let's call it Y₂, must also convert to Z upon hydrogenation.\n    *   If Y₂ hydrogenates to a cycloalkane Z, it must have the same carbon skeleton as Z and be either unsaturated or aromatic. Since Y₂ does not decolorize bromine water, it must be aromatic.\n    *   For an aromatic compound (Y₂) and a cycloalkane (Z) to have the same carbon skeleton that can be interconverted by hydrogenation, the skeleton must be a six-membered ring. This forces Z to be **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and Y₂ to be **benzene (C6H6)**.\n    *   Let's check this: Cyclohexane is a common solvent. Hydrogenation of benzene gives cyclohexane. Benzene does not react with bromine water without a catalyst. This all fits.\n    *   Therefore, mixture Y consists of equimolar amounts of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Disproportionation Reaction**\n\n    *   The reaction is `Mixture X → Mixture Y` upon heating with Pt.\n    *   This means: `(Components of X) --(Pt, heat)--> Benzene (C6H6) + Cyclohexane (C6H12)` (in a 1:1 molar ratio).\n    *   This is a disproportionation reaction, which in this context means a hydrogen transfer reaction. One species is dehydrogenated (loses hydrogen, gets \"oxidized\") and another is hydrogenated (gains hydrogen, gets \"reduced\").\n    *   Benzene (C6H6) is the oxidized product (less H than the starting materials).\n    *   Cyclohexane (C6H12) is the reduced product (more H than the starting materials).\n    *   Since mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (let's call them X₁ and X₂), and the products are also formed in an equimolar ratio, the simplest reaction stoichiometry is: `X₁ + X₂ → Benzene + Cyclohexane`.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This implies that both X₁ and X₂ have a six-carbon skeleton that hydrogenates to cyclohexane's skeleton. So, they must be of the formula C6Hy.\n    *   Our reaction becomes: `C6Hx + C6Hy → C6H6 + C6H12`.\n    *   By conservation of atoms, we can balance the hydrogens: `x + y = 6 + 12 = 18`.\n\n4.  **Identify the Components of Mixture X**\n\n    *   We need to find two compounds, X₁ (C6Hx) and X₂ (C6Hy), such that `x + y = 18`.\n    *   Properties of X₁ and X₂:\n        *   They are based on a 6-membered ring skeleton.\n        *   They decolorize bromine water, so they must contain C=C double bonds (i.e., they are cycloalkenes or cycloalkadienes).\n        *   They do not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   Let's look for possible candidates:\n        *   **Cyclohexene (C6H10):** Contains one double bond, so it decolorizes bromine water. The double bond is not conjugated. This is a possible candidate. Here, the number of hydrogens is 10.\n        *   **Cyclohexadienes (C6H8):** Contain two double bonds.\n            *   1,3-Cyclohexadiene: The double bonds are conjugated. The problem states there are no conjugated bonds, so this is ruled out.\n            *   **1,4-Cyclohexadiene:** The double bonds are not conjugated. This is a possible candidate. Here, the number of hydrogens is 8.\n    *   Let's test the combination of X₁ = Cyclohexene (C6H10) and X₂ = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   The number of hydrogen atoms are x=10 and y=8. Let's check our hydrogen balance: `x + y = 10 + 8 = 18`. This is a perfect match.\n    *   The disproportionation reaction would be:\n        `C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) + C6H10 (cyclohexene) --(Pt, heat)--> C6H6 (benzene) + C6H12 (cyclohexane)`\n        In this reaction, the 1,4-cyclohexadiene is oxidized (loses 2H) to benzene, and the cyclohexene is reduced (gains 2H) to cyclohexane. This is a chemically sound hydrogen transfer reaction.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer**\n\n    *   The two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in C6H10) + (H atoms in C6H8)\n    *   Total H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon, and the mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula: `(mass of H) / (total mass of molecule)`.\n*   Let's consider the general formula for saturated hydrocarbons.\n    *   For an alkane, CnH2n+2: Mass % H = `(2n + 2) * 1 / (12n + 2n + 2)` = `(2n + 2) / (14n + 2)`. Setting this to 0.1428 (or 1/7) does not yield an integer solution for n.\n    *   For a cycloalkane, CnH2n: Mass % H = `(2n) * 1 / (12n + 2n)` = `2n / 14n` = `2/14` = `1/7`.\n*   1/7 is approximately 0.142857, which matches the given 14.28%. Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane with the general formula CnH2n.\n*   The problem states that Z is widely used as a solvent. Common cycloalkane solvents are cyclopentane (C5H10) and cyclohexane (C6H12).\n*   The entire reaction chemistry described points towards a six-carbon ring system (as will be shown below), making **cyclohexane (C6H12)** the most logical identity for Z.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the components of mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, C and D.\n*   Y does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic. Benzene (aromatic) and saturated cycloalkanes do not react with bromine water under these conditions.\n*   Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n*   Z (cyclohexane) is itself a constituent of mixture Y. Let's say **D = Z = cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n*   The other component, C, must also be hydrogenated to Z (cyclohexane).\n*   The reaction that forms Y from X is a disproportionation over heated platinum. For a C6-ring system, this type of reaction typically involves dehydrogenation to form the stable aromatic compound, benzene, and hydrogenation of other molecules.\n*   Let's propose that the other component C is **benzene (C6H6)**.\n*   Let's check if Y = {benzene, cyclohexane} fits the criteria:\n    *   **Equimolar mixture of two liquids:** Benzene and cyclohexane are liquids and can form an equimolar mixture. Correct.\n    *   **Does not decolorize bromine water:** Correct.\n    *   **Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z:** Hydrogenation of benzene gives cyclohexane. Hydrogenation of cyclohexane gives cyclohexane. So, the mixture hydrogenates to give only cyclohexane (Z). Correct.\n    *   **Z is a constituent of Y:** Correct, cyclohexane is in the mixture.\n*   So, we conclude that **Y is an equimolar mixture of benzene (C6H6) and cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the components of mixture X**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B.\n*   X decolorizes bromine water, so A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds).\n*   The reaction X → Y is a disproportionation that produces an equimolar mixture of benzene and cyclohexane.\n    `A + B → C6H6 + C6H12`\n    (starting with 1 mole of A and 1 mole of B gives 1 mole of benzene and 1 mole of cyclohexane).\n*   By conservation of atoms, the total formula of A + B must be `C12H18`.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means both A and B must have a six-carbon skeleton that can be hydrogenated to a cyclohexane ring. Therefore, A and B are C6 compounds.\n*   Since A and B are C6 compounds and their combined formula is C12H18, they must have formulas C6Hx and C6Hy, where `x + y = 18`.\n*   A and B are unsaturated C6-ring compounds (isomers of cyclohexene or cyclohexadiene).\n    *   Cyclohexane (saturated) is C6H12.\n    *   Cyclohexene (one C=C bond) is C6H10.\n    *   Cyclohexadiene (two C=C bonds) is C6H8.\n*   We need to find two of these formulas whose hydrogen counts sum to 18. The only possible combination is 10 and 8.\n    *   Thus, one component of X is **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and the other is **cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n*   This combination makes sense in the disproportionation reaction:\n    `C6H8 (cyclohexadiene) → C6H6 (benzene) + 2H` (oxidation)\n    `C6H10 (cyclohexene) + 2H → C6H12 (cyclohexane)` (reduction)\n    This is a balanced hydrogen transfer between the two components of mixture X.\n*   Finally, the problem states that there are **no conjugated multiple bonds** in the compounds of mixture X.\n    *   Cyclohexene has only one double bond, so no conjugation.\n    *   For cyclohexadiene (C6H8), there are two isomers: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated).\n    *   Therefore, the specific diene must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene**.\n*   So, **X is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total number of hydrogen atoms**\n\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.

The mass fraction of hydrogen is approximately `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   `y / (12x + y) = 0.1428`.\n    *   14.28% is very close to 1/7. `1/7 ≈ 0.142857`.\n    *   So, `y / (12x + y) = 1/7` => `7y = 12x + y` => `6y = 12x` => `y = 2x`.\n    *   The empirical formula of Z is CH2. The general formula is CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (it does not react further with hydrogen). The formula CnH2n corresponds to either an alkene or a cycloalkane. Since it's saturated, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane (C6H12). This fits the formula CnH2n with n=6. Let's assume Z is cyclohexane.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Hydrogenation Reaction:**\n    *   The problem states that hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y under severe conditions gives *only one substance*, which is Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   This is a crucial clue. It means that all the component molecules in both mixture X and mixture Y have the same carbon skeleton, which is a six-membered ring. If they had different skeletons (e.g., a five-membered ring with a methyl group), hydrogenation would likely produce different products or a mixture.\n\n3.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n    *   It does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated (or aromatic, which are resistant to this reaction).\n    *   Mixture Y is formed by the disproportionation of mixture X over heated platinum.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y gives only cyclohexane (Z).\n    *   Z (cyclohexane, C6H12) is a constituent of mixture Y.\n    *   Let the components of Y be Y1 and Y2. We know Y1 = Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    *   What is Y2? It must be a C6 compound that can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane. It must not decolorize bromine water. A well-known reaction that fits the description of \"disproportionation over platinum\" is the dehydrogenation/hydrogenation of cycloalkenes. A common example is the disproportionation of cyclohexene to cyclohexane and benzene.\n        `3 C6H10 (cyclohexene) --(Pt)--> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + 2 C6H6 (benzene)`\n    *   This suggests that the products in Y could be cyclohexane and benzene. Let's check if this fits the criteria for Y2 = Benzene (C6H6).\n        *   Hydrogenation: Benzene + 3H2 -> Cyclohexane. This works.\n        *   Decolorizes bromine water: Benzene does *not* decolorize aqueous bromine water under normal conditions, unlike alkenes. This fits.\n    *   So, we can confidently identify mixture Y as an equimolar mixture of **Cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **Benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n4.  **Identify the Components of Mixture X:**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2.\n    *   X is converted to Y via a catalytic process (heated Pt). This process is a disproportionation, which in this context means a hydrogen transfer reaction.

A hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n that is saturated must be a cycloalkane. Acyclic alkanes have the formula CnH2n+2.\nSo, Z is a cycloalkane.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Z and the components of mixture Y.**\nZ is a cycloalkane (CnH2n) and is widely used as a solvent. Common cycloalkane solvents are cyclopentane (C5H10) and cyclohexane (C6H12). Both fit the formula CnH2n. The C6 ring system is very common in these types of reactions. Let's hypothesize that Z is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\nMixture Y is formed by the disproportionation of mixture X. Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, does not decolorize bromine water, and one of its components is Z (cyclohexane). Let mixture Y be {Z, D}.\nSince Y is a product of disproportionation, one component should be a \"reduced\" product and the other an \"oxidized\" product (in terms of hydrogen content).\n*   Z (cyclohexane, C6H12) is the reduced product.\n*   The other component, D, must be the oxidized (dehydrogenated) product. It must also have a C6 skeleton, as hydrogenation of Y gives only Z. It must not decolorize bromine water.\nThe most stable dehydrogenation product of a C6 cyclic system is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene is aromatically stable and does not react with bromine water.\nSo, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\nLet's check the hydrogenation condition for Y:\n*   Hydrogenation of cyclohexane (C6H12) yields cyclohexane (Z).\n*   Hydrogenation of benzene (C6H6) requires severe conditions (which is mentioned in the problem) and yields cyclohexane (Z): C6H6 + 3H2 → C6H12.\nThis confirms our identification of mixture Y = {cyclohexane, benzene} and Z = cyclohexane.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the components of mixture X.**\nMixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B. The reaction is:\nA + B → Y (equimolar mixture of C6H12 and C6H6)\nSo, the reaction is:\nA + B → C6H12 + C6H6\n\nWe are told that hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means:\n*   A + H2 → C6H12\n*   B + H2 → C6H12\nThis implies that both A and B are C6 hydrocarbons with a carbon skeleton that can be hydrogenated to that of cyclohexane.\nFrom the reaction stoichiometry A + B → C6H12 + C6H6, we can balance the atoms. Since A and B are both C6 hydrocarbons, let their formulas be C6Hx and C6Hy.\nC6Hx + C6Hy → C6H12 + C6H6\nBalancing hydrogen atoms: x + y = 12 + 6 = 18.\n\nSo, mixture X consists of two C6 hydrocarbons, C6Hx and C6Hy, where x + y = 18.\nThe problem also gives two crucial constraints for mixture X:\n1.  It decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds). This implies x < 12 and y < 12 (since C6H12 is the saturated cycloalkane).\n2.  There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules.\n\nWe need to find two even integers x and y such that x + y = 18 and x, y < 12. The only reasonable pair is x = 10 and y = 8.\nSo, the components of mixture X are A = C6H10 and B = C6H8.\n\nLet's find plausible structures:\n*   **A = C6H10**: A cycloalkene with a C6 ring. The simplest choice is **cyclohexene**. It has one double bond (decolorizes Br2 water) and no conjugated bonds. Hydrogenation gives cyclohexane. This fits perfectly.\n*   **B = C6H8**: A cycloalkadiene with a C6 ring. We need a non-conjugated isomer. Cyclohexa-1,3-diene is conjugated, so it is ruled out. **Cyclohexa-1,4-diene** has two isolated double bonds, so it is not conjugated. It decolorizes Br2 water and its hydrogenation gives cyclohexane. This fits perfectly.\n\nThe reaction is a hydrogen transfer:\nC6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (cyclohexa-1,4-diene) --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)\nIn this disproportionation, the cyclohexa-1,4-diene gives up hydrogen (is oxidized) to become benzene, and the cyclohexene accepts that hydrogen (is reduced) to become cyclohexane. This process explains how an equimolar mixture of reactants produces an equimolar mixture of products. All conditions are satisfied.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final answer.**\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of liquid A and one molecule of liquid B.\n*   Liquid A has the formula C6H10, so it has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n*   Liquid B has the formula C6H8, so it has 8 hydrogen atoms.\nTotal number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze and Identify Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon, a product of hydrogenation of other hydrocarbons (from mixtures X and Y).\n    *   Z does not react further with hydrogen, which means it is a saturated hydrocarbon (an alkane or a cycloalkane).\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is given as 14.28%.\n    *   Let's analyze this percentage. 14.28% is numerically very close to 1/7 (1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857).\n    *   Let's determine the general formula of a hydrocarbon where the mass ratio of C to H is 6:1 (since the H mass fraction is 1/7, the C mass fraction must be 6/7). Using integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1), the ratio of the number of atoms (H/C) is:\n        (Number of H atoms × 1) / (Number of C atoms × 12) = 1/6\n        Number of H atoms = 2 × Number of C atoms\n        So, the empirical formula of Z is CH2, and its general molecular formula is CnH2n.\n    *   A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane. An acyclic alkane has the formula CnH(2n+2).\n    *   So, Z is a cycloalkane.\n    *   We are told Z is widely used as a solvent. Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclopentane (C5H10) and cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    *   All components of mixtures X and Y have the same carbon skeleton, as they all yield only Z upon hydrogenation.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y and the Reaction X → Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This means the components of Y are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Z is a constituent of mixture Y. So, one component of Y is the cycloalkane Z.\n    *   The reaction from X to Y is a disproportionation catalyzed by platinum upon heating. A classic reaction of this type involving cyclic hydrocarbons is the Zelinsky irreversible catalysis, where a partially unsaturated six-membered ring disproportionates into an aromatic ring (oxidation) and a saturated ring (reduction).\n    *   This strongly suggests that the carbon skeleton is a six-membered ring. Therefore, Z is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n    *   Now let's identify the components of Y. One component is Z, so Y1 = cyclohexane (C6H12). Cyclohexane is saturated and does not decolorize bromine water.\n    *   The other component, Y2, must also have a C6 skeleton (since its hydrogenation gives Z) and must not decolorize bromine water. The product of oxidation of a C6-ring precursor in this type of reaction is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene does not react with bromine water under these conditions.\n    *   So, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **benzene (C6H6)** and **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n    *   Let's verify this. Hydrogenation of Y ({benzene, cyclohexane}) gives only cyclohexane (C6H6 + 3H2 → C6H12; C6H12 + H2 → no reaction). This fits the description.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2.\n    *   It decolorizes bromine water, meaning X1 and X2 are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n    *   They do not contain conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   The reaction to form Y is a disproportionation: one component of X is oxidized to benzene, and the other is reduced to cyclohexane. Since X is an equimolar mixture and Y is an equimolar mixture, the reaction is likely a 1:1 hydrogen transfer between the two components of X.\n        X1 + X2 --(Pt, heat)--> Benzene + Cyclohexane\n    *   Both X1 and X2 must have a C6 skeleton that can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane.\n    *   Let's perform an atom balance for the reaction:\n        Reactants: X1(C6Hy) + X2(C6Hz)\n        Products: Benzene(C6H6) + Cyclohexane(C6H12)\n        The total number of hydrogen atoms must be conserved: y + z = 6 + 12 = 18.\n    *   X1 and X2 are unsaturated C6 cyclic hydrocarbons. The possibilities are:\n        *   Cyclohexene (one double bond): C6H10\n        *   Cyclohexadiene (two double bonds): C6H8\n    *   Let's see if this pair fits the hydrogen atom balance: 10 + 8 = 18. Yes, it does.\n    *   The reaction can be envisioned as the cyclohexadiene donating hydrogen and being oxidized to benzene, while the cyclohexene accepts hydrogen and is reduced to cyclohexane.\n        C6H8 (H-donor) + C6H10 (H-acceptor) → C6H6 (oxidized) + C6H12 (reduced)\n    *   The problem states that there are no conjugated multiple bonds. Cyclohexene (C6H10) has only one double bond, so this is fine. For cyclohexadiene (C6H8), there are two isomers: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated). The condition implies that the diene must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene**.\n    *   So, mixture X consists of **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Answer**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of the hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n    *   Number of hydrogen atoms in cyclohexene (C6H10) = 10.\n    *   Number of hydrogen atoms in 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) = 8.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen (w(H)) of 14.28%.\n    *   Z does not react further with hydrogen, indicating it is a saturated hydrocarbon. The general formula for a saturated hydrocarbon is CnH(2n+2) (alkane) or CnH2n (cycloalkane).\n    *   Let's test the cycloalkane formula, CnH2n.\n        *   Atomic mass of C ≈ 12 g/mol\n        *   Atomic mass of H ≈ 1 g/mol\n        *   w(H) = (Mass of H) / (Total Mass) = (2n * 1) / (n * 12 + 2n * 1) = 2n / 14n = 1/7.\n    *   Let's calculate the value of 1/7.\n    ```python\n    print(1/7)\n    ```\n    *   The result is approximately 0.142857, which matches the given 14.28%.\n    *   Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n.\n    *   We are also told Z is widely used as a solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvents are cyclopentane (C5H10) and cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    *   The problem states that hydrogenation of mixture X and mixture Y gives *only* Z. This implies that all compounds in these mixtures have the same number of carbon atoms. We can infer that n=6 is the most likely case, given the reactions described (especially disproportionation leading to aromatic rings). So, let's hypothesize that **Z is cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids formed from X.\n    *   Y does *not* decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated (or aromatic, which also doesn't react with bromine water).\n    *   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of mixture Y. So, one liquid is cyclohexane (C6H12). Let's call it Y1.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n        *   Hydrogenation of Y1 (cyclohexane) gives cyclohexane (no reaction).\n        *   Hydrogenation of the other component, Y2, must also yield cyclohexane.\n    *   This reaction (Y -> Z) is a result of a disproportionation reaction (X -> Y). A classic disproportionation of cyclic C6 hydrocarbons on a Pt catalyst involves hydrogen transfer to form a saturated cycloalkane and a stable aromatic compound.\n    *   Let's propose that the products are cyclohexane and benzene.\n        *   Y1 = Cyclohexane (C6H12)\n        *   Y2 = Benzene (C6H6)\n    *   Let's check if this fits the conditions for Y:\n        *   Mixture of two liquids: Yes, at standard conditions, both are liquids.\n        *   Does not decolorize bromine water: Yes, saturated alkanes and aromatic rings do not react with Br2 water.\n        *   Hydrogenation gives only Z:\n            *   Cyclohexane + H2 -> Cyclohexane.\n            *   Benzene + 3H2 -> Cyclohexane.\n            *   This is correct. The hydrogenation of this mixture yields only cyclohexane.\n    *   The problem states that Y is an equimolar mixture. This means the disproportionation reaction that forms Y must produce cyclohexane and benzene in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n\n3.  **Identify the Components of Mixture X**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n    *   X *does* decolorize bromine water, so its components are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n    *   The molecules in X have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means both components of X must be C6 compounds whose carbon skeleton can be hydrogenated to a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The reaction X -> Y is an equimolar disproportionation. Based on our proposed Y, the reaction is:\n        (Mixture X) -> Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6) [in a 1:1 ratio]\n    *   Since X is an equimolar mixture of two components, X1 and X2, the reaction is likely:\n        **X1 + X2 -> C6H12 + C6H6**\n    *   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component is hydrogenated, the other is dehydrogenated. Let's check the atom balance.\n        *   Right side: C = 6+6 = 12; H = 12+6 = 18.\n        *   Left side must also have 12 carbons and 18 hydrogens in total from one molecule of X1 and one molecule of X2.\n    *   Let's find plausible structures for X1 and X2:\n        *   They must be C6 cyclic compounds that hydrogenate to cyclohexane.\n        *   They must be unsaturated.\n        *   They must not have conjugated bonds.\n        *   Their total H-atom count must be 18.\n    *   Let's consider unsaturated derivatives of cyclohexane:\n        *   **Cyclohexene (C6H10)**: One C=C bond. No conjugation. Hydrogenates to cyclohexane.\n        *   **1,3-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**: Two C=C bonds. They are conjugated. This is ruled out by the problem statement.\n        *   **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**: Two C=C bonds. They are isolated (not conjugated). This is a valid candidate. It hydrogenates to cyclohexane.\n    *   Let's propose X1 = Cyclohexene (C6H10) and X2 = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n        *   Are they liquids? Yes.\n        *   Are they equimolar in mixture X? Yes.\n        *   Do they decolorize bromine water? Yes.\n        *   No conjugated bonds? Correct.\n    *   Let's check the H-atom count for the reaction:\n        *   H atoms in X1 (C6H10) = 10.\n        *   H atoms in X2 (C6H8) = 8.\n        *   Total H atoms on the left = 10 + 8 = 18.\n        *   Total H atoms on the right = 12 (from C6H12) + 6 (from C6H6) = 18.\n    *   The proposed reaction, Cyclohexene + 1,4-Cyclohexadiene -> Cyclohexane + Benzene, is balanced and chemically plausible as a disproportionation on a platinum catalyst. This model fits all the conditions given in the problem.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Answer**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of X1 and one molecule of X2.\n    *   Liquid 1 (X1) is cyclohexene, C6**H10**. It has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Liquid 2 (X2) is 1,4-cyclohexadiene, C6**H8**. It has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\nHere's my thinking process to solve this chemistry problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem Statement:** I'll break down the given information into key facts about the mixtures (X, Y) and the final product (Z).\n\n    *   **Mixture X:**\n        *   Contains two liquids, A and B.\n        *   They are in an equimolar ratio (1:1).\n        *   Decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and B contain carbon-carbon double or triple bonds (they are unsaturated).\n        *   Their molecules have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n\n    *   **The Reaction:**\n        *   Mixture X (A+B) is heated with a Platinum (Pt) catalyst.\n        *   It forms mixture Y (C+D).\n        *   Mixture Y is also equimolar.\n        *   The reaction is described as a \"disproportionation.\"\n\n    *   **Mixture Y:**\n        *   Contains two liquids, C and D.\n        *   Equimolar ratio.\n        *   Does *not* decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are likely saturated (alkanes, cycloalkanes) or aromatic.\n\n    *   **Substance Z:**\n        *   Produced by the hydrogenation of *both* mixture X (A+B) and mixture Y (C+D).

Let's use atomic masses C ≈ 12 g/mol and H ≈ 1 g/mol.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as `(mass of H) / (total mass) = (y * 1) / (x * 12 + y * 1)`.\n*   Setting this equal to 14.28%, or 0.1428:\n    `y / (12x + y) = 0.1428`\n    A more precise way is to recognize that 14.28% is very close to 1/7 (1 / 7 ≈ 0.142857).\n    `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`\n    `7y = 12x + y`\n    `6y = 12x`\n    `y = 2x`\n*   This means the empirical formula of Z is CH2, and the general formula is CnH2n.\n*   We are told Z is a hydrocarbon that does not react further with hydrogen.

Among cycloalkanes, **cyclohexane (C6H12)** is a very common solvent. This fits the formula CnH2n (for n=6).\n*   Therefore, it is highly probable that **Z is cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n*   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of mixture Y.

And Y2 is saturated.\n*   The reaction that forms Y is a disproportionation. A classic disproportionation of C6 cyclic compounds involves forming a fully saturated species (cyclohexane) and a fully unsaturated one (benzene).\n    `Reactant(s) --(Pt, heat)--> Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)`\n*   Let's hypothesize that **mixture Y consists of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6)**.\n*   Let's check if this fits the criteria for Y:\n    *   Equimolar mixture of two liquids: Benzene and cyclohexane are both liquids at room temperature. The reaction stoichiometry needs to be checked, but this is a plausible composition.\n    *   Does not decolorize bromine water: Neither benzene (under these conditions) nor cyclohexane reacts with bromine water. This fits.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z:\n        *   Cyclohexane + H2 → Cyclohexane (Z).\n        *   Benzene + 3H2 --(severe conditions)--> Cyclohexane (Z). This reaction requires severe conditions (high pressure/temperature), which matches the problem description. This fits.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Components of Mixture X**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that, upon disproportionation, forms mixture Y (cyclohexane + benzene).\n*   This means the overall reaction is: `X1 + X2 --(Pt, heat)--> C6H6 + C6H12`\n*   Since the products are equimolar (1 mole of benzene and 1 mole of cyclohexane), the reactants X1 and X2 must also be equimolar (1 mole of X1 and 1 mole of X2).\n*   This reaction is a hydrogen transfer: one reactant loses hydrogen (is oxidized) and the other gains hydrogen (is reduced).\n*   The total number of atoms must be conserved. The products have (6+6)=12 Carbon atoms and (6+12)=18 Hydrogen atoms. Therefore, the reactants X1+X2 must also have a total of 12 Carbon and 18 Hydrogen atoms. Since all species are C6 based (as they all hydrogenate to cyclohexane), X1 and X2 must be C6 hydrocarbons. So, X1 is C6Ha and X2 is C6Hb, where a+b=18.\n*   X1 and X2 decolorize bromine water, so they are unsaturated (contain C=C bonds).\n*   A key constraint is that there are **no conjugated multiple bonds** in the compounds of mixture X.\n*   Let's propose reactants that would logically lead to the products.\n    *   The formation of benzene (C6H6) requires an H-donor. A likely candidate is a cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   The formation of cyclohexane (C6H12) requires an H-acceptor. A likely candidate is cyclohexene (C6H10).\n*   Let's test this pair: X1 = **Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)** and X2 = **Cyclohexene (C6H10)**.\n    *   The hydrogen atoms sum to 8 + 10 = 18. This matches the products.\n    *   The reaction would be: `C6H8 + C6H10 --(Pt, heat)--> C6H6 + C6H12`. This is a balanced hydrogen transfer reaction. Cyclohexadiene loses 2H to become benzene, and cyclohexene gains 2H to become cyclohexane.\n*   Let's check the constraints for X:\n    *   Decolorize bromine water: Both have double bonds. Yes.\n    *   No conjugated bonds: There are two isomers of cyclohexadiene: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated). The problem specifies no conjugated bonds, so X1 must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene**. Cyclohexene has only one double bond, so it is not conjugated. This fits perfectly.\n    *   Hydrogenation of X gives only Z:\n        *   1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) + 2H2 → Cyclohexane (C6H12). Yes.\n        *   Cyclohexene (C6H10) + H2 → Cyclohexane (C6H12). Yes.\n\nAll conditions are met with this scheme.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\nThe two liquids in mixture X are:\n1.  1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8), which has **8** hydrogen atoms.\n2.  Cyclohexene (C6H10), which has **10** hydrogen atoms.\n\nTotal number of hydrogen atoms = 8 + 10 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 55:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given as 14.28%.\n    *   Let's determine the empirical formula of Z. The mass fraction of hydrogen in a hydrocarbon CₙHₘ is given by `(m * M_H) / (n * M_C + m * M_H)`, where M_H and M_C are the atomic masses of hydrogen and carbon, respectively.\n    *   Using approximate integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1), the fraction is `m / (12n + m)`.\n    *   The given percentage 14.28% is very close to 1/7 (since 1/7 ≈ 0.142857). Let's check if the formula for a cycloalkane, CₙH₂ₙ, fits this. The mass fraction of hydrogen in CₙH₂ₙ is `2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 2/14 = 1/7`.\n    *   This is a perfect match. So, the general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen. This confirms it is a saturated compound, so it cannot be an alkene. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y**\n    *   Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n    *   One of the constituents of Y is substance Z (a cycloalkane, CₙH₂ₙ).\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water, which means its components are saturated or aromatic. Z is saturated.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z. Let the other component of Y be D. So, hydrogenating the mixture {Z, D} gives only Z. Since Z is already saturated, this implies that hydrogenating D must yield Z.\n    *   For D to be hydrogenated to Z (a cycloalkane), and also not decolorize bromine water on its own, it must be an aromatic compound with the same carbon skeleton as Z. The general formula for such an arene with a single aromatic ring derived from a Cₙ cycloalkane would be CₙH₂ₙ₋₆ (by loss of 3 H₂ molecules). For instance, benzene (C₆H₆) hydrogenates to cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). Toluene (C₇H₈) hydrogenates to methylcyclohexane (C₇H₁₄).\n    *   So, mixture Y consists of an equimolar mixture of a cycloalkane (Z) and its corresponding aromatic analog (D): Y = {CₙH₂ₙ, CₙH₂ₙ₋₆}.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction from X to Y**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n    *   The reaction `X → Y` is described as a disproportionation. This reaction happens on a platinum catalyst with heating. This is characteristic of hydrogen transfer reactions among unsaturated cyclic compounds.\n    *   The reaction forms an equimolar mixture Y. Since X is also equimolar, the stoichiometry of the reaction is 1A + 1B → 1Z + 1D.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z. This means both A and B must have the same carbon skeleton as Z. So, A and B are unsaturated hydrocarbons with the formula CₙHₐ and CₙHᵦ, respectively.\n\n4.  **Determine the Number of Hydrogen Atoms**\n    *   Let's write the balanced chemical equation for the disproportionation:\n        `CₙHₐ (A) + CₙHᵦ (B) → CₙH₂ₙ (Z) + CₙH₂ₙ₋₆ (D)`\n        (Note: For the case of Toluene D=C₇H₈ and Z=C₇H₁₄, the formula for D is CₙH₂ₙ₋₆ as well, since 2n-6 = 2*7-6=8).\n    *   By the law of conservation of mass, the number of hydrogen atoms on both sides of the equation must be equal.\n        `a + b = 2n + (2n - 6) = 4n - 6` (This general formula seems complex, let's stick to concrete examples).\n\n5.  **Identify the Specific Compounds (or Carbon Skeleton)**\n    *   Z is described as being \"widely used as a solvent\". Both cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and methylcyclohexane (C₇H₁₄) are common solvents and fit the CₙH₂ₙ formula and the H mass fraction.\n    *   **Case 1: The C₆ system.** Let's assume Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). This is the most classic example for this type of reaction.\n        *   Z = Cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂.\n        *   D = Benzene, C₆H₆.\n        *   Mixture Y = {Cyclohexane, Benzene}.\n        *   The reaction is: `A(C₆Hₐ) + B(C₆Hᵦ) → Cyclohexane(C₆H₁₂) + Benzene(C₆H₆)`.\n        *   Balancing the hydrogen atoms: `a + b = 12 + 6 = 18`.\n        *   This scenario is chemically sound. For instance, A and B could be cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈). `10 + 8 = 18`. Both are unsaturated, non-conjugated, and would hydrogenate to cyclohexane.\n\n    *   **Case 2: The C₇ system.** Let's assume Z is methylcyclohexane (C₇H₁₄).\n        *   Z = Methylcyclohexane, C₇H₁₄.\n        *   D = Toluene, C₇H₈.\n        *   Mixture Y = {Methylcyclohexane, Toluene}.\n        *   The reaction is: `A(C₇Hₐ) + B(C₇Hᵦ) → Methylcyclohexane(C₇H₁₄) + Toluene(C₇H₈)`.\n        *   Balancing the hydrogen atoms: `a + b = 14 + 8 = 22`.\n\n6.  **Conclusion**\n    *   We have two plausible answers based on the carbon skeleton: 18 (for C₆) and 22 (for C₇). Both are listed as options (B and D).\n    *   The reaction described is a classic example of Zelinsky disproportionation chemistry, for which the cyclohexane/benzene system is the primary textbook example. In the absence of further information to distinguish the two cases, it is most probable that the question refers to this fundamental C₆ system.\n    *   The question asks for the \"total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X\". This corresponds to the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B, which is `a + b`.\n    *   Based on the C₆ model, this sum is 18.\n\nTherefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the chemistry problem.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon with the formula C_n H_m.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. Let's express this as a fraction: 14.28% ≈ 14.28/100 ≈ 1/7.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula: `Mass_fraction(H) = (m * M_H) / (n * M_C + m * M_H)`, where M_H and M_C are the atomic masses of hydrogen and carbon, respectively.\n*   Using approximate integer masses (C=12, H=1), which is common in such problems, we get: `1/7 = (m * 1) / (n * 12 + m * 1)`\n*   This simplifies to `12n + m = 7m`, which gives `12n = 6m`, or `m = 2n`.\n*   A hydrocarbon with the formula C_n H_{2n} can be either an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n*   The problem states that Z is formed by hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n*   The problem also states that Z is widely used as a solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent with a six-membered ring structure (which we will see is required later) is cyclohexane.\n*   Let's check for cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂. Here, n=6 and m=12, so m=2n. This fits our derived formula. Let's confirm the mass fraction with C=12 and H=1: `Mass_fraction(H) = 12 / (6*12 + 12) = 12 / (72 + 12) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%`.\n*   Thus, hydrocarbon Z is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Carbon Skeleton of the Compounds**\n\n*   The problem states that hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y gives *only one substance*, which is Z (cyclohexane).\n*   Hydrogenation is a reaction that adds hydrogen across double/triple bonds or opens certain rings, but it typically does not rearrange the carbon skeleton under these conditions.\n*   Since the only final product is cyclohexane (a C₆ ring), all the compounds in both mixture X and mixture Y must have a six-carbon ring skeleton.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is formed from mixture X by heating with platinum. It's an equimolar mixture of two liquids and does not decolorize bromine water.\n*   This indicates that the components of Y are saturated or aromatic.\n*   One of the components of Y is Z, which is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). Cyclohexane is saturated and does not decolorize bromine water.\n*   The reaction to form Y is described as a disproportionation. In catalytic reactions involving unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbons and platinum, this often means hydrogen transfer. An intermediate unsaturated compound is converted into a fully saturated one (reduction) and a fully unsaturated (aromatic) one (oxidation).\n*   Since cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) is the reduced product, the other component must be the oxidized product. The ultimate oxidation product of a C₆ ring is **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n*   Benzene does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions (it requires a Lewis acid catalyst).\n*   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **benzene (C₆H₆)** and **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n*   Let's check if hydrogenating mixture Y gives only Z.\n    *   Hydrogenation of benzene: C₆H₆ + 3H₂ → C₆H₁₂ (cyclohexane)\n    *   Hydrogenation of cyclohexane: No reaction.\n*   So, hydrogenation of mixture Y correctly yields only cyclohexane (Z).\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Components of Mixture X and Solve the Question**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them X₁ and X₂.\n*   X decolorizes bromine water, meaning X₁ and X₂ are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n*   Molecules in X have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   When mixture X is treated, it yields an equimolar mixture Y. This suggests a 1:1 stoichiometric reaction between the components of X to form the components of Y.\n    *   X₁ + X₂ → Y₁ + Y₂\n    *   X₁ + X₂ → Benzene (C₆H₆) + Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)\n*   Since all molecules have a C₆ skeleton, we only need to balance the hydrogen atoms. The total number of hydrogen atoms must be conserved.\n    *   Total H atoms on the left = Total H atoms on the right\n    *   H atoms in X₁ + H atoms in X₂ = H atoms in benzene + H atoms in cyclohexane\n    *   H atoms in X₁ + H atoms in X₂ = 6 + 12 = 18.\n*   We need to find two unsaturated, non-conjugated C₆-ring compounds whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18.\n*   The possible candidates are:\n    *   **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)**: It has one C=C bond and is not conjugated.\n    *   **Cyclohexadienes (C₆H₈)**: There are two isomers: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated). The problem rules out the conjugated one.\n*   So our candidates for X₁ and X₂ are **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n*   Let's check if their hydrogen atoms sum to 18:\n    *   10 (from cyclohexene) + 8 (from 1,4-cyclohexadiene) = 18.\n*   This fits perfectly. The reaction is a catalytic hydrogen transfer: 1,4-cyclohexadiene loses two hydrogens to become benzene, and cyclohexene gains those two hydrogens to become cyclohexane.\n    *   C₆H₈ (1,4-cyclohexadiene) + C₆H₁₀ (cyclohexene) → C₆H₆ (benzene) + C₆H₁₂ (cyclohexane)\n*   The question asks for \"the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X\". This means the sum of the hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n*   Total hydrogen atoms = (H in X₁) + (H in X₂) = 8 + 10 = 18.\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z:**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CxHy. The mass fraction of H is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   `y / (12x + y) = 0.1428`.\n    *   This is very close to 1/7 (which is approximately 0.142857). If the mass fraction is 1/7, then `7y = 12x + y`, which means `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n    *   A formula of CxH2x, or CnH2n, corresponds to an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z is the result of hydrogenating other substances and does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a saturated hydrocarbon.\n    *   Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Carbon Skeleton:**\n    *   Mixture X (containing liquids A and B) and mixture Y (containing liquids C and D) can both be hydrogenated to yield *only* substance Z.\n    *   This is a critical clue. It implies that all four compounds (A, B, C, D) share the exact same carbon skeleton as Z. The differences between them are only the number of hydrogen atoms (i.e., the degree of unsaturation).\n    *   Since Z is a cycloalkane, A, B, C, and D must all be based on the same cyclic carbon skeleton.\n\n3.  **Identify Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (C and D) that does not decolorize bromine water. This suggests they are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   We know one component of Y is Z itself. Let's say C = Z.\n    *   So, C = CnH2n (a cycloalkane), which is saturated.\n    *   The other component, D, must also not decolorize bromine water but must hydrogenate to Z. The most logical candidate for D is an aromatic compound with the same carbon skeleton.\n    *   Aromatization of a CnH2n cycloalkane ring typically involves the formation of a benzene ring structure. This process involves the loss of at least 6 hydrogen atoms. The general formula for a mono-alkyl substituted benzene is CnH2n-8 (e.g. Toluene C7H8) while Benzene itself is C6H6. A general formula that links an alkyl-cycloalkane CnH2n to its corresponding aromatic is CnH2n-6 (e.g., hydrogenating C6H6 (Benzene) gives C6H12 (Cyclohexane), and H count difference is 6; hydrogenating C7H8 (Toluene) gives C7H14 (Methylcyclohexane), and H count difference is 6).\n    *   So, we can deduce: Y = {C (CnH2n), D (CnH2n-6)}.\n\n4.  **Identify Mixture X and the Disproportionation Reaction:**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (A and B) that decolorize bromine water (so they are unsaturated) and have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   X is converted to Y via a disproportionation reaction upon heating with a platinum catalyst.\n    *   The overall reaction converts the equimolar mixture X into the equimolar mixture Y. The simplest and most direct interpretation is a 1:1 reaction: A + B → C + D.\n    *   In a disproportionation reaction involving hydrocarbons, hydrogen atoms are transferred from one molecule to another. One molecule is oxidized (loses H), and another is reduced (gains H).\n    *   Let's check the hydrogen atom balance:\n        H(A) + H(B) = H(C) + H(D)\n        H(A) + H(B) = (2n) + (2n - 6) = 4n - 6.\n    *   The components of X, A and B, must be unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbons with a C_n skeleton. The most common types are cycloalkenes (formula CnH2n-2) and cycloalkadienes (formula CnH2n-4).\n    *   Let's assume A is a cycloalkene (CnH2n-2) and B is a non-conjugated cycloalkadiene (CnH2n-4).\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms in one pair of molecules from X = (2n-2) + (2n-4) = 4n - 6.\n    *   This perfectly matches the hydrogen atom count for Y. This confirms our assignments for A and B.\n    *   The reaction is: CnH2n-2 (cycloalkene) + CnH2n-4 (diene) → CnH2n (cycloalkane) + CnH2n-6 (aromatic). This is a plausible intermolecular hydrogen transfer, where the diene donates hydrogen to the alkene.\n\n5.  **Determine the value of 'n':**\n    *   The problem can now be solved if we can find 'n'. The information given (\"widely used as a solvent\", etc.) is general enough to apply to several possibilities. Let's test small, common values for `n` (noting that n must be at least 6 to form a benzene ring).\n    *   **Case n=6:**\n        *   Z = C6H12 (Cyclohexane). %H = 12/84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.3%. It's a common solvent.\n        *   Y = {C6H12 (Cyclohexane), C6H6 (Benzene)}. An equimolar mixture. Both don't decolorize Br2 water.\n        *   X = {C6H10 (Cyclohexene), C6H8 (Cyclohexa-1,4-diene)}. Both are unsaturated liquids. Cyclohexa-1,4-diene is non-conjugated.\n        *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X would be 10 + 8 = 18. This matches option C. This entire scenario is chemically consistent.\n    *   **Case n=7:**\n        *   Z = C7H14 (Methylcyclohexane). %H = 14/98 = 1/7 ≈ 14.3%. Also used as a solvent.\n        *   Y = {C7H14 (Methylcyclohexane), C7H8 (Toluene)}.\n        *   X = {C7H12 (a Methylcyclohexene), C7H10 (a non-conjugated Methylcyclohexadiene)}.\n        *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in X would be 12 + 10 = 22. This matches option A. This scenario is also chemically consistent.\n\n6.  **Resolve the Ambiguity:**\n    *   Both the n=6 and n=7 cases are chemically plausible and match options in the multiple-choice list. However, such problems in chemistry contests are typically designed to have a single correct answer.\n    *   The n=6 system (cyclohexane/benzene) is the most fundamental and archetypal example of these types of disproportionation and hydrogenation reactions involving cyclic compounds. The C7 system is essentially the same chemistry but with an added methyl group. In the absence of information to the contrary, the simplest, parent system is the intended answer.\n    *   Therefore, we choose n=6.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   For n=6, the two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8).\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each liquid is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze and identify substance Z.**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with the general formula CnHm.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is given as 14.28%. Let's use the approximate atomic masses: Ar(H) ≈ 1 and Ar(C) ≈ 12.\n    *   The formula for the mass fraction of hydrogen is: `(m * Ar(H)) / (n * Ar(C) + m * Ar(H)) = 0.1428`.\n    *   Substituting the values: `m / (12n + m) ≈ 0.1428`.\n    *   The value 0.1428 is very close to 1/7. So, let's assume the mass fraction is exactly 1/7.\n    *   `m / (12n + m) = 1/7`\n    *   `7m = 12n + m`\n    *   `6m = 12n`\n    *   `m = 2n`.\n    *   So, the molecular formula of Z is `CnH2n`.\n    *   We are told Z is saturated (does not react further with hydrogen). A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula `CnH2n` must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y gives *only one* substance, Z. This means all compounds in X and Y have the same carbon skeleton.\n    *   We are also told that Z is a constituent of mixture Y, which is formed by a disproportionation reaction. Disproportionation of an unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbon (which must be in X) typically yields an aromatic compound and a saturated cycloalkane. This strongly suggests that the carbon skeleton is a 6-membered ring.\n    *   Therefore, the saturated cycloalkane Z is cyclohexane (`C6H12`), and the corresponding aromatic compound would be benzene (`C6H6`).\n    *   Let's verify our assumptions: Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12). It is widely used as a solvent. The mass percentage of hydrogen in C6H12 is `(12 * 1) / (6 * 12 + 12 * 1) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%`. This confirms our identification.\n\n2.  **Identify the components of mixture Y.**\n    *   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water, which is true for saturated and aromatic compounds.\n    *   Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n    *   Z (cyclohexane, C6H12) is one of the components.\n    *   Y is formed by the disproportionation of X. As reasoned above, this reaction would produce cyclohexane and benzene.\n    *   So, the other component of Y must be benzene (C6H6). Benzene does not decolorize bromine water under these conditions.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y (cyclohexane and benzene) would yield only cyclohexane, as stated in the problem (`C6H6 + 3H2 → C6H12`).\n    *   Therefore, mixture Y consists of equimolar amounts of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6).\n\n3.  **Identify the components of mixture X.**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n    *   They undergo disproportionation upon heating with platinum to form an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6). The reaction is: `A + B → C6H12 + C6H6`.\n    *   From the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms on both sides must be equal. If A is C6Hx and B is C6Hy, then the total number of hydrogen atoms is `x + y = 12 + 6 = 18`.\n    *   X decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds).\n    *   Hydrogenation of X gives only cyclohexane, so A and B must both have a six-membered carbon ring skeleton.\n    *   The problem states that there are no *conjugated* multiple bonds in the molecules of X.\n    *   Let's consider possible unsaturated C6 ring compounds:\n        *   Cyclohexene (C6H10): Has one double bond, not conjugated.\n        *   1,3-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8): Has two double bonds which are conjugated. This is ruled out.\n        *   1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8): Has two isolated (non-conjugated) double bonds.\n    *   The two components of mixture X must therefore be cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   Let's check if this is consistent.\n        *   A = C6H10 (cyclohexene)\n        *   B = C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene)\n        *   Total hydrogen atoms: `10 + 8 = 18`. This matches our atom balance.\n        *   Reaction: `C6H10 + C6H8 --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 + C6H6`. This is a plausible hydrogen transfer (disproportionation) reaction where the more unsaturated compound (diene) is dehydrogenated to benzene, and the less unsaturated one (monoene) is hydrogenated to cyclohexane.\n        *   Since mixture X is equimolar, the reaction produces an equimolar mixture Y.

Let's determine its general formula.\n    *   The mass percentage of hydrogen is calculated as `(mass of H) / (total mass) * 100%`. The atomic mass of Carbon (C) is ~12 g/mol and Hydrogen (H) is ~1 g/mol.\n    *   14.28% is numerically very close to the fraction 1/7 (since 1/7 ≈ 0.142857).\n    *   Let's test the general formula for alkanes, CnH(2n+2). Mass % H = `(2n+2) / (12n + 2n+2) = (2n+2) / (14n+2)`. Setting this to 1/7 gives `7(2n+2) = 14n+2`, which simplifies to `14n+14 = 14n+2`, an impossibility.\n    *   Let's test the general formula for cycloalkanes or alkenes, CnH2n. Mass % H = `(2n) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7`. This matches perfectly.\n    *   The problem states Z is a hydrocarbon that does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is saturated. A hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n that is saturated must be a **cycloalkane**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y.**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, C and D.\n    *   It does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are either saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Z is a constituent of Y. Let's say C = Z. So, C is a cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z. This means `Hydrogenation(C + D) -> Z`.\n    *   Since C is Z (a saturated cycloalkane), it does not hydrogenate. Therefore, the other component, D, must hydrogenate to Z: `Hydrogenation(D) -> Z`.\n    *   Since D does not decolorize bromine water but reacts with hydrogen under \"rather severe conditions\" to give a cycloalkane Z, D must be an **aromatic hydrocarbon** with the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n    *   The simplest and most common chemical system that fits this description is the **benzene/cyclohexane pair**. This corresponds to a 6-carbon atom skeleton (n=6).\n    *   So, Z = **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and D = **benzene (C6H6)**.\n    *   Let's verify these fit the description:\n        *   Z (cyclohexane) is a widely used solvent. Correct.\n        *   Y = {cyclohexane, benzene}. This is a mixture of two liquids. Both do not decolorize bromine water. Correct.\n    *   Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane and benzene.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Disproportionation Reaction.**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B.\n    *   A and B decolorize bromine water, so they are unsaturated (contain C=C bonds).\n    *   \"There are no conjugated multiple bonds\" is a condition on their structure.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means `Hydrogenation(A) -> Cyclohexane` and `Hydrogenation(B) -> Cyclohexane`. This confirms A and B are unsaturated hydrocarbons with a 6-carbon cyclic skeleton. They are isomers of cyclohexene or cyclohexadiene.\n    *   The reaction `X -> Y` is a disproportionation that happens on a platinum catalyst. An equimolar mixture of X {A, B} gives an equimolar mixture of Y {cyclohexane, benzene}.\n    *   This implies a 1:1 reaction stoichiometry: `A + B --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 + C6H6`.\n    *   This type of reaction is a catalytic hydrogen transfer. One molecule is the hydrogen donor (it gets dehydrogenated/oxidized to benzene), and the other is the hydrogen acceptor (it gets hydrogenated/reduced to cyclohexane).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms.**\n    *   The chemical reaction involves the atoms of the reactants A and B rearranging to form the products, cyclohexane and benzene. The total number of atoms of each element must be conserved.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (one molecule of A and one molecule of B) must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products (one molecule of cyclohexane and one molecule of benzene).\n    *   Number of H atoms in cyclohexane (C6H12) = 12.\n    *   Number of H atoms in benzene (C6H6) = 6.\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   This sum represents the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n\n5.  **Final Check.**\n    *   The total number of hydrogens is 18. The components of X must be unsaturated C6 cyclic hydrocarbons whose hydrogens sum to 18. The most plausible candidates are **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and a **cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n    *   `10 + 8 = 18`. This is consistent.\n    *   A cyclohexadiene isomer that is not conjugated is **1,4-cyclohexadiene**. Cyclohexene has only one double bond, so it cannot be conjugated. The condition \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" is satisfied.\n    *   The reaction `C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) + C6H10 (cyclohexene) -> C6H6 (benzene) + C6H12 (cyclohexane)` is a known hydrogen transfer reaction. The diene gives up 2 hydrogens to the ene. Everything is consistent.\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which we calculated to be 18.\n\nFinal Answer based on the options:\nA) 22\nB) 16\nC) 18\nD) 12\n\nThe calculated value is 18, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 60:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let its formula be CxHy.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by: Mass%(H) = (y * M(H)) / (x * M(C) + y * M(H)), where M are molar masses.\n    *   Using approximate integer masses (M(H)≈1, M(C)≈12): 0.1428 ≈ y / (12x + y).\n    *   This fraction 0.1428 is very close to 1/7. 1/7 ≈ 0.142857.\n    *   So, y / (12x + y) ≈ 1/7  => 7y ≈ 12x + y => 6y ≈ 12x => y ≈ 2x.\n    *   This means the empirical formula of Z is CH2.\n    *   The general formula for a saturated acyclic hydrocarbon (alkane) is CnH2n+2. The mass % of H would be (2n+2)/(14n+2).\n    *   The general formula for a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon (cycloalkane) is CnH2n. The mass % of H is (2n)/(14n) = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%.\n    *   This perfectly matches the given data. So, Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states that Z is a widely used solvent and is stable, which points towards common cycloalkanes like cyclopentane or cyclohexane.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reactions and Mixtures**\n    *   **Hydrogenation:** Mixture X (two liquids A and B) and mixture Y (two liquids C and D) both yield *only* Z upon hydrogenation under severe conditions. This implies that A, B, C, and D all have the same number of carbon atoms and the same carbon skeleton as Z, or a skeleton that can be converted to Z's skeleton under these conditions (e.g., through isomerization or ring expansion/contraction).\n    *   **Mixture Y:** Y does not decolorize bromine water. This indicates its components are saturated (contain no C=C or C≡C bonds). An exception is aromatic rings, which do not react with bromine water under these conditions. Z is a component of Y. So let C = Z. Since C is saturated (a cycloalkane), it will not decolorize bromine water. The other component, D, must also not decolorize bromine water.\n    *   **The Disproportionation Reaction:** Mixture X is converted to Mixture Y via a disproportionation reaction on a platinum catalyst. A disproportionation reaction is a redox reaction where a substance is simultaneously oxidized and reduced. In this context, it refers to a hydrogen transfer reaction where some molecules gain hydrogen (are reduced) and others lose hydrogen (are oxidized).\n\n3.  **Deduce the Identities of Y and Z**\n    *   The classic example of such a disproportionation is the Zelinsky-Kazansky reaction. For example, cyclohexene disproportionates over platinum to form cyclohexane and benzene. Let's test this model.\n    *   Let's hypothesize that the reaction produces a cycloalkane (saturated) and an aromatic compound (which doesn't decolorize Br2 water). This would fit the description of Y.\n    *   If we assume a 6-carbon skeleton (based on cyclohexane being a very common solvent and benzene being the simplest aromatic product), we can propose:\n        *   Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12). Mass %H = 12/84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%. This fits.\n        *   Y = A mixture of Cyclohexane (Z) and Benzene (C6H6).\n    *   Let's check this hypothesis for Y against the facts:\n        *   Y is a mixture of two liquids? Yes, cyclohexane and benzene are liquids.\n        *   Y does not decolorize bromine water? Yes, cyclohexane is saturated, and benzene does not react.\n        *   Z is a constituent of Y? Yes, cyclohexane is a component.\n        *   Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z? Hydrogenation of cyclohexane gives cyclohexane. Hydrogenation of benzene gives cyclohexane. So, yes, the only product is Z.\n    *   This hypothesis (Y = {Cyclohexane, Benzene}) is consistent with all the facts.\n\n4.  **Deduce the Identities of X**\n    *   Mixture X = {A, B} is equimolar.\n    *   Mixture Y = {Cyclohexane, Benzene} is also equimolar.\n    *   This strongly suggests a 1:1 reaction stoichiometry: A + B -> Cyclohexane + Benzene.\n    *   This is an intermolecular hydrogen transfer. One molecule (A) is reduced to cyclohexane (C6H12), and the other (B) is oxidized to benzene (C6H6).\n    *   Let's look at the hydrogen balance. Let A = C6Ha and B = C6Hb.\n        *   Ha + Hb = H(cyclohexane) + H(benzene) = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   Now let's identify A and B from the properties of mixture X:\n        *   They are C6-based compounds whose skeletons hydrogenate to cyclohexane. This suggests they are cyclic C6 compounds.\n        *   They decolorize bromine water, so they are unsaturated (contain at least one C=C bond).\n        *   They do not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   We need two such compounds, C6Ha and C6Hb, where a+b=18.\n        *   Let's consider possible cyclic C6 alkenes/alkadienes.\n        *   **Cyclohexene (C6H10)**: One C=C bond. Not conjugated. Hydrogenates to cyclohexane. A strong candidate for A. If A is C6H10, then Ha = 10.\n        *   **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**: Two C=C bonds, but they are not conjugated (separated by two single bonds). Hydrogenates to cyclohexane. A strong candidate for B. If B is C6H8, then Hb = 8.\n    *   Let's check the sum of hydrogens: Ha + Hb = 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our requirement.\n    *   The proposed reaction is:\n        **C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)**\n    *   In this reaction, the diene is oxidized (loses 2H) and the monoene is reduced (gains 2H). It's a balanced redox process that produces the products in a 1:1 molar ratio, consistent with Y being an equimolar mixture. All components of X and Y hydrogenate to cyclohexane. X has no conjugated bonds and decolorizes bromine water. Y does not. This model fits all constraints perfectly.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.

This is equivalent to 0.1428.\n*   The mass fraction can be expressed as: `(mass of H) / (total mass) = (y * 1.008) / (x * 12.011 + y * 1.008)`. For simplicity, we can use atomic masses of H=1 and C=12.\n*   `y / (12x + y) = 0.1428`\n*   The fraction 1/7 is approximately 0.142857, which is a very close match. So, let's assume `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`.\n*   `7y = 12x + y`\n*   `6y = 12x`\n*   `y = 2x`\n*   This means the empirical formula of Z is (CH2)n, and the molecular formula is CnH2n.\n*   The problem states that Z is formed from hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a saturated hydrocarbon.\n*   A saturated hydrocarbon with the general formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n*   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. The most common and stable cycloalkane used as a solvent is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n*   Let's check the hydrogen mass fraction for cyclohexane: H% = (12 * 1) / (6 * 12 + 12 * 1) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%. This confirms that Z is very likely cyclohexane.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n*   It does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated or aromatic. Benzene, despite being unsaturated, does not react with bromine water under normal conditions due to its aromatic stability.\n*   Z (cyclohexane, C6H12) is a constituent of mixture Y. So, one component of Y is cyclohexane.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n*   Let the two components of Y be Y1 and Y2. We have Y1 = cyclohexane (C6H12).\n*   When mixture Y is hydrogenated, Y1 (cyclohexane) does not react. Y2 must hydrogenate to form cyclohexane.\n*   Since Y2 does not decolorize bromine water, it could be another saturated C6 isomer or an aromatic compound. If it were a saturated isomer like methylcyclopentane, severe hydrogenation would cause ring-opening to form alkanes (like n-hexane or methylpentane), not just cyclohexane. This contradicts the condition that *only* Z is formed.\n*   The most plausible candidate for Y2 is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene does not decolorize bromine water and its hydrogenation yields cyclohexane: `C6H6 + 3H2 --(Pt)--> C6H12`.\n*   So, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Components of Mixture X and Solve the Problem**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2.\n*   When heated with platinum, X undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form Y. A disproportionation in this context involves hydrogen transfer, where one component is oxidized (loses hydrogen) and the other is reduced (gains hydrogen).\n*   The reaction is: `X1 + X2 --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 + C6H6`. Since the products are equimolar, the stoichiometry is 1:1 on both sides.\n*   From the law of conservation of mass, we can balance the atoms.\n    *   Carbon: C atoms in (X1 + X2) = C atoms in (C6H12 + C6H6) = 6 + 6 = 12.\n    *   Hydrogen: H atoms in (X1 + X2) = H atoms in (C6H12 + C6H6) = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This implies that both X1 and X2 must have a six-carbon ring structure. So, their formulas are C6Hx and C6Hy.\n*   We know `x + y = 18`.\n*   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, meaning X1 and X2 are unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds).\n*   There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of X.\n*   Let's consider possible non-conjugated, unsaturated C6-ring compounds:\n    *   **Cyclohexene (C6H10)**: One double bond. Non-conjugated.\n    *   **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**: Two double bonds, which are not conjugated.\n    *   (1,3-Cyclohexadiene has conjugated bonds, so it is ruled out).\n*   Let's test if these two compounds fit our hydrogen count:\n    *   If X1 = Cyclohexene (C6H10) and X2 = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our requirement.\n*   The disproportionation reaction would be:\n    `C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) + C6H10 (cyclohexene) --> C6H6 (benzene) + C6H12 (cyclohexane)`\n    In this reaction, the diene is oxidized to benzene by losing 2H, and the cyclohexene is reduced to cyclohexane by gaining 2H. This is a plausible catalytic hydrogen transfer.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n\nTotal H atoms = (H atoms in C6H10) + (H atoms in C6H8) = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon, and the mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%.\n*   We can test the general formulas for hydrocarbons. For a saturated hydrocarbon, the formula is CnH(2n+2) (alkane) or CnH2n (cycloalkane).\n*   Let's calculate the mass fraction of hydrogen for a cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n    *   Molar mass of C ≈ 12 g/mol\n    *   Molar mass of H ≈ 1 g/mol\n    *   Molar mass of CnH2n ≈ 12n + 2n = 14n\n    *   Mass of hydrogen = 2n\n    *   Mass fraction of H = (2n) / (14n) = 2/14 = 1/7\n*   Converting 1/7 to a percentage: (1/7) * 100% ≈ 14.2857%. This is a perfect match for the given 14.28%.\n*   Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane with the general formula CnH2n.\n*   The problem states that Z is widely used as a solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n*   The fact that Z does not react further with hydrogen confirms it is a saturated compound like a cycloalkane.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n*   Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are either saturated (alkanes/cycloalkanes) or aromatic.\n*   Z (cyclohexane, C6H12) is a constituent of mixture Y. So, one component is cyclohexane.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives *only* Z (cyclohexane). Let Y = (Cyclohexane + Compound D).\n    *   Cyclohexane does not react with hydrogen.\n    *   So, hydrogenation of Compound D must produce cyclohexane.\n    *   Compound D must also not decolorize bromine water.\n*   If D were a saturated isomer of cyclohexane (like methylcyclopentane), it would have a different carbon skeleton. While severe hydrogenation might cause rearrangement, a more direct interpretation is needed.\n*   Let's consider D being an aromatic compound. Aromatic compounds do not decolorize bromine water under standard test conditions but can be hydrogenated.\n*   The only aromatic hydrocarbon with a six-carbon skeleton is **benzene (C6H6)**.\n*   Let's check if this fits:\n    *   Hydrogenation of benzene: C6H6 + 3H2 --(Pt, severe)--> C6H12 (cyclohexane). This is a well-known reaction.\n    *   Therefore, the hydrogenation of a mixture of benzene and cyclohexane would yield only cyclohexane.\n*   So, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **benzene (C6H6)** and **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Components of Mixture X**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n*   X decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This implies that both A and B must have a six-carbon ring skeleton.\n*   There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of mixture X.\n*   The reaction from X to Y is a disproportionation reaction on a platinum catalyst:\n    A + B --(Pt, heat)--> Benzene (C6H6) + Cyclohexane (C6H12)\n*   Since X and Y are both equimolar mixtures, the reaction stoichiometry must be 1:1 -> 1:1.\n*   This reaction is an intermolecular hydrogen transfer. One molecule (the hydrogen donor) is dehydrogenated to benzene, and the other (the hydrogen acceptor) is hydrogenated to cyclohexane.\n*   Let's analyze the hydrogen balance for the reaction:\n    Total H atoms in reactants = Total H atoms in products\n    H(A) + H(B) = H(Benzene) + H(Cyclohexane)\n    H(A) + H(B) = 6 + 12 = 18\n*   Now we need to find two unsaturated C6-ring compounds (A and B) that are not conjugated and have a total of 18 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Possible unsaturated C6-ring compounds:\n        *   **Cyclohexene (C6H10)**: Has 10 H atoms. It is not conjugated.\n        *   Cyclohexa-1,3-diene (C6H8): Has 8 H atoms, but its double bonds are conjugated. The problem states there are no conjugated bonds, so this is ruled out.\n        *   **Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)**: Has 8 H atoms. Its double bonds are separated by two CH2 groups, so they are not conjugated. This is a valid candidate.\n*   Let's see if A = Cyclohexene and B = Cyclohexa-1,4-diene fit the criteria.\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms = H(C6H10) + H(C6H8) = 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our required hydrogen balance.\n    *   The reaction would be:\n        C6H8 (Cyclohexa-1,4-diene) + C6H10 (Cyclohexene) --> C6H6 (Benzene) + C6H12 (Cyclohexane)\n        The diene loses 2 hydrogens to become benzene, and the cyclohexene gains those 2 hydrogens to become cyclohexane. This is a chemically plausible disproportionation (catalytic hydrogen transfer).\n*   Therefore, the two liquids in mixture X are **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms**\n\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n*   Number of H atoms in cyclohexene (C6H10) = 10\n*   Number of H atoms in cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8) = 8\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Determine the chemical formula and structure of hydrocarbon Z.**\n\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n*   Let the chemical formula of Z be CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula: `mass % H = (y * Ar(H)) / (x * Ar(C) + y * Ar(H))`, where Ar is the atomic mass.\n*   Using Ar(H) ≈ 1 and Ar(C) ≈ 12: `0.1428 = y / (12x + y)`.\n*   The value 0.1428 is very close to 1/7. So, `1/7 = y / (12x + y)`.\n*   This gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n*   The empirical formula of Z is CH2, and its general formula is CnH2n.\n*   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen and is formed by the hydrogenation of other compounds. This means Z must be a saturated compound. A hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n that is saturated must be a cycloalkane.\n*   The problem also states that hydrogenation of both mixtures X and Y gives *only* one substance, Z. This implies that all the compounds in mixtures X and Y share the same carbon skeleton.\n*   As we will see later, the reaction involves benzene (C6H6). Hydrogenation of benzene produces cyclohexane (C6H12). This strongly suggests that the carbon skeleton is a six-membered ring.\n*   Therefore, Z must be cyclohexane, C6H12. Let's check the mass fraction of hydrogen in cyclohexane: `(12 * 1.008) / (6 * 12.011 + 12 * 1.008) = 12.096 / 84.162 ≈ 0.1437`, which is close enough to 14.28% considering rounding. The `y=2x` derivation is more definitive.\n*   Cyclohexane is also widely used as a solvent, which matches the description.\n\n**2. Determine the components of mixture Y.**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (let's call them C and D) that does not decolorize bromine water.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n*   Z (cyclohexane) is itself a constituent of mixture Y. So, let C = cyclohexane (C6H12).\n*   Cyclohexane is saturated and does not decolorize bromine water, which is consistent.\n*   The other component, D, must also hydrogenate to form cyclohexane. This means D must have a C6 ring skeleton.\n*   D must not decolorize bromine water. This rules out unsaturated compounds like cyclohexene or cyclohexadienes. This leaves saturated or aromatic compounds.\n*   Since D must be different from C (cyclohexane), the only plausible candidate is an aromatic compound: benzene (C6H6). Benzene does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions and can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane (C6H6 + 3H2 → C6H12).\n*   Therefore, mixture Y consists of equimolar amounts of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n**3. Determine the components of mixture X.**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (A and B) that is converted to mixture Y upon heating with platinum. The reaction is described as a disproportionation.\n*   The overall transformation is: Mixture X → Mixture Y.\n*   Since X and Y are equimolar mixtures, the reaction can be written as: `A + B → C + D`\n*   Substituting the components of Y, we get: `A + B → Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)`.\n*   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One molecule is hydrogenated (gains H) and another is dehydrogenated (loses H). The total number of C and H atoms must be conserved.\n*   Total atoms in products: C = 6+6=12, H = 12+6=18.\n*   Therefore, the two molecules A and B from mixture X must together contain 12 carbon atoms and 18 hydrogen atoms. Since they both have a C6 skeleton, their formulas must be C6Hx and C6Hy, where `x + y = 18`.\n*   Now let's use the properties of mixture X:\n    *   It decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and B must contain C=C double bonds.\n    *   There are no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   Hydrogenation of X gives only cyclohexane, confirming the C6 ring skeleton for both A and B.\n*   Let's identify possible structures for A and B. They must be unsaturated C6 ring compounds.\n    *   **Cyclohexene (C6H10)**: Contains one double bond, not conjugated. It decolorizes bromine water. This is a possible candidate. (Number of H = 10).\n    *   **1,3-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**: Contains two double bonds, but they are conjugated. The problem statement explicitly excludes this.\n    *   **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**: Contains two isolated (non-conjugated) double bonds. It decolorizes bromine water. This is a possible candidate. (Number of H = 8).\n*   Let's test the pair A = Cyclohexene (C6H10) and B = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n*   The total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. This matches the requirement from the reaction stoichiometry.\n*   All other conditions are met: equimolar mixture of two C6-ring liquids, both decolorize bromine water, no conjugated bonds, and the reaction `C6H10 + C6H8 → C6H12 + C6H6` represents a valid hydrogen transfer.\n\n**4. Calculate the final answer.**\n\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   This is the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of the first liquid (Cyclohexene, C6H10) and one molecule of the second liquid (1,4-Cyclohexadiene, C6H8).\n*   Total hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the molecular formula of hydrocarbon Z.**\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon that is the final product of hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen. This indicates that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon, which can be either an alkane (general formula CnH2n+2) or a cycloalkane (general formula CnH2n).\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is given as 14.28%. Let's test the general formulas using integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1) for simplicity, as is common in such problems.\n    *   For an alkane (CnH2n+2):\n        Mass % H = (Mass of H) / (Total Mass) = (2n + 2) / (12n + 2n + 2) = (2n + 2) / (14n + 2).\n        If we set this to 14.28% (which is approximately 1/7), we get:\n        (2n + 2) / (14n + 2) = 1/7\n        7 * (2n + 2) = 1 * (14n + 2)\n        14n + 14 = 14n + 2\n        14 = 2, which is a contradiction. Therefore, Z cannot be an alkane.\n    *   For a cycloalkane (CnH2n):\n        Mass % H = (Mass of H) / (Total Mass) = (2n) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 2/14 = 1/7.\n        1/7 ≈ 0.142857, which corresponds to 14.28%. This is a match.\n*   So, Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n. The problem also states that Z is \"widely used as a solvent\". The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane, which has the formula C6H12. This fits the general formula CnH2n for n=6. We can confidently identify Z as **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the components of mixture Y.**\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of mixture Y. So, one liquid in Y is cyclohexane (C6H12).\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane). Let the other liquid in Y be D.\n    *   Hydrogenation of cyclohexane gives cyclohexane (no reaction).\n    *   Hydrogenation of D must also give cyclohexane. This implies that D has the same six-carbon cyclic skeleton as cyclohexane.\n*   Since D does not decolorize bromine water, it cannot have any C=C double bonds in a ring or side chain. The only remaining possibility for a C6 cyclic compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane and doesn't react with bromine water is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene only reacts with Br2 in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst, not with aqueous bromine water.\n*   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the components of mixture X.**\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n*   X decolorizes bromine water, meaning both A and B contain one or more C=C double bonds.\n*   Heating X with platinum causes a disproportionation reaction to form Y. Disproportionation in this context is a hydrogen transfer reaction. The overall reaction is:\n    A + B → Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)\n*   Since the products have a C6 ring, and hydrogenation of X also yields only cyclohexane, both A and B must be C6 cyclic hydrocarbons.\n*   The reaction is a transfer of hydrogen atoms. Let's look at the atom balance. The products are C6H12 and C6H6. The reactants A and B must collectively have C12H18 (12 carbon atoms and 18 hydrogen atoms). Since A and B are both C6 compounds, their formulas must be C6Hx and C6Hy, where x + y = 18.\n*   A and B are unsaturated cyclic C6 hydrocarbons. The most common ones are cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n*   Let's check if their hydrogen counts sum to 18: 10 + 8 = 18. This fits perfectly.\n*   So, the components of mixture X are **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n*   The disproportionation reaction is:\n    C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (cyclohexadiene) --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)\n    In this reaction, cyclohexene is reduced to cyclohexane (gains 2H), and cyclohexadiene is oxidized to benzene (loses 2H). This is a valid hydrogen transfer.\n*   The final condition is that \"There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X\".\n    *   Cyclohexene has only one double bond, so there is no conjugation.\n    *   Cyclohexadiene has two isomers: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (which has conjugated double bonds) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (which has isolated, non-conjugated double bonds).\n    *   To satisfy the condition, the diene must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final answer.**\n*   Mixture X consists of two liquids: cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of cyclohexene = 10.\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of 1,4-cyclohexadiene = 8.\n*   The total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z.**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n    *   The general formula for a hydrocarbon is CxHy.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula: `%H = (mass of H) / (total mass) = (y * 1.008) / (x * 12.011 + y * 1.008)`.\n    *   Using approximate atomic masses (H=1, C=12): `0.1428 = y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   Rearranging the equation: `0.1428 * (12x + y) = y` -> `1.7136x + 0.1428y = y` -> `1.7136x = 0.8572y`.\n    *   The ratio `y/x = 1.7136 / 0.8572 ≈ 2`.\n    *   So, the empirical formula of Z is CH2, and the general molecular formula is CnH2n.\n    *   Hydrocarbons with the formula CnH2n are either alkenes or cycloalkanes.\n    *   The problem states that Z is formed by hydrogenation and \"does not react further with hydrogen\". This means Z is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Z is also described as a \"widely used as a solvent\". Cyclohexane (C6H12) is a very common cycloalkane solvent. Let's check its formula and H percentage:\n        *   Formula: C6H12. This fits CnH2n with n=6.\n        *   %H = (12 * 1) / (6 * 12 + 12) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%. This matches perfectly.\n    *   So, we can confidently identify **Z as Cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Hydrogenation Reactions.**\n    *   The problem states that hydrogenation of *both* mixture X (components A and B) and mixture Y (components C and D) under severe conditions gives *only* substance Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   This means that hydrogenation of each of the four substances (A, B, C, D) must yield cyclohexane.\n    *   `Hydrogenation(A) -> Cyclohexane`\n    *   `Hydrogenation(B) -> Cyclohexane`\n    *   `Hydrogenation(C) -> Cyclohexane`\n    *   `Hydrogenation(D) -> Cyclohexane`\n    *   This implies that all four substances A, B, C, and D must have the same carbon skeleton: a six-membered ring. Any side chains or different ring structures would yield different products upon hydrogenation. For example, hydrogenation of methylcyclopentane yields methylcyclopentane, not cyclohexane (though isomerization can occur under specific reforming conditions, the problem implies a common skeleton for all precursors).\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture Y and the Disproportionation Reaction.**\n    *   Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, C and D.\n    *   Y \"does not decolorize bromine water\". This means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of Y. Let's say **C = Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12)**. Cyclohexane is saturated and fits this description.\n    *   What is D? D must also have a C6 ring skeleton, and its hydrogenation must yield cyclohexane. It also must not decolorize bromine water. The most common chemical species that fits this description is **Benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene is aromatic and does not react with bromine water. Hydrogenation of benzene under severe conditions (high pressure/temperature) yields cyclohexane.\n    *   So, **Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of Cyclohexane (C6H12) and Benzene (C6H6)**.\n    *   This mixture Y is formed by a \"disproportionation\" reaction when mixture X is heated with platinum. Disproportionation in this context refers to a hydrogen transfer reaction. One molecule is reduced (gains hydrogen) and another is oxidized (loses hydrogen).\n    *   The reaction is: `Mixture X (A+B) -> Mixture Y (C+D)`\n    *   Substituting the identified compounds: `A + B -> Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)`.\n    *   Since Y is an equimolar mixture, the stoichiometry is 1:1.\n\n4.  **Identify the Components of Mixture X.**\n    *   The reaction is `A + B -> C6H12 + C6H6`. By conservation of atoms, the total composition of A+B must be C12H18.\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B. Both must have a C6-ring skeleton. So, A = C6Hx and B = C6Hy.\n    *   From `A+B = C12H18`, we have `x + y = 18`.\n    *   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds).\n    *   The problem states there are \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" in the molecules of X.\n    *   Let's consider possible unsaturated C6-ring molecules:\n        *   Cyclohexene (C6H10).

It has conjugated double bonds, so it is ruled out.\n    *   Let's test the combination of A = Cyclohexene and B = Cyclohexa-1,4-diene.\n    *   The sum of hydrogen atoms is `10 + 8 = 18`. This matches our requirement `x+y=18`.\n    *   The proposed disproportionation reaction is:\n        `C6H10 (Cyclohexene) + C6H8 (Cyclohexa-1,4-diene) --Pt, heat--> C6H12 (Cyclohexane) + C6H6 (Benzene)`\n    *   In this reaction, cyclohexene (C6H10) is reduced by gaining 2H to become cyclohexane (C6H12). Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8) is oxidized by losing 2H to become benzene (C6H6). This is a valid hydrogen transfer disproportionation.\n    *   Thus, **Mixture X consists of Cyclohexene (C6H10) and Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer.**\n    *   The question asks for the \"total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X\".\n    *   This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of the first liquid (Cyclohexene) and one molecule of the second liquid (Cyclohexa-1,4-diene).\n    *   Number of H atoms in Cyclohexene (C6H10) = 10.\n    *   Number of H atoms in Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8) = 8.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z.**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in a hydrocarbon CₓHᵧ is given by (y × Ar(H)) / (x × Ar(C) + y × Ar(H)), where Ar are the atomic weights.\n    *   Let's use approximate atomic weights for simplicity: Ar(H) ≈ 1 and Ar(C) ≈ 12.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%, which is very close to 1/7 (1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857).\n    *   So, we have the equation: y / (12x + y) = 1/7.\n    *   Rearranging this gives: 7y = 12x + y, which simplifies to 6y = 12x, or y = 2x.\n    *   This means the empirical formula of Z is CH₂, and the general formula is CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a saturated hydrocarbon. A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ that is saturated must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   We are also told that Z is widely used as a solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent that fits this description is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This is a very strong candidate for Z.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y.**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n    *   One of the components of Y is Z, which we've identified as cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). Let's call the other component B. So, Y = {Cyclohexane, B}.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means the hydrogenation of B must also yield cyclohexane.\n    *   This implies that B must also have a six-carbon skeleton.\n    *   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water. Cyclohexane is saturated and does not react. For B not to react with bromine water, it must either be saturated or aromatic (aromatic compounds like benzene do not react with bromine water without a catalyst).\n    *   Since B can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane, it cannot be saturated. Therefore, B must be an aromatic compound.\n    *   The aromatic compound with a six-carbon skeleton that hydrogenates to cyclohexane is **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n    *   So, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)** and **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction from Mixture X to Mixture Y.**\n    *   Mixture X, an equimolar mixture of two liquids (let's call them C and D), is heated with platinum to form mixture Y.\n    *   The reaction is described as a disproportionation. In this context, it's a hydrogen transfer reaction where one species is hydrogenated and another is dehydrogenated.\n    *   The reaction is: C + D → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆).\n    *   Since X is equimolar and Y is equimolar, the stoichiometry is 1:1 → 1:1.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane).

This is consistent with x < 12 and y < 12.\n    *   The problem states there are no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   A possible identity for mixture X could be cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n    *   In this case, x = 10 and y = 8. The sum x + y = 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   Cyclohexene has one double bond. 1,4-cyclohexadiene has two non-conjugated double bonds. Both would decolorize bromine water.\n    *   The reaction C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆ is a plausible hydrogen transfer, where cyclohexene is hydrogenated and 1,4-cyclohexadiene is dehydrogenated.\n    *   This confirms that our deduced value is consistent with the existence of such molecules.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n*   The mass fraction is given as a percentage, so 14.28% = 0.1428. This value is very close to 1/7 (1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857).\n*   Let's test the general formulas for hydrocarbons using simple integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1), as is common in such problems.\n    *   For an alkane (CnH2n+2): Mass fraction of H = (2n + 2) / (12n + 2n + 2) = (2n + 2) / (14n + 2). Setting this to 1/7 gives 7(2n + 2) = 14n + 2, which simplifies to 14n + 14 = 14n + 2, or 14 = 2, which is impossible.\n    *   For a cycloalkane (CnH2n): Mass fraction of H = (2n) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 2/14 = 1/7. This is a perfect match.\n*   So, Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n.\n*   Z is also described as being widely used as a solvent and fully saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\"). This is consistent with cycloalkanes like cyclopentane (C5H10), cyclohexane (C6H12), or methylcyclohexane (C7H14).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Composition of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water.\n*   Z is a constituent of Y. Let's call the components of Y, Y1 and Y2. So, Y1 = Z = CnH2n (a cycloalkane).\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z. This means hydrogenating Y2 must also produce Z.\n*   Y2 does not decolorize bromine water, which suggests it's saturated. However, a saturated compound typically does not react with hydrogen, unless it's a strained ring that undergoes hydrogenolysis (ring-opening). But if Y2 were a structural isomer of Z (e.g., methylcyclopentane vs. cyclohexane), hydrogenation would not convert one to the other; it would produce a different alkane.\n*   The exception for \"does not decolorize bromine water\" is an aromatic compound. Aromatic compounds like benzene (C6H6) and toluene (C7H8) do not react with bromine water under normal conditions but can be hydrogenated to their corresponding cycloalkanes under severe conditions.\n*   This leads to the hypothesis that Y2 is the aromatic analogue of Z.\n    *   Y = {CnH2n (cycloalkane Z), CnH2n-6 (aromatic compound)}.\n*   Let's check this hypothesis: Hydrogenation of CnH2n gives CnH2n. Hydrogenation of CnH2n-6 gives CnH2n. This is consistent with the fact that hydrogenating mixture Y gives only Z.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Composition of Mixture X and the Reaction**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2. They decolorize bromine water (they are unsaturated) and have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   Heating mixture X with platinum produces the equimolar mixture Y. This suggests a 1:1 reaction stoichiometry: X1 + X2 → Y1 + Y2.\n*   The reaction is a hydrogen transfer (described as a \"disproportionation\"). One component of X is reduced to the cycloalkane (Y1=Z), and the other is oxidized to the aromatic compound (Y2).\n    X1 + X2 → CnH2n + CnH2n-6\n*   Since all compounds (X1, X2, Y1, Y2) must lead to Z upon hydrogenation, they must all share the same carbon skeleton.\n*   Let's balance the hydrogen atoms in the reaction:\n    Total H in reactants = Total H in products\n    H(X1) + H(X2) = (2n) + (2n - 6) = 4n - 6.\n*   What could X1 and X2 be? They are unsaturated versions of Z. The most likely candidates are a cycloalkene (CnH2n-2) and a cyclodiene (CnH2n-4).\n    *   Let X1 = CnH2n-2 (cycloalkene).\n    *   Let X2 = CnH2n-4 (cyclodiene).\n*   The reaction becomes:\n    CnH2n-2 (X1, reduced) + 2[H] → CnH2n (Y1)\n    CnH2n-4 (X2, oxidized) → CnH2n-6 (Y2) + 2[H]\n    Overall: CnH2n-2 + CnH2n-4 → CnH2n + CnH2n-6.\n*   The hydrogen count for the proposed reactants is (2n - 2) + (2n - 4) = 4n - 6. This matches the product hydrogen count. The model is consistent.\n*   The problem states X has no conjugated bonds, so the cyclodiene (X2) must be a non-conjugated isomer (e.g., a 1,4-diene, not a 1,3-diene).\n\n**Step 4: Distinguish Between Possible Scenarios and Find the Answer**\n\n*   We have a general formula for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X: **Total H = 4n - 6**.\n*   We need to find the value of 'n'. Common cycloalkane solvents suggest n=5, 6, or 7.\n    *   If n=5 (cyclopentane), the aromatic product C5H(10-6)=C5H4 does not correspond to a stable, common liquid. This case is unlikely.\n    *   If n=6 (cyclohexane), Z=C6H12. The aromatic is benzene (C6H6). X would be cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). Total H = 4*6 - 6 = 18.\n    *   If n=7 (methylcyclohexane), Z=C7H14. The aromatic is toluene (C7H8). X would be a methylcyclohexene (C7H12) and a non-conjugated methylcyclohexadiene (C7H10). Total H = 4*7 - 6 = 22.\n\n*   Both scenarios (n=6 and n=7) are chemically plausible and lead to answers present in the options (A=22, D=18). We must find a way to distinguish them.\n*   The problem is likely constructed around the most fundamental and common textbook example of such a chemical transformation. The system involving cyclohexane, cyclohexene, cyclohexadiene, and benzene (the C6 system) is the archetypal example of catalytic hydrogen transfer reactions. The C7 system is a valid homologue, but less fundamental. In the absence of further distinguishing information, it is most probable that the question refers to the C6 system.\n\n**Step 5: Final Calculation**\n\n*   Assuming the intended scenario is n=6:\n    *   Mixture X consists of cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each of these two liquids is: 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThe reasoning is as follows:\n\n1.  **Determine the identity of hydrocarbon Z.**\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%, which is equivalent to 14.28/100 ≈ 1/7.\n    *   Let the molecular formula of the hydrocarbon be CₓHᵧ.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula: (mass of H) / (total mass) = (1.008 * y) / (12.01 * x + 1.008 * y).\n    *   Using approximate atomic masses (H=1, C=12), we get: y / (12x + y) = 1/7.\n    *   This simplifies to 7y = 12x + y, which gives 6y = 12x, or y = 2x.\n    *   The general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ. This formula can represent an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂. This fits the formula CₙH₂ₙ (with n=6) and all other descriptions. So, Z is cyclohexane.\n\n2.  **Determine the composition of mixture Y.**\n    *   Mixture Y is formed by the disproportionation of mixture X.\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water (meaning they are saturated or aromatic).\n    *   Substance Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂) is a constituent of mixture Y.\n    *   The reaction X → Y is a disproportionation on a platinum catalyst. For cyclic C₆ compounds, this is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One molecule is hydrogenated (gains H), and another is dehydrogenated (loses H).\n    *   Since one product is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), the fully hydrogenated product, the other product must be the fully dehydrogenated C₆ ring, which is benzene (C₆H₆).\n    *   Benzene is aromatic and does not decolorize bromine water.\n    *   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆).\n\n3.  **Relate mixture X to mixture Y.**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (let's call them A and B) that undergoes disproportionation to form mixture Y.\n    *   The reaction is: A + B → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆.\n    *   By the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms on the reactant side must equal the total number of atoms on the product side.\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B.\n\n4.  **Calculate the total number of hydrogen atoms.**\n    *   Total H atoms in reactants (A + B) = Total H atoms in products (cyclohexane + benzene).\n    *   Total H atoms = (Number of H in C₆H₁₂) + (Number of H in C₆H₆).\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Hydrocarbon Z**\n    *   The problem states that hydrocarbon Z has a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   Let the molecular formula of Z be CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula: `(y * AtomicMass(H)) / (x * AtomicMass(C) + y * AtomicMass(H))`.\n    *   Using atomic masses C ≈ 12 and H ≈ 1, we get: `y / (12x + y) = 0.1428`.\n    *   The value 14.28% is very close to 1/7. Let's test this: `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`.\n    *   This gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n    *   So, the empirical formula of Z is CH2, and its molecular formula is CnH2n.\n    *   The problem also states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a saturated hydrocarbon. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Z is a constituent of mixture Y. So, one component of Y is the cycloalkane Z (CnH2n).\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only Z. Let the other component of Y be Y'.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Z (CnH2n) gives Z itself, as it's already saturated.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y' must also yield Z (CnH2n). For this to happen, Y' must have the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n    *   If Y' were another saturated compound (like an isomer of Z), hydrogenation would not convert it to Z (it might cause ring-opening to an acyclic alkane, but that would result in a different product).\n    *   The most plausible candidate for Y' is an aromatic hydrocarbon. Aromatic hydrocarbons do not decolorize bromine water and can be hydrogenated to the corresponding cycloalkane.\n    *   A monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with n carbon atoms has the general formula CnH(2n-6) (e.g., benzene C6H6, toluene C7H8).\n    *   So, mixture Y consists of Z (CnH2n) and an aromatic hydrocarbon (CnH(2n-6)). Hydrogenating this mixture would convert the aromatic part to CnH2n, resulting in a single product, Z. This fits all the conditions.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Disproportionation Reaction**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2. They decolorize bromine water, so they are unsaturated (contain C=C bonds). They have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   The conversion of X to Y is a disproportionation reaction upon heating with a platinum catalyst. This is characteristic of a catalytic hydrogen transfer reaction.\n    *   The reaction is: `X1 + X2 -> Y1 + Y2`. Since the starting mixture X and product mixture Y are both equimolar, this is a 1:1 reaction.\n    *   Substituting the formulas for the components of Y: `X1 + X2 -> CnH2n + CnH(2n-6)`.\n    *   By conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in X1 and X2 must equal the total in Y1 and Y2. Let X1 be CnHx and X2 be CnH(y). Then `x + y = (2n) + (2n-6) = 4n - 6`.\n    *   Hydrogenation of both X1 and X2 gives only Z (CnH2n). This means X1 and X2 are unsaturated hydrocarbons with the same n-carbon skeleton as Z.\n    *   The most logical candidates for X1 and X2 are the corresponding cycloalkene (CnH(2n-2)) and a non-conjugated cycloalkadiene (CnH(2n-4)).\n    *   Let's check if these fit the hydrogen balance: `(2n-2) + (2n-4) = 4n - 6`. This matches perfectly.\n    *   The reaction is a hydrogen transfer: the cycloalkadiene (CnH(2n-4)) loses 2 hydrogen atoms to become the aromatic compound (CnH(2n-6)), and the cycloalkene (CnH(2n-2)) gains these 2 hydrogen atoms to become the cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n\n4.  **Determine the Value of 'n' and the Final Answer**\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is the sum of hydrogens in CnH(2n-2) and CnH(2n-4), which is `4n - 6`.\n    *   Now we need to find 'n'. The problem states Z is a \"widely used solvent\". Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclohexane (n=6) and methylcyclohexane (n=7).\n    *   Let's test the possible answers, which represent the total number of hydrogen atoms (4n-6):\n        *   If Total H = 18 (Option A): `18 = 4n - 6` => `4n = 24` => `n = 6`. This corresponds to Z being cyclohexane. The components of X would be cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). The sum of H atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. This is a valid solution.\n        *   If Total H = 22 (Option C): `22 = 4n - 6` => `4n = 28` => `n = 7`. This corresponds to Z being methylcyclohexane. The components of X would be a methylcyclohexene (C7H12) and a non-conjugated methylcyclohexadiene (C7H10). The sum of H atoms is 12 + 10 = 22. This is also a chemically plausible solution.\n        *   The other options, 12 and 16, do not yield integer values for 'n'.\n    *   We have two plausible scenarios (n=6 and n=7). However, the set of reactions described (hydrogen transfer between a diene and an alkene to yield an aromatic and an alkane) is a classic textbook example in organic chemistry, almost always illustrated with the C6 system (cyclohexane/benzene). Given the context of such a problem, the most fundamental and common example is the intended answer.\n    *   Therefore, we conclude that n=6.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n    *   The system is based on C6 hydrocarbons.\n    *   Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    *   Y = {Cyclohexane (C6H12), Benzene (C6H6)}.\n    *   X = {Cyclohexene (C6H10), 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)}.\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is the sum of hydrogens in one molecule of cyclohexene and one molecule of 1,4-cyclohexadiene.\n    *   Total H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the chemistry problem.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon, let's denote its formula as CxHy.\n*   It is saturated because it does not react further with hydrogen.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given as 14.28%. This value is very close to 1/7 (100/7 ≈ 14.2857%). In chemistry problems, this often suggests using integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1) for calculation.\n*   Let's verify this. The mass percentage of hydrogen in a hydrocarbon CnHm is (m * 1) / (12n + m). If the formula is of the type CnH2n (cycloalkanes or alkenes), the percentage of H is (2n) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%.\n*   Since Z is saturated, it cannot be an alkene. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane with the general formula CnH2n.\n*   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclopentane (C5H10), cyclohexane (C6H12), and methylcyclohexane (C7H14). All fit the CnH2n formula.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, Z and another compound D.\n*   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water. Since Z (a cycloalkane) does not react with bromine water, D must also not react.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z. This means that the hydrogenation of D must yield Z.\n*   This implies that D has the same carbon skeleton as Z and is unsaturated. For D to not decolorize bromine water, it must be an aromatic compound. Standard aromatic compounds like benzene and toluene do not react with bromine water without a catalyst.\n*   Let's check our potential candidates for Z:\n    *   If Z = Cyclopentane (C5H10), D would need to be a stable C5 aromatic hydrocarbon. None exist (cyclopentadienyl anion is aromatic, but not a neutral hydrocarbon). So, n=5 is ruled out.\n    *   If Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12), D would be Benzene (C6H6). Benzene does not decolorize bromine water and hydrogenates to cyclohexane under severe conditions. This is a valid case.\n    *   If Z = Methylcyclohexane (C7H14), D would be Toluene (C7H8). Toluene does not decolorize bromine water and hydrogenates to methylcyclohexane. This is also a valid case.\n    *   If Z = Cyclooctane (C8H16), D would be Cyclooctatetraene (C8H8). Cyclooctatetraene is not aromatic in the same way as benzene and behaves like a polyene, readily decolorizing bromine water. Thus, n=8 is ruled out.\n*   So, the problem is narrowed down to two possibilities: the C6 system or the C7 system.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Components of Mixture X and the Reaction**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B.\n*   X decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and B are unsaturated (containing C=C or C≡C bonds).\n*   Hydrogenation of X gives only Z. This means both A and B must have the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n*   The molecules in X have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   The reaction from X to Y is a disproportionation that occurs on heated platinum. In this context, it refers to a catalytic hydrogen transfer. The most plausible scenario that results in an equimolar mixture Y from an equimolar mixture X is a specific combination of reactants undergoing Zelinsky disproportionation.\n*   Let's analyze the general stoichiometry of this reaction for a cycloalkene CnH(2n-2) (one double bond, k=1) and a cycloalkadiene CnH(2n-4) (two double bonds, k=2), which both yield a cycloalkane CnH2n (Z) and an aromatic compound CnH(2n-6) (D).\n    *   For a cycloalkene (k=1): 3 CnH(2n-2) → 2 CnH2n + 1 CnH(2n-6)\n    *   For a cycloalkadiene (k=2): 3 CnH(2n-4) → 1 CnH2n + 2 CnH(2n-6)\n*   If we start with an equimolar mixture of A (the cycloalkene) and B (the cycloalkadiene), say 3 moles of each, the total products will be:\n    *   From A: 2 moles of Z + 1 mole of D\n    *   From B: 1 mole of Z + 2 moles of D\n    *   Total: (2+1) = 3 moles of Z and (1+2) = 3 moles of D.\n*   This combination produces an equimolar mixture of Z and D, perfectly matching the problem description.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the C6 and C7 Cases and Find the Solution**\n\n*   **Case 1: The C6 System**\n    *   Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12)\n    *   D = Benzene (C6H6)\n    *   A = Cyclohexene (C6H10)\n    *   B = A non-conjugated cyclohexadiene. The only one is Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8).\n    *   This system fits all conditions. The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n*   **Case 2: The C7 System**\n    *   Z = Methylcyclohexane (C7H14)\n    *   D = Toluene (C7H8)\n    *   A = A methylcyclohexene (C7H12).\n    *   B = A non-conjugated methylcyclohexadiene (e.g., 1-methylcyclohexa-2,5-diene, C7H10).\n    *   This system also fits all conditions. The total number of hydrogen atoms would be 12 + 10 = 22.\n\n*   **Distinguishing Between C6 and C7**\n    *   Both cases are chemically plausible and consistent with all the statements. However, chemistry problems of this type usually have a unique solution. The C6 system (cyclohexane/benzene) is the parent, unsubstituted, and most classic textbook example of Zelinsky disproportionation. In the absence of further information, it is the most reasonable interpretation of \"a certain hydrocarbon Z\". The problem is likely designed around this fundamental example.\n\n**Step 5: Final Calculation**\n\nBased on the conclusion that the C6 system is the intended subject of the problem:\n*   Liquid A is Cyclohexene (C6H10).\n*   Liquid B is Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8).\n*   The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X (one molecule of each) is the sum of hydrogen atoms in A and B.\n*   Total H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z.**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is `(y * 1) / (x * 12 + y * 1)`.\n    *   14.28% is very close to 1/7. So, `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`.\n    *   This gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n    *   The general formula for Z is CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states that Z is formed by hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen. A CnH2n formula can represent an alkene or a cycloalkane. Since it's saturated (doesn't react with H2), it must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Z is also described as a liquid widely used as a solvent. The most common cycloalkane that fits this description is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n    *   Let's check the mass fraction for cyclohexane: H% = (12 * 1.008) / (6 * 12.011 + 12 * 1.008) = 12.096 / (72.066 + 12.096) = 12.096 / 84.162 ≈ 0.1437, which is consistent with the given 14.28%. Using integer masses: 12 / (6*12 + 12) = 12/84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%.\n    *   So, **Z is cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n2.  **Identify the components of Mixture Y.**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated.\n    *   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of Y. Let's call the components Y1 and Y2. So, Y1 = cyclohexane.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   This means hydrogenation of Y1 gives cyclohexane (which is true, as it's already cyclohexane).\n    *   And hydrogenation of Y2 gives cyclohexane. Since Y2 is saturated, this reaction must be an isomerization under severe hydrogenation conditions (e.g., high temperature and pressure with a Pt catalyst).\n    *   Y2 must be a saturated C6H12 isomer of cyclohexane. The most common and stable liquid isomer is **methylcyclopentane (C6H12)**. Isomerization of methylcyclopentane to cyclohexane is a known industrial process.\n    *   Therefore, **Mixture Y = {cyclohexane, methylcyclopentane}**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the reaction from X to Y.**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two unsaturated liquids, let's call them C and D. X has no conjugated bonds.\n    *   The reaction X → Y is a disproportionation on a heated platinum catalyst.\n    *   A disproportionation of cyclic unsaturated hydrocarbons over platinum typically involves hydrogen transfer, yielding a more saturated (reduced) species and a more unsaturated (oxidized) species.\n    *   The products in mixture Y (cyclohexane, methylcyclopentane) are fully saturated. This implies they are the reduced products. The oxidized product is not mentioned as part of Y, so it must be a co-product. For C6 cyclic systems, the ultimate oxidation product is benzene (C6H6).\n    *   The overall process can be described as: Mixture X → Mixture Y + Benzene.\n    *   `Mixture {C, D} --(Pt, heat)--> Mixture {cyclohexane, methylcyclopentane} + Benzene`\n\n4.  **Identify the components of Mixture X.**\n    *   The components of X, C and D, must be the precursors to the components of Y.\n    *   Hydrogenation of X gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n        *   H2 + C → cyclohexane. This means C must be an unsaturated C6 hydrocarbon with a six-membered ring skeleton (e.g., cyclohexene or cyclohexadiene).\n        *   H2 + D → cyclohexane. This means D must be an unsaturated C6 hydrocarbon whose skeleton can be hydrogenated and rearranged to a six-membered ring. The most logical precursor for methylcyclopentane (from Y) that also ultimately yields cyclohexane is an unsaturated version of methylcyclopentane (e.g., methylcyclopentene or methylcyclopentadiene).\n    *   Let C = C6Hy and D = C6Hq.\n    *   The reaction consumes C and D in a 1:1 molar ratio (since X is equimolar) and produces cyclohexane and methylcyclopentane in a 1:1 molar ratio (since Y is equimolar).\n    *   Let's write a general balanced equation for the reaction. Let `a` be the coefficient for C and D, `p` for the products in Y, and `r` for benzene.\n        `a C + a D → p cyclohexane + p methylcyclopentane + r benzene`\n    *   Substituting the formulas:\n        `a C6Hy + a C6Hq → p C6H12 + p C6H12 + r C6H6`\n    *   Balancing the carbon atoms:\n        `6a + 6a = 6p + 6p + 6r`\n        `12a = 12p + 6r`\n        `2a = 2p + r` (Equation 1)\n    *   Balancing the hydrogen atoms:\n        `a*y + a*q = 12p + 12p + 6r`\n        `a(y + q) = 24p + 6r` (Equation 2)\n    *   Now we must determine `y` and `q`. C must be cyclohexene (C6H10) or a cyclohexadiene (C6H8). The problem states no conjugated bonds, so 1,3-cyclohexadiene is out, but **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)** is a possibility. D must be an unsaturated version of methylcyclopentane, like **methylcyclopentene (C6H10)**.\n    *   Let's test the hypothesis: **C = 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)** and **D = methylcyclopentene (C6H10)**.\n    *   So, `y = 8` and `q = 10`.\n    *   Substitute `y` and `q` into Equation 2:\n        `a(8 + 10) = 24p + 6r`\n        `18a = 24p + 6r`\n        `3a = 4p + r` (Equation 2, simplified)\n    *   Now we solve the system of two equations:\n        1) `2a = 2p + r`\n        2) `3a = 4p + r`\n    *   From (1), `r = 2a - 2p`. Substitute this into (2):\n        `3a = 4p + (2a - 2p)`\n        `3a = 2p + 2a`\n        `a = 2p`\n    *   This gives a simple integer ratio for the coefficients `a` and `p`. If we choose `p=1`, then `a=2`.\n    *   The reaction stoichiometry is: `2 C6H8 + 2 C6H10 → 1 C6H12 + 1 C6H12 + r C6H6`. The 2:2 ratio for reactants confirms they can be an equimolar mixture. The 1:1 ratio for products confirms Y is an equimolar mixture. This model is consistent.\n    *   The two liquids in mixture X are 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) and methylcyclopentene (C6H10).\n\n5.  **Calculate the final answer.**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n    *   Number of H atoms in 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) = 8.\n    *   Number of H atoms in methylcyclopentene (C6H10) = 10.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 8 + 10 = 18.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon, so its formula is CxHy.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is given as 14.28%, which is equivalent to 0.1428.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen can be expressed as: Mass Fraction (H) = (y * Ar(H)) / (x * Ar(C) + y * Ar(H)), where Ar(H) ≈ 1 and Ar(C) ≈ 12.\n*   So, 0.1428 ≈ y / (12x + y).\n*   Rearranging this gives: 1 / 0.1428 ≈ (12x + y) / y => 7.00 ≈ 12x/y + 1 => 6 ≈ 12x/y => y/x ≈ 2.\n*   This suggests an empirical formula of CH2.\n*   The general formula for a hydrocarbon with a y/x ratio of 2 is CnH2n.\n*   The problem states that Z is formed by hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a saturated hydrocarbon.\n*   Saturated hydrocarbons are alkanes (CnH2n+2) or cycloalkanes (CnH2n).\n*   The formula CnH2n corresponds to a cycloalkane. The mass fraction of hydrogen in any cycloalkane is (2n * 1) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857, which matches the given value perfectly.\n*   So, Z is a cycloalkane. The problem also states that Z is widely used as a solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane (C6H12). Let's assume Z is cyclohexane. This is consistent with all the information.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water.\n*   Mixture Y is formed by the disproportionation of mixture X. A disproportionation reaction in this context involves hydrogen transfer, where some molecules are hydrogenated (gain H) and others are dehydrogenated (lose H).\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane, C6H12).\n*   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of mixture Y. So, one component of Y is cyclohexane (C6H12).\n*   Let the other component of Y be Y2. Hydrogenation of Y2 must also give cyclohexane. This means Y2 must have a C6 ring skeleton.\n*   Since Y is the product of disproportionation, and one product (cyclohexane) is the fully hydrogenated C6 ring, the other product (Y2) must be the dehydrogenated C6 ring. The ultimate dehydrogenated C6 ring is benzene (C6H6).\n*   Let's check if Y = {cyclohexane (C6H12), benzene (C6H6)} fits the description.\n    *   **Equimolar mixture of two liquids:** Yes, both are liquids at room temperature.\n    *   **Does not decolorize bromine water:** Correct. Cyclohexane is saturated. Benzene's aromatic ring is stable and does not react with bromine water in an addition reaction.\n    *   **Hydrogenation gives only Z:** Correct. Hydrogenation of benzene yields cyclohexane. Hydrogenation of cyclohexane yields itself. So the only product is cyclohexane (Z).\n*   Therefore, mixture Y consists of cyclohexane and benzene.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms in Mixture X**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2.\n*   Mixture X undergoes a disproportionation reaction upon heating with platinum to form the equimolar mixture Y.\n*   The reaction can be written as: X1 + X2 → Y1 + Y2\n*   Substituting the components of Y, we get: X1 + X2 → Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6).\n*   Since the hydrogenation of mixture X also gives only cyclohexane, the components X1 and X2 must also be C6 compounds with a six-membered ring skeleton. Let their formulas be C6Hn and C6Hm.\n*   The reaction is: C6Hn + C6Hm → C6H12 + C6H6.\n*   According to the law of conservation of mass, the number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the reaction. Let's balance the hydrogen atoms:\n    *   Total H atoms on the left = n + m\n    *   Total H atoms on the right = 12 + 6 = 18\n*   Therefore, n + m = 18.\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is the sum of the hydrogen atoms in one molecule of X1 and one molecule of X2, which is n + m.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18. This corresponds to option C.\n\n*(For completeness, a plausible identity for mixture X would be cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). Neither has conjugated bonds. The total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. The disproportionation reaction C6H10 + C6H8 → C6H12 + C6H6 is balanced and chemically reasonable.)*\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z.**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let its formula be CxHy.\n    *   The mass fraction of H is `(y * AtomicMass(H)) / (x * AtomicMass(C) + y * AtomicMass(H))`.\n    *   Using integer atomic masses (H=1, C=12), the mass fraction is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   14.28% is approximately 0.142857, which is equal to 1/7.\n    *   So, `y / (12x + y) = 1/7` => `7y = 12x + y` => `6y = 12x` => `y = 2x`.\n    *   The empirical formula of Z is CH2, and its molecular formula is CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a saturated compound. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclohexane (C6H12), methylcyclohexane (C7H14), etc. Both fit the CnH2n formula.\n\n2.  **Identify the Carbon Skeleton.**\n    *   Mixture X (containing two liquids, A and B) and mixture Y (containing two liquids, C and D) can both be hydrogenated under severe conditions to produce *only* substance Z.\n    *   This is a crucial piece of information. It means that all four compounds (A, B, C, D) and Z share the same carbon skeleton. For example, if Z is cyclohexane, then A, B, C, and D must all be compounds with a six-membered carbon ring.\n\n3.  **Identify Mixture Y.**\n    *   Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This indicates that its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Z is a constituent of mixture Y. So, one component of Y is the cycloalkane Z.\n    *   The other component of Y must also have the same carbon skeleton and be saturated or aromatic. For its hydrogenation to also yield Z, it must be an aromatic compound corresponding to Z.\n    *   Let's assume the simplest case for the carbon skeleton, a 6-membered ring. This makes Z **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n    *   The corresponding aromatic compound is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions. Hydrogenation of benzene (C6H6 + 3H2) yields cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    *   So, Mixture Y = {**Benzene (C6H6)**, **Cyclohexane (C6H12)**}. This fits all the descriptions for Y.\n\n4.  **Identify Mixture X and the Reaction.**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B, which decolorizes bromine water (so they are unsaturated) and has no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   X is converted to Y upon heating with a platinum catalyst. The reaction is described as a disproportionation.\n    *   Since an equimolar mixture X yields an equimolar mixture Y, the reaction is most likely an intermolecular hydrogen transfer with 1:1 stoichiometry: A + B → C + D.\n    *   In our case: A + B → Benzene (C6H6) + Cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    *   This is a redox reaction where one molecule is oxidized (loses hydrogen) to form benzene, and the other is reduced (gains hydrogen) to form cyclohexane.\n        *   Oxidation: A → C6H6\n        *   Reduction: B → C6H12\n    *   A and B must be unsaturated C6 ring compounds. Possible candidates are cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexadienes (C6H8).\n    *   The total number of atoms must balance: Formula(A) + Formula(B) = C6H6 + C6H12 = C12H18.\n    *   If we choose A = **cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)** and B = **cyclohexene (C6H10)**, the sum is C12H18.\n    *   Let's check the hydrogen transfer:\n        *   C6H8 → C6H6 + 2H (loses 2 hydrogen atoms)\n        *   C6H10 + 2H → C6H12 (gains 2 hydrogen atoms)\n        *   The hydrogen transfer is balanced.\n    *   Let's check the final conditions for X:\n        *   Are they liquids? Yes (BP of cyclohexene is 83°C, cyclohexa-1,4-diene is 26°C).\n        *   Do they decolorize bromine water? Yes, both have double bonds.\n        *   Are there conjugated multiple bonds? Cyclohexene has one double bond. Cyclohexa-1,4-diene has two double bonds separated by two single bonds, so they are not conjugated. This condition is satisfied.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer.**\n    *   Mixture X consists of two liquids: Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8) and Cyclohexene (C6H10).\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   Number of H atoms in one molecule of C6H8 = 8.\n    *   Number of H atoms in one molecule of C6H10 = 10.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 8 + 10 = 18.\n\nThis solution is consistent with all the facts presented in the problem. The C7 case (involving toluene and methylcyclohexane) also appears consistent, leading to an answer of 22. However, the C6 case represents the simplest and most fundamental chemical system that fits the description, and it is common for such problems to refer to the parent system unless specified otherwise.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms is 18.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance Z**\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula: `mass % H = (mass of H in molecule) / (total molar mass of molecule)`.\n*   Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CnHm. The molar mass is approximately `12n + m`. The mass of hydrogen is `m`.\n*   So, `m / (12n + m) ≈ 0.1428`.\n*   The fraction 1/7 is equal to `0.142857...`, which is a very close match.\n*   Let's test this: `m / (12n + m) = 1/7`\n    *   `7m = 12n + m`\n    *   `6m = 12n`\n    *   `m = 2n`\n*   So, the general formula for substance Z is CnH2n. This formula corresponds to either an alkene (with one double bond) or a cycloalkane.\n*   The problem states that Z is formed by hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z must be a saturated compound. Therefore, Z cannot be an alkene and must be a cycloalkane.\n*   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. Let's check if n=6 fits. If n=6, m=2*6=12. The formula is C6H12. This is cyclohexane.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Carbon Skeleton of All Compounds**\n*   The problem states that hydrogenation of *both* mixture X and mixture Y under severe conditions gives *only* substance Z (cyclohexane, C6H12).\n*   This is a crucial piece of information. It means that all components in both mixtures X and Y are based on a six-carbon ring skeleton. Any other skeleton (like methylcyclopentane or linear hexanes) would not hydrogenate to cyclohexane.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n*   One of the components is substance Z, which we identified as **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n*   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated or aromatic. Cyclohexane is saturated.\n*   Mixture Y is formed from mixture X by a \"disproportionation\" reaction on a platinum catalyst when heated. Platinum is a classic catalyst for hydrogenation and dehydrogenation. Disproportionation in this context refers to a hydrogen transfer reaction where some molecules are hydrogenated and others are dehydrogenated.\n*   Since one component of Y is cyclohexane (the fully hydrogenated C6 ring), the other component must be the product of dehydrogenation. The ultimate, stable product of dehydrogenating a C6 ring is **benzene (C6H6)**.\n*   Let's check if benzene fits the description. It is a liquid. It is aromatic and does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions. It has a C6 ring skeleton.\n*   Therefore, Mixture Y consists of equimolar amounts of **benzene (C6H6)** and **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Reaction and Identify Components of Mixture X**\n*   The reaction is the conversion of mixture X to mixture Y.\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of benzene (C) and cyclohexane (D).\n*   Since the starting mixture (X) and the final mixture (Y) are both equimolar, the reaction stoichiometry must be 1:1 -> 1:1.\n    *   `A + B --(Pt, heat)--> C + D`\n    *   `A + B --> C6H6 + C6H12`\n*   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component of X (e.g., A) is dehydrogenated to form benzene, while the other component (B) is hydrogenated to form cyclohexane.\n*   The law of conservation of mass must apply. Specifically, the total number of hydrogen atoms on the left side of the equation must equal the total number on the right side.\n*   Number of H atoms in products = (H atoms in one molecule of benzene) + (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane)\n    *   = 6 + 12\n    *   = 18\n*   Therefore, the number of H atoms in the reactants must also be 18.\n*   Number of H atoms in reactants = (H atoms in one molecule of A) + (H atoms in one molecule of B) = 18.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of the number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each of the two liquids.\n*   Based on our analysis, this sum is 18.\n\n*For completeness, let's propose the identities of A and B:*\n*   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, so A and B must be unsaturated (contain C=C bonds).\n*   They must have a C6 ring skeleton.\n*   They must not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   Their total hydrogen count must be 18.\n*   A plausible pair is **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n    *   Sum of H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   Both are alkenes and will decolorize bromine water.\n    *   1,4-cyclohexadiene is non-conjugated (unlike its 1,3-isomer).\n    *   In the reaction, the diene (C6H8) can be dehydrogenated to benzene (C6H6), releasing 2 H atoms. The alkene (C6H10) can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane (C6H12), consuming 2 H atoms. The hydrogen transfer is balanced. This is a consistent solution.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon that is fully saturated (does not react further with hydrogen). This means it is an alkane (CnH2n+2) or a cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. Let's determine the formula of Z.\n    *   The mass fraction of Hydrogen (H) in a hydrocarbon (CxHy) is given by:\n        Mass % H = (y * AtomicMass(H)) / (x * AtomicMass(C) + y * AtomicMass(H)) * 100%\n    *   Using approximate atomic masses (C=12, H=1):\n        For an alkane (CnH2n+2): Mass % H = (2n+2) / (12n + 2n+2) = (2n+2) / (14n+2). As n gets larger, this approaches 2/14 = 1/7 ≈ 14.3%.\n        For a cycloalkane (CnH2n): Mass % H = (2n) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 14.2857%.\n    *   The value 14.28% is an excellent match for 1/7, which corresponds to the general formula CnH2n. Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z is widely used as a solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. Let's assume Z is cyclohexane.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, C and D.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y gives only substance Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   Z (cyclohexane) is itself a component of Y. Let's say C = Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    *   Since hydrogenation of Y gives only cyclohexane, the other component, D, must also hydrogenate to cyclohexane. This means D must have a 6-carbon ring skeleton.\n    *   Since D does not decolorize bromine water, it must be saturated or aromatic. It cannot be cyclohexane (since C and D are different). The only remaining possibility for a C6-ring structure is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene does not react with bromine water and is hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n    *   So, **Mixture Y = Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)**. This fits all the conditions.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Reaction**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B.\n    *   X is converted to Y by treatment with platinum when heated in a disproportionation reaction. Disproportionation here implies a hydrogen transfer reaction.\n        `A + B --(Pt, heat)--> C + D`\n        `A + B --(Pt, heat)--> Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)`\n    *   This is a hydrogen transfer: one reactant is oxidized (loses H) to form benzene, and the other is reduced (gains H) to form cyclohexane.\n    *   By conservation of atoms, the total number of carbon and hydrogen atoms must be the same on both sides of the reaction.\n        Total atoms in products = (C6H12 + C6H6) = C12H18.\n        Therefore, total atoms in reactants = A + B = C12H18.\n    *   The problem states that hydrogenation of mixture X (A and B) gives *only* one substance, Z (cyclohexane). This implies that both A and B have the same carbon skeleton: a 6-carbon ring.\n    *   So, A must be C6Hx and B must be C6Hy.\n    *   From the atom balance, we have x + y = 18.\n\n4.  **Identify Liquids in Mixture X**\n    *   We need to find two different C6-ring molecules, A and B, where the sum of their hydrogen atoms is 18.\n    *   The reaction is: `C6Hx + C6Hy -> C6H12 + C6H6`.\n        One molecule is oxidized to benzene (C6H6), and the other is reduced to cyclohexane (C6H12). For example:\n        `C6Hx -> C6H6 + (x-6)H` (oxidation)\n        `C6Hy + (12-y)H -> C6H12` (reduction)\n        For the hydrogen transfer to balance, `x-6 = 12-y`, which simplifies to `x+y = 18`. This confirms our previous finding.\n    *   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, meaning both A and B must be unsaturated (contain C=C bonds).\n    *   The problem also states there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of mixture X.\n    *   Let's consider possible unsaturated C6-ring structures:\n        *   Cyclohexene (C6H10)\n        *   Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)\n    *   Let's try the combination: A = C6H10 and B = C6H8. The sum of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. This works.\n    *   Let's check the structures and conditions:\n        *   A = **Cyclohexene (C6H10)**. It has one double bond, so it is unsaturated and has no conjugated bonds.\n        *   B = **Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**. There are two isomers: cyclohexa-1,3-diene (conjugated) and cyclohexa-1,4-diene (non-conjugated). The problem specifies no conjugated bonds, so B must be **cyclohexa-1,4-diene**.\n    *   This pair of molecules, cyclohexene and cyclohexa-1,4-diene, fits all the conditions described for mixture X.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of liquid A and one molecule of liquid B.\n    *   Liquid A = Cyclohexene (C6H10). Number of H atoms = 10.\n    *   Liquid B = Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8). Number of H atoms = 8.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon, a product of hydrogenation, and does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (an alkane or a cycloalkane).\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. Let's determine the empirical formula.\n    *   14.28% is very close to 14.2857%, which is the fraction 1/7.\n    *   Mass % of H = (mass of H) / (total mass) = 1/7.\n    *   This implies (mass of H) / (mass of C) = 1/6.\n    *   Let the formula be CxHy. Using atomic masses C≈12 and H≈1, we get (y * 1) / (x * 12) = 1/6.\n    *   This simplifies to 6y = 12x, or y = 2x.\n    *   The formula for Z is (CH2)n, or CnH2n. This is the general formula for a cycloalkane. Since Z is a saturated hydrocarbon, it must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclopentane (C5H10) and cyclohexane (C6H12). Both fit the CnH2n formula.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, C and D.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are either saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z (CnH2n).\n    *   Z is a constituent of mixture Y. Let's say C = Z = CnH2n (the cycloalkane).\n    *   The other component, D, must also hydrogenate to Z. Since D does not decolorize bromine water, it must be an aromatic compound with the same carbon skeleton. The most common and stable aromatic compounds are based on a benzene ring (n=6).\n    *   Let's hypothesize that n=6. Then Z is cyclohexane (C6H12). The corresponding aromatic compound D would be benzene (C6H6).\n    *   Let's check if this fits: Y = {cyclohexane (C6H12), benzene (C6H6)}.\n        *   Cyclohexane is saturated. Benzene only reacts with Br2 in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst, not with bromine water. So, Y does not decolorize bromine water. (This fits).\n        *   Hydrogenation of Y: Cyclohexane doesn't react. Benzene hydrogenates to cyclohexane (C6H6 + 3H2 -> C6H12). So, hydrogenation gives only one substance, Z=cyclohexane. (This fits).\n        *   The n=6 hypothesis seems very strong.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Reaction**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B.\n    *   X decolorizes bromine water, so A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n    *   Hydrogenation of X gives only Z (cyclohexane, C6H12). This means both A and B must have a six-carbon ring skeleton.\n    *   Molecules in X have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   The reaction is a disproportionation: X -> Y. Since X and Y are equimolar mixtures, the reaction is likely A + B -> C + D.\n    *   Substituting the identities of C and D (from our n=6 hypothesis): A + B -> C6H12 + C6H6.\n    *   This reaction represents a transfer of hydrogen atoms. By the law of conservation of mass, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants must equal the total in the products.\n    *   Total H atoms in products = (H in C6H12) + (H in C6H6) = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   Therefore, the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B must be 18. H(A) + H(B) = 18.\n\n4.  **Identify Substances A and B**\n    *   We need to find two compounds, A and B, that satisfy these conditions:\n        *   Have a 6-carbon ring skeleton.\n        *   Are unsaturated.\n        *   Are not conjugated.\n        *   H(A) + H(B) = 18.\n    *   The possible non-conjugated unsaturated C6-ring compounds are:\n        *   Cyclohexene: C6H10\n        *   1,4-Cyclohexadiene: C6H8\n        *   (1,3-Cyclohexadiene is conjugated, so it's ruled out).\n    *   Let's check the sum of hydrogens for this pair:\n        *   H(cyclohexene) + H(1,4-cyclohexadiene) = 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   This combination perfectly fits the hydrogen requirement. So, mixture X consists of cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene.\n    *   The disproportionation reaction is:\n        C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)\n        In this reaction, cyclohexene is reduced (gains 2H) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene is oxidized (loses 2H). This is a plausible catalytic hydrogen transfer.\n\n5.  **Answer the Question**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   The two liquids are cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms is the sum of hydrogens in one molecule of each component.\n    *   Total H = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   Let's test the general formulas for hydrocarbons.\n        *   Alkanes (CnH2n+2): Mass % H = (2n+2) / (12n + 2n+2) = (2n+2) / (14n+2). If n is large, this approaches 2/14 ≈ 14.3%. Let's check the given value: 14.28% is very close to 1/7.\n            (2n+2) / (14n+2) = 1/7 => 14n + 14 = 14n + 2 => 14 = 2, which is impossible.\n        *   Cycloalkanes (CnH2n): Mass % H = (2n) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 2/14 = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857. This is a perfect match for 14.28%.\n    *   So, Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states Z is widely used as a solvent and is formed from the hydrogenation of all other compounds in mixtures X and Y. This implies a stable, common structure. The most common cycloalkane solvents are cyclopentane (C5H10) and cyclohexane (C6H12). Both fit the CnH2n formula.\n    *   The problem also states Z does not react further with hydrogen, confirming it is a saturated compound (a cycloalkane).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction and Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture X (unsaturated) undergoes disproportionation on a heated platinum catalyst to form mixture Y (saturated/unreactive to Br2 water).\n    *   Disproportionation is a redox reaction where a substance is simultaneously oxidized and reduced. In this context, it will be a hydrogen transfer reaction. One molecule will gain hydrogen (reduction) and another will lose hydrogen (oxidation).\n    *   Mixture Y contains Z as one of its components. Let's assume Z is cyclohexane (C6H12), a very common solvent. This implies the carbon skeleton for all compounds is a six-membered ring.\n    *   So, one component of Y is cyclohexane (C6H12). Let's call it C. C = C6H12.\n    *   The other component of Y, let's call it D, must also be formed in the disproportionation. It does not decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenation of D must also yield Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   The most plausible \"oxidized\" product from a C6 ring that is stable and does not react with bromine water is benzene (C6H6). Aromatic compounds are unreactive towards Br2 water under standard test conditions. Severe hydrogenation of benzene does indeed produce cyclohexane.\n    *   So, we hypothesize that Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6).\n        *   C = Cyclohexane (C6H12)\n        *   D = Benzene (C6H6)\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Disproportionation Reaction**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B. The reaction is:\n        A + B --(Pt, heat)--> C + D\n    *   Substituting our identified components of Y:\n        A + B --(Pt, heat)--> Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)\n    *   This is an equimolar reaction producing an equimolar mixture, as stated.\n    *   Let's balance the atoms. All compounds have a C6 skeleton.\n        C6Hx + C6Hy -> C6H12 + C6H6\n    *   Balancing the hydrogen atoms: x + y = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   Now we need to identify A and B from the properties of mixture X.\n        *   They are unsaturated (decolorize Br2 water). This means x < 12 and y < 12.\n        *   They do not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n        *   They must hydrogenate to cyclohexane, so they must have a C6 ring skeleton.\n    *   Let's find C6-ring molecules that fit these descriptions and the hydrogen balance (x + y = 18).\n        *   A plausible candidate for A is **cyclohexene (C6H10)**. It has one double bond, is non-conjugated, and its formula is C6H10 (so x=10).\n        *   If x=10, then y must be 18 - 10 = 8. We need to find a non-conjugated C6-ring compound with the formula C6H8.\n        *   A plausible candidate for B is **cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)**. It has two double bonds separated by CH2 groups, so they are not conjugated. Its formula is C6H8 (so y=8). Cyclohexa-1,3-diene is ruled out because it is conjugated.\n    *   So, let's propose:\n        *   Mixture X = {Cyclohexene (C6H10), Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)}\n\n4.  **Final Verification**\n    *   **Mixture X**: An equimolar mixture of cyclohexene and cyclohexa-1,4-diene. Both are liquids, contain double bonds (decolorize Br2 water), and are non-conjugated. This fits.\n    *   **Reaction**: Cyclohexene (C6H10) + Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8) -> Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6). This is a valid hydrogen transfer (disproportionation). The diene (C6H8) is oxidized to benzene (C6H6), and the ene (C6H10) is reduced to the ane (C6H12).\n    *   **Mixture Y**: An equimolar mixture of cyclohexane and benzene. Both are liquids. Cyclohexane is saturated, and benzene is aromatic; neither decolorizes bromine water under normal conditions. This fits.\n    *   **Hydrogenation**:\n        *   Hydrogenation of X: Cyclohexene and cyclohexa-1,4-diene both hydrogenate to cyclohexane (Z).\n        *   Hydrogenation of Y: Cyclohexane is already Z. Benzene hydrogenates under severe conditions to cyclohexane (Z).\n    *   All conditions of the problem are met by this model.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n    *   Component A: Cyclohexene (C6H10) has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Component B: Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8) has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n    The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let's determine its molecular formula.\n    Mass fraction of H = (mass of H) / (total molecular mass)\n    0.1428 is very close to 1/7.\n    Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is approximately `y / (12x + y)`.\n    If the hydrocarbon is a saturated cycloalkane, its general formula is CnH2n.\n    The mass fraction of H would be `2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 2/14 = 1/7`.\n    This matches the given value perfectly (1/7 ≈ 0.142857).\n    If the hydrocarbon were a saturated alkane (CnH2n+2), the mass fraction of H would be `(2n+2) / (12n + 2n+2) = (2n+2) / (14n+2)`. Setting this to 1/7 gives `7(2n+2) = 14n+2`, which simplifies to `14n + 14 = 14n + 2`, or `14 = 2`, which is impossible.\n    Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n.\n\n2.  **Determine the Carbon Skeleton**\n    The problem states that hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y under severe conditions gives *only one* substance, Z. This is a critical clue. It means that all the chemical compounds present in mixtures X and Y have the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n    Z is also described as a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane, C6H12. This fits the formula CnH2n with n=6.\n    So, we can confidently identify Z as **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. Consequently, all compounds in mixtures X and Y are C6 compounds with a six-membered ring structure.\n\n3.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n    Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids formed from the disproportionation of X.\n    Y does *not* decolorize bromine water, which means its components are either saturated or aromatic.\n    We know that Z (cyclohexane, C6H12) is one of the components of Y. Cyclohexane is saturated.\n    Disproportionation reactions of unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbons, especially catalyzed by platinum, typically involve hydrogen transfer, producing a fully saturated molecule and a fully dehydrogenated (aromatic) molecule.\n    The fully dehydrogenated C6 ring is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene is aromatic and does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions.\n    Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n    Let's check this: Hydrogenation of mixture Y (cyclohexane + benzene) would yield:\n    *   Cyclohexane (C6H12) + H2 → No reaction (it's already saturated).\n    *   Benzene (C6H6) + 3H2 → Cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    The only product is cyclohexane (Z), which matches the problem statement.\n\n4.  **Identify the Components of Mixture X**\n    Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n    The reaction is a disproportionation that forms the equimolar mixture Y. Since both X and Y are equimolar mixtures, the reaction stoichiometry is likely 1:1.\n    A + B → Cyclohexane + Benzene\n    C6Hx + C6Hy → C6H12 + C6H6\n    To balance the hydrogen atoms, the total number of hydrogens in the reactants must equal the total in the products:\n    x + y = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    So, the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B must be 18.\n\n    Now we need to identify A and B based on the properties of mixture X:\n    *   They are C6 compounds with a six-membered ring skeleton.\n    *   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, so A and/or B must be unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds). They are cycloalkenes or cycloalkadienes.\n    *   There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules.\n\n    Let's list the possible candidates:\n    *   **Cyclohexene (C6H10)**: Has one double bond. It is not conjugated. This is a valid candidate. (x=10)\n    *   **Cyclohexadienes (C6H8)**: Have two double bonds.\n        *   1,3-Cyclohexadiene: The double bonds are conjugated. This is excluded by the problem statement.\n        *   **1,4-Cyclohexadiene**: The double bonds are separated by two single bonds (non-conjugated). This is a valid candidate. (y=8)\n\n    Since X is a mixture of \"two liquids,\" A and B must be different. The only valid candidates are cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene.\n    Let A = Cyclohexene (C6H10).\n    Let B = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n\n    Let's check the hydrogen sum: x + y = 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our requirement perfectly.\n    The reaction is a hydrogen transfer: the more unsaturated 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) is oxidized to benzene (C6H6) by losing 2H, and the less unsaturated cyclohexene (C6H10) is reduced to cyclohexane (C6H12) by gaining those 2H.\n    C6H8 + C6H10 --(Pt, heat)--> C6H6 + C6H12\n    This entire scheme is chemically consistent and fits all the clues provided in the problem.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer**\n    The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of the number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n    *   Liquid 1 (Cyclohexene, C6H10) has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Liquid 2 (1,4-Cyclohexadiene, C6H8) has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n\nThe problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let the molecular formula of Z be CxHy. The atomic mass of Carbon (C) is approximately 12 g/mol, and Hydrogen (H) is approximately 1 g/mol.\n\nThe mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as:\nMass Fraction of H = (Total mass of H) / (Total mass of hydrocarbon)\n0.1428 = (y * 1) / (x * 12 + y * 1)\n\nTo find the ratio of y to x:\n0.1428 * (12x + y) = y\n1.7136x + 0.1428y = y\n1.7136x = y - 0.1428y\n1.7136x = 0.8572y\ny / x = 1.7136 / 0.8572 ≈ 2\n\nThis means the empirical formula for Z is CH2. The general formula for a hydrocarbon with this empirical formula is (CH2)n or CnH2n.\n\nThe problem also states that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (it does not react further with hydrogen) and is widely used as a solvent. A hydrocarbon with the general formula CnH2n that is saturated must be a cycloalkane. A very common cycloalkane used as a solvent is cyclohexane, which has the formula C6H12.\n\nLet's verify the mass fraction of hydrogen for cyclohexane (C6H12) using integer masses:\nMass fraction of H = (12 * 1) / (6 * 12 + 12 * 1) = 12 / (72 + 12) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857.\nThis matches the given value of 14.28%. Therefore, substance Z is cyclohexane (C6H12).\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n\nMixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One of its constituents is Z, which we have identified as cyclohexane (C6H12). Let the other component be W.\nSo, Y = {cyclohexane (C6H12), W}.\n\nWe know that mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water. Cyclohexane is a saturated alkane and does not react with bromine water. Therefore, W must also be a substance that does not decolorize bromine water. This means W is likely a saturated or aromatic compound.\n\nFurthermore, the hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n*   Hydrogenation of cyclohexane (C6H12) yields cyclohexane (no reaction as it's already saturated).\n*   Hydrogenation of W must yield cyclohexane (C6H12).\n\nIf W were a saturated hydrocarbon, to be converted to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation, it would need to be an isomer of cyclohexane (like methylcyclopentane). However, the problem says mixture Y is formed from disproportionation, which typically involves changes in the degree of unsaturation. A more fitting candidate for W is an aromatic compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane. The only C6 aromatic hydrocarbon is benzene (C6H6).\n\nLet's check if benzene fits the description:\n*   Hydrogenation of benzene under severe conditions (as stated in the problem) gives cyclohexane: C6H6 + 3H2 --(Pt)--> C6H12. This fits.\n*   Benzene does not decolorize bromine water under standard conditions (it undergoes substitution, not addition, and the reaction is not with bromine water). This fits.\n\nTherefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Mixture X**\n\nMixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B. When heated with platinum, X undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form Y.\nA disproportionation reaction in this context is a hydrogen transfer reaction, where some molecules are hydrogenated (gain H) and others are dehydrogenated (lose H).\n\nThe overall reaction is:\nMixture X (A + B) → Mixture Y (C6H12 + C6H6)\n\nSince the mixtures are equimolar, the reaction at the molecular level is:\nA + B → C6H12 + C6H6\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, the number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the equation.\n*   The hydrogenation of both A and B gives only cyclohexane (C6H12). This implies that both A and B must have a C6 carbon skeleton. Let their formulas be C6Ha and C6Hb.\n*   The reaction becomes: C6Ha + C6Hb → C6H12 + C6H6.\n\nNow, let's balance the hydrogen atoms:\nTotal H atoms in reactants = Total H atoms in products\na + b = 12 + 6\na + b = 18\n\nThe problem asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This corresponds to the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of liquid A and one molecule of liquid B, which is `a + b`.\n\nBased on our stoichiometric analysis, this sum is 18.\n\nThe other pieces of information (X decolorizes bromine water, no conjugated bonds) help confirm the identities of A and B (likely cyclohexene, C6H10, and 1,4-cyclohexadiene, C6H8, where 10 + 8 = 18), but they are not required to find the total number of hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each of the two liquids in mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the hydrocarbon Z.**\n\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n*   Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CxHy.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by: `(y * AtomicMass_H) / (x * AtomicMass_C + y * AtomicMass_H) = 0.1428`.\n*   Using approximate atomic masses (C=12, H=1), the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`.\n*   Let's calculate the ratio of C to H atoms. Mass fraction of Carbon = 100% - 14.28% = 85.72%.\n*   Ratio of moles `C:H = (85.72 / 12) : (14.28 / 1) = 7.14 : 14.28`.\n*   Dividing by the smaller number (7.14), we get the ratio `1 : 2`.\n*   The empirical formula of Z is CH2. The molecular formula is (CH2)n, or CnH2n.\n*   Let's verify the mass fraction for CnH2n: `MassFraction(H) = (2n * 1) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857...`, which matches the given 14.28%.\n*   The problem states that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (it does not react further with hydrogen). A saturated hydrocarbon with the general formula CnH2n must be a **cycloalkane**.\n*   Z is also described as being \"widely used as a solvent\". The most common cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. Let's assume Z is cyclohexane. This assumption will be verified against the other conditions.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the components of mixture Y.**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids formed from X.\n*   Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane, C6H12).\n*   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of mixture Y.\n*   Let the two components of Y be Y1 and Y2. We know Y1 is Z, so Y1 is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n*   The other component, Y2, must also produce only cyclohexane upon hydrogenation under severe conditions. It also must not decolorize bromine water. A very common C6 hydrocarbon that fits this description is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene is aromatic and does not react with bromine water, and its hydrogenation yields cyclohexane.\n*   So, let's propose that Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**. This fits all the properties described for Y.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the components of mixture X and the reaction.**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2.\n*   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, meaning at least one component (and likely both) is an unsaturated hydrocarbon (contains C=C or C≡C bonds).\n*   The molecules in X have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This implies that both X1 and X2 have a six-carbon ring skeleton.\n*   Mixture Y = {cyclohexane, benzene} is formed from mixture X = {X1, X2} via disproportionation. This suggests a hydrogen transfer reaction where one component of X is hydrogenated and the other is dehydrogenated.\n*   Since the product mixture Y is equimolar, the reaction stoichiometry must be 1:1:1:1.\n    `X1 + X2 --(Pt, heat)--> Y1 + Y2`\n    `X1 + X2 --> C6H12 + C6H6`\n*   By conservation of atoms, the total number of carbon and hydrogen atoms must be the same on both sides. Both X1 and X2 have a C6 skeleton.\n    `C6Ha + C6Hb --> C6H12 + C6H6`\n    This means the total number of hydrogen atoms must balance: `a + b = 12 + 6 = 18`.\n*   We need to find two unsaturated, non-conjugated C6-ring compounds, C6Ha and C6Hb, such that their hydrogen counts sum to 18.\n    *   **Cyclohexene (C6H10)** is a C6-ring with one double bond. It is not conjugated. `a=10`.\n    *   **Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)** is a C6-ring with two double bonds. The double bonds are at positions 1 and 4, so they are isolated, not conjugated. `b=8`.\n*   Let's check if this pair works: `a + b = 10 + 8 = 18`. This is a perfect match.\n*   So, mixture X is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)**.\n*   The overall reaction is a hydrogen transfer:\n    `Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8) + Cyclohexene (C6H10) --> Benzene (C6H6) + Cyclohexane (C6H12)`\n    Here, cyclohexene is reduced (hydrogenated) to cyclohexane, and cyclohexa-1,4-diene is oxidized (dehydrogenated) to benzene. All conditions are satisfied.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final answer.**\n\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   The two liquids are cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8).\n*   Total hydrogen atoms = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexene) + (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexa-1,4-diene)\n*   Total hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms is 18. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z:**\n    *   The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CₓHᵧ. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by `(y * 1.008) / (x * 12.011 + y * 1.008)`. For simplicity, we can use integer masses: `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   Let's test the general formula for cycloalkanes, CₙH₂ₙ. The mass fraction of hydrogen would be `2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7`.\n    *   Calculating `1/7` as a percentage gives `(1/7) * 100% ≈ 14.2857%`. This is a perfect match for the given value.\n    *   Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   The problem also states that Z is a liquid widely used as a solvent and does not react further with hydrogen (it's saturated). The most common cycloalkane fitting this description is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n2.  **Determine the Components of Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   We are told that Z (cyclohexane) is one of the components of mixture Y.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives *only* Z (cyclohexane). This means both components of Y must have a six-carbon skeleton.\n    *   Let the components of Y be Y₁ and Y₂. We know Y₁ is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The other component, Y₂, must also produce cyclohexane upon hydrogenation. Since Y₂ does not decolorize bromine water, it cannot be an alkene. The only common C₆ compound that is not an alkene but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic and does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions, but it is hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions (high temperature/pressure).\n    *   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction from Mixture X to Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture X (an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X₁ and X₂) is converted into mixture Y (cyclohexane and benzene) through a disproportionation reaction. A disproportionation reaction is one where a substance is simultaneously oxidized and reduced. In this context, it refers to a hydrogen transfer reaction.\n    *   The reaction is: `X₁ + X₂ --(Pt, heat)--> C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆`\n    *   We are also told that hydrogenating mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This implies that both X₁ and X₂ are C₆ hydrocarbons with a ring structure, which become C₆H₁₂ upon adding hydrogen.\n    *   The reaction involves molecules that all have 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, we can find the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (mixture X) by applying the law of conservation of mass to the hydrogen atoms.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms in Mixture X:**\n    *   According to the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n    *   Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n    *   Total H atoms in products = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X (one molecule of each) must also be 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n(For a complete picture, a plausible identity for mixture X would be cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈). They both decolorize bromine water, have no conjugated bonds, and their total hydrogen count is 10 + 8 = 18. The disproportionation reaction `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` is chemically sound.)\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z.**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CxHy. The mass percentage of hydrogen is given by `(y * AtomicMass_H) / (x * AtomicMass_C + y * AtomicMass_H) * 100`.\n    *   Using integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1) for simplicity, the fraction of hydrogen mass is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   14.28% is very close to 100/7. So, `y / (12x + y) ≈ 1/7`.\n    *   This gives `7y ≈ 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y ≈ 12x`, or `y ≈ 2x`.\n    *   A hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n can be either an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z is formed after hydrogenation under severe conditions and does not react further with hydrogen. This indicates that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon.\n    *   Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n.\n    *   Let's verify the mass percentage for CnH2n using integer masses:\n        `Mass % H = (2n * 1) / (n * 12 + 2n * 1) * 100 = 2n / 14n * 100 = (1/7) * 100 = 14.2857...%`. This is a perfect match.\n    *   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane (C6H12). Let's assume Z is cyclohexane for now and check if it fits all other conditions.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y and the Hydrogenation Process.**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only one substance, Z.\n    *   Z (cyclohexane, C6H12) is a constituent of mixture Y.\n    *   Let mixture Y = {Y1, Y2}. We can set Y1 = Z = Cyclohexane.\n    *   Hydrogenating Y, which is {Cyclohexane, Y2}, gives only Cyclohexane.\n        *   Hydrogenating Cyclohexane gives Cyclohexane (no reaction).\n        *   Therefore, hydrogenating Y2 must also yield Cyclohexane.\n    *   Since Y does not decolorize bromine water, Y2 must be a saturated compound or an aromatic compound that can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane. The most logical candidate for Y2 is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene does not react with bromine water without a catalyst, and its hydrogenation yields cyclohexane: C6H6 + 3H2 → C6H12.\n    *   So, Mixture Y = {Cyclohexane (C6H12), Benzene (C6H6)}. This is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that fit the description.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Disproportionation Reaction.**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2.\n    *   X decolorizes bromine water, so X1 and X2 are unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds).\n    *   There are no conjugated multiple bonds in X's components.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means both X1 and X2 have a six-membered ring carbon skeleton.\n    *   The reaction from X to Y is a disproportionation on a platinum catalyst:\n        X1 + X2 → Y1 + Y2 (equimolar)\n        Substituting our findings:\n        X1 + X2 → Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)\n    *   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One molecule is hydrogenated (gaining hydrogen) and the other is dehydrogenated (losing hydrogen). To balance the hydrogen atoms:\n        H_atoms(X1) + H_atoms(X2) = H_atoms(C6H12) + H_atoms(C6H6)\n        H_atoms(X1) + H_atoms(X2) = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   Since X1 and X2 are unsaturated compounds with a cyclohexane skeleton, they must be cyclohexene or cyclohexadienes.\n        *   Cyclohexane: C6H12\n        *   Cyclohexene: C6H10\n        *   Cyclohexadienes: C6H8\n    *   We need two different compounds from this list whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18. The only possible combination is **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and a **cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n        10 + 8 = 18. This is a perfect match.\n    *   The problem specifies \"no conjugated multiple bonds\". Cyclohexene has only one double bond. For the cyclohexadiene (C6H8), there are two isomers: cyclohexa-1,3-diene (conjugated) and **cyclohexa-1,4-diene** (non-conjugated). Therefore, the diene must be cyclohexa-1,4-diene.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion and Answer.**\n    *   The two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8).\n    *   The reaction is:\n        C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (cyclohexa-1,4-diene) --[Pt, heat]--> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in cyclohexene) + (H atoms in cyclohexa-1,4-diene)\n    *   Total H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z:**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon, so its formula is C_n H_m.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%, which is equivalent to 14.28 / 100 ≈ 1/7.\n    *   The formula for the mass fraction of hydrogen is: `(m * Ar(H)) / (n * Ar(C) + m * Ar(H))`, where Ar(H) ≈ 1 and Ar(C) ≈ 12.\n    *   So, `m / (12n + m) ≈ 1/7`.\n    *   This gives `7m ≈ 12n + m`, which simplifies to `6m ≈ 12n`, or `m ≈ 2n`.\n    *   The empirical formula of Z is CH₂.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a saturated hydrocarbon.\n    *   A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula C_n H_{2n} must be a monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane). Alkanes have the formula C_n H_{2n+2}.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One of them is Z (the cycloalkane, C_n H_{2n}). Let's call the other liquid D.\n    *   Mixture Y = {Z, D}.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water. Since Z is a saturated cycloalkane, it does not react. This means D also must not decolorize bromine water.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only substance Z.\n        *   Hydrogenating Z (a saturated cycloalkane) will just yield Z itself.\n        *   Hydrogenating D must therefore also yield Z.\n    *   For D to be hydrogenated to Z, it must have the same carbon skeleton as Z but be unsaturated. Since D does not decolorize bromine water, it cannot be a typical alkene or alkyne. This strongly indicates that D is an aromatic compound (an arene). Aromatic compounds only react with hydrogen under severe conditions (high pressure/temperature) and do not react with bromine water.\n    *   So, Z is a cycloalkane C_n H_{2n}, and D is the corresponding aromatic compound (arene) with the formula C_n H_{2n-6} (for a single benzene ring structure).\n    *   This structure requires n ≥ 6, as the smallest aromatic ring is benzene (C₆).\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Reaction:**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n    *   X decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only substance Z. This means both A and B, when hydrogenated, form Z. Thus, A and B must also have the same C_n carbon skeleton as Z and D. They must be cycloalkenes or cyclodienes.\n    *   The reaction is: Mixture X --(Pt, heat)--> Mixture Y. This is described as a disproportionation. In this context, it's a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component is reduced (gains hydrogen) and the other is oxidized (loses hydrogen).\n    *   The reaction is: A + B → Z + D.\n    *   Since A and B are cycloalkenes/dienes that form the cycloalkane Z, and D is an aromatic compound, the most logical composition for A and B is one cycloalkene and one cyclodiene.\n        *   Let A be the cycloalkene: C_n H_{2n-2}.\n        *   Let B be the cyclodiene: C_n H_{2n-4}.\n    *   The reaction becomes: C_n H_{2n-2} (A) + C_n H_{2n-4} (B) → C_n H_{2n} (Z) + C_n H_{2n-6} (D).\n        *   Let's check the hydrogen balance: Left side = (2n-2) + (2n-4) = 4n-6. Right side = (2n) + (2n-6) = 4n-6. The reaction is balanced.\n        *   The cycloalkene (A) is hydrogenated to the cycloalkane (Z), and the cyclodiene (B) is dehydrogenated to the aromatic compound (D). This is a plausible disproportionation (hydrogen transfer) that produces an equimolar mixture Y from an equimolar mixture X.\n    *   The problem also states that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X. This means the cyclodiene (B) must have isolated double bonds (e.g., a 1,4-diene, not a 1,3-diene).\n\n4.  **Determine the value of 'n' and the Final Answer:**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is the sum of hydrogens in A and B.\n    *   Total H atoms = (2n-2) + (2n-4) = 4n-6.\n    *   We need to find 'n'. The problem is constructed such that the answer should be one of the options. Let's test the options that correspond to integer values of n.\n        *   A) 18: If 4n-6 = 18, then 4n = 24, which gives n=6. This is a valid solution.\n        *   B) 12: If 4n-6 = 12, then 4n = 18, which gives n=4.5 (not an integer).\n        *   C) 22: If 4n-6 = 22, then 4n = 28, which gives n=7. This is also a valid solution.\n        *   D) 16: If 4n-6 = 16, then 4n = 22, which gives n=5.5 (not an integer).\n    *   We have two plausible scenarios:\n        *   **Scenario n=6:** Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), D is benzene (C₆H₆). A is cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀), and B is 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈). Total H atoms in X = 10 + 8 = 18.\n        *   **Scenario n=7:** Z is methylcyclohexane (C₇H₁₄), D is toluene (C₇H₈). A is methylcyclohexene (C₇H₁₂), and B is a non-conjugated methylcyclohexadiene (C₇H₁₀). Total H atoms in X = 12 + 10 = 22.\n    *   Both scenarios are chemically sound and fit all the conditions. However, in the absence of further information, chemistry problems of this type usually refer to the most fundamental parent compounds. The cyclohexane/benzene system (n=6) is the quintessential example of this type of chemistry, often used as the primary illustration in textbooks. Therefore, it is the most probable intended answer.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Assuming n=6, the two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. Let's determine the empirical formula of Z.\n    *   The mass fraction of Carbon is 100% - 14.28% = 85.72%.\n    *   Let's find the ratio of moles of H to C. Assuming 100g of substance, we have 14.28 g of H and 85.72 g of C.\n    *   Moles of H = 14.28 g / 1.008 g/mol ≈ 14.17 mol.\n    *   Moles of C = 85.72 g / 12.011 g/mol ≈ 7.14 mol.\n    *   The ratio of H atoms to C atoms is approximately 14.17 / 7.14 ≈ 2.\n    *   Alternatively, using the approximation C=12 and H=1, a mass fraction of H of 14.28% is very close to 1/7. For a hydrocarbon CnHx, the mass fraction of H is `x / (12n + x)`. Setting this to 1/7 gives `7x = 12n + x`, which simplifies to `6x = 12n`, or `x = 2n`.\n    *   So, the general formula for Z is CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (it does not react further with hydrogen). An acyclic saturated hydrocarbon is an alkane (CnH2n+2), and a cyclic saturated hydrocarbon is a cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n    *   Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvents are cyclohexane (C6H12) and methylcyclohexane (C7H14), both of which fit the formula CnH2n.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y contains two liquids, let's call them C and D, in an equimolar ratio.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water. This implies that C and D are saturated compounds. However, aromatic compounds like benzene and toluene also do not decolorize bromine water under standard test conditions, so they are a possibility.\n    *   Z is a constituent of Y. Let's say C = Z. So, C is a cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y under severe conditions gives only Z.\n        *   Hydrogenation of C (which is Z) naturally gives Z.\n        *   Hydrogenation of D must also give Z. If D were a saturated isomer of Z (like methylcyclopentane is to cyclohexane), this would be possible via isomerization under severe conditions. However, a more elegant solution exists if we consider aromatic compounds. Aromatic compounds are \"unsaturated\" in structure but \"saturated\" in the bromine water test. They readily hydrogenate to the corresponding cycloalkane.\n    *   Let's hypothesize that D is the aromatic derivative corresponding to the cycloalkane Z.\n        *   If Z is cyclohexane (C6H12), then D would be benzene (C6H6).\n        *   If Z is methylcyclohexane (C7H14), then D would be toluene (C7H8).\n    *   This hypothesis is strong because hydrogenation of benzene gives cyclohexane, and hydrogenation of toluene gives methylcyclohexane. Thus, hydrogenation of Y = {cyclohexane, benzene} gives only cyclohexane, and hydrogenation of Y = {methylcyclohexane, toluene} gives only methylcyclohexane. This fits all the conditions for Y.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Reaction**\n    *   Mixture X contains two liquids, A and B, in an equimolar ratio.\n    *   X decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and/or B contain C=C or C≡C bonds.\n    *   There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of X.\n    *   Hydrogenation of X gives only Z. This is a crucial clue: it means that both A and B must have the same carbon skeleton, and this skeleton is that of Z.\n    *   The reaction X → Y is a disproportionation that produces an equimolar mixture. This suggests a 1:1 reaction: A + B → C + D.\n\n4.  **Construct the Reaction**\n    *   Let's combine our findings. We have a reaction where A and B react to form C and D in a 1:1 ratio.\n        `A + B → C + D`\n    *   Let's test the C6 case: Z = cyclohexane (C6H12).\n        *   Y = {cyclohexane (C), benzene (D)}. So C = C6H12 and D = C6H6.\n        *   The reaction is `A + B → C6H12 + C6H6`. To balance atoms, A and B must be C6 compounds, and the total atom count must match. The products have C12 and H18. So A+B must be C12H18.\n        *   Since A and B must hydrogenate to cyclohexane, they must be C6 compounds with a six-membered ring. Let's find two such compounds whose formulas sum to C12H18. The most plausible candidates are cyclohexene (C6H10) and a cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n        *   `C6H10 + C6H8` gives C12H18. This matches.\n        *   The specific diene must be non-conjugated. Cyclohexa-1,4-diene is non-conjugated. Cyclohexa-1,3-diene is conjugated. So, B must be cyclohexa-1,4-diene.\n        *   Let's propose the final set of compounds:\n            *   X = {cyclohexene (A, C6H10), cyclohexa-1,4-diene (B, C6H8)}\n            *   Y = {cyclohexane (C, C6H12), benzene (D, C6H6)}\n            *   Z = cyclohexane (C6H12)\n        *   This system fits all the conditions of the problem perfectly. The reaction `C6H10 + C6H8 → C6H12 + C6H6` is a known type of hydrogen transfer reaction, driven by the formation of the stable aromatic ring, and it qualifies as a disproportionation.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   Liquid A is cyclohexene, C6H10, which has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Liquid B is cyclohexa-1,4-diene, C6H8, which has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n*(Self-correction: A similar consistent scenario can be constructed for the C7 case (Z=methylcyclohexane), leading to a total H count of 22. However, the cyclohexane/benzene system is the most fundamental and classic example of this type of transformation, making it the most likely intended answer in a chemistry problem of this nature.)*\n\nThe two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8).\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n    *   Let the formula of Z be CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by (y * mass_H) / (x * mass_C + y * mass_H).\n    *   Using approximate atomic masses (C=12, H=1), the fraction is y / (12x + y).\n    *   Setting this equal to 14.28% or 0.1428:\n        y / (12x + y) ≈ 1/7\n        7y = 12x + y\n        6y = 12x\n        y = 2x\n    *   This means the empirical formula of Z is CH2. The general molecular formula is CnH2n. This formula corresponds to either an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen. Alkenes react with hydrogen (hydrogenation), but saturated cycloalkanes do not (under most conditions). Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   We are also told that Z is widely used as a solvent and is a liquid. The most common cycloalkane that fits this description is cyclohexane (C6H12). Let's check the mass percent for C6H12 with more precise atomic masses (C≈12.01, H≈1.01):\n        Mass of H = 12 * 1.01 = 12.12\n        Mass of C = 6 * 12.01 = 72.06\n        Total Mass = 84.18\n        %H = (12.12 / 84.18) * 100% ≈ 14.4%, which is close to 14.28%. The y=2x relationship is very strong.\n    *   The entire reaction scheme involves conversions that give a single product Z upon hydrogenation. This strongly implies all key compounds (A, B, C, D) share the same carbon skeleton, which is the C6 skeleton of cyclohexane.\n    *   Therefore, **Z is cyclohexane, C6H12**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, C and D.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water, which means C and D are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   Z (cyclohexane) is itself a constituent of mixture Y. Let's say **C = Z = cyclohexane (C6H12)**. Cyclohexane is saturated and does not decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenating it gives itself.\n    *   Now for substance D: It must be hydrogenated to cyclohexane (C6H12), meaning it has a C6 skeleton. It must not decolorize bromine water. The most common compound fitting this description is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene does not react with bromine water (without a catalyst) and is hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n    *   So, **mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Transformation from X to Y**\n    *   Mixture X (an equimolar mixture of liquids A and B) is converted to mixture Y (cyclohexane and benzene) upon heating with platinum.\n    *   The reaction is described as a disproportionation. In this context, it implies a hydrogen transfer reaction where one species is hydrogenated (reduced) and another is dehydrogenated (oxidized).\n    *   The overall reaction can be written as a 1:1 reaction between the components of the equimolar mixture X to form the components of the equimolar mixture Y:\n        A + B → C + D\n        A + B → C6H12 + C6H6\n    *   All compounds (A, B, C, D) have a C6 skeleton. Let the formula for A be C6Ha and for B be C6Hb.\n    *   By the principle of conservation of atoms, the number of hydrogen atoms must be equal on both sides of the equation:\n        Number of H in (A + B) = Number of H in (C6H12 + C6H6)\n        a + b = 12 + 6\n        a + b = 18\n\n4.  **Determine the Final Answer**\n    *   The question asks for the \"total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X\". This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of liquid A and one molecule of liquid B.\n    *   From our analysis, this sum is a + b, which we calculated to be 18.\n\n5.  **Consistency Check**\n    *   Does mixture X decolorize bromine water? This means A or B (or both) must be unsaturated (contain C=C bonds).\n    *   Are there no conjugated multiple bonds in X?\n    *   Let's find plausible structures for A and B. We need two C6 cyclic hydrocarbons (that hydrogenate to cyclohexane) with a total of 18 hydrogens. A good candidate pair would be cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n        *   a = 10, b = 8. So a + b = 18. This fits.\n        *   Both cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene decolorize bromine water.\n        *   Cyclohexene has one double bond (not conjugated). 1,4-cyclohexadiene has two isolated double bonds (not conjugated). This fits the condition. 1,3-cyclohexadiene would be ruled out because it is conjugated.\n        *   The reaction would be a hydrogen transfer: C6H10 (acceptor) + C6H8 (donor) → C6H12 + C6H6. This is a known type of reaction.\n    *   The existence of this plausible pair confirms our reasoning is sound. The core calculation (a+b=18) is independent of finding the exact structures but is reinforced by it.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nThis is a chemistry problem that can be solved by systematically analyzing the properties of the mixtures and substances involved.\n\n**1. Identify Substance Z**\n\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon and is saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\").\n*   Its mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28% (or 0.1428).\n*   Let's determine the general formula of Z.\n    *   For an alkane (CnH2n+2), the mass fraction of H using integer masses (C=12, H=1) is (2n+2)/(14n+2). Setting this to 0.1428 does not yield a positive integer 'n'.\n    *   For a cycloalkane (CnH2n), the mass fraction of H is (2n)/(14n) = 2/14 = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857. This is a very close match to the given 14.28%.\n*   Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane with the general formula CnH2n.\n*   The fact that hydrogenation of mixtures X and Y gives *only* Z means all components in these mixtures have the same carbon skeleton, which is a C_n ring.\n*   Z is a widely used solvent. Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclohexane (C6H12) and methylcyclohexane (C7H14).\n\n**2. Analyze Mixture Y**\n\n*   Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that do not decolorize bromine water.\n*   One component of Y is Z (the CnH2n cycloalkane). Let's call this Y1.\n*   The other component, Y2, must also have the C_n skeleton (since its hydrogenation gives Z) and must not decolorize bromine water. The most plausible candidate for Y2 is an aromatic hydrocarbon, which is relatively unreactive with bromine water.\n*   The aromatic analog of a CnH2n cycloalkane belongs to the benzene series, with the general formula CnH2n-6.\n*   So, Mixture Y consists of **Y1 = CnH2n (a cycloalkane)** and **Y2 = CnH2n-6 (an aromatic hydrocarbon)**. For this to work, Y1 and Y2 must have the same number of carbon atoms, 'n'.\n\n**3. Analyze Mixture X and the Disproportionation Reaction**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2. They both decolorize bromine water, meaning they are unsaturated.\n*   X has \"no conjugated multiple bonds\".\n*   The reaction is an equimolar mixture X being converted to an equimolar mixture Y upon heating with a Platinum catalyst. This is a disproportionation reaction, which in this context means a hydrogen transfer reaction.\n    *   `X1 + X2 -> Y1 + Y2`\n*   Since Y1 (CnH2n) is more hydrogenated and Y2 (CnH2n-6) is less hydrogenated than the starting materials X1 and X2, one component of X must have lost hydrogen (was oxidized) and the other must have gained hydrogen (was reduced).\n*   Let's check the conservation of atoms for a 1:1 reaction. The total number of hydrogens must be conserved. Let X1 be CnH_x and X2 be CnH_y.\n    *   `x + y = (2n) + (2n - 6) = 4n - 6`\n*   X1 and X2 are unsaturated versions of the cycloalkane Z. A cycloalkene would have formula CnH(2n-2), and a non-conjugated cyclodiene would be CnH(2n-4).\n*   Let's test these as components of X:\n    *   X1 = CnH(2n-2) (cycloalkene)\n    *   X2 = CnH(2n-4) (cyclodiene)\n*   Let's check our hydrogen conservation rule:\n    *   `x + y = (2n - 2) + (2n - 4) = 4n - 6`. This matches perfectly.\n*   Therefore, mixture X is composed of a cycloalkene and a non-conjugated cyclodiene with the same carbon skeleton.\n\n**4. Determine the value of 'n' (the number of Carbon atoms)**\n\nThe problem can be solved for any 'n' that results in one of the given answers. Let's test the most common simple cases.\n\n*   **Case n=6:**\n    *   Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12), a very common solvent.\n    *   Y = {Cyclohexane (C6H12), Benzene (C6H6)}.\n    *   X = {Cyclohexene (C6H10), 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)}. The 1,4-diene is chosen because it is not conjugated.\n    *   The reaction is `C6H10 + C6H8 -> C6H12 + C6H6`. This is a balanced hydrogen transfer.\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   Total H = (H in C6H10) + (H in C6H8) = 10 + 8 = **18**.\n\n*   **Case n=7:**\n    *   Z = Methylcyclohexane (C7H14), also a solvent.\n    *   Y = {Methylcyclohexane (C7H14), Toluene (C7H8)}.\n    *   X = {Methylcyclohexene (C7H12), a non-conjugated Methylcyclohexadiene (C7H10)}.\n    *   The reaction is `C7H12 + C7H10 -> C7H14 + C7H8`. This is also a balanced hydrogen transfer.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms in mixture X.\n    *   Total H = (H in C7H12) + (H in C7H10) = 12 + 10 = **22**.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nBoth n=6 and n=7 lead to plausible scenarios and correspond to options D (18) and A (22). However, problems of this nature in chemistry competitions or textbooks typically refer to the simplest, most fundamental parent system unless specified otherwise. The C6 system (cyclohexane/benzene) is the archetypal example for this type of transformation (hydrogenation, disproportionation, aromaticity). Therefore, the C6 system is the most probable intended answer.\n\nThe liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze and identify hydrocarbon Z.**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon. Let its general formula be CxHy.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is given as 14.28%. Let's convert this percentage to a fraction: 14.28% ≈ 14.28 / 100 ≈ 1/7.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen can be expressed using the atomic masses of Carbon (≈12 amu) and Hydrogen (≈1 amu): Mass fraction (H) = `(y * 1) / (x * 12 + y * 1)`.\n    *   Setting this equal to 1/7: `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`.\n    *   Cross-multiplying gives: `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n    *   This means the empirical formula of Z is (CH2)n, and its molecular formula is CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a saturated hydrocarbon. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Z is also described as being widely used as a solvent. The most common and simple cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane, C6H12. This fits the CnH2n formula with n=6. Let's assume Z is cyclohexane.\n\n2.  **Analyze and identify mixture Y.**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. Let's call them Y1 and Y2.\n    *   Y is formed by the disproportionation of mixture X on a heated platinum catalyst.\n    *   Z (cyclohexane, C6H12) is a constituent of mixture Y. So, let's say Y1 = cyclohexane.\n    *   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water, which means its components are saturated or aromatic. Cyclohexane is saturated.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n        *   Hydrogenating Y1 (cyclohexane) will yield cyclohexane.\n        *   Hydrogenating Y2 must also yield cyclohexane (C6H12). This means Y2 must have a C6 carbon skeleton.\n    *   The reaction of an unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbon on a platinum catalyst to yield a mixture of an aromatic compound and a saturated cycloalkane is a well-known disproportionation reaction (specifically, a Zelinaky irreversible catalysis). For a C6 system, this reaction produces benzene and cyclohexane.\n    *   This suggests that Y2 is benzene (C6H6). Let's check if this fits the facts:\n        *   Benzene is a liquid.\n        *   Benzene does not decolorize bromine water.\n        *   Hydrogenation of benzene under severe conditions (high pressure/temperature with a catalyst like Pt) yields cyclohexane: C6H6 + 3H2 → C6H12.\n    *   Therefore, the conclusion that mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of benzene (C6H6) and cyclohexane (C6H12) is very well-supported.\n\n3.  **Determine the composition of mixture X.**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2.\n    *   It undergoes disproportionation to form mixture Y:\n        X1 + X2 → Y1 + Y2\n        X1 + X2 → C6H6 + C6H12\n    *   A chemical reaction, including disproportionation, must conserve the number of atoms of each element. By balancing the hydrogen atoms:\n        Total H atoms in (X1 + X2) = Total H atoms in (C6H6 + C6H12)\n        Total H atoms = 6 + 12 = 18.\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This corresponds to the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of X1 and one molecule of X2. This value is 18.\n\n4.  **Final verification.**\n    *   Let's ensure there exist compounds X1 and X2 that fit the remaining criteria.\n    *   Both X1 and X2 must have a C6 skeleton, as they both hydrogenate to cyclohexane.\n    *   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, so at least one (and likely both) of X1 and X2 must be an unsaturated alkene or alkyne.\n    *   The molecules in X have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   We need two C6 cyclic hydrocarbons, X1=C6Ha and X2=C6Hb, such that a + b = 18. They must be unsaturated.\n    *   Consider cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n        *   Total H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18. This matches.\n        *   Both are unsaturated and will decolorize bromine water.\n        *   Cyclohexene has one double bond (not conjugated).\n        *   1,4-cyclohexadiene has two double bonds separated by two single bonds, so they are not conjugated.\n        *   The disproportionation reaction would be a hydrogen transfer: the diene (C6H8) loses 2 H to become benzene (C6H6), and the monoene (C6H10) gains these 2 H to become cyclohexane (C6H12). This is a chemically plausible reaction:\n            C6H8 + C6H10 --(Pt, heat)--> C6H6 + C6H12\n    *   All conditions are met by this model, which confirms our calculation based on atom conservation.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each of the two liquids in mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the empirical and molecular formula of hydrocarbon Z.**\n\nZ is a hydrocarbon with the general formula CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given as 14.28%.\nMass fraction of Hydrogen = (y × Ar(H)) / (x × Ar(C) + y × Ar(H)) = 0.1428\nLet's use the approximate atomic masses: Ar(H) ≈ 1 and Ar(C) ≈ 12.\nThe mass fraction of hydrogen can be expressed as y / (12x + y).\nSo, y / (12x + y) ≈ 0.1428\nThe value 0.1428 is very close to 1/7 (1/7 ≈ 0.142857).\nLet's assume the mass fraction is exactly 1/7.\ny / (12x + y) = 1/7\n7y = 12x + y\n6y = 12x\ny = 2x\nThis means the empirical formula of Z is CH2, and the general formula is CnH2n.\n\nThe problem states that Z is formed by hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a saturated hydrocarbon. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Z and the components of mixture Y.**\n\n*   Hydrogenation of both mixtures X and Y gives only one substance, Z. This implies that all components in X and Y are based on the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n*   Z is a common solvent and a cycloalkane. The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane (C6H12). Let's test this hypothesis.\n*   For cyclohexane (C6H12), the mass fraction of hydrogen is (12 × 1.008) / (6 × 12.011 + 12 × 1.008) ≈ 14.37%, which is very close to the given 14.28%. Let's assume Z is cyclohexane.\n*   Mixture Y is formed from X, and its components do not decolorize bromine water. This means they are saturated or aromatic (aromatic rings do not react with bromine water under standard conditions).\n*   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of mixture Y. Let Y = {Z, D}.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z. This means hydrogenation of Z gives Z (it's already saturated) and hydrogenation of D gives Z.\n*   Since D is in mixture Y, it does not decolorize bromine water (it's saturated or aromatic). For D to be hydrogenated to Z (cyclohexane), it must have the same C6 carbon skeleton. A saturated C6 isomer would be something like methylcyclopentane, which has a different skeleton. However, an aromatic compound with a C6 skeleton is benzene (C6H6). Benzene can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   So, a very strong candidate for mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\nLet's check if this fits the conditions for Y:\n1.  Equimolar mixture of two liquids: Yes.\n2.  Does not decolorize bromine water: Yes, both cyclohexane (saturated) and benzene (aromatic) do not react with Br2 water.\n3.  Hydrogenation gives one substance Z: Hydrogenation of {cyclohexane, benzene} gives only cyclohexane. This fits perfectly.\n4.  Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of Y: Yes.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the components of mixture X and the reaction.**\n\nThe reaction is the conversion of mixture X into mixture Y.\nX = {A, B} → Y = {cyclohexane, benzene}\nThe reaction is an equimolar disproportionation. A disproportionation reaction in this context is a hydrogen transfer, where one molecule is reduced (gains hydrogen) and another is oxidized (loses hydrogen).\nSince we start with an equimolar mixture X = {A, B} and end with an equimolar mixture Y = {cyclohexane, benzene}, the reaction must be:\nA + B → cyclohexane (C6H12) + benzene (C6H6)\n(in a 1:1 molar ratio)\n\nFor this to be a hydrogen transfer, one reactant must be reduced to cyclohexane, and the other must be oxidized to benzene.\n*   Reduction: C6Hx + 2H → C6H12 (cyclohexane). This implies the reactant has the formula C6H10. This is **cyclohexene**.\n*   Oxidation: C6Hy - 2H → C6H6 (benzene). This implies the reactant has the formula C6H8. This could be a **cyclohexadiene**.\n\nSo, mixture X is likely composed of cyclohexene (C6H10) and a cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\nThe overall reaction is:\nC6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (cyclohexadiene) → C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)\nIn this reaction, cyclohexadiene acts as the hydrogen donor (gets oxidized to benzene), and cyclohexene acts as the hydrogen acceptor (gets reduced to cyclohexane). The hydrogen atoms are conserved (10 + 8 = 12 + 6).\n\nNow let's check if this choice for X fits all the given conditions:\n1.  Equimolar mixture of two liquids: Yes, cyclohexene and cyclohexadienes are liquids.\n2.  Decolorizes bromine water: Yes, both contain C=C double bonds.\n3.  Hydrogenation gives only Z (cyclohexane):\n    *   C6H10 + H2 → C6H12\n    *   C6H8 + 2H2 → C6H12\n    This is true.\n4.  No conjugated multiple bonds: Cyclohexene has one double bond, so no conjugation. For cyclohexadiene (C6H8), there are two isomers: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated). The problem specifies no conjugated bonds, so the component must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene**.\n\nThe model is fully consistent. Mixture X is {cyclohexene, 1,4-cyclohexadiene}.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final answer.**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   Liquid 1: Cyclohexene (C6H10) has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n*   Liquid 2: 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis number can also be found directly from the H-balance in Step 3, where the total H atoms in the reactants must equal the total H atoms in the products (12 + 6 = 18).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z.**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   14.28% is very close to 1/7 (which is approximately 14.2857%).\n    *   Let's check the general formulas for hydrocarbons to see which one gives a hydrogen mass fraction of 1/7. We can use integer atomic masses for this (C=12, H=1).\n        *   Alkanes (CnH2n+2): Mass % H = (2n+2) / (12n + 2n+2) = (2n+2) / (14n+2). This is not equal to 1/7.\n        *   Alkenes/Cycloalkanes (CnH2n): Mass % H = (2n) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 2/14 = 1/7. This matches.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a saturated compound. This rules out it being an alkene. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n.\n    *   The problem also states that Z is widely used as a solvent. Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclopentane (C5H10) and cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    *   Let's check the mass fraction for C6H12: Mass % H = (12 * 1) / (6 * 12 + 12 * 1) = 12 / (72 + 12) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%. This is a perfect match.\n    *   Therefore, **Z is cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n2.  **Identify the components of Mixture Y.**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, C and D.\n    *   Mixture Y is formed from the disproportionation of X.\n    *   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Substance Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of mixture Y. Let's say **D = Z = cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y (C + D) gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means hydrogenation of C must also yield cyclohexane.\n    *   Since Y does not decolorize bromine water, C cannot be an alkene or alkyne. It could be a saturated compound or an aromatic one.\n        *   If C is a saturated isomer of cyclohexane (like methylcyclopentane), its hydrogenation under severe conditions would break the ring and form acyclic alkanes (like hexane), not cyclohexane.\n        *   This leaves the possibility that C is an aromatic compound. Benzene (C6H6) does not decolorize bromine water (without a catalyst) and its hydrogenation gives cyclohexane (C6H6 + 3H2 → C6H12).\n    *   This fits all the criteria. Therefore, **mixture Y consists of benzene (C6H6) and cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n3.  **Identify the components of Mixture X and the reaction.**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B.\n    *   X undergoes disproportionation on a platinum catalyst to form the equimolar mixture Y.\n        *   Reaction: A + B → C + D\n        *   Substituting the known components of Y: **A + B → Benzene (C6H6) + Cyclohexane (C6H12)**\n    *   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. All molecules involved must have the same carbon skeleton, because hydrogenation of both A and B results in cyclohexane. This means A and B are C6 hydrocarbons.\n    *   Let A = C6Hx and B = C6Hy. By balancing the hydrogen atoms in the reaction:\n        *   x + y = 6 (from benzene) + 12 (from cyclohexane)\n        *   **x + y = 18**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which is precisely the sum x + y.\n\n4.  **Verify the properties of Mixture X.**\n    *   We have determined that the total number of hydrogen atoms in molecules A and B is 18. Let's find what A and B are to ensure consistency with the remaining conditions.\n    *   Condition: Mixture X decolorizes bromine water. This means A and/or B must contain C=C double bonds (i.e., they are unsaturated). Their formulas must be C6Hx where x < 12.\n    *   Condition: There are no conjugated multiple bonds in A or B.\n    *   Let's find a pair of C6-ring based unsaturated hydrocarbons (that hydrogenate to cyclohexane) such that the sum of their hydrogens is 18. The candidates are:\n        *   Cyclohexene (C6H10)\n        *   Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8) (non-conjugated)\n        *   (Cyclohexa-1,3-diene is C6H8 but is conjugated, so it is ruled out).\n    *   Let's test the pair {Cyclohexene, Cyclohexa-1,4-diene}:\n        *   Let A = Cyclohexene (C6H10) and B = Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8).\n        *   Number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our calculation.\n        *   The disproportionation reaction would be:\n            C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (cyclohexa-1,4-diene) → C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)\n            This is a chemically plausible hydrogen transfer. The diene loses 2H to become benzene, and the mono-ene gains 2H to become cyclohexane.\n        *   All other conditions are satisfied by this choice of A and B.\n\n5.  **Final Answer.**\n    *   The two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8).\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each of these liquids is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Hydrocarbon Z.**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon that does not react further with hydrogen, which means it is a saturated hydrocarbon (an alkane or a cycloalkane).\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%.\n    *   Let the formula of Z be CxHy. The mass percentage of hydrogen is given by `(y * AtomicMass(H)) / (x * AtomicMass(C) + y * AtomicMass(H)) * 100%`.\n    *   Using approximate atomic masses (H=1, C=12), the formula becomes `y / (12x + y) = 0.1428`.\n    *   This value is very close to 1/7 (`1/7 ≈ 0.142857`). Let's assume the mass percentage is 1/7.\n        *   `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`\n        *   `7y = 12x + y`\n        *   `6y = 12x`\n        *   `y = 2x`\n    *   A hydrocarbon with the formula `CnH2n` is either an alkene or a cycloalkane. Since Z is saturated, it must be a **cycloalkane**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y and the Disproportionation Reaction.**\n    *   Mixture Y is formed by the disproportionation of mixture X on a platinum catalyst. This type of reaction often involves hydrogenation and dehydrogenation.\n    *   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated (like Z) or aromatic.\n    *   The complete hydrogenation of Y gives only Z. This means any non-saturated component in Y must hydrogenate to Z. The most common stable product of dehydrogenation on Pt is an aromatic ring.\n    *   Z is a constituent of mixture Y.\n    *   Putting this together: Y is an equimolar mixture of the cycloalkane Z and a corresponding aromatic compound which, upon hydrogenation, also yields Z.\n    *   The simplest and most classic example of this system involves a six-membered ring. Let's assume Z is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**, which is a common solvent.\n    *   The corresponding aromatic compound would be **benzene (C6H6)**. Upon hydrogenation (`C6H6 + 3H2 -> C6H12`), benzene gives cyclohexane.\n    *   So, we can hypothesize:\n        *   **Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12)**\n        *   **Mixture Y = Equimolar mixture of Cyclohexane (C6H12) and Benzene (C6H6)**.\n    *   This hypothesis fits all the conditions for Y and Z.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X.**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n    *   The reaction is `A + B --(Pt, heat)--> Cyclohexane + Benzene`.\n    *   Since this is a 1:1 reaction producing a 1:1 mixture, we can deduce the elemental composition by balancing the atoms.\n        *   Reactants: A (CxHy) + B (CzHw)\n        *   Products: C6H12 + C6H6 = C12H18\n        *   Therefore, `A + B` must contain 12 carbon atoms and 18 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   The fact that hydrogenation of mixture X also yields only Z (cyclohexane) implies that both A and B must have the same carbon skeleton as cyclohexane, i._e._, a six-membered ring.\n    *   So, both A and B are C6 compounds. Their formulas must be `C6Ha` and `C6Hb`.\n        *   `a + b = 18`\n    *   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, so A and/or B must be unsaturated (contain C=C bonds).\n    *   The problem states there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the compounds of mixture X.\n\n4.  **Identify the components of Mixture X.**\n    *   We need to find two non-conjugated, unsaturated C6 ring compounds, C6Ha and C6Hb, such that `a + b = 18`.\n    *   Let's list the possibilities for unsaturated C6 ring compounds:\n        *   **Cyclohexene (C6H10)**: One double bond. Not conjugated. This is a candidate for A or B.\n        *   **Cyclohexa-1,3-diene (C6H8)**: Two double bonds. They are conjugated. This is ruled out by the problem statement.\n        *   **Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)**: Two double bonds. They are separated by two single bonds, so they are not conjugated. This is a candidate.\n    *   Let's try to form a pair (A, B) from these candidates.\n        *   If we take A = Cyclohexene (C6H10), we need B to be a C6H(18-10) = C6H8 compound. The only non-conjugated option is Cyclohexa-1,4-diene.\n    *   So, Mixture X consists of:\n        *   **A = Cyclohexene (C6H10)**\n        *   **B = Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)**\n    *   This pair fits all conditions: equimolar, both decolorize bromine water, no conjugated bonds, and their combined atom count matches the products. The reaction is a hydrogen transfer: the diene (C6H8) is oxidized to benzene (C6H6) by losing 2H, and the monoene (C6H10) is reduced to cyclohexane (C6H12) by gaining 2H.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer.**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n    *   Number of H atoms in Cyclohexene (C6H10) = 10\n    *   Number of H atoms in Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8) = 8\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis result corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z.**\n    The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CxHy.\n    The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by: (mass of H) / (total mass) = (y * AtomicMass_H) / (x * AtomicMass_C + y * AtomicMass_H).\n    Using approximate atomic masses (H=1, C=12), the equation is: y / (12x + y) = 0.1428.\n    This simplifies to y ≈ 2x.\n    The empirical formula is CH2. The general formula for a hydrocarbon with this ratio is CnH2n. This corresponds to either an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n    The problem states that Z is formed by hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z must be a saturated compound, which rules out alkenes. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n    Z is also described as a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent fitting this description is cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    Let's verify the mass fraction for cyclohexane (C6H12):\n    Mass of H = 12 * 1.008 = 12.096\n    Mass of C = 6 * 12.011 = 72.066\n    Total Mass = 12.096 + 72.066 = 84.162\n    Mass fraction of H = 12.096 / 84.162 ≈ 0.1437, which is very close to 14.28%. Using simpler masses (12 and 1), the fraction is exactly 12/84 = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857.\n    So, Z is confirmed to be **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n2.  **Determine the Carbon Skeleton of all Components.**\n    The problem states that hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y gives *only* hydrocarbon Z (cyclohexane). This implies that all components in both mixtures X and Y are compounds with a six-carbon skeleton, which can be converted to a cyclohexane ring upon hydrogenation.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture Y.**\n    Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One of its constituents is Z, which is cyclohexane (C6H12). Let's call the components Y1 and Y2. So, Y1 = cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    Mixture Y \"does not decolorize bromine water\". This typically means the components are saturated (no C=C or C≡C bonds) or aromatic.\n    Hydrogenation of Y gives only cyclohexane. We know Y1 (cyclohexane) is already saturated. For Y2, hydrogenation must also yield cyclohexane.\n    If Y2 were saturated (like Y1), the reaction producing Y would not be a disproportionation (which involves oxidation and reduction). A mixture of two saturated C6H12 isomers is not formed by disproportionation.\n    This suggests that the phrase \"does not decolorize bromine water\" should also include aromatic compounds, as they are unreactive with bromine water without a Lewis acid catalyst.\n    Let's hypothesize that Y2 is an aromatic compound with a C6 skeleton, which is **benzene (C6H6)**.\n    So, **Y = an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6)**.\n    Let's check if this hypothesis for Y fits all conditions:\n    *   It's an equimolar mixture of two liquids. (Yes)\n    *   It does not decolorize bromine water. (Yes, neither cyclohexane nor benzene do under normal conditions).\n    *   Hydrogenation gives only Z (cyclohexane). (Yes: C6H12 stays C6H12; C6H6 + 3H2 -> C6H12).\n    *   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent. (Yes).\n    This hypothesis works perfectly.\n\n4.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Disproportionation Reaction.**\n    Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2.\n    It undergoes a disproportionation reaction when heated with platinum to form Y. Disproportionation in this context is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component is oxidized (loses hydrogen), and another is reduced (gains hydrogen).\n    The reaction is: X1 + X2 → Y1 + Y2.\n    Since X and Y are both equimolar mixtures, the stoichiometry is likely 1:1:1:1.\n    X1 + X2 → C6H6 + C6H12\n    By the principle of conservation of atoms, the total number of carbon and hydrogen atoms on both sides of the equation must be equal. The carbon atoms are already balanced (6+6 on the left, 6+6 on the right). Let's balance the hydrogen atoms.\n    (H atoms in X1) + (H atoms in X2) = (H atoms in benzene) + (H atoms in cyclohexane)\n    (H atoms in X1) + (H atoms in X2) = 6 + 12 = 18.\n\n5.  **Identify the Components of Mixture X.**\n    We need to find two compounds, X1 and X2, that fit the following criteria:\n    *   They are liquids with a C6 skeleton.\n    *   They decolorize bromine water (i.e., they are unsaturated).\n    *   They do not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   Their molecules' hydrogen atoms sum to 18.\n    *   Hydrogenation of both yields cyclohexane (so they must have a C6 ring structure).\n\n    Let's consider possible unsaturated C6 ring compounds:\n    *   Cyclohexene: C6H10. It has one double bond and is not conjugated. Hydrogenation gives cyclohexane.\n    *   Cyclohexadienes: C6H8. There are two isomers:\n        *   1,3-cyclohexadiene: Has conjugated double bonds, so it's ruled out.\n        *   1,4-cyclohexadiene: Has isolated (non-conjugated) double bonds. Hydrogenation gives cyclohexane.\n\n    Now let's see which pair sums to 18 hydrogen atoms:\n    *   If X1 = cyclohexene (C6H10) and X2 = cyclohexene (C6H10), the sum is 10 + 10 = 20. (Incorrect)\n    *   If X1 = 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) and X2 = 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8), the sum is 8 + 8 = 16. (Incorrect)\n    *   If X1 = cyclohexene (C6H10) and X2 = 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8), the sum is 10 + 8 = 18. (**Correct**)\n\n    So, mixture X is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**. The reaction is:\n    C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) + C6H10 (cyclohexene) --(Pt/heat)--> C6H6 (benzene) + C6H12 (cyclohexane)\n    In this reaction, 1,4-cyclohexadiene is oxidized to benzene, and cyclohexene is reduced to cyclohexane. This is a classic example of catalytic hydrogen transfer.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Answer.**\n    The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of the hydrogen atoms in one molecule of the first liquid and one molecule of the second liquid.\n    Total H atoms = (H atoms in cyclohexene) + (H atoms in 1,4-cyclohexadiene)\n    Total H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon, with a general formula CxHy.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%, which is 0.1428.\n*   Mass fraction of H = (mass of H) / (total mass) = (y * 1) / (x * 12 + y * 1) (using approximate atomic masses H=1, C=12).\n*   0.1428 = y / (12x + y)\n*   0.1428 * (12x + y) = y\n*   1.7136x + 0.1428y = y\n*   1.7136x = 0.8572y\n*   y/x = 1.7136 / 0.8572 ≈ 2.\n*   The empirical formula of Z is CH2. The general formula is (CH2)n or CnH2n.\n*   This general formula CnH2n corresponds to either alkenes or cycloalkanes.\n*   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, which means it is a saturated compound. An alkene is unsaturated, so Z must be a saturated cycloalkane.\n\n*   We are also told that Z is widely used as a solvent. Common cycloalkane solvents are cyclopentane (C5H10) and cyclohexane (C6H12). We will proceed with the assumption that it's one of these, likely cyclohexane due to its commonality in the reactions described.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids formed from mixture X.\n*   Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated (like Z) or aromatic.\n*   One component of Y is the hydrocarbon Z (a cycloalkane).\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z. This means both components of Y, when hydrogenated, yield Z.\n*   Let's assume Z is cyclohexane (C6H12). One component of Y is cyclohexane. The other component of Y must also be a C6 liquid that hydrogenates to cyclohexane and does not decolorize bromine water. The only C6 compound that fits this description is benzene (C6H6). Benzene is aromatic and only reacts with bromine in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst, not with bromine water alone. Under severe conditions (high pressure/temperature with a catalyst), benzene can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane.\n*   So, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Components of Mixture X**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them X1 and X2.\n*   X decolorizes bromine water, so X1 and X2 are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n*   The reaction X -> Y is a disproportionation, which in this context means a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component is oxidized (loses hydrogen) and the other is reduced (gains hydrogen).\n    *   X1 + X2 --(Pt, heat)--> cyclohexane + benzene\n*   From this reaction, the stoichiometry must be 1:1 -> 1:1 because both X and Y are equimolar mixtures.\n*   Let's check the atom balance. The products are C6H12 and C6H6.\n    *   Total C atoms = 6 + 6 = 12.\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   Therefore, the reactants (one molecule of X1 and one molecule of X2) must also have a total of 12 carbon atoms and 18 hydrogen atoms.\n*   Since hydrogenating both X1 and X2 gives Z (cyclohexane, C6H12), both X1 and X2 must be C6 cyclic hydrocarbons with the same carbon skeleton as cyclohexane.\n*   So, X1 is C6Ha and X2 is C6Hb, where a + b = 18.\n*   The reaction is: C6Ha + C6Hb -> C6H12 + C6H6.\n*   This is a hydrogen transfer. One compound loses hydrogen to become benzene, and the other gains hydrogen to become cyclohexane.\n    *   One reactant must have more hydrogen than benzene (Ha > 6) and will be oxidized: C6Ha -> C6H6.\n    *   The other reactant must have less hydrogen than cyclohexane (Hb < 12) and will be reduced: C6Hb -> C6H12.\n*   The components of X are unsaturated C6 cyclic molecules, but they do not have conjugated multiple bonds. Let's list the possibilities:\n    *   **Cyclohexene (C6H10)**: One double bond, not conjugated. This is a possible component.\n    *   **Cyclohexadienes (C6H8)**:\n        *   1,3-cyclohexadiene: Has conjugated double bonds. This is ruled out by the problem statement.\n        *   **1,4-cyclohexadiene**: Has two isolated (non-conjugated) double bonds. This is a possible component.\n*   We need to find a pair from our possible components (cyclohexene C6H10 and 1,4-cyclohexadiene C6H8) such that their hydrogen atoms sum to 18.\n    *   Let X1 = cyclohexene (C6H10) and X2 = 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   Total H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our requirement.\n*   Let's check the reaction with this pair:\n    *   1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) loses 2H to become benzene (C6H6). This is oxidation.\n    *   Cyclohexene (C6H10) gains 2H to become cyclohexane (C6H12). This is reduction.\n    *   The overall reaction is C6H8 + C6H10 -> C6H6 + C6H12. This is a balanced hydrogen transfer (disproportionation).\n*   Thus, mixture X consists of cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms**\n\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n*   Liquid 1 (X1): Cyclohexene (C6H10) has **10** hydrogen atoms.\n*   Liquid 2 (X2): 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) has **8** hydrogen atoms.\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n    The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let's determine its empirical and molecular formula.\n    The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by:\n    Mass Fraction (H) = (Total mass of H) / (Total molecular mass)\n    14.28% is very close to 1/7 or ~0.142857.\n    Let's test the general formulas for hydrocarbons:\n    *   For an alkane (CnH2n+2), the mass fraction of H is (2n + 2) / (12n + 2n + 2) = (2n + 2) / (14n + 2). Setting this to 1/7 gives 14n + 14 = 14n + 2, which is impossible.\n    *   For an alkene or cycloalkane (CnH2n), the mass fraction of H is 2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 2/14 = 1/7. This matches the given value perfectly.\n    *   So, Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n.\n    The problem also states that Z is widely used as a solvent and does not react further with hydrogen, implying it is a stable, saturated compound. Cyclohexane (C6H12) is a very common solvent and is a stable cycloalkane. This fits the description.\n    Therefore, **Z is cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n2.  **Characterize Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them C and D.\n    *   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of mixture Y. So, let **C = cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n    *   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means both C and D must be saturated or aromatic compounds (which do not react with aqueous bromine under normal conditions). Cyclohexane is saturated.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means hydrogenation of C gives cyclohexane (which is trivial) and hydrogenation of D must also give cyclohexane.\n    *   We need to find a liquid D that does not decolorize bromine water and can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane. The most logical candidate, especially in the context of a disproportionation reaction involving a C6 ring, is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene is a liquid, does not decolorize bromine water, and its complete hydrogenation product is cyclohexane.\n    *   Therefore, **Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction: Mixture X → Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B.\n    *   The reaction is described as a disproportionation. In this context, it refers to a catalytic hydrogen transfer reaction where one component is reduced (gains hydrogen) and the other is oxidized (loses hydrogen).\n    *   The reaction is: `Mixture X (A + B) --(Pt, heat)--> Mixture Y (C + D)`\n    *   Substituting the components of Y, we get: `A + B → Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)`\n    *   Since X and Y are both equimolar mixtures, the reaction stoichiometry must be 1:1, meaning one molecule of A reacts with one molecule of B to produce one molecule of cyclohexane and one molecule of benzene.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms in Mixture X**\n    *   According to the principle of conservation of atoms, the total number of each type of atom must be the same on both sides of the reaction.\n    *   The problem implies that all compounds (A, B, C, D, and Z) share the same carbon skeleton, as they all yield Z upon hydrogenation. Since Z is cyclohexane (a C6 ring), A and B must also be C6 compounds.\n    *   Let's balance the hydrogen atoms for the reaction `A + B → C6H12 + C6H6`:\n    *   (Number of H atoms in A) + (Number of H atoms in B) = (Number of H atoms in C6H12) + (Number of H atoms in C6H6)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n    The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X (i.e., in one molecule of compound A and one molecule of compound B) is 18.\n\n6.  **Verification (Optional but Recommended)**\n    Can we find plausible compounds A and B?\n    *   We need H(A) + H(B) = 18.\n    *   A and B must be C6 unsaturated compounds that decolorize bromine water.\n    *   A and B must not have conjugated double bonds.\n    *   In the reaction A + B → C6H12 + C6H6, one compound gets reduced and one gets oxidized. This is a transfer of hydrogen atoms. Let's say B is reduced and A is oxidized.\n    *   B + nH → C6H12 (Reduction)\n    *   A - nH → C6H6 (Oxidation)\n    *   A logical candidate for B is **cyclohexene (C6H10)**. It gets reduced to cyclohexane by gaining 2 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   A logical candidate for A is a **cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**. It gets oxidized to benzene by losing 2 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Let's check the number of hydrogen atoms: 10 (from cyclohexene) + 8 (from cyclohexadiene) = 18. This matches our calculation.\n    *   The condition that there are no conjugated bonds means that the cyclohexadiene must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene**, not the conjugated 1,3-isomer.\n    *   So, a possible composition for Mixture X is an equimolar mix of 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) and cyclohexene (C6H10). This fits all the conditions described in the problem.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which we have determined to be 18.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere's a detailed step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Hydrocarbon Z**:\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let's determine its empirical formula.\n    *   Mass fraction of H = 14.28% = 0.1428. Mass fraction of C = 100% - 14.28% = 85.72%.\n    *   The ratio of moles C : H is (85.72 / 12.01) : (14.28 / 1.008) ≈ 7.14 : 14.17.\n    *   Dividing by the smallest number (7.14), we get a ratio of approximately 1 : 2.\n    *   Therefore, the empirical formula of Z is CH2, and its general molecular formula is (CH2)n or CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states that hydrogenation of mixtures X and Y gives *only* Z, and Z does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a saturated hydrocarbon.\n    *   A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem also mentions that Z is a constituent of mixture Y and is widely used as a solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvents are cyclopentane (C5H10) and cyclohexane (C6H12). Both fit the CnH2n formula.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y and the Disproportionation Reaction**:\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids formed from mixture X upon treatment with heated platinum. This reaction is described as a disproportionation. In heterogeneous catalysis involving hydrocarbons, \"disproportionation\" often refers to a hydrogen transfer reaction where some molecules are dehydrogenated (lose hydrogen) and others are hydrogenated (gain hydrogen).\n    *   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water, which means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Mixture Y consists of Z (our cycloalkane) and another liquid, let's call it W. So, Y = {W, Z}.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z. This means `Hydrogenation(W) -> Z` and `Hydrogenation(Z) -> Z`. Since Z is already saturated, the second part is expected. For `Hydrogenation(W) -> Z` to occur, and given that W does not decolorize bromine water, W is most likely an aromatic compound that can be hydrogenated to the cycloalkane Z.\n    *   This strongly suggests that Z is **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and W is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene is aromatic, does not decolorize bromine water, and its hydrogenation under severe conditions yields cyclohexane. Both are liquids and widely used. This seems like a very strong hypothesis.\n    *   Let's check if all components have the same carbon skeleton. Hydrogenation of X, Y, W, and Z all lead to Z (cyclohexane). This confirms all compounds in this problem are based on a C6 skeleton.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Reaction**:\n    *   We have an equimolar mixture X of two liquids, A and B. So X = {A, B}.\n    *   The reaction is: A + B --(Pt, heat)--> W + Z (in equimolar amounts).\n    *   Substituting our identified compounds: A(C6Hx) + B(C6Hy) -> Benzene(C6H6) + Cyclohexane(C6H12).\n    *   This is a hydrogen disproportionation. One molecule is fully dehydrogenated to benzene, and the other is fully hydrogenated to cyclohexane. To balance the number of hydrogen atoms, the total number of hydrogens in the reactants must equal the total in the products.\n    *   Total H atoms in reactants = x + y.\n    *   Total H atoms in products = 6 (from benzene) + 12 (from cyclohexane) = 18.\n    *   Therefore, **x + y = 18**.\n\n4.  **Identify Components of Mixture X (A and B)**:\n    *   We know A and B are two different C6 liquids.\n    *   They both decolorize bromine water, which means they are unsaturated (contain double bonds).\n    *   Their carbon skeleton is the same as cyclohexane. This implies they are cyclic C6 compounds.\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B is 18.\n    *   The problem states there are no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   Let's find plausible structures. We need two different unsaturated cyclic C6 hydrocarbons that sum to 18 hydrogens.\n    *   A cycloalkane has formula CnH2n. A cycloalkene (one double bond) is CnH2n-2. A cycloalkadiene (two double bonds) is CnH2n-4.\n    *   For n=6:\n        *   Cyclohexane (saturated): C6H12\n        *   Cyclohexene (one double bond): C6H10\n        *   Cyclohexadiene (two double bonds): C6H8\n    *   We need two different molecules from this list (or isomers) whose hydrogens sum to 18. The combination `10 + 8 = 18` works perfectly.\n    *   So, one component (A) is **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and the other (B) is a **cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n    *   The condition \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" points to **1,4-cyclohexadiene** for the C6H8 molecule, as 1,3-cyclohexadiene has conjugated double bonds.\n    *   Let's check the final setup:\n        *   Mixture X = {cyclohexene, 1,4-cyclohexadiene}. Both are liquids, decolorize bromine water, and will hydrogenate to cyclohexane.\n        *   Reaction: `Cyclohexene (C6H10) + 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)` --(Pt, heat)--> `Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)`. This is a classic, balanced disproportionation reaction.\n        *   Mixture Y = {cyclohexane, benzene}. Neither decolorizes bromine water.\n        *   Z = cyclohexane. It is part of Y. It's a solvent. Mass % H ≈ 14.3%. All conditions are perfectly met.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer**:\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   This is the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of substance A and one molecule of substance B.\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in C6H10) + (H atoms in C6H8) = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere is my thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z:**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%. Let's determine its empirical and molecular formula.\n    *   Mass % of Hydrogen = 14.28% ≈ 1/7.\n    *   Mass % of Carbon = 100% - 14.28% = 85.72% ≈ 6/7.\n    *   Ratio of atoms C:H = (%C / M_C) : (%H / M_H) = (85.72 / 12) : (14.28 / 1) ≈ 7.14 : 14.28 ≈ 1 : 2.\n    *   The empirical formula of Z is CH2.\n    *   The general formula for a hydrocarbon with this empirical formula is (CH2)n, or CnH2n. This corresponds to either an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, which means it is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   We are also told that Z is widely used as a solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvents are cyclopentane (C5H10) and cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    *   Both X and Y hydrogenate to a *single* substance Z. This implies that all components of mixtures X and Y must share the same carbon skeleton.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y and its formation:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them C and D.\n    *   Y is formed by heating mixture X with Platinum (Pt). This is a catalytic process, often associated with hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, or, as stated, disproportionation.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components (C and D) are either saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Substance Z is a constituent of mixture Y. Let's assume C is Z. So, C is a saturated cycloalkane.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y (C+D) gives only Z. This means hydrogenation of C gives Z (which is trivial, as C=Z and Z is saturated) and hydrogenation of D must also give Z.\n    *   Since D hydrogenates to Z (a cycloalkane), D must be an unsaturated or aromatic compound with the same carbon skeleton as Z. Since D does not decolorize bromine water, it must be aromatic.\n    *   So, we have a pair: a saturated cycloalkane (C=Z) and an aromatic hydrocarbon (D) with the same carbon skeleton. The most common and simple example of such a pair is cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6).\n    *   Let's check if Z = C6H12 (cyclohexane) fits the data. Hydrogenation of benzene (C6H6) gives cyclohexane (C6H12). Cyclohexane is a widely used solvent. The mass percentage of H in C6H12 is (12*1.008) / (6*12.011 + 12*1.008) ≈ 14.37%, which is very close to 14.28% (the problem likely uses integer masses where 12/(6*12+12) = 12/84 = 1/7 ≈ 0.1428). This confirms Z is likely cyclohexane.\n    *   So, Mixture Y = {Cyclohexane (C6H12), Benzene (C6H6)}.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Disproportionation Reaction:**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B.\n    *   X decolorizes bromine water, so A and/or B are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n    *   The reaction is: A + B --(Pt, heat)--> Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6). This is a disproportionation, which in this context means a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component is reduced (gains H), and the other is oxidized (loses H).\n    *   Since A and B both hydrogenate to Z (cyclohexane), they must both be unsaturated C6 cyclic hydrocarbons.\n    *   The overall reaction for the components must be: C6Hx + C6Hy → C6H12 + C6H6.\n    *   By conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms must be the same on both sides.\n    *   Total H atoms = H(A) + H(B) = H(cyclohexane) + H(benzene) = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   So we are looking for two unsaturated C6 cyclic molecules whose hydrogen counts (x and y) add up to 18.\n    *   Since A and B are unsaturated, x < 12 and y < 12.\n    *   A plausible combination is a C6H10 molecule (a cyclohexene) and a C6H8 molecule (a cyclohexadiene). 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   Let A = Cyclohexene (C6H10) and B = Cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   The reaction would be: C6H10 + C6H8 → C6H12 + C6H6.\n    *   In this reaction, cyclohexene (A) is reduced to cyclohexane by gaining 2 hydrogen atoms. Cyclohexadiene (B) is oxidized to benzene by losing 2 hydrogen atoms. The hydrogen transfer is balanced.\n    *   The problem also states there are no *conjugated* multiple bonds in mixture X. Cyclohexa-1,3-diene is conjugated. Therefore, the C6H8 molecule must be the non-conjugated isomer, cyclohexa-1,4-diene. Cyclohexene is not conjugated.\n    *   This set of molecules fits all conditions of the problem.\n    *   Mixture X = {Cyclohexene (C6H10), Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)}.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X\". This means the sum of the number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component of the mixture.\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in C6H10) + (H atoms in C6H8)\n    *   Total H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the molecular formula of hydrocarbon Z.**\nZ is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let the formula be C_n H_m.\nThe mass fraction of hydrogen is given by:\nMass % H = (m × M_H) / (n × M_C + m × M_H)\nWhere M_H ≈ 1 g/mol and M_C ≈ 12 g/mol.\n0.1428 = (m × 1) / (n × 12 + m × 1)\nLet's test the fraction 1/7, which is approximately 0.142857.\nm / (12n + m) = 1 / 7\n7m = 12n + m\n6m = 12n\nm = 2n\nSo, the general formula for Z is C_n H_{2n}.\n\nThe problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a saturated hydrocarbon. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula C_n H_{2n} must be a cycloalkane.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Z and the components of mixture Y.**\n*   Z is a cycloalkane and is widely used as a solvent. Common examples are cyclopentane (C5H10), cyclohexane (C6H12), and methylcyclohexane (C7H14).\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One of these liquids is Z. Let's call the other liquid D.\n*   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated or aromatic. Since Z is a saturated cycloalkane, D must also be saturated or aromatic.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only Z. This means that D, upon hydrogenation, also yields Z.\n*   This implies that D must have the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n*   The reaction X -> Y is a disproportionation, which in this context involves dehydrogenation and hydrogenation. This suggests D is a dehydrogenated form of a related cycloalkane, which points towards an aromatic compound.\n\nLet's test possible identities for Z:\n*   **Case n=5:** If Z is cyclopentane (C5H10), D would have to be an aromatic C5 compound that hydrogenates to cyclopentane. There are no stable neutral aromatic C5 hydrocarbons (the cyclopentadienyl anion is aromatic, but that's not what we have here). So, n=5 is unlikely.\n*   **Case n=6:** If Z is cyclohexane (C6H12), then D must be an aromatic compound with a C6 skeleton that hydrogenates to cyclohexane. The only candidate is **benzene (C6H6)**.\n    *   So, Mixture Y = {cyclohexane (C6H12), benzene (C6H6)}.\n    *   This is a mixture of two liquids. Benzene does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions. Hydrogenation of benzene gives cyclohexane. This case is perfectly consistent.\n*   **Case n=7:** If Z is methylcyclohexane (C7H14), then D must be an aromatic compound with a C7 skeleton that hydrogenates to methylcyclohexane. The candidate is **toluene (methylbenzene, C7H8)**.\n    *   So, Mixture Y = {methylcyclohexane (C7H14), toluene (C7H8)}.\n    *   This case is also perfectly consistent.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the reaction X -> Y and identify the components of mixture X.**\nThe reaction transforms an equimolar mixture X = {A, B} into an equimolar mixture Y = {Z, D}. This happens in a 1:1 molar ratio, so the overall reaction is:\nA + B → Z + D\nThis is a hydrogen transfer reaction, a type of disproportionation where one molecule is hydrogenated and the other is dehydrogenated.\nLet's balance the hydrogen atoms for the two plausible cases:\n*   **Case n=6:** A + B → C6H12 + C6H6. The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B must be 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   **Case n=7:** A + B → C7H14 + C7H8. The total number of hydrogen atoms must be 14 + 8 = 22.\n\nNow let's find A and B for each case.\n*   A and B are liquids in an equimolar mixture X.\n*   They both decolorize bromine water, so they are unsaturated (contain C=C bonds).\n*   They have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   Hydrogenation of both A and B gives only Z, so they must have the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n\nLet's analyze the candidates for X:\n*   **Case n=6 (Z = cyclohexane):**\n    *   A and B must be unsaturated C6-ring compounds (not conjugated).\n    *   Possible molecules are cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   Let's check the total hydrogen atoms: 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our requirement.\n    *   Cyclohexene has one double bond (not conjugated). 1,4-cyclohexadiene has two isolated double bonds (not conjugated). This also fits.\n    *   So, a very strong candidate for mixture X is **{cyclohexene (C6H10), 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)}**.\n*   **Case n=7 (Z = methylcyclohexane):**\n    *   A and B must be unsaturated C7-ring compounds (not conjugated) with a methylcyclohexane skeleton.\n    *   Possible molecules are methylcyclohexene isomers (C7H12) and non-conjugated methylcyclohexadiene isomers (C7H10).\n    *   Let's check the total hydrogen atoms: 12 + 10 = 22. This matches our requirement for the C7 case.\n    *   This case is also chemically plausible.\n\n**Step 4: Resolve the ambiguity and find the final answer.**\nWe have two plausible scenarios, one leading to a total of 18 hydrogen atoms in X, and another leading to 22. Both 18 (Option A) and 22 (Option B) are available choices. Such problems in a chemistry context, when ambiguous, often rely on the most fundamental or common textbook example. The disproportionation/hydrogen transfer reactions involving the C6 system (cyclohexane/cyclohexene/cyclohexadiene/benzene) are canonical examples in organic chemistry. The C7 system, while valid, is a less fundamental example. Therefore, it is most probable that the question refers to the C6 system.\n\nLet's finalize with the C6 system:\n*   Mixture X contains cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n*   Total H atoms = (H atoms in cyclohexene) + (H atoms in 1,4-cyclohexadiene)\n*   Total H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon, let's denote its formula as CnHm.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen (%H) is given as 14.28%. This value is very close to 1/7.\n    *   Let's verify this assumption. %H = (Atomic Mass of H * m) / (Atomic Mass of C * n + Atomic Mass of H * m). Using approximate atomic masses (H=1, C=12):\n        %H = m / (12n + m) = 1/7\n        7m = 12n + m\n        6m = 12n\n        m = 2n\n    *   So, the general formula for Z is CnH2n. Since Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (it does not react further with hydrogen), it must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z is \"widely used as a solvent\". The most common cycloalkane solvent fitting this description is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n    *   Let's check the mass fraction for C6H12 using more precise masses (C≈12.01, H≈1.008):\n        %H = (12 * 1.008) / (6 * 12.01 + 12 * 1.008) * 100 = 12.096 / (72.06 + 12.096) * 100 = 12.096 / 84.156 * 100 ≈ 14.37%. The given 14.28% corresponds well to the CnH2n formula, and cyclohexane is the most logical candidate based on the chemical context. Thus, **Z is cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, C and D.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components either lack C=C/C≡C bonds (are saturated) or are aromatic.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y (both C and D) gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   Z (cyclohexane) is itself a constituent of mixture Y. Let's say **D = Z = cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n    *   The other component, C, must also hydrogenate to cyclohexane (Z). It must also not decolorize bromine water. A saturated isomer of cyclohexane (like methylcyclopentane) would not typically be described as \"hydrogenating\" to cyclohexane. A much better candidate is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene does not decolorize bromine water (it requires a Lewis acid catalyst for bromination) and it is hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions (high pressure/temperature), which is mentioned in the problem.\n    *   So, mixture **Y consists of benzene (C6H6) and cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction X → Y**\n    *   Mixture X (equimolar A + B) reacts upon heating with platinum to form mixture Y (equimolar C + D).\n    *   A + B → C + D\n    *   Substituting the identities of C and D: A + B → C6H6 + C6H12.\n    *   This is a disproportionation reaction, specifically a catalytic hydrogen transfer. One component of X is oxidized (loses hydrogen) to form benzene, and the other is reduced (gains hydrogen) to form cyclohexane.\n    *   By conservation of atoms, the total number of carbon and hydrogen atoms must be the same on both sides. All substances (A, B, C, D) have a C6 skeleton.\n        C6Hx + C6Hy → C6H6 + C6H12\n    *   This implies that the total number of hydrogen atoms is conserved: x + y = 6 + 12 = 18.\n\n4.  **Identify the Components of Mixture X**\n    *   Mixture X consists of two equimolar liquids, A (C6Hx) and B (C6Hy).\n    *   Mixture X *does* decolorize bromine water, so both A and B are unsaturated (they contain C=C bonds).\n    *   The problem states there are \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" in the molecules of X.\n    *   We need to find two unsaturated C6 cyclic hydrocarbons whose hydrogen counts (x and y) sum to 18.\n    *   Common unsaturated cyclic C6 hydrocarbons include:\n        *   Cyclohexene (C6H10)\n        *   Cyclohexadienes (C6H8)\n    *   Let's check if this pair works: x=10 and y=8. The sum is 10 + 8 = 18. This fits the requirement.\n    *   Therefore, mixture X consists of a cyclohexene and a cyclohexadiene.\n    *   The condition \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" rules out 1,3-cyclohexadiene but allows for **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**. **Cyclohexene (C6H10)** only has one double bond, so it also fits this condition.\n    *   The reaction is a hydrogen transfer between these two compounds. For example:\n        C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) + C6H10 (cyclohexene) --(Pt, heat)--> C6H6 (benzene) + C6H12 (cyclohexane)\n        In this specific balanced reaction, 1,4-cyclohexadiene loses 2H to become benzene, and cyclohexene gains 2H to become cyclohexane. This is a plausible 1:1 reaction that produces an equimolar mixture.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer**\n    *   The two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in C6H10) + (H atoms in C6H8) = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. Let's determine the empirical formula. The mass fraction of carbon is 100% - 14.28% = 85.72%.\n    *   Ratio of moles C : H = (85.72 / 12.01) : (14.28 / 1.008) ≈ 7.14 : 14.17\n    *   Divide by the smallest number (7.14): C : H ≈ 1 : 1.98 ≈ 1 : 2.\n    *   So, the empirical formula of Z is CH2.\n    *   Z is also described as not reacting further with hydrogen, which means it is a saturated hydrocarbon.\n    *   A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula (CH2)n must be a cycloalkane, with the general formula CnH2n. An acyclic alkane has the formula CnH(2n+2).\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in any cycloalkane CnH2n is (2n * 1) / (n * 12 + 2n * 1) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857, which matches the given 14.28%.\n    *   So, Z is a cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y and the Hydrogenation Reactions**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One of them is Z. Let's call the other one D. So, Y = {Z, D}.\n    *   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated (like cycloalkanes) or aromatic (like benzene and its derivatives), as these do not react with bromine water under normal conditions.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives *only* substance Z.\n        *   Hydrogenation of Z (a saturated cycloalkane) gives Z.\n        *   Therefore, hydrogenation of D must also give Z.\n    *   If D were a saturated isomer of Z (e.g., if Z is cyclohexane, D could be methylcyclopentane), it would not be described as a product of disproportionation involving hydrogen transfer, and its hydrogenation to Z would require isomerization, not just simple H2 addition.\n    *   A more plausible candidate for D is an aromatic compound with the same carbon skeleton as Z. Aromatic compounds do not decolorize bromine water and can be hydrogenated to the corresponding cycloalkane.\n    *   So, if Z = CnH2n, then D must be the corresponding aromatic compound, which would have the formula CnH(2n-6) (e.g., if Z is cyclohexane C6H12, D is benzene C6H6).\n    *   This fits all the criteria for Y: an equimolar mixture {CnH2n, CnH(2n-6)} would not decolorize bromine water, and its complete hydrogenation would yield only one product, CnH2n (Z).\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Disproportionation Reaction**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B. X = {A, B}.\n    *   X decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n    *   The reaction is: X → Y. Given the equimolar nature of both mixtures, the reaction is most likely A + B → Z + D.\n    *   This is a \"disproportionation\" reaction, which in this context means a hydrogen transfer reaction. One molecule gets reduced (gains H), and one gets oxidized (loses H).\n        *   A → Z (CnH2n)  OR  B → Z (CnH2n)\n        *   B → D (CnH(2n-6)) OR  A → D (CnH(2n-6))\n    *   Let's assume A is reduced and B is oxidized.\n        *   Oxidation: B → D + hydrogen. Specifically, B → CnH(2n-6).\n        *   Reduction: A + hydrogen → Z. Specifically, A → CnH2n.\n    *   The overall reaction is a hydrogen transfer: A + B → Z + D.\n    *   The problem states that hydrogenation of mixture X also gives only Z. This means both A and B, upon hydrogenation, yield Z. This confirms they both have the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n    *   A and B are therefore unsaturated cycloalkenes or cyclodienes. The problem states there are no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   Let's identify the most likely structures for A and B.\n        *   The substance that gets hydrogenated to a cycloalkane (Z, CnH2n) is most likely a cycloalkene with the formula CnH(2n-2). It gains 2H.\n        *   The substance that gets dehydrogenated to an aromatic compound (D, CnH(2n-6)) is most likely a non-conjugated cyclodiene with the formula CnH(2n-4). It loses 2H.\n    *   So, our reaction is: CnH(2n-2) + CnH(2n-4) → CnH2n + CnH(2n-6).\n    *   Let's check the hydrogen balance: (2n-2) + (2n-4) = 4n-6. And for the products: (2n) + (2n-6) = 4n-6. The reaction is perfectly balanced.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B.\n    *   Total H = (H in A) + (H in B) = (2n-2) + (2n-4) = 4n - 6.\n    *   Now we must find the value of 'n'. We can test the answer choices.\n        *   A) Total H = 12 → 4n - 6 = 12 → 4n = 18 → n = 4.5 (not an integer, so not possible).\n        *   B) Total H = 22 → 4n - 6 = 22 → 4n = 28 → n = 7. This is a possible solution.\n        *   C) Total H = 18 → 4n - 6 = 18 → 4n = 24 → n = 6. This is a possible solution.\n        *   D) Total H = 16 → 4n - 6 = 16 → 4n = 22 → n = 5.5 (not an integer, so not possible).\n\n5.  **Distinguish Between n=6 and n=7**\n    *   We have two plausible scenarios:\n        *   **n=6**: Z is cyclohexane (C6H12). X is a mixture of cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). The total H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n        *   **n=7**: Z is methylcyclohexane (C7H14). X is a mixture of a methylcyclohexene (C7H12) and a non-conjugated methylcyclohexadiene (C7H10). The total H atoms = 12 + 10 = 22.\n    *   Both scenarios are chemically sound and fit all the conditions. However, in the absence of any information suggesting a substituted ring (like a methyl group), the most fundamental and common example should be chosen. The reaction described is a classic catalytic hydrogen transfer, and its archetypal example involves the unsubstituted C6 ring system (cyclohexane/benzene/cyclohexene/cyclohexadiene). Therefore, the most reasonable choice is n=6.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation**\n    *   For n=6, the two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 (from C6H10) + 8 (from C6H8) = 18.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let's determine its empirical formula.\n    *   Mass fraction of H = 14.28% = 0.1428.\n    *   Mass fraction of C = 100% - 14.28% = 85.72% = 0.8572.\n    *   Let's find the molar ratio of C to H. Assuming a 100g sample, we have 14.28 g of H and 85.72 g of C.\n    *   Moles of H = 14.28 g / 1.008 g/mol ≈ 14.17 mol.\n    *   Moles of C = 85.72 g / 12.011 g/mol ≈ 7.14 mol.\n    *   The ratio of H to C is Moles H / Moles C ≈ 14.17 / 7.14 ≈ 1.985, which is approximately 2.\n    *   The empirical formula of Z is CH2.\n    *   The mass fraction 14.28% is very close to 1/7. A hydrocarbon with the general formula (CH2)n, i.e., CnH2n, has a mass fraction of hydrogen of `(2n * 1) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857`. This matches the given data.\n    *   Z is described as a substance that does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a saturated hydrocarbon. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclopentane (C5H10) and cyclohexane (C6H12). We will proceed with this information.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Hydrogenation Reactions**\n    *   Hydrogenation of both mixture X (composed of liquids A and B) and mixture Y (composed of liquids C and D) yields *only* substance Z.\n    *   This implies that all four substances (A, B, C, and D) have the same carbon skeleton as Z. Upon addition of hydrogen, they all convert to Z.\n\n3.  **Identify Mixture Y and Determine the Structure of Z**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (C and D) and it does not decolorize bromine water. This indicates that C and D are saturated or aromatic compounds.\n    *   Z is a constituent of mixture Y. Let's say C = Z. Since Z is a cycloalkane (saturated), it does not decolorize bromine water, which is consistent.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z. The component C=Z is already saturated and won't react. Therefore, component D must be hydrogenated to Z: `D --(H2, Pt, severe conditions)--> Z`.\n    *   Since D does not decolorize bromine water but can be hydrogenated, it must be an aromatic compound. The hydrogenation conditions are described as \"rather severe,\" which is characteristic of the hydrogenation of aromatic rings.\n    *   Let's assume Z is cyclohexane (C6H12). Its carbon skeleton is a six-membered ring. Then D must be an aromatic compound with a six-membered ring skeleton, which is benzene (C6H6).\n    *   Hydrogenation of benzene gives cyclohexane: `C6H6 + 3H2 --> C6H12`. This is consistent.\n    *   So, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C = Z = C6H12) and benzene (D = C6H6). Both are liquids at room temperature and cyclohexane is a common solvent. Benzene does not react with bromine water without a catalyst. This hypothesis fits all the conditions for Y and Z.\n\n4.  **Identify Mixture X**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (A and B).\n    *   It decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and/or B contain non-aromatic double or triple bonds.\n    *   The problem states a disproportionation reaction occurs: `Mixture X --(Pt, heat)--> Mixture Y`.\n    *   Since the mixtures are equimolar, the reaction stoichiometry is likely 1:1 -> 1:1. So, `A + B --> C + D`.\n    *   Substituting our identified C and D: `A + B --> C6H12 + C6H6`.\n    *   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. The total atoms must be conserved. The sum of the formulas for A and B must be C12H18.\n    *   Since A and B both hydrogenate to Z (cyclohexane, C6H12), they must both be C6 hydrocarbons with a six-membered ring skeleton. Let their formulas be A = C6Hx and B = C6Hy.\n    *   From the atom balance, we have x + y = 18.\n    *   We also know A and B must be unsaturated (to decolorize bromine water) and must not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   Possible unsaturated C6 cyclic hydrocarbons with a six-membered ring are:\n        *   Cyclohexene (C6H10). It has one double bond, so no conjugation. It decolorizes bromine water.\n        *   Cyclohexadienes (C6H8). There are two isomers: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated).\n    *   The problem states \"no conjugated multiple bonds,\" so 1,3-cyclohexadiene is ruled out.\n    *   This leaves us with cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) as the candidates for A and B.\n    *   Let's check if this pair fits the condition x + y = 18.\n    *   If A = C6H10 and B = C6H8, then x = 10 and y = 8. The sum is 10 + 8 = 18. This is a perfect match.\n    *   So, mixture X consists of cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene. The disproportionation reaction is: `C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) --> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)`. This reaction is balanced and represents the transfer of two hydrogen atoms from 1,4-cyclohexadiene to cyclohexene.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This refers to the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of the first liquid (A) and one molecule of the second liquid (B).\n    *   Liquid A is cyclohexene, C6H10. It has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Liquid B is 1,4-cyclohexadiene, C6H8. It has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CxHy. The mass fraction of H is `(y * 1) / (x * 12 + y * 1)`, using integer atomic masses.\n    *   `y / (12x + y) = 0.1428`. This value is very close to 1/7 (`1/7 ≈ 0.142857`). Let's assume the intended value is 1/7.\n    *   `y / (12x + y) = 1/7` => `7y = 12x + y` => `6y = 12x` => `y = 2x`.\n    *   The general formula for Z is CnH2n.\n    *   Z does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is a saturated hydrocarbon. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Z is also described as being widely used as a solvent. Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclohexane (C6H12) and methylcyclohexane (C7H14), both of which fit the CnH2n formula.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, C and D.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water, which means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only substance Z.\n    *   Z is a constituent of mixture Y. Let's say C is Z. So, C is a cycloalkane, CnH2n.\n    *   Since hydrogenation of D also produces Z (CnH2n), D must be an unsaturated hydrocarbon with the same carbon skeleton as Z. Because D does not decolorize bromine water, it must be an aromatic hydrocarbon (an arene).\n    *   The simplest aromatic hydrocarbon is benzene (C6H6). If n=6, Z would be cyclohexane (C6H12), and D would be benzene (C6H6). This fits the criteria: Y = {cyclohexane, benzene}. Neither decolorizes bromine water, and hydrogenation of benzene gives cyclohexane.\n    *   If n=7, Z would be methylcyclohexane (C7H14), and D would be toluene (methylbenzene, C7H8). This also fits the criteria.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Reaction**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B.\n    *   X decolorizes bromine water, so A and/or B must contain C=C or C≡C bonds.\n    *   Hydrogenation of X gives only Z (the cycloalkane CnH2n). This means A and B are unsaturated hydrocarbons with the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n    *   The molecules in X have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   The reaction X → Y is described as a disproportionation. Y is an equimolar mixture. This suggests the reaction stoichiometry is `A + B → C + D`. This type of reaction, involving hydrogen transfer between molecules, is common over platinum catalysts and is often broadly referred to as disproportionation in this context.\n\n4.  **Determine the Composition of Mixture X**\n    *   The reaction is `A + B → C + D`. We have established that C is a cycloalkane (CnH2n) and D is an arene (likely CnH(2n-6) for a monocyclic system).\n    *   Let's balance the hydrogen atoms: `H_atoms(A) + H_atoms(B) = H_atoms(C) + H_atoms(D)`\n        `H_atoms(A) + H_atoms(B) = (2n) + (2n - 6) = 4n - 6`.\n    *   A and B are unsaturated versions of Z (CnH2n). They are likely a cycloalkene (CnH(2n-2)) and a cycloalkadiene (CnH(2n-4)).\n    *   Let's check if this fits the hydrogen balance: `(2n - 2) + (2n - 4) = 4n - 6`. This is a perfect match.\n    *   So, mixture X consists of a cycloalkene (CnH(2n-2)) and a non-conjugated cycloalkadiene (CnH(2n-4)).\n\n5.  **Identify the Specific Compounds and Solve the Question**\n    *   We have two plausible scenarios depending on the value of n. The smallest possible value for n is 6, as benzene (C6H6) is the smallest neutral aromatic hydrocarbon.\n    *   **Case 1: n = 6**\n        *   Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12)\n        *   Y = {Cyclohexane (C6H12), Benzene (C6H6)}\n        *   A = Cyclohexene (C6H(2*6-2) = C6H10)\n        *   B = A non-conjugated cyclohexadiene, which is 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H(2*6-4) = C6H8).\n        *   This scenario fits all the conditions of the problem.\n    *   **Case 2: n = 7**\n        *   Z = Methylcyclohexane (C7H14)\n        *   Y = {Methylcyclohexane (C7H14), Toluene (C7H8)}\n        *   A = A methylcyclohexene (C7H12)\n        *   B = A non-conjugated methylcyclohexadiene (C7H10).\n        *   This scenario also fits all the conditions.\n\n6.  **Distinguishing Between the Cases**\n    *   We have two potential answers for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X:\n        *   Case 1 (n=6): H atoms = 10 (from C6H10) + 8 (from C6H8) = 18.\n        *   Case 2 (n=7): H atoms = 12 (from C7H12) + 10 (from C7H10) = 22.\n    *   Both 18 and 22 are given as options (C and B). Chemistry problems of this type usually have a single correct answer. The C6 system (cyclohexane/benzene) is the most fundamental and \"textbook\" example of this type of chemistry. In the absence of information that would invalidate it or point specifically to a higher homolog, the simplest case is the intended answer.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation**\n    *   Based on the most plausible C6 scenario:\n    *   Liquid 1 in X is cyclohexene, C6H10. It has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Liquid 2 in X is 1,4-cyclohexadiene, C6H8. It has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze Substance Z**\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon with the general formula CxHy.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%. Let's calculate the empirical formula.\n    *   Mass % of H = 14.28% = 0.1428\n    *   Mass % of C = 100% - 14.28% = 85.72%\n    *   Molar ratio C:H = (85.72 / 12.01) : (14.28 / 1.008) = 7.13 : 14.17 ≈ 1:2.\n*   The empirical formula is CH2.\n*   The molecular formula of a stable hydrocarbon with this ratio is CnH2n. This corresponds to the general formula for cycloalkanes or alkenes.\n*   The problem states that Z is formed by hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n*   The problem also states Z is a widely used solvent and a liquid.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction and Mixture Y**\n*   Mixture Y is formed from mixture X by heating with platinum. Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n*   Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated (alkanes, cycloalkanes) or aromatic.\n*   We know one component of Y is Z, the cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n*   The reaction from X to Y is a disproportionation, which in this context (Pt catalyst, formation of a saturated compound) implies a catalytic hydrogen transfer. One substance is hydrogenated (reduced) to Z, and another must be dehydrogenated (oxidized).\n*   For the resulting mixture Y to not decolorize bromine water, the dehydrogenated product must be stable and unreactive to Br2 water. The most common examples are aromatic compounds.\n*   Therefore, mixture Y consists of an equimolar mixture of a cycloalkane (Z, CnH2n) and an aromatic compound. The aromatic compound must have the same carbon skeleton as Z, which is formed upon its full hydrogenation.\n\n**3. Identify the Carbon Skeleton and the Components**\n*   The hydrogenation of *both* mixtures X and Y yields *only* substance Z. This is a crucial point that confirms all compounds in X and Y share the same carbon skeleton.\n*   Let's consider the most common example of this type of reaction, which involves a six-membered ring.\n    *   If n=6, Z is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. This fits the CnH2n formula, is a very common solvent, and is a liquid.\n    *   The corresponding aromatic compound with a C6 skeleton is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene does not decolorize bromine water.\n    *   Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **benzene (C6H6)** and **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n**4. Analyze Mixture X**\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n*   X decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C bonds).\n*   Hydrogenation of A and B must both yield Z (cyclohexane). This means A and B are unsaturated compounds with a C6H12 carbon skeleton. They are likely cyclohexene or a cyclohexadiene.\n*   The transformation from X to Y is a reaction where the components of X form the components of Y. Since Y is an equimolar mixture of benzene and cyclohexane, the reaction can be written as:\n    A + B → C6H6 + C6H12\n*   By the law of conservation of mass, the atoms must balance. Both A and B have 6 carbons, so the carbon atoms are balanced (6+6 → 6+6). Let the formula of A be C6Hx and B be C6Hy. The hydrogen atoms must also balance:\n    x + y = 6 + 12\n    x + y = 18\n*   This means the total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of compound A and one molecule of compound B is 18.\n*   Let's find plausible identities for A and B.\n    *   They are unsaturated cyclohexanes. A stable unsaturated cyclic C6 hydrocarbon can be cyclohexene (C6H10) or a cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   If A is C6H10 and B is C6H8, then the sum of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. This fits our deduction.\n    *   So, Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and a **cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n    *   The problem states there are *no conjugated multiple bonds* in the compounds of mixture X. Cyclohexene has one double bond, so no conjugation. For cyclohexadiene, there are two isomers: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated). Therefore, the diene must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene**.\n    *   Mixture X = {Cyclohexene, 1,4-Cyclohexadiene}. Both are liquids and will decolorize bromine water.\n\n**5. Final Verification**\n*   **X** = {C6H10, C6H8} (equimolar, liquids, unsaturated, non-conjugated). Check.\n*   **Reaction** X → Y: C6H10 + C6H8 --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 + C6H6. This is a hydrogen transfer reaction where cyclohexene is hydrogenated and 1,4-cyclohexadiene is dehydrogenated. It produces an equimolar mixture. Check.\n*   **Y** = {C6H12, C6H6} (equimolar, do not decolorize Br2 water). Check.\n*   **Z** = C6H12 (constituent of Y, widely used solvent, CnH2n, %H=14.28%). Check.\n*   **Hydrogenation of X**: C6H10 and C6H8 both hydrogenate to C6H12. Gives only Z. Check.\n*   **Hydrogenation of Y**: C6H6 and C6H12 both yield C6H12 under hydrogenation. Gives only Z. Check.\n\nThe logic is consistent. The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This corresponds to the sum of hydrogens in one molecule of each component.\n\nNumber of H atoms = (H in C6H10) + (H in C6H8) = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon, containing only carbon (C) and hydrogen (H).\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given as 14.28%. Let the formula be CₙHₘ.\n    *   The mass fraction of H is `(m * M_H) / (n * M_C + m * M_H)`, where M_H and M_C are the atomic masses of hydrogen and carbon, respectively.\n    *   Using integer atomic masses (H=1, C=12), the formula becomes `m / (12n + m) = 0.1428`.\n    *   Let's test the general formulas for hydrocarbons:\n        *   Alkanes (CₙH₂ₙ₊₂): H% = (2n+2) / (12n + 2n+2) = (2n+2) / (14n+2). For n=1, 4/16=25%. For large n, H% approaches 2/14 ≈ 14.3%.\n        *   Alkenes/Cycloalkanes (CₙH₂ₙ): H% = 2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857.\n        *   Alkynes (CₙH₂ₙ₋₂): H% will be lower.\n    *   The mass fraction 14.28% is very close to 1/7, which corresponds to the general formula CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   The problem states that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (\"does not react further with hydrogen\"). A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane).\n\n2.  **Relate all compounds via the carbon skeleton**\n    *   Hydrogenation of both mixture X (compounds A and B) and mixture Y (compounds C and D) gives *only* substance Z.\n    *   This is a crucial clue. It means that all four compounds A, B, C, and D, as well as Z itself, share the same carbon skeleton. When they are fully saturated with hydrogen, they all become Z.\n\n3.  **Identify Mixture Y and Z**\n    *   Mixture Y is formed by the disproportionation of mixture X over a heated platinum catalyst. It is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (C and D) that does not decolorize bromine water.\n    *   Disproportionation of cyclic unsaturated hydrocarbons over platinum (a reaction known as Zelinzky irreversible catalysis) typically involves hydrogen transfer, where some molecules are hydrogenated and others are dehydrogenated to form a stable aromatic system.\n    *   Substance Z is a cycloalkane (CₙH₂ₙ) and is a constituent of mixture Y. Let's say C = Z = CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   Since C is the hydrogenated product, its partner D must be the dehydrogenated product. The final, most stable dehydrogenated product of a cycloalkane skeleton is the corresponding aromatic compound.\n    *   Mixture Y = {a cycloalkane (Z), an aromatic compound}.\n    *   Let's consider the simplest and most common case, a 6-membered ring skeleton.\n        *   Z would be **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This fits the description of a widely used solvent with formula CₙH₂ₙ.\n        *   The corresponding aromatic compound is **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n        *   So, a very strong candidate for mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (Z) and benzene**.\n        *   Let's check: Y = {C₆H₁₂, C₆H₆}. Both are liquids. Neither decolorizes bromine water under normal conditions. This fits the description of Y perfectly. Hydrogenation of benzene gives cyclohexane, so hydrogenation of this mixture gives only cyclohexane (Z). This also fits.\n\n4.  **Identify Mixture X**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (A and B) that decolorizes bromine water (i.e., they are unsaturated) and has no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   The reaction `A + B --(Pt, heat)--> C + D` must be balanced. With Y = {cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + benzene (C₆H₆)}, the total formula of the products is C₁₂H₁₈. Therefore, the reactants A+B must also have the total formula C₁₂H₁₈.\n    *   A and B must have the same C₆ ring skeleton. We are looking for two different unsaturated C₆-ring compounds whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18.\n    *   Possible C₆ unsaturated ring compounds (non-conjugated):\n        *   **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)**: one double bond.\n        *   **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**: two isolated double bonds (1,3-cyclohexadiene is conjugated and thus excluded).\n    *   Let's check the sum of their hydrogen atoms: 10 + 8 = 18. This matches exactly.\n    *   Therefore, mixture X is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   The disproportionation reaction is:\n        C₆H₈ (1,4-cyclohexadiene) + C₆H₁₀ (cyclohexene) → C₆H₆ (benzene) + C₆H₁₂ (cyclohexane)\n        In this hydrogen transfer, the diene loses 2H to become benzene, and the monoene gains those 2H to become cyclohexane. This reaction produces an equimolar mixture Y.\n\n5.  **Verify all conditions**\n    *   X = {C₆H₁₀, C₆H₈}. Equimolar mixture of two liquids.

An analogous C₇-based system {methylcyclohexene, methylcyclohexadiene} is also possible and would lead to an answer of 22, but the cyclohexane/benzene system is the most fundamental and classic example of this type of reaction.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Answer**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   The two liquids are cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈).\n    *   Number of H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexene = 10.\n    *   Number of H atoms in one molecule of 1,4-cyclohexadiene = 8.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   Let the formula of Z be CnHm. The mass fraction of hydrogen is approximately `m / (12n + m)`.\n    *   `14.28%` is equivalent to `0.1428`, which is very close to the fraction `1/7`.\n    *   Let's test this: `m / (12n + m) = 1/7` => `7m = 12n + m` => `6m = 12n` => `m = 2n`.\n    *   So, the general formula for Z is CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (it does not react further with hydrogen). A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem also states that Z is \"widely used as a solvent\". Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclopentane (C5H10), cyclohexane (C6H12), and methylcyclohexane (C7H14). All of these fit the CnH2n formula.\n    *   The crucial clue is that hydrogenation of both mixtures X and Y gives *only one* substance, Z. This means that all reactive components in both mixtures must share the same carbon skeleton, which upon saturation, yields Z.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n    *   It \"does not decolorize bromine water\", which typically means it contains saturated compounds (alkanes or cycloalkanes) and is not aromatic, or at least does not contain simple alkenes/alkynes.\n    *   Substance Z is a constituent of mixture Y. So, one component of Y is Z, the cycloalkane CnH2n.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z. If Y consists of `Y1` and `Y2`, and `Y1 = Z`, then hydrogenation of `Y2` must also yield Z.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Disproportionation Reaction (X → Y)**\n    *   Mixture X is transformed into mixture Y upon heating with a platinum catalyst. This is described as a disproportionation.\n    *   A disproportionation reaction in organic chemistry is typically a redox reaction where a substance is simultaneously oxidized (loses hydrogen or gains oxygen) and reduced (gains hydrogen or loses oxygen). For hydrocarbons, this usually means hydrogen transfer.\n    *   So, some component(s) in X are reduced, and some are oxidized to form the components of Y.\n    *   Let the two components of X be `X1 (CnH_a)` and `X2 (CnH_b)`.\n    *   Let the two components of Y be `Y1 (CnH_c)` and `Y2 (CnH_d)`.\n    *   Since X and Y are both equimolar mixtures, the overall reaction stoichiometry is likely `X1 + X2 → Y1 + Y2`.\n    *   By the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms must be the same on both sides. `C(2n)H(a+b) → C(2n)H(c+d)`. This means `a + b = c + d`.\n\n4.  **Revisiting Mixture Y and a Key Interpretation**\n    *   Initially, one might assume that because Y is \"saturated,\" both components must be cycloalkanes (e.g., Y1=cyclohexane, Y2=methylcyclopentane). This would mean `c=d=2n`. This leads to `a+b = 4n`.\n    *   However, mixture X \"decolorizes bromine water\", meaning its components are unsaturated. Thus, `a < 2n` and `b < 2n`. This leads to a contradiction: `a+b` must be less than `4n`.\n    *   This contradiction suggests a flaw in the interpretation. The key lies in the phrase \"does not decolorize bromine water\". While this strictly means saturated, in the context of many chemistry problems, it's used to distinguish reactive alkenes/alkynes from the less reactive aromatic compounds. Benzene does not react with bromine water under normal conditions (it requires a Lewis acid catalyst). Let's test the hypothesis that one of the products in Y is aromatic.\n    *   Let's assume the reaction is a classic hydrogen transfer producing a cycloalkane and an aromatic ring.\n    *   Let `Y1 = Z = CnH2n` (a cycloalkane).\n    *   Let `Y2` be the corresponding aromatic compound, `Cn H(n)` (e.g., if n=6, benzene C6H6). This fits the `m=n` for typical aromatic rings like benzene, though more accurately `C6H6` hydrogenates to `C6H12`. Let's test with `n=6`, which is the most common for these reactions.\n    *   So let's hypothesize: `Z = cyclohexane (C6H12)`.\n    *   And `Y = {cyclohexane (C6H12), benzene (C6H6)}`.\n    *   Let's check if this Y fits the description:\n        *   Equimolar mixture of two liquids: Yes.\n        *   \"Does not decolorize bromine water\": Plausible under this interpretation.\n        *   Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z: Hydrogenation of cyclohexane gives cyclohexane. Hydrogenation of benzene gives cyclohexane. Yes, this works.\n        *   Z is a constituent of Y: Yes, cyclohexane is present.\n\n5.  **Determine the Composition of Mixture X**\n    *   If `Y = {cyclohexane (C6H12), benzene (C6H6)}`, the total formula of the products (`Y1+Y2`) is `C12H18`.\n    *   Therefore, the total formula of the reactants (`X1+X2`) must also be `C12H18`.\n    *   So, for `X1 (C6Ha)` and `X2 (C6Hb)`, we must have `a + b = 18`.\n    *   Now we need to find two different liquids, X1 and X2, that fit the remaining conditions:\n        *   They must be C6 compounds.\n        *   They must be unsaturated (decolorize Br2 water).\n        *   They must not contain conjugated multiple bonds.\n        *   They must both hydrogenate to give only cyclohexane.\n    *   Let's choose a pair of molecules with `a+b=18`. A good candidate pair is one with 10 hydrogens and one with 8 hydrogens.\n        *   **X1 = C6H10**: A C6 alkene. **Cyclohexene** fits perfectly. It is a liquid, unsaturated, not conjugated, and its hydrogenation product is cyclohexane.\n        *   **X2 = C6H8**: A C6 diene. To satisfy the \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" rule, we can't use cyclohexa-1,3-diene. However, **cyclohexa-1,4-diene** fits perfectly. It is a liquid, unsaturated, non-conjugated, and its hydrogenation product is cyclohexane.\n    *   So, a viable composition for mixture X is `{cyclohexene, cyclohexa-1,4-diene}`.\n\n6.  **Verify the Reaction**\n    *   The proposed transformation is:\n        `C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (cyclohexa-1,4-diene) --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)`\n    *   This reaction is a plausible intermolecular hydrogen transfer (disproportionation). The cyclohexene is reduced to cyclohexane, and the cyclohexa-1,4-diene is oxidized to benzene.\n    *   All conditions of the problem are satisfied with this model.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Answer**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   The two liquids are cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8).\n    *   Total H atoms = 10 (from C6H10) + 8 (from C6H8) = 18.\n\nFinal Answer Check: The options are A) 16, B) 12, C) 22, D) 18. Our calculated value is 18, which matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%. Let's determine the empirical formula of Z (CxHy).\n        The mass fraction of H is given by: `mass%(H) = (y * Ar(H)) / (x * Ar(C) + y * Ar(H))`.\n        Using approximate atomic masses (C=12, H=1), we get: `0.1428 ≈ y / (12x + y)`.\n        This fraction is very close to 1/7 (`1/7 ≈ 0.142857`).\n        So, `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`\n        `7y = 12x + y`\n        `6y = 12x`\n        `y = 2x`\n    *   The empirical formula is CH2. The general molecular formula is (CH2)n, or CnH2n.\n    *   This formula corresponds to either an alkene (C=C bond) or a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z is a product of hydrogenation under severe conditions and \"does not react further with hydrogen\". This means Z is a saturated hydrocarbon.\n    *   Therefore, Z must be a **cycloalkane** with the formula **CnH2n**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n    *   It \"does not decolorize bromine water\". This means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   One component of Y is Z itself, which is a saturated cycloalkane (CnH2n). Let's call this Y1. So, Y1 = Z = CnH2n.\n    *   Mixture Y is formed from mixture X by \"disproportionation\" using a platinum catalyst and heat. Disproportionation is a redox reaction. In hydrocarbon chemistry, this often involves hydrogen transfer, where one molecule is hydrogenated (reduced) and another is dehydrogenated (oxidized).\n    *   The hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only substance Z. This means the other component of Y (let's call it Y2) must also have the same carbon skeleton as Z. Upon hydrogenation, Y2 becomes Z.\n    *   Since Y2 has the same carbon skeleton (a C-n ring) and must be formed by dehydrogenation, it is most likely an aromatic compound. The formula for a simple aromatic compound derived from a CnH2n cycloalkane is **CnH2n-6**. For example, cyclohexane (C6H12) is related to benzene (C6H6). Methylcyclohexane (C7H14) is related to toluene (methylbenzene, C7H8). Aromatic compounds like benzene and toluene do not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions.\n    *   So, Mixture Y consists of **CnH2n** (Z) and **CnH2n-6** in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Reaction**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them X1 and X2.\n    *   X \"decolorizes bromine water\", meaning its components have C=C double bonds. They are unsaturated.\n    *   Hydrogenation of X gives only Z (CnH2n). This confirms that X1 and X2 also have the same CnH- carbon skeleton as Z. They are therefore cycloalkenes or cycloalkadienes.\n    *   The problem states \"There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X\". This gives a specific structural constraint.\n    *   The reaction `Mixture X -> Mixture Y` is a 1:1 molar reaction, as an *equimolar* mixture X forms an *equimolar* mixture Y. This implies the stoichiometry is `X1 + X2 -> Y1 + Y2`.\n        `X1 + X2 -> CnH2n + CnH2n-6`\n    *   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component of X is reduced to CnH2n, while the other is oxidized to CnH2n-6. For this to work, X1 must be more hydrogenated than Y2 (the aromatic) and X2 must be more hydrogenated than Y2. Also, X1 must be less hydrogenated than Y1 (the cycloalkane). The most logical combination for X1 and X2, which are non-conjugated and have a CnH- skeleton, is a cycloalkene (**CnH2n-2**) and a non-conjugated cycloalkadiene (**CnH2n-4**).\n\n4.  **Balance the Reaction and Find the Solution**\n    *   Let's check if this combination works:\n        `X1 (CnH2n-4) + X2 (CnH2n-2) -> Y1 (CnH2n) + Y2 (CnH2n-6)` (The order of X1, X2 is arbitrary).\n        This does not balance.\n    *   Let's rethink the hydrogen transfer. The overall process must be balanced. Let the hydrogen counts in X1 and X2 be `a` and `b`. The reaction is:\n        `CnH_a + CnH_b -> CnH2n + CnH2n-6`\n        The hydrogen atoms must balance: `a + b = 2n + (2n - 6) = 4n - 6`.\n    *   The question asks for \"the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X\", which corresponds to `a + b`. So we need to find the value of `4n - 6`.\n    *   We have to determine 'n'. The problem mentions Z is \"widely used as a solvent\". Both cyclohexane (n=6) and methylcyclohexane (n=7) fit this description and the CnH2n formula with H% ≈ 14.3%. The reaction scheme is plausible for both. In the absence of further information, the most fundamental and simplest example is usually intended. The C6 system (cyclohexane/benzene) is the parent system for this type of chemistry. Let's assume **n=6**.\n        *   Z = Cyclohexane, C6H12\n        *   Y = Equimolar mixture of Cyclohexane (C6H12) and Benzene (C6H6).\n        *   X must be an equimolar mixture of C6 compounds that can react to form Y. Based on our model:\n            *   `X1` would be a cyclohexadiene, C6H8. To be non-conjugated, it must be **cyclohexa-1,4-diene**.\n            *   `X2` would be a cyclohexene, C6H10. The only one is **cyclohexene**.\n        *   The reaction is: `C6H8 + C6H10 -> C6H6 + C6H12`. This is a balanced hydrogen transfer.\n        *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each of the two liquids in mixture X is the sum of hydrogens in C6H8 and C6H10.\n        *   Total H atoms = 8 + 10 = 18.\n\n    *   Alternatively, using the formula `4n - 6`:\n        For n=6, Total H = 4(6) - 6 = 24 - 6 = 18.\n\n5.  **Check the Options**\n    *   The calculated value is 18.\n    *   The given options are A) 18, B) 22, C) 16, D) 12.\n    *   Our result matches option A.\n\n    (Note: If we had chosen n=7, the total H atoms would be 4(7) - 6 = 22, which is option B. However, the C6 system is the most classic and fundamental example for this type of problem.)\n\nThe final answer is the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two molecules of mixture X. This is 18.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n    *   The mass fraction is calculated as `(mass of H) / (total mass)`. Let's use atomic masses C ≈ 12 and H ≈ 1.\n    *   For a general hydrocarbon `CnHm`, the mass fraction of H is `m / (12n + m)`.\n    *   Let's test the given percentage: 14.28% is approximately equal to the fraction 1/7.\n    *   Let's see which hydrocarbon formula class fits `m / (12n + m) = 1/7`.\n    *   Cross-multiplying gives `7m = 12n + m`, which simplifies to `6m = 12n`, or `m = 2n`.\n    *   The general formula `CnH2n` corresponds to either an alkene (with one double bond) or a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z is formed by hydrogenating other substances and that Z itself \"does not react further with hydrogen.\" This means Z must be a saturated compound. An alkene is unsaturated, while a cycloalkane is saturated.\n    *   Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane with the formula `CnH2n`.\n    *   Z is also described as a \"widely used as a solvent.\" Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclopentane (C5H10) and cyclohexane (C6H12).\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n    *   Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids formed from the disproportionation of X.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water, which means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only one substance, Z.\n    *   Z itself is one of the components of Y.\n    *   Let the two components of Y be Y1 and Y2. We can set `Y1 = Z = CnH2n` (the cycloalkane).\n    *   The other component, Y2, must also hydrogenate to Z (`CnH2n`). This means Y2 must have the same carbon skeleton (n carbon atoms in a ring).\n    *   Since Y2 does not decolorize bromine water, but can be hydrogenated, it must be an aromatic compound. The hydrogenation of aromatic rings requires severe conditions, which matches the problem description.\n    *   The most common and stable aromatic ring structure is benzene (C6H6). If Y2 is benzene, then n=6.\n    *   This implies that `Z = C6H12` (cyclohexane) and `Y2 = C6H6` (benzene).\n    *   This is a very plausible scenario: Z=cyclohexane is a widely used solvent, and its hydrogenation gives itself. Y2=benzene does not decolorize bromine water and its hydrogenation under severe conditions gives cyclohexane.\n    *   So, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6).\n\n3.  **Relate Mixture X to Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2.\n    *   When heated with platinum, X undergoes disproportionation to form the equimolar mixture Y. A disproportionation is a redox reaction where a species is simultaneously oxidized and reduced. In this context (Pt catalyst), it's a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component is dehydrogenated (oxidized) and another is hydrogenated (reduced).\n    *   The reaction is: `X1 + X2 -> Y1 + Y2`.\n    *   Since X and Y are equimolar mixtures, the stoichiometry is `1 molecule of X1 + 1 molecule of X2 -> 1 molecule of Y1 + 1 molecule of Y2`.\n    *   Substituting the components of Y we identified: `X1 + X2 -> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)`.\n\n4.  **Determine the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms in X**\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This confirms that both X1 and X2 have the same C6-ring carbon skeleton as cyclohexane. So their formulas are `C6Hx` and `C6Hy`.\n    *   Based on the principle of conservation of mass for the disproportionation reaction, the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the equation.\n    *   Looking at the hydrogen atoms: `(Number of H in X1) + (Number of H in X2) = (Number of H in C6H12) + (Number of H in C6H6)`.\n    *   Total H in X = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   The question asks for the \"total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X\", which corresponds to this sum.\n\n5.  **Verification (Optional but recommended)**\n    *   Let's check if we can find plausible structures for X1 and X2.\n    *   `X1 = C6Hx`, `X2 = C6Hy`, with `x+y=18`.\n    *   Both must decolorize bromine water, meaning they are unsaturated (contain C=C bonds).\n    *   They must not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   Possible unsaturated C6-ring compounds are cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexadienes (C6H8).\n    *   Let's try `X1 = Cyclohexene (C6H10)` and `X2 = Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)`.\n        *   Does x+y=18? Yes, 10 + 8 = 18.\n        *   Does cyclohexene decolorize bromine water? Yes.\n        *   Does cyclohexa-1,4-diene decolorize bromine water? Yes.\n        *   Does it have conjugated bonds? No, the double bonds at positions 1 and 4 are isolated. (Cyclohexa-1,3-diene has conjugated bonds and is excluded by the problem statement).\n        *   The reaction `C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (cyclohexa-1,4-diene) -> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)` is a balanced hydrogen transfer reaction. Cyclohexene is dehydrogenated to benzene, and the diene is hydrogenated to cyclohexane. This is chemically reasonable over a Pt catalyst.\n    *   This successful identification of X1 and X2 confirms our stoichiometric calculation.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each of the two liquids in mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance Z**\n\n1.  Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n    The mass fraction of hydrogen in a hydrocarbon CnHm is given by `m / (12n + m)`.\n    `m / (12n + m) = 0.1428`\n    This value is very close to 1/7 (`1/7 ≈ 0.142857`).\n    `m / (12n + m) = 1/7`\n    `7m = 12n + m`\n    `6m = 12n`\n    `m = 2n`\n    So, the general formula for Z is `CnH2n`.\n\n2.  Z is formed by the hydrogenation of other compounds (from mixtures X and Y) and does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a saturated hydrocarbon.\n\n3.  The general formula for a saturated acyclic hydrocarbon (alkane) is `CnH(2n+2)`. The general formula for a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon (cycloalkane) is `CnH2n`.\n\n4.  Since the formula for Z is `CnH2n` and it is saturated, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n\n5.  Z is also described as a widely used solvent. A very common cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. Let's assume Z is cyclohexane. The carbon skeleton of all compounds involved must therefore be a six-membered ring.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Mixture Y**\n\n1.  Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that is formed from mixture X.\n2.  Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated (like alkanes/cycloalkanes) or aromatic. They cannot be alkenes or alkynes.\n3.  Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only one substance, Z (cyclohexane).\n4.  One component of Y is Z itself (cyclohexane, C6H12), as stated in the problem.\n5.  The other component of Y must also hydrogenate to form cyclohexane. For it to not be an alkene but still react with hydrogen under severe conditions, it must be an aromatic compound. The only aromatic compound with a 6-carbon skeleton is **benzene (C6H6)**.\n6.  The hydrogenation of benzene produces cyclohexane: `C6H6 + 3H2 -> C6H12`.\n7.  Thus, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **benzene (C6H6)** and **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. This fits the description, as neither readily decolorizes bromine water, and hydrogenating the mixture (hydrogenating the benzene and leaving the cyclohexane unreacted) yields pure cyclohexane.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Mixture X and the Reaction**\n\n1.  Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water, meaning at least one (and likely both, based on the phrasing) of its components is an alkene.\n2.  The components of X do not have conjugated multiple bonds. This rules out 1,3-cyclohexadiene.\n3.  The hydrogenation of mixture X gives only cyclohexane (Z), so both components of X must be C6 cyclic compounds that can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane.\n4.  The reaction from X to Y is described as a disproportionation. In this context, it means a hydrogen transfer reaction where one component is oxidized (loses hydrogen) and another is reduced (gains hydrogen).\n    `Mixture X (A+B) --(Pt, heat)--> Mixture Y (Benzene + Cyclohexane)`\n5.  We need to find two C6 cyclic alkenes (A and B) that can react in a 1:1 molar ratio to produce benzene and cyclohexane in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n    Let A be oxidized to benzene (C6H6).\n    Let B be reduced to cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    The reaction would be a hydrogen transfer: `A + B -> C6H6 + C6H12`.\n6.  For the atom count to balance, the total atoms in `A + B` must equal the total atoms in `C6H6 + C6H12` (which is C12H18).\n7.  The logical candidates for A and B (non-conjugated C6 cyclic alkenes) are **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n8.  Let's check if they fit the reaction:\n    `C6H8 + C6H10 -> C6H6 + C6H12`\n    Reactants: C: 6+6=12, H: 8+10=18 -> C12H18\n    Products: C: 6+6=12, H: 6+12=18 -> C12H18\n    The stoichiometry is balanced.\n9.  In this reaction, 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) is oxidized to benzene (C6H6) by losing two hydrogen atoms. Cyclohexene (C6H10) is reduced to cyclohexane (C6H12) by gaining two hydrogen atoms. This is a plausible catalytic hydrogen transfer.\n10. So, Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)** and **cyclohexene (C6H10)**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of the hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n-   Component 1: Cyclohexene (C6H10) has **10** hydrogen atoms.\n-   Component 2: 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) has **8** hydrogen atoms.\n\nTotal number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon, so its formula is CxHy.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is given as 14.28%, which is equivalent to 0.1428.\n    *   The mass fraction of H can be calculated as `Mass_H / Total_Mass = (y * 1.008) / (x * 12.011 + y * 1.008)`. For simplicity, using integer masses (H=1, C=12), the formula is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   `y / (12x + y) = 0.1428`\n    *   Let's test the general formulas for hydrocarbons:\n        *   **Alkanes (CnH2n+2):** %H = (2n+2) / (12n + 2n+2) = (2n+2) / (14n+2). As n increases, this value approaches 2/14 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%. For n=6 (hexane, C6H14), %H = 14 / (14*6+2) = 14/86 ≈ 16.3%. This is not a match.\n        *   **Cycloalkanes (CnH2n):** %H = 2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 2/14 = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857. This is a perfect match.\n    *   So, Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states Z is widely used as a solvent. Common cycloalkane solvents are cyclopentane (C5H10) and cyclohexane (C6H12). We'll see which one fits the other clues.\n    *   Z does not react further with hydrogen, which is consistent with it being a saturated cycloalkane.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n    *   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated (alkanes, cycloalkanes) or aromatic.\n    *   One constituent of Y is the substance Z. So, one liquid in Y is Z (a cycloalkane).\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives *only* substance Z. This means the second component of Y, let's call it Y₂, must also convert to Z upon hydrogenation.\n    *   If Y₂ hydrogenates to a cycloalkane Z, it must have the same carbon skeleton as Z and be either unsaturated or aromatic. Since Y₂ does not decolorize bromine water, it must be aromatic.\n    *   For an aromatic compound (Y₂) and a cycloalkane (Z) to have the same carbon skeleton that can be interconverted by hydrogenation, the skeleton must be a six-membered ring. This forces Z to be **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and Y₂ to be **benzene (C6H6)**.\n    *   Let's check this: Cyclohexane is a common solvent. Hydrogenation of benzene gives cyclohexane. Benzene does not react with bromine water without a catalyst. This all fits.\n    *   Therefore, mixture Y consists of equimolar amounts of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Disproportionation Reaction**\n\n    *   The reaction is `Mixture X → Mixture Y` upon heating with Pt.\n    *   This means: `(Components of X) --(Pt, heat)--> Benzene (C6H6) + Cyclohexane (C6H12)` (in a 1:1 molar ratio).\n    *   This is a disproportionation reaction, which in this context means a hydrogen transfer reaction. One species is dehydrogenated (loses hydrogen, gets \"oxidized\") and another is hydrogenated (gains hydrogen, gets \"reduced\").\n    *   Benzene (C6H6) is the oxidized product (less H than the starting materials).\n    *   Cyclohexane (C6H12) is the reduced product (more H than the starting materials).\n    *   Since mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (let's call them X₁ and X₂), and the products are also formed in an equimolar ratio, the simplest reaction stoichiometry is: `X₁ + X₂ → Benzene + Cyclohexane`.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This implies that both X₁ and X₂ have a six-carbon skeleton that hydrogenates to cyclohexane's skeleton. So, they must be of the formula C6Hy.\n    *   Our reaction becomes: `C6Hx + C6Hy → C6H6 + C6H12`.\n    *   By conservation of atoms, we can balance the hydrogens: `x + y = 6 + 12 = 18`.\n\n4.  **Identify the Components of Mixture X**\n\n    *   We need to find two compounds, X₁ (C6Hx) and X₂ (C6Hy), such that `x + y = 18`.\n    *   Properties of X₁ and X₂:\n        *   They are based on a 6-membered ring skeleton.\n        *   They decolorize bromine water, so they must contain C=C double bonds (i.e., they are cycloalkenes or cycloalkadienes).\n        *   They do not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   Let's look for possible candidates:\n        *   **Cyclohexene (C6H10):** Contains one double bond, so it decolorizes bromine water. The double bond is not conjugated. This is a possible candidate. Here, the number of hydrogens is 10.\n        *   **Cyclohexadienes (C6H8):** Contain two double bonds.\n            *   1,3-Cyclohexadiene: The double bonds are conjugated. The problem states there are no conjugated bonds, so this is ruled out.\n            *   **1,4-Cyclohexadiene:** The double bonds are not conjugated. This is a possible candidate. Here, the number of hydrogens is 8.\n    *   Let's test the combination of X₁ = Cyclohexene (C6H10) and X₂ = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   The number of hydrogen atoms are x=10 and y=8. Let's check our hydrogen balance: `x + y = 10 + 8 = 18`. This is a perfect match.\n    *   The disproportionation reaction would be:\n        `C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) + C6H10 (cyclohexene) --(Pt, heat)--> C6H6 (benzene) + C6H12 (cyclohexane)`\n        In this reaction, the 1,4-cyclohexadiene is oxidized (loses 2H) to benzene, and the cyclohexene is reduced (gains 2H) to cyclohexane. This is a chemically sound hydrogen transfer reaction.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer**\n\n    *   The two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in C6H10) + (H atoms in C6H8)\n    *   Total H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon, and the mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula: `(mass of H) / (total mass of molecule)`.\n*   Let's consider the general formula for saturated hydrocarbons.\n    *   For an alkane, CnH2n+2: Mass % H = `(2n + 2) * 1 / (12n + 2n + 2)` = `(2n + 2) / (14n + 2)`. Setting this to 0.1428 (or 1/7) does not yield an integer solution for n.\n    *   For a cycloalkane, CnH2n: Mass % H = `(2n) * 1 / (12n + 2n)` = `2n / 14n` = `2/14` = `1/7`.\n*   1/7 is approximately 0.142857, which matches the given 14.28%. Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane with the general formula CnH2n.\n*   The problem states that Z is widely used as a solvent. Common cycloalkane solvents are cyclopentane (C5H10) and cyclohexane (C6H12).\n*   The entire reaction chemistry described points towards a six-carbon ring system (as will be shown below), making **cyclohexane (C6H12)** the most logical identity for Z.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the components of mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, C and D.\n*   Y does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic. Benzene (aromatic) and saturated cycloalkanes do not react with bromine water under these conditions.\n*   Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n*   Z (cyclohexane) is itself a constituent of mixture Y. Let's say **D = Z = cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n*   The other component, C, must also be hydrogenated to Z (cyclohexane).\n*   The reaction that forms Y from X is a disproportionation over heated platinum. For a C6-ring system, this type of reaction typically involves dehydrogenation to form the stable aromatic compound, benzene, and hydrogenation of other molecules.\n*   Let's propose that the other component C is **benzene (C6H6)**.\n*   Let's check if Y = {benzene, cyclohexane} fits the criteria:\n    *   **Equimolar mixture of two liquids:** Benzene and cyclohexane are liquids and can form an equimolar mixture. Correct.\n    *   **Does not decolorize bromine water:** Correct.\n    *   **Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z:** Hydrogenation of benzene gives cyclohexane. Hydrogenation of cyclohexane gives cyclohexane. So, the mixture hydrogenates to give only cyclohexane (Z). Correct.\n    *   **Z is a constituent of Y:** Correct, cyclohexane is in the mixture.\n*   So, we conclude that **Y is an equimolar mixture of benzene (C6H6) and cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the components of mixture X**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B.\n*   X decolorizes bromine water, so A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds).\n*   The reaction X → Y is a disproportionation that produces an equimolar mixture of benzene and cyclohexane.\n    `A + B → C6H6 + C6H12`\n    (starting with 1 mole of A and 1 mole of B gives 1 mole of benzene and 1 mole of cyclohexane).\n*   By conservation of atoms, the total formula of A + B must be `C12H18`.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means both A and B must have a six-carbon skeleton that can be hydrogenated to a cyclohexane ring. Therefore, A and B are C6 compounds.\n*   Since A and B are C6 compounds and their combined formula is C12H18, they must have formulas C6Hx and C6Hy, where `x + y = 18`.\n*   A and B are unsaturated C6-ring compounds (isomers of cyclohexene or cyclohexadiene).\n    *   Cyclohexane (saturated) is C6H12.\n    *   Cyclohexene (one C=C bond) is C6H10.\n    *   Cyclohexadiene (two C=C bonds) is C6H8.\n*   We need to find two of these formulas whose hydrogen counts sum to 18. The only possible combination is 10 and 8.\n    *   Thus, one component of X is **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and the other is **cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n*   This combination makes sense in the disproportionation reaction:\n    `C6H8 (cyclohexadiene) → C6H6 (benzene) + 2H` (oxidation)\n    `C6H10 (cyclohexene) + 2H → C6H12 (cyclohexane)` (reduction)\n    This is a balanced hydrogen transfer between the two components of mixture X.\n*   Finally, the problem states that there are **no conjugated multiple bonds** in the compounds of mixture X.\n    *   Cyclohexene has only one double bond, so no conjugation.\n    *   For cyclohexadiene (C6H8), there are two isomers: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated).\n    *   Therefore, the specific diene must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene**.\n*   So, **X is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total number of hydrogen atoms**\n\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each liquid.\n*   Liquid 1: Cyclohexene (C6H10) has **10 hydrogen atoms**.\n*   Liquid 2: 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) has **8 hydrogen atoms**.\n*   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = **18**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 49:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z:**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   Let the formula be CxHy. The mass fraction of hydrogen is approximately `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   `y / (12x + y) = 0.1428`.\n    *   14.28% is very close to 1/7. `1/7 ≈ 0.142857`.\n    *   So, `y / (12x + y) = 1/7` => `7y = 12x + y` => `6y = 12x` => `y = 2x`.\n    *   The empirical formula of Z is CH2. The general formula is CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (it does not react further with hydrogen). The formula CnH2n corresponds to either an alkene or a cycloalkane. Since it's saturated, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Z is also described as a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane (C6H12). This fits the formula CnH2n with n=6. Let's assume Z is cyclohexane.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Hydrogenation Reaction:**\n    *   The problem states that hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y under severe conditions gives *only one substance*, which is Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   This is a crucial clue. It means that all the component molecules in both mixture X and mixture Y have the same carbon skeleton, which is a six-membered ring. If they had different skeletons (e.g., a five-membered ring with a methyl group), hydrogenation would likely produce different products or a mixture.\n\n3.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n    *   It does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated (or aromatic, which are resistant to this reaction).\n    *   Mixture Y is formed by the disproportionation of mixture X over heated platinum.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y gives only cyclohexane (Z).\n    *   Z (cyclohexane, C6H12) is a constituent of mixture Y.\n    *   Let the components of Y be Y1 and Y2. We know Y1 = Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    *   What is Y2? It must be a C6 compound that can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane. It must not decolorize bromine water. A well-known reaction that fits the description of \"disproportionation over platinum\" is the dehydrogenation/hydrogenation of cycloalkenes. A common example is the disproportionation of cyclohexene to cyclohexane and benzene.\n        `3 C6H10 (cyclohexene) --(Pt)--> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + 2 C6H6 (benzene)`\n    *   This suggests that the products in Y could be cyclohexane and benzene. Let's check if this fits the criteria for Y2 = Benzene (C6H6).\n        *   Hydrogenation: Benzene + 3H2 -> Cyclohexane. This works.\n        *   Decolorizes bromine water: Benzene does *not* decolorize aqueous bromine water under normal conditions, unlike alkenes. This fits.\n    *   So, we can confidently identify mixture Y as an equimolar mixture of **Cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **Benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n4.  **Identify the Components of Mixture X:**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2.\n    *   X is converted to Y via a catalytic process (heated Pt). This process is a disproportionation, which in this context means a hydrogen transfer reaction. The total number of carbon and hydrogen atoms is conserved between the reactants (X1 + X2) and the products (Y1 + Y2).\n    *   X1 + X2 → Y1 + Y2\n        `(C6H_a) + (C6H_b) → (C6H12) + (C6H6)`\n    *   Balancing the hydrogen atoms: `a + b = 12 + 6 = 18`.\n    *   So, the sum of the hydrogen atoms in one molecule of X1 and one molecule of X2 must be 18.\n    *   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, meaning both X1 and X2 are unsaturated (they contain C=C double bonds).\n    *   The molecules in X have no conjugated multiple bonds. All compounds are based on a six-membered ring.\n    *   Let's find C6 ring compounds that fit these descriptions:\n        *   **Cyclohexene (C6H10)**: One double bond (not conjugated). Has 10 hydrogen atoms. It will decolorize bromine water.\n        *   **1,3-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**: Has conjugated double bonds, so this is ruled out.\n        *   **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**: Has two non-conjugated (isolated) double bonds. Has 8 hydrogen atoms. It will decolorize bromine water.\n    *   Let's see if X1 = Cyclohexene (C6H10) and X2 = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) works.\n        *   Sum of hydrogen atoms: 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our requirement.\n        *   Both are C6 ring compounds.\n        *   Both decolorize bromine water.\n        *   Neither has conjugated bonds.\n        *   Hydrogenation of X = {C6H10, C6H8} gives only cyclohexane.

An equimolar mixture of reactants produces an equimolar mixture of products. This entire scenario is chemically sound and fits all given conditions.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   This means the sum of the number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of the first liquid (Cyclohexene, C6H10) and one molecule of the second liquid (1,4-Cyclohexadiene, C6H8).\n    *   Total Hydrogen Atoms = (H atoms in C6H10) + (H atoms in C6H8)\n    *   Total Hydrogen Atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the molecular formula of hydrocarbon Z.**\nThe problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CnHm.\nThe mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula:\nMass Fraction (H) = (m × Ar(H)) / (n × Ar(C) + m × Ar(H))\nUsing approximate atomic masses, Ar(H) ≈ 1 and Ar(C) ≈ 12.\n0.1428 = m / (12n + m)\nLet's rearrange the formula to find the ratio m/n:\nm = 0.1428 × (12n + m)\nm = 1.7136n + 0.1428m\nm - 0.1428m = 1.7136n\n0.8572m = 1.7136n\nm/n = 1.7136 / 0.8572 ≈ 2.0\n\nThis means the empirical formula for Z is CH2. The general formula is (CH2)n or CnH2n.\nThe problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a saturated hydrocarbon. A hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n that is saturated must be a cycloalkane. Acyclic alkanes have the formula CnH2n+2.\nSo, Z is a cycloalkane.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Z and the components of mixture Y.**\nZ is a cycloalkane (CnH2n) and is widely used as a solvent. Common cycloalkane solvents are cyclopentane (C5H10) and cyclohexane (C6H12). Both fit the formula CnH2n. The C6 ring system is very common in these types of reactions. Let's hypothesize that Z is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\nMixture Y is formed by the disproportionation of mixture X. Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, does not decolorize bromine water, and one of its components is Z (cyclohexane). Let mixture Y be {Z, D}.\nSince Y is a product of disproportionation, one component should be a \"reduced\" product and the other an \"oxidized\" product (in terms of hydrogen content).\n*   Z (cyclohexane, C6H12) is the reduced product.\n*   The other component, D, must be the oxidized (dehydrogenated) product. It must also have a C6 skeleton, as hydrogenation of Y gives only Z. It must not decolorize bromine water.\nThe most stable dehydrogenation product of a C6 cyclic system is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene is aromatically stable and does not react with bromine water.\nSo, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\nLet's check the hydrogenation condition for Y:\n*   Hydrogenation of cyclohexane (C6H12) yields cyclohexane (Z).\n*   Hydrogenation of benzene (C6H6) requires severe conditions (which is mentioned in the problem) and yields cyclohexane (Z): C6H6 + 3H2 → C6H12.\nThis confirms our identification of mixture Y = {cyclohexane, benzene} and Z = cyclohexane.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the components of mixture X.**\nMixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B. The reaction is:\nA + B → Y (equimolar mixture of C6H12 and C6H6)\nSo, the reaction is:\nA + B → C6H12 + C6H6\n\nWe are told that hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means:\n*   A + H2 → C6H12\n*   B + H2 → C6H12\nThis implies that both A and B are C6 hydrocarbons with a carbon skeleton that can be hydrogenated to that of cyclohexane.\nFrom the reaction stoichiometry A + B → C6H12 + C6H6, we can balance the atoms. Since A and B are both C6 hydrocarbons, let their formulas be C6Hx and C6Hy.\nC6Hx + C6Hy → C6H12 + C6H6\nBalancing hydrogen atoms: x + y = 12 + 6 = 18.\n\nSo, mixture X consists of two C6 hydrocarbons, C6Hx and C6Hy, where x + y = 18.\nThe problem also gives two crucial constraints for mixture X:\n1.  It decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds). This implies x < 12 and y < 12 (since C6H12 is the saturated cycloalkane).\n2.  There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules.\n\nWe need to find two even integers x and y such that x + y = 18 and x, y < 12. The only reasonable pair is x = 10 and y = 8.\nSo, the components of mixture X are A = C6H10 and B = C6H8.\n\nLet's find plausible structures:\n*   **A = C6H10**: A cycloalkene with a C6 ring. The simplest choice is **cyclohexene**. It has one double bond (decolorizes Br2 water) and no conjugated bonds. Hydrogenation gives cyclohexane. This fits perfectly.\n*   **B = C6H8**: A cycloalkadiene with a C6 ring. We need a non-conjugated isomer. Cyclohexa-1,3-diene is conjugated, so it is ruled out. **Cyclohexa-1,4-diene** has two isolated double bonds, so it is not conjugated. It decolorizes Br2 water and its hydrogenation gives cyclohexane. This fits perfectly.\n\nThe reaction is a hydrogen transfer:\nC6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (cyclohexa-1,4-diene) --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)\nIn this disproportionation, the cyclohexa-1,4-diene gives up hydrogen (is oxidized) to become benzene, and the cyclohexene accepts that hydrogen (is reduced) to become cyclohexane. This process explains how an equimolar mixture of reactants produces an equimolar mixture of products. All conditions are satisfied.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final answer.**\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of liquid A and one molecule of liquid B.\n*   Liquid A has the formula C6H10, so it has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n*   Liquid B has the formula C6H8, so it has 8 hydrogen atoms.\nTotal number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze and Identify Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon, a product of hydrogenation of other hydrocarbons (from mixtures X and Y).\n    *   Z does not react further with hydrogen, which means it is a saturated hydrocarbon (an alkane or a cycloalkane).\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is given as 14.28%.\n    *   Let's analyze this percentage. 14.28% is numerically very close to 1/7 (1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857).\n    *   Let's determine the general formula of a hydrocarbon where the mass ratio of C to H is 6:1 (since the H mass fraction is 1/7, the C mass fraction must be 6/7). Using integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1), the ratio of the number of atoms (H/C) is:\n        (Number of H atoms × 1) / (Number of C atoms × 12) = 1/6\n        Number of H atoms = 2 × Number of C atoms\n        So, the empirical formula of Z is CH2, and its general molecular formula is CnH2n.\n    *   A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane. An acyclic alkane has the formula CnH(2n+2).\n    *   So, Z is a cycloalkane.\n    *   We are told Z is widely used as a solvent. Common cycloalkane solvents include cyclopentane (C5H10) and cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    *   All components of mixtures X and Y have the same carbon skeleton, as they all yield only Z upon hydrogenation.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y and the Reaction X → Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This means the components of Y are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Z is a constituent of mixture Y. So, one component of Y is the cycloalkane Z.\n    *   The reaction from X to Y is a disproportionation catalyzed by platinum upon heating. A classic reaction of this type involving cyclic hydrocarbons is the Zelinsky irreversible catalysis, where a partially unsaturated six-membered ring disproportionates into an aromatic ring (oxidation) and a saturated ring (reduction).\n    *   This strongly suggests that the carbon skeleton is a six-membered ring. Therefore, Z is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n    *   Now let's identify the components of Y. One component is Z, so Y1 = cyclohexane (C6H12). Cyclohexane is saturated and does not decolorize bromine water.\n    *   The other component, Y2, must also have a C6 skeleton (since its hydrogenation gives Z) and must not decolorize bromine water. The product of oxidation of a C6-ring precursor in this type of reaction is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene does not react with bromine water under these conditions.\n    *   So, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **benzene (C6H6)** and **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n    *   Let's verify this. Hydrogenation of Y ({benzene, cyclohexane}) gives only cyclohexane (C6H6 + 3H2 → C6H12; C6H12 + H2 → no reaction). This fits the description.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2.\n    *   It decolorizes bromine water, meaning X1 and X2 are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n    *   They do not contain conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   The reaction to form Y is a disproportionation: one component of X is oxidized to benzene, and the other is reduced to cyclohexane. Since X is an equimolar mixture and Y is an equimolar mixture, the reaction is likely a 1:1 hydrogen transfer between the two components of X.\n        X1 + X2 --(Pt, heat)--> Benzene + Cyclohexane\n    *   Both X1 and X2 must have a C6 skeleton that can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane.\n    *   Let's perform an atom balance for the reaction:\n        Reactants: X1(C6Hy) + X2(C6Hz)\n        Products: Benzene(C6H6) + Cyclohexane(C6H12)\n        The total number of hydrogen atoms must be conserved: y + z = 6 + 12 = 18.\n    *   X1 and X2 are unsaturated C6 cyclic hydrocarbons. The possibilities are:\n        *   Cyclohexene (one double bond): C6H10\n        *   Cyclohexadiene (two double bonds): C6H8\n    *   Let's see if this pair fits the hydrogen atom balance: 10 + 8 = 18. Yes, it does.\n    *   The reaction can be envisioned as the cyclohexadiene donating hydrogen and being oxidized to benzene, while the cyclohexene accepts hydrogen and is reduced to cyclohexane.\n        C6H8 (H-donor) + C6H10 (H-acceptor) → C6H6 (oxidized) + C6H12 (reduced)\n    *   The problem states that there are no conjugated multiple bonds. Cyclohexene (C6H10) has only one double bond, so this is fine. For cyclohexadiene (C6H8), there are two isomers: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated). The condition implies that the diene must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene**.\n    *   So, mixture X consists of **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Answer**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of the hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n    *   Number of hydrogen atoms in cyclohexene (C6H10) = 10.\n    *   Number of hydrogen atoms in 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) = 8.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen (w(H)) of 14.28%.\n    *   Z does not react further with hydrogen, indicating it is a saturated hydrocarbon. The general formula for a saturated hydrocarbon is CnH(2n+2) (alkane) or CnH2n (cycloalkane).\n    *   Let's test the cycloalkane formula, CnH2n.\n        *   Atomic mass of C ≈ 12 g/mol\n        *   Atomic mass of H ≈ 1 g/mol\n        *   w(H) = (Mass of H) / (Total Mass) = (2n * 1) / (n * 12 + 2n * 1) = 2n / 14n = 1/7.\n    *   Let's calculate the value of 1/7.\n    ```python\n    print(1/7)\n    ```\n    *   The result is approximately 0.142857, which matches the given 14.28%.\n    *   Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n.\n    *   We are also told Z is widely used as a solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvents are cyclopentane (C5H10) and cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    *   The problem states that hydrogenation of mixture X and mixture Y gives *only* Z. This implies that all compounds in these mixtures have the same number of carbon atoms. We can infer that n=6 is the most likely case, given the reactions described (especially disproportionation leading to aromatic rings). So, let's hypothesize that **Z is cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids formed from X.\n    *   Y does *not* decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated (or aromatic, which also doesn't react with bromine water).\n    *   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of mixture Y. So, one liquid is cyclohexane (C6H12). Let's call it Y1.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n        *   Hydrogenation of Y1 (cyclohexane) gives cyclohexane (no reaction).\n        *   Hydrogenation of the other component, Y2, must also yield cyclohexane.\n    *   This reaction (Y -> Z) is a result of a disproportionation reaction (X -> Y). A classic disproportionation of cyclic C6 hydrocarbons on a Pt catalyst involves hydrogen transfer to form a saturated cycloalkane and a stable aromatic compound.\n    *   Let's propose that the products are cyclohexane and benzene.\n        *   Y1 = Cyclohexane (C6H12)\n        *   Y2 = Benzene (C6H6)\n    *   Let's check if this fits the conditions for Y:\n        *   Mixture of two liquids: Yes, at standard conditions, both are liquids.\n        *   Does not decolorize bromine water: Yes, saturated alkanes and aromatic rings do not react with Br2 water.\n        *   Hydrogenation gives only Z:\n            *   Cyclohexane + H2 -> Cyclohexane.\n            *   Benzene + 3H2 -> Cyclohexane.\n            *   This is correct. The hydrogenation of this mixture yields only cyclohexane.\n    *   The problem states that Y is an equimolar mixture. This means the disproportionation reaction that forms Y must produce cyclohexane and benzene in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n\n3.  **Identify the Components of Mixture X**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n    *   X *does* decolorize bromine water, so its components are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n    *   The molecules in X have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means both components of X must be C6 compounds whose carbon skeleton can be hydrogenated to a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The reaction X -> Y is an equimolar disproportionation. Based on our proposed Y, the reaction is:\n        (Mixture X) -> Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6) [in a 1:1 ratio]\n    *   Since X is an equimolar mixture of two components, X1 and X2, the reaction is likely:\n        **X1 + X2 -> C6H12 + C6H6**\n    *   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component is hydrogenated, the other is dehydrogenated. Let's check the atom balance.\n        *   Right side: C = 6+6 = 12; H = 12+6 = 18.\n        *   Left side must also have 12 carbons and 18 hydrogens in total from one molecule of X1 and one molecule of X2.\n    *   Let's find plausible structures for X1 and X2:\n        *   They must be C6 cyclic compounds that hydrogenate to cyclohexane.\n        *   They must be unsaturated.\n        *   They must not have conjugated bonds.\n        *   Their total H-atom count must be 18.\n    *   Let's consider unsaturated derivatives of cyclohexane:\n        *   **Cyclohexene (C6H10)**: One C=C bond. No conjugation. Hydrogenates to cyclohexane.\n        *   **1,3-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**: Two C=C bonds. They are conjugated. This is ruled out by the problem statement.\n        *   **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**: Two C=C bonds. They are isolated (not conjugated). This is a valid candidate. It hydrogenates to cyclohexane.\n    *   Let's propose X1 = Cyclohexene (C6H10) and X2 = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n        *   Are they liquids? Yes.\n        *   Are they equimolar in mixture X? Yes.\n        *   Do they decolorize bromine water? Yes.\n        *   No conjugated bonds? Correct.\n    *   Let's check the H-atom count for the reaction:\n        *   H atoms in X1 (C6H10) = 10.\n        *   H atoms in X2 (C6H8) = 8.\n        *   Total H atoms on the left = 10 + 8 = 18.\n        *   Total H atoms on the right = 12 (from C6H12) + 6 (from C6H6) = 18.\n    *   The proposed reaction, Cyclohexene + 1,4-Cyclohexadiene -> Cyclohexane + Benzene, is balanced and chemically plausible as a disproportionation on a platinum catalyst. This model fits all the conditions given in the problem.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Answer**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of X1 and one molecule of X2.\n    *   Liquid 1 (X1) is cyclohexene, C6**H10**. It has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Liquid 2 (X2) is 1,4-cyclohexadiene, C6**H8**. It has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\nHere's my thinking process to solve this chemistry problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem Statement:** I'll break down the given information into key facts about the mixtures (X, Y) and the final product (Z).\n\n    *   **Mixture X:**\n        *   Contains two liquids, A and B.\n        *   They are in an equimolar ratio (1:1).\n        *   Decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and B contain carbon-carbon double or triple bonds (they are unsaturated).\n        *   Their molecules have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n\n    *   **The Reaction:**\n        *   Mixture X (A+B) is heated with a Platinum (Pt) catalyst.\n        *   It forms mixture Y (C+D).\n        *   Mixture Y is also equimolar.\n        *   The reaction is described as a \"disproportionation.\"\n\n    *   **Mixture Y:**\n        *   Contains two liquids, C and D.\n        *   Equimolar ratio.\n        *   Does *not* decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are likely saturated (alkanes, cycloalkanes) or aromatic.\n\n    *   **Substance Z:**\n        *   Produced by the hydrogenation of *both* mixture X (A+B) and mixture Y (C+D). This is a crucial clue: it means A, B, C, and D all share the same carbon skeleton.\n        *   Hydrogenation produces *only* Z.\n        *   Z is a hydrocarbon.\n        *   Z has a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n        *   Z is a component of mixture Y (so either C or D is Z).\n        *   Z is a common solvent.\n        *   Z is fully saturated (does not react further with hydrogen).\n\n2.  **Identify Substance Z:** This is the best starting point.\n\n    *   Z is a saturated hydrocarbon. Its general formula can be CnH2n+2 (alkane) or CnH2n (cycloalkane).\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given as 14.28%. This value is very close to the fraction 1/7 (1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857).\n    *   Let's check which hydrocarbon formula gives a hydrogen mass fraction of 1/7, using integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1) as is common in such problems.\n        *   For an alkane, CnH2n+2: %H = (2n+2) / (12n + 2n+2) = (2n+2) / (14n+2).\n        *   For a cycloalkane, CnH2n: %H = (2n) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7.\n    *   This is a perfect match. So, Z is a cycloalkane with the formula **CnH2n**.\n\n3.  **Use the Hydrogenation Clue:**\n\n    *   Hydrogenation of A, B, C, and D all produce Z. This means they must all have the same number of carbon atoms ('n') and the same ring structure as Z.\n    *   The fact that Z is a \"widely used solvent\" points towards common cycloalkanes like cyclopentane (C5H10) or, more likely, **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. Let's assume Z is cyclohexane. The formula C6H12 fits the CnH2n pattern and the %H calculation (12 / (6*12 + 12) = 12/84 = 1/7).\n\n4.  **Identify Mixture Y (C and D):**\n\n    *   Y is an equimolar mixture of C and D.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water.\n    *   Z (cyclohexane) is a component of Y. Let's say **D = Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n    *   So, mixture Y is (C + Cyclohexane).\n    *   The other component, C, must also not decolorize bromine water and must have a C6 skeleton. Upon severe hydrogenation, C must form cyclohexane. A perfect candidate for C is **Benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene does not decolorize bromine water (without a specific catalyst) and hydrogenates under severe conditions to form cyclohexane.\n    *   So, Mixture Y is an equimolar mix of **Benzene (C6H6)** and **Cyclohexane (C6H12)**. This fits all the criteria for Y.\n\n5.  **Identify Mixture X (A and B):**\n\n    *   The reaction is `Mixture X (A+B) → Mixture Y (Benzene + Cyclohexane)`.\n    *   Since X and Y are both equimolar, the stoichiometry of the reaction must be `1A + 1B → 1C + 1D`.\n    *   Substituting the formulas we found: `C6H(a) + C6H(b) → C6H6 + C6H12`. (We use C6 because the carbon skeleton is conserved).\n    *   By the law of conservation of mass (and atoms), we can balance the hydrogen atoms: `a + b = 6 + 12 = 18`.\n    *   So, the two liquids in mixture X, A and B, are C6 hydrocarbons, and the total number of hydrogen atoms in their molecules is 18.\n    *   Now let's check the remaining clues for X:\n        *   They decolorize bromine water, so they are unsaturated (contain C=C bonds).\n        *   They have a C6 ring structure (to hydrogenate to cyclohexane).\n        *   They do not have conjugated double bonds.\n    *   Let's find plausible C6 unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbons.\n        *   **Cyclohexene** has the formula **C6H10**.

Let's use atomic masses C ≈ 12 g/mol and H ≈ 1 g/mol.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as `(mass of H) / (total mass) = (y * 1) / (x * 12 + y * 1)`.\n*   Setting this equal to 14.28%, or 0.1428:\n    `y / (12x + y) = 0.1428`\n    A more precise way is to recognize that 14.28% is very close to 1/7 (1 / 7 ≈ 0.142857).\n    `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`\n    `7y = 12x + y`\n    `6y = 12x`\n    `y = 2x`\n*   This means the empirical formula of Z is CH2, and the general formula is CnH2n.\n*   We are told Z is a hydrocarbon that does not react further with hydrogen. This means it is saturated.\n*   A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n*   The problem also states that Z is \"widely used as a solvent\". Among cycloalkanes, **cyclohexane (C6H12)** is a very common solvent. This fits the formula CnH2n (for n=6).\n*   Therefore, it is highly probable that **Z is cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n*   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of mixture Y. So, one liquid in Y is cyclohexane (C6H12).\n*   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water, which means both its components are saturated (no C=C or C≡C bonds).\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   Hydrogenating cyclohexane (C6H12) will just yield cyclohexane.\n    *   The other component of Y, let's call it Y2, must also yield cyclohexane upon hydrogenation. And Y2 is saturated.\n*   The reaction that forms Y is a disproportionation. A classic disproportionation of C6 cyclic compounds involves forming a fully saturated species (cyclohexane) and a fully unsaturated one (benzene).\n    `Reactant(s) --(Pt, heat)--> Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)`\n*   Let's hypothesize that **mixture Y consists of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6)**.\n*   Let's check if this fits the criteria for Y:\n    *   Equimolar mixture of two liquids: Benzene and cyclohexane are both liquids at room temperature. The reaction stoichiometry needs to be checked, but this is a plausible composition.\n    *   Does not decolorize bromine water: Neither benzene (under these conditions) nor cyclohexane reacts with bromine water. This fits.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z:\n        *   Cyclohexane + H2 → Cyclohexane (Z).\n        *   Benzene + 3H2 --(severe conditions)--> Cyclohexane (Z). This reaction requires severe conditions (high pressure/temperature), which matches the problem description. This fits.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Components of Mixture X**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that, upon disproportionation, forms mixture Y (cyclohexane + benzene).\n*   This means the overall reaction is: `X1 + X2 --(Pt, heat)--> C6H6 + C6H12`\n*   Since the products are equimolar (1 mole of benzene and 1 mole of cyclohexane), the reactants X1 and X2 must also be equimolar (1 mole of X1 and 1 mole of X2).\n*   This reaction is a hydrogen transfer: one reactant loses hydrogen (is oxidized) and the other gains hydrogen (is reduced).\n*   The total number of atoms must be conserved. The products have (6+6)=12 Carbon atoms and (6+12)=18 Hydrogen atoms. Therefore, the reactants X1+X2 must also have a total of 12 Carbon and 18 Hydrogen atoms. Since all species are C6 based (as they all hydrogenate to cyclohexane), X1 and X2 must be C6 hydrocarbons. So, X1 is C6Ha and X2 is C6Hb, where a+b=18.\n*   X1 and X2 decolorize bromine water, so they are unsaturated (contain C=C bonds).\n*   A key constraint is that there are **no conjugated multiple bonds** in the compounds of mixture X.\n*   Let's propose reactants that would logically lead to the products.\n    *   The formation of benzene (C6H6) requires an H-donor. A likely candidate is a cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   The formation of cyclohexane (C6H12) requires an H-acceptor. A likely candidate is cyclohexene (C6H10).\n*   Let's test this pair: X1 = **Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)** and X2 = **Cyclohexene (C6H10)**.\n    *   The hydrogen atoms sum to 8 + 10 = 18. This matches the products.\n    *   The reaction would be: `C6H8 + C6H10 --(Pt, heat)--> C6H6 + C6H12`. This is a balanced hydrogen transfer reaction. Cyclohexadiene loses 2H to become benzene, and cyclohexene gains 2H to become cyclohexane.\n*   Let's check the constraints for X:\n    *   Decolorize bromine water: Both have double bonds. Yes.\n    *   No conjugated bonds: There are two isomers of cyclohexadiene: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated). The problem specifies no conjugated bonds, so X1 must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene**. Cyclohexene has only one double bond, so it is not conjugated. This fits perfectly.\n    *   Hydrogenation of X gives only Z:\n        *   1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) + 2H2 → Cyclohexane (C6H12). Yes.\n        *   Cyclohexene (C6H10) + H2 → Cyclohexane (C6H12). Yes.\n\nAll conditions are met with this scheme.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\nThe two liquids in mixture X are:\n1.  1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8), which has **8** hydrogen atoms.\n2.  Cyclohexene (C6H10), which has **10** hydrogen atoms.\n\nTotal number of hydrogen atoms = 8 + 10 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 55:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given as 14.28%.\n    *   Let's determine the empirical formula of Z. The mass fraction of hydrogen in a hydrocarbon CₙHₘ is given by `(m * M_H) / (n * M_C + m * M_H)`, where M_H and M_C are the atomic masses of hydrogen and carbon, respectively.\n    *   Using approximate integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1), the fraction is `m / (12n + m)`.\n    *   The given percentage 14.28% is very close to 1/7 (since 1/7 ≈ 0.142857). Let's check if the formula for a cycloalkane, CₙH₂ₙ, fits this. The mass fraction of hydrogen in CₙH₂ₙ is `2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 2/14 = 1/7`.\n    *   This is a perfect match. So, the general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen. This confirms it is a saturated compound, so it cannot be an alkene. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y**\n    *   Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n    *   One of the constituents of Y is substance Z (a cycloalkane, CₙH₂ₙ).\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water, which means its components are saturated or aromatic. Z is saturated.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z. Let the other component of Y be D. So, hydrogenating the mixture {Z, D} gives only Z. Since Z is already saturated, this implies that hydrogenating D must yield Z.\n    *   For D to be hydrogenated to Z (a cycloalkane), and also not decolorize bromine water on its own, it must be an aromatic compound with the same carbon skeleton as Z. The general formula for such an arene with a single aromatic ring derived from a Cₙ cycloalkane would be CₙH₂ₙ₋₆ (by loss of 3 H₂ molecules). For instance, benzene (C₆H₆) hydrogenates to cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). Toluene (C₇H₈) hydrogenates to methylcyclohexane (C₇H₁₄).\n    *   So, mixture Y consists of an equimolar mixture of a cycloalkane (Z) and its corresponding aromatic analog (D): Y = {CₙH₂ₙ, CₙH₂ₙ₋₆}.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction from X to Y**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n    *   The reaction `X → Y` is described as a disproportionation. This reaction happens on a platinum catalyst with heating. This is characteristic of hydrogen transfer reactions among unsaturated cyclic compounds.\n    *   The reaction forms an equimolar mixture Y. Since X is also equimolar, the stoichiometry of the reaction is 1A + 1B → 1Z + 1D.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z. This means both A and B must have the same carbon skeleton as Z. So, A and B are unsaturated hydrocarbons with the formula CₙHₐ and CₙHᵦ, respectively.\n\n4.  **Determine the Number of Hydrogen Atoms**\n    *   Let's write the balanced chemical equation for the disproportionation:\n        `CₙHₐ (A) + CₙHᵦ (B) → CₙH₂ₙ (Z) + CₙH₂ₙ₋₆ (D)`\n        (Note: For the case of Toluene D=C₇H₈ and Z=C₇H₁₄, the formula for D is CₙH₂ₙ₋₆ as well, since 2n-6 = 2*7-6=8).\n    *   By the law of conservation of mass, the number of hydrogen atoms on both sides of the equation must be equal.\n        `a + b = 2n + (2n - 6) = 4n - 6` (This general formula seems complex, let's stick to concrete examples).\n\n5.  **Identify the Specific Compounds (or Carbon Skeleton)**\n    *   Z is described as being \"widely used as a solvent\". Both cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and methylcyclohexane (C₇H₁₄) are common solvents and fit the CₙH₂ₙ formula and the H mass fraction.\n    *   **Case 1: The C₆ system.** Let's assume Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). This is the most classic example for this type of reaction.\n        *   Z = Cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂.\n        *   D = Benzene, C₆H₆.\n        *   Mixture Y = {Cyclohexane, Benzene}.\n        *   The reaction is: `A(C₆Hₐ) + B(C₆Hᵦ) → Cyclohexane(C₆H₁₂) + Benzene(C₆H₆)`.\n        *   Balancing the hydrogen atoms: `a + b = 12 + 6 = 18`.\n        *   This scenario is chemically sound. For instance, A and B could be cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈). `10 + 8 = 18`. Both are unsaturated, non-conjugated, and would hydrogenate to cyclohexane.\n\n    *   **Case 2: The C₇ system.** Let's assume Z is methylcyclohexane (C₇H₁₄).\n        *   Z = Methylcyclohexane, C₇H₁₄.\n        *   D = Toluene, C₇H₈.\n        *   Mixture Y = {Methylcyclohexane, Toluene}.\n        *   The reaction is: `A(C₇Hₐ) + B(C₇Hᵦ) → Methylcyclohexane(C₇H₁₄) + Toluene(C₇H₈)`.\n        *   Balancing the hydrogen atoms: `a + b = 14 + 8 = 22`.\n\n6.  **Conclusion**\n    *   We have two plausible answers based on the carbon skeleton: 18 (for C₆) and 22 (for C₇). Both are listed as options (B and D).\n    *   The reaction described is a classic example of Zelinsky disproportionation chemistry, for which the cyclohexane/benzene system is the primary textbook example. In the absence of further information to distinguish the two cases, it is most probable that the question refers to this fundamental C₆ system.\n    *   The question asks for the \"total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X\". This corresponds to the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B, which is `a + b`.\n    *   Based on the C₆ model, this sum is 18.\n\nTherefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the chemistry problem.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon with the formula C_n H_m.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. Let's express this as a fraction: 14.28% ≈ 14.28/100 ≈ 1/7.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula: `Mass_fraction(H) = (m * M_H) / (n * M_C + m * M_H)`, where M_H and M_C are the atomic masses of hydrogen and carbon, respectively.\n*   Using approximate integer masses (C=12, H=1), which is common in such problems, we get: `1/7 = (m * 1) / (n * 12 + m * 1)`\n*   This simplifies to `12n + m = 7m`, which gives `12n = 6m`, or `m = 2n`.\n*   A hydrocarbon with the formula C_n H_{2n} can be either an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n*   The problem states that Z is formed by hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n*   The problem also states that Z is widely used as a solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent with a six-membered ring structure (which we will see is required later) is cyclohexane.\n*   Let's check for cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂. Here, n=6 and m=12, so m=2n. This fits our derived formula. Let's confirm the mass fraction with C=12 and H=1: `Mass_fraction(H) = 12 / (6*12 + 12) = 12 / (72 + 12) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%`.\n*   Thus, hydrocarbon Z is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Carbon Skeleton of the Compounds**\n\n*   The problem states that hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y gives *only one substance*, which is Z (cyclohexane).\n*   Hydrogenation is a reaction that adds hydrogen across double/triple bonds or opens certain rings, but it typically does not rearrange the carbon skeleton under these conditions.\n*   Since the only final product is cyclohexane (a C₆ ring), all the compounds in both mixture X and mixture Y must have a six-carbon ring skeleton.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is formed from mixture X by heating with platinum. It's an equimolar mixture of two liquids and does not decolorize bromine water.\n*   This indicates that the components of Y are saturated or aromatic.\n*   One of the components of Y is Z, which is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). Cyclohexane is saturated and does not decolorize bromine water.\n*   The reaction to form Y is described as a disproportionation. In catalytic reactions involving unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbons and platinum, this often means hydrogen transfer. An intermediate unsaturated compound is converted into a fully saturated one (reduction) and a fully unsaturated (aromatic) one (oxidation).\n*   Since cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) is the reduced product, the other component must be the oxidized product. The ultimate oxidation product of a C₆ ring is **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n*   Benzene does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions (it requires a Lewis acid catalyst).\n*   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **benzene (C₆H₆)** and **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n*   Let's check if hydrogenating mixture Y gives only Z.\n    *   Hydrogenation of benzene: C₆H₆ + 3H₂ → C₆H₁₂ (cyclohexane)\n    *   Hydrogenation of cyclohexane: No reaction.\n*   So, hydrogenation of mixture Y correctly yields only cyclohexane (Z).\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Components of Mixture X and Solve the Question**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them X₁ and X₂.\n*   X decolorizes bromine water, meaning X₁ and X₂ are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n*   Molecules in X have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   When mixture X is treated, it yields an equimolar mixture Y. This suggests a 1:1 stoichiometric reaction between the components of X to form the components of Y.\n    *   X₁ + X₂ → Y₁ + Y₂\n    *   X₁ + X₂ → Benzene (C₆H₆) + Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)\n*   Since all molecules have a C₆ skeleton, we only need to balance the hydrogen atoms. The total number of hydrogen atoms must be conserved.\n    *   Total H atoms on the left = Total H atoms on the right\n    *   H atoms in X₁ + H atoms in X₂ = H atoms in benzene + H atoms in cyclohexane\n    *   H atoms in X₁ + H atoms in X₂ = 6 + 12 = 18.\n*   We need to find two unsaturated, non-conjugated C₆-ring compounds whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18.\n*   The possible candidates are:\n    *   **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)**: It has one C=C bond and is not conjugated.\n    *   **Cyclohexadienes (C₆H₈)**: There are two isomers: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated). The problem rules out the conjugated one.\n*   So our candidates for X₁ and X₂ are **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n*   Let's check if their hydrogen atoms sum to 18:\n    *   10 (from cyclohexene) + 8 (from 1,4-cyclohexadiene) = 18.\n*   This fits perfectly. The reaction is a catalytic hydrogen transfer: 1,4-cyclohexadiene loses two hydrogens to become benzene, and cyclohexene gains those two hydrogens to become cyclohexane.\n    *   C₆H₈ (1,4-cyclohexadiene) + C₆H₁₀ (cyclohexene) → C₆H₆ (benzene) + C₆H₁₂ (cyclohexane)\n*   The question asks for \"the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X\". This means the sum of the hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n*   Total hydrogen atoms = (H in X₁) + (H in X₂) = 8 + 10 = 18.\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z:**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CxHy. The mass fraction of H is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   `y / (12x + y) = 0.1428`.\n    *   This is very close to 1/7 (which is approximately 0.142857). If the mass fraction is 1/7, then `7y = 12x + y`, which means `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n    *   A formula of CxH2x, or CnH2n, corresponds to an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z is the result of hydrogenating other substances and does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a saturated hydrocarbon.\n    *   Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Carbon Skeleton:**\n    *   Mixture X (containing liquids A and B) and mixture Y (containing liquids C and D) can both be hydrogenated to yield *only* substance Z.\n    *   This is a critical clue. It implies that all four compounds (A, B, C, D) share the exact same carbon skeleton as Z. The differences between them are only the number of hydrogen atoms (i.e., the degree of unsaturation).\n    *   Since Z is a cycloalkane, A, B, C, and D must all be based on the same cyclic carbon skeleton.\n\n3.  **Identify Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (C and D) that does not decolorize bromine water. This suggests they are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   We know one component of Y is Z itself. Let's say C = Z.\n    *   So, C = CnH2n (a cycloalkane), which is saturated.\n    *   The other component, D, must also not decolorize bromine water but must hydrogenate to Z. The most logical candidate for D is an aromatic compound with the same carbon skeleton.\n    *   Aromatization of a CnH2n cycloalkane ring typically involves the formation of a benzene ring structure. This process involves the loss of at least 6 hydrogen atoms. The general formula for a mono-alkyl substituted benzene is CnH2n-8 (e.g. Toluene C7H8) while Benzene itself is C6H6. A general formula that links an alkyl-cycloalkane CnH2n to its corresponding aromatic is CnH2n-6 (e.g., hydrogenating C6H6 (Benzene) gives C6H12 (Cyclohexane), and H count difference is 6; hydrogenating C7H8 (Toluene) gives C7H14 (Methylcyclohexane), and H count difference is 6).\n    *   So, we can deduce: Y = {C (CnH2n), D (CnH2n-6)}.\n\n4.  **Identify Mixture X and the Disproportionation Reaction:**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (A and B) that decolorize bromine water (so they are unsaturated) and have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   X is converted to Y via a disproportionation reaction upon heating with a platinum catalyst.\n    *   The overall reaction converts the equimolar mixture X into the equimolar mixture Y. The simplest and most direct interpretation is a 1:1 reaction: A + B → C + D.\n    *   In a disproportionation reaction involving hydrocarbons, hydrogen atoms are transferred from one molecule to another. One molecule is oxidized (loses H), and another is reduced (gains H).\n    *   Let's check the hydrogen atom balance:\n        H(A) + H(B) = H(C) + H(D)\n        H(A) + H(B) = (2n) + (2n - 6) = 4n - 6.\n    *   The components of X, A and B, must be unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbons with a C_n skeleton. The most common types are cycloalkenes (formula CnH2n-2) and cycloalkadienes (formula CnH2n-4).\n    *   Let's assume A is a cycloalkene (CnH2n-2) and B is a non-conjugated cycloalkadiene (CnH2n-4).\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms in one pair of molecules from X = (2n-2) + (2n-4) = 4n - 6.\n    *   This perfectly matches the hydrogen atom count for Y. This confirms our assignments for A and B.\n    *   The reaction is: CnH2n-2 (cycloalkene) + CnH2n-4 (diene) → CnH2n (cycloalkane) + CnH2n-6 (aromatic). This is a plausible intermolecular hydrogen transfer, where the diene donates hydrogen to the alkene.\n\n5.  **Determine the value of 'n':**\n    *   The problem can now be solved if we can find 'n'. The information given (\"widely used as a solvent\", etc.) is general enough to apply to several possibilities. Let's test small, common values for `n` (noting that n must be at least 6 to form a benzene ring).\n    *   **Case n=6:**\n        *   Z = C6H12 (Cyclohexane). %H = 12/84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.3%. It's a common solvent.\n        *   Y = {C6H12 (Cyclohexane), C6H6 (Benzene)}. An equimolar mixture. Both don't decolorize Br2 water.\n        *   X = {C6H10 (Cyclohexene), C6H8 (Cyclohexa-1,4-diene)}. Both are unsaturated liquids. Cyclohexa-1,4-diene is non-conjugated.\n        *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X would be 10 + 8 = 18. This matches option C. This entire scenario is chemically consistent.\n    *   **Case n=7:**\n        *   Z = C7H14 (Methylcyclohexane). %H = 14/98 = 1/7 ≈ 14.3%. Also used as a solvent.\n        *   Y = {C7H14 (Methylcyclohexane), C7H8 (Toluene)}.\n        *   X = {C7H12 (a Methylcyclohexene), C7H10 (a non-conjugated Methylcyclohexadiene)}.\n        *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in X would be 12 + 10 = 22. This matches option A. This scenario is also chemically consistent.\n\n6.  **Resolve the Ambiguity:**\n    *   Both the n=6 and n=7 cases are chemically plausible and match options in the multiple-choice list. However, such problems in chemistry contests are typically designed to have a single correct answer.\n    *   The n=6 system (cyclohexane/benzene) is the most fundamental and archetypal example of these types of disproportionation and hydrogenation reactions involving cyclic compounds. The C7 system is essentially the same chemistry but with an added methyl group. In the absence of information to the contrary, the simplest, parent system is the intended answer.\n    *   Therefore, we choose n=6.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   For n=6, the two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8).\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each liquid is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze and identify substance Z.**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with the general formula CnHm.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is given as 14.28%. Let's use the approximate atomic masses: Ar(H) ≈ 1 and Ar(C) ≈ 12.\n    *   The formula for the mass fraction of hydrogen is: `(m * Ar(H)) / (n * Ar(C) + m * Ar(H)) = 0.1428`.\n    *   Substituting the values: `m / (12n + m) ≈ 0.1428`.\n    *   The value 0.1428 is very close to 1/7. So, let's assume the mass fraction is exactly 1/7.\n    *   `m / (12n + m) = 1/7`\n    *   `7m = 12n + m`\n    *   `6m = 12n`\n    *   `m = 2n`.\n    *   So, the molecular formula of Z is `CnH2n`.\n    *   We are told Z is saturated (does not react further with hydrogen). A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula `CnH2n` must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y gives *only one* substance, Z. This means all compounds in X and Y have the same carbon skeleton.\n    *   We are also told that Z is a constituent of mixture Y, which is formed by a disproportionation reaction. Disproportionation of an unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbon (which must be in X) typically yields an aromatic compound and a saturated cycloalkane. This strongly suggests that the carbon skeleton is a 6-membered ring.\n    *   Therefore, the saturated cycloalkane Z is cyclohexane (`C6H12`), and the corresponding aromatic compound would be benzene (`C6H6`).\n    *   Let's verify our assumptions: Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12). It is widely used as a solvent. The mass percentage of hydrogen in C6H12 is `(12 * 1) / (6 * 12 + 12 * 1) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%`. This confirms our identification.\n\n2.  **Identify the components of mixture Y.**\n    *   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water, which is true for saturated and aromatic compounds.\n    *   Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n    *   Z (cyclohexane, C6H12) is one of the components.\n    *   Y is formed by the disproportionation of X. As reasoned above, this reaction would produce cyclohexane and benzene.\n    *   So, the other component of Y must be benzene (C6H6). Benzene does not decolorize bromine water under these conditions.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y (cyclohexane and benzene) would yield only cyclohexane, as stated in the problem (`C6H6 + 3H2 → C6H12`).\n    *   Therefore, mixture Y consists of equimolar amounts of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6).\n\n3.  **Identify the components of mixture X.**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n    *   They undergo disproportionation upon heating with platinum to form an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6). The reaction is: `A + B → C6H12 + C6H6`.\n    *   From the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms on both sides must be equal. If A is C6Hx and B is C6Hy, then the total number of hydrogen atoms is `x + y = 12 + 6 = 18`.\n    *   X decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds).\n    *   Hydrogenation of X gives only cyclohexane, so A and B must both have a six-membered carbon ring skeleton.\n    *   The problem states that there are no *conjugated* multiple bonds in the molecules of X.\n    *   Let's consider possible unsaturated C6 ring compounds:\n        *   Cyclohexene (C6H10): Has one double bond, not conjugated.\n        *   1,3-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8): Has two double bonds which are conjugated. This is ruled out.\n        *   1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8): Has two isolated (non-conjugated) double bonds.\n    *   The two components of mixture X must therefore be cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   Let's check if this is consistent.\n        *   A = C6H10 (cyclohexene)\n        *   B = C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene)\n        *   Total hydrogen atoms: `10 + 8 = 18`. This matches our atom balance.\n        *   Reaction: `C6H10 + C6H8 --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 + C6H6`. This is a plausible hydrogen transfer (disproportionation) reaction where the more unsaturated compound (diene) is dehydrogenated to benzene, and the less unsaturated one (monoene) is hydrogenated to cyclohexane.\n        *   Since mixture X is equimolar, the reaction produces an equimolar mixture Y. All conditions are satisfied.\n\n4.  **Calculate the final answer.**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of the first liquid and one molecule of the second liquid.\n    *   First liquid (cyclohexene): C6H10 has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Second liquid (1,4-cyclohexadiene): C6H8 has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 59:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Hydrocarbon Z.**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let's determine its general formula.\n    *   The mass percentage of hydrogen is calculated as `(mass of H) / (total mass) * 100%`. The atomic mass of Carbon (C) is ~12 g/mol and Hydrogen (H) is ~1 g/mol.\n    *   14.28% is numerically very close to the fraction 1/7 (since 1/7 ≈ 0.142857).\n    *   Let's test the general formula for alkanes, CnH(2n+2). Mass % H = `(2n+2) / (12n + 2n+2) = (2n+2) / (14n+2)`. Setting this to 1/7 gives `7(2n+2) = 14n+2`, which simplifies to `14n+14 = 14n+2`, an impossibility.\n    *   Let's test the general formula for cycloalkanes or alkenes, CnH2n. Mass % H = `(2n) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7`. This matches perfectly.\n    *   The problem states Z is a hydrocarbon that does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it is saturated. A hydrocarbon with the formula CnH2n that is saturated must be a **cycloalkane**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y.**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, C and D.\n    *   It does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are either saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Z is a constituent of Y. Let's say C = Z. So, C is a cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z. This means `Hydrogenation(C + D) -> Z`.\n    *   Since C is Z (a saturated cycloalkane), it does not hydrogenate. Therefore, the other component, D, must hydrogenate to Z: `Hydrogenation(D) -> Z`.\n    *   Since D does not decolorize bromine water but reacts with hydrogen under \"rather severe conditions\" to give a cycloalkane Z, D must be an **aromatic hydrocarbon** with the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n    *   The simplest and most common chemical system that fits this description is the **benzene/cyclohexane pair**. This corresponds to a 6-carbon atom skeleton (n=6).\n    *   So, Z = **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and D = **benzene (C6H6)**.\n    *   Let's verify these fit the description:\n        *   Z (cyclohexane) is a widely used solvent. Correct.\n        *   Y = {cyclohexane, benzene}. This is a mixture of two liquids. Both do not decolorize bromine water. Correct.\n    *   Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane and benzene.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Disproportionation Reaction.**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B.\n    *   A and B decolorize bromine water, so they are unsaturated (contain C=C bonds).\n    *   \"There are no conjugated multiple bonds\" is a condition on their structure.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means `Hydrogenation(A) -> Cyclohexane` and `Hydrogenation(B) -> Cyclohexane`. This confirms A and B are unsaturated hydrocarbons with a 6-carbon cyclic skeleton. They are isomers of cyclohexene or cyclohexadiene.\n    *   The reaction `X -> Y` is a disproportionation that happens on a platinum catalyst. An equimolar mixture of X {A, B} gives an equimolar mixture of Y {cyclohexane, benzene}.\n    *   This implies a 1:1 reaction stoichiometry: `A + B --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 + C6H6`.\n    *   This type of reaction is a catalytic hydrogen transfer. One molecule is the hydrogen donor (it gets dehydrogenated/oxidized to benzene), and the other is the hydrogen acceptor (it gets hydrogenated/reduced to cyclohexane).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms.**\n    *   The chemical reaction involves the atoms of the reactants A and B rearranging to form the products, cyclohexane and benzene. The total number of atoms of each element must be conserved.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (one molecule of A and one molecule of B) must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products (one molecule of cyclohexane and one molecule of benzene).\n    *   Number of H atoms in cyclohexane (C6H12) = 12.\n    *   Number of H atoms in benzene (C6H6) = 6.\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   This sum represents the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n\n5.  **Final Check.**\n    *   The total number of hydrogens is 18. The components of X must be unsaturated C6 cyclic hydrocarbons whose hydrogens sum to 18. The most plausible candidates are **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and a **cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n    *   `10 + 8 = 18`. This is consistent.\n    *   A cyclohexadiene isomer that is not conjugated is **1,4-cyclohexadiene**. Cyclohexene has only one double bond, so it cannot be conjugated. The condition \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" is satisfied.\n    *   The reaction `C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) + C6H10 (cyclohexene) -> C6H6 (benzene) + C6H12 (cyclohexane)` is a known hydrogen transfer reaction. The diene gives up 2 hydrogens to the ene. Everything is consistent.\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, which we calculated to be 18.\n\nFinal Answer based on the options:\nA) 22\nB) 16\nC) 18\nD) 12\n\nThe calculated value is 18, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 60:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let its formula be CxHy.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by: Mass%(H) = (y * M(H)) / (x * M(C) + y * M(H)), where M are molar masses.\n    *   Using approximate integer masses (M(H)≈1, M(C)≈12): 0.1428 ≈ y / (12x + y).\n    *   This fraction 0.1428 is very close to 1/7. 1/7 ≈ 0.142857.\n    *   So, y / (12x + y) ≈ 1/7  => 7y ≈ 12x + y => 6y ≈ 12x => y ≈ 2x.\n    *   This means the empirical formula of Z is CH2.\n    *   The general formula for a saturated acyclic hydrocarbon (alkane) is CnH2n+2. The mass % of H would be (2n+2)/(14n+2).\n    *   The general formula for a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon (cycloalkane) is CnH2n. The mass % of H is (2n)/(14n) = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%.\n    *   This perfectly matches the given data. So, Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states that Z is a widely used solvent and is stable, which points towards common cycloalkanes like cyclopentane or cyclohexane.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reactions and Mixtures**\n    *   **Hydrogenation:** Mixture X (two liquids A and B) and mixture Y (two liquids C and D) both yield *only* Z upon hydrogenation under severe conditions. This implies that A, B, C, and D all have the same number of carbon atoms and the same carbon skeleton as Z, or a skeleton that can be converted to Z's skeleton under these conditions (e.g., through isomerization or ring expansion/contraction).\n    *   **Mixture Y:** Y does not decolorize bromine water. This indicates its components are saturated (contain no C=C or C≡C bonds). An exception is aromatic rings, which do not react with bromine water under these conditions. Z is a component of Y. So let C = Z. Since C is saturated (a cycloalkane), it will not decolorize bromine water. The other component, D, must also not decolorize bromine water.\n    *   **The Disproportionation Reaction:** Mixture X is converted to Mixture Y via a disproportionation reaction on a platinum catalyst. A disproportionation reaction is a redox reaction where a substance is simultaneously oxidized and reduced. In this context, it refers to a hydrogen transfer reaction where some molecules gain hydrogen (are reduced) and others lose hydrogen (are oxidized).\n\n3.  **Deduce the Identities of Y and Z**\n    *   The classic example of such a disproportionation is the Zelinsky-Kazansky reaction. For example, cyclohexene disproportionates over platinum to form cyclohexane and benzene. Let's test this model.\n    *   Let's hypothesize that the reaction produces a cycloalkane (saturated) and an aromatic compound (which doesn't decolorize Br2 water). This would fit the description of Y.\n    *   If we assume a 6-carbon skeleton (based on cyclohexane being a very common solvent and benzene being the simplest aromatic product), we can propose:\n        *   Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12). Mass %H = 12/84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%. This fits.\n        *   Y = A mixture of Cyclohexane (Z) and Benzene (C6H6).\n    *   Let's check this hypothesis for Y against the facts:\n        *   Y is a mixture of two liquids? Yes, cyclohexane and benzene are liquids.\n        *   Y does not decolorize bromine water? Yes, cyclohexane is saturated, and benzene does not react.\n        *   Z is a constituent of Y? Yes, cyclohexane is a component.\n        *   Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z? Hydrogenation of cyclohexane gives cyclohexane. Hydrogenation of benzene gives cyclohexane. So, yes, the only product is Z.\n    *   This hypothesis (Y = {Cyclohexane, Benzene}) is consistent with all the facts.\n\n4.  **Deduce the Identities of X**\n    *   Mixture X = {A, B} is equimolar.\n    *   Mixture Y = {Cyclohexane, Benzene} is also equimolar.\n    *   This strongly suggests a 1:1 reaction stoichiometry: A + B -> Cyclohexane + Benzene.\n    *   This is an intermolecular hydrogen transfer. One molecule (A) is reduced to cyclohexane (C6H12), and the other (B) is oxidized to benzene (C6H6).\n    *   Let's look at the hydrogen balance. Let A = C6Ha and B = C6Hb.\n        *   Ha + Hb = H(cyclohexane) + H(benzene) = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   Now let's identify A and B from the properties of mixture X:\n        *   They are C6-based compounds whose skeletons hydrogenate to cyclohexane. This suggests they are cyclic C6 compounds.\n        *   They decolorize bromine water, so they are unsaturated (contain at least one C=C bond).\n        *   They do not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   We need two such compounds, C6Ha and C6Hb, where a+b=18.\n        *   Let's consider possible cyclic C6 alkenes/alkadienes.\n        *   **Cyclohexene (C6H10)**: One C=C bond. Not conjugated. Hydrogenates to cyclohexane. A strong candidate for A. If A is C6H10, then Ha = 10.\n        *   **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**: Two C=C bonds, but they are not conjugated (separated by two single bonds). Hydrogenates to cyclohexane. A strong candidate for B. If B is C6H8, then Hb = 8.\n    *   Let's check the sum of hydrogens: Ha + Hb = 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our requirement.\n    *   The proposed reaction is:\n        **C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)**\n    *   In this reaction, the diene is oxidized (loses 2H) and the monoene is reduced (gains 2H). It's a balanced redox process that produces the products in a 1:1 molar ratio, consistent with Y being an equimolar mixture. All components of X and Y hydrogenate to cyclohexane. X has no conjugated bonds and decolorizes bromine water. Y does not. This model fits all constraints perfectly.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of liquid A and one molecule of liquid B.\n    *   Molecule A = Cyclohexene (C6H10), which has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Molecule B = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8), which has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>."
