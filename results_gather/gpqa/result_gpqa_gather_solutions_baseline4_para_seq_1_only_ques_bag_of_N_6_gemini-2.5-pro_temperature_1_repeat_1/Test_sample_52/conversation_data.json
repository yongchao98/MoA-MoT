The FTIR spectrum of this compound shows absorption peaks indicating the presence of an ester group. The 1H NMR spectrum shows six signals: two signals corresponding to aromatic-H, two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups. There are no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, or C12H14O2.\n\nA) C11H14O2\nB) C11H12O2\nC) C12H14O2\nD) C12H12O2\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the given structural information:**\n    *   The compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This means we start with a benzene ring (C6H6) and replace two hydrogens with substituents. The core of the molecule is therefore a C6H4 group.\n    *   The FTIR spectrum shows an ester group is present. The general formula for an ester is R-COO-R'. This group contains two oxygen atoms.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR spectrum data:**\n    *   **Two signals corresponding to aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons (C6H4). The presence of only two signals suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, likely a para (1,4) substitution, which would give two sets of chemically equivalent protons. This confirms the C6H4 fragment, contributing 6 carbons and 4 hydrogens.\n    *   **Two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets):** This splitting pattern is a classic indicator of a propenyl group, specifically `-CH=CH-CH3`, attached to another group (in this case, the aromatic ring).\n        *   Let's analyze the protons: `(Aryl)-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3`.\n        *   The proton `H(a)` is split by `H(b)` into a doublet.\n        *   The proton `H(b)` is split by `H(a)` (a doublet) and the three protons of the `-CH3` group (a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets (dq).\n        *   This confirms the presence of a `-CH=CH-CH3` fragment. This fragment contributes 3 carbons and (1+1+3) = 5 hydrogens.\n    *   **Two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups:** One methyl group is part of the propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`) we just identified. The second methyl group must belong to the ester substituent.\n    *   **No signals corresponding to –CH2 groups:** This is a critical piece of information. The ester group cannot be, for example, `-COOCH2CH3` or `-CH2COOCH3` as these would produce `-CH2-` signals. The only simple ester structure containing a methyl group and no methylene group is a methyl ester, `-COOCH3`. This fragment contributes 2 carbons, 3 hydrogens, and 2 oxygens.\n\n3.  **Assemble the molecular formula from the identified fragments:**\n    *   **Fragment 1 (Aromatic Ring):** C6H4\n    *   **Fragment 2 (Propenyl Group):** C3H5 (`-CH=CH-CH3`)\n    *   **Fragment 3 (Methyl Ester Group):** C2H3O2 (`-COOCH3`)\n\n4.  **Sum the atoms from all fragments:**\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from ester) = 11\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from ester) = 12\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 0 + 0 + 2 (from ester) = 2\n\n5.  **Final Molecular Formula:** The deduced formula is C11H12O2.\n\n6.  **Verify with the provided options:**\n    *   A) C11H14O2\n    *   B) C11H12O2\n    *   C) C12H12O2\n    *   D) C12H14O2\n    Our calculated formula, C11H12O2, matches option B. The python code execution also confirmed this calculation.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the structural information:**\n    *   The compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This means we start with a benzene ring that has two hydrogen atoms replaced by other groups. The core of this part of the molecule is C6H4. The 1H NMR spectrum shows two signals for aromatic protons, which is characteristic of a para (1,4) substitution pattern, where the four protons on the ring are chemically equivalent in two sets of two.\n\n2.  **Analyze the FTIR information:**\n    *   The FTIR spectrum shows an \"ester group\". An ester functional group has the general structure R-COO-R' and contains one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms (-COO-).\n\n3.  **Analyze the 1H NMR spectral data:**\n    *   **Six signals total:** This indicates six different types of protons in the molecule.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** As mentioned, this corresponds to the four protons on the C6H4 ring.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This is a very specific and informative splitting pattern. A \"doublet of quartets\" (dq) arises when a proton is split by one adjacent proton (giving a doublet) and also by three adjacent protons of a methyl group (giving a quartet). A \"doublet\" (d) arises when a proton is split by only one adjacent proton. This pattern strongly indicates the presence of a propenyl group: -CH=CH-CH3.\n        *   Let's label the protons: -CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3.\n        *   Proton H(b) is adjacent to H(a) and the -CH3 group. It will be split into a doublet by H(a) and a quartet by the -CH3 group, resulting in a **doublet of quartets**.\n        *   Proton H(a) is adjacent only to H(b). It will be split into a **doublet**.\n        *   This fragment perfectly matches the description. The formula for this propenyl group is C3H5 (2 vinyl H + 3 methyl H).\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:** We have identified one -CH3 group from the propenyl fragment. The second -CH3 signal must come from the other substituent.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a crucial constraint. It tells us that there are no methylene bridges in the molecule.\n\n4.  **Assemble the molecular fragments:**\n    *   We have a C6H4 ring.\n    *   We have a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) as one substituent.\n    *   The other substituent is an ester that must contain the second -CH3 group but no -CH2 groups. Let's consider the possibilities for an ester R-COO-R':\n        *   If the ester is attached to the ring through the carbonyl carbon (e.g., a substituted methyl benzoate), the R' part must be the methyl group to avoid a -CH2-. The substituent would be **-COOCH3**. This fragment contains one -CH3 group and no -CH2 groups. This fits.\n        *   If the ester is attached to the ring through the oxygen (e.g., a substituted phenyl acetate), the R part must be the methyl group to avoid a -CH2-. The substituent would be **-O-CO-CH3**. This fragment also contains one -CH3 group and no -CH2 groups. This also fits.\n    *   Both possibilities for the ester substituent have the same atomic composition: C2H3O2.\n\n5.  **Calculate the total molecular formula:**\n    *   Let's sum the atoms from the identified fragments:\n        *   Aromatic ring: C6H4\n        *   Propenyl substituent: C3H5 (-CH=CH-CH3)\n        *   Ester substituent: C2H3O2 (-COOCH3 or -OCOCH3)\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from ester) = 11\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from ester) = 12\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from ester)\n    *   The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n6.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   A) C11H14O2\n    *   B) C12H12O2\n    *   C) C12H14O2\n    *   D) C11H12O2\n    *   Our calculated formula, C11H12O2, matches option D. The other formulas are inconsistent with the spectral data. For example, C11H14O2 and C12H14O2 have more hydrogen atoms, which would imply fewer double bonds or rings, contradicting the presence of both an aromatic ring and a vinyl group. C12H12O2 has an extra carbon atom that cannot be accounted for without violating the \"no -CH2 groups\" or \"di-substituted\" rules.\n\nTherefore, based on a logical deduction from the provided spectroscopic information, the chemical formula of the compound is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Spectroscopic Data\n\nFirst, let's break down the information provided by each spectroscopic technique.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** The presence of absorption peaks for an ester group is noted. An ester functional group has the structure R-COO-R' and contains one carbonyl group (C=O) and two oxygen atoms. All the given formula options (C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2) contain two oxygen atoms, which is consistent with this finding.\n\n*   **Structure:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means it is a benzene ring (C6H6) where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by two substituent groups. The core of the molecule is therefore a C6H4 group, which has 4 aromatic protons.\n\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum:** This provides the most detailed information about the structure.\n    *   **Six signals:** This indicates there are six chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons. Having only two signals suggests a symmetric substitution pattern, such as para (1,4-substitution), which would give two signals (two doublets), each integrating to 2H. This is consistent with the C6H4 core.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** Vinyl protons are attached to a C=C double bond. This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a propenyl group, **-CH=CH-CH3**.\n        *   Let's label the protons: -CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3.\n        *   H(a) is split by H(b), resulting in a **doublet**.\n        *   H(b) is split by H(a) (a doublet) and the three protons of the -CH3 group (a quartet), resulting in a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n        *   This fragment contains one C=C double bond.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:**\n        *   One of these signals corresponds to the methyl group in the propenyl fragment (-CH=CH-CH3). This methyl group's signal is split by H(b), resulting in a doublet.\n        *   The second -CH3 signal must belong to the ester group. Since the problem states there are **no signals for -CH2 groups**, it cannot be part of an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3). Therefore, it must be a methyl group directly attached to the ester, either as a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate ester (-OOCCH3). In either case, this methyl group is isolated and would appear as a singlet.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a crucial piece of information that helps eliminate several possibilities.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation tells us the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\nFrom the spectral data, we can sum the expected DBE:\n*   Aromatic ring: 1 ring + 3 π-bonds = 4 DBE\n*   Vinyl group (C=C): 1 π-bond = 1 DBE\n*   Ester group (C=O): 1 π-bond = 1 DBE\n*   **Total required DBE = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6**\n\nNow, let's calculate the DBE for each of the given formulas using the formula: DBE = C - H/2 + 1 (for a compound with formula CxHyO2).\n\n*   **A) C12H12O2:** DBE = 12 - (12/2) + 1 = 12 - 6 + 1 = 7. (Incorrect)\n*   **B) C12H14O2:** DBE = 12 - (14/2) + 1 = 12 - 7 + 1 = 6. (Possible)\n*   **C) C11H14O2:** DBE = 11 - (14/2) + 1 = 11 - 7 + 1 = 5. (Incorrect)\n*   **D) C11H12O2:** DBE = 11 - (12/2) + 1 = 11 - 6 + 1 = 6. (Possible)\n\nThis analysis eliminates options A and C. We are left with C12H14O2 and C11H12O2.\n\n### 3. Assemble the Molecular Structure and Final Verification\n\nLet's build the molecule from the fragments we've identified from the NMR data:\n1.  A di-substituted benzene ring: **C6H4** (contributes 4H)\n2.  A propenyl group substituent: **-CH=CH-CH3** (contributes C3H5)\n3.  An ester substituent containing a methyl group, e.g., a methyl carboxylate group (**-COOCH3**, contributes C2H3O2) or an acetoxy group (**-OCOCH3**, contributes C2H3O2).\n\nLet's assemble these pieces and sum the atoms. For example, a possible structure is methyl 4-propenylbenzoate:\n*   **C atoms:** 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5) + 2 (from COOCH3) = **11 carbons**\n*   **H atoms:** 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from C3H5) + 3 (from COOCH3) = **12 hydrogens**\n*   **O atoms:** 2 (from COOCH3) = **2 oxygens**\n\nThe resulting formula is **C11H12O2**. This structure is fully consistent with all the provided data:\n*   It has the correct DBE of 6.\n*   It is a di-substituted aromatic ring.\n*   It has an ester group.\n*   It contains a propenyl group giving the characteristic vinyl signals.\n*   It has two distinct methyl groups.\n*   It contains no CH2 groups.\n*   The total proton count (12H) matches the formula.\n\nNow, let's consider the other possibility, **C12H14O2**.\n*   This formula has the correct DBE of 6.\n*   However, compared to C11H12O2, it has one extra carbon and two extra hydrogens (a \"CH2\" unit).\n*   To incorporate a CH2 unit into our proposed structure would create a -CH2- signal in the NMR spectrum.\n*   The problem explicitly states there are **no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups**.\n*   Furthermore, if we analyze the proton count for C12H14O2: Total H = 14. Aromatic H = 4. Vinyl H = 2. This leaves 14 - 4 - 2 = 8 protons. These 8 protons would have to be distributed among methyl groups (since CH2 is forbidden), which is impossible as 8 is not a multiple of 3.\n\nTherefore, the formula C12H14O2 is inconsistent with the NMR data.\n\nThe only formula that perfectly matches all the constraints from the FTIR and 1H NMR data is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Functional Groups from FTIR:** The problem states that the FTIR spectrum shows absorption peaks indicating an ester group. An ester group has the general formula R-COO-R' and contains two oxygen atoms. All the given options (C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2) have two oxygen atoms, which is consistent with this information.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum to Identify Structural Fragments and Proton Count:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. Two signals for the aromatic protons typically suggest a symmetrical substitution pattern, most commonly a 1,4- (para-) disubstituted benzene ring. A para-substituted ring has 4 aromatic protons (C6**H4**), which appear as two distinct signals (an AA'BB' system, often simplified to two doublets). Thus, we have **4 aromatic protons**.\n    *   **Vinyl-H (2 signals):** There are two signals for vinyl protons (protons on a C=C double bond). One is a doublet (d) and the other is a doublet of quartets (dq). This splitting pattern is highly characteristic of a propenyl group, **-CH=CH-CH3**.\n        *   The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and by the three protons of the methyl group (each peak of the doublet becomes a quartet). This results in a doublet of quartets (dq). This accounts for **1 vinyl proton**.\n        *   The other vinyl proton is split only by the first vinyl proton, resulting in a doublet (d). This accounts for the second **1 vinyl proton**.\n    *   **–CH3 Groups (2 signals):** There are two signals for methyl groups.\n        *   One of these signals corresponds to the methyl group in the propenyl fragment (-CH=CH-**CH3**), which accounts for **3 protons**.\n        *   The second methyl signal must come from the ester group. Since the problem states there are no –CH2 groups, the ester must be either a methyl ester (e.g., -COO**CH3**) or an acetate ester (e.g., -O-CO-**CH3**). Both contain a methyl group, which accounts for another **3 protons**.\n    *   **No –CH2 Groups:** This is a crucial piece of negative evidence. It confirms that there are no ethyl, propyl, or other alkyl chains containing a -CH2- unit.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms:**\n    Based on the NMR analysis, we can sum the number of protons in the molecule:\n    Total H = (Aromatic H) + (Vinyl H) + (Methyl H)\n    Total H = 4 + (1 + 1) + (3 + 3) = **12 hydrogens**.\n\n4.  **Eliminate Incorrect Options:**\n    The molecular formula must contain 12 hydrogen atoms. Let's look at the options:\n    A) C12H12O2 (12 H) - Possible\n    B) C11H14O2 (14 H) - **Eliminated**\n    C) C11H12O2 (12 H) - Possible\n    D) C12H14O2 (14 H) - **Eliminated**\n    We are now left with two choices: C12H12O2 and C11H12O2.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Number of Carbon Atoms:**\n    Now, let's assemble the fragments we've identified and count the carbon atoms:\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** A di-substituted benzene ring (**C6**H4) contributes **6 carbons**.\n    *   **Propenyl Group:** The -CH=CH-CH3 group contributes **3 carbons**.\n    *   **Ester Group:** The ester group containing a methyl group, either -**C**OO**C**H3 or -O**C**O**C**H3, contributes **2 carbons**.\n\n    Total C = (Ring C) + (Propenyl C) + (Ester C)\n    Total C = 6 + 3 + 2 = **11 carbons**.\n\n6.  **Determine the Final Chemical Formula:**\n    Based on our analysis, the molecule contains 11 carbon atoms, 12 hydrogen atoms, and 2 oxygen atoms.\n    The chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n7.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    The DBE for C11H12O2 is calculated as: DBE = C + 1 - H/2 = 11 + 1 - 12/2 = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    The proposed structure contains:\n    *   One benzene ring (4 DBEs)\n    *   One C=C double bond in the propenyl group (1 DBE)\n    *   One C=O double bond in the ester group (1 DBE)\n    Total DBE = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n    The calculated DBE matches the structural features deduced from the spectra, confirming our conclusion.\n\nComparing our result with the remaining options, C11H12O2 is the correct choice.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Structure:** The problem states the compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This means we start with a benzene ring (C6H6) that has two hydrogen atoms replaced by two substituent groups. The core of the molecule is therefore a C6H4 group.\n\n2.  **Identify the First Substituent (Ester Group):**\n    *   The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of an ester group, which has the general structure R-COO-R'.\n    *   The 1H NMR spectrum provides a crucial clue: \"There are no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups.\" This rules out common ester types like ethyl esters (-COOCH2CH3) or propyl esters, as they contain -CH2- groups.\n    *   The simplest ester that does not have a -CH2- group is a methyl ester (-COOCH3).\n    *   The presence of a methyl ester is consistent with the 1H NMR data, which shows \"two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups\". One of these signals would be from the methyl ester's -CH3 group.\n    *   So, the first substituent is a methyl ester group: **-COOCH3**. This fragment contains **2 carbons, 3 hydrogens, and 2 oxygens**.\n\n3.  **Identify the Second Substituent:**\n    *   We need to account for the remaining signals in the 1H NMR spectrum. We have already accounted for one -CH3 signal. The remaining signals are:\n        *   Two signals for aromatic-H (these are on the C6H4 ring itself).\n        *   Two signals for vinyl-H (protons on a C=C double bond).\n        *   One more signal for a -CH3 group.\n    *   The vinyl-H signals are described as \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\". This specific splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group, specifically **-CH=CH-CH3**.\n        *   Let's label the protons: Ar-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3(c).\n        *   The signal for H(b) is split by H(a) (a doublet) and by the three protons of the CH3(c) group (a quartet), resulting in a **doublet of quartets**.\n        *   The signal for H(a) is split only by H(b), resulting in a **doublet**.\n        *   The signal for the CH3(c) group is split by H(b), resulting in a doublet. This accounts for the second -CH3 signal.\n    *   This -CH=CH-CH3 group perfectly matches the NMR description. This fragment contains **3 carbons and 5 hydrogens**.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Formula:**\n    *   Now, we combine all the identified parts of the molecule:\n        *   Aromatic ring: **C6H4**\n        *   First substituent (methyl ester): **C2H3O2** (from -COOCH3)\n        *   Second substituent (propenyl group): **C3H5** (from -CH=CH-CH3)\n    *   Sum the atoms from all fragments to find the total molecular formula:\n        *   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 2 + 3 = 11\n        *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 3 + 5 = 12\n        *   **Oxygen (O):** 2\n    *   The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n5.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   The calculated formula, C11H12O2, matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Structure:** The problem states the compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This means we have a benzene ring (C6H6) where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by two substituent groups. The core of the molecule is therefore a C6H4 group.\n\n2.  **Interpret the 1H NMR Data for the Aromatic Ring:** The 1H NMR spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\". In a di-substituted benzene ring, having only two signals for the four aromatic protons is a strong indication of a symmetrical substitution pattern. Specifically, this points to **1,4- (para) substitution**. In a para-substituted ring, the four protons are chemically equivalent in two sets of two, leading to two signals (typically two doublets). So, we have a C6H4 core.\n\n3.  **Identify the First Substituent from NMR Data:** The spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\". This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)** attached to the ring.\n    *   Let's label the protons: `Ring-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3`.\n    *   The signal for proton H(b) is split by the adjacent vinyl proton H(a) into a **doublet**, and it's also split by the three protons of the -CH3 group into a **quartet**. This results in a **doublet of quartets**.\n    *   The signal for proton H(a) is split only by the adjacent vinyl proton H(b), resulting in a **doublet**.\n    *   This perfectly matches the description. This propenyl group has the formula **-C3H5**. It also accounts for one of the two -CH3 signals mentioned.\n\n4.  **Identify the Second Substituent from FTIR and NMR Data:**\n    *   The FTIR spectrum shows an **ester group (-COO-)**.\n    *   The 1H NMR spectrum shows a second **-CH3 signal** and, crucially, **no signals corresponding to -CH2 groups**.\n    *   We need to form a substituent that contains an ester group and a methyl group, but no methylene (-CH2-) groups. There are two possibilities for this substituent, which is attached to the C6H4 ring:\n        *   A methyl ester group: **-COOCH3**. This fragment contains the ester, a -CH3 group, and no -CH2 groups.\n        *   An acetoxy group: **-OCOCH3**. This fragment also contains the ester, a -CH3 group, and no -CH2 groups.\n    *   Both of these possible groups have the same chemical formula: **-C2H3O2**.\n\n5.  **Assemble the Molecular Formula:** Now we can sum the atoms from all the identified parts of the molecule to find the total chemical formula.\n    *   **From the para-substituted ring:** C6H4\n    *   **From the propenyl group:** C3H5\n    *   **From the ester-containing group:** C2H3O2\n\n    Let's add them up:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 0 + 0 + 2 = **2**\n\n    The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:** The calculated formula, C11H12O2, matches option A.\n\nLet's perform a final check using the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for C11H12O2:\n*   DoU = C + 1 - H/2 = 11 + 1 - 12/2 = 12 - 6 = 6.\nOur proposed structure contains:\n*   1 benzene ring (4 degrees of unsaturation)\n*   1 C=C double bond in the propenyl group (1 degree of unsaturation)\n*   1 C=O double bond in the ester group (1 degree of unsaturation)\n*   Total DoU = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\nThe calculated DoU matches the structure, confirming our analysis.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Functional Groups and Degrees of Unsaturation (DBE)**\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This is a benzene ring (C6H4). A benzene ring has 1 ring and 3 double bonds, which corresponds to 4 degrees of unsaturation (DBE).\n*   **FTIR shows an ester group:** An ester group has the structure R-COO-R'. It contains a carbonyl group (C=O), which corresponds to 1 DBE. It also accounts for the two oxygen atoms in the molecular formula.\n*   **1H NMR shows two vinyl-H signals:** Vinyl protons are protons attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). This C=C double bond corresponds to 1 DBE.\n*   **Total Expected DBE:** Summing the degrees of unsaturation from the identified functional groups: 4 (aromatic ring) + 1 (ester C=O) + 1 (vinyl C=C) = 6 DBE.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the DBE for Each of the Proposed Formulas**\n\nThe formula for calculating the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) for a molecule with formula CxHyOz is:\nDBE = x - y/2 + 1\n\nLet's calculate the DBE for each option:\n*   **A) C11H12O2:** DBE = 11 - (12/2) + 1 = 11 - 6 + 1 = 6. This **matches** our expected DBE.\n*   **B) C11H14O2:** DBE = 11 - (14/2) + 1 = 11 - 7 + 1 = 5. This does not match. A DBE of 5 would mean one of the double bonds (likely the vinyl C=C) is missing, which contradicts the NMR data.\n*   **C) C12H14O2:** DBE = 12 - (14/2) + 1 = 12 - 7 + 1 = 6. This **matches** our expected DBE.\n*   **D) C12H12O2:** DBE = 12 - (12/2) + 1 = 12 - 6 + 1 = 7. This does not match. A DBE of 7 implies an additional ring or double bond not accounted for by the provided spectral data.\n\nBased on the DBE calculation, we can eliminate options B and D. We are left with options A and C.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Proton Count from the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's determine the total number of hydrogen atoms (protons) in the molecule from the NMR data.\n*   **Two signals corresponding to aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 protons attached to it. So, this accounts for **4H**.\n*   **Two signals corresponding to vinyl-H:** This means there are two distinct protons on a C=C double bond. This accounts for **2H**. (The doublet and doublet of quartets pattern strongly suggests a -CH=CH-CH3 group).\n*   **Two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups:** This indicates two non-equivalent methyl groups. Each methyl group has 3 protons. So, this accounts for 2 * 3H = **6H**.\n*   **No signals corresponding to –CH2 groups:** This confirms the absence of methylene groups.\n\n**Total Proton Count:** 4H (aromatic) + 2H (vinyl) + 6H (methyl) = **12H**.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Proton Count with the Remaining Options**\n\nNow we compare this total proton count with the number of hydrogens in the remaining possible formulas:\n*   **A) C11H12O2:** This formula has **12 hydrogens**. This **matches** our calculated proton count.\n*   **C) C12H14O2:** This formula has **14 hydrogens**. This **does not match** our calculated proton count.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly the chemical formula **C11H12O2** is consistent with all the information provided:\n1.  It has the correct number of oxygen atoms (2) for an ester.\n2.  Its degree of unsaturation (DBE=6) matches the structural features (aromatic ring, ester C=O, vinyl C=C).\n3.  Its number of hydrogen atoms (12) matches the total proton count from the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\nA plausible structure that fits all the data is methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate, which has the formula C11H12O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nBased on the analysis, here is the final answer.\n\n**1. Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)**\n\nFrom the problem description, we can deduce the structural components:\n*   A 6-membered aromatic ring (benzene ring) has a DBE of 4 (1 ring + 3 double bonds).\n*   An ester group (-COO-) contains a C=O double bond, contributing 1 to the DBE.\n*   The presence of two vinyl-H signals indicates a C=C double bond, contributing another 1 to the DBE.\n\nTherefore, the total required Degree of Unsaturation for the molecule is 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n\n**2. Check the DBE for Each Option**\n\nThe python script calculated the DBE for each of the given chemical formulas:\n*   C11H14O2: DBE = 5\n*   C12H14O2: DBE = 6\n*   C12H12O2: DBE = 7\n*   C11H12O2: DBE = 6\n\nThis eliminates options A (C11H14O2) and C (C12H12O2) because their DBE values do not match the required DBE of 6. We are left with options B and D.\n\n**3. Analyze the 1H NMR Data to Differentiate Between B and D**\n\nLet's propose a structure that fits all the NMR data:\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with two signals:** This suggests a para (1,4) substitution pattern due to the symmetry, resulting in only two types of aromatic protons.\n*   **Two vinyl-H signals (doublet and doublet of quartets):** This is the classic splitting pattern for a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3).\n*   **Two -CH3 signals:** One methyl group is part of the propenyl group. The second methyl group must be part of the ester, indicating a methyl ester (-COOCH3).\n*   **No -CH2 signals:** This is a crucial piece of information.\n\nLet's assemble a structure with these pieces: a propenyl group and a methyl ester group on a benzene ring in the para position. The structure is **methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate**.\n\nLet's check the formula for this proposed structure:\n*   Carbons: 3 (from propenyl) + 6 (from ring) + 1 (from C=O) + 1 (from O-CH3) = 11 carbons.\n*   Hydrogens: 3 (from propenyl-CH3) + 1 (from vinyl) + 1 (from vinyl) + 4 (from ring) + 3 (from ester-CH3) = 12 hydrogens.\n*   Oxygens: 2 (from ester).\nThe chemical formula is **C11H12O2**. This structure has no -CH2- groups, which is consistent with the NMR data.\n\nNow, let's consider the other possibility, C12H14O2 (Option B). This formula has one extra carbon and two extra hydrogens (a -CH2- unit) compared to C11H12O2. A plausible structure would be **ethyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate**, which has an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3). However, this structure contains a -CH2- group, which would produce a signal in the 1H NMR spectrum. Since the problem explicitly states there are no signals for -CH2- groups, C12H14O2 is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the given information:**\n    *   **Structure:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This implies a `C6H4` core.\n    *   **FTIR:** An ester group (`-COO-`) is present. This accounts for the two oxygen atoms in all the proposed formulas. An ester group also contains a carbonyl (`C=O`) bond.\n    *   **1H NMR Spectrum:** This provides the most detailed information about the structure.\n        *   **Six total signals:** This means there are six chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n        *   **Two aromatic-H signals:** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons (`-C6H4-`). Two signals for these 4 protons strongly suggest a para-substitution pattern (1,4-disubstituted), where the protons are split into two groups of two, each appearing as a doublet (an AA'BB' system).\n        *   **Two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** Vinyl protons are attached to a `C=C` double bond. This specific splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`) attached to a group with no adjacent protons (like our aromatic ring).\n            *   Let's label the group as `Ar-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3`.\n            *   Proton `H(b)` is split by `H(a)` (into a doublet) and by the three protons of the `-CH3` group (into a quartet). The combined splitting results in a **doublet of quartets**.\n            *   Proton `H(a)` is split only by `H(b)` (into a **doublet**).\n            *   This confirms the presence of a `-CH=CH-CH3` group. This fragment has the formula `C3H5` and contains one of the two methyl groups.\n        *   **Two -CH3 group signals:** We have identified one `-CH3` group as part of the propenyl substituent. The second `-CH3` signal must belong to the ester group. This means the ester is either a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetoxy group (`-OCOCH3`).\n        *   **No -CH2 group signals:** This is a crucial piece of negative evidence. It rules out the presence of any ethyl, propyl, or other alkyl chains containing a methylene (`-CH2-`) unit.\n\n2.  **Assemble the molecular fragments:**\n    Based on the analysis, the molecule is composed of the following pieces:\n    *   A di-substituted benzene ring: `C6H4`\n    *   A propenyl group: `C3H5` (which contains two vinyl protons and one methyl group)\n    *   An ester functionality which must also contain the second methyl group. This can be either:\n        *   A methyl ester group: `-COOCH3` (formula `C2H3O2`)\n        *   An acetoxy group: `-OCOCH3` (formula `C2H3O2`)\n\n3.  **Calculate the total molecular formula:**\n    Let's sum the atoms from the identified fragments regardless of which type of ester it is.\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from `C6H4` ring) + 3 (from `C3H5` propenyl group) + 2 (from `C2H3O2` ester/methyl part) = **11 Carbons**\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from `C6H4` ring) + 5 (from `C3H5` propenyl group) + 3 (from the ester's `CH3` group) = **12 Hydrogens**\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group) = **2 Oxygens**\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   A) C12H14O2: Incorrect. This would require an additional `CH2` group, which is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data.\n    *   B) C11H14O2: Incorrect. This formula has two more hydrogens than our derived formula. This would imply the absence of the `C=C` double bond in the propenyl group (i.e., it would be a propyl group), contradicting the vinyl-H signals.\n    *   C) C12H12O2: Incorrect. This formula has an extra carbon compared to our derived structure. It is not possible to add a carbon atom without either adding hydrogens (which would change the formula to something else) or violating the \"no -CH2-\" rule.\n    *   D) C11H12O2: Correct. This formula perfectly matches the structure deduced from the spectroscopic data.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The detailed analysis of the FTIR and especially the 1H NMR data allows for the unambiguous assembly of the molecular fragments into a structure whose formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct chemical formula:\n\n**1. Analyze the Spectroscopic Data**\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This tells us the core of the molecule is a benzene ring (C6H4) with two groups attached. The formula of this fragment is C6H4.\n*   **FTIR shows an ester group:** The molecule contains a -COO- functional group. This accounts for the two oxygen atoms in all the proposed formulas. An ester group also contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **Six signals total:** This indicates six chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring can be ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4). For two different substituents, a para-substituted ring gives the simplest spectrum, often appearing as two distinct signals (two doublets, an AA'BB' system). This is the most likely pattern for only two aromatic signals.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This is a classic pattern for a `-CH=CH-CH3` group.\n        *   Let's call the protons `R-CHa=CHb-CH3`.\n        *   Proton Ha is adjacent to proton Hb, so it is split into a **doublet**.\n        *   Proton Hb is adjacent to proton Ha (1 proton) and the -CH3 group (3 protons). It is split into a doublet by Ha and a quartet by the -CH3 group, resulting in a **doublet of quartets**.\n        *   This confirms the presence of a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`), which has the formula C3H5.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:**\n        *   One -CH3 signal comes from the propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`) we just identified.\n        *   The second -CH3 signal must belong to the other substituent, which contains the ester group.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a crucial constraint. The molecule contains no methylene (`-CH2-`) groups. This rules out substituents like ethyl (`-CH2CH3`), propyl (`-CH2CH2CH3`), etc. The second methyl group must be directly attached to a part of the ester that has no other adjacent protons, for example, a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate group (`-OCOCH3`).\n\n**2. Assemble the Molecular Fragments**\n\nBased on the analysis, we have the following pieces:\n*   A para-substituted benzene ring: `C6H4`\n*   A propenyl group: `-CH=CH-CH3` (formula `C3H5`)\n*   An ester group containing a methyl group, with no CH2 groups. The two possibilities are:\n    *   A methyl ester group: `-COOCH3` (formula `C2H3O2`)\n    *   An acetate group attached to the ring via oxygen: `-OCOCH3` (formula `C2H3O2`)\n\nLet's combine these fragments to build the whole molecule and determine its formula.\n*   Carbons: `C6` (from ring) + `C3` (from propenyl) + `C2` (from ester part) = **C11**\n*   Hydrogens: `H4` (from ring) + `H5` (from propenyl) + `H3` (from methyl ester/acetate) = **H12**\n*   Oxygens: `O2` (from ester)\n\nThe assembled molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**3. Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)**\n\nThe DBE (or index of hydrogen deficiency) tells us the total number of rings and pi bonds.\n*   **From the structure:** Benzene ring (1 ring + 3 double bonds = 4 DBE) + C=C in propenyl group (1 DBE) + C=O in ester group (1 DBE) = **Total 6 DBE**.\n\nNow, let's calculate the DBE for each of the given options using the formula DBE = C + 1 - H/2:\n*   A) C11H14O2: DBE = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 12 - 7 = 5. (Incorrect, not enough unsaturation)\n*   B) C11H12O2: DBE = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6. (**Matches our structure**)\n*   C) C12H12O2: DBE = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 13 - 6 = 7. (Incorrect, requires an extra ring or double bond not indicated by the data)\n*   D) C12H14O2: DBE = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 13 - 7 = 6. (DBE matches, but this formula is C11H12O2 + CH2. Adding a CH2 group would create a -CH2- signal in the NMR, which is explicitly ruled out).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly the formula C11H12O2 is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic information. It has the correct degree of unsaturation, and a molecule with this formula can be constructed (e.g., methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate) that perfectly matches the described 1H NMR signals without containing any -CH2- groups.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the given information from the problem statement:**\n    *   **Structure:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring (a benzene ring with two groups attached).\n    *   **FTIR:** An ester group (-COO-) is present.\n    *   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n        *   Six signals in total.\n        *   Two signals for aromatic protons (Ar-H).\n        *   Two signals for vinyl protons (-CH=CH-). One is a doublet (d), and the other is a doublet of quartets (dq).\n        *   Two signals for methyl protons (-CH3).\n        *   No signals for methylene protons (-CH2-).\n\n2.  **Deduce the structural fragments from the spectroscopic data:**\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** A di-substituted benzene ring has the formula C6H4. The presence of only two signals for the four aromatic protons strongly suggests a para (1,4) substitution pattern, which has a plane of symmetry, making the protons at positions 2 and 6 equivalent, and the protons at 3 and 5 equivalent. This fragment contributes **C6H4** to the formula.\n    *   **Vinyl Group:** The signal patterns for the vinyl protons are very characteristic. A proton that is a doublet of quartets (dq) is coupled to one other proton (giving the doublet) and a group of three equivalent protons (giving the quartet). This fits a `-CH=CH-CH3` fragment. The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group would be the `dq`. The other vinyl proton would be coupled only to the first vinyl proton, resulting in a doublet (d). This fragment is a propenyl group. It contributes **C3H5** (`-CH=CH-CH3`) to the formula. This also accounts for one of the two -CH3 signals.\n    *   **Ester Group and Second Methyl Group:** The FTIR confirms an ester (-COO-). The NMR shows a second -CH3 signal. This methyl group must be part of the ester functional group. There are two common possibilities: a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetoxy group (`-OCOCH3`). Both possibilities contain one carbonyl carbon, two oxygen atoms, and one methyl group. This fragment contributes **C2H3O2** (`-COOCH3` or `-OCOCH3`) to the formula.\n    *   **Absence of -CH2-:** The explicit mention of no -CH2- signals confirms that our deduced fragments, which contain no -CH2- groups, are likely correct.\n\n3.  **Assemble the fragments and calculate the total molecular formula:**\n    The two substituents on the C6H4 ring are the propenyl group and the ester-containing group.\n    *   **Carbon atoms (C):** 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5 propenyl) + 2 (from C2H3O2 ester) = **11 carbons**.\n    *   **Hydrogen atoms (H):** 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from C3H5 propenyl) + 3 (from C2H3O2 ester) = **12 hydrogens**.\n    *   **Oxygen atoms (O):** 2 (from the ester group) = **2 oxygens**.\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Verify with the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    The DBE (also known as the index of hydrogen deficiency) can be calculated from the formula: DBE = C + 1 - H/2.\n    For C11H12O2: DBE = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**.\n\n    The DBE can also be calculated from the deduced structure:\n    *   Benzene ring = 1 ring + 3 double bonds = 4 DBE\n    *   Vinyl C=C double bond = 1 DBE\n    *   Ester C=O double bond = 1 DBE\n    *   Total DBE = 4 + 1 + 1 = **6**.\n    The calculated DBE from the formula matches the expected DBE from the structure, confirming our result.\n\n5.  **Compare the result with the given options:**\n    A) C11H14O2\n    B) C12H14O2\n    C) C11H12O2\n    D) C12H12O2\n\n    Our calculated formula, C11H12O2, matches option C. Let's briefly check why the other options are incorrect.\n    *   Options A and B have 14 hydrogens. Our analysis shows 12 hydrogens. Furthermore, option B (C12H14O2) contains an additional CH2 group compared to our derived structure (C11H12O2), which is contradicted by the \"no –CH2 groups\" information.\n    *   Option D (C12H12O2) has an extra carbon compared to our derived structure, and it would be impossible to add this carbon without violating one of the other spectral constraints.\n\nTherefore, the correct chemical formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Structural Information:**\n    *   The compound is a **di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring**. This indicates a benzene ring (C6H6) where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by two substituent groups. The core of this part of the molecule is therefore C6H4.\n    *   The FTIR spectrum shows an **ester group**, which has the functional group -COO-. This adds 1 carbon and 2 oxygen atoms to the formula.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:** The NMR spectrum gives us crucial information about the hydrogen environments and their connectivity.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons (C6H4). The fact that they appear as two signals suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely para-substitution (1,4-disubstituted), which would give two doublets. This confirms the C6H4 part of the structure.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This is a very characteristic splitting pattern. It strongly suggests a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) attached to the aromatic ring.\n        *   Let's label the group as Ar-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3.\n        *   The vinyl proton H(a) is split by H(b), resulting in a **doublet**.\n        *   The vinyl proton H(b) is split by H(a) (a doublet) and by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (a quartet). This combined splitting results in a **doublet of quartets**.\n        *   This fragment is -CH=CH-CH3 and contributes 3 carbons and 5 hydrogens.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:** We have identified two separate methyl groups in the structure.\n        *   One methyl group is part of the propenyl substituent (-CH=CH-CH3). Its signal would be a doublet, as it is split by the adjacent vinyl proton H(b).\n        *   The second methyl group must be part of the ester functionality. To give a separate signal (and be consistent with having no -CH2- groups), it is most likely a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate group attached via oxygen (-O-CO-CH3). In either case, this methyl group would be a singlet as it has no adjacent protons to couple with. This fragment contributes 1 carbon and 3 hydrogens.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a key constraint that eliminates many possibilities, such as ethyl esters (-COOCH2CH3) or propyl substituents (-CH2CH2CH3). Our proposed fragments (-CH=CH-CH3 and -COOCH3) adhere to this rule.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Molecular Fragments and Determine the Formula:**\n    Now, let's sum the atoms from all the identified fragments to find the molecular formula.\n    *   **From the aromatic ring:** C6H4\n    *   **From the propenyl group:** C3H5 (-CH=CH-CH3)\n    *   **From the ester group:** C1O2 (-COO-)\n    *   **From the second methyl group:** C1H3 (-CH3)\n\n    Let's combine them. A possible structure is Methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate.\n    *   Total Carbons (C): 6 (ring) + 3 (propenyl) + 1 (ester C=O) + 1 (ester CH3) = **11**\n    *   Total Hydrogens (H): 4 (ring) + 5 (propenyl) + 3 (ester CH3) = **12**\n    *   Total Oxygens (O): **2** (ester)\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    *   A) C12H14O2\n    *   B) C11H14O2\n    *   C) C11H12O2\n    *   D) C12H12O2\n\n    Our deduced formula, C11H12O2, matches option C.\n\n5.  **Verify the Consistency (Sanity Check):**\n    We can calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for our proposed structure and formula.\n    *   DoU = C - H/2 + 1\n    *   For C11H12O2: DoU = 11 - (12/2) + 1 = 11 - 6 + 1 = 6.\n    *   Our structure contains: 1 benzene ring (4 DoU) + 1 C=C double bond (1 DoU) + 1 C=O double bond (1 DoU) = 6 DoU.\n    *   The DoU is consistent. The other formulas either have a different DoU (C11H14O2 has DoU=5, C12H12O2 has DoU=7) or would require adding a -CH2- group (C12H14O2 has DoU=6, but is C11H12O2 + CH2), which is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data.\n\nTherefore, based on a logical interpretation of all the provided spectroscopic data, the correct chemical formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Spectroscopic Data**\n\n*   **Core Structure:** The problem states the compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This is a benzene ring with two substituents.\n*   **FTIR Data:** An absorption peak for an ester group (-COO-) is present.\n*   **1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** There are *two signals* for the aromatic protons. In a di-substituted benzene ring, this pattern strongly suggests a **1,4- (para) substitution**. A para-substituted ring with two different substituents gives two signals (often two doublets) for the four aromatic protons due to symmetry. This gives us a `p-disubstituted C6H4` core.\n    *   **Vinyl Protons (-CH=CH-):** There are *two signals* for vinyl protons. This indicates a double bond with a hydrogen on each carbon.\n        *   Signal 1: A **doublet**. This means the corresponding proton is adjacent to (coupled with) only one other proton.\n        *   Signal 2: A **doublet of quartets (dq)**. The \"doublet\" part arises from coupling to one proton. The \"quartet\" part arises from coupling to three equivalent protons, which is characteristic of a methyl (-CH3) group.\n        *   This splitting pattern (d + dq) is a classic fingerprint for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)** attached to another group (in this case, the aromatic ring).\n            *   Let's verify: In `Ar-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3`, proton H(a) is split only by H(b), giving a doublet. Proton H(b) is split by H(a) (giving a doublet) and by the adjacent -CH3 group (giving a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. This perfectly matches the data.\n            *   So, one substituent is a propenyl group: `-CH=CH-CH3`.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-CH3):** There are *two signals* for methyl groups.\n        *   Signal 1: We have already identified one methyl group as part of the propenyl substituent (`-CH=CH-CH3`).\n        *   Signal 2: The second methyl group must be part of the other substituent, which we know is an ester. The simplest ester group containing a methyl group is a **methyl ester (-COOCH3)**. The protons of this methyl group would appear as a singlet, as they have no adjacent protons to couple with.\n    *   **Methylene Protons (-CH2-):** The spectrum shows **no signals** for -CH2- groups. This is a crucial piece of information. Our proposed substituents, propenyl (-CH=CH-CH3) and methyl ester (-COOCH3), do not contain any -CH2- groups, which is consistent with the data.\n\n**2. Assemble the Structure and Determine the Formula**\n\nBased on the analysis, we can assemble the molecule:\n*   **Core:** A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring (`C6H4`).\n*   **Substituent 1:** A propenyl group (`-C3H5`).\n*   **Substituent 2:** A methyl ester group (`-COOCH3`).\n\nThe most likely structure is **methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate**.\n\nNow, let's count the atoms to find the chemical formula:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 (in the benzene ring) + 3 (in the propenyl group) + 1 (in the carbonyl C=O) + 1 (in the methoxy -OCH3) = **11 carbons**.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (on the benzene ring) + 5 (in the propenyl group, -CH=CH-CH3) + 3 (in the methoxy -OCH3) = **12 hydrogens**.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (in the ester group, -COO-) = **2 oxygens**.\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**3. Compare with the Options**\n\nThe calculated formula C11H12O2 matches option A. Let's briefly consider why the other options are incorrect:\n*   **C11H14O2:** Has two more hydrogens. This would imply the absence of the C=C double bond in the propenyl group (i.e., it would be a propyl group, -CH2CH2CH3). This would eliminate the vinyl-H signals and introduce -CH2- signals, both of which contradict the data.\n*   **C12H14O2:** Has one more carbon and two more hydrogens. This could correspond to a structure like ethyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate. However, the ethyl group (-CH2CH3) contains a -CH2- group, which is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data.\n*   **C12H12O2:** Has one more carbon but the same number of hydrogens. This would require an additional degree of unsaturation (e.g., another double bond or ring), which is difficult to reconcile with the provided NMR data without violating the \"no -CH2-\" rule or the specific splitting patterns.\n\nThe evidence strongly and consistently points to the formula C11H12O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Spectroscopic Data to Identify Structural Fragments**\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring (C6H6 base) with two substituents, replacing two hydrogen atoms. The core formula for this part is C6H4. The presence of **two signals for aromatic-H** strongly suggests a 1,4- (para) substitution pattern. In a para-disubstituted ring with two different substituents, the chemical environments of the four protons result in two distinct signals (an AA'BB' system).\n\n*   **Ester group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an ester functional group, which has the formula -COO-. This adds one carbon and two oxygen atoms to our count.\n\n*   **Vinyl-H signals:** The spectrum shows two signals for vinyl protons (-CH=CH-).\n    *   One signal is a **doublet**, meaning this proton is coupled to only one adjacent proton.\n    *   The other signal is a **doublet of quartets**. This is a key piece of information. \"Doublet\" means it's coupled to one adjacent proton (the other vinyl proton). \"Quartet\" means it's also coupled to a group of three equivalent protons, which must be a methyl (-CH3) group.\n    *   This splitting pattern uniquely identifies a **propenyl group**: -CH=CH-CH3. The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group gives the doublet of quartets, and the other vinyl proton gives the doublet. This fragment contributes C3H5 to the formula.\n\n*   **-CH3 signals:** The spectrum shows **two signals for -CH3 groups**.\n    *   One of these methyl groups is part of the propenyl (-CH=CH-CH3) group we just identified.\n    *   The second -CH3 signal must come from the other part of the molecule. Given we have an ester group (-COO-), this second methyl group is most likely part of a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH3). This fragment contributes C1H3.\n\n*   **No -CH2 signals:** This is a crucial constraint that eliminates any structures containing methylene (-CH2-) groups.\n\n**2. Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Molecular Formula**\n\nLet's sum the atoms from the fragments we've identified:\n*   From the aromatic ring: C6H4\n*   From the ester group's carbonyl: C1O2\n*   From the propenyl group: C3H5\n*   From the second methyl group: C1H3\n\nNow, let's combine these pieces:\n*   **Total Carbons (C):** 6 (ring) + 1 (carbonyl) + 3 (propenyl) + 1 (methyl) = **11**\n*   **Total Hydrogens (H):** 4 (ring) + 5 (propenyl) + 3 (methyl) = **12**\n*   **Total Oxygens (O):** 2 (ester) = **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\nA possible structure that fits all the data is methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate. This molecule is para-substituted, has an ester, a propenyl group, a second methyl group, and no CH2 groups, perfectly matching all the spectroscopic evidence.\n\n**3. Verify with Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\nThe formula for DoU is: `DoU = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1`.\nLet's calculate the DoU for the deduced formula C11H12O2 and compare it to the structural requirements.\n*   DoU = 11 - (12/2) + 1 = 11 - 6 + 1 = **6**\n\nLet's check if our proposed structure has a DoU of 6:\n*   Benzene ring: 1 ring + 3 double bonds = 4 degrees of unsaturation.\n*   Ester C=O double bond: 1 degree of unsaturation.\n*   Vinyl C=C double bond: 1 degree of unsaturation.\n*   Total DoU = 4 + 1 + 1 = **6**.\nThe calculated DoU matches the structure, confirming our assignment.\n\n**4. Eliminate Other Options**\n\n*   **A) C12H12O2:** DoU = 12 - 12/2 + 1 = 7. This DoU is too high for the identified fragments.\n*   **C) C11H14O2:** DoU = 11 - 14/2 + 1 = 5. This DoU would mean there is no vinyl C=C double bond, which contradicts the NMR data.\n*   **D) C12H14O2:** DoU = 12 - 14/2 + 1 = 6. While the DoU is correct, getting from C11H12O2 to C12H14O2 requires adding a CH2 group. The NMR data explicitly states there are no -CH2- groups, so this option is incorrect.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the spectroscopic data, the only possible chemical formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Spectroscopic Data to Deduce Structural Fragments**\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** The presence of absorption peaks for an ester group indicates the molecule contains a `-COO-` functional group. An ester group contains one carbon and two oxygen atoms.\n\n*   **Compound Type:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This implies a benzene ring (`C6H6`) where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by two substituent groups. The core of the molecule is therefore a `C6H4` fragment.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** A di-substituted benzene ring can be ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4) substituted. A para-substituted ring is symmetrical, which would result in two distinct signals for the four aromatic protons (two sets of two equivalent protons, appearing as two doublets). This is the simplest pattern that fits the \"two signals\" description. We can assume a `p-C6H4` fragment. This fragment accounts for 6 carbons and 4 hydrogens.\n    *   **Vinyl-H (2 signals: one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This splitting pattern is highly characteristic of a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`).\n        *   Let's label the protons: `R-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3`.\n        *   Proton H(b) is adjacent to one vinyl proton H(a) (giving a doublet) and three methyl protons (giving a quartet). The combined splitting results in a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n        *   Proton H(a) is adjacent only to vinyl proton H(b). This results in a **doublet (d)**.\n        *   This confirms the presence of a `-CH=CH-CH3` fragment, which contains 3 carbons and 5 hydrogens.\n    *   **–CH₃ Groups (2 signals):**\n        *   One signal corresponds to the methyl group in the propenyl fragment (`-CH=CH-CH3`).\n        *   The second signal corresponds to another methyl group.\n    *   **No –CH₂ Groups:** The spectrum shows a complete absence of signals for methylene (`-CH2-`) groups. This is a crucial piece of information that eliminates many possible structures (e.g., those with ethyl, propyl, or allyl groups). The second methyl group must be attached to an atom with no hydrogens, such as the aromatic ring, a carbonyl carbon (`-CO-CH3`), or an ester oxygen (`-O-CH3`).\n\n**2. Assemble the Fragments into a Plausible Structure**\n\nWe have the following pieces:\n*   A para-substituted benzene ring: `p-C6H4`\n*   A propenyl group: `-CH=CH-CH3`\n*   An ester group: `-COO-`\n*   A second methyl group: `-CH3`\n\nLet's combine them. The two substituents on the benzene ring must be the propenyl group and a group containing the ester and the second methyl group. There are two primary ways to arrange this:\n\n*   **Structure 1 (Methyl ester):** The substituents are `-CH=CH-CH3` and `-COOCH3`. The full structure is methyl p-(propenyl)benzoate.\n*   **Structure 2 (Phenyl ester):** The substituents are `-CH=CH-CH3` and `-O-CO-CH3`. The full structure is p-(propenyl)phenyl acetate.\n\n**3. Determine the Chemical Formula**\n\nLet's count the atoms for either of these valid structures (they will have the same formula):\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from C₆H₄) + 3 (from -CH=CH-CH₃) + 1 (from -COO-) + 1 (from the second -CH₃) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from C₆H₄) + 5 (from -CH=CH-CH₃) + 3 (from the second -CH₃) = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from -COO-) = **2**\n\nThe chemical formula derived from the spectroscopic data is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n**4. Compare with Options and Use Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\nThe derived formula, C₁₁H₁₂O₂, matches option A. Let's use the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to verify our choice and eliminate other options.\n\nThe DoU for a formula `CxHyOz` is `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n*   Our proposed structure has a benzene ring (DoU=4), a C=C double bond (DoU=1), and a C=O double bond (DoU=1). Total DoU = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for the given options:\n*   A) **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**. (Matches)\n*   B) **C₁₂H₁₄O₂**: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 13 - 7 = **6**. (Matches)\n*   C) **C₁₁H₁₄O₂**: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 12 - 7 = 5. (Incorrect DoU, eliminated)\n*   D) **C₁₂H₁₂O₂**: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 13 - 6 = 7. (Incorrect DoU, eliminated)\n\nWe are left with options A (C₁₁H₁₂O₂) and B (C₁₂H₁₄O₂). The difference between these two formulas is one carbon and two hydrogens (`CH₂`). However, the problem explicitly states there are **no signals for –CH₂ groups**. Therefore, the correct formula cannot be C₁₂H₁₄O₂, as it would require adding a CH₂ unit to the structure we logically deduced (C₁₁H₁₂O₂).\n\nThe only formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Spectroscopic Data**\n\n*   **Compound Type:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we have a benzene ring with two substituents, and four hydrogens on the ring itself. The core of the molecule is C6H4.\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** Shows an absorption peak for an ester group (-COO-). This means the molecule contains two oxygen atoms, a carbonyl group (C=O), and an ether-like linkage.\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Six signals:** This indicates there are six chemically non-equivalent sets of protons in the molecule.\n    *   **Two aromatic-H signals:** For a di-substituted benzene ring, having two signals for the four aromatic protons is characteristic of a para (1,4) substitution pattern, especially with electronically different substituents.\n    *   **Two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This is a very informative splitting pattern. A vinyl group has protons on a C=C double bond.\n        *   A proton that is a **doublet of quartets** is split by two different neighbors: one proton (giving the doublet) and a set of three equivalent protons (giving the quartet). The set of three protons is a methyl (-CH3) group.\n        *   A proton that is a **doublet** is split by one neighboring proton.\n        *   This pattern perfectly describes a propenyl group: **-CH=CH-CH3**. Let's call the protons Ar-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3. H(b) is split by H(a) and the -CH3 group, making it a doublet of quartets. H(a) is split only by H(b), making it a doublet. This fragment has the formula **C3H5**.\n    *   **Two -CH3 group signals:** The molecule has two methyl groups that are in different chemical environments. We have already identified one in the propenyl group (-CH=CH-**CH3**). The second one must be part of the ester group.\n    *   **No -CH2- group signals:** This is a crucial constraint. The structure cannot contain any methylene (-CH2-) groups.\n\n**2. Assemble the Molecular Fragments**\n\nBased on the analysis, we can identify the following pieces of the molecule:\n\n*   **Fragment 1:** A di-substituted benzene ring (**C6H4**).\n*   **Fragment 2:** A propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3), which has the formula **C3H5**. This fragment accounts for the two vinyl-H signals and one of the -CH3 signals. It contains no -CH2- groups.\n*   **Fragment 3:** An ester group that contains the second -CH3 group and has no -CH2- groups. The two simplest possibilities are:\n    *   A methyl ester group: -COOCH3.\n    *   An acetoxy group: -O-CO-CH3.\n    Both of these fragments have the same atomic composition: **C2H3O2**.\n\n**3. Determine the Molecular Formula**\n\nNow, we sum the atoms from all the fragments to find the total molecular formula:\n\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5) + 2 (from C2H3O2) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from C3H5) + 3 (from C2H3O2) = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from C2H3O2) = **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**4. Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)**\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) tells us the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n\n*   **From the structure:**\n    *   Benzene ring = 4 (1 for the ring + 3 for the double bonds)\n    *   Ester C=O group = 1\n    *   Vinyl C=C group = 1\n    *   **Total DBE = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6**\n\n*   **From the derived formula (C11H12O2):**\n    *   DBE = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1\n    *   DBE = 11 - 12/2 + 0/2 + 1 = 11 - 6 + 1 = **6**\n\nThe DBE calculated from the structure matches the DBE calculated from the formula C11H12O2, confirming our result.\n\n**5. Evaluate Other Options**\n\n*   **A) C11H14O2:** DBE = 11 - 14/2 + 1 = 5. This does not match the required DBE of 6.\n*   **C) C12H12O2:** DBE = 12 - 12/2 + 1 = 7. This does not match the required DBE of 6.\n*   **D) C12H14O2:** DBE = 12 - 14/2 + 1 = 6. This DBE matches, but to get this formula from our structure (C11H12O2), we would need to add a 'CH2' unit. The problem explicitly states there are no -CH2- groups, ruling out this option.\n\nConclusion: The only formula that is fully consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the structural information from the problem description:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring with two groups attached, having a base formula of C6H4.\n    *   **FTIR shows an ester group:** This confirms the presence of a -COO- functional group, which contains two oxygen atoms. All the given options (C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2) have two oxygen atoms, consistent with this information.\n    *   **1H NMR data:** This is the most crucial part for determining the structure.\n        *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring with two aromatic proton signals strongly suggests a para (1,4) substitution pattern due to the molecule's symmetry. Ortho and meta substitution would typically result in more complex patterns with more than two signals.\n        *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a key constraint. It means there are no methylene groups in the molecule.\n        *   **Two signals for -CH3 groups:** There are two distinct methyl groups in different chemical environments.\n        *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets):** This splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`).\n            *   Let's denote the group as `Ar-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3`.\n            *   The proton H(b) is coupled to one adjacent proton H(a) (giving a doublet) and three protons of the methyl group (giving a quartet). Thus, its signal would be a **doublet of quartets**. This matches the description.\n            *   The proton H(a) is coupled only to the adjacent proton H(b). Thus, its signal would be a **doublet**. This also matches the description.\n            *   One of the two required -CH3 signals comes from this propenyl group.\n\n2.  **Assemble the molecular fragments:**\n    *   We have a para-substituted benzene ring (`-C6H4-`).\n    *   We have a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`). This is one of the substituents. It also accounts for one of the two methyl signals.\n    *   We have an ester group (`-COO-`).\n    *   We need one more methyl group (`-CH3`) to account for the second methyl signal. This methyl group must be part of the ester to satisfy the valence of all atoms.\n\n3.  **Construct the possible structures and determine the formula:**\n    There are two ways to incorporate the ester group, the propenyl group, and the second methyl group onto the para-substituted benzene ring:\n\n    *   **Case A: The benzene ring is part of the acid component of the ester.**\n        The structure is: `CH3-CH=CH` - `C6H4` - `COOCH3`. (Methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate)\n        Let's sum the atoms:\n        *   Carbon (C): 3 (from propenyl) + 6 (from benzene ring) + 1 (from carboxyl) + 1 (from methyl ester) = 11 carbons.\n        *   Hydrogen (H): 5 (from propenyl) + 4 (from benzene ring) + 3 (from methyl ester) = 12 hydrogens.\n        *   Oxygen (O): 2 (from ester).\n        *   The resulting formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n    *   **Case B: The benzene ring is part of the alcohol component of the ester.**\n        The structure is: `CH3` - `COO` - `C6H4` - `CH=CH-CH3`.

The DBE matches.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the other options:**\n    *   **A) C11H14O2:** DBE = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 5. This DBE is too low to accommodate a benzene ring (DBE=4), an ester C=O (DBE=1), and a vinyl C=C (DBE=1).\n    *   **B) C12H12O2:** DBE = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7. This implies an extra degree of unsaturation compared to our structure (DBE=6), which is not suggested by the simple NMR data.\n    *   **D) C12H14O2:** DBE = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 6. This DBE is consistent with the structural features. However, to get this formula from our core fragments (`p-C6H4`, `ester`, `propenyl`), we would need to add a CH2 unit (C11H12O2 + CH2 = C12H14O2). But the NMR data explicitly states there are **no -CH2- groups**. Therefore, this formula is incorrect.\n\nBased on the thorough analysis of the provided spectroscopic data, the only possible chemical formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the structural information from the problem description.**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This implies a benzene ring with two substituents, which has the formula C6H4. The four protons on the ring account for the aromatic signals.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum ... shows ... an ester group\"**: This means the molecule contains a -COO- functional group. This group has two oxygen atoms.\n    *   **\"1H NMR spectrum shows six signals\"**: This tells us there are six chemically non-equivalent sets of protons in the molecule.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the 1H NMR data to identify molecular fragments.**\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\"**: This is consistent with the C6H4 group.

This accounts for **4 hydrogens**.\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\"**: Vinyl protons are hydrogens attached to a C=C double bond. This specific splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group, **-CH=CH-CH3**.\n        *   Let's denote it as -CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3.\n        *   H(a) is split only by H(b), so it appears as a **doublet**.\n        *   H(b) is split by H(a) (a doublet) and by the three protons of the -CH3 group (a quartet), resulting in a **doublet of quartets**.\n        *   This fragment accounts for two vinyl hydrogens and one methyl group.\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups\"**: We have already identified one -CH3 group as part of the propenyl fragment. The second -CH3 group must be part of the ester functionality. The two possibilities for an ester group containing a methyl group are a methyl ester (**-COOCH3**) or an acetate ester (**-O-CO-CH3**). Both possibilities add one methyl group to the structure.\n    *   **\"no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups\"**: This is a crucial constraint that helps eliminate other possible structures. For example, we can rule out ethyl esters (-COOCH2CH3), propyl groups (-CH2CH2CH3), or allyl groups (-CH2-CH=CH2).\n\n3.  **Assemble the fragments to build the complete molecule and determine its formula.**\n    *   We have the following pieces:\n        *   A C6H4 aromatic ring.\n        *   A -CH=CH-CH3 (propenyl) group.\n        *   An ester group containing a methyl group (either -COOCH3 or -O-CO-CH3).\n\n    *   Let's assemble these pieces.

The other options are inconsistent with the spectroscopic data. For instance, C11H14O2 would likely lack the vinyl C=C bond, and formulas with 12 carbons or 14 hydrogens would either violate the \"no -CH2-\" rule or contradict the NMR splitting patterns described.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct chemical formula:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Spectroscopic Data to Identify Fragments\n\nFirst, let's break down the information provided by the FTIR and 1H NMR spectra to identify the key structural components of the molecule.\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates the presence of a benzene ring with two substituents. The core of this fragment is `C6H4`. The four protons on this ring will appear in the aromatic region of the 1H NMR spectrum. The presence of two distinct signals for these protons is common for para- or meta-substituted rings.\n*   **FTIR shows an ester group:** This confirms the presence of a `-COO-` functional group.\n*   **1H NMR Signal Analysis:**\n    *   **Vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This is a very specific splitting pattern. A vinyl proton that is a doublet of quartets is coupled to another vinyl proton (giving the doublet) and a methyl group (giving the quartet). This strongly suggests a propenyl group, `-CH=CH-CH3`.\n        *   The proton adjacent to the `-CH3` group is split by the other vinyl proton and the three methyl protons, resulting in a doublet of quartets.\n        *   The other vinyl proton is split only by the first vinyl proton, resulting in a doublet.\n    *   **Two -CH3 signals:** One of these methyl groups is part of the propenyl (`-CH=CH-CH3`) fragment we just identified. The second `-CH3` signal must come from another methyl group elsewhere in the molecule, likely part of the ester (e.g., a methyl ester, `-COOCH3`) or attached to the aromatic ring.\n    *   **No -CH2 groups:** This is a crucial constraint that eliminates many possibilities.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (also called the index of hydrogen deficiency) tells us the total number of rings and pi bonds in the molecule. Let's calculate the DBE from the identified fragments:\n\n*   Aromatic ring: 1 ring + 3 double bonds = 4 DBE\n*   Ester group (C=O): 1 double bond = 1 DBE\n*   Vinyl group (C=C): 1 double bond = 1 DBE\n*   **Total required DBE = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6**\n\nNow, let's calculate the DBE for each of the proposed chemical formulas using the formula: `DBE = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **A) C11H14O2:** DBE = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 12 - 7 = 5. This is inconsistent with the required DBE of 6.\n*   **B) C12H12O2:** DBE = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 13 - 6 = 7. This is inconsistent with the required DBE of 6.\n*   **C) C12H14O2:** DBE = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 13 - 7 = 6. This is consistent with the required DBE of 6.\n*   **D) C11H12O2:** DBE = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6. This is consistent with the required DBE of 6.\n\nThis analysis eliminates options A and B, leaving C and D as possibilities.\n\n### 3. Assemble the Fragments and Apply Constraints\n\nNow we must decide between `C12H14O2` and `C11H12O2`. Let's assemble the fragments we identified in step 1 and count the atoms.\n\n*   Aromatic ring fragment: `C6H4`\n*   Ester fragment: `CO2`\n*   Propenyl fragment: `C3H5` (from `-CH=CH-CH3`)\n*   Second methyl fragment: `CH3`\n\nSumming the atoms from these fragments gives:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 11\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2\n\nThe formula derived from assembling all the required pieces is **`C11H12O2`**. This matches option D.\n\nLet's check why `C12H14O2` (Option C) is incorrect, even though its DBE is correct.\n*   The formula `C12H14O2` contains one extra carbon and two extra hydrogens (`CH2`) compared to the `C11H12O2` formula we derived.\n*   To incorporate a `CH2` unit into any of the plausible structures for `C11H12O2` (like methyl p-propenylbenzoate, `CH3-CH=CH-C6H4-COOCH3`), one would have to do something like:\n    *   Change a methyl group to an ethyl group (e.g., `-COOCH3` -> `-COOCH2CH3`).\n    *   Insert a methylene bridge (e.g., `-C6H4-` -> `-CH2-C6H4-`).\n*   In all such cases, a `-CH2-` group is introduced into the molecule.\n*   The 1H NMR data explicitly states there are **no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups**.\n*   Therefore, the formula `C12H14O2` is inconsistent with the NMR data.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOnly the formula `C11H12O2` is fully consistent with all the information provided: the presence of a di-substituted aromatic ring, an ester group, a propenyl group, a second methyl group, a total of six NMR signals, and the absence of any `-CH2-` groups.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Spectroscopic Data**\n\n*   **Compound Type:** The problem states we have a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This is a benzene ring with two substituents.\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** An absorption peak for an ester group (-COO-) is present.\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:** This provides the most detailed structural information.\n    *   **Six signals total:** This is the total number of distinct proton environments in the molecule.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons (C₆H₄). For these 4 protons to give only two signals, there must be symmetry. This strongly indicates a **para (1,4) substitution pattern**, where protons opposite each other are equivalent.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H:** Vinyl protons are attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n        *   One signal is a **doublet (d)**. This means it's coupled to only one adjacent proton.\n        *   The other is a **doublet of quartets (dq)**. This means it's coupled to one adjacent proton (giving the doublet splitting) and a group of three equivalent protons (giving the quartet splitting). A group of three equivalent protons is a methyl (-CH₃) group.\n        *   This splitting pattern (d and dq) is characteristic of a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**.\n            *   `Ar-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH₃`\n            *   H(a) is split by H(b) into a doublet.\n            *   H(b) is split by H(a) into a doublet, and by the -CH₃ group into a quartet, resulting in a doublet of quartets. This perfectly matches the data.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH₃ groups:**\n        *   One -CH₃ signal belongs to the propenyl group we just identified.\n        *   The second -CH₃ signal must belong to the ester group.\n    *   **No signals for –CH₂ groups:** This is a crucial constraint. It eliminates possibilities like an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) or other longer alkyl chains.\n\n**2. Piece Together the Molecular Structure**\n\nBased on the analysis, we can assemble the molecule's components:\n\n*   A **para-substituted benzene ring** (C₆H₄).\n*   **Substituent 1:** A **propenyl group** (-CH=CH-CH₃). This accounts for one of the -CH₃ signals and the two vinyl-H signals. Its formula fragment is C₃H₅.\n*   **Substituent 2:** An **ester group** that contains the second -CH₃ signal but no -CH₂ group. There are two main possibilities:\n    1.  A **methyl ester group** attached to the ring: `-COOCH₃`.\n    2.  An **acetoxy group** attached to the ring: `-O-CO-CH₃`.\n\nBoth of these ester fragments contain one methyl group and no methylene group, fitting the data.\n\n**3. Determine the Molecular Formula**\n\nNow, let's calculate the total molecular formula by summing the atoms from the core and the substituents. We can use either of the two possible structures derived in the previous step, as they will be isomers and have the same formula.\n\n*   **Core:** para-substituted benzene ring → `C₆H₄`\n*   **Substituent 1:** propenyl group → `C₃H₅`\n*   **Substituent 2:** ester fragment with one methyl group (e.g., `-COOCH₃` or `-O-CO-CH₃`) → `C₂H₃O₂`\n\n**Total Formula Calculation:**\n\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from ester) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from ester's methyl) = **12**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from ester) = **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n**4. Verify with the Options**\n\nLet's check this result against the given choices:\nA) C₁₁H₁₄O₂\nB) C₁₂H₁₄O₂\nC) C₁₂H₁₂O₂\nD) C₁₁H₁₂O₂\n\nOur calculated formula, C₁₁H₁₂O₂, matches option D.\n\n**Verification using Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n\nThe DBE for a formula CₐHₙOₙ is calculated as `DBE = a - b/2 + 1`.\n*   For our deduced structure: 1 aromatic ring (4 DBE) + 1 C=C double bond (1 DBE) + 1 C=O double bond (1 DBE) = **6 DBE**.\n*   For the formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂: `DBE = 11 - 12/2 + 1 = 11 - 6 + 1 = 6`.\nThe DBE matches, confirming our structural analysis and the resulting formula are consistent. The other options either have the wrong DBE (A and C) or cannot be reconciled with the NMR data without violating the given constraints (B).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound from the given spectroscopic data.\n\n**1. Analyze the Spectroscopic Information**\n\n*   **Compound Type:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This tells us the core structure is a benzene ring with two substituents, which can be represented as a C6H4 group.\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** Shows an ester group (-COO-). This accounts for the two oxygen atoms in all the proposed formulas. An ester group also contains a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum Breakdown:**\n    *   **No –CH2 groups:** This is a crucial constraint. It rules out groups like ethyl (-CH2CH3), propyl (-CH2CH2CH3), etc.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons (C6**H4**). Two signals for these 4 protons typically indicate a para-substitution pattern with two different substituents, resulting in two doublets (an AA'BB' system). This fragment accounts for **C6** and **H4**.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This is a classic pattern for a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`).\n        *   Let's label the protons: `(A)H-C=C(B)-CH3`.\n        *   Proton (A) is adjacent to only proton (B), so its signal would be a **doublet (d)**.\n        *   Proton (B) is adjacent to proton (A) (1H) and the methyl group (3H). According to the n+1 rule, it will be split into a doublet by proton (A) and a quartet by the -CH3 group. This results in a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n        *   This fragment is `-CH=CH-CH3` and accounts for **C3** and **H5** (1 vinyl-H + 1 vinyl-H + 3 methyl-H).\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:**\n        *   One of these signals corresponds to the methyl group in the propenyl fragment (`-CH=CH-CH3`). This would be a doublet due to coupling with the adjacent vinyl proton.\n        *   The second -CH3 signal must come from the other part of the molecule. Since there are no -CH2- groups, this methyl group is likely part of the ester, forming a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate group (`-O-CO-CH3`). In either case, this fragment adds a **-CH3** group, accounting for **H3**.\n\n**2. Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Formula**\n\nLet's sum up the atoms from the fragments we have deduced:\n\n*   **From the aromatic ring:** C6H4\n*   **From the vinyl and first methyl groups:** A propenyl group, `-CH=CH-CH3`. This has C3H5.\n*   **From the ester and the second methyl group:** We need an ester (`-COO-`) and a methyl group (`-CH3`). The most logical combinations that don't introduce a CH2 group are a methyl carboxylate (`-COOCH3`) or an acetoxy group (`-O-CO-CH3`).\n    *   If the substituent is `-COOCH3`, it contributes C2H3O2.\n    *   If the substituent is `-O-CO-CH3`, it contributes C2H3O2.\n\nLet's build a complete molecule. The two substituents on the C6H4 ring must be the propenyl group and the ester-containing group.\n\n*   **Structure 1:** `(propenyl group)`-C6H4-`(methyl carboxylate group)` -> `CH3-CH=CH-C6H4-COOCH3`\n*   **Structure 2:** `(propenyl group)`-C6H4-`(acetoxy group)` -> `CH3-CH=CH-C6H4-O-CO-CH3`\n\nNow, let's calculate the total molecular formula for either of these possible structures:\n\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5 propenyl) + 2 (from C2H3O2 ester/acetate part) = **11 carbons**.\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from C3H5 propenyl) + 3 (from C2H3O2 ester/acetate part) = **12 hydrogens**.\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group) = **2 oxygens**.\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**3. Compare with the Options**\n\nThe calculated formula is C11H12O2. Let's compare this with the given choices:\nA) C12H14O2\nB) C12H12O2\nC) C11H12O2\nD) C11H14O2\n\nOur derived formula matches option C.\n\nTo be certain, we can quickly re-check the hydrogen and carbon counts from the NMR data alone:\n*   **Total Hydrogens:** 4 (aromatic) + 2 (vinyl) + 3 (methyl 1) + 3 (methyl 2) = 12 H. This eliminates options A (14 H) and D (14 H).\n*   **Total Carbons:** 6 (aromatic ring) + 2 (vinyl C=C) + 1 (methyl C) + 1 (second methyl C) + 1 (ester C=O) = 11 C. This eliminates option B (12 C).\n\nBoth methods of analysis consistently lead to the same formula.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Provided Spectroscopic Data**\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** Indicates the presence of an ester group (-COO-). An ester group contains one carbonyl (C=O) and one C-O bond. It has a molecular formula fragment of -CO2-.\n*   **General Structure:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we have a benzene ring with two other groups attached to it. The core of this ring is C6H4.\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **Six signals total:** This indicates six chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4) has 4 aromatic protons. The fact that they appear as two signals suggests a substitution pattern like ortho (1,2-disubstituted) or para (1,4-disubstituted). In either case, we have a C6H4 group.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This is a classic and very informative splitting pattern. It strongly suggests the presence of a propenyl group, specifically `-CH=CH-CH3`.\n        *   Let's label the protons: -CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3.\n        *   Proton H(b) is split by the adjacent H(a) (giving a doublet) and the three protons of the -CH3 group (giving a quartet). The combination results in a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n        *   Proton H(a) is split only by the adjacent H(b), resulting in a **doublet (d)**.\n        *   This confirms the presence of a `-CH=CH-CH3` fragment, which has a formula of C3H5.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:** One of these methyl signals belongs to the `-CH=CH-CH3` group we just identified. Therefore, there must be a second, distinct `-CH3` group elsewhere in the molecule.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a crucial piece of negative evidence. The final structure cannot contain any methylene (-CH2-) groups.\n\n**2. Assemble the Molecular Fragments**\n\nBased on the analysis above, we have the following pieces of the molecule:\n*   A di-substituted benzene ring: `C6H4`\n*   An ester group: `-COO-`\n*   A propenyl group: `-CH=CH-CH3`\n*   A methyl group: `-CH3`\n\nNow, we must assemble these fragments into a valid chemical structure that is consistent with all the data. The ester group must link two parts of the molecule. There are two primary ways the benzene ring can be part of an ester:\n\n*   **Case A: Methyl Benzoate derivative:** The ring is attached to the carbonyl part of the ester (`C6H4-COO-R`). The two substituents on the ring would be the propenyl group and the ester group itself. R would be the remaining fragment, which is a methyl group (`-CH3`). However, the NMR specifies *two* -CH3 signals, one from the propenyl group and one other. This would only provide one -CH3 signal from the propenyl group and one from the ester's methyl group, which seems to fit. Let's reconsider. The question says there are two signals corresponding to `-CH3` groups. Our fragments are C6H4, COO, -CH=CH-CH3, and -CH3. It seems more likely the two substituents on the ring are -CH3 and something else.\n\nLet's try a different assembly. The two substituents on the C6H4 ring are a methyl group (`-CH3`) and the ester group.\n\n*   **Structure Possibility 1: Propenyl methylbenzoate**\n    *   Let's place the `-CH3` group and the ester group onto the benzene ring. This gives a `CH3-C6H4-COO-` fragment.\n    *   The remaining fragment is the propenyl group, `-CH=CH-CH3`. This group must be attached to the oxygen of the ester.\n    *   The resulting structure is: `CH3-C6H4-COO-CH=CH-CH3`.\n    *   This structure fits all the NMR data: two aromatic signals (possible for ortho/para), vinyl signals for `-O-CH=CH-CH3`, two distinct -CH3 signals (one on the ring, one on the vinyl group), and no -CH2 groups.\n\n*   **Structure Possibility 2: Methyl propenylbenzoate**\n    *   Let's place the `-CH=CH-CH3` group and the ester group onto the ring. This gives a `(CH3-CH=CH)-C6H4-COO-` fragment.\n    *   The remaining fragment is the methyl group, `-CH3`. This must be attached to the ester oxygen.\n    *   The resulting structure is: `(CH3-CH=CH)-C6H4-COOCH3`.\n    *   This structure also fits all the NMR data: two aromatic signals, vinyl signals for `Ar-CH=CH-CH3`, two distinct -CH3 signals (one on the vinyl group, one from the methyl ester), and no -CH2 groups.\n\n**3. Calculate the Chemical Formula**\n\nBoth plausible structures are isomers and should have the same chemical formula. Let's calculate it for the first structure (`CH3-C6H4-COO-CH=CH-CH3`):\n*   **Carbons (C):** 1 (from methyl on ring) + 6 (from ring) + 1 (from ester C=O) + 3 (from propenyl group) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 3 (from methyl on ring) + 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl group) = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from ester group) = **2**\n\nThe chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\n*   **A) C11H12O2:** This matches our derived formula.\n*   **B) C12H12O2:** This would require adding a carbon atom without changing the hydrogen count, which is not possible with simple organic groups. It would disrupt the structure that fits the NMR data.\n*   **C) C12H14O2:** To get this formula from C11H12O2, one must add a `CH2` group. The problem statement explicitly says there are no signals for `-CH2` groups. This option is incorrect.\n*   **D) C11H14O2:** This formula has two more hydrogens than our derived structure. To add two hydrogens, we would need to remove a double bond. However, the NMR data clearly shows a `C=C` double bond (vinyl protons). This option contradicts the NMR data.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that perfectly aligns with all the provided spectroscopic evidence is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Framework:**\n    *   The compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This means we start with a benzene ring that has two hydrogen atoms replaced by other groups. The core formula for this part is C6H4.\n    *   The aromatic nature implies 4 degrees of unsaturation (1 for the ring, 3 for the double bonds).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Functional Groups from FTIR and NMR:**\n    *   **FTIR:** An \"ester group\" is present. An ester has the structure R-COO-R', which contains a carbonyl group (C=O). This accounts for one more degree of unsaturation.\n    *   **1H NMR - No -CH2 groups:** This is a crucial constraint that eliminates many possibilities. For example, we cannot have ethyl, propyl, or butyl groups in their standard forms.\n\n3.  **Deconstruct the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons. Having only two signals for these 4 protons suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely 1,4-disubstitution (para). This confirms the C6H4 part. Total protons so far: 4.\n    *   **Vinyl-H (2 signals: one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) attached to the aromatic ring. Let's analyze the coupling:\n        *   Structure: `Ar-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3`\n        *   The proton `H(a)` is adjacent to `H(b)`, so its signal is split into a **doublet**.\n        *   The proton `H(b)` is adjacent to `H(a)` (causing a doublet split) and also to the three protons of the methyl group (causing a quartet split). The resulting signal is a **doublet of quartets**.\n        *   This confirms the presence of a propenyl group, -C3H5. This group adds 1 degree of unsaturation (the C=C double bond). Total protons from this group: 1+1+3 = 5.\n    *   **-CH3 groups (2 signals):** The NMR spectrum shows two distinct methyl group signals.\n        *   One methyl signal belongs to the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) we just identified.\n        *   The second methyl signal must come from the ester group. Since there are no -CH2- groups, the ester must be either a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate ester (-O-CO-CH3).\n\n4.  **Assemble the Molecular Fragments and Determine the Formula:**\n    Let's assemble the identified parts to build the whole molecule.\n    *   **Fragment 1:** The di-substituted aromatic ring: **C6H4**.\n    *   **Fragment 2:** The propenyl group: **-C3H5**.\n    *   **Fragment 3:** The ester group part containing the second methyl group.\n        *   If it's a methyl ester group attached to the ring: -COOCH3. The formula for this fragment is **-C2H3O2**.\n        *   If it's an acetate group attached to the ring: -O-CO-CH3. The formula for this fragment is also **-C2H3O2**.\n    *   Both possibilities for the ester group fragment have the same formula.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Chemical Formula:**\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from ester part) = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from ester part) = **12**\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from ester part) = **2**\n\n    The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n6.  **Verify the Formula:**\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    *   Let's check if our proposed structure has 6 DoU: 4 (benzene ring) + 1 (propenyl C=C) + 1 (ester C=O) = 6. The DoU matches.\n    *   The formula C11H12O2 corresponds to option C. Other options like C12H14O2 or C11H14O2 would imply the presence of CH2 groups or a different degree of unsaturation, which contradicts the given data. C12H12O2 was shown in the thought process to be inconsistent with the number of vinyl signals.\n\nBased on this detailed analysis of the spectroscopic data, the correct chemical formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct chemical formula.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data:**\n\n    *   **FTIR:** The presence of an ester group is confirmed. An ester functional group contains the structure R-COO-R' and has two oxygen atoms. This means the molecular formula must end in O2. All four options (C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2) satisfy this condition.\n\n    *   **Molecular Structure Core:** The compound is described as a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This implies a benzene ring with two hydrogen atoms replaced by substituents. The core formula of this part of the molecule is C6H4.\n\n    *   **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n        *   **No –CH2 groups:** This is a critical piece of information. It means we can eliminate any proposed structure that contains a methylene (-CH2-) group. This rules out substituents like ethyl (-CH2CH3), propyl (-CH2CH2CH3), or allyl (-CH2CH=CH2).\n        *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:** The compound has two distinct types of methyl groups.\n        *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This pattern is highly characteristic of a propenyl group, specifically `–CH=CH–CH3`.\n            *   The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (creating a quartet). This results in a **doublet of quartets**.\n            *   The other vinyl proton is only split by the first vinyl proton, resulting in a **doublet**.\n            *   This group contributes `C3H5` to the formula and accounts for one of the two –CH3 signals.\n        *   **Putting it together:** Since one –CH3 signal comes from the propenyl group, the second –CH3 signal must belong to the ester. Given the \"no –CH2\" rule, the ester must be a methyl ester (`–COOCH3`), not an ethyl or larger ester. This group contributes `CO2CH3` to the formula.\n        *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4) with two different substituents in a para (1,4) arrangement would give two signals (two doublets), consistent with this description.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Deduced Structure:**\n\n    We have the following components:\n    *   A benzene ring core: `C6H4`\n    *   A propenyl group substituent: `–C3H5`\n    *   A methyl ester substituent: `–COOCH3`\n\n    Combining these parts gives the molecule methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Molecular Formula:**\n\n    Let's sum the atoms from the assembled structure:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5) + 1 (from –CO–) + 1 (from –OCH3) = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from C3H5) + 3 (from –OCH3) = **12**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from the ester group) = **2**\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n\n    The DBE (or index of hydrogen deficiency) can be used as a check.\n    *   **From spectral data:** Aromatic ring (1 ring + 3 double bonds) = 4 DBE. Ester C=O group = 1 DBE. Vinyl C=C group = 1 DBE. Total required DBE = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n    *   **From the derived formula (C11H12O2):** DBE = C + 1 - H/2 = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    The DBE calculation is consistent.\n\n5.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n\n    *   A) C12H14O2 (DBE = 12 + 1 - 14/2 = 6)\n    *   B) C11H12O2 (DBE = 11 + 1 - 12/2 = 6)\n    *   C) C12H12O2 (DBE = 12 + 1 - 12/2 = 7)\n    *   D) C11H14O2 (DBE = 11 + 1 - 14/2 = 5)\n\n    *   Option D is incorrect because its DBE of 5 is too low to accommodate an aromatic ring, an ester, and a vinyl group.\n    *   Option C is incorrect because its DBE of 7 implies an extra ring or double bond for which there is no evidence in the NMR data.\n    *   This leaves options A and B. To get from B (C11H12O2) to A (C12H14O2), one must add a `CH2` unit. As established from the NMR data, the molecule contains no `–CH2–` groups. Therefore, option A is impossible.\n\n    The only formula that perfectly matches all the spectroscopic evidence is **C11H12O2**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nThis problem requires identifying the correct chemical formula for a di-substituted aromatic compound based on its FTIR and 1H NMR spectral data. Let's break down the information provided step-by-step to deduce the structure and its formula.\n\n1.  **Analyze the given spectral data:**\n    *   **Core Structure:** A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This is a benzene ring with two substituents, which means the core has the formula -C6H4-. A benzene ring contributes 4 units to the degree of unsaturation (DoU) (one for the ring itself and three for the double bonds).\n    *   **FTIR Spectrum:** Shows absorption peaks for an ester group. An ester functional group contains a carbonyl (C=O) and a C-O single bond. The carbonyl group contributes 1 unit to the DoU. So far, the required DoU is 4 (ring) + 1 (ester C=O) = 5.\n    *   **1H NMR Spectrum - Six Signals:**\n        *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** In a di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4), there are 4 aromatic protons. Having only two signals implies symmetry. This pattern is characteristic of a para (1,4)-substituted benzene ring, where the two protons ortho to one substituent are equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the other substituent are equivalent, giving rise to two signals (often two doublets).\n        *   **Two signals for vinyl-H:** These are protons attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). This C=C bond adds another unit to the DoU, bringing the total to 6.\n            *   Signal 1: A doublet. This indicates the proton is coupled to only one other proton.\n            *   Signal 2: A doublet of quartets. This indicates the proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons: one proton (giving the doublet) and a set of three equivalent protons (a -CH3 group, giving the quartet).\n            *   This splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)** attached to another group (in this case, the aromatic ring). Let's call the ring `Ar`. In the structure `Ar-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3`, H(a) is split by H(b) into a doublet. H(b) is split by H(a) into a doublet, and this doublet is further split by the -CH3 group into quartets, resulting in a doublet of quartets. This fragment accounts for one C=C double bond, two vinyl protons, and one -CH3 group. The formula of this fragment is **-C3H5**.\n        *   **Two signals for -CH3 groups:** One -CH3 signal comes from the propenyl group described above. The other -CH3 signal must belong to the ester functionality.\n        *   **No signals for -CH2 groups:** This is a critical piece of information that restricts the possible structures.\n\n2.  **Assemble the molecular structure and determine the formula:**\n    *   We have the para-substituted benzene ring core: **C6H4**.\n    *   We have the propenyl substituent: **-C3H5**.\n    *   We have an ester group (-COO-) and the second methyl group (-CH3). The absence of -CH2- signals means the methyl group must be directly attached to the carbonyl (acetate ester, Ar-O-CO-CH3) or the ester oxygen (methyl ester, Ar-COOCH3). Both possibilities lead to the same fragment count. Let's assume a methyl ester substituent: **-COOCH3**. This fragment has the formula **-C2H3O2**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the total molecular formula:**\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5) + 2 (from C2H3O2) = 11\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from C3H5) + 3 (from C2H3O2) = 12\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from C2H3O2)\n    *   The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Verify the result against the given options:**\n    *   The derived formula C11H12O2 matches option A.\n    *   Let's check the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for C11H12O2. DoU = C + 1 - H/2 = 11 + 1 - 12/2 = 12 - 6 = 6. This matches our structural analysis: 4 (benzene ring) + 1 (C=C in propenyl) + 1 (C=O in ester) = 6.\n    *   Now, let's briefly consider the other options:\n        *   B) C11H14O2: DoU = 5. This would mean no C=C double bond in the side chain, which contradicts the vinyl-H signals.\n        *   C) C12H12O2: DoU = 7. This requires an additional double bond or ring, for which there is no evidence.\n        *   D) C12H14O2: DoU = 6. This formula has the same DoU as option A, but differs by a CH2 unit. Since the NMR data explicitly states there are no -CH2- groups, this option is ruled out.\n\nThe only formula that is fully consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Structural Information from the Problem Statement**\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This tells us the core of the molecule is a benzene ring with two substituents, meaning four hydrogen atoms are attached to the ring. This corresponds to a C6H4 fragment.\n*   **FTIR shows an ester group:** The molecule contains a -COO- functional group. This group includes a carbonyl (C=O) bond.\n*   **1H NMR Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   **Six signals total:** This indicates six distinct types of protons in the molecule.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** For a di-substituted benzene ring, having only two signals for the four aromatic protons strongly suggests a para (1,4) substitution pattern. In a para-substituted ring (G1-C6H4-G2 where G1 ≠ G2), the protons ortho to G1 are equivalent, and the protons ortho to G2 are equivalent, leading to two distinct signals (typically two doublets).\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** Vinyl protons are attached to a C=C double bond. This splitting pattern is highly characteristic of a propenyl group fragment, `-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3`.\n        *   Proton H(a) is coupled only to H(b), resulting in a doublet.\n        *   Proton H(b) is coupled to H(a) (giving a doublet) and the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (giving a quartet). The combination results in a doublet of quartets.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:**\n        *   One methyl group is identified as part of the propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`).\n        *   The second methyl signal must belong to the ester group.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a critical piece of information that eliminates many possibilities, such as an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) or an ethyl substituent on the ring.\n\n**2. Assemble the Molecular Fragments**\n\nBased on the analysis above, we can identify the following building blocks of the molecule:\n*   A para-substituted benzene ring: **C6H4**\n*   A propenyl group: **-CH=CH-CH3**\n*   An ester group that contains a methyl group but no methylene group. The two possibilities are a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH3).\n\nLet's assemble these pieces. The two substituents on the C6H4 ring are the propenyl group and the ester-containing group.\n\n*   **Substituent 1:** Propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`). Its contribution to the formula is C3H5.\n*   **Substituent 2:** This must be the ester part containing the second methyl group.\n    *   Case A: The ring is attached to the carbonyl carbon, forming a methyl benzoate derivative. The substituent is `-COOCH3`.\n    *   Case B: The ring is attached to the ester oxygen, forming a phenyl acetate derivative. The substituent is `-O-CO-CH3`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Molecular Formula**\n\nLet's calculate the total formula by summing the atoms from the fragments. Both Case A and Case B lead to the same final formula. Let's use Case A for the calculation:\n\n*   **Carbons (C):**\n    *   From the benzene ring (C6H4): 6\n    *   From the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3): 3\n    *   From the methyl ester group (-COOCH3): 1 (carbonyl C) + 1 (methyl C) = 2\n    *   **Total C = 6 + 3 + 2 = 11**\n\n*   **Hydrogens (H):**\n    *   From the benzene ring (C6H4): 4\n    *   From the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3): 5\n    *   From the methyl ester group (-COOCH3): 3\n    *   **Total H = 4 + 5 + 3 = 12**\n\n*   **Oxygens (O):**\n    *   From the ester group (-COO-): 2\n    *   **Total O = 2**\n\nCombining these, the molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**4. Verify with Degrees of Unsaturation (DBE)**\n\nThe DBE indicates the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n*   **From the derived structure:**\n    *   Benzene ring = 1 ring + 3 double bonds = 4 DBE\n    *   Vinyl C=C bond = 1 DBE\n    *   Ester C=O bond = 1 DBE\n    *   **Total DBE = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6**\n\n*   **From the proposed formula (C11H12O2):**\n    *   DBE = C - (H/2) + 1 = 11 - (12/2) + 1 = 11 - 6 + 1 = 6\n\nThe DBE calculated from the structure (6) matches the DBE calculated from the formula C11H12O2 (6), confirming its plausibility.\n\n**5. Evaluate the Other Options**\n\nLet's quickly check the DBE for the other formulas provided:\n*   **A) C12H14O2:** DBE = 12 - (14/2) + 1 = 6. While the DBE is correct, this formula has an extra C and 2H (a CH2 unit) compared to our derived formula. This contradicts the \"no –CH2 groups\" information from the NMR spectrum.\n*   **C) C11H14O2:** DBE = 11 - (14/2) + 1 = 5. Incorrect DBE.\n*   **D) C12H12O2:** DBE = 12 - (12/2) + 1 = 7. Incorrect DBE.\n\nTherefore, C11H12O2 is the only formula that is fully consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nThe reasoning is as follows:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the given information:**\n    *   **Skeleton:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we start with a benzene ring (C6) with two hydrogen atoms replaced by other groups. The remaining part of the ring is C6H4. The aromatic ring itself accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (DBE).\n    *   **FTIR:** An ester group is present (-COO-). This adds 1 carbon, 2 oxygens, and 1 degree of unsaturation (from the C=O double bond). Total DBE so far is 4 + 1 = 5.\n    *   **1H NMR:**\n        *   **2 aromatic-H signals:** A di-substituted benzene ring with two aromatic signals often implies a 1,4 (*para*) substitution pattern, which creates chemical symmetry.\n        *   **2 vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This splitting pattern is a classic signature for a `-CH=CH-CH3` group (a propenyl group). The vinyl proton adjacent to the methyl group is split into a doublet of quartets, and the other vinyl proton is a doublet. This group contributes C3H5 to the formula and another degree of unsaturation (from the C=C double bond). The total DBE is now 5 + 1 = 6.\n        *   **2 -CH3 signals:** One methyl group is from the propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`). The other must be part of the ester group.\n        *   **No -CH2 signals:** This is a critical piece of information. It eliminates possibilities like an ethyl ester (`-COOCH2CH3`) or other longer alkyl chains.\n\n2.  **Assemble the molecule:**\n    *   We have the `C6H4` core.\n    *   We have a propenyl substituent: `-C3H5`.\n    *   We have an ester substituent containing a methyl group and no methylene (`-CH2-`) groups. The only simple possibility is a methyl ester: `-COOCH3`. This fragment contributes `C2H3O2`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the total chemical formula:**\n    *   **Carbon:** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from methyl ester) = **11 Carbons**\n    *   **Hydrogen:** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from methyl ester) = **12 Hydrogens**\n    *   **Oxygen:** 2 (from methyl ester) = **2 Oxygens**\n    *   The final formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Verify with the provided options and DBE:**\n    *   The derived formula, C11H12O2, corresponds to option B.\n    *   The Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) for C11H12O2 is calculated as `C - H/2 + 1 = 11 - 12/2 + 1 = 11 - 6 + 1 = 6`. This matches our structural analysis (1 ring + 1 C=C + 1 C=O = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 DBE).\n    *   Let's check the other options. For example, C12H14O2 (Option D) also has 6 DBE. However, to form this molecule while keeping the core structure, one would need to add a CH2 group (e.g., making an ethyl ester), which contradicts the NMR data stating there are no -CH2- groups.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the spectral data is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Structural Information:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This implies a benzene ring (C6H6) where two hydrogen atoms are replaced by substituents. The core of the molecule is therefore a C6H4 group, which contains 4 aromatic protons.\n    *   **FTIR - Ester group:** The presence of an ester group (-COO-) is confirmed. This accounts for two oxygen atoms and one carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   **No -CH2 groups:** The 1H NMR spectrum shows no signals for -CH2 groups. This is a critical piece of information that helps eliminate many potential structures.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Six signals total:** This indicates six chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 protons. If these 4 protons give only two signals, it strongly suggests a para (1,4) substitution pattern. In a para-substituted ring with two different substituents (R1-C6H4-R2), the protons at positions 2 and 6 are equivalent, and the protons at positions 3 and 5 are equivalent, leading to two distinct signals (an AA'BB' system).\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H:** This indicates a C=C double bond with two hydrogens. Let's call them Ha and Hb.\n        *   One signal is a **doublet**. This means the corresponding proton (e.g., Ha) is coupled to only one other proton (Hb).\n        *   The other signal is a **doublet of quartets**. This means the other proton (Hb) is coupled to two sets of protons: one proton (the doublet part, from Ha) and a group of three equivalent protons (the quartet part). A group of three equivalent protons is a methyl (-CH3) group.\n        *   This specific splitting pattern perfectly describes a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**.\n    *   **Two signals for -CH3 groups:**\n        *   One -CH3 signal comes from the propenyl group (-CH=CH-**CH3**) we just identified.\n        *   The other -CH3 signal must belong to the ester group. Since there are no -CH2- groups allowed, this ester cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) or anything larger. It must be either a **methyl ester (-COOCH3)** or an **acetate ester (-O-CO-CH3)**.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Molecular Structure and Determine the Formula:**\n\n    Let's assemble the identified fragments:\n    *   Fragment 1: A para-substituted benzene ring (**C6H4**)\n    *   Fragment 2: A propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3, which has a formula of **C3H5**)\n    *   Fragment 3: An ester group containing a methyl group.\n        *   Case A: A methyl ester group (-COOCH3, which has a formula of **C2H3O2**)\n        *   Case B: An acetoxy group (-O-CO-CH3, which has a formula of **C2H3O2**)\n\n    Both possible ester groups have the same atomic composition. Now, let's sum the atoms from all fragments to find the molecular formula:\n\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5) + 2 (from C2H3O2) = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from C3H5) + 3 (from C2H3O2) = **12**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from C2H3O2) = **2**\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Verify with Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n\n    The Degree of Unsaturation tells us the total number of rings and pi bonds.\n    *   From the structure: Benzene ring (4 DoU) + C=C double bond (1 DoU) + C=O double bond (1 DoU) = **6 DoU**.\n    *   Let's check the DoU for the candidate formula C11H12O2 using the formula DoU = C + 1 - H/2:\n        *   DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**.\n    *   The DoU matches, confirming our structural analysis.\n\n5.  **Evaluate Other Options:**\n    *   **A) C12H14O2:** DoU = 12 + 1 - 14/2 = 6. While the DoU is correct, this formula has an extra CH2 compared to our derived formula (C11H12O2). Adding a CH2 group would create a -CH2- signal in the NMR, which is explicitly absent.\n    *   **B) C12H12O2:** DoU = 12 + 1 - 12/2 = 7. This DoU is incorrect.\n    *   **C) C11H14O2:** DoU = 11 + 1 - 14/2 = 5. This DoU is incorrect.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the provided spectroscopic data, the only possible chemical formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Information from the Spectra and Description:**\n\n*   **Structure:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This indicates a benzene ring (C6H6) with two hydrogen atoms replaced by substituents. The core formula for this part is C6H4.\n*   **FTIR:** An ester group is present. This is a functional group with the structure R-COO-R', containing one C=O bond and one C-O bond. It adds two oxygen atoms (O2) to the formula.\n*   **1H NMR - Aromatic Region:** There are two signals for aromatic protons. A disubstituted benzene ring gives two signals for its aromatic protons only when it has a plane of symmetry, which is characteristic of a **1,4- (para) substitution pattern**. Ortho (1,2) and meta (1,3) substitution would each result in four distinct signals for the four aromatic protons.\n*   **1H NMR - Vinyl Region:** There are two signals for vinyl protons (-CH=CH-).\n    *   One signal is a **doublet**. This means the proton is coupled to only one adjacent proton.\n    *   The other signal is a **doublet of quartets**. The \"doublet\" part arises from coupling to the other vinyl proton. The \"quartet\" part (splitting into 4 lines) arises from coupling to three equivalent adjacent protons, which must be a methyl (-CH3) group.\n    *   This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**. Let's label the protons: R-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3. Proton H(a) is split by H(b) into a doublet. Proton H(b) is split by H(a) into a doublet, and by the three protons of the CH3 group into a quartet, resulting in a doublet of quartets. This fragment has the formula **C3H5**.\n*   **1H NMR - Alkyl Region:**\n    *   There are **two signals for -CH3 groups**. We've already identified one from the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3). This methyl group is adjacent to a vinyl proton, so it would appear as a doublet.\n    *   The second -CH3 signal must belong to the ester group. Since there are no -CH2- groups, the ester cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) or anything larger. It must be either a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH3). In either case, the methyl group is isolated and would appear as a singlet.\n    *   The fragment containing the ester and the second methyl group has the formula **C2H3O2**.\n*   **No -CH2- groups:** This is a crucial piece of information that rules out many possibilities like ethyl, propyl, or allyl groups.\n\n**2. Assemble the Fragments to Determine the Molecular Formula:**\n\nNow, let's sum the atoms from the deduced fragments to find the overall molecular formula.\n\n*   **Aromatic ring (para-substituted):** C6H4\n*   **Propenyl side chain:** C3H5\n*   **Ester and methyl part:** C2H3O2\n\nTotal count:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**3. Verification with Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n\nThe DBE is a useful check.\n*   DBE = C + 1 - (H/2)\n*   DBE = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**\n\nLet's check the DBE from the proposed structure:\n*   Benzene ring = 1 ring + 3 π-bonds = 4 DBE\n*   C=C double bond in the propenyl group = 1 DBE\n*   C=O double bond in the ester group = 1 DBE\n*   Total DBE = 4 + 1 + 1 = **6**\nThe calculated DBE matches the DBE derived from the formula, confirming that C11H12O2 is the correct formula for the described structure.\n\n**4. Compare with the Given Options:**\n\n*   A) C12H12O2\n*   B) C11H14O2\n*   C) C11H12O2\n*   D) C12H14O2\n\nOur derived formula, C11H12O2, matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Structural Information:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This tells us we start with a benzene ring (C6H6) that has two hydrogen atoms replaced by other groups. The core of this part is therefore C6H4.\n    *   **FTIR shows an ester group:** An ester functional group has the structure R-COO-R'. This group contains one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms (-COO-). This accounts for the O2 in all the given options.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a critical constraint. The final structure cannot contain any methylene (-CH2-) groups.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons. The fact that they show up as only two signals strongly suggests a *para* (1,4) substitution pattern due to the molecule's symmetry. This doesn't change the atom count (still C6H4), but it helps in visualizing the structure.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** Vinyl protons are hydrogens attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (-CH=CH-).\n        *   The splitting patterns give a crucial clue. A doublet of quartets (dq) means a proton is coupled to one adjacent proton (giving the doublet) and to three other equivalent protons (giving the quartet). This pattern is characteristic of a proton in a `-CH=CH-CH3` group. The proton on the carbon adjacent to the CH3 group will be split into a dq.\n        *   The other vinyl proton would be a doublet, as it's only coupled to its vinyl partner.\n        *   Therefore, the NMR data indicates the presence of a **propenyl group** (`-CH=CH-CH3`). This fragment consists of 3 carbons and 5 hydrogens (C3H5). It also accounts for one of the two methyl groups mentioned.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:**\n        *   We have already identified one CH3 group as part of the propenyl fragment (`-CH=CH-CH3`).\n        *   The presence of a second CH3 signal means there is another methyl group (`-CH3`) elsewhere in the molecule. This fragment is C1H3.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Pieces and Calculate the Formula:**\n    Let's sum the atoms from all the fragments we've identified based on the spectral data:\n    *   **Aromatic ring:** C6H4\n    *   **Ester group (carbonyl part):** C (the COO carbon) and O2\n    *   **Propenyl group:** C3H5 (This accounts for the vinyl protons and one CH3 group)\n    *   **Second methyl group:** C1H3\n\n    Now, let's total the atoms:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from ring) + 1 (from ester) + 3 (from propenyl) + 1 (from the other methyl) = 11\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from the other methyl) = 12\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from ester) = 2\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    The DoU formula is C - H/2 + N/2 + 1. For C11H12O2:\n    DoU = 11 - (12/2) + 1 = 11 - 6 + 1 = 6.\n    Let's check if our proposed structure matches this DoU:\n    *   Benzene ring: 4 degrees of unsaturation (1 ring + 3 double bonds)\n    *   C=C double bond (from the propenyl group): 1 degree of unsaturation\n    *   C=O double bond (from the ester group): 1 degree of unsaturation\n    *   Total DoU = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n    The calculated DoU matches the structural features deduced from the spectra.\n\n5.  **Evaluate Other Options:**\n    *   **C11H14O2:** DoU = 5. This is inconsistent with the presence of a benzene ring, a C=C bond, and a C=O bond.\n    *   **C12H14O2:** DoU = 6. To get this formula from C11H12O2, one must add a CH2 unit. However, the NMR data explicitly states there are no –CH2 groups.\n    *   **C12H12O2:** DoU = 7. This requires an additional degree of unsaturation (e.g., another double bond or ring) compared to our deduced structure, which is not supported by the NMR data.\n\nThe only formula that perfectly matches all the spectroscopic evidence is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nAn example of a compound that fits all the described data is **methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate**. Let's break down its structure and see how it matches the evidence.\n\n*   **Structure:**\n    *   A benzene ring is substituted at the 1 and 4 positions (para).\n    *   One substituent is a methyl ester group (-COOCH3).\n    *   The other substituent is a prop-1-en-1-yl group (-CH=CH-CH3).\n*   **Formula Calculation:**\n    *   Benzene ring core: C6H4\n    *   Methyl ester group: C2H3O2\n    *   Prop-1-en-1-yl group: C3H5\n    *   Total: C(6+2+3) H(4+3+5) O(2) = **C11H12O2**\n*   **Spectroscopic Data Match:**\n    *   **FTIR:** The methyl ester group (-COOCH3) is an ester. This matches.\n    *   **1H NMR:**\n        *   **Aromatic-H:** The para-substitution pattern gives two signals for the 4 aromatic protons (two doublets). This matches (2 signals).\n        *   **Vinyl-H:** The -CH=CH- part gives two signals for the two vinyl protons. This matches (2 signals). The splitting would be a doublet and a doublet of quartets as described.\n        *   **–CH3 Groups:** There is one methyl group in the ester (-COOCH3) and one in the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3). These are in different chemical environments, so they give two distinct signals. This matches (2 signals).\n        *   **No –CH2 Groups:** The structure contains no -CH2- units. This matches.\n\nThe molecular formula C11H12O2 is the only one that is consistent with the detailed structural information derived from the NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning to identify the correct chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Structure:** The problem states the compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" This means we start with a benzene ring (C6H6) and replace two hydrogen atoms with other groups. The core of our molecule is therefore C6H4.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Spectroscopic Data:**\n    *   **FTIR:** Shows an ester group (-COO-). This accounts for the two oxygen atoms in the formula.\n    *   **1H NMR:**\n        *   **Two Aromatic-H Signals:** For a di-substituted benzene ring, having only two signals in the aromatic region strongly suggests a 1,4- (para-) substitution pattern due to the molecule's symmetry.\n        *   **Two Vinyl-H Signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3).\n            *   The proton on the carbon attached to the ring is split only by the other vinyl proton, resulting in a doublet.\n            *   The other vinyl proton is split by the first vinyl proton (making it a doublet) and also by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (making it a quartet). The combined effect is a doublet of quartets.\n            *   This substituent adds a C3H5 group to our formula.\n        *   **Two -CH3 Signals:** One signal is from the propenyl group's methyl (`-CH=CH-CH3`). The second signal must belong to the ester group.\n        *   **No -CH2 Signals:** The absence of a -CH2 signal is crucial. It eliminates possibilities like an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3). Therefore, the ester must be a methyl ester (-COOCH3). This substituent adds a C2H3O2 group.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Full Formula:**\n    *   Start with the aromatic core: C6H4\n    *   Add the propenyl group: + C3H5\n    *   Add the methyl ester group: + C2H3O2\n\n    Now, let's sum the atoms:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 0 + 0 + 2 = 2\n\n    The final molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated formula C11H12O2 matches option C.\n\nThe Python code executed in the previous step also confirmed this calculation, summing the atoms of a para-disubstituted benzene ring (C6H4), a propenyl group (C3H5), and a methyl ester group (COOCH3) to arrive at C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nMy reasoning has identified the following key points:\n1.  **Aromatic Ring + Di-substitution**: This gives a base of `C6H4`.\n2.  **Ester Group**: The FTIR shows a `-COO-` group.\n3.  **1H NMR Analysis**:\n    *   No `-CH2-` groups.\n    *   Two aromatic signals (likely `para`-substitution).\n    *   Vinyl signals (doublet and doublet of quartets) strongly suggest a `-CH=CH-CH3` (propenyl) group.\n    *   Two `-CH3` signals correspond to the `-CH=CH-CH3` and a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`). The methyl ester is necessary to have an ester group without a `-CH2-`.\n4.  **Assembling the Structure**: Combining the parts (`C6H4`, `-CH=CH-CH3`, and `-COOCH3`) leads to the structure of methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate.\n5.  **Calculating the Formula**:\n    *   Carbons: 6 (ring) + 3 (propenyl) + 2 (ester) = 11\n    *   Hydrogens: 4 (ring) + 5 (propenyl) + 3 (ester methyl) = 12\n    *   Oxygens: 2 (ester)\n    *   The resulting formula is `C11H12O2`.\n6.  **Verification with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**:\n    *   The proposed structure has 1 ring (DoU=4), 1 C=C bond (DoU=1), and 1 C=O bond (DoU=1), for a total DoU of 6.\n    *   The code output confirms that `C11H12O2` has a DoU of 6, matching the requirement.\n    *   The code output also confirms that while `C12H14O2` also has a DoU of 6, it differs from the deduced structure by a `CH2` unit, which contradicts the NMR data.\n\nAll evidence points to `C11H12O2`.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Basic Structure:** The problem states the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This corresponds to a benzene ring (C6) with two substituents, meaning four hydrogens are directly attached to the ring. The core of the molecule is therefore C6H4.\n\n2.  **Interpret the FTIR Spectrum:** The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of an ester group (-COO-). An ester group contains one carbonyl group (C=O) and one ether-like oxygen. It contributes two oxygen atoms to the molecular formula.\n\n3.  **Interpret the 1H NMR Spectrum:** This provides the most detailed information about the structure.\n    *   **Aromatic-H signals (2 signals):** A di-substituted benzene ring with two distinct signals for its four protons is characteristic of a 1,4 (para) substitution pattern. This gives two sets of two equivalent protons, each appearing as a doublet. This confirms the C6H4 core.\n    *   **Vinyl-H signals (2 signals):** There are two hydrogens on a carbon-carbon double bond. One signal is a doublet, and the other is a doublet of quartets. This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3).\n        *   The H atom adjacent to the CH3 group is split by the other vinyl H (into a doublet) and by the three protons of the CH3 group (into a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets.\n        *   The other vinyl H is split only by its vinyl neighbor, resulting in a doublet.\n        *   This fragment has the formula C3H5.\n    *   **-CH3 signals (2 signals):** There are two distinct methyl (-CH3) groups.\n        *   One of these belongs to the propenyl group we just identified (-CH=CH-**CH3**).\n        *   The other must be part of the ester group.\n    *   **No –CH2 groups:** This is a critical piece of information. It means there are no methylene groups in the structure. The ester cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3), and the other substituent cannot be an allyl group (-CH2-CH=CH2) or a propyl group (-CH2CH2CH3). This supports our identification of the methyl-containing ester and the propenyl group. The ester group must be either a methyl ester (Ar-COO-CH3) or an acetate group (Ar-O-CO-CH3). Both contain one CH3 group and no CH2 groups.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Formula:** Now we can assemble the molecular fragments we have identified to find the total chemical formula.\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** C6H4\n    *   **Propenyl Group:** -CH=CH-CH3 → C3H5\n    *   **Ester functionality with a methyl group:** This can be either a methyl carboxylate (-COOCH3) or an acetate (-OCOCH3).\n        *   The -COOCH3 fragment contributes C=2, H=3, O=2.\n        *   The -OCOCH3 fragment contributes C=2, H=3, O=2.\n        *   Both possibilities add C2H3O2 to the formula.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Formula:** Sum the atoms from all the fragments:\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from ester) = 11\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from ester's methyl) = 12\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from ester) = 2\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   A) C12H14O2\n    *   B) C12H12O2\n    *   C) C11H12O2\n    *   D) C11H14O2\n\n    The calculated formula C11H12O2 matches option C. The other formulas are inconsistent with the NMR data, particularly the absence of -CH2- signals. For instance, C11H14O2 would imply saturation of the propenyl double bond to a propyl group, which would have CH2 signals. C12H14O2 could correspond to an ethyl ester, which would also have a CH2 signal.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the given spectroscopic data to identify key structural features and fragments of the molecule.**\n\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\":** This indicates the core of the molecule is a benzene ring with two substituents attached, having the base formula C6H4. A benzene ring accounts for a degree of unsaturation of 4 (one ring and three double bonds).\n\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum ... shows absorption peaks indicating the presence of an ester group\":** This confirms the presence of a -COO- functional group. An ester group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), which adds one degree of unsaturation.\n\n    *   **\"1H NMR spectrum shows six signals\":** This tells us there are six chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n        *   **\"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\":** A di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4) has 4 aromatic protons. The fact that they appear as two signals suggests an ortho or meta substitution pattern, where protons are in at least two different chemical environments.\n        *   **\"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\":** This splitting pattern is highly characteristic of a propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH3). The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by both the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and the three methyl protons (creating a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets (dq). The other vinyl proton is split only by the first vinyl proton, resulting in a doublet (d). This fragment has the formula C3H5 and contains one carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), adding another degree of unsaturation.\n        *   **\"two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups\":** One of these methyl signals comes from the propenyl group (–CH=CH–**CH3**). The presence of a second, distinct –CH3 signal indicates another methyl group is present elsewhere in the molecule.\n        *   **\"no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups\":** This is a crucial constraint. It eliminates possibilities such as ethyl (–CH2CH3), propyl (–CH2CH2CH3), or any other group containing a methylene (–CH2–) unit.\n\n2.  **Assemble the identified fragments into a complete structure.**\n\n    We have the following pieces to assemble:\n    *   A C6H4 benzene ring core.\n    *   An ester linkage (–COO–).\n    *   A propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH3).\n    *   A second methyl group (–CH3).\n\n    The compound is di-substituted, meaning two groups are attached to the C6H4 ring. These two substituent groups must be formed from the remaining fragments: the ester, the propenyl group, and the methyl group. There are two primary ways to assemble this:\n\n    *   **Possibility A:** The two substituents are a propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH3) and an acetoxy group (–O–CO–CH3). The structure would be a propenylphenyl acetate isomer (e.g., 4-propenylphenyl acetate). This structure is consistent with all the NMR data.\n\n    *   **Possibility B:** The two substituents are a propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH3) and a methoxycarbonyl group (–CO–O–CH3). The structure would be a methyl propenylbenzoate isomer (e.g., methyl 4-propenylbenzoate). This structure is also consistent with all the NMR data.\n\n3.  **Calculate the molecular formula for the proposed structure(s).**\n\n    Let's calculate the formula for either possibility, as they are composed of the same atoms.

Compared to C11H12O2 (degree of unsaturation = 6), this formula implies the loss of one double bond. This would contradict the presence of either the C=C (no vinyl signals) or C=O (no ester) bond. Incorrect.\n    *   **C12H12O2:** Degree of unsaturation is 7. This requires an additional double bond or ring compared to our derived structure. It is not possible to add another carbon and maintain the \"no -CH2-\" rule and the specific NMR splitting patterns described. Incorrect.\n    *   **C12H14O2:** Degree of unsaturation is 6. This formula contains an extra CH2 group compared to our C11H12O2 structure. The presence of a CH2 group is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data. Incorrect.\n\nThe only formula that perfectly matches all the detailed spectroscopic evidence is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the core structure:** The problem states the compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This means we start with a benzene ring that has two substituents, so its formula is C6H4. The `1H NMR` spectrum shows only two signals for aromatic protons, which strongly suggests a 1,4- (or para-) substitution pattern, as this symmetry would make the protons at positions 2 and 6 equivalent, and the protons at positions 3 and 5 equivalent, resulting in two signals.\n\n2.  **Identify the functional groups from the spectra:**\n    *   **FTIR:** Shows an ester group (-COO-). This accounts for the two oxygen atoms in the molecular formula options.\n    *   **¹H NMR:**\n        *   **No –CH2 groups:** This is a critical piece of information that eliminates many possibilities, such as ethyl esters (-COOCH2CH3), ethyl groups (-CH2CH3), or propyl groups (-CH2CH2CH3) as substituents.\n        *   **Two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group, -CH=CH-CH3.\n            *   Let's label the protons: -CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3(c).\n            *   The proton H(a) is split only by H(b), so it appears as a doublet.\n            *   The proton H(b) is split by H(a) (a doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (a quartet), so it appears as a doublet of quartets.\n            *   This confirms the presence of a -CH=CH-CH3 group. This fragment has the formula C3H5.\n        *   **Two –CH3 signals:**\n            *   One of these methyl signals belongs to the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3). Its protons would be split by the adjacent vinyl proton H(b), appearing as a doublet.\n            *   The second methyl signal must be part of the ester group. Since there are no -CH2- groups, it cannot be an ethyl ester. It must be a methyl group attached directly to the ester, either as a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate group (-O-CO-CH3). In either case, this fragment contributes C2H3O2 to the overall formula.\n\n3.  **Assemble the fragments and determine the molecular formula:**\n    *   Aromatic ring: C6H4\n    *   Propenyl group: C3H5\n    *   Ester and methyl group fragment (-COOCH3 or -OCOCH3): C2H3O2\n\n    Now, sum the atoms from these fragments:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from ester/methyl) = 11\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from ester/methyl) = 12\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from ester)\n\n    The calculated molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Compare the result with the given options:**\n    *   A) C11H14O2\n    *   B) C11H12O2\n    *   C) C12H12O2\n    *   D) C12H14O2\n\n    Our calculated formula, C11H12O2, matches option B. Let's briefly check why the other options are incorrect based on the data:\n    *   C11H14O2 and C12H14O2: These formulas have more hydrogen atoms, which implies more saturation. To fit the description, you would likely need to replace the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) with a propyl group (-CH2CH2CH3) or add a CH2 group elsewhere, both of which are ruled out by the \"no -CH2 groups\" constraint.\n    *   C12H12O2: This would require adding one carbon atom without adding hydrogen atoms relative to our derived structure. This is not possible given the fragments identified from the NMR spectrum.\n\nTherefore, the only formula consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the information from the 1H NMR spectrum to determine the number of hydrogen atoms.**\n    The spectrum shows signals for several types of protons (H). By summing up the number of protons represented by each signal type, we can find the total number of hydrogen atoms in the molecule.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** In a di-substituted benzene ring, there are 4 aromatic protons. The fact that they appear as two signals strongly suggests a para (1,4) substitution pattern, where symmetry causes the 4 protons to fall into two equivalent sets of two (2H + 2H). Total aromatic protons = 4H.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H:** Vinyl protons are those attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (-CH=CH-). The description of one signal as a doublet and the other as a doublet of quartets is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3). In this group, there are two vinyl protons. Total vinyl protons = 2H.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:** This indicates the presence of two distinct methyl groups in the molecule. Each methyl group has 3 protons. Total methyl protons = 2 * 3H = 6H.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This confirms the absence of any methylene groups in the structure.\n\n    Now, let's sum the protons:\n    Total H = (aromatic H) + (vinyl H) + (methyl H)\n    Total H = 4 + 2 + 6 = 12 hydrogens.\n\n    This result immediately allows us to eliminate the options with 14 hydrogens.\n    *   B) C11H14O2 is incorrect.\n    *   D) C12H14O2 is incorrect.\n\n    The correct formula must be either A) C12H12O2 or C) C11H12O2.\n\n2.  **Analyze the structural fragments to determine the number of carbon atoms.**\n    We can identify the fragments of the molecule from the spectroscopic data and then sum their carbon atoms.\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This is a benzene ring (C6) with two hydrogen atoms replaced by substituents. The carbon framework is C6.\n    *   **Ester group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms an ester group, which has the core structure -COO-. This contributes 1 carbon atom.\n    *   **Vinyl group:** As determined from the NMR splitting patterns (doublet and doublet of quartets), the vinyl protons are part of a propenyl group, -CH=CH-CH3. This fragment contains 3 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Methyl groups:** The NMR shows two -CH3 signals. One belongs to the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3). The other must be part of the ester functional group. There are two common possibilities: a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate group (-OCOCH3).\n        *   In a methyl ester, the second CH3 is attached to the oxygen. The carbons are already counted in the ester's C=O and the methyl group itself.\n        *   In an acetate group, the second CH3 is attached to the carbonyl carbon.\n\n    Let's assemble the most likely structure and count the total carbons.\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring substituted with a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) and a methyl ester group (-COOCH3). A plausible isomer is methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate.\n    *   **Carbon Count:**\n        *   Benzene ring: 6 carbons\n        *   Propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3): 3 carbons\n        *   Ester group (-COOCH3): The C=O carbon is 1, and the -OCH3 carbon is 1. Total = 2 carbons.\n        *   This seems double-counted. Let's count from the fragments that make up the whole molecule:\n            1.  C6H4 ring = 6 carbons\n            2.  Propenyl group, -CH=CH-CH3 = 3 carbons\n            3.  Methyl part of the ester, -OCH3 = 1 carbon\n            4.  Carbonyl part of the ester, C=O = 1 carbon\n        *   Let's recount based on the pieces: The molecule is composed of a propenyl group (C3), a benzene ring (C6), and a methyl carboxylate group (-COOCH3) where one C is the carbonyl and one C is the methyl. So, C3 + C6 + C1(carbonyl) + C1(methyl) = 11 carbons.\n\n    Let's try the other possibility: an acetate group.\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring substituted with a propenyl group and an acetate group (-OCOCH3). A plausible isomer is 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)phenyl acetate.\n    *   **Carbon Count:**\n        *   Benzene ring: 6 carbons\n        *   Propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3): 3 carbons\n        *   Acetate group (-OCOCH3): The C=O carbon is 1, and the -CH3 carbon is 1. Total = 2 carbons.\n    *   Total carbons in the molecule = 6 + 3 + 2 = 11 carbons.\n\n    Both plausible structures consistent with all the spectral data have 11 carbon atoms.\n\n3.  **Combine the results to identify the final formula.**\n    *   From step 1, the number of hydrogens is 12.\n    *   From step 2, the number of carbons is 11.\n    *   The FTIR data indicates an ester, which contains 2 oxygen atoms.\n    *   Therefore, the chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\nFinal check with the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) formula: DBE = C + 1 - H/2.\nFor C11H12O2, DBE = 11 + 1 - 12/2 = 12 - 6 = 6.\nThe proposed structure contains a benzene ring (4 DBE), a C=C double bond (1 DBE), and a C=O double bond from the ester (1 DBE). Total DBE = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6. The DBE calculation is consistent with the proposed structure and the formula C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the given information from the problem statement:**\n    *   **Structure:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This implies a benzene ring with two substituents, which has a core formula of C6H4 and 4 aromatic protons. The aromatic ring itself accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation.\n    *   **FTIR Spectroscopy:** An ester group (-COO-) is present. An ester contains a carbonyl group (C=O), which accounts for 1 degree of unsaturation.\n    *   **1H NMR Spectroscopy:** This gives us the most detailed information about the proton environment.\n        *   **Six total signals:** This indicates six different types of protons in the molecule.\n        *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** This is consistent with the 4 protons on a di-substituted benzene ring (e.g., ortho or meta substitution where protons are not all equivalent). Let's assume a total of 4 aromatic hydrogens.\n        *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** Vinyl protons are attached to a C=C double bond. This splitting pattern is a classic signature for a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) attached to another group.\n            *   Let's denote the group as R-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3.\n            *   H(a) is split by H(b), resulting in a **doublet**.\n            *   H(b) is split by H(a) (a doublet) and the three protons of the -CH3 group (a quartet), resulting in a **doublet of quartets**.\n            *   This confirms the presence of a C=C bond (1 degree of unsaturation) and a propenyl fragment. This fragment has 2 vinyl protons and a methyl group.\n        *   **Two signals for -CH3 groups:**\n            *   One -CH3 group is the one from the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3). It would be a doublet due to coupling with the adjacent vinyl proton H(b).\n            *   The second -CH3 group must be from another part of the molecule. Given the presence of an ester, and the constraint of no -CH2 groups, this must be a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate group (-OOCCH3). This methyl group would be a singlet.\n        *   **No signals for -CH2 groups:** This is a crucial piece of data that eliminates possibilities like ethyl, propyl, or other alkyl chains containing a methylene (-CH2-) unit.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Molecular Fragments:**\n    *   Aromatic ring: C6H4 (4 Hydrogens)\n    *   Propenyl group: -CH=CH-CH3 (Fragment formula: C3H5; 5 Hydrogens)\n    *   Ester group and the second methyl group. This can be either a methyl carboxylate group (-COOCH3) or an acetoxy group (-OOCCH3).\n        *   In both cases, the fragment that needs to be added is composed of C, O, O, CH3. (Fragment formula: COOCH3; 3 Hydrogens).\n\n3.  **Calculate the Total Molecular Formula:**\n    Let's sum up the atoms from the assembled fragments:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5) + 1 (from C=O) + 1 (from O-CH3) = **11 carbons**.\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from C3H5) + 3 (from -COOCH3) = **12 hydrogens**.\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from the ester group -COO-) = **2 oxygens**.\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Verify the Degrees of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    *   DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DBE for C11H12O2 = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**.\n    *   Let's check this against our structure: Benzene ring (4 DBE) + C=C bond in the propenyl group (1 DBE) + C=O bond in the ester (1 DBE) = 6 DBE. The calculated DBE matches the deduced structure.\n\n5.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   A) C11H14O2: Incorrect. This would have a DBE of 5. It implies saturation of one double bond, which would introduce -CH2- groups, contradicting the NMR data.\n    *   B) C12H12O2: Incorrect. This would have a DBE of 7. It would require an additional double bond or ring, which is not supported by the spectral data.\n    *   C) C11H12O2: **Correct.** This formula perfectly matches our analysis of the spectral data.\n    *   D) C12H14O2: Incorrect. This has a DBE of 6, but it contains an extra CH2 group compared to C11H12O2, which is explicitly ruled out.\n\nThe spectroscopic evidence strongly and unambiguously points to the molecular formula C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data to Determine the Number of Hydrogen Atoms:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H:** The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means there are 4 hydrogen atoms attached to the benzene ring (C6H4). The fact that there are two signals for these protons is consistent with a substitution pattern like ortho or para, where protons can be chemically equivalent or have similar environments. (4H)\n    *   **Vinyl-H:** There are two signals for vinyl protons, indicating a `-CH=CH-` group. (2H)\n    *   **-CH3 groups:** There are two distinct signals for methyl groups. Each methyl group (-CH3) has 3 protons. So, in total, there are 2 * 3 = 6 protons from methyl groups. (6H)\n    *   **Total Hydrogen Count:** Summing up the protons from all signals gives the total number of hydrogen atoms in the molecule: 4 (aromatic) + 2 (vinyl) + 6 (methyl) = 12 hydrogens.\n\n2.  **Filter the Options Based on the Hydrogen Count:**\n    The molecular formula must have 12 hydrogen atoms. Let's check the given options:\n    A) C11H12O2 (H=12) -> Possible\n    B) C12H12O2 (H=12) -> Possible\n    C) C11H14O2 (H=14) -> Incorrect\n    D) C12H14O2 (H=14) -> Incorrect\n    This eliminates options C and D. We are left with A and B.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Spectroscopic Data to Determine the Structural Fragments and Carbon Count:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This is a `C6H4` group, which contains 6 carbon atoms.\n    *   **FTIR: ester group:** This indicates the presence of a `-COO-` functional group, which contains 1 carbon atom (the carbonyl carbon).\n    *   **1H NMR - Vinyl and Methyl groups:** The description of the vinyl signals (\"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\") is highly characteristic. A doublet of quartets (dq) arises when a proton is coupled to one adjacent proton (giving the doublet) and three other adjacent protons (giving the quartet). This points to a `–CH=CH-CH3` (propenyl) group. The proton on the carbon next to the CH3 group gives the `dq` signal, and the other vinyl proton gives the `d` signal. This propenyl group contains one of the two methyl groups mentioned in the data. The propenyl fragment has 3 carbon atoms.\n    *   **1H NMR - Second Methyl Group:** Since there are two methyl signals, and one is part of the propenyl group, there must be a second, separate `-CH3` group elsewhere in the molecule. This group contains 1 carbon atom.\n    *   **No -CH2 groups:** This confirms that there are no methylene bridges, ethyl groups, or other structures containing `-CH2-`. This constraint is consistent with our fragment identification.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Fragments and Count the Total Carbon Atoms:**\n    The entire molecule is built from the fragments we have identified. We can determine the total number of carbon atoms by summing the carbons from each essential, non-overlapping part of the structure.\n    *   Carbon from the benzene ring (`C6H4`): 6 C\n    *   Carbon from the ester's carbonyl group (`C=O`): 1 C\n    *   Carbons from the propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`): 3 C\n    *   Carbon from the second methyl group (`-CH3`): 1 C\n\n    These fragments must be assembled to form a valid structure, for example, `(CH3-CH=CH)-C6H4-(COOCH3)`. Regardless of the exact arrangement (e.g., it could also be `CH3-C6H4-OOC-CH=CH-CH3`), the total number of carbons required to build a molecule with these specific parts is constant.\n\n    Total Carbon Count = 6 (ring) + 1 (ester C=O) + 3 (propenyl) + 1 (second methyl) = 11 carbons.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The molecule must have 11 carbon atoms and 12 hydrogen atoms. The formula must be C11H12O2. This corresponds to option A. We can also check the degree of unsaturation (DoU) for C11H12O2: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6. This is consistent with a benzene ring (DoU=4), a C=C double bond (DoU=1), and a C=O double bond (DoU=1).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Information into Molecular Fragments:**\n\n*   **Structure Core:** The problem states the compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This means we have a benzene ring (C6H6) where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by substituents. The core of this part of the molecule is therefore **C6H4**. The ¹H NMR spectrum shows two signals for aromatic hydrogens, which is characteristic of a symmetrically substituted ring, most likely a para (1,4) substitution.\n\n*   **Functional Group (FTIR):** The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of an **ester group (-COO-)**. This group contains one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms (**C1O2**).\n\n*   **Alkenyl Group (¹H NMR):** The NMR spectrum shows two signals for vinyl hydrogens (protons on a C=C double bond). The splitting pattern is described as \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\".\n    *   A **doublet of quartets (dq)** indicates a proton that is coupled to one adjacent proton (giving the doublet) and also to three equivalent protons (giving the quartet). This is a classic pattern for a proton in a `-CH=CH-CH3` group, specifically the one attached to the same carbon as the methyl group (`-CH-CH3`).\n    *   A **doublet (d)** would then correspond to the other vinyl proton (`-CH=`), which is only coupled to the first vinyl proton.\n    *   This evidence strongly points to the presence of a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**. This fragment accounts for three carbons and five hydrogens (**C3H5**).\n\n*   **Alkyl Groups (¹H NMR):** The NMR spectrum shows two signals for -CH3 groups.\n    *   One of these methyl groups is part of the propenyl group (-CH=CH-**CH3**) we just identified.\n    *   Therefore, there must be a second, distinct **methyl group (-CH3)** elsewhere in the molecule. This fragment contributes one carbon and three hydrogens (**C1H3**).\n\n*   **Absence of Other Groups (¹H NMR):** The problem explicitly states there are **no signals for -CH2 groups**. This is a critical piece of information that rules out structures containing ethyl, propyl, or other similar alkyl chains.\n\n**2. Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Molecular Formula:**\n\nNow, we sum the atoms from all the identified fragments to determine the overall molecular formula.\n\n*   **Carbon (C) atoms:**\n    *   From the aromatic ring (C6H4): 6 C\n    *   From the ester group (-COO-): 1 C\n    *   From the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3): 3 C\n    *   From the second methyl group (-CH3): 1 C\n    *   **Total Carbon = 6 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 11 C**\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H) atoms:**\n    *   From the aromatic ring (C6H4): 4 H\n    *   From the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3): 5 H\n    *   From the second methyl group (-CH3): 3 H\n    *   **Total Hydrogen = 4 + 5 + 3 = 12 H**\n\n*   **Oxygen (O) atoms:**\n    *   From the ester group (-COO-): 2 O\n    *   **Total Oxygen = 2 O**\n\nPutting it all together, the molecular formula of the compound is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**3. Verify the Conclusion:**\n\n*   The calculated formula, C11H12O2, matches one of the given options.\n*   We can also check the degree of unsaturation (DoU) for C11H12O2 to ensure it is consistent with our proposed structure.\n    *   DoU formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`\n    *   DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**\n*   The required structural features are a benzene ring (DoU = 4), a C=C double bond (DoU = 1), and a C=O double bond (DoU = 1). The total required DoU is 4 + 1 + 1 = 6. The calculated DoU for the formula C11H12O2 matches the structural requirements perfectly.\n*   The other chemical formulas provided are inconsistent with the spectroscopic data. For example, C11H14O2 (DoU=5) would lack the vinyl C=C bond, and C12H14O2 (DoU=6) would require adding a CH2 group, which is explicitly absent.\n\nTherefore, the correct chemical formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nThe user wants me to identify the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on several pieces of spectroscopic data. I will break down each piece of information to determine the constituent atoms.\n\n1.  **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**:\n    *   A benzene ring has the formula C6H6.\n    *   If it is di-substituted, two hydrogen atoms are replaced by other groups.\n    *   This leaves a **C6H4** fragment.\n    *   Running tally: C=6, H=4\n\n2.  **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicates the presence of an ester group\"**:\n    *   An ester group has the functional formula -COO-.\n    *   This adds **2 Oxygen atoms** and **1 Carbon atom** (from the C=O carbonyl).\n    *   Running tally: C=6+1=7, H=4, O=2\n\n3.  **\"1H NMR spectrum shows six signals\"**: This provides information about the hydrogen atoms and their neighboring groups.\n\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\"**: This confirms the C6H4 fragment.

We have already accounted for these 4 hydrogens.\n\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\"**: Vinyl-H are protons attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n        *   A signal that is a \"doublet of quartets\" (dq) is highly characteristic of a proton on a double bond that is adjacent to both another proton on the double bond and a methyl group. This points strongly to a propenyl group fragment: **-CH=CH-CH3**.\n        *   Let's verify the splitting: The H atom on the carbon next to the CH3 group (`=CH-CH3`) is split by the other vinyl H (into a doublet) and by the three protons of the CH3 group (into a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. The other vinyl H (`-CH=`) is split only by its vinyl neighbor, resulting in a doublet.

The base formula for this core is C6H4. The presence of a ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (DOU).\n    *   **FTIR: \"ester group\"**: This indicates the presence of a -COO- functional group. The C=O bond in the ester adds 1 DOU.\n    *   **1H NMR signals**:\n        *   **\"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\"**: A di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4) has 4 protons.

This is consistent with the C6H4 core.\n        *   **\"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\"**: Vinyl protons are hydrogens attached to a C=C double bond. This splitting pattern is highly characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) attached to a group with no protons on the adjacent atom (like the aromatic ring).\n            *   Let's label the group: Ring-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3.\n            *   The signal for H(a) is split only by H(b), so it appears as a doublet.\n            *   The signal for H(b) is split by H(a) (giving a doublet) and by the three protons of the -CH3 group (giving a quartet). The resulting signal is a doublet of quartets.\n            *   This confirms the presence of a propenyl group, -C3H5. This group also contains a C=C double bond, which adds 1 DOU.\n        *   **\"two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups\"**: One -CH3 group is accounted for by the propenyl substituent (-CH=CH-CH3). The second -CH3 signal must belong to the ester group.\n        *   **\"no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups\"**: This is a crucial constraint. It means the ester cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) or have any other alkyl chain longer than a methyl group. Combined with the presence of a second -CH3 signal, this strongly points to the ester being either a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate (-OCOCH3). In both cases, this fragment has the formula C2H3O2.\n\n*   **Step 2: Assemble the identified fragments to determine the molecular formula.**\n    *   Aromatic core: C6H4\n    *   Substituent 1 (propenyl): -CH=CH-CH3, which has the formula C3H5.\n    *   Substituent 2 (ester part): -COOCH3 or -OCOCH3, both having the formula C2H3O2.\n    *   Now, we sum the atoms from these parts to find the total molecular formula:\n        *   Carbon atoms: 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from ester) = 11 carbons.\n        *   Hydrogen atoms: 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from ester) = 12 hydrogens.\n        *   Oxygen atoms: 2 (from ester) = 2 oxygens.\n    *   The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Verify the result by checking the Degrees of Unsaturation (DOU).**\n    *   The structural features identified are: 1 benzene ring (4 DOU), 1 C=C double bond (1 DOU), and 1 C=O double bond (1 DOU).\n    *   Total expected DOU = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n    *   Let's calculate the DOU from the derived formula, C11H12O2, using the formula DOU = C + 1 - H/2.\n    *   DOU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    *   The calculated DOU matches the expected DOU from the structure, confirming our assignment.\n\n*   **Step 4: Compare the derived formula with the given options.**\n    *   A) C12H12O2 (DOU = 7)\n    *   B) C11H14O2 (DOU = 5)\n    *   C) C11H12O2 (DOU = 6)\n    *   D) C12H14O2 (DOU = 6)\n    *   Our derived formula, C11H12O2, matches option C. The other options are inconsistent. For instance, C12H14O2 has the correct DOU, but building a molecule with that formula that also matches the NMR data (no CH2, only two CH3 signals) is not possible. Adding a CH3 to C11H12O2 would necessitate removing an H, creating C12H14O2, but would result in three CH3 signals, which contradicts the data.\n\nTherefore, the chemical formula of the unknown compound must be C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the given spectroscopic data:**\n    *   **FTIR Spectrum:** Indicates the presence of an ester group (-COO-). This accounts for the two oxygen atoms in the molecular formula options.\n    *   **Structure Core:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we have a benzene ring (C6) with two substituents. The base formula for the ring itself, after substitution, is C6H4, assuming the two substituents replace two hydrogen atoms. The 1H NMR data, showing two signals for aromatic hydrogens, strongly suggests a 1,4- (para) substitution pattern, which would have this C6H4 core.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the 1H NMR signals:** The spectrum shows six signals in total. Let's identify the groups responsible for these signals.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** This corresponds to the 4 protons on the di-substituted benzene ring (C6**H4**). A 1,4-disubstituted ring would give two signals for two protons each (typically two doublets), which fits this description.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H:** This indicates a C=C double bond outside the aromatic ring.\n        *   Signal 1: A doublet.\n        *   Signal 2: A doublet of quartets.\n        *   This specific splitting pattern (d and dq) is a classic signature for a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`). The proton on the carbon attached to the ring is split by the other vinyl proton (giving a doublet). The other vinyl proton is split by the first vinyl proton (doublet) and the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. This group has the formula **C3H5**.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:**\n        *   One of these signals belongs to the methyl group of the propenyl (`-CH=CH-CH3`) group we just identified. This methyl group's signal would be a doublet due to splitting by the adjacent vinyl proton.\n        *   The second –CH3 signal must belong to another part of the molecule. Since we know there's an ester, this is likely a methyl group attached to the ester, either as a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate group (`-O-CO-CH3`). In either case, it's a **CH3** group. This signal would appear as a singlet as it has no adjacent protons.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a crucial piece of information. It confirms that there are no ethyl, propyl (other than propenyl), or other methylene-containing chains in the molecule.\n\n3.  **Assemble the molecular structure and determine the formula:**\n    Let's assemble the pieces we have identified:\n    *   A di-substituted benzene ring core: **C6H4**\n    *   A propenyl substituent: **C3H5**\n    *   An ester group containing a methyl group. Let's analyze the two possibilities for the ester substituent:\n        *   Possibility A: A methyl ester group, `-COOCH3`. This has the formula **C2H3O2**.\n        *   Possibility B: An acetoxy group, `-OCOCH3`. This also has the formula **C2H3O2**.\n\n    Now, we sum the atoms from the core (C6H4) and the two substituents (the C3H5 group and the C2H3O2 group) to find the total molecular formula.\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from ester part) = 11\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from methyl of ester) = 12\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from ester) = 2\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Verify with the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    The DoU formula is `DoU = C + 1 - H/2`.\n    For C11H12O2, DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    Let's check the DoU from the proposed structure:\n    *   1 for the benzene ring.\n    *   3 for the double bonds within the benzene ring.\n    *   1 for the vinyl C=C double bond.\n    *   1 for the ester C=O double bond.\n    *   Total DoU = 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n    The DoU matches, confirming the formula is consistent with the structural features.\n\n5.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    The calculated formula C11H12O2 matches option D. The other options are incorrect:\n    *   C12H14O2 and C12H12O2 have the wrong carbon count.\n    *   C11H14O2 has too many hydrogens, which would mean a lower degree of unsaturation (DoU = 5), contradicting the presence of the aromatic ring, a vinyl group, and a carbonyl group.\n    *   Furthermore, any option with more than 12 hydrogens or containing a -CH2- unit would contradict the NMR data. For example, C11H14O2 would likely arise from reducing the C=C bond of the propenyl group to a C-C bond (propyl group, -CH2CH2CH3), but this would eliminate the vinyl signals and introduce two CH2 signals.\n\nTherefore, the only possible formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nThis is a classic structure elucidation problem that can be solved by systematically piecing together the information from the provided spectra.\n\n**1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data to Determine the Number of Hydrogens and Structural Fragments:**\n\n*   **Aromatic-H signals (2 signals):** A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring (a benzene ring) has 4 protons on the ring itself (formula C6H4). The presence of only two signals for these four protons strongly suggests a *para* (1,4) substitution pattern with two different substituents, which would give a characteristic AA'BB' system, often appearing as two distinct signals (doublets).\n    *   *Protons accounted for:* **4 H** (aromatic)\n\n*   **Vinyl-H signals (2 signals, one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This splitting pattern is indicative of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) attached to the aromatic ring.\n    *   Let's label the carbons: Ring-CH(A)=CH(B)-CH3(C).\n    *   H(B) is split by H(A) (a doublet) and by the three protons of the methyl group (a quartet), resulting in a **doublet of quartets**.\n    *   H(A) is only split by H(B), resulting in a **doublet**.\n    *   This fragment accounts for the two vinyl protons.\n    *   *Protons accounted for:* **2 H** (vinyl)\n\n*   **–CH3 group signals (2 signals):**\n    *   One of these signals corresponds to the methyl group in the propenyl fragment (-CH=CH-CH3). This methyl group is adjacent to a vinyl proton (H(B)), so its signal would be a doublet.\n    *   The other -CH3 signal must belong to the second substituent, the ester group. Since there are no adjacent protons, this would be a singlet.\n    *   These two methyl groups account for 2 * 3 = 6 protons.\n    *   *Protons accounted for:* **6 H** (methyl)\n\n*   **No –CH2 group signals:** This is a key constraint that eliminates many possibilities.\n\n**2. Sum the Hydrogens:**\n\nBy adding up the protons from all the identified fragments, we can determine the total number of hydrogens in the molecule.\nTotal H = 4 (aromatic) + 2 (vinyl) + 6 (methyl) = **12 H**\n\nNow, we can compare this with the options provided:\nA) C11H14O2 (14 H) - Incorrect.\nB) C12H14O2 (14 H) - Incorrect.\nC) C11H12O2 (12 H) - **Possible**.\nD) C12H12O2 (12 H) - **Possible**.\n\nThis analysis narrows the choice down to C or D.\n\n**3. Determine the Carbon Count:**\n\nLet's build the molecule's carbon skeleton based on the fragments we identified.\n*   **Di-substituted benzene ring:** This is a C6H4 fragment, so **6 Carbons**.\n*   **Propenyl group:** The -CH=CH-CH3 group has **3 Carbons**.\n*   **Ester group:** The FTIR shows an ester group (-COO-), which contains one C=O bond. The second methyl group must be part of this ester. There are two possibilities that fit the \"no -CH2\" rule:\n    1.  A methyl ester: -COOCH3. This contains **2 Carbons** (the carbonyl carbon and the methyl carbon).\n    2.  An acetate group attached via oxygen: -O-CO-CH3. This also contains **2 Carbons**.\nIn either case, this fragment contributes 2 carbons.\n\n**4. Sum the Carbons:**\n\nTotal C = 6 (ring) + 3 (propenyl) + 2 (ester fragment) = **11 C**\n\n**5. Final Identification:**\n\nThe molecule must have 11 carbons and 12 hydrogens. The only formula that matches this is **C11H12O2**. The two oxygens are from the ester group.\n\nTo confirm, let's check the degree of unsaturation (DoU) for C11H12O2:\nDoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\nOur proposed structure has:\n*   1 benzene ring = 4 DoU\n*   1 C=C double bond (in propenyl) = 1 DoU\n*   1 C=O double bond (in ester) = 1 DoU\n*   Total DoU = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\nThe calculated DoU matches the DoU derived from the structure, confirming our analysis.

This indicates a C6H4 benzene core with two substituents.\n    *   **FTIR:** An ester group is present. An ester functional group has the structure R-COO-R' and contains two oxygen atoms.\n    *   **1H NMR Spectrum (6 signals total):**\n        *   **2 signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4) has 4 aromatic protons. The fact that they appear as two signals is characteristic of certain substitution patterns, like para-substitution (which would give an AA'BB' system, often appearing as two distinct signals/doublets). Total H count from this part is 4.\n        *   **2 signals for vinyl-H (C=CH):** One signal is a doublet, and the other is a doublet of quartets. This splitting pattern is highly indicative of a propenyl group, specifically the `-CH=CH-CH3` fragment.\n            *   Let's label the protons: `Ring-C(Ha)=C(Hb)-CH3`.\n            *   Proton `Ha` is adjacent to one proton (`Hb`), so it would appear as a **doublet**. This matches the data.\n            *   Proton `Hb` is adjacent to one proton (`Ha`) and three equivalent protons of the methyl group. This coupling would split the signal into a **doublet of quartets**. This perfectly matches the data.\n            *   Therefore, one of the substituents contains a `-CH=CH-CH3` group. This fragment has 2 vinyl protons.\n        *   **2 signals for -CH3 groups:**\n            *   One of these methyl groups is the one from the propenyl fragment (`-CH=CH-CH3`). This methyl group is adjacent to the `Hb` vinyl proton, so it would appear as a doublet.\n            *   The second methyl group must be located elsewhere in the molecule. Given the presence of an ester and the constraint of \"no -CH2- groups\", the most likely position for this methyl is as the alkyl part of a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or the acetyl part of a phenyl acetate-type ester (`-O-CO-CH3`). In either case, this methyl group would be a singlet as it has no adjacent protons.\n            *   This confirms the presence of two distinct methyl groups.\n        *   **No -CH2 signals:** This is a key constraint that confirms our proposed fragments, as neither a propenyl group, a methyl ester group, nor a phenyl acetate-type group contain any `-CH2-` (methylene) units.\n\n2.  **Assemble the molecular structure from the fragments:**\n    *   **Core:** C6H4 (di-substituted benzene ring).\n    *   **Substituent 1:** `-CH=CH-CH3` (propenyl group).\n    *   **Substituent 2:** An ester group containing a methyl group, e.g., `-COOCH3` (methyl ester group).\n    *   Let's check if this structure (a propenyl methylbenzoate) fits all the data.\n        *   It is a di-substituted aromatic ring.\n        *   It contains an ester.\n        *   The NMR signals match perfectly (2 aromatic, 2 vinyl, 2 methyl).\n        *   It has no -CH2- groups.\n        *   The total number of 1H NMR signals would be 2 (aromatic) + 2 (vinyl) + 2 (methyl) = 6 signals. This matches the given information.\n\n3.  **Calculate the total number of protons:**\n    *   From the ring (C6H4): 4 H\n    *   From the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3): 1 + 1 + 3 = 5 H\n    *   From the methyl ester group (-COOCH3): 3 H\n    *   Total Hydrogen atoms = 4 + 5 + 3 = 12 H.\n    *   This immediately eliminates options with H14 (A and D).

So regardless of the exact isomer, the formula is the same.\n    *   The DBU for C11H12O2 is `11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6`. This is consistent with a benzene ring (4 DBUs), one C=C double bond (1 DBU), and one C=O double bond (1 DBU).\n    *   The formula C12H12O2 would have a DBU of 7. It is not possible to add another DBU (e.g., another ring or double bond) and an extra Carbon to our structure without violating the strict NMR rules provided.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to identify the correct chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Functional Groups and Core Structure:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This tells us we have a benzene ring with two things attached to it. The core formula for this part is `C6H4`. The ring itself accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (DBE).\n    *   **FTIR indicates an ester group:** The molecule contains a `-COO-` functional group. This accounts for the two oxygen atoms present in all the options and adds one more degree of unsaturation due to the `C=O` bond.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons (`C6H4`). These 4 protons giving two signals is very common, for example in a para-substituted ring where you would see two doublets. This confirms the `C6H4` fragment.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets):** This is highly informative about one of the substituents.\n        *   A \"quartet\" (`q`) splitting means a proton is adjacent to a `-CH3` group.\n        *   A \"doublet\" (`d`) splitting means a proton is adjacent to a single other proton.\n        *   Therefore, a \"doublet of quartets\" (`dq`) describes a proton (`Hb`) that is adjacent to both another single proton (`Ha`) and a `-CH3` group. The other vinyl proton (`Ha`) being a simple \"doublet\" confirms it's only adjacent to `Hb`.\n        *   This splitting pattern uniquely identifies a **propenyl group**: `(-CHa=CHb-CH3)`. This fragment has the formula `C3H5` and adds one more degree of unsaturation from the `C=C` bond.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:** We have identified one `-CH3` group as part of the propenyl substituent. The presence of a second `-CH3` signal means there is another, chemically distinct `-CH3` group elsewhere in the molecule.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a crucial piece of negative evidence. It rules out any ethyl (`-CH2CH3`), propyl (`-CH2CH2CH3`), or other groups containing a `CH2` moiety.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Formula:**\n    Let's collect all the mandatory pieces of the molecule we've identified from the spectra:\n    *   From the aromatic ring: `C6H4`\n    *   From the vinyl and one methyl signal: a propenyl group `C3H5` (`-CH=CH-CH3`)\n    *   From the second methyl signal: another `-CH3` group\n    *   From the ester functionality: a `-COO-` group, which contains one carbon (`C`) and two oxygens (`O2`).\n\n    Now, let's sum the atoms from these fragments to find the total molecular formula:\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from `C6H4`) + 3 (from `C3H5`) + 1 (from `-CH3`) + 1 (from `-COO-`) = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from `C6H4`) + 5 (from `C3H5`) + 3 (from `-CH3`) = **12**\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from `-COO-`) = **2**\n\n    The molecular formula is therefore **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Verify Against Other Options:**\n    *   **C11H12O2 (Our result):** Degrees of Unsaturation (DBE) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6. This matches our structural analysis (Ring=4 + C=O=1 + C=C=1 = 6 DBE). This is consistent.\n    *   **C11H14O2:** DBE = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 5. This is inconsistent with the presence of an aromatic ring, an ester, *and* a vinyl group, which requires 6 DBE.\n    *   **C12H14O2:** DBE = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 6. While the DBE is correct, to get from our required C11H12O2 structure to C12H14O2, one must add a `CH2` group. The NMR data explicitly states there are no `-CH2-` groups. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n    *   **C12H12O2:** DBE = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7. This would require an additional double bond or ring compared to the structure indicated by the spectra, which is not supported by the data.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only chemical formula that fits all the provided spectroscopic evidence is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the given information from the problem description:**\n\n*   **Structure:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This implies a benzene ring with two substituents, formula C6H4.\n*   **FTIR Spectroscopy:** An ester group (-COO-) is present. This accounts for the two oxygen atoms seen in all the chemical formula options.\n*   **1H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** For a di-substituted benzene ring, having only two signals for the four aromatic protons strongly suggests a symmetrical `para` (1,4) substitution pattern. An `ortho` or `meta` substitution would typically result in four distinct signals for the four aromatic protons. So, we have a `p-C6H4` group (4 hydrogens).\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is characteristic of a `-CH=CH-CH3` group.\n        *   The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and by the three methyl protons (creating a quartet), resulting in a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n        *   The other vinyl proton is only split by the first vinyl proton, resulting in a **doublet (d)**.\n        *   This fragment has the formula `C3H5` (2 vinyl-H + 3 methyl-H).\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:** One methyl signal comes from the `-CH=CH-CH3` group identified above. The second signal must correspond to another, chemically distinct methyl group somewhere else in the molecule.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a key constraint that eliminates any structures containing a methylene bridge or an ethyl group, for example.\n\n**2. Assemble the molecular fragments:**\n\nBased on the analysis, we have the following pieces of the molecule:\n*   A para-substituted benzene ring: **-C6H4-**\n*   An ester group: **-COO-**\n*   A propenyl group: **-CH=CH-CH3**\n*   A second, distinct methyl group: **-CH3**\n\n**3. Construct a valid chemical structure:**\n\nWe need to combine these fragments into a single molecule that respects all the given information. The molecule has two substituents on the benzene ring. Let's consider the possibilities for forming the ester and placing the substituents.\n\n*   **Possibility A: Methyl benzoate derivative**\n    *   One substituent on the ring is the propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`).\n    *   The other substituent is a methyl ester group (`-COO-CH3`). This uses the ester fragment and the second methyl group.\n    *   The resulting structure is **methyl p-propenylbenzoate**: `CH3-CH=CH-C6H4-COO-CH3`.\n    *   This structure fits all the data: it's para-substituted, has a propenyl group with the correct NMR signature, has two distinct methyl groups, and crucially, has no `-CH2-` groups.\n\n*   **Possibility B: Phenyl acetate derivative**\n    *   One substituent is the propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`).\n    *   The other substituent is an acetoxy group (`-O-CO-CH3`). This uses the ester and the second methyl group.\n    *   The resulting structure is **p-propenylphenyl acetate**: `CH3-CH=CH-C6H4-O-CO-CH3`.\n    *   This structure also fits all the given spectroscopic data.\n\n**4. Determine the Chemical Formula:**\n\nNow, let's calculate the chemical formula for the valid structures we've proposed. Both possibilities will lead to the same formula. We will use Possibility A for the calculation.\n\n*   **Carbon atoms (C):**\n    *   From the benzene ring (C6H4): 6\n    *   From the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3): 3\n    *   From the ester carbonyl group (-COO-): 1\n    *   From the ester methyl group (-OCH3): 1\n    *   **Total Carbons = 6 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 11**\n\n*   **Hydrogen atoms (H):**\n    *   From the aromatic ring (C6H4): 4\n    *   From the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3): 5\n    *   From the ester methyl group (-OCH3): 3\n    *   **Total Hydrogens = 4 + 5 + 3 = 12**\n\n*   **Oxygen atoms (O):**\n    *   From the ester group (-COO-): 2\n    *   **Total Oxygens = 2**\n\nCombining these, the chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**5. Conclusion:**\n\nThe derived chemical formula C11H12O2 matches one of the given options. Other options are incorrect. For example, C12H12O2 has an extra carbon which cannot be added without violating the NMR data, and C11H14O2/C12H14O2 have too many hydrogens, which would imply saturation of the C=C bond, contradicting the presence of vinyl-H signals.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Information Provided\n\n*   **Structure:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This typically refers to a benzene ring with two substituents, so we have a C6H4 core.\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** An absorption peak indicates an ester group (-COO-). This tells us the molecule contains at least two oxygen atoms.\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum:** The spectrum provides crucial details about the hydrogen environments in the molecule.\n    *   **Six signals total:** This indicates six chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4) has four aromatic protons. Having only two signals suggests a high degree of symmetry, which is characteristic of a **1,4-disubstitution (para)** pattern. In this pattern, there are two sets of two equivalent protons, leading to two signals (typically two doublets).\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (alkene protons):**\n        *   One signal is a **doublet (d)**.\n        *   The other is a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n        *   This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**. The vinyl proton adjacent to the other vinyl proton is split into a doublet. The other vinyl proton is split by both the adjacent vinyl proton (into a doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (into a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. This identifies one of the substituents as `-CH=CH-CH3`.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:**\n        *   One methyl signal comes from the propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`) identified above.\n        *   The second methyl signal must be part of the ester group. Common ester functionalities involving a methyl group are a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate (`-OCOCH3`). Both possibilities provide a second, distinct methyl signal.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a key constraint, ruling out structures containing ethyl, propyl, or allyl (`-CH2-CH=CH2`) groups.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (also known as double bond equivalents) can be calculated from the structural features:\n*   Benzene ring: Contains 1 ring and 3 double bonds = 4 DBE\n*   Ester group (-COO-): Contains one C=O double bond = 1 DBE\n*   Vinyl group (-CH=CH-): Contains one C=C double bond = 1 DBE\n\n**Total DBE from structure = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6**\n\nNow, let's calculate the DBE for each of the given chemical formulas using the formula: DBE = C + 1 - (H/2).\n*   A) C11H14O2: DBE = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 12 - 7 = 5\n*   B) C12H14O2: DBE = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 13 - 7 = 6\n*   C) C11H12O2: DBE = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6\n*   D) C12H12O2: DBE = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 13 - 6 = 7\n\nComparing the DBE values, we can immediately rule out options A and D, as their DBEs (5 and 7, respectively) do not match the required DBE of 6. This leaves C11H12O2 and C12H14O2 as possibilities.\n\n### 3. Assemble the Molecule and Determine the Formula\n\nWe can now build the molecule from the fragments identified from the spectroscopic data and sum the atoms to find the correct formula.\n\n*   **Fragment 1: Aromatic Ring**\n    *   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring has the formula **C6H4**.\n*   **Fragment 2: Vinyl Substituent**\n    *   The propenyl group that fits the NMR data is `-CH=CH-CH3`. As a substituent, it has the formula **-C3H5**. (1 vinyl H + 1 vinyl H + 3 methyl H = 5 H).\n*   **Fragment 3: Ester Substituent**\n    *   This substituent must contain the ester functionality (`-COO-`) and the second methyl group.\n    *   Option 1: Methyl ester group, `-COOCH3`. This has the formula **-C2H3O2**.\n    *   Option 2: Acetate group attached via oxygen, `-OCOCH3`. This also has the formula **-C2H3O2**.\n    *   Both these fragments are consistent with the \"no -CH2-\" rule.\n\nNow, let's combine the atoms from these fragments:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from -C3H5) + 2 (from -C2H3O2) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from -C3H5) + 3 (from -C2H3O2) = **12**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from the ester group) = **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\nThis formula is fully consistent with all the provided data: it corresponds to a plausible structure (e.g., methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate), matches the detailed NMR signals, contains an ester group, is di-substituted, has no -CH2- groups, and has the correct degree of unsaturation (DBE = 6).\n\nThe other possibility, C12H14O2, can be ruled out because it is impossible to construct a molecule with this formula that satisfies all the specific NMR constraints (particularly the fragments identified and the absence of -CH2- groups).\n\n### 4. Final Conclusion\n\nThe spectroscopic evidence strongly and uniquely points to the molecular formula C11H12O2.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 49:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the given information:**\n    *   **Structure:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This indicates a C6H4 benzene core.\n    *   **FTIR:** An ester group (-COO-) is present. This means the molecule contains 2 oxygen atoms. All options (C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2) are consistent with this.\n    *   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n        *   **Aromatic-H:** Two signals. For a di-substituted benzene ring, two signals typically imply a para-substitution pattern, where there are two sets of chemically equivalent protons. This would account for a total of 4 aromatic protons.\n        *   **Vinyl-H:** Two signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets). This is a very characteristic splitting pattern for a prop-1-en-yl group (-CH=CH-CH3). The vinyl proton adjacent to the ring is split only by the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet). The other vinyl proton is split by both the first vinyl proton (doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. This group contributes C3H5 to the formula and accounts for two vinyl protons and one methyl group.\n        *   **-CH3 Groups:** Two signals. One -CH3 group is from the prop-1-en-yl group identified above. The second -CH3 signal must belong to the ester functionality.\n        *   **No -CH2 Groups:** The molecule does not contain any methylene (-CH2) groups. This is a crucial constraint.\n\n2.  **Deduce the structure of the substituents:**\n    *   **Substituent 1:** Based on the vinyl-H signals, one substituent is a prop-1-en-yl group: `-CH=CH-CH3`. This has the formula C3H5.\n    *   **Substituent 2:** This must be an ester group and contain the second -CH3 group, but no -CH2 groups. The simplest possibilities are:\n        *   A methyl ester group: `-COOCH3`. This has the formula C2H3O2 and contains a methyl group with no methylene group.\n        *   An acetate group attached via oxygen: `-O-CO-CH3`. This also has the formula C2H3O2 and fits the criteria.\n\n3.  **Assemble a plausible molecular structure and determine its formula:**\n    Let's combine the parts:\n    *   Benzene core: C6H4\n    *   Substituent 1 (propenyl): C3H5\n    *   Substituent 2 (ester part): C2H3O2 (from either -COOCH3 or -O-CO-CH3)\n\n    Now, let's sum the atoms to find the total chemical formula:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5) + 2 (from C2H3O2) = 11 carbons.\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from C3H5) + 3 (from C2H3O2) = 12 hydrogens.\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from C2H3O2) = 2 oxygens.\n\n    The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**. This perfectly matches all the spectroscopic data. For example, methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate has this formula and fits every detail from the NMR spectrum.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the other options using the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    The DBE (also known as the index of hydrogen deficiency) can be calculated using the formula: `DBE = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    The expected DBE for our deduced structure is:\n    *   Benzene ring = 4 (1 ring + 3 double bonds)\n    *   Vinyl C=C double bond = 1\n    *   Ester C=O double bond = 1\n    *   **Total Expected DBE = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6**\n\n    Now let's calculate the DBE for each option provided:\n    *   A) C12H14O2: DBE = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 13 - 7 = 6. (DBE matches, but constructing a structure that fits the strict NMR data - particularly \"no CH2\" and only \"two CH3 signals\" - is not possible).\n    *   B) C11H14O2: DBE = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 12 - 7 = 5. (DBE is too low. It cannot account for a benzene ring, a C=C bond, and a C=O bond).\n    *   C) C12H12O2: DBE = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 13 - 6 = 7. (DBE is too high. This would require an additional ring or double bond, which is inconsistent with the NMR data).\n    *   D) C11H12O2: DBE = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6. (DBE matches perfectly).\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_dbe(formula):\n        \"\"\"Calculates the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) for a given chemical formula CxHyOz.\"\"\"\n        import re\n        parts = re.match(r'C(\\d+)H(\\d+)O(\\d+)', formula)\n        if not parts:\n            return f\"Invalid formula format: {formula}\"\n        C = int(parts.group(1))\n        H = int(parts.group(2))\n        dbe = C - (H / 2) + 1\n        return dbe\n\n    formulas = {\n        \"A\": \"C12H14O2\",\n        \"B\": \"C11H14O2\",\n        \"C\": \"C12H12O2\",\n        \"D\": \"C11H12O2\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"Expected DBE based on structure: Ring(4) + C=C(1) + C=O(1) = 6\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    for option, formula in formulas.items():\n        dbe = calculate_dbe(formula)\n        print(f\"Option {option}: {formula}, DBE = {int(dbe)}\")\n    ```\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The structural analysis points directly to the formula C11H12O2. The DBE calculation confirms that C11H12O2 (DBE=6) is a perfect fit, while options B (DBE=5) and C (DBE=7) are inconsistent with the required structural features. Although option A (C12H14O2) also has the correct DBE of 6, it is impossible to construct a molecule with this formula that also satisfies the very specific NMR constraints (di-substituted, no -CH2 groups, and exactly two -CH3 signals). Therefore, the only correct answer is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Skeleton:**\n    *   The compound is described as a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" This means we have a benzene ring (C6) with two other groups attached to it. Since it's di-substituted, there are four protons (4H) remaining on the ring.\n    *   The presence of a benzene ring contributes 4 degrees of unsaturation (DoU) to the molecule (1 for the ring, 3 for the double bonds).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Functional Groups from FTIR and NMR:**\n    *   **FTIR:** An absorption peak indicates an **ester group** (-COO-). An ester contains a carbonyl group (C=O), which adds 1 more degree of unsaturation.\n    *   **1H NMR - Vinyl Protons:** There are two signals for vinyl protons (hydrogens on a C=C double bond).\n        *   One signal is a **doublet (d)**, which means it's coupled to only one other proton.\n        *   The other signal is a **doublet of quartets (dq)**. This is a key piece of information. \"Doublet\" means coupling to one adjacent proton. \"Quartet\" means coupling to three equivalent adjacent protons, which is characteristic of a methyl (-CH3) group.\n        *   This splitting pattern (d and dq) is classic for a **propenyl group** (-CH=CH-CH3).\n            *   Let's denote it as -CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3.\n            *   H(a) is split by H(b) into a doublet.\n            *   H(b) is split by H(a) (doublet) and by the three protons of the -CH3 group (quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets.\n        *   So, we have a `-CH=CH-CH3` substituent. This contains a C=C double bond, which adds another degree of unsaturation. It also accounts for two vinyl protons and one methyl group.\n    *   **1H NMR - Methyl Protons:** The spectrum shows **two signals for -CH3 groups**.\n        *   We have already identified one -CH3 group as part of the propenyl substituent.\n        *   Therefore, there must be a second, chemically different -CH3 group somewhere else in the molecule.\n    *   **1H NMR - No -CH2 groups:** This is a crucial constraint. The final structure cannot contain any methylene (-CH2-) groups.\n    *   **1H NMR - Aromatic Protons:** There are **two signals for aromatic-H**. This is consistent with a di-substituted benzene ring (which has 4 aromatic protons), particularly a para (1,4) substitution pattern with two different substituents, which typically gives two doublets (two signals).\n\n3.  **Count the Hydrogens based on NMR signals:**\n    *   Aromatic protons: A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 H.\n    *   Vinyl protons: The -CH=CH- fragment has 2 H.\n    *   Methyl protons: There are two -CH3 groups, so 2 * 3 = 6 H.\n    *   Total number of hydrogens = 4 (aromatic) + 2 (vinyl) + 6 (methyl) = **12 H**.\n    *   This immediately eliminates options C (C12H14O2) and D (C11H14O2), as they have 14 hydrogens. We are left with A (C12H12O2) and B (C11H12O2).\n\n4.  **Assemble the Fragments and Count the Carbons:**\n    *   We have the following pieces of the molecule:\n        1.  A di-substituted benzene ring core: **C6H4**\n        2.  A propenyl group: **-CH=CH-CH3** (which is C3H5)\n        3.  An ester group (-COO-) that incorporates the second methyl group and has no -CH2- groups. The only simple possibilities are an acetate group (`-O-CO-CH3`) or a methyl ester group (`-CO-O-CH3`). Both of these fragments are **C2H3O2**.\n\n    *   Now, let's assemble these fragments. The two substituents on the C6H4 ring must be the propenyl group and the ester-containing group.\n    *   Let's sum the number of carbons from these identified fragments:\n        *   Carbons in the benzene ring: 6\n        *   Carbons in the propenyl group: 3\n        *   Carbons in the ester-methyl fragment (-OCOCH3 or -COOCH3): 2\n    *   Total number of carbons = 6 + 3 + 2 = **11 C**.\n\n5.  **Determine the Final Formula:**\n    *   Based on our analysis, the molecule contains 11 carbon atoms, 12 hydrogen atoms, and 2 oxygen atoms (from the ester group).\n    *   The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n6.  **Verify with Degrees of Unsaturation:**\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for C11H12O2: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**.\n    *   Let's count the DoU from our deduced structure: 4 (for the benzene ring) + 1 (for the C=C in the propenyl group) + 1 (for the C=O in the ester group) = **6**.\n    *   The DoU calculation matches our structural deduction, confirming that C11H12O2 is the correct formula.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\nThe user has confirmed the output of the previous code execution. The reasoning process is as follows:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Molecule Based on Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This means we start with a benzene ring (C6H6) and replace two hydrogens with substituents. This leaves us with a **C6H4** fragment.\n    *   **FTIR shows an ester group:** The ester functional group contains **-COO-**. This adds 1 Carbon and 2 Oxygens.\n    *   **1H NMR - Aromatic-H:** \"Two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\" is consistent with the C6H4 fragment, suggesting a symmetrical substitution like para- (1,4-) substitution.\n    *   **1H NMR - Vinyl-H:** This is the most informative part. We have two vinyl protons. One is a doublet, meaning it's coupled to just one other proton. The other is a doublet of quartets, meaning it's coupled to one proton (giving the doublet) and a group of three equivalent protons (giving the quartet). This classic pattern identifies a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**.\n        *   The proton on the carbon attached to the ring is split by the other vinyl proton into a doublet.\n        *   The other vinyl proton is split by the first vinyl proton (doublet) and the adjacent methyl group (quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets.\n        *   This propenyl group contributes **C3H5** (3 carbons, 5 hydrogens).\n    *   **1H NMR - –CH3 groups:** \"Two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups.\" We already identified one from the propenyl group. The second -CH3 group must be part of the ester. This gives us either a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate (-OCOCH3). Both possibilities contribute one methyl group. Let's take the methyl ester fragment for calculation: **-COOCH3**. This adds a C and a CH3 to the -COO- core identified from the FTIR. So this fragment is **C2H3O2**.\n    *   **1H NMR - No –CH2 groups:** The fragments we've identified (C6H4, -CH=CH-CH3, and -COOCH3) contain no -CH2- (methylene) groups, which perfectly matches this constraint.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Formula from the Fragments:**\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5) + 2 (from C2H3O2) = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from C3H5) + 3 (from C2H3O2) = **12**\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group C2H3O2) = **2**\n\n3.  **Final Molecular Formula:**\n    The derived molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Match with Options:**\n    Comparing C11H12O2 with the given options:\n    *   A) C11H14O2\n    *   B) C11H12O2\n    *   C) C12H12O2\n    *   D) C12H14O2\n\nThe calculated formula matches option B.

This strongly suggests a benzene ring (C6H6) where two hydrogen atoms are replaced by substituents, giving a C6H4 core.\n    *   **FTIR Spectroscopy:** An ester group is present. The general structure of an ester is R-COO-R', which contains a carbonyl group (C=O) and a C-O single bond.\n    *   **1H NMR Spectroscopy:** This is the most detailed information for structure elucidation.\n        *   **Six total signals:** Indicates six chemically distinct types of protons.\n        *   **Two aromatic-H signals:** For a di-substituted benzene ring, having only two signals for the four aromatic protons is characteristic of a *para* (1,4) substitution pattern, especially with two electronically different substituents. This accounts for 4 protons (C6**H4**).\n        *   **Two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This splitting pattern is a classic signature for a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) attached to a carbon with no hydrogens (like the aromatic ring). Let's denote the group as Ar-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3.\n            *   H(a) is split by H(b), resulting in a doublet. (1H)\n            *   H(b) is split by H(a) (a doublet) and by the three protons of the adjacent CH3 group (a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. (1H)\n            *   This confirms the presence of a **-CH=CH-CH3** group, which contains 1 vinyl H, 1 vinyl H, and 3 methyl H's.\n        *   **Two –CH3 group signals:** This means there are two non-equivalent methyl groups in the molecule. One is the methyl from the propenyl group (-CH=CH-**CH3**). The other must belong to the ester substituent.\n        *   **No –CH2 group signals:** This is a crucial piece of information that eliminates many possibilities, such as an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) or a propoxy group (-OCH2CH2CH3).\n\n2.  **Assemble the Structural Fragments:**\n    *   **Fragment 1:** A para-substituted benzene ring (**C6H4**).\n    *   **Fragment 2:** A propenyl group (**-C3H5**).\n    *   **Fragment 3:** An ester substituent that contains the second methyl group and has no -CH2- groups.

This formula is not among the choices.\n\n    *   **Case B:** The two substituents on the C6H4 ring are the propenyl group and the acetoxy group.\n        *   Molecule: Propenylphenyl acetate, CH3-CH=CH-C6H4-O-CO-CH3\n        *   Formula Calculation: C6H4 (ring) + C3H5 (propenyl) + C2H3O2 (acetoxy) = C(6+3+2) H(4+5+3) O2 = **C11H12O2**.\n        *   This formula matches option D.\n\n4.  **Verify the chosen structure and formula (C11H12O2):**\n    *   **Formula:** C11H12O2. This is option D.\n    *   **Consistency Check:** The proposed structure, propenylphenyl acetate, has a di-substituted aromatic ring, an ester group, no -CH2- groups, and fits the NMR data perfectly:\n        *   Two aromatic signals (para-substitution).\n        *   Two vinyl signals (doublet and doublet of quartets for the propenyl group).\n        *   Two methyl signals (a doublet from the propenyl group and a singlet from the acetate group).\n        *   Total of 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 signals.\n    *   The structure is fully consistent with all provided spectroscopic data.\n\n5.  **Evaluate Other Formula Options:**\n    *   **C11H14O2 and C12H12O2:** The Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) for these formulas does not match the required structural elements (a benzene ring, a C=C bond, and a C=O bond, requiring DBE=4+1+1=6).\n        *   DBE(C11H14O2) = 11 + 1 - 14/2 = 5. (Incorrect)\n        *   DBE(C12H12O2) = 12 + 1 - 12/2 = 7. (Incorrect)\n    *   **C12H14O2:** The DBE is 6, which is consistent. However, to get this formula from the known fragments (C6H4, C3H5, an ester with a CH3, no CH2), we would need to add CH2. For instance, `p-propenylphenyl propionate`, (CH3CH=CH)-C6H4-O-CO-**CH2**CH3. This structure contains a -CH2- group, which contradicts the given NMR data. It's not possible to construct an isomer of C12H14O2 that fits all the NMR constraints.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only formula that allows for a structure perfectly matching all the spectroscopic data is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning used to identify the chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Structure:** The compound is described as a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means it is a derivative of benzene (C6H6) where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by other groups. The core of this molecule is therefore a C6H4 ring.\n\n2.  **Interpret the FTIR Spectrum:** The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of an ester group (-COO-). This functional group contains two oxygen atoms, so the molecular formula must end in O2. All the given options (C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2) are consistent with this.\n\n3.  **Interpret the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (C6H4-H):** There are two signals for the aromatic protons. A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons. The presence of only two signals implies symmetry, which strongly suggests a **para (1,4) substitution pattern**. In a para-substituted ring, the four protons are chemically equivalent in two pairs, giving rise to two signals.\n    *   **Vinyl Protons (-CH=CH-):** There are two signals for vinyl protons. One is a doublet (d) and the other is a doublet of quartets (dq). This specific splitting pattern is characteristic of a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**.\n        *   The vinyl proton attached to the ring is split only by the other vinyl proton, appearing as a doublet.\n        *   The second vinyl proton is split by the first vinyl proton (a doublet) and the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets.\n        This confirms one substituent is a propenyl group, which has the formula **-C3H5**.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-CH3):** There are two signals for -CH3 groups. One of these methyl groups belongs to the propenyl substituent identified above. The other methyl group must belong to the ester substituent.\n    *   **Absence of -CH2- Protons:** The spectrum shows no signals for methylene (-CH2-) groups. This provides a crucial clue about the structure of the ester. For an ester group not to contain a -CH2- unit, it must be a **methyl ester (-COOCH3)** or an **acetate group attached via the oxygen atom (-O-COCH3)**. In either case, the ester substituent's formula is **-C2H3O2**.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Molecular Formula:**\n    Now, we sum the atoms from all the identified parts of the molecule:\n    *   Benzene ring core: C6H4\n    *   Propenyl substituent: C3H5\n    *   Ester substituent: C2H3O2\n\n    Total atoms:\n    *   Carbon (C): 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n    *   Oxygen (O): 0 + 0 + 2 = 2\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n5.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated formula C11H12O2 matches option C.\n\nThe Python code confirmed this calculation:\n```\nThe chemical formula is C11H12O2\n```\nThis confirms that the deduced structure, Methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate, is consistent with the spectral data and leads to the formula C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\nThe analysis of the spectroscopic data provides a clear path to the correct chemical formula.\n\n**1.  Breaking Down the 1H NMR Data:**\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with two signals for aromatic-H:** This strongly suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern on a benzene ring, most likely para (1,4) substitution. This accounts for the `C6H4` part of the molecule (4 hydrogens).\n*   **Two signals for vinyl-H and one signal for a -CH3 group with characteristic splitting (doublet and doublet of quartets):** This is a classic signature for a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`) attached to the ring. This substituent adds 3 carbons and 5 hydrogens to the count.\n*   **One more signal for a -CH3 group:** The second substituent is an ester (from FTIR). The fact that there are no -CH2- signals means it cannot be an ethyl ester (`-COOCH2CH3`). The simplest option consistent with the data is a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`), which has a methyl group. This substituent adds 2 carbons (one from `C=O`, one from `-CH3`) and 3 hydrogens.\n*   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a critical piece of information that eliminates any possibility of having ethyl or longer alkyl chains as part of the structure.\n\n**2.  Counting the Atoms:**\n\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from benzene ring) + 3 (from propenyl group) + 1 (from ester C=O) + 1 (from ester -CH3) = **11 carbons**.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from aromatic ring) + 5 (from propenyl group) + 3 (from ester -CH3) = **12 hydrogens**.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from the ester group -COO-).\n\nThis count leads to the molecular formula **C11H12O2**.\n\n**3.  Verification with Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n\n*   **DBE from Structure:** 1 benzene ring (4 DBE) + 1 C=C double bond (1 DBE) + 1 C=O double bond (1 DBE) = **6 DBE**.\n*   **DBE from Formula Options:**\n    *   A) C11H14O2: DBE = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 5 (Incorrect)\n    *   B) C11H12O2: DBE = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6 (**Correct**)\n    *   C) C12H14O2: DBE = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 6. While the DBE is correct, this formula has an extra `CH2` group compared to C11H12O2, which is contradicted by the NMR data. (Incorrect)\n    *   D) C12H12O2: DBE = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 (Incorrect)\n\nThe only formula that perfectly matches all the spectroscopic data is C11H12O2. The code execution correctly confirmed this analysis.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 55:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the basic structural information:**\n    *   The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means it is based on a benzene ring with two substituents, with a core formula of C6H4.\n    *   The FTIR spectrum indicates an ester group (-COO-). This accounts for the two oxygen atoms present in all the given formula options.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the 1H NMR data:** The 1H NMR spectrum gives us the most detailed clues about the hydrogen environments in the molecule.\n    *   **Aromatic-H (two signals):** A di-substituted benzene ring can have ortho (1,2-), meta (1,3-), or para (1,4-) substitution.\n        *   For different substituents, ortho and meta patterns would typically result in four distinct signals for the four aromatic protons.\n        *   A para (1,4-) substitution pattern, due to its symmetry, results in only two distinct types of aromatic protons. Each signal would represent two equivalent protons, typically appearing as a doublet. Therefore, the \"two signals\" strongly suggest a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. These four protons (4H) are part of the C6H4 core.\n\n    *   **–CH2 groups (no signals):** The problem explicitly states there are no signals for –CH2– groups. This is a crucial piece of information. The ester group could be a methyl ester (-COOCH3), an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3), a propyl ester (-COOCH2CH2CH3), etc. The absence of a –CH2– signal rules out ethyl and propyl esters, leaving **methyl ester (-COOCH3)** as the most likely candidate. This fragment accounts for one of the two methyl signals.\n\n    *   **Vinyl-H (two signals: one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** Vinyl protons are hydrogens attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (-CH=CH-). The specific splitting pattern provided is very informative.\n        *   A \"doublet of quartets\" (dq) means a proton is coupled to one adjacent proton (giving the doublet) and to a group of three equivalent protons (giving the quartet).\n        *   A \"doublet\" (d) means a proton is coupled to only one adjacent proton.\n        *   This pattern is characteristic of a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**. Let's label the protons: -CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3.\n            *   Proton H(a) is coupled to H(b), so its signal is a **doublet**.\n            *   Proton H(b) is coupled to H(a) (a doublet) and also to the three protons of the CH3 group (a quartet). Therefore, its signal is a **doublet of quartets**.\n        *   This matches the data perfectly. This propenyl group fragment has the formula -C3H5.\n\n    *   **–CH3 groups (two signals):** We have accounted for both methyl groups now.\n        *   One is the methyl group of the methyl ester (-COOCH3). This would be a singlet signal as it has no adjacent protons.\n        *   The other is the methyl group of the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3). This signal would be a doublet, as it is coupled to the adjacent vinyl proton, H(b).\n\n3.  **Assemble the structure and determine the formula:** Based on the analysis above, the unknown compound is composed of:\n    *   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring core: C6H4\n    *   Substituent 1: A methyl ester group, -COOCH3 (Formula fragment: C2O2H3)\n    *   Substituent 2: A propenyl group, -CH=CH-CH3 (Formula fragment: C3H5)\n\n    The full structure is **methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the total chemical formula:**\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from ring) + 2 (from ester) + 3 (from propenyl) = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from ring) + 3 (from ester) + 5 (from propenyl) = **12**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from ester) = **2**\n\n    The final chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n5.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    A) C11H12O2\n    B) C12H14O2\n    C) C11H14O2\n    D) C12H12O2\n\n    The calculated formula C11H12O2 matches option A. We can also confirm that the other options are incorrect. For instance, C12H14O2 would likely be ethyl 4-propylbenzoate or a similar isomer, which would either lack vinyl protons or contain a -CH2- group, both contradicting the data.\n\nTherefore, the chemical formula of the unknown compound is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\nThe user wants me to identify the correct chemical formula from a list of options based on spectroscopic data.\n\n**My reasoning process:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the clues from the problem statement.**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells me the core of the molecule is a benzene ring (C6) with two substituents. The aromatic part of the formula will be C6H4. The ring itself accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (DBE: 1 for the ring and 3 for the double bonds).\n    *   **\"FTIR ... shows an ester group\"**: An ester group is -COO-. This adds a C=O double bond, which is one more degree of unsaturation. It also adds two oxygen atoms to the formula.\n    *   **\"1H NMR spectrum shows six signals\"**: This describes the different proton environments in the molecule.\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\"**: A di-substituted benzene ring with 4 protons that give only two signals strongly suggests a *para* (1,4) substitution pattern due to its symmetry.\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\"**: Vinyl protons are hydrogens attached to a C=C double bond. This splitting pattern (d, dq) is classic for a **propenyl group**, specifically `R-CH=CH-CH3`.\n        *   The H on the carbon next to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl-H (making it a doublet) and by the three methyl protons (making each peak of the doublet a quartet). Hence, a doublet of quartets.\n        *   The other vinyl H is only split by the adjacent vinyl H, so it appears as a doublet.\n        *   This propenyl group `(-CH=CH-CH3)` adds 1 C=C double bond (1 DBE), 3 carbons, and 5 hydrogens. It also accounts for one of the two `-CH3` signals.\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups\"**: We've already accounted for one `–CH3` group in the propenyl substituent. The second `–CH3` group must be part of the ester.\n    *   **\"no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups\"**: This is a crucial constraint. An ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) would have a -CH2- group, so that's not possible. The ester must be either a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate (-OOCCH3) to satisfy the \"no -CH2-\" and \"two -CH3\" rules. Both of these fragments add a `–CH3` group without a `–CH2` group.\n\n2.  **Assemble the pieces to determine the molecular formula.**\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** C6H4\n    *   **Substituent 1 (Propenyl):** -CH=CH-CH3 -> C3H5\n    *   **Substituent 2 (Ester with a Methyl):** -COOCH3 (methyl ester) or -OOCCH3 (acetate). In both cases, this piece contributes C2H3O2 to the total formula.\n    *   **Total Formula Calculation:**\n        *   Carbon (C): 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n        *   Hydrogen (H): 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n        *   Oxygen (O): **2**\n    *   The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n3.  **Verify the result using the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE).**\n    *   The general formula for DBE is `C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *   DBE for our deduced formula C11H12O2: `11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6`.\n    *   Let's check if this matches our structural analysis:\n        *   Benzene ring = 4 DBE\n        *   C=C in the propenyl group = 1 DBE\n        *   C=O in the ester group = 1 DBE\n        *   Total expected DBE = 4 + 1 + 1 = **6**.\n    *   The DBE matches perfectly.\n\n4.  **Compare with the given options.**\n    *   A) C12H12O2\n    *   B) C12H14O2\n    *   C) **C11H12O2**\n    *   D) C11H14O2\n    *   Our deduced formula, C11H12O2, matches option C.\n\nThe Python code was used to confirm the DBE calculation for all options, reinforcing the conclusion that C11H12O2 has the correct number of rings and pi bonds to match the structural fragments identified from the NMR and IR data.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\nThe user has not asked a new question. The previous interaction involved solving a problem to identify the chemical formula of a compound based on its spectral data. The provided \"Code output\" and \"Errors\" fields are empty, but they refer to the code that was run in the previous step.\n\nThe previous reasoning process was as follows:\n1.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) Calculation:**\n    *   The structure contains a benzene ring (DoU=4), a C=O bond (DoU=1), and a C=C bond (DoU=1). Total required DoU = 6.\n    *   The DoU for the options were calculated:\n        *   C12H14O2: DoU = 6\n        *   C11H14O2: DoU = 5\n        *   C11H12O2: DoU = 6\n        *   C12H12O2: DoU = 7\n    *   This eliminated options B and D, leaving A and C as possibilities.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectral Analysis:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Two signals for aromatic protons on a di-substituted ring imply a para (1,4) substitution pattern (`C6H4` fragment).\n    *   **Vinyl:** A doublet and a doublet of quartets indicate a `–CH=CH–CH3` (propenyl) group. This fragment is `C3H5`.\n    *   **Alkyl:** Two –CH3 signals and no –CH2 signals. One –CH3 is from the propenyl group. The other must be part of the ester, suggesting a methyl ester (`–COOCH3`) or an acetate (`–OCOCH3`). The methyl ester fragment is `C2O2H3`.\n\n3.  **Structure Assembly and Formula Determination:**\n    *   Assembling the most likely fragments: `C6H4` (ring) + `C3H5` (propenyl group) + `C2H3O2` (methyl ester group).\n    *   Summing the atoms:\n        *   Carbon: 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n        *   Hydrogen: 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n        *   Oxygen: 2\n    *   This leads to the formula `C11H12O2`.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   The derived formula `C11H12O2` matches option C and has the correct DoU of 6.\n    *   Option A, `C12H14O2`, differs by a `CH2` group. Since the NMR spectrum explicitly shows no `–CH2` signals, this option is incorrect.\n    *   Therefore, the only formula consistent with all the data is `C11H12O2`.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\nHere is my reasoning and thinking process to identify the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the given information:**\n    *   **Structure type:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This strongly implies a benzene ring with two substituents (C6H4). The \"di-substituted\" nature means there are 4 protons on the aromatic ring.\n    *   **FTIR Data:** An absorption peak for an ester group (-COO-). This tells us the molecule contains at least one C=O bond and an ether-like linkage. An ester group contributes C and O2 to the formula.\n    *   **1H NMR Data:** There are a total of six signals. Let's break them down:\n        *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A benzene ring with two substituents has 4 aromatic protons. Having only two signals for these 4 protons suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely a para- (1,4) substitution, which makes the protons chemically equivalent in two pairs.\n        *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** Vinyl hydrogens are protons attached to a C=C double bond. This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) attached to a group that does not cause further major splitting (like an aromatic ring).\n            *   Let's label the protons: Ring-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3.\n            *   The signal for H(a) is split by H(b) into a **doublet**.\n            *   The signal for H(b) is split by H(a) into a doublet, and this doublet is further split by the three protons of the adjacent -CH3 group into a quartet. The resulting signal is a **doublet of quartets**.\n            *   This confirms the presence of a -CH=CH-CH3 fragment.\n        *   **Two signals for -CH3 groups:** There are two chemically different methyl groups in the molecule. One is from the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3). The other must be part of the second substituent.\n        *   **No signals for -CH2 groups:** This is a crucial piece of information that eliminates many possible structures.\n\n2.  **Assemble the molecular fragments:**\n    *   We have a para-substituted benzene ring (C6H4).\n    *   One substituent is a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3). Its formula is C3H5.\n    *   The other substituent must contain the ester group (-COO-) and the second methyl group (-CH3). To form a stable substituent containing these pieces without a -CH2- group, there are two common possibilities:\n        *   **Possibility A:** The substituent is a methyl ester group, -COOCH3. The benzene ring is attached to the carbonyl carbon.\n        *   **Possibility B:** The substituent is an acetoxy group, -O-CO-CH3. The benzene ring is attached to the oxygen atom.\n\n3.  **Construct the full structure and determine the molecular formula:**\n\n    *   **Based on Possibility A:** The molecule is methyl 4-(1-propenyl)benzoate.\n        *   Structure: CH3-CH=CH-C6H4-COOCH3\n        *   Let's count the atoms:\n            *   Carbon (C): 6 (from the ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from methyl ester) = 11\n            *   Hydrogen (H): 4 (from the ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from methyl ester) = 12\n            *   Oxygen (O): 2 (from the ester)\n        *   The molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n    *   **Based on Possibility B:** The molecule is 4-(1-propenyl)phenyl acetate.\n        *   Structure: CH3-CH=CH-C6H4-O-CO-CH3\n        *   Let's count the atoms:\n            *   Carbon (C): 6 (from the ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from acetate) = 11\n            *   Hydrogen (H): 4 (from the ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from acetate) = 12\n            *   Oxygen (O): 2 (from the ester)\n        *   The molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n    Both plausible structures that fit all the spectroscopic data lead to the same molecular formula: C11H12O2.\n\n4.  **Verify the result by checking the other options:**\n\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) Calculation:** DoU = C + 1 - H/2.\n    *   **For C11H12O2:** DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6. This is consistent with a benzene ring (DoU=4), one C=C bond (DoU=1), and one C=O bond (DoU=1). (4+1+1 = 6). This fits our proposed structure perfectly.\n    *   **For C11H14O2:** DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 5. This DoU implies there is no C=C bond if a benzene ring and an ester group are present, which contradicts the NMR data showing vinyl protons. So, this option is incorrect.\n    *   **For C12H12O2:** DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7. This DoU would require an additional ring or double bond compared to the features identified from the spectra. It's not possible to create a structure with this formula that matches all the NMR data. So, this option is incorrect.\n    *   **For C12H14O2:** DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 6. The DoU is consistent. However, if we try to build a molecule with this formula using the fragments identified (-CH=CH-CH3, C6H4, -COO-, a second -CH3), we find that a -CH2- group must be present, which contradicts the \"no –CH2 groups\" information from the NMR. So, this option is also incorrect.\n\nBased on the thorough analysis of the provided spectral data, the only possible chemical formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 59:\nHere's my thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Provided Information:**\n    *   **Core Structure:** \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This means we have a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two substituents.\n    *   **Functional Group:** \"FTIR spectrum... shows... an ester group\". This tells us the molecule contains a -COO- functional group. An ester has the general formula R-COO-R'.\n    *   **Proton NMR (¹H NMR) Data:** This is the most detailed piece of information.\n        *   **Total Signals:** Six signals.\n        *   **Aromatic Protons:** \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\". A di-substituted benzene ring (C₆H₄) has 4 protons. Having only two signals for these 4 protons strongly suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, specifically para (1,4) substitution, where the two substituents are different. This gives an AA'BB' system, which often appears as two distinct signals (doublets).\n        *   **Vinyl Protons:** \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\". Vinyl protons are hydrogens attached to a C=C double bond. This splitting pattern (doublet and doublet of quartets) is a classic signature for a `-CH=CH-CH₃` group.\n            *   Let's label the group: Ar-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH₃(c).\n            *   H(b) is split by H(a) into a doublet, and then by the three H(c) protons into a quartet. This results in a doublet of quartets (dq).\n            *   H(a) is only split by H(b) into a doublet (d). This perfectly matches the description.\n        *   **Methyl Protons:** \"two signals corresponding to –CH₃ groups\".\n            *   One methyl group is the one from our proposed `-CH=CH-CH₃` (propenyl) group. Its protons (H(c)) are adjacent to one vinyl proton (H(b)), so they would appear as a doublet.\n            *   The second methyl group must be part of the ester, as there are no other places for it.\n        *   **Absence of Signals:** \"There are no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups\". This is a crucial negative constraint, ruling out many possibilities like ethyl esters (`-COOCH₂CH₃`) or longer alkyl chains.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Molecular Structure:**\n    *   We have a C₆H₄ ring.\n    *   We have a `-CH=CH-CH₃` group (propenyl group) as one substituent. This accounts for the vinyl signals and one of the methyl signals. Its formula is C₃H₅.\n    *   We have an ester group and the second methyl group. The \"no -CH₂-\" rule means the methyl must be directly attached to the ester functionality. This leaves two possibilities for how the ester is attached to the ring:\n        *   **Possibility A:** Methyl benzoate derivative. The ring is attached to the carbonyl carbon. The substituent is `-COOCH₃` (methyl ester). The methyl protons here would be a singlet, as they have no adjacent protons.\n        *   **Possibility B:** Phenyl acetate derivative. The ring is attached to the ester oxygen. The substituent is `-O-CO-CH₃` (acetoxy group). The methyl protons here would also be a singlet.\n    *   Both possibilities fit the NMR data:\n        *   2 aromatic signals (from the para-C₆H₄ ring).\n        *   2 vinyl signals (d and dq from the propenyl group).\n        *   2 methyl signals (one doublet from the propenyl group, one singlet from the ester methyl).\n        *   Total of 6 signals.\n        *   No -CH₂ groups.\n\n3.  **Determine the Chemical Formula:**\n    Now, let's calculate the molecular formula for the structure we've deduced. It doesn't matter which ester linkage (Possibility A or B) we use, as the total atoms will be the same. Let's build the formula from the pieces:\n    *   Benzene ring part: `C₆H₄`\n    *   Propenyl substituent: `C₃H₅`\n    *   Ester-methyl part: This consists of the remaining atoms: one methyl group (`CH₃`) and the ester atoms (`COO`). Total for this part: `C₂H₃O₂`.\n    *   Let's add them up:\n        *   Carbons (C): 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n        *   Hydrogens (H): 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n        *   Oxygens (O): 2\n    *   The resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n4.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) and Eliminate Other Options:**\n    The DBE (also called double bond equivalent) tells us the total number of rings and pi bonds.\n    *   DBE = C + 1 - (H/2)\n    *   **Expected DBE from structure:** A benzene ring has 4 DBE (1 ring + 3 π bonds). The vinyl C=C has 1 DBE. The ester C=O has 1 DBE. Total expected DBE = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n    *   **DBE of C₁₁H₁₂O₂:** 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6. This matches perfectly.\n    *   **Check the other options:**\n        *   `C₁₁H₁₄O₂`: DBE = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 12 - 7 = 5. This DBE is too low. It cannot have a benzene ring, a C=C bond, and a C=O bond simultaneously.\n        *   `C₁₂H₁₂O₂`: DBE = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 13 - 6 = 7. This DBE is too high. It would require an additional ring or π bond not accounted for by the spectral data.\n        *   `C₁₂H₁₄O₂`: DBE = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 13 - 7 = 6. While the DBE matches, this formula has a `CH₂` group more than `C₁₁H₁₂O₂`. The problem explicitly states there are **no -CH₂ groups**, so this formula is incorrect.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The only formula that is fully consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data (aromatic ring, ester, specific vinyl and methyl signals, and no CH₂ groups) and the rules of chemical structures (DBE) is C₁₁H₁₂O₂. The compound is likely methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate or 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)phenyl acetate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 60:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the 1H NMR data to determine the number of hydrogen atoms.**\n    *   **Aromatic Hydrogens:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. A benzene ring (C6H6) that is di-substituted has four remaining hydrogens on the ring (C6H4). The fact that there are \"two signals\" for these hydrogens suggests a symmetric substitution pattern, like 1,4- (para) substitution, where the four protons are chemically non-equivalent in two sets of two, giving two signals. Thus, we have 4 aromatic hydrogens.\n    *   **Vinyl Hydrogens:** There are \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H\". This means there are 2 vinyl hydrogens in the molecule. The splitting pattern (one doublet, one doublet of quartets) is a classic signature for a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) attached to a group without protons.\n    *   **Methyl Hydrogens:** There are \"two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups\". This means there are two distinct methyl groups. Each methyl group has 3 hydrogens, so the total number of methyl hydrogens is 2 * 3 = 6.\n    *   **Total Hydrogen Count:** We can sum the hydrogens from all parts of the molecule: 4 (aromatic) + 2 (vinyl) + 6 (methyl) = 12 hydrogens.\n    *   Based on the hydrogen count, the molecular formula must have H12. This eliminates options B (C11H14O2) and D (C12H14O2). The correct formula must be either A (C11H12O2) or C (C12H12O2).\n\n2.  **Analyze the functional groups and carbon skeleton to determine the number of carbon atoms.**\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** The 6-membered aromatic ring contributes 6 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Ester Group:** The FTIR spectrum indicates an ester group (-COO-). The carbonyl carbon (C=O) of the ester contributes 1 carbon atom.\n    *   **Vinyl Group:** The two vinyl hydrogens must be attached to two separate carbon atoms in a double bond (-CH=CH-). This contributes 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Methyl Groups:** The two methyl groups (-CH3) contribute 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Total Carbon Count:** Summing the carbons from these identified fragments gives a minimum number of carbons: 6 (ring) + 1 (ester carbonyl) + 2 (vinyl) + 2 (methyl) = 11 carbon atoms.\n\n3.  **Determine the number of oxygen atoms.**\n    *   The ester functional group (-COO-) contains 2 oxygen atoms.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Molecular Formula and conclude.**\n    *   Based on the analysis, the molecule contains 11 carbons, 12 hydrogens, and 2 oxygens.\n    *   The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n    *   This formula is fully consistent with the data. For example, a plausible structure is `methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate` or `p-tolyl crotonate`. Both have the formula C11H12O2 and fit all the spectral data described (di-substituted aromatic ring, ester, two vinyl protons with d/dq splitting, two distinct methyl groups, and no CH2 groups).\n    *   The formula C12H12O2 would require an additional carbon atom with no attached protons (a quaternary carbon), as the hydrogen count is fixed at 12. Inserting such a carbon into a plausible structure while remaining consistent with all the NMR data (especially the splitting patterns) is not feasible. For example, altering the propenyl group to include a quaternary carbon would change the number of vinyl protons or their splitting patterns.\n\nTherefore, the only logical choice is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>.",

    "Here is a detailed reasoning analysis of the problem, synthesizing the most consistent points from the provided answers.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data into Molecular Fragments:**\n\nAll provided reasoning methods correctly analyze the spectral data to identify the constituent parts of the molecule.\n\n*   **FTIR - Ester Group:** The FTIR data confirms the presence of an ester functional group (`-COO-`). This accounts for the two oxygen atoms in the molecular formula and one degree of unsaturation (DBE) from the `C=O` bond.\n\n*   **¹H NMR - Core Structure:** The compound is described as a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This means the core is a benzene ring (`C6H6`) where two hydrogens have been replaced, leaving a `C6H4` fragment. The NMR spectrum shows \"two signals for aromatic-H,\" which is characteristic of a symmetrically substituted ring, most likely a 1,4-(para) pattern. This `C6H4` fragment has 6 carbons and 4 hydrogens. The ring itself contributes 4 DBE.\n\n*   **¹H NMR - Substituent 1 (from Vinyl Signals):** The spectrum shows two signals for vinyl protons with a highly specific splitting pattern: \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\". This is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`)**.\n    *   The proton adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (a doublet) and the methyl group's three protons (a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets (dq).\n    *   The other vinyl proton is only adjacent to the first one, resulting in a simple doublet (d).\n    *   This fragment has the formula `C3H5` (3 carbons, 5 hydrogens) and contributes one DBE from its `C=C` bond. It also accounts for one of the two `-CH3` signals.\n\n*   **¹H NMR - Substituent 2 (from Ester & Alkyl Signals):**\n    *   The spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups\". We have already identified one `-CH3` group in the propenyl substituent. The second must be part of the ester group.\n    *   A crucial piece of information is that there are \"no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups\". This eliminates possibilities like an ethyl ester (`-COOCH2CH3`). The second `-CH3` must be attached to the ester functionality without any intervening `-CH2-` groups. This leads to two main possibilities for the ester substituent: a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate group (`-O-CO-CH3`).\n    *   Both of these fragments have the same formula: **`C2H3O2`** (2 carbons, 3 hydrogens, 2 oxygens).\n\n**2. Assemble Fragments and Calculate the Molecular Formula:**\n\nAll methods correctly sum the atoms from the identified fragments:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from ester part) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from ester's methyl) = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from ester) = **2**\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**3. Verification and Elimination of Other Options:**\n\n*   **Proton Count:** The sum of protons from the NMR data is 4 (aromatic) + 2 (vinyl) + 3 (methyl 1) + 3 (methyl 2) = 12 hydrogens. This eliminates any formula with 14 hydrogens.\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The expected DBE from the identified structural features is 4 (aromatic ring) + 1 (`C=C` bond) + 1 (`C=O` bond) = 6.\n    *   Calculating the DBE for C11H12O2: DBE = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6. This is a perfect match.\n    *   The other formulas are inconsistent: C11H14O2 (DBE=5), C12H12O2 (DBE=7).\n    *   While C12H14O2 also has a DBE of 6, it differs from the derived structure by a `CH2` group. The explicit absence of `-CH2-` signals in the NMR spectrum definitively rules out this possibility.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThere is a universal consensus among all provided methods. The logical breakdown of the spectral data consistently and unambiguously leads to the identification of the molecular fragments, which, when assembled, result in the chemical formula **C11H12O2**. This is the only option that satisfies all constraints imposed by the FTIR and ¹H NMR spectra. Based on the options provided in the prompt, `C11H12O2` corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"

This means we start with a benzene ring (C6H6) and replace two hydrogens with substituents. The core of the molecule is therefore a C6H4 group.\n    *   The FTIR spectrum shows an ester group is present. The general formula for an ester is R-COO-R'. This group contains two oxygen atoms.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR spectrum data:**\n    *   **Two signals corresponding to aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons (C6H4). The presence of only two signals suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, likely a para (1,4) substitution, which would give two sets of chemically equivalent protons. This confirms the C6H4 fragment, contributing 6 carbons and 4 hydrogens.\n    *   **Two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets):** This splitting pattern is a classic indicator of a propenyl group, specifically `-CH=CH-CH3`, attached to another group (in this case, the aromatic ring).\n        *   Let's analyze the protons: `(Aryl)-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3`.\n        *   The proton `H(a)` is split by `H(b)` into a doublet.\n        *   The proton `H(b)` is split by `H(a)` (a doublet) and the three protons of the `-CH3` group (a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets (dq).\n        *   This confirms the presence of a `-CH=CH-CH3` fragment. This fragment contributes 3 carbons and (1+1+3) = 5 hydrogens.\n    *   **Two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups:** One methyl group is part of the propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`) we just identified. The second methyl group must belong to the ester substituent.\n    *   **No signals corresponding to –CH2 groups:** This is a critical piece of information. The ester group cannot be, for example, `-COOCH2CH3` or `-CH2COOCH3` as these would produce `-CH2-` signals. The only simple ester structure containing a methyl group and no methylene group is a methyl ester, `-COOCH3`. This fragment contributes 2 carbons, 3 hydrogens, and 2 oxygens.\n\n3.  **Assemble the molecular formula from the identified fragments:**\n    *   **Fragment 1 (Aromatic Ring):** C6H4\n    *   **Fragment 2 (Propenyl Group):** C3H5 (`-CH=CH-CH3`)\n    *   **Fragment 3 (Methyl Ester Group):** C2H3O2 (`-COOCH3`)\n\n4.  **Sum the atoms from all fragments:**\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from ester) = 11\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from ester) = 12\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 0 + 0 + 2 (from ester) = 2\n\n5.  **Final Molecular Formula:** The deduced formula is C11H12O2.\n\n6.  **Verify with the provided options:**\n    *   A) C11H14O2\n    *   B) C11H12O2\n    *   C) C12H12O2\n    *   D) C12H14O2\n    Our calculated formula, C11H12O2, matches option B. The python code execution also confirmed this calculation.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the structural information:**\n    *   The compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This means we start with a benzene ring that has two hydrogen atoms replaced by other groups. The core of this part of the molecule is C6H4. The 1H NMR spectrum shows two signals for aromatic protons, which is characteristic of a para (1,4) substitution pattern, where the four protons on the ring are chemically equivalent in two sets of two.\n\n2.  **Analyze the FTIR information:**\n    *   The FTIR spectrum shows an \"ester group\". An ester functional group has the general structure R-COO-R' and contains one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms (-COO-).\n\n3.  **Analyze the 1H NMR spectral data:**\n    *   **Six signals total:** This indicates six different types of protons in the molecule.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** As mentioned, this corresponds to the four protons on the C6H4 ring.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This is a very specific and informative splitting pattern. A \"doublet of quartets\" (dq) arises when a proton is split by one adjacent proton (giving a doublet) and also by three adjacent protons of a methyl group (giving a quartet). A \"doublet\" (d) arises when a proton is split by only one adjacent proton. This pattern strongly indicates the presence of a propenyl group: -CH=CH-CH3.\n        *   Let's label the protons: -CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3.\n        *   Proton H(b) is adjacent to H(a) and the -CH3 group. It will be split into a doublet by H(a) and a quartet by the -CH3 group, resulting in a **doublet of quartets**.\n        *   Proton H(a) is adjacent only to H(b). It will be split into a **doublet**.\n        *   This fragment perfectly matches the description. The formula for this propenyl group is C3H5 (2 vinyl H + 3 methyl H).\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:** We have identified one -CH3 group from the propenyl fragment. The second -CH3 signal must come from the other substituent.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a crucial constraint. It tells us that there are no methylene bridges in the molecule.\n\n4.  **Assemble the molecular fragments:**\n    *   We have a C6H4 ring.\n    *   We have a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) as one substituent.\n    *   The other substituent is an ester that must contain the second -CH3 group but no -CH2 groups. Let's consider the possibilities for an ester R-COO-R':\n        *   If the ester is attached to the ring through the carbonyl carbon (e.g., a substituted methyl benzoate), the R' part must be the methyl group to avoid a -CH2-. The substituent would be **-COOCH3**. This fragment contains one -CH3 group and no -CH2 groups. This fits.\n        *   If the ester is attached to the ring through the oxygen (e.g., a substituted phenyl acetate), the R part must be the methyl group to avoid a -CH2-. The substituent would be **-O-CO-CH3**. This fragment also contains one -CH3 group and no -CH2 groups. This also fits.\n    *   Both possibilities for the ester substituent have the same atomic composition: C2H3O2.\n\n5.  **Calculate the total molecular formula:**\n    *   Let's sum the atoms from the identified fragments:\n        *   Aromatic ring: C6H4\n        *   Propenyl substituent: C3H5 (-CH=CH-CH3)\n        *   Ester substituent: C2H3O2 (-COOCH3 or -OCOCH3)\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from ester) = 11\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from ester) = 12\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from ester)\n    *   The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n6.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   A) C11H14O2\n    *   B) C12H12O2\n    *   C) C12H14O2\n    *   D) C11H12O2\n    *   Our calculated formula, C11H12O2, matches option D. The other formulas are inconsistent with the spectral data. For example, C11H14O2 and C12H14O2 have more hydrogen atoms, which would imply fewer double bonds or rings, contradicting the presence of both an aromatic ring and a vinyl group. C12H12O2 has an extra carbon atom that cannot be accounted for without violating the \"no -CH2 groups\" or \"di-substituted\" rules.\n\nTherefore, based on a logical deduction from the provided spectroscopic information, the chemical formula of the compound is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Spectroscopic Data\n\nFirst, let's break down the information provided by each spectroscopic technique.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** The presence of absorption peaks for an ester group is noted. An ester functional group has the structure R-COO-R' and contains one carbonyl group (C=O) and two oxygen atoms. All the given formula options (C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2) contain two oxygen atoms, which is consistent with this finding.\n\n*   **Structure:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means it is a benzene ring (C6H6) where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by two substituent groups. The core of the molecule is therefore a C6H4 group, which has 4 aromatic protons.\n\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum:** This provides the most detailed information about the structure.\n    *   **Six signals:** This indicates there are six chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons. Having only two signals suggests a symmetric substitution pattern, such as para (1,4-substitution), which would give two signals (two doublets), each integrating to 2H. This is consistent with the C6H4 core.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** Vinyl protons are attached to a C=C double bond. This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a propenyl group, **-CH=CH-CH3**.\n        *   Let's label the protons: -CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3.\n        *   H(a) is split by H(b), resulting in a **doublet**.\n        *   H(b) is split by H(a) (a doublet) and the three protons of the -CH3 group (a quartet), resulting in a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n        *   This fragment contains one C=C double bond.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:**\n        *   One of these signals corresponds to the methyl group in the propenyl fragment (-CH=CH-CH3). This methyl group's signal is split by H(b), resulting in a doublet.\n        *   The second -CH3 signal must belong to the ester group. Since the problem states there are **no signals for -CH2 groups**, it cannot be part of an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3). Therefore, it must be a methyl group directly attached to the ester, either as a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate ester (-OOCCH3). In either case, this methyl group is isolated and would appear as a singlet.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a crucial piece of information that helps eliminate several possibilities.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation tells us the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\nFrom the spectral data, we can sum the expected DBE:\n*   Aromatic ring: 1 ring + 3 π-bonds = 4 DBE\n*   Vinyl group (C=C): 1 π-bond = 1 DBE\n*   Ester group (C=O): 1 π-bond = 1 DBE\n*   **Total required DBE = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6**\n\nNow, let's calculate the DBE for each of the given formulas using the formula: DBE = C - H/2 + 1 (for a compound with formula CxHyO2).\n\n*   **A) C12H12O2:** DBE = 12 - (12/2) + 1 = 12 - 6 + 1 = 7. (Incorrect)\n*   **B) C12H14O2:** DBE = 12 - (14/2) + 1 = 12 - 7 + 1 = 6. (Possible)\n*   **C) C11H14O2:** DBE = 11 - (14/2) + 1 = 11 - 7 + 1 = 5. (Incorrect)\n*   **D) C11H12O2:** DBE = 11 - (12/2) + 1 = 11 - 6 + 1 = 6. (Possible)\n\nThis analysis eliminates options A and C. We are left with C12H14O2 and C11H12O2.\n\n### 3. Assemble the Molecular Structure and Final Verification\n\nLet's build the molecule from the fragments we've identified from the NMR data:\n1.  A di-substituted benzene ring: **C6H4** (contributes 4H)\n2.  A propenyl group substituent: **-CH=CH-CH3** (contributes C3H5)\n3.  An ester substituent containing a methyl group, e.g., a methyl carboxylate group (**-COOCH3**, contributes C2H3O2) or an acetoxy group (**-OCOCH3**, contributes C2H3O2).\n\nLet's assemble these pieces and sum the atoms. For example, a possible structure is methyl 4-propenylbenzoate:\n*   **C atoms:** 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5) + 2 (from COOCH3) = **11 carbons**\n*   **H atoms:** 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from C3H5) + 3 (from COOCH3) = **12 hydrogens**\n*   **O atoms:** 2 (from COOCH3) = **2 oxygens**\n\nThe resulting formula is **C11H12O2**. This structure is fully consistent with all the provided data:\n*   It has the correct DBE of 6.\n*   It is a di-substituted aromatic ring.\n*   It has an ester group.\n*   It contains a propenyl group giving the characteristic vinyl signals.\n*   It has two distinct methyl groups.\n*   It contains no CH2 groups.\n*   The total proton count (12H) matches the formula.\n\nNow, let's consider the other possibility, **C12H14O2**.\n*   This formula has the correct DBE of 6.\n*   However, compared to C11H12O2, it has one extra carbon and two extra hydrogens (a \"CH2\" unit).\n*   To incorporate a CH2 unit into our proposed structure would create a -CH2- signal in the NMR spectrum.\n*   The problem explicitly states there are **no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups**.\n*   Furthermore, if we analyze the proton count for C12H14O2: Total H = 14. Aromatic H = 4. Vinyl H = 2. This leaves 14 - 4 - 2 = 8 protons. These 8 protons would have to be distributed among methyl groups (since CH2 is forbidden), which is impossible as 8 is not a multiple of 3.\n\nTherefore, the formula C12H14O2 is inconsistent with the NMR data.\n\nThe only formula that perfectly matches all the constraints from the FTIR and 1H NMR data is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Functional Groups from FTIR:** The problem states that the FTIR spectrum shows absorption peaks indicating an ester group. An ester group has the general formula R-COO-R' and contains two oxygen atoms. All the given options (C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2) have two oxygen atoms, which is consistent with this information.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum to Identify Structural Fragments and Proton Count:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. Two signals for the aromatic protons typically suggest a symmetrical substitution pattern, most commonly a 1,4- (para-) disubstituted benzene ring. A para-substituted ring has 4 aromatic protons (C6**H4**), which appear as two distinct signals (an AA'BB' system, often simplified to two doublets). Thus, we have **4 aromatic protons**.\n    *   **Vinyl-H (2 signals):** There are two signals for vinyl protons (protons on a C=C double bond). One is a doublet (d) and the other is a doublet of quartets (dq). This splitting pattern is highly characteristic of a propenyl group, **-CH=CH-CH3**.\n        *   The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and by the three protons of the methyl group (each peak of the doublet becomes a quartet). This results in a doublet of quartets (dq). This accounts for **1 vinyl proton**.\n        *   The other vinyl proton is split only by the first vinyl proton, resulting in a doublet (d). This accounts for the second **1 vinyl proton**.\n    *   **–CH3 Groups (2 signals):** There are two signals for methyl groups.\n        *   One of these signals corresponds to the methyl group in the propenyl fragment (-CH=CH-**CH3**), which accounts for **3 protons**.\n        *   The second methyl signal must come from the ester group. Since the problem states there are no –CH2 groups, the ester must be either a methyl ester (e.g., -COO**CH3**) or an acetate ester (e.g., -O-CO-**CH3**). Both contain a methyl group, which accounts for another **3 protons**.\n    *   **No –CH2 Groups:** This is a crucial piece of negative evidence. It confirms that there are no ethyl, propyl, or other alkyl chains containing a -CH2- unit.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms:**\n    Based on the NMR analysis, we can sum the number of protons in the molecule:\n    Total H = (Aromatic H) + (Vinyl H) + (Methyl H)\n    Total H = 4 + (1 + 1) + (3 + 3) = **12 hydrogens**.\n\n4.  **Eliminate Incorrect Options:**\n    The molecular formula must contain 12 hydrogen atoms. Let's look at the options:\n    A) C12H12O2 (12 H) - Possible\n    B) C11H14O2 (14 H) - **Eliminated**\n    C) C11H12O2 (12 H) - Possible\n    D) C12H14O2 (14 H) - **Eliminated**\n    We are now left with two choices: C12H12O2 and C11H12O2.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Number of Carbon Atoms:**\n    Now, let's assemble the fragments we've identified and count the carbon atoms:\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** A di-substituted benzene ring (**C6**H4) contributes **6 carbons**.\n    *   **Propenyl Group:** The -CH=CH-CH3 group contributes **3 carbons**.\n    *   **Ester Group:** The ester group containing a methyl group, either -**C**OO**C**H3 or -O**C**O**C**H3, contributes **2 carbons**.\n\n    Total C = (Ring C) + (Propenyl C) + (Ester C)\n    Total C = 6 + 3 + 2 = **11 carbons**.\n\n6.  **Determine the Final Chemical Formula:**\n    Based on our analysis, the molecule contains 11 carbon atoms, 12 hydrogen atoms, and 2 oxygen atoms.\n    The chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n7.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    The DBE for C11H12O2 is calculated as: DBE = C + 1 - H/2 = 11 + 1 - 12/2 = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    The proposed structure contains:\n    *   One benzene ring (4 DBEs)\n    *   One C=C double bond in the propenyl group (1 DBE)\n    *   One C=O double bond in the ester group (1 DBE)\n    Total DBE = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n    The calculated DBE matches the structural features deduced from the spectra, confirming our conclusion.\n\nComparing our result with the remaining options, C11H12O2 is the correct choice.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Structure:** The problem states the compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This means we start with a benzene ring (C6H6) that has two hydrogen atoms replaced by two substituent groups. The core of the molecule is therefore a C6H4 group.\n\n2.  **Identify the First Substituent (Ester Group):**\n    *   The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of an ester group, which has the general structure R-COO-R'.\n    *   The 1H NMR spectrum provides a crucial clue: \"There are no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups.\" This rules out common ester types like ethyl esters (-COOCH2CH3) or propyl esters, as they contain -CH2- groups.\n    *   The simplest ester that does not have a -CH2- group is a methyl ester (-COOCH3).\n    *   The presence of a methyl ester is consistent with the 1H NMR data, which shows \"two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups\". One of these signals would be from the methyl ester's -CH3 group.\n    *   So, the first substituent is a methyl ester group: **-COOCH3**. This fragment contains **2 carbons, 3 hydrogens, and 2 oxygens**.\n\n3.  **Identify the Second Substituent:**\n    *   We need to account for the remaining signals in the 1H NMR spectrum. We have already accounted for one -CH3 signal. The remaining signals are:\n        *   Two signals for aromatic-H (these are on the C6H4 ring itself).\n        *   Two signals for vinyl-H (protons on a C=C double bond).\n        *   One more signal for a -CH3 group.\n    *   The vinyl-H signals are described as \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\". This specific splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group, specifically **-CH=CH-CH3**.\n        *   Let's label the protons: Ar-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3(c).\n        *   The signal for H(b) is split by H(a) (a doublet) and by the three protons of the CH3(c) group (a quartet), resulting in a **doublet of quartets**.\n        *   The signal for H(a) is split only by H(b), resulting in a **doublet**.\n        *   The signal for the CH3(c) group is split by H(b), resulting in a doublet. This accounts for the second -CH3 signal.\n    *   This -CH=CH-CH3 group perfectly matches the NMR description. This fragment contains **3 carbons and 5 hydrogens**.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Formula:**\n    *   Now, we combine all the identified parts of the molecule:\n        *   Aromatic ring: **C6H4**\n        *   First substituent (methyl ester): **C2H3O2** (from -COOCH3)\n        *   Second substituent (propenyl group): **C3H5** (from -CH=CH-CH3)\n    *   Sum the atoms from all fragments to find the total molecular formula:\n        *   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 2 + 3 = 11\n        *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 3 + 5 = 12\n        *   **Oxygen (O):** 2\n    *   The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n5.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   The calculated formula, C11H12O2, matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Structure:** The problem states the compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This means we have a benzene ring (C6H6) where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by two substituent groups. The core of the molecule is therefore a C6H4 group.\n\n2.  **Interpret the 1H NMR Data for the Aromatic Ring:** The 1H NMR spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\". In a di-substituted benzene ring, having only two signals for the four aromatic protons is a strong indication of a symmetrical substitution pattern. Specifically, this points to **1,4- (para) substitution**. In a para-substituted ring, the four protons are chemically equivalent in two sets of two, leading to two signals (typically two doublets). So, we have a C6H4 core.\n\n3.  **Identify the First Substituent from NMR Data:** The spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\". This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)** attached to the ring.\n    *   Let's label the protons: `Ring-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3`.\n    *   The signal for proton H(b) is split by the adjacent vinyl proton H(a) into a **doublet**, and it's also split by the three protons of the -CH3 group into a **quartet**. This results in a **doublet of quartets**.\n    *   The signal for proton H(a) is split only by the adjacent vinyl proton H(b), resulting in a **doublet**.\n    *   This perfectly matches the description. This propenyl group has the formula **-C3H5**. It also accounts for one of the two -CH3 signals mentioned.\n\n4.  **Identify the Second Substituent from FTIR and NMR Data:**\n    *   The FTIR spectrum shows an **ester group (-COO-)**.\n    *   The 1H NMR spectrum shows a second **-CH3 signal** and, crucially, **no signals corresponding to -CH2 groups**.\n    *   We need to form a substituent that contains an ester group and a methyl group, but no methylene (-CH2-) groups. There are two possibilities for this substituent, which is attached to the C6H4 ring:\n        *   A methyl ester group: **-COOCH3**. This fragment contains the ester, a -CH3 group, and no -CH2 groups.\n        *   An acetoxy group: **-OCOCH3**. This fragment also contains the ester, a -CH3 group, and no -CH2 groups.\n    *   Both of these possible groups have the same chemical formula: **-C2H3O2**.\n\n5.  **Assemble the Molecular Formula:** Now we can sum the atoms from all the identified parts of the molecule to find the total chemical formula.\n    *   **From the para-substituted ring:** C6H4\n    *   **From the propenyl group:** C3H5\n    *   **From the ester-containing group:** C2H3O2\n\n    Let's add them up:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 0 + 0 + 2 = **2**\n\n    The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:** The calculated formula, C11H12O2, matches option A.\n\nLet's perform a final check using the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for C11H12O2:\n*   DoU = C + 1 - H/2 = 11 + 1 - 12/2 = 12 - 6 = 6.\nOur proposed structure contains:\n*   1 benzene ring (4 degrees of unsaturation)\n*   1 C=C double bond in the propenyl group (1 degree of unsaturation)\n*   1 C=O double bond in the ester group (1 degree of unsaturation)\n*   Total DoU = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\nThe calculated DoU matches the structure, confirming our analysis.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Functional Groups and Degrees of Unsaturation (DBE)**\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This is a benzene ring (C6H4). A benzene ring has 1 ring and 3 double bonds, which corresponds to 4 degrees of unsaturation (DBE).\n*   **FTIR shows an ester group:** An ester group has the structure R-COO-R'. It contains a carbonyl group (C=O), which corresponds to 1 DBE. It also accounts for the two oxygen atoms in the molecular formula.\n*   **1H NMR shows two vinyl-H signals:** Vinyl protons are protons attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). This C=C double bond corresponds to 1 DBE.\n*   **Total Expected DBE:** Summing the degrees of unsaturation from the identified functional groups: 4 (aromatic ring) + 1 (ester C=O) + 1 (vinyl C=C) = 6 DBE.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the DBE for Each of the Proposed Formulas**\n\nThe formula for calculating the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) for a molecule with formula CxHyOz is:\nDBE = x - y/2 + 1\n\nLet's calculate the DBE for each option:\n*   **A) C11H12O2:** DBE = 11 - (12/2) + 1 = 11 - 6 + 1 = 6. This **matches** our expected DBE.\n*   **B) C11H14O2:** DBE = 11 - (14/2) + 1 = 11 - 7 + 1 = 5. This does not match. A DBE of 5 would mean one of the double bonds (likely the vinyl C=C) is missing, which contradicts the NMR data.\n*   **C) C12H14O2:** DBE = 12 - (14/2) + 1 = 12 - 7 + 1 = 6. This **matches** our expected DBE.\n*   **D) C12H12O2:** DBE = 12 - (12/2) + 1 = 12 - 6 + 1 = 7. This does not match. A DBE of 7 implies an additional ring or double bond not accounted for by the provided spectral data.\n\nBased on the DBE calculation, we can eliminate options B and D. We are left with options A and C.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Proton Count from the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's determine the total number of hydrogen atoms (protons) in the molecule from the NMR data.\n*   **Two signals corresponding to aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 protons attached to it. So, this accounts for **4H**.\n*   **Two signals corresponding to vinyl-H:** This means there are two distinct protons on a C=C double bond. This accounts for **2H**. (The doublet and doublet of quartets pattern strongly suggests a -CH=CH-CH3 group).\n*   **Two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups:** This indicates two non-equivalent methyl groups. Each methyl group has 3 protons. So, this accounts for 2 * 3H = **6H**.\n*   **No signals corresponding to –CH2 groups:** This confirms the absence of methylene groups.\n\n**Total Proton Count:** 4H (aromatic) + 2H (vinyl) + 6H (methyl) = **12H**.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Proton Count with the Remaining Options**\n\nNow we compare this total proton count with the number of hydrogens in the remaining possible formulas:\n*   **A) C11H12O2:** This formula has **12 hydrogens**. This **matches** our calculated proton count.\n*   **C) C12H14O2:** This formula has **14 hydrogens**. This **does not match** our calculated proton count.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly the chemical formula **C11H12O2** is consistent with all the information provided:\n1.  It has the correct number of oxygen atoms (2) for an ester.\n2.  Its degree of unsaturation (DBE=6) matches the structural features (aromatic ring, ester C=O, vinyl C=C).\n3.  Its number of hydrogen atoms (12) matches the total proton count from the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\nA plausible structure that fits all the data is methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate, which has the formula C11H12O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nBased on the analysis, here is the final answer.\n\n**1. Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)**\n\nFrom the problem description, we can deduce the structural components:\n*   A 6-membered aromatic ring (benzene ring) has a DBE of 4 (1 ring + 3 double bonds).\n*   An ester group (-COO-) contains a C=O double bond, contributing 1 to the DBE.\n*   The presence of two vinyl-H signals indicates a C=C double bond, contributing another 1 to the DBE.\n\nTherefore, the total required Degree of Unsaturation for the molecule is 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n\n**2. Check the DBE for Each Option**\n\nThe python script calculated the DBE for each of the given chemical formulas:\n*   C11H14O2: DBE = 5\n*   C12H14O2: DBE = 6\n*   C12H12O2: DBE = 7\n*   C11H12O2: DBE = 6\n\nThis eliminates options A (C11H14O2) and C (C12H12O2) because their DBE values do not match the required DBE of 6. We are left with options B and D.\n\n**3. Analyze the 1H NMR Data to Differentiate Between B and D**\n\nLet's propose a structure that fits all the NMR data:\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with two signals:** This suggests a para (1,4) substitution pattern due to the symmetry, resulting in only two types of aromatic protons.\n*   **Two vinyl-H signals (doublet and doublet of quartets):** This is the classic splitting pattern for a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3).\n*   **Two -CH3 signals:** One methyl group is part of the propenyl group. The second methyl group must be part of the ester, indicating a methyl ester (-COOCH3).\n*   **No -CH2 signals:** This is a crucial piece of information.\n\nLet's assemble a structure with these pieces: a propenyl group and a methyl ester group on a benzene ring in the para position. The structure is **methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate**.\n\nLet's check the formula for this proposed structure:\n*   Carbons: 3 (from propenyl) + 6 (from ring) + 1 (from C=O) + 1 (from O-CH3) = 11 carbons.\n*   Hydrogens: 3 (from propenyl-CH3) + 1 (from vinyl) + 1 (from vinyl) + 4 (from ring) + 3 (from ester-CH3) = 12 hydrogens.\n*   Oxygens: 2 (from ester).\nThe chemical formula is **C11H12O2**. This structure has no -CH2- groups, which is consistent with the NMR data.\n\nNow, let's consider the other possibility, C12H14O2 (Option B). This formula has one extra carbon and two extra hydrogens (a -CH2- unit) compared to C11H12O2. A plausible structure would be **ethyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate**, which has an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3). However, this structure contains a -CH2- group, which would produce a signal in the 1H NMR spectrum. Since the problem explicitly states there are no signals for -CH2- groups, C12H14O2 is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the given information:**\n    *   **Structure:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This implies a `C6H4` core.\n    *   **FTIR:** An ester group (`-COO-`) is present. This accounts for the two oxygen atoms in all the proposed formulas. An ester group also contains a carbonyl (`C=O`) bond.\n    *   **1H NMR Spectrum:** This provides the most detailed information about the structure.\n        *   **Six total signals:** This means there are six chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n        *   **Two aromatic-H signals:** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons (`-C6H4-`). Two signals for these 4 protons strongly suggest a para-substitution pattern (1,4-disubstituted), where the protons are split into two groups of two, each appearing as a doublet (an AA'BB' system).\n        *   **Two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** Vinyl protons are attached to a `C=C` double bond. This specific splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`) attached to a group with no adjacent protons (like our aromatic ring).\n            *   Let's label the group as `Ar-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3`.\n            *   Proton `H(b)` is split by `H(a)` (into a doublet) and by the three protons of the `-CH3` group (into a quartet). The combined splitting results in a **doublet of quartets**.\n            *   Proton `H(a)` is split only by `H(b)` (into a **doublet**).\n            *   This confirms the presence of a `-CH=CH-CH3` group. This fragment has the formula `C3H5` and contains one of the two methyl groups.\n        *   **Two -CH3 group signals:** We have identified one `-CH3` group as part of the propenyl substituent. The second `-CH3` signal must belong to the ester group. This means the ester is either a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetoxy group (`-OCOCH3`).\n        *   **No -CH2 group signals:** This is a crucial piece of negative evidence. It rules out the presence of any ethyl, propyl, or other alkyl chains containing a methylene (`-CH2-`) unit.\n\n2.  **Assemble the molecular fragments:**\n    Based on the analysis, the molecule is composed of the following pieces:\n    *   A di-substituted benzene ring: `C6H4`\n    *   A propenyl group: `C3H5` (which contains two vinyl protons and one methyl group)\n    *   An ester functionality which must also contain the second methyl group. This can be either:\n        *   A methyl ester group: `-COOCH3` (formula `C2H3O2`)\n        *   An acetoxy group: `-OCOCH3` (formula `C2H3O2`)\n\n3.  **Calculate the total molecular formula:**\n    Let's sum the atoms from the identified fragments regardless of which type of ester it is.\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from `C6H4` ring) + 3 (from `C3H5` propenyl group) + 2 (from `C2H3O2` ester/methyl part) = **11 Carbons**\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from `C6H4` ring) + 5 (from `C3H5` propenyl group) + 3 (from the ester's `CH3` group) = **12 Hydrogens**\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group) = **2 Oxygens**\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   A) C12H14O2: Incorrect. This would require an additional `CH2` group, which is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data.\n    *   B) C11H14O2: Incorrect. This formula has two more hydrogens than our derived formula. This would imply the absence of the `C=C` double bond in the propenyl group (i.e., it would be a propyl group), contradicting the vinyl-H signals.\n    *   C) C12H12O2: Incorrect. This formula has an extra carbon compared to our derived structure. It is not possible to add a carbon atom without either adding hydrogens (which would change the formula to something else) or violating the \"no -CH2-\" rule.\n    *   D) C11H12O2: Correct. This formula perfectly matches the structure deduced from the spectroscopic data.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The detailed analysis of the FTIR and especially the 1H NMR data allows for the unambiguous assembly of the molecular fragments into a structure whose formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct chemical formula:\n\n**1. Analyze the Spectroscopic Data**\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This tells us the core of the molecule is a benzene ring (C6H4) with two groups attached. The formula of this fragment is C6H4.\n*   **FTIR shows an ester group:** The molecule contains a -COO- functional group. This accounts for the two oxygen atoms in all the proposed formulas. An ester group also contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **Six signals total:** This indicates six chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring can be ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4). For two different substituents, a para-substituted ring gives the simplest spectrum, often appearing as two distinct signals (two doublets, an AA'BB' system). This is the most likely pattern for only two aromatic signals.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This is a classic pattern for a `-CH=CH-CH3` group.\n        *   Let's call the protons `R-CHa=CHb-CH3`.\n        *   Proton Ha is adjacent to proton Hb, so it is split into a **doublet**.\n        *   Proton Hb is adjacent to proton Ha (1 proton) and the -CH3 group (3 protons). It is split into a doublet by Ha and a quartet by the -CH3 group, resulting in a **doublet of quartets**.\n        *   This confirms the presence of a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`), which has the formula C3H5.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:**\n        *   One -CH3 signal comes from the propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`) we just identified.\n        *   The second -CH3 signal must belong to the other substituent, which contains the ester group.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a crucial constraint. The molecule contains no methylene (`-CH2-`) groups. This rules out substituents like ethyl (`-CH2CH3`), propyl (`-CH2CH2CH3`), etc. The second methyl group must be directly attached to a part of the ester that has no other adjacent protons, for example, a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate group (`-OCOCH3`).\n\n**2. Assemble the Molecular Fragments**\n\nBased on the analysis, we have the following pieces:\n*   A para-substituted benzene ring: `C6H4`\n*   A propenyl group: `-CH=CH-CH3` (formula `C3H5`)\n*   An ester group containing a methyl group, with no CH2 groups. The two possibilities are:\n    *   A methyl ester group: `-COOCH3` (formula `C2H3O2`)\n    *   An acetate group attached to the ring via oxygen: `-OCOCH3` (formula `C2H3O2`)\n\nLet's combine these fragments to build the whole molecule and determine its formula.\n*   Carbons: `C6` (from ring) + `C3` (from propenyl) + `C2` (from ester part) = **C11**\n*   Hydrogens: `H4` (from ring) + `H5` (from propenyl) + `H3` (from methyl ester/acetate) = **H12**\n*   Oxygens: `O2` (from ester)\n\nThe assembled molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**3. Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)**\n\nThe DBE (or index of hydrogen deficiency) tells us the total number of rings and pi bonds.\n*   **From the structure:** Benzene ring (1 ring + 3 double bonds = 4 DBE) + C=C in propenyl group (1 DBE) + C=O in ester group (1 DBE) = **Total 6 DBE**.\n\nNow, let's calculate the DBE for each of the given options using the formula DBE = C + 1 - H/2:\n*   A) C11H14O2: DBE = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 12 - 7 = 5. (Incorrect, not enough unsaturation)\n*   B) C11H12O2: DBE = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6. (**Matches our structure**)\n*   C) C12H12O2: DBE = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 13 - 6 = 7. (Incorrect, requires an extra ring or double bond not indicated by the data)\n*   D) C12H14O2: DBE = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 13 - 7 = 6. (DBE matches, but this formula is C11H12O2 + CH2. Adding a CH2 group would create a -CH2- signal in the NMR, which is explicitly ruled out).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly the formula C11H12O2 is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic information. It has the correct degree of unsaturation, and a molecule with this formula can be constructed (e.g., methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate) that perfectly matches the described 1H NMR signals without containing any -CH2- groups.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the given information from the problem statement:**\n    *   **Structure:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring (a benzene ring with two groups attached).\n    *   **FTIR:** An ester group (-COO-) is present.\n    *   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n        *   Six signals in total.\n        *   Two signals for aromatic protons (Ar-H).\n        *   Two signals for vinyl protons (-CH=CH-). One is a doublet (d), and the other is a doublet of quartets (dq).\n        *   Two signals for methyl protons (-CH3).\n        *   No signals for methylene protons (-CH2-).\n\n2.  **Deduce the structural fragments from the spectroscopic data:**\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** A di-substituted benzene ring has the formula C6H4. The presence of only two signals for the four aromatic protons strongly suggests a para (1,4) substitution pattern, which has a plane of symmetry, making the protons at positions 2 and 6 equivalent, and the protons at 3 and 5 equivalent. This fragment contributes **C6H4** to the formula.\n    *   **Vinyl Group:** The signal patterns for the vinyl protons are very characteristic. A proton that is a doublet of quartets (dq) is coupled to one other proton (giving the doublet) and a group of three equivalent protons (giving the quartet). This fits a `-CH=CH-CH3` fragment. The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group would be the `dq`. The other vinyl proton would be coupled only to the first vinyl proton, resulting in a doublet (d). This fragment is a propenyl group. It contributes **C3H5** (`-CH=CH-CH3`) to the formula. This also accounts for one of the two -CH3 signals.\n    *   **Ester Group and Second Methyl Group:** The FTIR confirms an ester (-COO-). The NMR shows a second -CH3 signal. This methyl group must be part of the ester functional group. There are two common possibilities: a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetoxy group (`-OCOCH3`). Both possibilities contain one carbonyl carbon, two oxygen atoms, and one methyl group. This fragment contributes **C2H3O2** (`-COOCH3` or `-OCOCH3`) to the formula.\n    *   **Absence of -CH2-:** The explicit mention of no -CH2- signals confirms that our deduced fragments, which contain no -CH2- groups, are likely correct.\n\n3.  **Assemble the fragments and calculate the total molecular formula:**\n    The two substituents on the C6H4 ring are the propenyl group and the ester-containing group.\n    *   **Carbon atoms (C):** 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5 propenyl) + 2 (from C2H3O2 ester) = **11 carbons**.\n    *   **Hydrogen atoms (H):** 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from C3H5 propenyl) + 3 (from C2H3O2 ester) = **12 hydrogens**.\n    *   **Oxygen atoms (O):** 2 (from the ester group) = **2 oxygens**.\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Verify with the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    The DBE (also known as the index of hydrogen deficiency) can be calculated from the formula: DBE = C + 1 - H/2.\n    For C11H12O2: DBE = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**.\n\n    The DBE can also be calculated from the deduced structure:\n    *   Benzene ring = 1 ring + 3 double bonds = 4 DBE\n    *   Vinyl C=C double bond = 1 DBE\n    *   Ester C=O double bond = 1 DBE\n    *   Total DBE = 4 + 1 + 1 = **6**.\n    The calculated DBE from the formula matches the expected DBE from the structure, confirming our result.\n\n5.  **Compare the result with the given options:**\n    A) C11H14O2\n    B) C12H14O2\n    C) C11H12O2\n    D) C12H12O2\n\n    Our calculated formula, C11H12O2, matches option C. Let's briefly check why the other options are incorrect.\n    *   Options A and B have 14 hydrogens. Our analysis shows 12 hydrogens. Furthermore, option B (C12H14O2) contains an additional CH2 group compared to our derived structure (C11H12O2), which is contradicted by the \"no –CH2 groups\" information.\n    *   Option D (C12H12O2) has an extra carbon compared to our derived structure, and it would be impossible to add this carbon without violating one of the other spectral constraints.\n\nTherefore, the correct chemical formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Structural Information:**\n    *   The compound is a **di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring**. This indicates a benzene ring (C6H6) where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by two substituent groups. The core of this part of the molecule is therefore C6H4.\n    *   The FTIR spectrum shows an **ester group**, which has the functional group -COO-. This adds 1 carbon and 2 oxygen atoms to the formula.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:** The NMR spectrum gives us crucial information about the hydrogen environments and their connectivity.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons (C6H4). The fact that they appear as two signals suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely para-substitution (1,4-disubstituted), which would give two doublets. This confirms the C6H4 part of the structure.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This is a very characteristic splitting pattern. It strongly suggests a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) attached to the aromatic ring.\n        *   Let's label the group as Ar-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3.\n        *   The vinyl proton H(a) is split by H(b), resulting in a **doublet**.\n        *   The vinyl proton H(b) is split by H(a) (a doublet) and by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (a quartet). This combined splitting results in a **doublet of quartets**.\n        *   This fragment is -CH=CH-CH3 and contributes 3 carbons and 5 hydrogens.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:** We have identified two separate methyl groups in the structure.\n        *   One methyl group is part of the propenyl substituent (-CH=CH-CH3). Its signal would be a doublet, as it is split by the adjacent vinyl proton H(b).\n        *   The second methyl group must be part of the ester functionality. To give a separate signal (and be consistent with having no -CH2- groups), it is most likely a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate group attached via oxygen (-O-CO-CH3). In either case, this methyl group would be a singlet as it has no adjacent protons to couple with. This fragment contributes 1 carbon and 3 hydrogens.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a key constraint that eliminates many possibilities, such as ethyl esters (-COOCH2CH3) or propyl substituents (-CH2CH2CH3). Our proposed fragments (-CH=CH-CH3 and -COOCH3) adhere to this rule.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Molecular Fragments and Determine the Formula:**\n    Now, let's sum the atoms from all the identified fragments to find the molecular formula.\n    *   **From the aromatic ring:** C6H4\n    *   **From the propenyl group:** C3H5 (-CH=CH-CH3)\n    *   **From the ester group:** C1O2 (-COO-)\n    *   **From the second methyl group:** C1H3 (-CH3)\n\n    Let's combine them. A possible structure is Methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate.\n    *   Total Carbons (C): 6 (ring) + 3 (propenyl) + 1 (ester C=O) + 1 (ester CH3) = **11**\n    *   Total Hydrogens (H): 4 (ring) + 5 (propenyl) + 3 (ester CH3) = **12**\n    *   Total Oxygens (O): **2** (ester)\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    *   A) C12H14O2\n    *   B) C11H14O2\n    *   C) C11H12O2\n    *   D) C12H12O2\n\n    Our deduced formula, C11H12O2, matches option C.\n\n5.  **Verify the Consistency (Sanity Check):**\n    We can calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for our proposed structure and formula.\n    *   DoU = C - H/2 + 1\n    *   For C11H12O2: DoU = 11 - (12/2) + 1 = 11 - 6 + 1 = 6.\n    *   Our structure contains: 1 benzene ring (4 DoU) + 1 C=C double bond (1 DoU) + 1 C=O double bond (1 DoU) = 6 DoU.\n    *   The DoU is consistent. The other formulas either have a different DoU (C11H14O2 has DoU=5, C12H12O2 has DoU=7) or would require adding a -CH2- group (C12H14O2 has DoU=6, but is C11H12O2 + CH2), which is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data.\n\nTherefore, based on a logical interpretation of all the provided spectroscopic data, the correct chemical formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Spectroscopic Data**\n\n*   **Core Structure:** The problem states the compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This is a benzene ring with two substituents.\n*   **FTIR Data:** An absorption peak for an ester group (-COO-) is present.\n*   **1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** There are *two signals* for the aromatic protons. In a di-substituted benzene ring, this pattern strongly suggests a **1,4- (para) substitution**. A para-substituted ring with two different substituents gives two signals (often two doublets) for the four aromatic protons due to symmetry. This gives us a `p-disubstituted C6H4` core.\n    *   **Vinyl Protons (-CH=CH-):** There are *two signals* for vinyl protons. This indicates a double bond with a hydrogen on each carbon.\n        *   Signal 1: A **doublet**. This means the corresponding proton is adjacent to (coupled with) only one other proton.\n        *   Signal 2: A **doublet of quartets (dq)**. The \"doublet\" part arises from coupling to one proton. The \"quartet\" part arises from coupling to three equivalent protons, which is characteristic of a methyl (-CH3) group.\n        *   This splitting pattern (d + dq) is a classic fingerprint for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)** attached to another group (in this case, the aromatic ring).\n            *   Let's verify: In `Ar-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3`, proton H(a) is split only by H(b), giving a doublet. Proton H(b) is split by H(a) (giving a doublet) and by the adjacent -CH3 group (giving a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. This perfectly matches the data.\n            *   So, one substituent is a propenyl group: `-CH=CH-CH3`.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-CH3):** There are *two signals* for methyl groups.\n        *   Signal 1: We have already identified one methyl group as part of the propenyl substituent (`-CH=CH-CH3`).\n        *   Signal 2: The second methyl group must be part of the other substituent, which we know is an ester. The simplest ester group containing a methyl group is a **methyl ester (-COOCH3)**. The protons of this methyl group would appear as a singlet, as they have no adjacent protons to couple with.\n    *   **Methylene Protons (-CH2-):** The spectrum shows **no signals** for -CH2- groups. This is a crucial piece of information. Our proposed substituents, propenyl (-CH=CH-CH3) and methyl ester (-COOCH3), do not contain any -CH2- groups, which is consistent with the data.\n\n**2. Assemble the Structure and Determine the Formula**\n\nBased on the analysis, we can assemble the molecule:\n*   **Core:** A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring (`C6H4`).\n*   **Substituent 1:** A propenyl group (`-C3H5`).\n*   **Substituent 2:** A methyl ester group (`-COOCH3`).\n\nThe most likely structure is **methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate**.\n\nNow, let's count the atoms to find the chemical formula:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 (in the benzene ring) + 3 (in the propenyl group) + 1 (in the carbonyl C=O) + 1 (in the methoxy -OCH3) = **11 carbons**.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (on the benzene ring) + 5 (in the propenyl group, -CH=CH-CH3) + 3 (in the methoxy -OCH3) = **12 hydrogens**.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (in the ester group, -COO-) = **2 oxygens**.\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**3. Compare with the Options**\n\nThe calculated formula C11H12O2 matches option A. Let's briefly consider why the other options are incorrect:\n*   **C11H14O2:** Has two more hydrogens. This would imply the absence of the C=C double bond in the propenyl group (i.e., it would be a propyl group, -CH2CH2CH3). This would eliminate the vinyl-H signals and introduce -CH2- signals, both of which contradict the data.\n*   **C12H14O2:** Has one more carbon and two more hydrogens. This could correspond to a structure like ethyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate. However, the ethyl group (-CH2CH3) contains a -CH2- group, which is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data.\n*   **C12H12O2:** Has one more carbon but the same number of hydrogens. This would require an additional degree of unsaturation (e.g., another double bond or ring), which is difficult to reconcile with the provided NMR data without violating the \"no -CH2-\" rule or the specific splitting patterns.\n\nThe evidence strongly and consistently points to the formula C11H12O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Spectroscopic Data to Identify Structural Fragments**\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring (C6H6 base) with two substituents, replacing two hydrogen atoms. The core formula for this part is C6H4. The presence of **two signals for aromatic-H** strongly suggests a 1,4- (para) substitution pattern. In a para-disubstituted ring with two different substituents, the chemical environments of the four protons result in two distinct signals (an AA'BB' system).\n\n*   **Ester group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an ester functional group, which has the formula -COO-. This adds one carbon and two oxygen atoms to our count.\n\n*   **Vinyl-H signals:** The spectrum shows two signals for vinyl protons (-CH=CH-).\n    *   One signal is a **doublet**, meaning this proton is coupled to only one adjacent proton.\n    *   The other signal is a **doublet of quartets**. This is a key piece of information. \"Doublet\" means it's coupled to one adjacent proton (the other vinyl proton). \"Quartet\" means it's also coupled to a group of three equivalent protons, which must be a methyl (-CH3) group.\n    *   This splitting pattern uniquely identifies a **propenyl group**: -CH=CH-CH3. The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group gives the doublet of quartets, and the other vinyl proton gives the doublet. This fragment contributes C3H5 to the formula.\n\n*   **-CH3 signals:** The spectrum shows **two signals for -CH3 groups**.\n    *   One of these methyl groups is part of the propenyl (-CH=CH-CH3) group we just identified.\n    *   The second -CH3 signal must come from the other part of the molecule. Given we have an ester group (-COO-), this second methyl group is most likely part of a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH3). This fragment contributes C1H3.\n\n*   **No -CH2 signals:** This is a crucial constraint that eliminates any structures containing methylene (-CH2-) groups.\n\n**2. Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Molecular Formula**\n\nLet's sum the atoms from the fragments we've identified:\n*   From the aromatic ring: C6H4\n*   From the ester group's carbonyl: C1O2\n*   From the propenyl group: C3H5\n*   From the second methyl group: C1H3\n\nNow, let's combine these pieces:\n*   **Total Carbons (C):** 6 (ring) + 1 (carbonyl) + 3 (propenyl) + 1 (methyl) = **11**\n*   **Total Hydrogens (H):** 4 (ring) + 5 (propenyl) + 3 (methyl) = **12**\n*   **Total Oxygens (O):** 2 (ester) = **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\nA possible structure that fits all the data is methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate. This molecule is para-substituted, has an ester, a propenyl group, a second methyl group, and no CH2 groups, perfectly matching all the spectroscopic evidence.\n\n**3. Verify with Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\nThe formula for DoU is: `DoU = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1`.\nLet's calculate the DoU for the deduced formula C11H12O2 and compare it to the structural requirements.\n*   DoU = 11 - (12/2) + 1 = 11 - 6 + 1 = **6**\n\nLet's check if our proposed structure has a DoU of 6:\n*   Benzene ring: 1 ring + 3 double bonds = 4 degrees of unsaturation.\n*   Ester C=O double bond: 1 degree of unsaturation.\n*   Vinyl C=C double bond: 1 degree of unsaturation.\n*   Total DoU = 4 + 1 + 1 = **6**.\nThe calculated DoU matches the structure, confirming our assignment.\n\n**4. Eliminate Other Options**\n\n*   **A) C12H12O2:** DoU = 12 - 12/2 + 1 = 7. This DoU is too high for the identified fragments.\n*   **C) C11H14O2:** DoU = 11 - 14/2 + 1 = 5. This DoU would mean there is no vinyl C=C double bond, which contradicts the NMR data.\n*   **D) C12H14O2:** DoU = 12 - 14/2 + 1 = 6. While the DoU is correct, getting from C11H12O2 to C12H14O2 requires adding a CH2 group. The NMR data explicitly states there are no -CH2- groups, so this option is incorrect.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the spectroscopic data, the only possible chemical formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Spectroscopic Data to Deduce Structural Fragments**\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** The presence of absorption peaks for an ester group indicates the molecule contains a `-COO-` functional group. An ester group contains one carbon and two oxygen atoms.\n\n*   **Compound Type:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This implies a benzene ring (`C6H6`) where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by two substituent groups. The core of the molecule is therefore a `C6H4` fragment.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** A di-substituted benzene ring can be ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4) substituted. A para-substituted ring is symmetrical, which would result in two distinct signals for the four aromatic protons (two sets of two equivalent protons, appearing as two doublets). This is the simplest pattern that fits the \"two signals\" description. We can assume a `p-C6H4` fragment. This fragment accounts for 6 carbons and 4 hydrogens.\n    *   **Vinyl-H (2 signals: one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This splitting pattern is highly characteristic of a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`).\n        *   Let's label the protons: `R-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3`.\n        *   Proton H(b) is adjacent to one vinyl proton H(a) (giving a doublet) and three methyl protons (giving a quartet). The combined splitting results in a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n        *   Proton H(a) is adjacent only to vinyl proton H(b). This results in a **doublet (d)**.\n        *   This confirms the presence of a `-CH=CH-CH3` fragment, which contains 3 carbons and 5 hydrogens.\n    *   **–CH₃ Groups (2 signals):**\n        *   One signal corresponds to the methyl group in the propenyl fragment (`-CH=CH-CH3`).\n        *   The second signal corresponds to another methyl group.\n    *   **No –CH₂ Groups:** The spectrum shows a complete absence of signals for methylene (`-CH2-`) groups. This is a crucial piece of information that eliminates many possible structures (e.g., those with ethyl, propyl, or allyl groups). The second methyl group must be attached to an atom with no hydrogens, such as the aromatic ring, a carbonyl carbon (`-CO-CH3`), or an ester oxygen (`-O-CH3`).\n\n**2. Assemble the Fragments into a Plausible Structure**\n\nWe have the following pieces:\n*   A para-substituted benzene ring: `p-C6H4`\n*   A propenyl group: `-CH=CH-CH3`\n*   An ester group: `-COO-`\n*   A second methyl group: `-CH3`\n\nLet's combine them. The two substituents on the benzene ring must be the propenyl group and a group containing the ester and the second methyl group. There are two primary ways to arrange this:\n\n*   **Structure 1 (Methyl ester):** The substituents are `-CH=CH-CH3` and `-COOCH3`. The full structure is methyl p-(propenyl)benzoate.\n*   **Structure 2 (Phenyl ester):** The substituents are `-CH=CH-CH3` and `-O-CO-CH3`. The full structure is p-(propenyl)phenyl acetate.\n\n**3. Determine the Chemical Formula**\n\nLet's count the atoms for either of these valid structures (they will have the same formula):\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from C₆H₄) + 3 (from -CH=CH-CH₃) + 1 (from -COO-) + 1 (from the second -CH₃) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from C₆H₄) + 5 (from -CH=CH-CH₃) + 3 (from the second -CH₃) = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from -COO-) = **2**\n\nThe chemical formula derived from the spectroscopic data is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n**4. Compare with Options and Use Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\nThe derived formula, C₁₁H₁₂O₂, matches option A. Let's use the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to verify our choice and eliminate other options.\n\nThe DoU for a formula `CxHyOz` is `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n*   Our proposed structure has a benzene ring (DoU=4), a C=C double bond (DoU=1), and a C=O double bond (DoU=1). Total DoU = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for the given options:\n*   A) **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**. (Matches)\n*   B) **C₁₂H₁₄O₂**: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 13 - 7 = **6**. (Matches)\n*   C) **C₁₁H₁₄O₂**: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 12 - 7 = 5. (Incorrect DoU, eliminated)\n*   D) **C₁₂H₁₂O₂**: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 13 - 6 = 7. (Incorrect DoU, eliminated)\n\nWe are left with options A (C₁₁H₁₂O₂) and B (C₁₂H₁₄O₂). The difference between these two formulas is one carbon and two hydrogens (`CH₂`). However, the problem explicitly states there are **no signals for –CH₂ groups**. Therefore, the correct formula cannot be C₁₂H₁₄O₂, as it would require adding a CH₂ unit to the structure we logically deduced (C₁₁H₁₂O₂).\n\nThe only formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Spectroscopic Data**\n\n*   **Compound Type:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we have a benzene ring with two substituents, and four hydrogens on the ring itself. The core of the molecule is C6H4.\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** Shows an absorption peak for an ester group (-COO-). This means the molecule contains two oxygen atoms, a carbonyl group (C=O), and an ether-like linkage.\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Six signals:** This indicates there are six chemically non-equivalent sets of protons in the molecule.\n    *   **Two aromatic-H signals:** For a di-substituted benzene ring, having two signals for the four aromatic protons is characteristic of a para (1,4) substitution pattern, especially with electronically different substituents.\n    *   **Two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This is a very informative splitting pattern. A vinyl group has protons on a C=C double bond.\n        *   A proton that is a **doublet of quartets** is split by two different neighbors: one proton (giving the doublet) and a set of three equivalent protons (giving the quartet). The set of three protons is a methyl (-CH3) group.\n        *   A proton that is a **doublet** is split by one neighboring proton.\n        *   This pattern perfectly describes a propenyl group: **-CH=CH-CH3**. Let's call the protons Ar-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3. H(b) is split by H(a) and the -CH3 group, making it a doublet of quartets. H(a) is split only by H(b), making it a doublet. This fragment has the formula **C3H5**.\n    *   **Two -CH3 group signals:** The molecule has two methyl groups that are in different chemical environments. We have already identified one in the propenyl group (-CH=CH-**CH3**). The second one must be part of the ester group.\n    *   **No -CH2- group signals:** This is a crucial constraint. The structure cannot contain any methylene (-CH2-) groups.\n\n**2. Assemble the Molecular Fragments**\n\nBased on the analysis, we can identify the following pieces of the molecule:\n\n*   **Fragment 1:** A di-substituted benzene ring (**C6H4**).\n*   **Fragment 2:** A propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3), which has the formula **C3H5**. This fragment accounts for the two vinyl-H signals and one of the -CH3 signals. It contains no -CH2- groups.\n*   **Fragment 3:** An ester group that contains the second -CH3 group and has no -CH2- groups. The two simplest possibilities are:\n    *   A methyl ester group: -COOCH3.\n    *   An acetoxy group: -O-CO-CH3.\n    Both of these fragments have the same atomic composition: **C2H3O2**.\n\n**3. Determine the Molecular Formula**\n\nNow, we sum the atoms from all the fragments to find the total molecular formula:\n\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5) + 2 (from C2H3O2) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from C3H5) + 3 (from C2H3O2) = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from C2H3O2) = **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**4. Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)**\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) tells us the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n\n*   **From the structure:**\n    *   Benzene ring = 4 (1 for the ring + 3 for the double bonds)\n    *   Ester C=O group = 1\n    *   Vinyl C=C group = 1\n    *   **Total DBE = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6**\n\n*   **From the derived formula (C11H12O2):**\n    *   DBE = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1\n    *   DBE = 11 - 12/2 + 0/2 + 1 = 11 - 6 + 1 = **6**\n\nThe DBE calculated from the structure matches the DBE calculated from the formula C11H12O2, confirming our result.\n\n**5. Evaluate Other Options**\n\n*   **A) C11H14O2:** DBE = 11 - 14/2 + 1 = 5. This does not match the required DBE of 6.\n*   **C) C12H12O2:** DBE = 12 - 12/2 + 1 = 7. This does not match the required DBE of 6.\n*   **D) C12H14O2:** DBE = 12 - 14/2 + 1 = 6. This DBE matches, but to get this formula from our structure (C11H12O2), we would need to add a 'CH2' unit. The problem explicitly states there are no -CH2- groups, ruling out this option.\n\nConclusion: The only formula that is fully consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the structural information from the problem description:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring with two groups attached, having a base formula of C6H4.\n    *   **FTIR shows an ester group:** This confirms the presence of a -COO- functional group, which contains two oxygen atoms. All the given options (C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2) have two oxygen atoms, consistent with this information.\n    *   **1H NMR data:** This is the most crucial part for determining the structure.\n        *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring with two aromatic proton signals strongly suggests a para (1,4) substitution pattern due to the molecule's symmetry. Ortho and meta substitution would typically result in more complex patterns with more than two signals.\n        *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a key constraint. It means there are no methylene groups in the molecule.\n        *   **Two signals for -CH3 groups:** There are two distinct methyl groups in different chemical environments.\n        *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets):** This splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`).\n            *   Let's denote the group as `Ar-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3`.\n            *   The proton H(b) is coupled to one adjacent proton H(a) (giving a doublet) and three protons of the methyl group (giving a quartet). Thus, its signal would be a **doublet of quartets**. This matches the description.\n            *   The proton H(a) is coupled only to the adjacent proton H(b). Thus, its signal would be a **doublet**. This also matches the description.\n            *   One of the two required -CH3 signals comes from this propenyl group.\n\n2.  **Assemble the molecular fragments:**\n    *   We have a para-substituted benzene ring (`-C6H4-`).\n    *   We have a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`). This is one of the substituents. It also accounts for one of the two methyl signals.\n    *   We have an ester group (`-COO-`).\n    *   We need one more methyl group (`-CH3`) to account for the second methyl signal. This methyl group must be part of the ester to satisfy the valence of all atoms.\n\n3.  **Construct the possible structures and determine the formula:**\n    There are two ways to incorporate the ester group, the propenyl group, and the second methyl group onto the para-substituted benzene ring:\n\n    *   **Case A: The benzene ring is part of the acid component of the ester.**\n        The structure is: `CH3-CH=CH` - `C6H4` - `COOCH3`. (Methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate)\n        Let's sum the atoms:\n        *   Carbon (C): 3 (from propenyl) + 6 (from benzene ring) + 1 (from carboxyl) + 1 (from methyl ester) = 11 carbons.\n        *   Hydrogen (H): 5 (from propenyl) + 4 (from benzene ring) + 3 (from methyl ester) = 12 hydrogens.\n        *   Oxygen (O): 2 (from ester).\n        *   The resulting formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n    *   **Case B: The benzene ring is part of the alcohol component of the ester.**\n        The structure is: `CH3` - `COO` - `C6H4` - `CH=CH-CH3`. (4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)phenyl acetate)\n        Let's sum the atoms:\n        *   Carbon (C): 1 (from acetyl) + 1 (from carboxyl) + 6 (from benzene ring) + 3 (from propenyl) = 11 carbons.\n        *   Hydrogen (H): 3 (from acetyl) + 4 (from benzene ring) + 5 (from propenyl) = 12 hydrogens.\n        *   Oxygen (O): 2 (from ester).\n        *   The resulting formula is also **C11H12O2**.\n\n    Both structures that perfectly match all the spectroscopic data have the same chemical formula: C11H12O2.\n\n4.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    The DBE formula is `C + 1 - H/2`.\n    *   For the deduced formula **C11H12O2**: DBE = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    *   Let's check the DBE from the structure: 1 (for the benzene ring) + 3 (for the double bonds in the ring) + 1 (for the vinyl C=C) + 1 (for the ester C=O) = 6. The DBE matches.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the other options:**\n    *   **A) C11H14O2:** DBE = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 5. This DBE is too low to accommodate a benzene ring (DBE=4), an ester C=O (DBE=1), and a vinyl C=C (DBE=1).\n    *   **B) C12H12O2:** DBE = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7. This implies an extra degree of unsaturation compared to our structure (DBE=6), which is not suggested by the simple NMR data.\n    *   **D) C12H14O2:** DBE = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 6. This DBE is consistent with the structural features. However, to get this formula from our core fragments (`p-C6H4`, `ester`, `propenyl`), we would need to add a CH2 unit (C11H12O2 + CH2 = C12H14O2). But the NMR data explicitly states there are **no -CH2- groups**. Therefore, this formula is incorrect.\n\nBased on the thorough analysis of the provided spectroscopic data, the only possible chemical formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the structural information from the problem description.**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This implies a benzene ring with two substituents, which has the formula C6H4. The four protons on the ring account for the aromatic signals.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum ... shows ... an ester group\"**: This means the molecule contains a -COO- functional group. This group has two oxygen atoms.\n    *   **\"1H NMR spectrum shows six signals\"**: This tells us there are six chemically non-equivalent sets of protons in the molecule.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the 1H NMR data to identify molecular fragments.**\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\"**: This is consistent with the C6H4 group. For example, a 1,4- (para) di-substituted ring would typically show two signals for its four aromatic protons (an AA'BB' system, often appearing as two doublets). This accounts for **4 hydrogens**.\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\"**: Vinyl protons are hydrogens attached to a C=C double bond. This specific splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group, **-CH=CH-CH3**.\n        *   Let's denote it as -CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3.\n        *   H(a) is split only by H(b), so it appears as a **doublet**.\n        *   H(b) is split by H(a) (a doublet) and by the three protons of the -CH3 group (a quartet), resulting in a **doublet of quartets**.\n        *   This fragment accounts for two vinyl hydrogens and one methyl group.\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups\"**: We have already identified one -CH3 group as part of the propenyl fragment. The second -CH3 group must be part of the ester functionality. The two possibilities for an ester group containing a methyl group are a methyl ester (**-COOCH3**) or an acetate ester (**-O-CO-CH3**). Both possibilities add one methyl group to the structure.\n    *   **\"no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups\"**: This is a crucial constraint that helps eliminate other possible structures. For example, we can rule out ethyl esters (-COOCH2CH3), propyl groups (-CH2CH2CH3), or allyl groups (-CH2-CH=CH2).\n\n3.  **Assemble the fragments to build the complete molecule and determine its formula.**\n    *   We have the following pieces:\n        *   A C6H4 aromatic ring.\n        *   A -CH=CH-CH3 (propenyl) group.\n        *   An ester group containing a methyl group (either -COOCH3 or -O-CO-CH3).\n\n    *   Let's assemble these pieces. The two substituents on the C6H4 ring are the propenyl group and the ester-containing group.\n        *   **Possibility 1**: The substituents are -CH=CH-CH3 and -COOCH3.\n        *   **Possibility 2**: The substituents are -CH=CH-CH3 and -O-CO-CH3.\n\n    *   Now, let's calculate the molecular formula for these structures.\n        *   **Carbons (C)**: 6 (from the ring) + 3 (from the propenyl group) + 2 (from either -COOCH3 or -O-CO-CH3) = **11 carbons**.\n        *   **Hydrogens (H)**: 4 (from the ring) + 2 (vinyl H's from propenyl) + 3 (methyl H's from propenyl) + 3 (methyl H's from the ester) = 4 + 2 + 3 + 3 = **12 hydrogens**.\n        *   **Oxygens (O)**: 2 (from the ester group) = **2 oxygens**.\n\n    *   The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Verify the result with the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU).**\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    *   The proposed structure contains a benzene ring (DoU = 4), a C=C double bond (DoU = 1), and a C=O double bond (DoU = 1).\n    *   Total DoU = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n    *   The calculated DoU matches the structure, confirming its validity.\n\n5.  **Compare the derived formula with the given options.**\n    A) C12H12O2\n    B) C11H14O2\n    C) C11H12O2\n    D) C12H14O2\n\n    Our derived formula, C11H12O2, matches option C. The other options are inconsistent with the spectroscopic data. For instance, C11H14O2 would likely lack the vinyl C=C bond, and formulas with 12 carbons or 14 hydrogens would either violate the \"no -CH2-\" rule or contradict the NMR splitting patterns described.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct chemical formula:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Spectroscopic Data to Identify Fragments\n\nFirst, let's break down the information provided by the FTIR and 1H NMR spectra to identify the key structural components of the molecule.\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates the presence of a benzene ring with two substituents. The core of this fragment is `C6H4`. The four protons on this ring will appear in the aromatic region of the 1H NMR spectrum. The presence of two distinct signals for these protons is common for para- or meta-substituted rings.\n*   **FTIR shows an ester group:** This confirms the presence of a `-COO-` functional group.\n*   **1H NMR Signal Analysis:**\n    *   **Vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This is a very specific splitting pattern. A vinyl proton that is a doublet of quartets is coupled to another vinyl proton (giving the doublet) and a methyl group (giving the quartet). This strongly suggests a propenyl group, `-CH=CH-CH3`.\n        *   The proton adjacent to the `-CH3` group is split by the other vinyl proton and the three methyl protons, resulting in a doublet of quartets.\n        *   The other vinyl proton is split only by the first vinyl proton, resulting in a doublet.\n    *   **Two -CH3 signals:** One of these methyl groups is part of the propenyl (`-CH=CH-CH3`) fragment we just identified. The second `-CH3` signal must come from another methyl group elsewhere in the molecule, likely part of the ester (e.g., a methyl ester, `-COOCH3`) or attached to the aromatic ring.\n    *   **No -CH2 groups:** This is a crucial constraint that eliminates many possibilities.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (also called the index of hydrogen deficiency) tells us the total number of rings and pi bonds in the molecule. Let's calculate the DBE from the identified fragments:\n\n*   Aromatic ring: 1 ring + 3 double bonds = 4 DBE\n*   Ester group (C=O): 1 double bond = 1 DBE\n*   Vinyl group (C=C): 1 double bond = 1 DBE\n*   **Total required DBE = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6**\n\nNow, let's calculate the DBE for each of the proposed chemical formulas using the formula: `DBE = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **A) C11H14O2:** DBE = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 12 - 7 = 5. This is inconsistent with the required DBE of 6.\n*   **B) C12H12O2:** DBE = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 13 - 6 = 7. This is inconsistent with the required DBE of 6.\n*   **C) C12H14O2:** DBE = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 13 - 7 = 6. This is consistent with the required DBE of 6.\n*   **D) C11H12O2:** DBE = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6. This is consistent with the required DBE of 6.\n\nThis analysis eliminates options A and B, leaving C and D as possibilities.\n\n### 3. Assemble the Fragments and Apply Constraints\n\nNow we must decide between `C12H14O2` and `C11H12O2`. Let's assemble the fragments we identified in step 1 and count the atoms.\n\n*   Aromatic ring fragment: `C6H4`\n*   Ester fragment: `CO2`\n*   Propenyl fragment: `C3H5` (from `-CH=CH-CH3`)\n*   Second methyl fragment: `CH3`\n\nSumming the atoms from these fragments gives:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 11\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2\n\nThe formula derived from assembling all the required pieces is **`C11H12O2`**. This matches option D.\n\nLet's check why `C12H14O2` (Option C) is incorrect, even though its DBE is correct.\n*   The formula `C12H14O2` contains one extra carbon and two extra hydrogens (`CH2`) compared to the `C11H12O2` formula we derived.\n*   To incorporate a `CH2` unit into any of the plausible structures for `C11H12O2` (like methyl p-propenylbenzoate, `CH3-CH=CH-C6H4-COOCH3`), one would have to do something like:\n    *   Change a methyl group to an ethyl group (e.g., `-COOCH3` -> `-COOCH2CH3`).\n    *   Insert a methylene bridge (e.g., `-C6H4-` -> `-CH2-C6H4-`).\n*   In all such cases, a `-CH2-` group is introduced into the molecule.\n*   The 1H NMR data explicitly states there are **no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups**.\n*   Therefore, the formula `C12H14O2` is inconsistent with the NMR data.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOnly the formula `C11H12O2` is fully consistent with all the information provided: the presence of a di-substituted aromatic ring, an ester group, a propenyl group, a second methyl group, a total of six NMR signals, and the absence of any `-CH2-` groups.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Spectroscopic Data**\n\n*   **Compound Type:** The problem states we have a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This is a benzene ring with two substituents.\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** An absorption peak for an ester group (-COO-) is present.\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:** This provides the most detailed structural information.\n    *   **Six signals total:** This is the total number of distinct proton environments in the molecule.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons (C₆H₄). For these 4 protons to give only two signals, there must be symmetry. This strongly indicates a **para (1,4) substitution pattern**, where protons opposite each other are equivalent.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H:** Vinyl protons are attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n        *   One signal is a **doublet (d)**. This means it's coupled to only one adjacent proton.\n        *   The other is a **doublet of quartets (dq)**. This means it's coupled to one adjacent proton (giving the doublet splitting) and a group of three equivalent protons (giving the quartet splitting). A group of three equivalent protons is a methyl (-CH₃) group.\n        *   This splitting pattern (d and dq) is characteristic of a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**.\n            *   `Ar-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH₃`\n            *   H(a) is split by H(b) into a doublet.\n            *   H(b) is split by H(a) into a doublet, and by the -CH₃ group into a quartet, resulting in a doublet of quartets. This perfectly matches the data.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH₃ groups:**\n        *   One -CH₃ signal belongs to the propenyl group we just identified.\n        *   The second -CH₃ signal must belong to the ester group.\n    *   **No signals for –CH₂ groups:** This is a crucial constraint. It eliminates possibilities like an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) or other longer alkyl chains.\n\n**2. Piece Together the Molecular Structure**\n\nBased on the analysis, we can assemble the molecule's components:\n\n*   A **para-substituted benzene ring** (C₆H₄).\n*   **Substituent 1:** A **propenyl group** (-CH=CH-CH₃). This accounts for one of the -CH₃ signals and the two vinyl-H signals. Its formula fragment is C₃H₅.\n*   **Substituent 2:** An **ester group** that contains the second -CH₃ signal but no -CH₂ group. There are two main possibilities:\n    1.  A **methyl ester group** attached to the ring: `-COOCH₃`.\n    2.  An **acetoxy group** attached to the ring: `-O-CO-CH₃`.\n\nBoth of these ester fragments contain one methyl group and no methylene group, fitting the data.\n\n**3. Determine the Molecular Formula**\n\nNow, let's calculate the total molecular formula by summing the atoms from the core and the substituents. We can use either of the two possible structures derived in the previous step, as they will be isomers and have the same formula.\n\n*   **Core:** para-substituted benzene ring → `C₆H₄`\n*   **Substituent 1:** propenyl group → `C₃H₅`\n*   **Substituent 2:** ester fragment with one methyl group (e.g., `-COOCH₃` or `-O-CO-CH₃`) → `C₂H₃O₂`\n\n**Total Formula Calculation:**\n\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from ester) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from ester's methyl) = **12**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from ester) = **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n**4. Verify with the Options**\n\nLet's check this result against the given choices:\nA) C₁₁H₁₄O₂\nB) C₁₂H₁₄O₂\nC) C₁₂H₁₂O₂\nD) C₁₁H₁₂O₂\n\nOur calculated formula, C₁₁H₁₂O₂, matches option D.\n\n**Verification using Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n\nThe DBE for a formula CₐHₙOₙ is calculated as `DBE = a - b/2 + 1`.\n*   For our deduced structure: 1 aromatic ring (4 DBE) + 1 C=C double bond (1 DBE) + 1 C=O double bond (1 DBE) = **6 DBE**.\n*   For the formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂: `DBE = 11 - 12/2 + 1 = 11 - 6 + 1 = 6`.\nThe DBE matches, confirming our structural analysis and the resulting formula are consistent. The other options either have the wrong DBE (A and C) or cannot be reconciled with the NMR data without violating the given constraints (B).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound from the given spectroscopic data.\n\n**1.

This tells us the core structure is a benzene ring with two substituents, which can be represented as a C6H4 group.\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** Shows an ester group (-COO-). This accounts for the two oxygen atoms in all the proposed formulas. An ester group also contains a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum Breakdown:**\n    *   **No –CH2 groups:** This is a crucial constraint. It rules out groups like ethyl (-CH2CH3), propyl (-CH2CH2CH3), etc.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons (C6**H4**). Two signals for these 4 protons typically indicate a para-substitution pattern with two different substituents, resulting in two doublets (an AA'BB' system). This fragment accounts for **C6** and **H4**.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This is a classic pattern for a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`).\n        *   Let's label the protons: `(A)H-C=C(B)-CH3`.\n        *   Proton (A) is adjacent to only proton (B), so its signal would be a **doublet (d)**.\n        *   Proton (B) is adjacent to proton (A) (1H) and the methyl group (3H). According to the n+1 rule, it will be split into a doublet by proton (A) and a quartet by the -CH3 group. This results in a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n        *   This fragment is `-CH=CH-CH3` and accounts for **C3** and **H5** (1 vinyl-H + 1 vinyl-H + 3 methyl-H).\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:**\n        *   One of these signals corresponds to the methyl group in the propenyl fragment (`-CH=CH-CH3`). This would be a doublet due to coupling with the adjacent vinyl proton.\n        *   The second -CH3 signal must come from the other part of the molecule. Since there are no -CH2- groups, this methyl group is likely part of the ester, forming a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate group (`-O-CO-CH3`). In either case, this fragment adds a **-CH3** group, accounting for **H3**.\n\n**2. Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Formula**\n\nLet's sum up the atoms from the fragments we have deduced:\n\n*   **From the aromatic ring:** C6H4\n*   **From the vinyl and first methyl groups:** A propenyl group, `-CH=CH-CH3`. This has C3H5.\n*   **From the ester and the second methyl group:** We need an ester (`-COO-`) and a methyl group (`-CH3`). The most logical combinations that don't introduce a CH2 group are a methyl carboxylate (`-COOCH3`) or an acetoxy group (`-O-CO-CH3`).\n    *   If the substituent is `-COOCH3`, it contributes C2H3O2.\n    *   If the substituent is `-O-CO-CH3`, it contributes C2H3O2.\n\nLet's build a complete molecule. The two substituents on the C6H4 ring must be the propenyl group and the ester-containing group.\n\n*   **Structure 1:** `(propenyl group)`-C6H4-`(methyl carboxylate group)` -> `CH3-CH=CH-C6H4-COOCH3`\n*   **Structure 2:** `(propenyl group)`-C6H4-`(acetoxy group)` -> `CH3-CH=CH-C6H4-O-CO-CH3`\n\nNow, let's calculate the total molecular formula for either of these possible structures:\n\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5 propenyl) + 2 (from C2H3O2 ester/acetate part) = **11 carbons**.\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from C3H5 propenyl) + 3 (from C2H3O2 ester/acetate part) = **12 hydrogens**.\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group) = **2 oxygens**.\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**3. Compare with the Options**\n\nThe calculated formula is C11H12O2. Let's compare this with the given choices:\nA) C12H14O2\nB) C12H12O2\nC) C11H12O2\nD) C11H14O2\n\nOur derived formula matches option C.\n\nTo be certain, we can quickly re-check the hydrogen and carbon counts from the NMR data alone:\n*   **Total Hydrogens:** 4 (aromatic) + 2 (vinyl) + 3 (methyl 1) + 3 (methyl 2) = 12 H. This eliminates options A (14 H) and D (14 H).\n*   **Total Carbons:** 6 (aromatic ring) + 2 (vinyl C=C) + 1 (methyl C) + 1 (second methyl C) + 1 (ester C=O) = 11 C. This eliminates option B (12 C).\n\nBoth methods of analysis consistently lead to the same formula.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Provided Spectroscopic Data**\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** Indicates the presence of an ester group (-COO-). An ester group contains one carbonyl (C=O) and one C-O bond. It has a molecular formula fragment of -CO2-.\n*   **General Structure:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we have a benzene ring with two other groups attached to it. The core of this ring is C6H4.\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **Six signals total:** This indicates six chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4) has 4 aromatic protons. The fact that they appear as two signals suggests a substitution pattern like ortho (1,2-disubstituted) or para (1,4-disubstituted). In either case, we have a C6H4 group.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This is a classic and very informative splitting pattern. It strongly suggests the presence of a propenyl group, specifically `-CH=CH-CH3`.\n        *   Let's label the protons: -CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3.\n        *   Proton H(b) is split by the adjacent H(a) (giving a doublet) and the three protons of the -CH3 group (giving a quartet). The combination results in a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n        *   Proton H(a) is split only by the adjacent H(b), resulting in a **doublet (d)**.\n        *   This confirms the presence of a `-CH=CH-CH3` fragment, which has a formula of C3H5.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:** One of these methyl signals belongs to the `-CH=CH-CH3` group we just identified. Therefore, there must be a second, distinct `-CH3` group elsewhere in the molecule.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a crucial piece of negative evidence. The final structure cannot contain any methylene (-CH2-) groups.\n\n**2. Assemble the Molecular Fragments**\n\nBased on the analysis above, we have the following pieces of the molecule:\n*   A di-substituted benzene ring: `C6H4`\n*   An ester group: `-COO-`\n*   A propenyl group: `-CH=CH-CH3`\n*   A methyl group: `-CH3`\n\nNow, we must assemble these fragments into a valid chemical structure that is consistent with all the data. The ester group must link two parts of the molecule. There are two primary ways the benzene ring can be part of an ester:\n\n*   **Case A: Methyl Benzoate derivative:** The ring is attached to the carbonyl part of the ester (`C6H4-COO-R`). The two substituents on the ring would be the propenyl group and the ester group itself. R would be the remaining fragment, which is a methyl group (`-CH3`). However, the NMR specifies *two* -CH3 signals, one from the propenyl group and one other. This would only provide one -CH3 signal from the propenyl group and one from the ester's methyl group, which seems to fit. Let's reconsider. The question says there are two signals corresponding to `-CH3` groups. Our fragments are C6H4, COO, -CH=CH-CH3, and -CH3. It seems more likely the two substituents on the ring are -CH3 and something else.\n\nLet's try a different assembly. The two substituents on the C6H4 ring are a methyl group (`-CH3`) and the ester group.\n\n*   **Structure Possibility 1: Propenyl methylbenzoate**\n    *   Let's place the `-CH3` group and the ester group onto the benzene ring. This gives a `CH3-C6H4-COO-` fragment.\n    *   The remaining fragment is the propenyl group, `-CH=CH-CH3`. This group must be attached to the oxygen of the ester.\n    *   The resulting structure is: `CH3-C6H4-COO-CH=CH-CH3`.\n    *   This structure fits all the NMR data: two aromatic signals (possible for ortho/para), vinyl signals for `-O-CH=CH-CH3`, two distinct -CH3 signals (one on the ring, one on the vinyl group), and no -CH2 groups.\n\n*   **Structure Possibility 2: Methyl propenylbenzoate**\n    *   Let's place the `-CH=CH-CH3` group and the ester group onto the ring. This gives a `(CH3-CH=CH)-C6H4-COO-` fragment.\n    *   The remaining fragment is the methyl group, `-CH3`. This must be attached to the ester oxygen.\n    *   The resulting structure is: `(CH3-CH=CH)-C6H4-COOCH3`.\n    *   This structure also fits all the NMR data: two aromatic signals, vinyl signals for `Ar-CH=CH-CH3`, two distinct -CH3 signals (one on the vinyl group, one from the methyl ester), and no -CH2 groups.\n\n**3. Calculate the Chemical Formula**\n\nBoth plausible structures are isomers and should have the same chemical formula. Let's calculate it for the first structure (`CH3-C6H4-COO-CH=CH-CH3`):\n*   **Carbons (C):** 1 (from methyl on ring) + 6 (from ring) + 1 (from ester C=O) + 3 (from propenyl group) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 3 (from methyl on ring) + 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl group) = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from ester group) = **2**\n\nThe chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\n*   **A) C11H12O2:** This matches our derived formula.\n*   **B) C12H12O2:** This would require adding a carbon atom without changing the hydrogen count, which is not possible with simple organic groups. It would disrupt the structure that fits the NMR data.\n*   **C) C12H14O2:** To get this formula from C11H12O2, one must add a `CH2` group. The problem statement explicitly says there are no signals for `-CH2` groups. This option is incorrect.\n*   **D) C11H14O2:** This formula has two more hydrogens than our derived structure. To add two hydrogens, we would need to remove a double bond. However, the NMR data clearly shows a `C=C` double bond (vinyl protons). This option contradicts the NMR data.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that perfectly aligns with all the provided spectroscopic evidence is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Framework:**\n    *   The compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This means we start with a benzene ring that has two hydrogen atoms replaced by other groups. The core formula for this part is C6H4.\n    *   The aromatic nature implies 4 degrees of unsaturation (1 for the ring, 3 for the double bonds).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Functional Groups from FTIR and NMR:**\n    *   **FTIR:** An \"ester group\" is present. An ester has the structure R-COO-R', which contains a carbonyl group (C=O). This accounts for one more degree of unsaturation.\n    *   **1H NMR - No -CH2 groups:** This is a crucial constraint that eliminates many possibilities. For example, we cannot have ethyl, propyl, or butyl groups in their standard forms.\n\n3.  **Deconstruct the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons. Having only two signals for these 4 protons suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely 1,4-disubstitution (para). This confirms the C6H4 part. Total protons so far: 4.\n    *   **Vinyl-H (2 signals: one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) attached to the aromatic ring. Let's analyze the coupling:\n        *   Structure: `Ar-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3`\n        *   The proton `H(a)` is adjacent to `H(b)`, so its signal is split into a **doublet**.\n        *   The proton `H(b)` is adjacent to `H(a)` (causing a doublet split) and also to the three protons of the methyl group (causing a quartet split). The resulting signal is a **doublet of quartets**.\n        *   This confirms the presence of a propenyl group, -C3H5. This group adds 1 degree of unsaturation (the C=C double bond). Total protons from this group: 1+1+3 = 5.\n    *   **-CH3 groups (2 signals):** The NMR spectrum shows two distinct methyl group signals.\n        *   One methyl signal belongs to the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) we just identified.\n        *   The second methyl signal must come from the ester group. Since there are no -CH2- groups, the ester must be either a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate ester (-O-CO-CH3).\n\n4.  **Assemble the Molecular Fragments and Determine the Formula:**\n    Let's assemble the identified parts to build the whole molecule.\n    *   **Fragment 1:** The di-substituted aromatic ring: **C6H4**.\n    *   **Fragment 2:** The propenyl group: **-C3H5**.\n    *   **Fragment 3:** The ester group part containing the second methyl group.\n        *   If it's a methyl ester group attached to the ring: -COOCH3. The formula for this fragment is **-C2H3O2**.\n        *   If it's an acetate group attached to the ring: -O-CO-CH3. The formula for this fragment is also **-C2H3O2**.\n    *   Both possibilities for the ester group fragment have the same formula.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Chemical Formula:**\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from ester part) = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from ester part) = **12**\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from ester part) = **2**\n\n    The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n6.  **Verify the Formula:**\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    *   Let's check if our proposed structure has 6 DoU: 4 (benzene ring) + 1 (propenyl C=C) + 1 (ester C=O) = 6. The DoU matches.\n    *   The formula C11H12O2 corresponds to option C. Other options like C12H14O2 or C11H14O2 would imply the presence of CH2 groups or a different degree of unsaturation, which contradicts the given data. C12H12O2 was shown in the thought process to be inconsistent with the number of vinyl signals.\n\nBased on this detailed analysis of the spectroscopic data, the correct chemical formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct chemical formula.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data:**\n\n    *   **FTIR:** The presence of an ester group is confirmed. An ester functional group contains the structure R-COO-R' and has two oxygen atoms. This means the molecular formula must end in O2. All four options (C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2) satisfy this condition.\n\n    *   **Molecular Structure Core:** The compound is described as a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This implies a benzene ring with two hydrogen atoms replaced by substituents. The core formula of this part of the molecule is C6H4.\n\n    *   **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n        *   **No –CH2 groups:** This is a critical piece of information. It means we can eliminate any proposed structure that contains a methylene (-CH2-) group. This rules out substituents like ethyl (-CH2CH3), propyl (-CH2CH2CH3), or allyl (-CH2CH=CH2).\n        *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:** The compound has two distinct types of methyl groups.\n        *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This pattern is highly characteristic of a propenyl group, specifically `–CH=CH–CH3`.\n            *   The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (creating a quartet). This results in a **doublet of quartets**.\n            *   The other vinyl proton is only split by the first vinyl proton, resulting in a **doublet**.\n            *   This group contributes `C3H5` to the formula and accounts for one of the two –CH3 signals.\n        *   **Putting it together:** Since one –CH3 signal comes from the propenyl group, the second –CH3 signal must belong to the ester. Given the \"no –CH2\" rule, the ester must be a methyl ester (`–COOCH3`), not an ethyl or larger ester. This group contributes `CO2CH3` to the formula.\n        *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4) with two different substituents in a para (1,4) arrangement would give two signals (two doublets), consistent with this description.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Deduced Structure:**\n\n    We have the following components:\n    *   A benzene ring core: `C6H4`\n    *   A propenyl group substituent: `–C3H5`\n    *   A methyl ester substituent: `–COOCH3`\n\n    Combining these parts gives the molecule methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Molecular Formula:**\n\n    Let's sum the atoms from the assembled structure:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5) + 1 (from –CO–) + 1 (from –OCH3) = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from C3H5) + 3 (from –OCH3) = **12**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from the ester group) = **2**\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n\n    The DBE (or index of hydrogen deficiency) can be used as a check.\n    *   **From spectral data:** Aromatic ring (1 ring + 3 double bonds) = 4 DBE. Ester C=O group = 1 DBE. Vinyl C=C group = 1 DBE. Total required DBE = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n    *   **From the derived formula (C11H12O2):** DBE = C + 1 - H/2 = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    The DBE calculation is consistent.\n\n5.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n\n    *   A) C12H14O2 (DBE = 12 + 1 - 14/2 = 6)\n    *   B) C11H12O2 (DBE = 11 + 1 - 12/2 = 6)\n    *   C) C12H12O2 (DBE = 12 + 1 - 12/2 = 7)\n    *   D) C11H14O2 (DBE = 11 + 1 - 14/2 = 5)\n\n    *   Option D is incorrect because its DBE of 5 is too low to accommodate an aromatic ring, an ester, and a vinyl group.\n    *   Option C is incorrect because its DBE of 7 implies an extra ring or double bond for which there is no evidence in the NMR data.\n    *   This leaves options A and B. To get from B (C11H12O2) to A (C12H14O2), one must add a `CH2` unit. As established from the NMR data, the molecule contains no `–CH2–` groups. Therefore, option A is impossible.\n\n    The only formula that perfectly matches all the spectroscopic evidence is **C11H12O2**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nThis problem requires identifying the correct chemical formula for a di-substituted aromatic compound based on its FTIR and 1H NMR spectral data. Let's break down the information provided step-by-step to deduce the structure and its formula.\n\n1.  **Analyze the given spectral data:**\n    *   **Core Structure:** A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This is a benzene ring with two substituents, which means the core has the formula -C6H4-. A benzene ring contributes 4 units to the degree of unsaturation (DoU) (one for the ring itself and three for the double bonds).\n    *   **FTIR Spectrum:** Shows absorption peaks for an ester group. An ester functional group contains a carbonyl (C=O) and a C-O single bond. The carbonyl group contributes 1 unit to the DoU. So far, the required DoU is 4 (ring) + 1 (ester C=O) = 5.\n    *   **1H NMR Spectrum - Six Signals:**\n        *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** In a di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4), there are 4 aromatic protons. Having only two signals implies symmetry. This pattern is characteristic of a para (1,4)-substituted benzene ring, where the two protons ortho to one substituent are equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the other substituent are equivalent, giving rise to two signals (often two doublets).\n        *   **Two signals for vinyl-H:** These are protons attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). This C=C bond adds another unit to the DoU, bringing the total to 6.\n            *   Signal 1: A doublet. This indicates the proton is coupled to only one other proton.\n            *   Signal 2: A doublet of quartets. This indicates the proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons: one proton (giving the doublet) and a set of three equivalent protons (a -CH3 group, giving the quartet).\n            *   This splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)** attached to another group (in this case, the aromatic ring). Let's call the ring `Ar`. In the structure `Ar-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3`, H(a) is split by H(b) into a doublet. H(b) is split by H(a) into a doublet, and this doublet is further split by the -CH3 group into quartets, resulting in a doublet of quartets. This fragment accounts for one C=C double bond, two vinyl protons, and one -CH3 group. The formula of this fragment is **-C3H5**.\n        *   **Two signals for -CH3 groups:** One -CH3 signal comes from the propenyl group described above. The other -CH3 signal must belong to the ester functionality.\n        *   **No signals for -CH2 groups:** This is a critical piece of information that restricts the possible structures.\n\n2.  **Assemble the molecular structure and determine the formula:**\n    *   We have the para-substituted benzene ring core: **C6H4**.\n    *   We have the propenyl substituent: **-C3H5**.\n    *   We have an ester group (-COO-) and the second methyl group (-CH3). The absence of -CH2- signals means the methyl group must be directly attached to the carbonyl (acetate ester, Ar-O-CO-CH3) or the ester oxygen (methyl ester, Ar-COOCH3). Both possibilities lead to the same fragment count. Let's assume a methyl ester substituent: **-COOCH3**. This fragment has the formula **-C2H3O2**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the total molecular formula:**\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5) + 2 (from C2H3O2) = 11\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from C3H5) + 3 (from C2H3O2) = 12\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from C2H3O2)\n    *   The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Verify the result against the given options:**\n    *   The derived formula C11H12O2 matches option A.\n    *   Let's check the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for C11H12O2. DoU = C + 1 - H/2 = 11 + 1 - 12/2 = 12 - 6 = 6. This matches our structural analysis: 4 (benzene ring) + 1 (C=C in propenyl) + 1 (C=O in ester) = 6.\n    *   Now, let's briefly consider the other options:\n        *   B) C11H14O2: DoU = 5. This would mean no C=C double bond in the side chain, which contradicts the vinyl-H signals.\n        *   C) C12H12O2: DoU = 7. This requires an additional double bond or ring, for which there is no evidence.\n        *   D) C12H14O2: DoU = 6. This formula has the same DoU as option A, but differs by a CH2 unit. Since the NMR data explicitly states there are no -CH2- groups, this option is ruled out.\n\nThe only formula that is fully consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Structural Information from the Problem Statement**\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This tells us the core of the molecule is a benzene ring with two substituents, meaning four hydrogen atoms are attached to the ring. This corresponds to a C6H4 fragment.\n*   **FTIR shows an ester group:** The molecule contains a -COO- functional group. This group includes a carbonyl (C=O) bond.\n*   **1H NMR Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   **Six signals total:** This indicates six distinct types of protons in the molecule.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** For a di-substituted benzene ring, having only two signals for the four aromatic protons strongly suggests a para (1,4) substitution pattern. In a para-substituted ring (G1-C6H4-G2 where G1 ≠ G2), the protons ortho to G1 are equivalent, and the protons ortho to G2 are equivalent, leading to two distinct signals (typically two doublets).\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** Vinyl protons are attached to a C=C double bond. This splitting pattern is highly characteristic of a propenyl group fragment, `-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3`.\n        *   Proton H(a) is coupled only to H(b), resulting in a doublet.\n        *   Proton H(b) is coupled to H(a) (giving a doublet) and the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (giving a quartet). The combination results in a doublet of quartets.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:**\n        *   One methyl group is identified as part of the propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`).\n        *   The second methyl signal must belong to the ester group.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a critical piece of information that eliminates many possibilities, such as an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) or an ethyl substituent on the ring.\n\n**2. Assemble the Molecular Fragments**\n\nBased on the analysis above, we can identify the following building blocks of the molecule:\n*   A para-substituted benzene ring: **C6H4**\n*   A propenyl group: **-CH=CH-CH3**\n*   An ester group that contains a methyl group but no methylene group. The two possibilities are a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH3).\n\nLet's assemble these pieces. The two substituents on the C6H4 ring are the propenyl group and the ester-containing group.\n\n*   **Substituent 1:** Propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`). Its contribution to the formula is C3H5.\n*   **Substituent 2:** This must be the ester part containing the second methyl group.\n    *   Case A: The ring is attached to the carbonyl carbon, forming a methyl benzoate derivative. The substituent is `-COOCH3`.\n    *   Case B: The ring is attached to the ester oxygen, forming a phenyl acetate derivative. The substituent is `-O-CO-CH3`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Molecular Formula**\n\nLet's calculate the total formula by summing the atoms from the fragments. Both Case A and Case B lead to the same final formula. Let's use Case A for the calculation:\n\n*   **Carbons (C):**\n    *   From the benzene ring (C6H4): 6\n    *   From the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3): 3\n    *   From the methyl ester group (-COOCH3): 1 (carbonyl C) + 1 (methyl C) = 2\n    *   **Total C = 6 + 3 + 2 = 11**\n\n*   **Hydrogens (H):**\n    *   From the benzene ring (C6H4): 4\n    *   From the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3): 5\n    *   From the methyl ester group (-COOCH3): 3\n    *   **Total H = 4 + 5 + 3 = 12**\n\n*   **Oxygens (O):**\n    *   From the ester group (-COO-): 2\n    *   **Total O = 2**\n\nCombining these, the molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**4. Verify with Degrees of Unsaturation (DBE)**\n\nThe DBE indicates the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n*   **From the derived structure:**\n    *   Benzene ring = 1 ring + 3 double bonds = 4 DBE\n    *   Vinyl C=C bond = 1 DBE\n    *   Ester C=O bond = 1 DBE\n    *   **Total DBE = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6**\n\n*   **From the proposed formula (C11H12O2):**\n    *   DBE = C - (H/2) + 1 = 11 - (12/2) + 1 = 11 - 6 + 1 = 6\n\nThe DBE calculated from the structure (6) matches the DBE calculated from the formula C11H12O2 (6), confirming its plausibility.\n\n**5. Evaluate the Other Options**\n\nLet's quickly check the DBE for the other formulas provided:\n*   **A) C12H14O2:** DBE = 12 - (14/2) + 1 = 6. While the DBE is correct, this formula has an extra C and 2H (a CH2 unit) compared to our derived formula. This contradicts the \"no –CH2 groups\" information from the NMR spectrum.\n*   **C) C11H14O2:** DBE = 11 - (14/2) + 1 = 5. Incorrect DBE.\n*   **D) C12H12O2:** DBE = 12 - (12/2) + 1 = 7. Incorrect DBE.\n\nTherefore, C11H12O2 is the only formula that is fully consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nThe reasoning is as follows:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the given information:**\n    *   **Skeleton:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we start with a benzene ring (C6) with two hydrogen atoms replaced by other groups. The remaining part of the ring is C6H4. The aromatic ring itself accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (DBE).\n    *   **FTIR:** An ester group is present (-COO-). This adds 1 carbon, 2 oxygens, and 1 degree of unsaturation (from the C=O double bond). Total DBE so far is 4 + 1 = 5.\n    *   **1H NMR:**\n        *   **2 aromatic-H signals:** A di-substituted benzene ring with two aromatic signals often implies a 1,4 (*para*) substitution pattern, which creates chemical symmetry.\n        *   **2 vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This splitting pattern is a classic signature for a `-CH=CH-CH3` group (a propenyl group). The vinyl proton adjacent to the methyl group is split into a doublet of quartets, and the other vinyl proton is a doublet. This group contributes C3H5 to the formula and another degree of unsaturation (from the C=C double bond). The total DBE is now 5 + 1 = 6.\n        *   **2 -CH3 signals:** One methyl group is from the propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`). The other must be part of the ester group.\n        *   **No -CH2 signals:** This is a critical piece of information. It eliminates possibilities like an ethyl ester (`-COOCH2CH3`) or other longer alkyl chains.\n\n2.  **Assemble the molecule:**\n    *   We have the `C6H4` core.\n    *   We have a propenyl substituent: `-C3H5`.\n    *   We have an ester substituent containing a methyl group and no methylene (`-CH2-`) groups. The only simple possibility is a methyl ester: `-COOCH3`. This fragment contributes `C2H3O2`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the total chemical formula:**\n    *   **Carbon:** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from methyl ester) = **11 Carbons**\n    *   **Hydrogen:** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from methyl ester) = **12 Hydrogens**\n    *   **Oxygen:** 2 (from methyl ester) = **2 Oxygens**\n    *   The final formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Verify with the provided options and DBE:**\n    *   The derived formula, C11H12O2, corresponds to option B.\n    *   The Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) for C11H12O2 is calculated as `C - H/2 + 1 = 11 - 12/2 + 1 = 11 - 6 + 1 = 6`. This matches our structural analysis (1 ring + 1 C=C + 1 C=O = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 DBE).\n    *   Let's check the other options. For example, C12H14O2 (Option D) also has 6 DBE. However, to form this molecule while keeping the core structure, one would need to add a CH2 group (e.g., making an ethyl ester), which contradicts the NMR data stating there are no -CH2- groups.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the spectral data is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Structural Information:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This implies a benzene ring (C6H6) where two hydrogen atoms are replaced by substituents. The core of the molecule is therefore a C6H4 group, which contains 4 aromatic protons.\n    *   **FTIR - Ester group:** The presence of an ester group (-COO-) is confirmed. This accounts for two oxygen atoms and one carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   **No -CH2 groups:** The 1H NMR spectrum shows no signals for -CH2 groups. This is a critical piece of information that helps eliminate many potential structures.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Six signals total:** This indicates six chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 protons. If these 4 protons give only two signals, it strongly suggests a para (1,4) substitution pattern. In a para-substituted ring with two different substituents (R1-C6H4-R2), the protons at positions 2 and 6 are equivalent, and the protons at positions 3 and 5 are equivalent, leading to two distinct signals (an AA'BB' system).\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H:** This indicates a C=C double bond with two hydrogens. Let's call them Ha and Hb.\n        *   One signal is a **doublet**. This means the corresponding proton (e.g., Ha) is coupled to only one other proton (Hb).\n        *   The other signal is a **doublet of quartets**. This means the other proton (Hb) is coupled to two sets of protons: one proton (the doublet part, from Ha) and a group of three equivalent protons (the quartet part). A group of three equivalent protons is a methyl (-CH3) group.\n        *   This specific splitting pattern perfectly describes a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**.\n    *   **Two signals for -CH3 groups:**\n        *   One -CH3 signal comes from the propenyl group (-CH=CH-**CH3**) we just identified.\n        *   The other -CH3 signal must belong to the ester group. Since there are no -CH2- groups allowed, this ester cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) or anything larger. It must be either a **methyl ester (-COOCH3)** or an **acetate ester (-O-CO-CH3)**.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Molecular Structure and Determine the Formula:**\n\n    Let's assemble the identified fragments:\n    *   Fragment 1: A para-substituted benzene ring (**C6H4**)\n    *   Fragment 2: A propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3, which has a formula of **C3H5**)\n    *   Fragment 3: An ester group containing a methyl group.\n        *   Case A: A methyl ester group (-COOCH3, which has a formula of **C2H3O2**)\n        *   Case B: An acetoxy group (-O-CO-CH3, which has a formula of **C2H3O2**)\n\n    Both possible ester groups have the same atomic composition. Now, let's sum the atoms from all fragments to find the molecular formula:\n\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5) + 2 (from C2H3O2) = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from C3H5) + 3 (from C2H3O2) = **12**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from C2H3O2) = **2**\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Verify with Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n\n    The Degree of Unsaturation tells us the total number of rings and pi bonds.\n    *   From the structure: Benzene ring (4 DoU) + C=C double bond (1 DoU) + C=O double bond (1 DoU) = **6 DoU**.\n    *   Let's check the DoU for the candidate formula C11H12O2 using the formula DoU = C + 1 - H/2:\n        *   DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**.\n    *   The DoU matches, confirming our structural analysis.\n\n5.  **Evaluate Other Options:**\n    *   **A) C12H14O2:** DoU = 12 + 1 - 14/2 = 6. While the DoU is correct, this formula has an extra CH2 compared to our derived formula (C11H12O2). Adding a CH2 group would create a -CH2- signal in the NMR, which is explicitly absent.\n    *   **B) C12H12O2:** DoU = 12 + 1 - 12/2 = 7. This DoU is incorrect.\n    *   **C) C11H14O2:** DoU = 11 + 1 - 14/2 = 5. This DoU is incorrect.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the provided spectroscopic data, the only possible chemical formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Information from the Spectra and Description:**\n\n*   **Structure:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This indicates a benzene ring (C6H6) with two hydrogen atoms replaced by substituents. The core formula for this part is C6H4.\n*   **FTIR:** An ester group is present. This is a functional group with the structure R-COO-R', containing one C=O bond and one C-O bond. It adds two oxygen atoms (O2) to the formula.\n*   **1H NMR - Aromatic Region:** There are two signals for aromatic protons. A disubstituted benzene ring gives two signals for its aromatic protons only when it has a plane of symmetry, which is characteristic of a **1,4- (para) substitution pattern**. Ortho (1,2) and meta (1,3) substitution would each result in four distinct signals for the four aromatic protons.\n*   **1H NMR - Vinyl Region:** There are two signals for vinyl protons (-CH=CH-).\n    *   One signal is a **doublet**. This means the proton is coupled to only one adjacent proton.\n    *   The other signal is a **doublet of quartets**. The \"doublet\" part arises from coupling to the other vinyl proton. The \"quartet\" part (splitting into 4 lines) arises from coupling to three equivalent adjacent protons, which must be a methyl (-CH3) group.\n    *   This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**. Let's label the protons: R-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3. Proton H(a) is split by H(b) into a doublet. Proton H(b) is split by H(a) into a doublet, and by the three protons of the CH3 group into a quartet, resulting in a doublet of quartets. This fragment has the formula **C3H5**.\n*   **1H NMR - Alkyl Region:**\n    *   There are **two signals for -CH3 groups**. We've already identified one from the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3). This methyl group is adjacent to a vinyl proton, so it would appear as a doublet.\n    *   The second -CH3 signal must belong to the ester group. Since there are no -CH2- groups, the ester cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) or anything larger. It must be either a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH3). In either case, the methyl group is isolated and would appear as a singlet.\n    *   The fragment containing the ester and the second methyl group has the formula **C2H3O2**.\n*   **No -CH2- groups:** This is a crucial piece of information that rules out many possibilities like ethyl, propyl, or allyl groups.\n\n**2. Assemble the Fragments to Determine the Molecular Formula:**\n\nNow, let's sum the atoms from the deduced fragments to find the overall molecular formula.\n\n*   **Aromatic ring (para-substituted):** C6H4\n*   **Propenyl side chain:** C3H5\n*   **Ester and methyl part:** C2H3O2\n\nTotal count:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**3. Verification with Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n\nThe DBE is a useful check.\n*   DBE = C + 1 - (H/2)\n*   DBE = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**\n\nLet's check the DBE from the proposed structure:\n*   Benzene ring = 1 ring + 3 π-bonds = 4 DBE\n*   C=C double bond in the propenyl group = 1 DBE\n*   C=O double bond in the ester group = 1 DBE\n*   Total DBE = 4 + 1 + 1 = **6**\nThe calculated DBE matches the DBE derived from the formula, confirming that C11H12O2 is the correct formula for the described structure.\n\n**4. Compare with the Given Options:**\n\n*   A) C12H12O2\n*   B) C11H14O2\n*   C) C11H12O2\n*   D) C12H14O2\n\nOur derived formula, C11H12O2, matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Structural Information:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This tells us we start with a benzene ring (C6H6) that has two hydrogen atoms replaced by other groups. The core of this part is therefore C6H4.\n    *   **FTIR shows an ester group:** An ester functional group has the structure R-COO-R'. This group contains one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms (-COO-). This accounts for the O2 in all the given options.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a critical constraint. The final structure cannot contain any methylene (-CH2-) groups.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons. The fact that they show up as only two signals strongly suggests a *para* (1,4) substitution pattern due to the molecule's symmetry. This doesn't change the atom count (still C6H4), but it helps in visualizing the structure.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** Vinyl protons are hydrogens attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (-CH=CH-).\n        *   The splitting patterns give a crucial clue. A doublet of quartets (dq) means a proton is coupled to one adjacent proton (giving the doublet) and to three other equivalent protons (giving the quartet). This pattern is characteristic of a proton in a `-CH=CH-CH3` group. The proton on the carbon adjacent to the CH3 group will be split into a dq.\n        *   The other vinyl proton would be a doublet, as it's only coupled to its vinyl partner.\n        *   Therefore, the NMR data indicates the presence of a **propenyl group** (`-CH=CH-CH3`). This fragment consists of 3 carbons and 5 hydrogens (C3H5). It also accounts for one of the two methyl groups mentioned.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:**\n        *   We have already identified one CH3 group as part of the propenyl fragment (`-CH=CH-CH3`).\n        *   The presence of a second CH3 signal means there is another methyl group (`-CH3`) elsewhere in the molecule. This fragment is C1H3.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Pieces and Calculate the Formula:**\n    Let's sum the atoms from all the fragments we've identified based on the spectral data:\n    *   **Aromatic ring:** C6H4\n    *   **Ester group (carbonyl part):** C (the COO carbon) and O2\n    *   **Propenyl group:** C3H5 (This accounts for the vinyl protons and one CH3 group)\n    *   **Second methyl group:** C1H3\n\n    Now, let's total the atoms:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from ring) + 1 (from ester) + 3 (from propenyl) + 1 (from the other methyl) = 11\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from the other methyl) = 12\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from ester) = 2\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    The DoU formula is C - H/2 + N/2 + 1. For C11H12O2:\n    DoU = 11 - (12/2) + 1 = 11 - 6 + 1 = 6.\n    Let's check if our proposed structure matches this DoU:\n    *   Benzene ring: 4 degrees of unsaturation (1 ring + 3 double bonds)\n    *   C=C double bond (from the propenyl group): 1 degree of unsaturation\n    *   C=O double bond (from the ester group): 1 degree of unsaturation\n    *   Total DoU = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n    The calculated DoU matches the structural features deduced from the spectra.\n\n5.  **Evaluate Other Options:**\n    *   **C11H14O2:** DoU = 5. This is inconsistent with the presence of a benzene ring, a C=C bond, and a C=O bond.\n    *   **C12H14O2:** DoU = 6. To get this formula from C11H12O2, one must add a CH2 unit. However, the NMR data explicitly states there are no –CH2 groups.\n    *   **C12H12O2:** DoU = 7. This requires an additional degree of unsaturation (e.g., another double bond or ring) compared to our deduced structure, which is not supported by the NMR data.\n\nThe only formula that perfectly matches all the spectroscopic evidence is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nAn example of a compound that fits all the described data is **methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate**. Let's break down its structure and see how it matches the evidence.\n\n*   **Structure:**\n    *   A benzene ring is substituted at the 1 and 4 positions (para).\n    *   One substituent is a methyl ester group (-COOCH3).\n    *   The other substituent is a prop-1-en-1-yl group (-CH=CH-CH3).\n*   **Formula Calculation:**\n    *   Benzene ring core: C6H4\n    *   Methyl ester group: C2H3O2\n    *   Prop-1-en-1-yl group: C3H5\n    *   Total: C(6+2+3) H(4+3+5) O(2) = **C11H12O2**\n*   **Spectroscopic Data Match:**\n    *   **FTIR:** The methyl ester group (-COOCH3) is an ester. This matches.\n    *   **1H NMR:**\n        *   **Aromatic-H:** The para-substitution pattern gives two signals for the 4 aromatic protons (two doublets). This matches (2 signals).\n        *   **Vinyl-H:** The -CH=CH- part gives two signals for the two vinyl protons. This matches (2 signals). The splitting would be a doublet and a doublet of quartets as described.\n        *   **–CH3 Groups:** There is one methyl group in the ester (-COOCH3) and one in the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3). These are in different chemical environments, so they give two distinct signals. This matches (2 signals).\n        *   **No –CH2 Groups:** The structure contains no -CH2- units. This matches.\n\nThe molecular formula C11H12O2 is the only one that is consistent with the detailed structural information derived from the NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning to identify the correct chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Structure:** The problem states the compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" This means we start with a benzene ring (C6H6) and replace two hydrogen atoms with other groups. The core of our molecule is therefore C6H4.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Spectroscopic Data:**\n    *   **FTIR:** Shows an ester group (-COO-). This accounts for the two oxygen atoms in the formula.\n    *   **1H NMR:**\n        *   **Two Aromatic-H Signals:** For a di-substituted benzene ring, having only two signals in the aromatic region strongly suggests a 1,4- (para-) substitution pattern due to the molecule's symmetry.\n        *   **Two Vinyl-H Signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3).\n            *   The proton on the carbon attached to the ring is split only by the other vinyl proton, resulting in a doublet.\n            *   The other vinyl proton is split by the first vinyl proton (making it a doublet) and also by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (making it a quartet). The combined effect is a doublet of quartets.\n            *   This substituent adds a C3H5 group to our formula.\n        *   **Two -CH3 Signals:** One signal is from the propenyl group's methyl (`-CH=CH-CH3`). The second signal must belong to the ester group.\n        *   **No -CH2 Signals:** The absence of a -CH2 signal is crucial. It eliminates possibilities like an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3). Therefore, the ester must be a methyl ester (-COOCH3). This substituent adds a C2H3O2 group.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Full Formula:**\n    *   Start with the aromatic core: C6H4\n    *   Add the propenyl group: + C3H5\n    *   Add the methyl ester group: + C2H3O2\n\n    Now, let's sum the atoms:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 0 + 0 + 2 = 2\n\n    The final molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated formula C11H12O2 matches option C.\n\nThe Python code executed in the previous step also confirmed this calculation, summing the atoms of a para-disubstituted benzene ring (C6H4), a propenyl group (C3H5), and a methyl ester group (COOCH3) to arrive at C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nMy reasoning has identified the following key points:\n1.  **Aromatic Ring + Di-substitution**: This gives a base of `C6H4`.\n2.  **Ester Group**: The FTIR shows a `-COO-` group.\n3.  **1H NMR Analysis**:\n    *   No `-CH2-` groups.\n    *   Two aromatic signals (likely `para`-substitution).\n    *   Vinyl signals (doublet and doublet of quartets) strongly suggest a `-CH=CH-CH3` (propenyl) group.\n    *   Two `-CH3` signals correspond to the `-CH=CH-CH3` and a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`). The methyl ester is necessary to have an ester group without a `-CH2-`.\n4.  **Assembling the Structure**: Combining the parts (`C6H4`, `-CH=CH-CH3`, and `-COOCH3`) leads to the structure of methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate.\n5.  **Calculating the Formula**:\n    *   Carbons: 6 (ring) + 3 (propenyl) + 2 (ester) = 11\n    *   Hydrogens: 4 (ring) + 5 (propenyl) + 3 (ester methyl) = 12\n    *   Oxygens: 2 (ester)\n    *   The resulting formula is `C11H12O2`.\n6.  **Verification with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**:\n    *   The proposed structure has 1 ring (DoU=4), 1 C=C bond (DoU=1), and 1 C=O bond (DoU=1), for a total DoU of 6.\n    *   The code output confirms that `C11H12O2` has a DoU of 6, matching the requirement.\n    *   The code output also confirms that while `C12H14O2` also has a DoU of 6, it differs from the deduced structure by a `CH2` unit, which contradicts the NMR data.\n\nAll evidence points to `C11H12O2`.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Basic Structure:** The problem states the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This corresponds to a benzene ring (C6) with two substituents, meaning four hydrogens are directly attached to the ring. The core of the molecule is therefore C6H4.\n\n2.  **Interpret the FTIR Spectrum:** The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of an ester group (-COO-). An ester group contains one carbonyl group (C=O) and one ether-like oxygen. It contributes two oxygen atoms to the molecular formula.\n\n3.  **Interpret the 1H NMR Spectrum:** This provides the most detailed information about the structure.\n    *   **Aromatic-H signals (2 signals):** A di-substituted benzene ring with two distinct signals for its four protons is characteristic of a 1,4 (para) substitution pattern. This gives two sets of two equivalent protons, each appearing as a doublet. This confirms the C6H4 core.\n    *   **Vinyl-H signals (2 signals):** There are two hydrogens on a carbon-carbon double bond. One signal is a doublet, and the other is a doublet of quartets. This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3).\n        *   The H atom adjacent to the CH3 group is split by the other vinyl H (into a doublet) and by the three protons of the CH3 group (into a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets.\n        *   The other vinyl H is split only by its vinyl neighbor, resulting in a doublet.\n        *   This fragment has the formula C3H5.\n    *   **-CH3 signals (2 signals):** There are two distinct methyl (-CH3) groups.\n        *   One of these belongs to the propenyl group we just identified (-CH=CH-**CH3**).\n        *   The other must be part of the ester group.\n    *   **No –CH2 groups:** This is a critical piece of information. It means there are no methylene groups in the structure. The ester cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3), and the other substituent cannot be an allyl group (-CH2-CH=CH2) or a propyl group (-CH2CH2CH3). This supports our identification of the methyl-containing ester and the propenyl group. The ester group must be either a methyl ester (Ar-COO-CH3) or an acetate group (Ar-O-CO-CH3). Both contain one CH3 group and no CH2 groups.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Formula:** Now we can assemble the molecular fragments we have identified to find the total chemical formula.\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** C6H4\n    *   **Propenyl Group:** -CH=CH-CH3 → C3H5\n    *   **Ester functionality with a methyl group:** This can be either a methyl carboxylate (-COOCH3) or an acetate (-OCOCH3).\n        *   The -COOCH3 fragment contributes C=2, H=3, O=2.\n        *   The -OCOCH3 fragment contributes C=2, H=3, O=2.\n        *   Both possibilities add C2H3O2 to the formula.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Formula:** Sum the atoms from all the fragments:\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from ester) = 11\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from ester's methyl) = 12\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from ester) = 2\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   A) C12H14O2\n    *   B) C12H12O2\n    *   C) C11H12O2\n    *   D) C11H14O2\n\n    The calculated formula C11H12O2 matches option C. The other formulas are inconsistent with the NMR data, particularly the absence of -CH2- signals. For instance, C11H14O2 would imply saturation of the propenyl double bond to a propyl group, which would have CH2 signals. C12H14O2 could correspond to an ethyl ester, which would also have a CH2 signal.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the given spectroscopic data to identify key structural features and fragments of the molecule.**\n\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\":** This indicates the core of the molecule is a benzene ring with two substituents attached, having the base formula C6H4. A benzene ring accounts for a degree of unsaturation of 4 (one ring and three double bonds).\n\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum ... shows absorption peaks indicating the presence of an ester group\":** This confirms the presence of a -COO- functional group. An ester group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), which adds one degree of unsaturation.\n\n    *   **\"1H NMR spectrum shows six signals\":** This tells us there are six chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n        *   **\"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\":** A di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4) has 4 aromatic protons. The fact that they appear as two signals suggests an ortho or meta substitution pattern, where protons are in at least two different chemical environments.\n        *   **\"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\":** This splitting pattern is highly characteristic of a propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH3). The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by both the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and the three methyl protons (creating a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets (dq). The other vinyl proton is split only by the first vinyl proton, resulting in a doublet (d). This fragment has the formula C3H5 and contains one carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), adding another degree of unsaturation.\n        *   **\"two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups\":** One of these methyl signals comes from the propenyl group (–CH=CH–**CH3**). The presence of a second, distinct –CH3 signal indicates another methyl group is present elsewhere in the molecule.\n        *   **\"no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups\":** This is a crucial constraint. It eliminates possibilities such as ethyl (–CH2CH3), propyl (–CH2CH2CH3), or any other group containing a methylene (–CH2–) unit.\n\n2.  **Assemble the identified fragments into a complete structure.**\n\n    We have the following pieces to assemble:\n    *   A C6H4 benzene ring core.\n    *   An ester linkage (–COO–).\n    *   A propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH3).\n    *   A second methyl group (–CH3).\n\n    The compound is di-substituted, meaning two groups are attached to the C6H4 ring. These two substituent groups must be formed from the remaining fragments: the ester, the propenyl group, and the methyl group. There are two primary ways to assemble this:\n\n    *   **Possibility A:** The two substituents are a propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH3) and an acetoxy group (–O–CO–CH3). The structure would be a propenylphenyl acetate isomer (e.g., 4-propenylphenyl acetate). This structure is consistent with all the NMR data.\n\n    *   **Possibility B:** The two substituents are a propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH3) and a methoxycarbonyl group (–CO–O–CH3). The structure would be a methyl propenylbenzoate isomer (e.g., methyl 4-propenylbenzoate). This structure is also consistent with all the NMR data.\n\n3.  **Calculate the molecular formula for the proposed structure(s).**\n\n    Let's calculate the formula for either possibility, as they are composed of the same atoms. We sum the atoms from the constituent parts:\n    *   Benzene ring: C6H4\n    *   Propenyl group: C3H5\n    *   Ester portion (either acetoxy –O–CO–CH3 or methoxycarbonyl –CO–O–CH3): C2H3O2\n    *   **Total Carbon (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n    *   **Total Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n    *   **Total Oxygen (O):** 2\n    *   The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the other given options.**\n\n    *   **C11H14O2:** Degree of unsaturation is 5. Compared to C11H12O2 (degree of unsaturation = 6), this formula implies the loss of one double bond. This would contradict the presence of either the C=C (no vinyl signals) or C=O (no ester) bond. Incorrect.\n    *   **C12H12O2:** Degree of unsaturation is 7. This requires an additional double bond or ring compared to our derived structure. It is not possible to add another carbon and maintain the \"no -CH2-\" rule and the specific NMR splitting patterns described. Incorrect.\n    *   **C12H14O2:** Degree of unsaturation is 6. This formula contains an extra CH2 group compared to our C11H12O2 structure. The presence of a CH2 group is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data. Incorrect.\n\nThe only formula that perfectly matches all the detailed spectroscopic evidence is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the core structure:** The problem states the compound is a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This means we start with a benzene ring that has two substituents, so its formula is C6H4. The `1H NMR` spectrum shows only two signals for aromatic protons, which strongly suggests a 1,4- (or para-) substitution pattern, as this symmetry would make the protons at positions 2 and 6 equivalent, and the protons at positions 3 and 5 equivalent, resulting in two signals.\n\n2.  **Identify the functional groups from the spectra:**\n    *   **FTIR:** Shows an ester group (-COO-). This accounts for the two oxygen atoms in the molecular formula options.\n    *   **¹H NMR:**\n        *   **No –CH2 groups:** This is a critical piece of information that eliminates many possibilities, such as ethyl esters (-COOCH2CH3), ethyl groups (-CH2CH3), or propyl groups (-CH2CH2CH3) as substituents.\n        *   **Two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group, -CH=CH-CH3.\n            *   Let's label the protons: -CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3(c).\n            *   The proton H(a) is split only by H(b), so it appears as a doublet.\n            *   The proton H(b) is split by H(a) (a doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (a quartet), so it appears as a doublet of quartets.\n            *   This confirms the presence of a -CH=CH-CH3 group. This fragment has the formula C3H5.\n        *   **Two –CH3 signals:**\n            *   One of these methyl signals belongs to the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3). Its protons would be split by the adjacent vinyl proton H(b), appearing as a doublet.\n            *   The second methyl signal must be part of the ester group. Since there are no -CH2- groups, it cannot be an ethyl ester. It must be a methyl group attached directly to the ester, either as a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate group (-O-CO-CH3). In either case, this fragment contributes C2H3O2 to the overall formula.\n\n3.  **Assemble the fragments and determine the molecular formula:**\n    *   Aromatic ring: C6H4\n    *   Propenyl group: C3H5\n    *   Ester and methyl group fragment (-COOCH3 or -OCOCH3): C2H3O2\n\n    Now, sum the atoms from these fragments:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from ester/methyl) = 11\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from ester/methyl) = 12\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from ester)\n\n    The calculated molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Compare the result with the given options:**\n    *   A) C11H14O2\n    *   B) C11H12O2\n    *   C) C12H12O2\n    *   D) C12H14O2\n\n    Our calculated formula, C11H12O2, matches option B. Let's briefly check why the other options are incorrect based on the data:\n    *   C11H14O2 and C12H14O2: These formulas have more hydrogen atoms, which implies more saturation. To fit the description, you would likely need to replace the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) with a propyl group (-CH2CH2CH3) or add a CH2 group elsewhere, both of which are ruled out by the \"no -CH2 groups\" constraint.\n    *   C12H12O2: This would require adding one carbon atom without adding hydrogen atoms relative to our derived structure. This is not possible given the fragments identified from the NMR spectrum.\n\nTherefore, the only formula consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the information from the 1H NMR spectrum to determine the number of hydrogen atoms.**\n    The spectrum shows signals for several types of protons (H). By summing up the number of protons represented by each signal type, we can find the total number of hydrogen atoms in the molecule.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** In a di-substituted benzene ring, there are 4 aromatic protons. The fact that they appear as two signals strongly suggests a para (1,4) substitution pattern, where symmetry causes the 4 protons to fall into two equivalent sets of two (2H + 2H). Total aromatic protons = 4H.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H:** Vinyl protons are those attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (-CH=CH-). The description of one signal as a doublet and the other as a doublet of quartets is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3). In this group, there are two vinyl protons. Total vinyl protons = 2H.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:** This indicates the presence of two distinct methyl groups in the molecule. Each methyl group has 3 protons. Total methyl protons = 2 * 3H = 6H.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This confirms the absence of any methylene groups in the structure.\n\n    Now, let's sum the protons:\n    Total H = (aromatic H) + (vinyl H) + (methyl H)\n    Total H = 4 + 2 + 6 = 12 hydrogens.\n\n    This result immediately allows us to eliminate the options with 14 hydrogens.\n    *   B) C11H14O2 is incorrect.\n    *   D) C12H14O2 is incorrect.\n\n    The correct formula must be either A) C12H12O2 or C) C11H12O2.\n\n2.  **Analyze the structural fragments to determine the number of carbon atoms.**\n    We can identify the fragments of the molecule from the spectroscopic data and then sum their carbon atoms.\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This is a benzene ring (C6) with two hydrogen atoms replaced by substituents. The carbon framework is C6.\n    *   **Ester group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms an ester group, which has the core structure -COO-. This contributes 1 carbon atom.\n    *   **Vinyl group:** As determined from the NMR splitting patterns (doublet and doublet of quartets), the vinyl protons are part of a propenyl group, -CH=CH-CH3. This fragment contains 3 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Methyl groups:** The NMR shows two -CH3 signals. One belongs to the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3). The other must be part of the ester functional group. There are two common possibilities: a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate group (-OCOCH3).\n        *   In a methyl ester, the second CH3 is attached to the oxygen. The carbons are already counted in the ester's C=O and the methyl group itself.\n        *   In an acetate group, the second CH3 is attached to the carbonyl carbon.\n\n    Let's assemble the most likely structure and count the total carbons.\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring substituted with a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) and a methyl ester group (-COOCH3).

Total = 2 carbons.\n        *   This seems double-counted. Let's count from the fragments that make up the whole molecule:\n            1.  C6H4 ring = 6 carbons\n            2.  Propenyl group, -CH=CH-CH3 = 3 carbons\n            3.  Methyl part of the ester, -OCH3 = 1 carbon\n            4.  Carbonyl part of the ester, C=O = 1 carbon\n        *   Let's recount based on the pieces: The molecule is composed of a propenyl group (C3), a benzene ring (C6), and a methyl carboxylate group (-COOCH3) where one C is the carbonyl and one C is the methyl. So, C3 + C6 + C1(carbonyl) + C1(methyl) = 11 carbons.\n\n    Let's try the other possibility: an acetate group.\n    *   **Structure:** A benzene ring substituted with a propenyl group and an acetate group (-OCOCH3).

(6H)\n    *   **Total Hydrogen Count:** Summing up the protons from all signals gives the total number of hydrogen atoms in the molecule: 4 (aromatic) + 2 (vinyl) + 6 (methyl) = 12 hydrogens.\n\n2.  **Filter the Options Based on the Hydrogen Count:**\n    The molecular formula must have 12 hydrogen atoms. Let's check the given options:\n    A) C11H12O2 (H=12) -> Possible\n    B) C12H12O2 (H=12) -> Possible\n    C) C11H14O2 (H=14) -> Incorrect\n    D) C12H14O2 (H=14) -> Incorrect\n    This eliminates options C and D. We are left with A and B.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Spectroscopic Data to Determine the Structural Fragments and Carbon Count:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This is a `C6H4` group, which contains 6 carbon atoms.\n    *   **FTIR: ester group:** This indicates the presence of a `-COO-` functional group, which contains 1 carbon atom (the carbonyl carbon).\n    *   **1H NMR - Vinyl and Methyl groups:** The description of the vinyl signals (\"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\") is highly characteristic. A doublet of quartets (dq) arises when a proton is coupled to one adjacent proton (giving the doublet) and three other adjacent protons (giving the quartet). This points to a `–CH=CH-CH3` (propenyl) group. The proton on the carbon next to the CH3 group gives the `dq` signal, and the other vinyl proton gives the `d` signal. This propenyl group contains one of the two methyl groups mentioned in the data. The propenyl fragment has 3 carbon atoms.\n    *   **1H NMR - Second Methyl Group:** Since there are two methyl signals, and one is part of the propenyl group, there must be a second, separate `-CH3` group elsewhere in the molecule. This group contains 1 carbon atom.\n    *   **No -CH2 groups:** This confirms that there are no methylene bridges, ethyl groups, or other structures containing `-CH2-`. This constraint is consistent with our fragment identification.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Fragments and Count the Total Carbon Atoms:**\n    The entire molecule is built from the fragments we have identified. We can determine the total number of carbon atoms by summing the carbons from each essential, non-overlapping part of the structure.\n    *   Carbon from the benzene ring (`C6H4`): 6 C\n    *   Carbon from the ester's carbonyl group (`C=O`): 1 C\n    *   Carbons from the propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`): 3 C\n    *   Carbon from the second methyl group (`-CH3`): 1 C\n\n    These fragments must be assembled to form a valid structure, for example, `(CH3-CH=CH)-C6H4-(COOCH3)`. Regardless of the exact arrangement (e.g., it could also be `CH3-C6H4-OOC-CH=CH-CH3`), the total number of carbons required to build a molecule with these specific parts is constant.\n\n    Total Carbon Count = 6 (ring) + 1 (ester C=O) + 3 (propenyl) + 1 (second methyl) = 11 carbons.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The molecule must have 11 carbon atoms and 12 hydrogen atoms. The formula must be C11H12O2. This corresponds to option A. We can also check the degree of unsaturation (DoU) for C11H12O2: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6. This is consistent with a benzene ring (DoU=4), a C=C double bond (DoU=1), and a C=O double bond (DoU=1).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Information into Molecular Fragments:**\n\n*   **Structure Core:** The problem states the compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This means we have a benzene ring (C6H6) where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by substituents. The core of this part of the molecule is therefore **C6H4**. The ¹H NMR spectrum shows two signals for aromatic hydrogens, which is characteristic of a symmetrically substituted ring, most likely a para (1,4) substitution.\n\n*   **Functional Group (FTIR):** The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of an **ester group (-COO-)**. This group contains one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms (**C1O2**).\n\n*   **Alkenyl Group (¹H NMR):** The NMR spectrum shows two signals for vinyl hydrogens (protons on a C=C double bond). The splitting pattern is described as \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\".\n    *   A **doublet of quartets (dq)** indicates a proton that is coupled to one adjacent proton (giving the doublet) and also to three equivalent protons (giving the quartet). This is a classic pattern for a proton in a `-CH=CH-CH3` group, specifically the one attached to the same carbon as the methyl group (`-CH-CH3`).\n    *   A **doublet (d)** would then correspond to the other vinyl proton (`-CH=`), which is only coupled to the first vinyl proton.\n    *   This evidence strongly points to the presence of a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**. This fragment accounts for three carbons and five hydrogens (**C3H5**).\n\n*   **Alkyl Groups (¹H NMR):** The NMR spectrum shows two signals for -CH3 groups.\n    *   One of these methyl groups is part of the propenyl group (-CH=CH-**CH3**) we just identified.\n    *   Therefore, there must be a second, distinct **methyl group (-CH3)** elsewhere in the molecule. This fragment contributes one carbon and three hydrogens (**C1H3**).\n\n*   **Absence of Other Groups (¹H NMR):** The problem explicitly states there are **no signals for -CH2 groups**. This is a critical piece of information that rules out structures containing ethyl, propyl, or other similar alkyl chains.\n\n**2. Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Molecular Formula:**\n\nNow, we sum the atoms from all the identified fragments to determine the overall molecular formula.\n\n*   **Carbon (C) atoms:**\n    *   From the aromatic ring (C6H4): 6 C\n    *   From the ester group (-COO-): 1 C\n    *   From the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3): 3 C\n    *   From the second methyl group (-CH3): 1 C\n    *   **Total Carbon = 6 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 11 C**\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H) atoms:**\n    *   From the aromatic ring (C6H4): 4 H\n    *   From the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3): 5 H\n    *   From the second methyl group (-CH3): 3 H\n    *   **Total Hydrogen = 4 + 5 + 3 = 12 H**\n\n*   **Oxygen (O) atoms:**\n    *   From the ester group (-COO-): 2 O\n    *   **Total Oxygen = 2 O**\n\nPutting it all together, the molecular formula of the compound is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**3. Verify the Conclusion:**\n\n*   The calculated formula, C11H12O2, matches one of the given options.\n*   We can also check the degree of unsaturation (DoU) for C11H12O2 to ensure it is consistent with our proposed structure.\n    *   DoU formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`\n    *   DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**\n*   The required structural features are a benzene ring (DoU = 4), a C=C double bond (DoU = 1), and a C=O double bond (DoU = 1). The total required DoU is 4 + 1 + 1 = 6. The calculated DoU for the formula C11H12O2 matches the structural requirements perfectly.\n*   The other chemical formulas provided are inconsistent with the spectroscopic data. For example, C11H14O2 (DoU=5) would lack the vinyl C=C bond, and C12H14O2 (DoU=6) would require adding a CH2 group, which is explicitly absent.\n\nTherefore, the correct chemical formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nThe user wants me to identify the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on several pieces of spectroscopic data. I will break down each piece of information to determine the constituent atoms.\n\n1.  **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**:\n    *   A benzene ring has the formula C6H6.\n    *   If it is di-substituted, two hydrogen atoms are replaced by other groups.\n    *   This leaves a **C6H4** fragment.\n    *   Running tally: C=6, H=4\n\n2.  **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicates the presence of an ester group\"**:\n    *   An ester group has the functional formula -COO-.\n    *   This adds **2 Oxygen atoms** and **1 Carbon atom** (from the C=O carbonyl).\n    *   Running tally: C=6+1=7, H=4, O=2\n\n3.  **\"1H NMR spectrum shows six signals\"**: This provides information about the hydrogen atoms and their neighboring groups.\n\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\"**: This confirms the C6H4 fragment. The four hydrogens are in two different chemical environments (which is consistent with ortho or para substitution), giving rise to two distinct signals. We have already accounted for these 4 hydrogens.\n\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\"**: Vinyl-H are protons attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n        *   A signal that is a \"doublet of quartets\" (dq) is highly characteristic of a proton on a double bond that is adjacent to both another proton on the double bond and a methyl group. This points strongly to a propenyl group fragment: **-CH=CH-CH3**.\n        *   Let's verify the splitting: The H atom on the carbon next to the CH3 group (`=CH-CH3`) is split by the other vinyl H (into a doublet) and by the three protons of the CH3 group (into a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. The other vinyl H (`-CH=`) is split only by its vinyl neighbor, resulting in a doublet. This perfectly matches the description.\n        *   This fragment (-CH=CH-CH3) contains **3 Carbon atoms** and **5 Hydrogen atoms** (1+1+3=5).\n        *   Running tally: C=7+3=10, H=4+5=9, O=2\n\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups\"**:\n        *   We have already identified one CH3 group as part of the propenyl fragment. The data states there are *two* signals for CH3 groups, so there must be another one.\n        *   This second methyl group (**-CH3**) must be attached somewhere else in the molecule, likely as part of the ester (e.g., -COOCH3) or attached to the aromatic ring.\n        *   This fragment adds **1 Carbon atom** and **3 Hydrogen atoms**.\n        *   Running tally: C=10+1=11, H=9+3=12, O=2\n\n    *   **\"no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups\"**: This is a useful piece of negative information, confirming we are not missing any methylene (-CH2-) units.\n\n**Final Calculation**\n\n*   **Carbon (C)**: 6 (from aromatic ring) + 1 (from ester carbonyl) + 3 (from propenyl group) + 1 (from second methyl group) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogen (H)**: 4 (from aromatic ring) + 5 (from propenyl group) + 3 (from second methyl group) = **12**\n*   **Oxygen (O)**: 2 (from ester group) = **2**\n\nThe deduced chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\nThis matches option C from the choices provided.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\n*   **Step 1: Analyze the provided spectroscopic data to identify functional groups and structural fragments.**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents attached. The base formula for this core is C6H4. The presence of a ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (DOU).\n    *   **FTIR: \"ester group\"**: This indicates the presence of a -COO- functional group. The C=O bond in the ester adds 1 DOU.\n    *   **1H NMR signals**:\n        *   **\"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\"**: A di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4) has 4 protons. The fact that they appear as two signals suggests an ortho or meta substitution pattern with different substituents, or a para substitution. This is consistent with the C6H4 core.\n        *   **\"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\"**: Vinyl protons are hydrogens attached to a C=C double bond. This splitting pattern is highly characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) attached to a group with no protons on the adjacent atom (like the aromatic ring).\n            *   Let's label the group: Ring-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3.\n            *   The signal for H(a) is split only by H(b), so it appears as a doublet.\n            *   The signal for H(b) is split by H(a) (giving a doublet) and by the three protons of the -CH3 group (giving a quartet). The resulting signal is a doublet of quartets.\n            *   This confirms the presence of a propenyl group, -C3H5. This group also contains a C=C double bond, which adds 1 DOU.\n        *   **\"two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups\"**: One -CH3 group is accounted for by the propenyl substituent (-CH=CH-CH3). The second -CH3 signal must belong to the ester group.\n        *   **\"no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups\"**: This is a crucial constraint. It means the ester cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) or have any other alkyl chain longer than a methyl group. Combined with the presence of a second -CH3 signal, this strongly points to the ester being either a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate (-OCOCH3). In both cases, this fragment has the formula C2H3O2.\n\n*   **Step 2: Assemble the identified fragments to determine the molecular formula.**\n    *   Aromatic core: C6H4\n    *   Substituent 1 (propenyl): -CH=CH-CH3, which has the formula C3H5.\n    *   Substituent 2 (ester part): -COOCH3 or -OCOCH3, both having the formula C2H3O2.\n    *   Now, we sum the atoms from these parts to find the total molecular formula:\n        *   Carbon atoms: 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from ester) = 11 carbons.\n        *   Hydrogen atoms: 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from ester) = 12 hydrogens.\n        *   Oxygen atoms: 2 (from ester) = 2 oxygens.\n    *   The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Verify the result by checking the Degrees of Unsaturation (DOU).**\n    *   The structural features identified are: 1 benzene ring (4 DOU), 1 C=C double bond (1 DOU), and 1 C=O double bond (1 DOU).\n    *   Total expected DOU = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n    *   Let's calculate the DOU from the derived formula, C11H12O2, using the formula DOU = C + 1 - H/2.\n    *   DOU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    *   The calculated DOU matches the expected DOU from the structure, confirming our assignment.\n\n*   **Step 4: Compare the derived formula with the given options.**\n    *   A) C12H12O2 (DOU = 7)\n    *   B) C11H14O2 (DOU = 5)\n    *   C) C11H12O2 (DOU = 6)\n    *   D) C12H14O2 (DOU = 6)\n    *   Our derived formula, C11H12O2, matches option C. The other options are inconsistent. For instance, C12H14O2 has the correct DOU, but building a molecule with that formula that also matches the NMR data (no CH2, only two CH3 signals) is not possible. Adding a CH3 to C11H12O2 would necessitate removing an H, creating C12H14O2, but would result in three CH3 signals, which contradicts the data.\n\nTherefore, the chemical formula of the unknown compound must be C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the given spectroscopic data:**\n    *   **FTIR Spectrum:** Indicates the presence of an ester group (-COO-). This accounts for the two oxygen atoms in the molecular formula options.\n    *   **Structure Core:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we have a benzene ring (C6) with two substituents. The base formula for the ring itself, after substitution, is C6H4, assuming the two substituents replace two hydrogen atoms. The 1H NMR data, showing two signals for aromatic hydrogens, strongly suggests a 1,4- (para) substitution pattern, which would have this C6H4 core.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the 1H NMR signals:** The spectrum shows six signals in total. Let's identify the groups responsible for these signals.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** This corresponds to the 4 protons on the di-substituted benzene ring (C6**H4**). A 1,4-disubstituted ring would give two signals for two protons each (typically two doublets), which fits this description.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H:** This indicates a C=C double bond outside the aromatic ring.\n        *   Signal 1: A doublet.\n        *   Signal 2: A doublet of quartets.\n        *   This specific splitting pattern (d and dq) is a classic signature for a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`). The proton on the carbon attached to the ring is split by the other vinyl proton (giving a doublet). The other vinyl proton is split by the first vinyl proton (doublet) and the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. This group has the formula **C3H5**.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:**\n        *   One of these signals belongs to the methyl group of the propenyl (`-CH=CH-CH3`) group we just identified. This methyl group's signal would be a doublet due to splitting by the adjacent vinyl proton.\n        *   The second –CH3 signal must belong to another part of the molecule. Since we know there's an ester, this is likely a methyl group attached to the ester, either as a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate group (`-O-CO-CH3`). In either case, it's a **CH3** group. This signal would appear as a singlet as it has no adjacent protons.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a crucial piece of information. It confirms that there are no ethyl, propyl (other than propenyl), or other methylene-containing chains in the molecule.\n\n3.  **Assemble the molecular structure and determine the formula:**\n    Let's assemble the pieces we have identified:\n    *   A di-substituted benzene ring core: **C6H4**\n    *   A propenyl substituent: **C3H5**\n    *   An ester group containing a methyl group. Let's analyze the two possibilities for the ester substituent:\n        *   Possibility A: A methyl ester group, `-COOCH3`. This has the formula **C2H3O2**.\n        *   Possibility B: An acetoxy group, `-OCOCH3`. This also has the formula **C2H3O2**.\n\n    Now, we sum the atoms from the core (C6H4) and the two substituents (the C3H5 group and the C2H3O2 group) to find the total molecular formula.\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from ester part) = 11\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from methyl of ester) = 12\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from ester) = 2\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Verify with the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    The DoU formula is `DoU = C + 1 - H/2`.\n    For C11H12O2, DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    Let's check the DoU from the proposed structure:\n    *   1 for the benzene ring.\n    *   3 for the double bonds within the benzene ring.\n    *   1 for the vinyl C=C double bond.\n    *   1 for the ester C=O double bond.\n    *   Total DoU = 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n    The DoU matches, confirming the formula is consistent with the structural features.\n\n5.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    The calculated formula C11H12O2 matches option D. The other options are incorrect:\n    *   C12H14O2 and C12H12O2 have the wrong carbon count.\n    *   C11H14O2 has too many hydrogens, which would mean a lower degree of unsaturation (DoU = 5), contradicting the presence of the aromatic ring, a vinyl group, and a carbonyl group.\n    *   Furthermore, any option with more than 12 hydrogens or containing a -CH2- unit would contradict the NMR data. For example, C11H14O2 would likely arise from reducing the C=C bond of the propenyl group to a C-C bond (propyl group, -CH2CH2CH3), but this would eliminate the vinyl signals and introduce two CH2 signals.\n\nTherefore, the only possible formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nThis is a classic structure elucidation problem that can be solved by systematically piecing together the information from the provided spectra.\n\n**1.

Sum the Hydrogens:**\n\nBy adding up the protons from all the identified fragments, we can determine the total number of hydrogens in the molecule.\nTotal H = 4 (aromatic) + 2 (vinyl) + 6 (methyl) = **12 H**\n\nNow, we can compare this with the options provided:\nA) C11H14O2 (14 H) - Incorrect.\nB) C12H14O2 (14 H) - Incorrect.\nC) C11H12O2 (12 H) - **Possible**.\nD) C12H12O2 (12 H) - **Possible**.\n\nThis analysis narrows the choice down to C or D.\n\n**3.

Given the presence of an ester and the constraint of \"no -CH2- groups\", the most likely position for this methyl is as the alkyl part of a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or the acetyl part of a phenyl acetate-type ester (`-O-CO-CH3`). In either case, this methyl group would be a singlet as it has no adjacent protons.\n            *   This confirms the presence of two distinct methyl groups.\n        *   **No -CH2 signals:** This is a key constraint that confirms our proposed fragments, as neither a propenyl group, a methyl ester group, nor a phenyl acetate-type group contain any `-CH2-` (methylene) units.\n\n2.  **Assemble the molecular structure from the fragments:**\n    *   **Core:** C6H4 (di-substituted benzene ring).\n    *   **Substituent 1:** `-CH=CH-CH3` (propenyl group).\n    *   **Substituent 2:** An ester group containing a methyl group, e.g., `-COOCH3` (methyl ester group).\n    *   Let's check if this structure (a propenyl methylbenzoate) fits all the data.\n        *   It is a di-substituted aromatic ring.\n        *   It contains an ester.\n        *   The NMR signals match perfectly (2 aromatic, 2 vinyl, 2 methyl).\n        *   It has no -CH2- groups.\n        *   The total number of 1H NMR signals would be 2 (aromatic) + 2 (vinyl) + 2 (methyl) = 6 signals. This matches the given information.\n\n3.  **Calculate the total number of protons:**\n    *   From the ring (C6H4): 4 H\n    *   From the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3): 1 + 1 + 3 = 5 H\n    *   From the methyl ester group (-COOCH3): 3 H\n    *   Total Hydrogen atoms = 4 + 5 + 3 = 12 H.\n    *   This immediately eliminates options with H14 (A and D). We are left with B (C12H12O2) and C (C11H12O2).\n\n4.  **Calculate the number of Carbon and Oxygen atoms:**\n    *   From the ring (C6H4): 6 C\n    *   From the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3): 3 C\n    *   From the methyl ester group (-COOCH3): 1 C (from C=O) + 1 C (from O-CH3) = 2 C\n    *   From the ester group (-COO-): 2 O\n    *   Total Carbon atoms = 6 + 3 + 2 = 11 C.\n    *   Total Oxygen atoms = 2 O.\n\n5.  **Determine the Final Chemical Formula:**\n    *   Based on the atom count, the chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n6.  **Verify with other possibilities and Degree of Unsaturation (DBU):**\n    *   The alternative ester structure, propenyl phenyl acetate (`CH3CO-O-C6H4-CH=CHCH3`), also gives the formula C11H12O2. So regardless of the exact isomer, the formula is the same.\n    *   The DBU for C11H12O2 is `11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6`. This is consistent with a benzene ring (4 DBUs), one C=C double bond (1 DBU), and one C=O double bond (1 DBU).\n    *   The formula C12H12O2 would have a DBU of 7. It is not possible to add another DBU (e.g., another ring or double bond) and an extra Carbon to our structure without violating the strict NMR rules provided.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to identify the correct chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Functional Groups and Core Structure:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This tells us we have a benzene ring with two things attached to it. The core formula for this part is `C6H4`. The ring itself accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (DBE).\n    *   **FTIR indicates an ester group:** The molecule contains a `-COO-` functional group. This accounts for the two oxygen atoms present in all the options and adds one more degree of unsaturation due to the `C=O` bond.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons (`C6H4`). These 4 protons giving two signals is very common, for example in a para-substituted ring where you would see two doublets. This confirms the `C6H4` fragment.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets):** This is highly informative about one of the substituents.\n        *   A \"quartet\" (`q`) splitting means a proton is adjacent to a `-CH3` group.\n        *   A \"doublet\" (`d`) splitting means a proton is adjacent to a single other proton.\n        *   Therefore, a \"doublet of quartets\" (`dq`) describes a proton (`Hb`) that is adjacent to both another single proton (`Ha`) and a `-CH3` group. The other vinyl proton (`Ha`) being a simple \"doublet\" confirms it's only adjacent to `Hb`.\n        *   This splitting pattern uniquely identifies a **propenyl group**: `(-CHa=CHb-CH3)`. This fragment has the formula `C3H5` and adds one more degree of unsaturation from the `C=C` bond.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:** We have identified one `-CH3` group as part of the propenyl substituent. The presence of a second `-CH3` signal means there is another, chemically distinct `-CH3` group elsewhere in the molecule.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a crucial piece of negative evidence. It rules out any ethyl (`-CH2CH3`), propyl (`-CH2CH2CH3`), or other groups containing a `CH2` moiety.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Formula:**\n    Let's collect all the mandatory pieces of the molecule we've identified from the spectra:\n    *   From the aromatic ring: `C6H4`\n    *   From the vinyl and one methyl signal: a propenyl group `C3H5` (`-CH=CH-CH3`)\n    *   From the second methyl signal: another `-CH3` group\n    *   From the ester functionality: a `-COO-` group, which contains one carbon (`C`) and two oxygens (`O2`).\n\n    Now, let's sum the atoms from these fragments to find the total molecular formula:\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from `C6H4`) + 3 (from `C3H5`) + 1 (from `-CH3`) + 1 (from `-COO-`) = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from `C6H4`) + 5 (from `C3H5`) + 3 (from `-CH3`) = **12**\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from `-COO-`) = **2**\n\n    The molecular formula is therefore **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Verify Against Other Options:**\n    *   **C11H12O2 (Our result):** Degrees of Unsaturation (DBE) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6. This matches our structural analysis (Ring=4 + C=O=1 + C=C=1 = 6 DBE). This is consistent.\n    *   **C11H14O2:** DBE = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 5. This is inconsistent with the presence of an aromatic ring, an ester, *and* a vinyl group, which requires 6 DBE.\n    *   **C12H14O2:** DBE = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 6. While the DBE is correct, to get from our required C11H12O2 structure to C12H14O2, one must add a `CH2` group. The NMR data explicitly states there are no `-CH2-` groups. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n    *   **C12H12O2:** DBE = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7. This would require an additional double bond or ring compared to the structure indicated by the spectra, which is not supported by the data.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only chemical formula that fits all the provided spectroscopic evidence is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the given information from the problem description:**\n\n*   **Structure:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This implies a benzene ring with two substituents, formula C6H4.\n*   **FTIR Spectroscopy:** An ester group (-COO-) is present. This accounts for the two oxygen atoms seen in all the chemical formula options.\n*   **1H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** For a di-substituted benzene ring, having only two signals for the four aromatic protons strongly suggests a symmetrical `para` (1,4) substitution pattern. An `ortho` or `meta` substitution would typically result in four distinct signals for the four aromatic protons. So, we have a `p-C6H4` group (4 hydrogens).\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is characteristic of a `-CH=CH-CH3` group.\n        *   The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and by the three methyl protons (creating a quartet), resulting in a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n        *   The other vinyl proton is only split by the first vinyl proton, resulting in a **doublet (d)**.\n        *   This fragment has the formula `C3H5` (2 vinyl-H + 3 methyl-H).\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:** One methyl signal comes from the `-CH=CH-CH3` group identified above. The second signal must correspond to another, chemically distinct methyl group somewhere else in the molecule.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a key constraint that eliminates any structures containing a methylene bridge or an ethyl group, for example.\n\n**2. Assemble the molecular fragments:**\n\nBased on the analysis, we have the following pieces of the molecule:\n*   A para-substituted benzene ring: **-C6H4-**\n*   An ester group: **-COO-**\n*   A propenyl group: **-CH=CH-CH3**\n*   A second, distinct methyl group: **-CH3**\n\n**3. Construct a valid chemical structure:**\n\nWe need to combine these fragments into a single molecule that respects all the given information. The molecule has two substituents on the benzene ring. Let's consider the possibilities for forming the ester and placing the substituents.\n\n*   **Possibility A: Methyl benzoate derivative**\n    *   One substituent on the ring is the propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`).\n    *   The other substituent is a methyl ester group (`-COO-CH3`). This uses the ester fragment and the second methyl group.\n    *   The resulting structure is **methyl p-propenylbenzoate**: `CH3-CH=CH-C6H4-COO-CH3`.\n    *   This structure fits all the data: it's para-substituted, has a propenyl group with the correct NMR signature, has two distinct methyl groups, and crucially, has no `-CH2-` groups.\n\n*   **Possibility B: Phenyl acetate derivative**\n    *   One substituent is the propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`).\n    *   The other substituent is an acetoxy group (`-O-CO-CH3`). This uses the ester and the second methyl group.\n    *   The resulting structure is **p-propenylphenyl acetate**: `CH3-CH=CH-C6H4-O-CO-CH3`.\n    *   This structure also fits all the given spectroscopic data.\n\n**4. Determine the Chemical Formula:**\n\nNow, let's calculate the chemical formula for the valid structures we've proposed. Both possibilities will lead to the same formula. We will use Possibility A for the calculation.\n\n*   **Carbon atoms (C):**\n    *   From the benzene ring (C6H4): 6\n    *   From the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3): 3\n    *   From the ester carbonyl group (-COO-): 1\n    *   From the ester methyl group (-OCH3): 1\n    *   **Total Carbons = 6 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 11**\n\n*   **Hydrogen atoms (H):**\n    *   From the aromatic ring (C6H4): 4\n    *   From the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3): 5\n    *   From the ester methyl group (-OCH3): 3\n    *   **Total Hydrogens = 4 + 5 + 3 = 12**\n\n*   **Oxygen atoms (O):**\n    *   From the ester group (-COO-): 2\n    *   **Total Oxygens = 2**\n\nCombining these, the chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**5. Conclusion:**\n\nThe derived chemical formula C11H12O2 matches one of the given options. Other options are incorrect. For example, C12H12O2 has an extra carbon which cannot be added without violating the NMR data, and C11H14O2/C12H14O2 have too many hydrogens, which would imply saturation of the C=C bond, contradicting the presence of vinyl-H signals.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Information Provided\n\n*   **Structure:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This typically refers to a benzene ring with two substituents, so we have a C6H4 core.\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** An absorption peak indicates an ester group (-COO-). This tells us the molecule contains at least two oxygen atoms.\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum:** The spectrum provides crucial details about the hydrogen environments in the molecule.\n    *   **Six signals total:** This indicates six chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4) has four aromatic protons. Having only two signals suggests a high degree of symmetry, which is characteristic of a **1,4-disubstitution (para)** pattern. In this pattern, there are two sets of two equivalent protons, leading to two signals (typically two doublets).\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (alkene protons):**\n        *   One signal is a **doublet (d)**.\n        *   The other is a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n        *   This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**. The vinyl proton adjacent to the other vinyl proton is split into a doublet. The other vinyl proton is split by both the adjacent vinyl proton (into a doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (into a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. This identifies one of the substituents as `-CH=CH-CH3`.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:**\n        *   One methyl signal comes from the propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`) identified above.\n        *   The second methyl signal must be part of the ester group. Common ester functionalities involving a methyl group are a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate (`-OCOCH3`). Both possibilities provide a second, distinct methyl signal.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a key constraint, ruling out structures containing ethyl, propyl, or allyl (`-CH2-CH=CH2`) groups.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (also known as double bond equivalents) can be calculated from the structural features:\n*   Benzene ring: Contains 1 ring and 3 double bonds = 4 DBE\n*   Ester group (-COO-): Contains one C=O double bond = 1 DBE\n*   Vinyl group (-CH=CH-): Contains one C=C double bond = 1 DBE\n\n**Total DBE from structure = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6**\n\nNow, let's calculate the DBE for each of the given chemical formulas using the formula: DBE = C + 1 - (H/2).\n*   A) C11H14O2: DBE = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 12 - 7 = 5\n*   B) C12H14O2: DBE = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 13 - 7 = 6\n*   C) C11H12O2: DBE = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6\n*   D) C12H12O2: DBE = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 13 - 6 = 7\n\nComparing the DBE values, we can immediately rule out options A and D, as their DBEs (5 and 7, respectively) do not match the required DBE of 6. This leaves C11H12O2 and C12H14O2 as possibilities.\n\n### 3. Assemble the Molecule and Determine the Formula\n\nWe can now build the molecule from the fragments identified from the spectroscopic data and sum the atoms to find the correct formula.\n\n*   **Fragment 1: Aromatic Ring**\n    *   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring has the formula **C6H4**.\n*   **Fragment 2: Vinyl Substituent**\n    *   The propenyl group that fits the NMR data is `-CH=CH-CH3`. As a substituent, it has the formula **-C3H5**. (1 vinyl H + 1 vinyl H + 3 methyl H = 5 H).\n*   **Fragment 3: Ester Substituent**\n    *   This substituent must contain the ester functionality (`-COO-`) and the second methyl group.\n    *   Option 1: Methyl ester group, `-COOCH3`. This has the formula **-C2H3O2**.\n    *   Option 2: Acetate group attached via oxygen, `-OCOCH3`. This also has the formula **-C2H3O2**.\n    *   Both these fragments are consistent with the \"no -CH2-\" rule.\n\nNow, let's combine the atoms from these fragments:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from -C3H5) + 2 (from -C2H3O2) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from -C3H5) + 3 (from -C2H3O2) = **12**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from the ester group) = **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\nThis formula is fully consistent with all the provided data: it corresponds to a plausible structure (e.g., methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate), matches the detailed NMR signals, contains an ester group, is di-substituted, has no -CH2- groups, and has the correct degree of unsaturation (DBE = 6).\n\nThe other possibility, C12H14O2, can be ruled out because it is impossible to construct a molecule with this formula that satisfies all the specific NMR constraints (particularly the fragments identified and the absence of -CH2- groups).\n\n### 4. Final Conclusion\n\nThe spectroscopic evidence strongly and uniquely points to the molecular formula C11H12O2.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 49:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the given information:**\n    *   **Structure:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This indicates a C6H4 benzene core.\n    *   **FTIR:** An ester group (-COO-) is present. This means the molecule contains 2 oxygen atoms. All options (C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2) are consistent with this.\n    *   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n        *   **Aromatic-H:** Two signals. For a di-substituted benzene ring, two signals typically imply a para-substitution pattern, where there are two sets of chemically equivalent protons. This would account for a total of 4 aromatic protons.\n        *   **Vinyl-H:** Two signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets). This is a very characteristic splitting pattern for a prop-1-en-yl group (-CH=CH-CH3). The vinyl proton adjacent to the ring is split only by the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet). The other vinyl proton is split by both the first vinyl proton (doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. This group contributes C3H5 to the formula and accounts for two vinyl protons and one methyl group.\n        *   **-CH3 Groups:** Two signals. One -CH3 group is from the prop-1-en-yl group identified above. The second -CH3 signal must belong to the ester functionality.\n        *   **No -CH2 Groups:** The molecule does not contain any methylene (-CH2) groups. This is a crucial constraint.\n\n2.  **Deduce the structure of the substituents:**\n    *   **Substituent 1:** Based on the vinyl-H signals, one substituent is a prop-1-en-yl group: `-CH=CH-CH3`. This has the formula C3H5.\n    *   **Substituent 2:** This must be an ester group and contain the second -CH3 group, but no -CH2 groups. The simplest possibilities are:\n        *   A methyl ester group: `-COOCH3`. This has the formula C2H3O2 and contains a methyl group with no methylene group.\n        *   An acetate group attached via oxygen: `-O-CO-CH3`. This also has the formula C2H3O2 and fits the criteria.\n\n3.  **Assemble a plausible molecular structure and determine its formula:**\n    Let's combine the parts:\n    *   Benzene core: C6H4\n    *   Substituent 1 (propenyl): C3H5\n    *   Substituent 2 (ester part): C2H3O2 (from either -COOCH3 or -O-CO-CH3)\n\n    Now, let's sum the atoms to find the total chemical formula:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5) + 2 (from C2H3O2) = 11 carbons.\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from C3H5) + 3 (from C2H3O2) = 12 hydrogens.\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from C2H3O2) = 2 oxygens.\n\n    The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**. This perfectly matches all the spectroscopic data. For example, methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate has this formula and fits every detail from the NMR spectrum.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the other options using the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    The DBE (also known as the index of hydrogen deficiency) can be calculated using the formula: `DBE = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    The expected DBE for our deduced structure is:\n    *   Benzene ring = 4 (1 ring + 3 double bonds)\n    *   Vinyl C=C double bond = 1\n    *   Ester C=O double bond = 1\n    *   **Total Expected DBE = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6**\n\n    Now let's calculate the DBE for each option provided:\n    *   A) C12H14O2: DBE = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 13 - 7 = 6. (DBE matches, but constructing a structure that fits the strict NMR data - particularly \"no CH2\" and only \"two CH3 signals\" - is not possible).\n    *   B) C11H14O2: DBE = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 12 - 7 = 5. (DBE is too low. It cannot account for a benzene ring, a C=C bond, and a C=O bond).\n    *   C) C12H12O2: DBE = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 13 - 6 = 7. (DBE is too high. This would require an additional ring or double bond, which is inconsistent with the NMR data).\n    *   D) C11H12O2: DBE = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6. (DBE matches perfectly).\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_dbe(formula):\n        \"\"\"Calculates the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) for a given chemical formula CxHyOz.\"\"\"\n        import re\n        parts = re.match(r'C(\\d+)H(\\d+)O(\\d+)', formula)\n        if not parts:\n            return f\"Invalid formula format: {formula}\"\n        C = int(parts.group(1))\n        H = int(parts.group(2))\n        dbe = C - (H / 2) + 1\n        return dbe\n\n    formulas = {\n        \"A\": \"C12H14O2\",\n        \"B\": \"C11H14O2\",\n        \"C\": \"C12H12O2\",\n        \"D\": \"C11H12O2\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"Expected DBE based on structure: Ring(4) + C=C(1) + C=O(1) = 6\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    for option, formula in formulas.items():\n        dbe = calculate_dbe(formula)\n        print(f\"Option {option}: {formula}, DBE = {int(dbe)}\")\n    ```\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The structural analysis points directly to the formula C11H12O2. The DBE calculation confirms that C11H12O2 (DBE=6) is a perfect fit, while options B (DBE=5) and C (DBE=7) are inconsistent with the required structural features. Although option A (C12H14O2) also has the correct DBE of 6, it is impossible to construct a molecule with this formula that also satisfies the very specific NMR constraints (di-substituted, no -CH2 groups, and exactly two -CH3 signals). Therefore, the only correct answer is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Skeleton:**\n    *   The compound is described as a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" This means we have a benzene ring (C6) with two other groups attached to it. Since it's di-substituted, there are four protons (4H) remaining on the ring.\n    *   The presence of a benzene ring contributes 4 degrees of unsaturation (DoU) to the molecule (1 for the ring, 3 for the double bonds).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Functional Groups from FTIR and NMR:**\n    *   **FTIR:** An absorption peak indicates an **ester group** (-COO-). An ester contains a carbonyl group (C=O), which adds 1 more degree of unsaturation.\n    *   **1H NMR - Vinyl Protons:** There are two signals for vinyl protons (hydrogens on a C=C double bond).\n        *   One signal is a **doublet (d)**, which means it's coupled to only one other proton.\n        *   The other signal is a **doublet of quartets (dq)**. This is a key piece of information. \"Doublet\" means coupling to one adjacent proton. \"Quartet\" means coupling to three equivalent adjacent protons, which is characteristic of a methyl (-CH3) group.\n        *   This splitting pattern (d and dq) is classic for a **propenyl group** (-CH=CH-CH3).\n            *   Let's denote it as -CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3.\n            *   H(a) is split by H(b) into a doublet.\n            *   H(b) is split by H(a) (doublet) and by the three protons of the -CH3 group (quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets.\n        *   So, we have a `-CH=CH-CH3` substituent. This contains a C=C double bond, which adds another degree of unsaturation. It also accounts for two vinyl protons and one methyl group.\n    *   **1H NMR - Methyl Protons:** The spectrum shows **two signals for -CH3 groups**.\n        *   We have already identified one -CH3 group as part of the propenyl substituent.\n        *   Therefore, there must be a second, chemically different -CH3 group somewhere else in the molecule.\n    *   **1H NMR - No -CH2 groups:** This is a crucial constraint. The final structure cannot contain any methylene (-CH2-) groups.\n    *   **1H NMR - Aromatic Protons:** There are **two signals for aromatic-H**. This is consistent with a di-substituted benzene ring (which has 4 aromatic protons), particularly a para (1,4) substitution pattern with two different substituents, which typically gives two doublets (two signals).\n\n3.  **Count the Hydrogens based on NMR signals:**\n    *   Aromatic protons: A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 H.\n    *   Vinyl protons: The -CH=CH- fragment has 2 H.\n    *   Methyl protons: There are two -CH3 groups, so 2 * 3 = 6 H.\n    *   Total number of hydrogens = 4 (aromatic) + 2 (vinyl) + 6 (methyl) = **12 H**.\n    *   This immediately eliminates options C (C12H14O2) and D (C11H14O2), as they have 14 hydrogens. We are left with A (C12H12O2) and B (C11H12O2).\n\n4.  **Assemble the Fragments and Count the Carbons:**\n    *   We have the following pieces of the molecule:\n        1.  A di-substituted benzene ring core: **C6H4**\n        2.  A propenyl group: **-CH=CH-CH3** (which is C3H5)\n        3.  An ester group (-COO-) that incorporates the second methyl group and has no -CH2- groups. The only simple possibilities are an acetate group (`-O-CO-CH3`) or a methyl ester group (`-CO-O-CH3`). Both of these fragments are **C2H3O2**.\n\n    *   Now, let's assemble these fragments. The two substituents on the C6H4 ring must be the propenyl group and the ester-containing group.\n    *   Let's sum the number of carbons from these identified fragments:\n        *   Carbons in the benzene ring: 6\n        *   Carbons in the propenyl group: 3\n        *   Carbons in the ester-methyl fragment (-OCOCH3 or -COOCH3): 2\n    *   Total number of carbons = 6 + 3 + 2 = **11 C**.\n\n5.  **Determine the Final Formula:**\n    *   Based on our analysis, the molecule contains 11 carbon atoms, 12 hydrogen atoms, and 2 oxygen atoms (from the ester group).\n    *   The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n6.  **Verify with Degrees of Unsaturation:**\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for C11H12O2: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**.\n    *   Let's count the DoU from our deduced structure: 4 (for the benzene ring) + 1 (for the C=C in the propenyl group) + 1 (for the C=O in the ester group) = **6**.\n    *   The DoU calculation matches our structural deduction, confirming that C11H12O2 is the correct formula.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\nThe user has confirmed the output of the previous code execution. The reasoning process is as follows:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Molecule Based on Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This means we start with a benzene ring (C6H6) and replace two hydrogens with substituents. This leaves us with a **C6H4** fragment.\n    *   **FTIR shows an ester group:** The ester functional group contains **-COO-**. This adds 1 Carbon and 2 Oxygens.\n    *   **1H NMR - Aromatic-H:** \"Two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\" is consistent with the C6H4 fragment, suggesting a symmetrical substitution like para- (1,4-) substitution.\n    *   **1H NMR - Vinyl-H:** This is the most informative part. We have two vinyl protons. One is a doublet, meaning it's coupled to just one other proton. The other is a doublet of quartets, meaning it's coupled to one proton (giving the doublet) and a group of three equivalent protons (giving the quartet). This classic pattern identifies a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**.\n        *   The proton on the carbon attached to the ring is split by the other vinyl proton into a doublet.\n        *   The other vinyl proton is split by the first vinyl proton (doublet) and the adjacent methyl group (quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets.\n        *   This propenyl group contributes **C3H5** (3 carbons, 5 hydrogens).\n    *   **1H NMR - –CH3 groups:** \"Two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups.\" We already identified one from the propenyl group. The second -CH3 group must be part of the ester. This gives us either a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate (-OCOCH3). Both possibilities contribute one methyl group. Let's take the methyl ester fragment for calculation: **-COOCH3**. This adds a C and a CH3 to the -COO- core identified from the FTIR. So this fragment is **C2H3O2**.\n    *   **1H NMR - No –CH2 groups:** The fragments we've identified (C6H4, -CH=CH-CH3, and -COOCH3) contain no -CH2- (methylene) groups, which perfectly matches this constraint.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Formula from the Fragments:**\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5) + 2 (from C2H3O2) = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from C3H5) + 3 (from C2H3O2) = **12**\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group C2H3O2) = **2**\n\n3.  **Final Molecular Formula:**\n    The derived molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Match with Options:**\n    Comparing C11H12O2 with the given options:\n    *   A) C11H14O2\n    *   B) C11H12O2\n    *   C) C12H12O2\n    *   D) C12H14O2\n\nThe calculated formula matches option B. The code output `C11H12O2` confirms this calculation.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the given information:**\n    *   **Molecular Features:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This strongly suggests a benzene ring (C6H6) where two hydrogen atoms are replaced by substituents, giving a C6H4 core.\n    *   **FTIR Spectroscopy:** An ester group is present. The general structure of an ester is R-COO-R', which contains a carbonyl group (C=O) and a C-O single bond.\n    *   **1H NMR Spectroscopy:** This is the most detailed information for structure elucidation.\n        *   **Six total signals:** Indicates six chemically distinct types of protons.\n        *   **Two aromatic-H signals:** For a di-substituted benzene ring, having only two signals for the four aromatic protons is characteristic of a *para* (1,4) substitution pattern, especially with two electronically different substituents. This accounts for 4 protons (C6**H4**).\n        *   **Two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This splitting pattern is a classic signature for a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) attached to a carbon with no hydrogens (like the aromatic ring). Let's denote the group as Ar-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3.\n            *   H(a) is split by H(b), resulting in a doublet. (1H)\n            *   H(b) is split by H(a) (a doublet) and by the three protons of the adjacent CH3 group (a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. (1H)\n            *   This confirms the presence of a **-CH=CH-CH3** group, which contains 1 vinyl H, 1 vinyl H, and 3 methyl H's.\n        *   **Two –CH3 group signals:** This means there are two non-equivalent methyl groups in the molecule. One is the methyl from the propenyl group (-CH=CH-**CH3**). The other must belong to the ester substituent.\n        *   **No –CH2 group signals:** This is a crucial piece of information that eliminates many possibilities, such as an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) or a propoxy group (-OCH2CH2CH3).\n\n2.  **Assemble the Structural Fragments:**\n    *   **Fragment 1:** A para-substituted benzene ring (**C6H4**).\n    *   **Fragment 2:** A propenyl group (**-C3H5**).\n    *   **Fragment 3:** An ester substituent that contains the second methyl group and has no -CH2- groups. There are two simple possibilities:\n        *   An acetate group attached through oxygen: **-O-CO-CH3** (an acetoxy group).\n        *   A methyl ester group attached through carbon: **-CO-O-CH3** (a methoxycarbonyl group).\n\n3.  **Determine the Molecular Formula by Combining Fragments:**\n    *   **Case A:** The two substituents on the C6H4 ring are the propenyl group and the methoxycarbonyl group.\n        *   Molecule: Methyl propenylbenzoate, CH3-CH=CH-C6H4-COOCH3\n        *   Formula Calculation: C6H4 (ring) + C3H5 (propenyl) + C2H3O2 (methoxycarbonyl) = **C11H12O2**.\n        *   Let's re-calculate that. C6H4 + C3H5 + COOCH3 = C(6+3+1) H(4+5+3) O2 = **C10H12O2**. This formula is not among the choices.\n\n    *   **Case B:** The two substituents on the C6H4 ring are the propenyl group and the acetoxy group.\n        *   Molecule: Propenylphenyl acetate, CH3-CH=CH-C6H4-O-CO-CH3\n        *   Formula Calculation: C6H4 (ring) + C3H5 (propenyl) + C2H3O2 (acetoxy) = C(6+3+2) H(4+5+3) O2 = **C11H12O2**.\n        *   This formula matches option D.\n\n4.  **Verify the chosen structure and formula (C11H12O2):**\n    *   **Formula:** C11H12O2. This is option D.\n    *   **Consistency Check:** The proposed structure, propenylphenyl acetate, has a di-substituted aromatic ring, an ester group, no -CH2- groups, and fits the NMR data perfectly:\n        *   Two aromatic signals (para-substitution).\n        *   Two vinyl signals (doublet and doublet of quartets for the propenyl group).\n        *   Two methyl signals (a doublet from the propenyl group and a singlet from the acetate group).\n        *   Total of 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 signals.\n    *   The structure is fully consistent with all provided spectroscopic data.\n\n5.  **Evaluate Other Formula Options:**\n    *   **C11H14O2 and C12H12O2:** The Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) for these formulas does not match the required structural elements (a benzene ring, a C=C bond, and a C=O bond, requiring DBE=4+1+1=6).\n        *   DBE(C11H14O2) = 11 + 1 - 14/2 = 5. (Incorrect)\n        *   DBE(C12H12O2) = 12 + 1 - 12/2 = 7. (Incorrect)\n    *   **C12H14O2:** The DBE is 6, which is consistent. However, to get this formula from the known fragments (C6H4, C3H5, an ester with a CH3, no CH2), we would need to add CH2. For instance, `p-propenylphenyl propionate`, (CH3CH=CH)-C6H4-O-CO-**CH2**CH3. This structure contains a -CH2- group, which contradicts the given NMR data. It's not possible to construct an isomer of C12H14O2 that fits all the NMR constraints.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only formula that allows for a structure perfectly matching all the spectroscopic data is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning used to identify the chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Structure:** The compound is described as a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means it is a derivative of benzene (C6H6) where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by other groups. The core of this molecule is therefore a C6H4 ring.\n\n2.  **Interpret the FTIR Spectrum:** The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of an ester group (-COO-). This functional group contains two oxygen atoms, so the molecular formula must end in O2. All the given options (C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2) are consistent with this.\n\n3.  **Interpret the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (C6H4-H):** There are two signals for the aromatic protons. A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons. The presence of only two signals implies symmetry, which strongly suggests a **para (1,4) substitution pattern**. In a para-substituted ring, the four protons are chemically equivalent in two pairs, giving rise to two signals.\n    *   **Vinyl Protons (-CH=CH-):** There are two signals for vinyl protons. One is a doublet (d) and the other is a doublet of quartets (dq). This specific splitting pattern is characteristic of a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**.\n        *   The vinyl proton attached to the ring is split only by the other vinyl proton, appearing as a doublet.\n        *   The second vinyl proton is split by the first vinyl proton (a doublet) and the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets.\n        This confirms one substituent is a propenyl group, which has the formula **-C3H5**.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-CH3):** There are two signals for -CH3 groups. One of these methyl groups belongs to the propenyl substituent identified above. The other methyl group must belong to the ester substituent.\n    *   **Absence of -CH2- Protons:** The spectrum shows no signals for methylene (-CH2-) groups. This provides a crucial clue about the structure of the ester. For an ester group not to contain a -CH2- unit, it must be a **methyl ester (-COOCH3)** or an **acetate group attached via the oxygen atom (-O-COCH3)**. In either case, the ester substituent's formula is **-C2H3O2**.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Molecular Formula:**\n    Now, we sum the atoms from all the identified parts of the molecule:\n    *   Benzene ring core: C6H4\n    *   Propenyl substituent: C3H5\n    *   Ester substituent: C2H3O2\n\n    Total atoms:\n    *   Carbon (C): 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n    *   Oxygen (O): 0 + 0 + 2 = 2\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n5.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated formula C11H12O2 matches option C.\n\nThe Python code confirmed this calculation:\n```\nThe chemical formula is C11H12O2\n```\nThis confirms that the deduced structure, Methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate, is consistent with the spectral data and leads to the formula C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\nThe analysis of the spectroscopic data provides a clear path to the correct chemical formula.\n\n**1.  Breaking Down the 1H NMR Data:**\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with two signals for aromatic-H:** This strongly suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern on a benzene ring, most likely para (1,4) substitution. This accounts for the `C6H4` part of the molecule (4 hydrogens).\n*   **Two signals for vinyl-H and one signal for a -CH3 group with characteristic splitting (doublet and doublet of quartets):** This is a classic signature for a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`) attached to the ring. This substituent adds 3 carbons and 5 hydrogens to the count.\n*   **One more signal for a -CH3 group:** The second substituent is an ester (from FTIR). The fact that there are no -CH2- signals means it cannot be an ethyl ester (`-COOCH2CH3`). The simplest option consistent with the data is a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`), which has a methyl group. This substituent adds 2 carbons (one from `C=O`, one from `-CH3`) and 3 hydrogens.\n*   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a critical piece of information that eliminates any possibility of having ethyl or longer alkyl chains as part of the structure.\n\n**2.  Counting the Atoms:**\n\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from benzene ring) + 3 (from propenyl group) + 1 (from ester C=O) + 1 (from ester -CH3) = **11 carbons**.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from aromatic ring) + 5 (from propenyl group) + 3 (from ester -CH3) = **12 hydrogens**.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from the ester group -COO-).\n\nThis count leads to the molecular formula **C11H12O2**.\n\n**3.  Verification with Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n\n*   **DBE from Structure:** 1 benzene ring (4 DBE) + 1 C=C double bond (1 DBE) + 1 C=O double bond (1 DBE) = **6 DBE**.\n*   **DBE from Formula Options:**\n    *   A) C11H14O2: DBE = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 5 (Incorrect)\n    *   B) C11H12O2: DBE = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6 (**Correct**)\n    *   C) C12H14O2: DBE = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 6. While the DBE is correct, this formula has an extra `CH2` group compared to C11H12O2, which is contradicted by the NMR data. (Incorrect)\n    *   D) C12H12O2: DBE = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 (Incorrect)\n\nThe only formula that perfectly matches all the spectroscopic data is C11H12O2. The code execution correctly confirmed this analysis.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 55:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the basic structural information:**\n    *   The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means it is based on a benzene ring with two substituents, with a core formula of C6H4.\n    *   The FTIR spectrum indicates an ester group (-COO-). This accounts for the two oxygen atoms present in all the given formula options.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the 1H NMR data:** The 1H NMR spectrum gives us the most detailed clues about the hydrogen environments in the molecule.\n    *   **Aromatic-H (two signals):** A di-substituted benzene ring can have ortho (1,2-), meta (1,3-), or para (1,4-) substitution.\n        *   For different substituents, ortho and meta patterns would typically result in four distinct signals for the four aromatic protons.\n        *   A para (1,4-) substitution pattern, due to its symmetry, results in only two distinct types of aromatic protons. Each signal would represent two equivalent protons, typically appearing as a doublet. Therefore, the \"two signals\" strongly suggest a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. These four protons (4H) are part of the C6H4 core.\n\n    *   **–CH2 groups (no signals):** The problem explicitly states there are no signals for –CH2– groups. This is a crucial piece of information. The ester group could be a methyl ester (-COOCH3), an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3), a propyl ester (-COOCH2CH2CH3), etc. The absence of a –CH2– signal rules out ethyl and propyl esters, leaving **methyl ester (-COOCH3)** as the most likely candidate. This fragment accounts for one of the two methyl signals.\n\n    *   **Vinyl-H (two signals: one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** Vinyl protons are hydrogens attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (-CH=CH-). The specific splitting pattern provided is very informative.\n        *   A \"doublet of quartets\" (dq) means a proton is coupled to one adjacent proton (giving the doublet) and to a group of three equivalent protons (giving the quartet).\n        *   A \"doublet\" (d) means a proton is coupled to only one adjacent proton.\n        *   This pattern is characteristic of a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**. Let's label the protons: -CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3.\n            *   Proton H(a) is coupled to H(b), so its signal is a **doublet**.\n            *   Proton H(b) is coupled to H(a) (a doublet) and also to the three protons of the CH3 group (a quartet). Therefore, its signal is a **doublet of quartets**.\n        *   This matches the data perfectly. This propenyl group fragment has the formula -C3H5.\n\n    *   **–CH3 groups (two signals):** We have accounted for both methyl groups now.\n        *   One is the methyl group of the methyl ester (-COOCH3). This would be a singlet signal as it has no adjacent protons.\n        *   The other is the methyl group of the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3). This signal would be a doublet, as it is coupled to the adjacent vinyl proton, H(b).\n\n3.  **Assemble the structure and determine the formula:** Based on the analysis above, the unknown compound is composed of:\n    *   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring core: C6H4\n    *   Substituent 1: A methyl ester group, -COOCH3 (Formula fragment: C2O2H3)\n    *   Substituent 2: A propenyl group, -CH=CH-CH3 (Formula fragment: C3H5)\n\n    The full structure is **methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the total chemical formula:**\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from ring) + 2 (from ester) + 3 (from propenyl) = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from ring) + 3 (from ester) + 5 (from propenyl) = **12**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from ester) = **2**\n\n    The final chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n5.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    A) C11H12O2\n    B) C12H14O2\n    C) C11H14O2\n    D) C12H12O2\n\n    The calculated formula C11H12O2 matches option A. We can also confirm that the other options are incorrect. For instance, C12H14O2 would likely be ethyl 4-propylbenzoate or a similar isomer, which would either lack vinyl protons or contain a -CH2- group, both contradicting the data.\n\nTherefore, the chemical formula of the unknown compound is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\nThe user wants me to identify the correct chemical formula from a list of options based on spectroscopic data.\n\n**My reasoning process:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the clues from the problem statement.**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells me the core of the molecule is a benzene ring (C6) with two substituents. The aromatic part of the formula will be C6H4. The ring itself accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (DBE: 1 for the ring and 3 for the double bonds).\n    *   **\"FTIR ... shows an ester group\"**: An ester group is -COO-. This adds a C=O double bond, which is one more degree of unsaturation. It also adds two oxygen atoms to the formula.\n    *   **\"1H NMR spectrum shows six signals\"**: This describes the different proton environments in the molecule.\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\"**: A di-substituted benzene ring with 4 protons that give only two signals strongly suggests a *para* (1,4) substitution pattern due to its symmetry.\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\"**: Vinyl protons are hydrogens attached to a C=C double bond. This splitting pattern (d, dq) is classic for a **propenyl group**, specifically `R-CH=CH-CH3`.\n        *   The H on the carbon next to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl-H (making it a doublet) and by the three methyl protons (making each peak of the doublet a quartet). Hence, a doublet of quartets.\n        *   The other vinyl H is only split by the adjacent vinyl H, so it appears as a doublet.\n        *   This propenyl group `(-CH=CH-CH3)` adds 1 C=C double bond (1 DBE), 3 carbons, and 5 hydrogens. It also accounts for one of the two `-CH3` signals.\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups\"**: We've already accounted for one `–CH3` group in the propenyl substituent. The second `–CH3` group must be part of the ester.\n    *   **\"no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups\"**: This is a crucial constraint. An ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) would have a -CH2- group, so that's not possible. The ester must be either a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate (-OOCCH3) to satisfy the \"no -CH2-\" and \"two -CH3\" rules. Both of these fragments add a `–CH3` group without a `–CH2` group.\n\n2.  **Assemble the pieces to determine the molecular formula.**\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** C6H4\n    *   **Substituent 1 (Propenyl):** -CH=CH-CH3 -> C3H5\n    *   **Substituent 2 (Ester with a Methyl):** -COOCH3 (methyl ester) or -OOCCH3 (acetate). In both cases, this piece contributes C2H3O2 to the total formula.\n    *   **Total Formula Calculation:**\n        *   Carbon (C): 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n        *   Hydrogen (H): 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n        *   Oxygen (O): **2**\n    *   The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n3.  **Verify the result using the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE).**\n    *   The general formula for DBE is `C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *   DBE for our deduced formula C11H12O2: `11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6`.\n    *   Let's check if this matches our structural analysis:\n        *   Benzene ring = 4 DBE\n        *   C=C in the propenyl group = 1 DBE\n        *   C=O in the ester group = 1 DBE\n        *   Total expected DBE = 4 + 1 + 1 = **6**.\n    *   The DBE matches perfectly.\n\n4.  **Compare with the given options.**\n    *   A) C12H12O2\n    *   B) C12H14O2\n    *   C) **C11H12O2**\n    *   D) C11H14O2\n    *   Our deduced formula, C11H12O2, matches option C.\n\nThe Python code was used to confirm the DBE calculation for all options, reinforcing the conclusion that C11H12O2 has the correct number of rings and pi bonds to match the structural fragments identified from the NMR and IR data.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\nThe user has not asked a new question. The previous interaction involved solving a problem to identify the chemical formula of a compound based on its spectral data. The provided \"Code output\" and \"Errors\" fields are empty, but they refer to the code that was run in the previous step.\n\nThe previous reasoning process was as follows:\n1.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) Calculation:**\n    *   The structure contains a benzene ring (DoU=4), a C=O bond (DoU=1), and a C=C bond (DoU=1). Total required DoU = 6.\n    *   The DoU for the options were calculated:\n        *   C12H14O2: DoU = 6\n        *   C11H14O2: DoU = 5\n        *   C11H12O2: DoU = 6\n        *   C12H12O2: DoU = 7\n    *   This eliminated options B and D, leaving A and C as possibilities.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectral Analysis:**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Two signals for aromatic protons on a di-substituted ring imply a para (1,4) substitution pattern (`C6H4` fragment).\n    *   **Vinyl:** A doublet and a doublet of quartets indicate a `–CH=CH–CH3` (propenyl) group. This fragment is `C3H5`.\n    *   **Alkyl:** Two –CH3 signals and no –CH2 signals. One –CH3 is from the propenyl group. The other must be part of the ester, suggesting a methyl ester (`–COOCH3`) or an acetate (`–OCOCH3`). The methyl ester fragment is `C2O2H3`.\n\n3.  **Structure Assembly and Formula Determination:**\n    *   Assembling the most likely fragments: `C6H4` (ring) + `C3H5` (propenyl group) + `C2H3O2` (methyl ester group).\n    *   Summing the atoms:\n        *   Carbon: 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n        *   Hydrogen: 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n        *   Oxygen: 2\n    *   This leads to the formula `C11H12O2`.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   The derived formula `C11H12O2` matches option C and has the correct DoU of 6.\n    *   Option A, `C12H14O2`, differs by a `CH2` group. Since the NMR spectrum explicitly shows no `–CH2` signals, this option is incorrect.\n    *   Therefore, the only formula consistent with all the data is `C11H12O2`.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\nHere is my reasoning and thinking process to identify the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the given information:**\n    *   **Structure type:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This strongly implies a benzene ring with two substituents (C6H4). The \"di-substituted\" nature means there are 4 protons on the aromatic ring.\n    *   **FTIR Data:** An absorption peak for an ester group (-COO-). This tells us the molecule contains at least one C=O bond and an ether-like linkage. An ester group contributes C and O2 to the formula.\n    *   **1H NMR Data:** There are a total of six signals. Let's break them down:\n        *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A benzene ring with two substituents has 4 aromatic protons. Having only two signals for these 4 protons suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely a para- (1,4) substitution, which makes the protons chemically equivalent in two pairs.\n        *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** Vinyl hydrogens are protons attached to a C=C double bond. This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) attached to a group that does not cause further major splitting (like an aromatic ring).\n            *   Let's label the protons: Ring-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3.\n            *   The signal for H(a) is split by H(b) into a **doublet**.\n            *   The signal for H(b) is split by H(a) into a doublet, and this doublet is further split by the three protons of the adjacent -CH3 group into a quartet. The resulting signal is a **doublet of quartets**.\n            *   This confirms the presence of a -CH=CH-CH3 fragment.\n        *   **Two signals for -CH3 groups:** There are two chemically different methyl groups in the molecule. One is from the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3). The other must be part of the second substituent.\n        *   **No signals for -CH2 groups:** This is a crucial piece of information that eliminates many possible structures.\n\n2.  **Assemble the molecular fragments:**\n    *   We have a para-substituted benzene ring (C6H4).\n    *   One substituent is a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3). Its formula is C3H5.\n    *   The other substituent must contain the ester group (-COO-) and the second methyl group (-CH3). To form a stable substituent containing these pieces without a -CH2- group, there are two common possibilities:\n        *   **Possibility A:** The substituent is a methyl ester group, -COOCH3. The benzene ring is attached to the carbonyl carbon.\n        *   **Possibility B:** The substituent is an acetoxy group, -O-CO-CH3. The benzene ring is attached to the oxygen atom.\n\n3.  **Construct the full structure and determine the molecular formula:**\n\n    *   **Based on Possibility A:** The molecule is methyl 4-(1-propenyl)benzoate.\n        *   Structure: CH3-CH=CH-C6H4-COOCH3\n        *   Let's count the atoms:\n            *   Carbon (C): 6 (from the ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from methyl ester) = 11\n            *   Hydrogen (H): 4 (from the ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from methyl ester) = 12\n            *   Oxygen (O): 2 (from the ester)\n        *   The molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n    *   **Based on Possibility B:** The molecule is 4-(1-propenyl)phenyl acetate.\n        *   Structure: CH3-CH=CH-C6H4-O-CO-CH3\n        *   Let's count the atoms:\n            *   Carbon (C): 6 (from the ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from acetate) = 11\n            *   Hydrogen (H): 4 (from the ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from acetate) = 12\n            *   Oxygen (O): 2 (from the ester)\n        *   The molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n    Both plausible structures that fit all the spectroscopic data lead to the same molecular formula: C11H12O2.\n\n4.  **Verify the result by checking the other options:**\n\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) Calculation:** DoU = C + 1 - H/2.\n    *   **For C11H12O2:** DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6. This is consistent with a benzene ring (DoU=4), one C=C bond (DoU=1), and one C=O bond (DoU=1). (4+1+1 = 6). This fits our proposed structure perfectly.\n    *   **For C11H14O2:** DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 5. This DoU implies there is no C=C bond if a benzene ring and an ester group are present, which contradicts the NMR data showing vinyl protons. So, this option is incorrect.\n    *   **For C12H12O2:** DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7. This DoU would require an additional ring or double bond compared to the features identified from the spectra. It's not possible to create a structure with this formula that matches all the NMR data. So, this option is incorrect.\n    *   **For C12H14O2:** DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 6. The DoU is consistent. However, if we try to build a molecule with this formula using the fragments identified (-CH=CH-CH3, C6H4, -COO-, a second -CH3), we find that a -CH2- group must be present, which contradicts the \"no –CH2 groups\" information from the NMR. So, this option is also incorrect.\n\nBased on the thorough analysis of the provided spectral data, the only possible chemical formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 59:\nHere's my thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Provided Information:**\n    *   **Core Structure:** \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This means we have a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two substituents.\n    *   **Functional Group:** \"FTIR spectrum... shows... an ester group\". This tells us the molecule contains a -COO- functional group. An ester has the general formula R-COO-R'.\n    *   **Proton NMR (¹H NMR) Data:** This is the most detailed piece of information.\n        *   **Total Signals:** Six signals.\n        *   **Aromatic Protons:** \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\". A di-substituted benzene ring (C₆H₄) has 4 protons. Having only two signals for these 4 protons strongly suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, specifically para (1,4) substitution, where the two substituents are different. This gives an AA'BB' system, which often appears as two distinct signals (doublets).\n        *   **Vinyl Protons:** \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\". Vinyl protons are hydrogens attached to a C=C double bond. This splitting pattern (doublet and doublet of quartets) is a classic signature for a `-CH=CH-CH₃` group.\n            *   Let's label the group: Ar-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH₃(c).\n            *   H(b) is split by H(a) into a doublet, and then by the three H(c) protons into a quartet. This results in a doublet of quartets (dq).\n            *   H(a) is only split by H(b) into a doublet (d). This perfectly matches the description.\n        *   **Methyl Protons:** \"two signals corresponding to –CH₃ groups\".\n            *   One methyl group is the one from our proposed `-CH=CH-CH₃` (propenyl) group. Its protons (H(c)) are adjacent to one vinyl proton (H(b)), so they would appear as a doublet.\n            *   The second methyl group must be part of the ester, as there are no other places for it.\n        *   **Absence of Signals:** \"There are no signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups\". This is a crucial negative constraint, ruling out many possibilities like ethyl esters (`-COOCH₂CH₃`) or longer alkyl chains.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Molecular Structure:**\n    *   We have a C₆H₄ ring.\n    *   We have a `-CH=CH-CH₃` group (propenyl group) as one substituent. This accounts for the vinyl signals and one of the methyl signals. Its formula is C₃H₅.\n    *   We have an ester group and the second methyl group. The \"no -CH₂-\" rule means the methyl must be directly attached to the ester functionality. This leaves two possibilities for how the ester is attached to the ring:\n        *   **Possibility A:** Methyl benzoate derivative. The ring is attached to the carbonyl carbon. The substituent is `-COOCH₃` (methyl ester). The methyl protons here would be a singlet, as they have no adjacent protons.\n        *   **Possibility B:** Phenyl acetate derivative. The ring is attached to the ester oxygen. The substituent is `-O-CO-CH₃` (acetoxy group). The methyl protons here would also be a singlet.\n    *   Both possibilities fit the NMR data:\n        *   2 aromatic signals (from the para-C₆H₄ ring).\n        *   2 vinyl signals (d and dq from the propenyl group).\n        *   2 methyl signals (one doublet from the propenyl group, one singlet from the ester methyl).\n        *   Total of 6 signals.\n        *   No -CH₂ groups.\n\n3.  **Determine the Chemical Formula:**\n    Now, let's calculate the molecular formula for the structure we've deduced. It doesn't matter which ester linkage (Possibility A or B) we use, as the total atoms will be the same. Let's build the formula from the pieces:\n    *   Benzene ring part: `C₆H₄`\n    *   Propenyl substituent: `C₃H₅`\n    *   Ester-methyl part: This consists of the remaining atoms: one methyl group (`CH₃`) and the ester atoms (`COO`). Total for this part: `C₂H₃O₂`.\n    *   Let's add them up:\n        *   Carbons (C): 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n        *   Hydrogens (H): 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n        *   Oxygens (O): 2\n    *   The resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n4.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) and Eliminate Other Options:**\n    The DBE (also called double bond equivalent) tells us the total number of rings and pi bonds.\n    *   DBE = C + 1 - (H/2)\n    *   **Expected DBE from structure:** A benzene ring has 4 DBE (1 ring + 3 π bonds). The vinyl C=C has 1 DBE. The ester C=O has 1 DBE. Total expected DBE = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n    *   **DBE of C₁₁H₁₂O₂:** 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6. This matches perfectly.\n    *   **Check the other options:**\n        *   `C₁₁H₁₄O₂`: DBE = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 12 - 7 = 5. This DBE is too low. It cannot have a benzene ring, a C=C bond, and a C=O bond simultaneously.\n        *   `C₁₂H₁₂O₂`: DBE = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 13 - 6 = 7. This DBE is too high. It would require an additional ring or π bond not accounted for by the spectral data.\n        *   `C₁₂H₁₄O₂`: DBE = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 13 - 7 = 6. While the DBE matches, this formula has a `CH₂` group more than `C₁₁H₁₂O₂`. The problem explicitly states there are **no -CH₂ groups**, so this formula is incorrect.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The only formula that is fully consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data (aromatic ring, ester, specific vinyl and methyl signals, and no CH₂ groups) and the rules of chemical structures (DBE) is C₁₁H₁₂O₂. The compound is likely methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate or 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)phenyl acetate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 60:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the 1H NMR data to determine the number of hydrogen atoms.**\n    *   **Aromatic Hydrogens:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. A benzene ring (C6H6) that is di-substituted has four remaining hydrogens on the ring (C6H4). The fact that there are \"two signals\" for these hydrogens suggests a symmetric substitution pattern, like 1,4- (para) substitution, where the four protons are chemically non-equivalent in two sets of two, giving two signals. Thus, we have 4 aromatic hydrogens.\n    *   **Vinyl Hydrogens:** There are \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H\". This means there are 2 vinyl hydrogens in the molecule. The splitting pattern (one doublet, one doublet of quartets) is a classic signature for a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) attached to a group without protons.\n    *   **Methyl Hydrogens:** There are \"two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups\". This means there are two distinct methyl groups. Each methyl group has 3 hydrogens, so the total number of methyl hydrogens is 2 * 3 = 6.\n    *   **Total Hydrogen Count:** We can sum the hydrogens from all parts of the molecule: 4 (aromatic) + 2 (vinyl) + 6 (methyl) = 12 hydrogens.\n    *   Based on the hydrogen count, the molecular formula must have H12. This eliminates options B (C11H14O2) and D (C12H14O2). The correct formula must be either A (C11H12O2) or C (C12H12O2).\n\n2.  **Analyze the functional groups and carbon skeleton to determine the number of carbon atoms.**\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** The 6-membered aromatic ring contributes 6 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Ester Group:** The FTIR spectrum indicates an ester group (-COO-). The carbonyl carbon (C=O) of the ester contributes 1 carbon atom.\n    *   **Vinyl Group:** The two vinyl hydrogens must be attached to two separate carbon atoms in a double bond (-CH=CH-). This contributes 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Methyl Groups:** The two methyl groups (-CH3) contribute 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Total Carbon Count:** Summing the carbons from these identified fragments gives a minimum number of carbons: 6 (ring) + 1 (ester carbonyl) + 2 (vinyl) + 2 (methyl) = 11 carbon atoms.\n\n3.  **Determine the number of oxygen atoms.**\n    *   The ester functional group (-COO-) contains 2 oxygen atoms.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Molecular Formula and conclude.**\n    *   Based on the analysis, the molecule contains 11 carbons, 12 hydrogens, and 2 oxygens.\n    *   The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n    *   This formula is fully consistent with the data. For example, a plausible structure is `methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate` or `p-tolyl crotonate`. Both have the formula C11H12O2 and fit all the spectral data described (di-substituted aromatic ring, ester, two vinyl protons with d/dq splitting, two distinct methyl groups, and no CH2 groups).\n    *   The formula C12H12O2 would require an additional carbon atom with no attached protons (a quaternary carbon), as the hydrogen count is fixed at 12. Inserting such a carbon into a plausible structure while remaining consistent with all the NMR data (especially the splitting patterns) is not feasible. For example, altering the propenyl group to include a quaternary carbon would change the number of vinyl protons or their splitting patterns.\n\nTherefore, the only logical choice is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>."
