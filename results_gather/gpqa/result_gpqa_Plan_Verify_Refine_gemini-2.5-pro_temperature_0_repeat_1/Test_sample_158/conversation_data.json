    "The problem asks for the comoving distance to a quasar. The key information is a spectral peak at 790 nm, with a significant flux drop at shorter wavelengths. This feature is characteristic of the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) emission line from a high-redshift object. The flux drop is caused by the Lyman-alpha forest and the Gunn-Peterson trough, where neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium absorbs photons with wavelengths shorter than the redshifted Lyα line.\n\n1.  **Determine the Redshift (z):**\n    *   The rest-frame wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line (Lyα) is λ_rest ≈ 121.6 nm.\n    *   The observed wavelength is λ_obs = 790 nm.\n    *   The redshift `z` is calculated using the formula: `z = (λ_obs / λ_rest) - 1`.\n    *   `z = (790 / 121.6) - 1 ≈ 6.50 - 1 = 5.5`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Comoving Distance:**\n    *   Using the provided cosmological parameters (H₀ = 70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹, Ω_m = 0.3, Ω_Λ = 0.7) for a flat Lambda-CDM universe, we can calculate the comoving distance.\n    *   The formula for comoving distance (D_c) involves integrating over redshift:\n        D_c = (c / H₀) * ∫[from 0 to z] dz' / sqrt(Ω_m(1+z')³ + Ω_Λ(1+z')⁰)\n    *   Plugging in the values and performing the numerical integration for z ≈ 5.5 gives a comoving distance.\n    *   The calculation performed in the code yielded a redshift `z = 5.50` and a corresponding comoving distance of **8.02 Gpc**.\n\n3.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   The calculated distance of 8.02 Gpc is extremely close to option B.\n    *   A) 6 Gpc\n    *   B) 8 Gpc\n    *   C) 7 Gpc\n    *   D) 9 Gpc\n\nThe calculated value of 8.02 Gpc matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
