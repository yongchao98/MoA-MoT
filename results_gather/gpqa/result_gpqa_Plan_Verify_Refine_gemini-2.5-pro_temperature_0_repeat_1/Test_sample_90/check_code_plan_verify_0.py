    # --- Step 1: Aldol Reaction Analysis ---
    # Principle 1: The reaction of the kinetic lithium enolate of cyclohexanone with benzaldehyde
    #              favors the 'anti' diastereomer as the major product.
    # Let's represent the stereocenters of one enantiomer of the 'anti' product.
    # Product 1 is a beta-hydroxy ketone: (2R)-2-((R)-hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one.
    # The other enantiomer would be (2S, benzylic S). The relative 'anti' configuration is key.
    product_1_stereocenters = {'ring_C2': 'R', 'benzylic_C': 'R'}

    # --- Step 2: Fluorination Reaction Analysis ---
    # Principle 2: Excess DAST converts a ketone (C=O) to a geminal difluoride (CF2).
    #              This reaction does not affect the stereocenter at C2.
    # Principle 3: DAST converts a secondary alcohol (-OH) to a fluoride (-F) with inversion of configuration.

    # Applying these principles to Product 1 to predict Product 2:
    # The stereocenter at C2 of the ring is unaffected by the fluorination of the ketone at C1.
    predicted_product_2_ring_stereocenter = product_1_stereocenters['ring_C2']  # Stays 'R'

    # The alcohol at the benzylic carbon is converted to a fluoride with inversion of configuration.

    # The chosen answer is A) ((S)-((R)-2,2-difluorocyclohexyl)fluoromethyl)benzene
    # We need to extract the stereochemical descriptors from this name.
    # The format is ((benzylic_stereo)-((ring_stereo)-...)...)
    # The outer descriptor (S) refers to the benzylic carbon ("fluoromethyl" part).
    # The inner descriptor (R) refers to the stereocenter on the cyclohexyl ring.
