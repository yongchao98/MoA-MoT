    Checks the correctness of the answer for the Cope rearrangement question.

    # A Cope rearrangement is an isomerization. The product must have the same molecular formula (C8H11N) and DoU (4).
    # The [3,3] aza-Cope rearrangement of a C=C-N-C-C=C system is expected to yield a product containing
    # a C=N (imine) and a C=C (alkene) bond.
    
    # 3. Evaluate the proposed answer (Option D)
    # The LLM identifies the product as 4,4a,5,6-tetrahydro-1H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine based on literature.
    # This product is a fused 6,5 bicyclic system.
    # A bicyclic system (contributes 2 to DoU) with one imine (1 pi bond, +1 to DoU) and one alkene (1 pi bond, +1 to DoU)
    # would have a total DoU = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.
    
    # This is consistent with the starting material's DoU.
    # The provided answer is therefore chemically sound and consistent with published experimental results for this reaction.
    # The LLM correctly identified the starting material, correctly stated the nature of the reaction, and correctly
    # identified the literature product. The choice of option D is based on matching the name from the literature.
