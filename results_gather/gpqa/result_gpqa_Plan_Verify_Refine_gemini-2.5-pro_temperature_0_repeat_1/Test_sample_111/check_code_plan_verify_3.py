    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer to the quantum mechanics problem.
    
    The problem involves:
    1. A state |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>.
    2. An operator A with matrix elements Aij = hbar/2 for i!=j and 0 otherwise.
    3. Calculating the probabilities of measuring the system in the eigenstates of A.
    4. Calculating the average value of A.

    The function will:
    - Normalize the state |alpha>.
    - Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of operator A.
    - Calculate the measurement probabilities.
    - Calculate the expectation value of A.
    - Compare these calculated values with the values from the proposed answer (Option B).
