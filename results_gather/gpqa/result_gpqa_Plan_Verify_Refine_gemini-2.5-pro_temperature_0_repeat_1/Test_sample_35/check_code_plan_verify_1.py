    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer to the astronomy question.

    The function verifies the following steps:
    1. Calculates the redshift 'z' from the given distance using Hubble's Law.
    2. Calculates the rest-frame energy of the absorption line.
    3. Compares the calculated rest-frame energy to the known energy of the 21 cm neutral hydrogen line.
    4. Confirms that the 21 cm line is a tracer for the "Cold atomic interstellar medium", which corresponds to option C.
