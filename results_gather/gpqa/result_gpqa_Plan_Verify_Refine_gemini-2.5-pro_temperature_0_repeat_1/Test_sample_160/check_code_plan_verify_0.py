    """
    Checks the correctness of the LLM's answer by verifying its logical derivation.

    The check is based on the following physical principles:
    1. Mean Free Path (MFP) of gas-gas collisions: λ1 = 1 / (sqrt(2) * n * σ_gg)
    2. MFP of electron-gas collisions: λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)
    3. The gas-gas collision cross-section (σ_gg) is larger than the electron-gas
       scattering cross-section (σ_eg) for high-energy electrons. So, σ_gg > σ_eg.
