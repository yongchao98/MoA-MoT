    Checks the correctness of the reasoning provided for the physics problem.

    The function verifies the logical steps:
    1. It uses the formulas for the two mean free paths (MFPs).
    2. It applies the key physical principle that the gas-gas collision cross-section (sigma_gg)
       is larger than the electron-gas scattering cross-section (sigma_eg).
    3. It derives the relationship between λ2 and λ1.
    4. It evaluates the given multiple-choice options against the derived relationship.

    # --- Step 1: Define the core physical principle ---
    # The reasoning correctly states that the cross-section for gas-gas collisions (sigma_gg)
    # is significantly larger than for electron-gas collisions (sigma_eg).
    # Let's represent their ratio as sigma_ratio = sigma_gg / sigma_eg.
    # The core principle is that sigma_ratio > 1.
    # We can test the logic by assuming this principle is true.
    # For the sake of demonstration, let's use a plausible value, e.g., sigma_ratio = 10,
    # but the logic only depends on it being > 1.
    sigma_ratio_is_greater_than_1 = True

    # --- Step 2: Follow the derivation from the reasoning ---
    # The ratio of the MFPs is derived as:
    # λ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)]
    # λ2 / λ1 = (√2 * n * σ_gg) / (n * σ_eg)
    # λ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)
    # λ2 / λ1 = √2 * sigma_ratio
    
    # --- Step 3: Determine the consequence for the MFP ratio ---
    # Since sigma_ratio > 1, it must be true that:
    # λ2 / λ1 > √2 * 1
    # λ2 / λ1 > √2
    
    sqrt_2 = math.sqrt(2)
    # So, the derived lower bound for the ratio λ2/λ1 is ~1.414.
    
    # --- Step 4: Evaluate the options against the derived conclusion ---
    # We must check which option is consistent with the fact that (λ2 / λ1) > 1.414.
    
    # Option A: λ2 >= 1.22 * λ1  =>  (λ2 / λ1) >= 1.22
    # Is a number > 1.414 also >= 1.22? Yes. This option is consistent.

    # Option B: λ2 = λ1  =>  (λ2 / λ1) = 1
    # Is a number > 1.414 also = 1? No. This option is inconsistent.
