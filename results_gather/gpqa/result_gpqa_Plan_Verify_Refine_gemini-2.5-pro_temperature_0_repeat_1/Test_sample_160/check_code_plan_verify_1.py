    This function checks the correctness of the reasoning for the relationship

    The check is based on the physical principles and formulas for mean free path,
    not on specific numerical values which are not provided.
    """

    # --- Step 1: Define the core physical principle ---
    # The mean free path (λ) is inversely proportional to the collision cross-section (σ).
    # λ ∝ 1/σ

    # --- Step 2: Define the two scenarios and their cross-sections ---
    # Scenario 1: Gas molecules colliding with each other.
    # The cross-section is the gas-kinetic cross-section, σ_gg.
    # This is related to the physical size of the molecule, typically modeled as π*d^2 where d is the molecular diameter.
    # The mean free path is λ1 = 1 / (sqrt(2) * n * σ_gg), where n is the number density.

    # Scenario 2: High-energy electrons colliding with gas molecules.
    # The cross-section is the electron-gas scattering cross-section, σ_eg.
    # A high-energy electron is a point-like particle. It interacts with the much smaller
    # components of the atom (nucleus and orbital electrons), not the entire molecular diameter.
    # The mean free path is λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg).

    # --- Step 3: Establish the relationship between cross-sections ---
    # Based on physical principles, the target area presented by a gas molecule to another
    # gas molecule (σ_gg) is significantly larger than the target area it presents to a
    # high-energy electron (σ_eg).
    # Therefore, the fundamental assumption is: σ_gg > σ_eg.
    # This implies the ratio (σ_gg / σ_eg) > 1.

    # --- Step 4: Derive the relationship between λ1 and λ2 ---
    # Let's find the ratio λ2 / λ1:
    # λ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (sqrt(2) * n * σ_gg)]
    # By simplifying the fraction:
    # λ2 / λ1 = (sqrt(2) * n * σ_gg) / (n * σ_eg)
    # λ2 / λ1 = sqrt(2) * (σ_gg / σ_eg)

    # --- Step 5: Evaluate the derived relationship against the options ---
    sqrt_2 = math.sqrt(2)  # Approximately 1.414

    # Since we established that (σ_gg / σ_eg) > 1, it follows that:
    # λ2 / λ1 > sqrt(2) * 1
    # λ2 / λ1 > 1.414
    # This means λ2 > 1.414 * λ1.

    # Now, let's check the given options:
    # A) λ2 >= 1.22 * λ1
    # Our derived condition is λ2 > 1.414 * λ1. Any value satisfying this condition
    # also satisfies λ2 >= 1.22 * λ1. This option is consistent and correct.

    # B) λ2 = λ1
    # This implies λ2 / λ1 = 1. Our derivation shows the ratio must be > 1.414. Incorrect.

    # C) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22 * λ1
    # This implies 1 < λ2 / λ1 < 1.22. Our derivation shows the ratio must be > 1.414. Incorrect.

    # D) λ2 < λ1
    # This implies λ2 / λ1 < 1. Our derivation shows the ratio must be > 1.414. Incorrect.

    # The logical derivation presented in the answer is sound. It correctly identifies that
    # the electron-gas cross-section is smaller than the gas-gas cross-section, leading to
    # a longer mean free path for the electrons (λ2). The mathematical derivation
    # correctly shows that λ2 > sqrt(2) * λ1, which makes option A the only valid choice.

    return "Correct"
