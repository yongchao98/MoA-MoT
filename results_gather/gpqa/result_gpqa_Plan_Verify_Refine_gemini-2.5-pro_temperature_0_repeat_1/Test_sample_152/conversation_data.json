    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Analyze Reaction A:** Identify the Michael donor and acceptor. Determine the structure of the product (A) formed after the nucleophilic attack and protonation. Name the product and compare it with the options.\n2.  **Analyze Reaction B:** Identify the enamine (Michael donor) and the α,β-unsaturated nitrile (Michael acceptor). Determine the structure of the product (B) after the Michael addition and subsequent hydrolysis of the enamine. Name the product and compare it with the options.\n3.  **Analyze Reaction C:** This is a retrosynthesis problem. Identify the bond formed during the Michael addition in the given product. Use the structure of the Michael acceptor (but-3-en-2-one) to deduce the structure of the Michael donor (C). Compare the result with the options.\n4.  **Final Conclusion:** Combine the identified structures for A, B, and C to select the correct multiple-choice option.\n\n**Step 1: Determine Product A**\n*   **Michael Donor:** Dimethyl malonate. The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), deprotonates the α-carbon to form a resonance-stabilized enolate: `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which is an α,β-unsaturated ester: `p-tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`.\n*   **Reaction:** The malonate enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate. After protonation by the ethanol solvent, the final product is formed.\n*   **Product A Structure:** `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂)-CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n*   **Naming Product A:** To name this according to the options, we identify the main propane chain. The structure can be seen as: `(CH₃OOC)₂CH(1)-CH(2)(p-tolyl)-CH₂(3)-COOCH₃`. This is a propane chain with carboxylate groups at positions 1, 1, and 3, and a p-tolyl group at position 2. The IUPAC name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n*   This result for A eliminates options A and B.\n\n**Step 2: Determine Product B**\n*   **Michael Donor:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine derived from cyclohexanone and acts as a nucleophile at the α-carbon (C2 of the cyclohexene ring). This is a Stork enamine synthesis, a variant of the Michael reaction.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), an α,β-unsaturated nitrile: `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`.\n*   **Reaction:** The enamine attacks the β-carbon of the nitrile. The resulting iminium ion intermediate is then hydrolyzed by aqueous acid (H₃O⁺), which converts the enamine back into a ketone.\n*   **Product B Structure:** The reaction forms a new bond between C2 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the nitrile. The product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the α-position (C2) with a `–CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` group.\n*   **Naming Product B:** The principal functional group is the nitrile, so the parent chain is butanenitrile. The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent. Numbering from the nitrile group: `N≡C(1)-C₂(H₂)-C₃(H)-C₄(H₃)`. The substituent, (2-oxocyclohexyl), is at position 3. The name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n*   This result for B is consistent with options C and D.\n\n**Step 3: Determine Reactant C**\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition where we need to find one of the reactants (the Michael donor C).\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK): `CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`.\n*   **Retrosynthesis:** The Michael reaction forms a bond between the α-carbon of the donor and the β-carbon of the acceptor. The fragment from MVK in the product is `-CH₂(β)-CH₂(α)-CO-CH₃`, which is the (3-oxobutyl) group. This group is attached to C2 of the cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring. This means C2 was the nucleophilic carbon. For C2 to be nucleophilic, it must have been deprotonated by the base (KOH). The most acidic protons in the donor are on the carbon between two carbonyl groups.\n*   **Reactant C Structure:** The Michael donor (C) must be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**. The base deprotonates the C2 position to form the nucleophilic enolate, which then attacks MVK.\n*   This result for C matches option C.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the analysis:\n*   **A** is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n*   **B** is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.\n*   **C** is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\nThis combination corresponds exactly to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
