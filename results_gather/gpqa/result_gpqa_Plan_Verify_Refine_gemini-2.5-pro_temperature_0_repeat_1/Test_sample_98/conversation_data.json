    "*   **Plan:**\n    1.  Interpret the FTIR data to identify the primary functional group.\n    2.  Analyze the 1H NMR splitting patterns described (doublet of triplets of quartets and doublet of triplets of triplets).\n    3.  Systematically evaluate the structure of each candidate molecule to predict its expected 1H NMR splitting patterns for the methine (CH) protons.\n    4.  Identify the molecule whose predicted spectrum matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **Action:**\n    The first step is to interpret the spectroscopic data.\n    *   **FTIR:** A very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretch in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid. A strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a carboxylic acid. This confirms the compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so this information is consistent with all choices.\n    *   **1H NMR:** The absence of vinyl-hydrogen signals confirms the molecule is saturated, which is also true for all four options. The key information lies in the complex splitting patterns:\n        *   **Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This indicates a proton (let's call it Hx) is coupled to three different groups of neighboring protons: one proton (giving the doublet), a group of two protons (giving the triplet), and a group of three protons (giving the quartet). So, Hx must be a CH group adjacent to another CH, a CH₂, and a CH₃ group.\n        *   **Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This indicates a proton (let's call it Hy) is coupled to three different groups of neighboring protons: one proton (giving the doublet), a group of two protons (giving the first triplet), and another group of two protons (giving the second triplet). So, Hy must be a CH group adjacent to another CH and two different CH₂ groups.\n\n    Now, I will analyze the structure of each candidate to see if it would produce these signals.\n\n*   **Refined Plan:**\n    1.  Analyze the structure of candidate C, as it appears promising.\n    2.  Predict the splitting patterns for its key protons (H at C3 and C4).\n    3.  If it matches, briefly verify that the other candidates do not match to confirm the answer.\n\n*   **Action:**\n    Let's analyze **Candidate C: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH**, which is **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**.\n\n    Structure:\n    ```\n          (C2H5)      (C2H5)\n          |           |\n       CH3--CH(f)--CH(g)--CH2--COOH\n       (5)  (4)     (3)    (2)   (1)\n    ```\n\n    *   **Analysis of proton H(f) at position C4:**\n        *   It is a single proton (a methine, CH).\n        *   Its neighbors are: H(g) at C3 (1 proton), the CH₂ of the ethyl group at C4 (2 protons), and the terminal CH₃ group at C5 (3 protons).\n        *   The predicted splitting pattern is: doublet (from H(g)), triplet (from the ethyl CH₂), and quartet (from the terminal CH₃). This gives a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches one of the signals.\n\n    *   **Analysis of proton H(g) at position C3:**\n        *   It is a single proton (a methine, CH).\n        *   Its neighbors are: H(f) at C4 (1 proton), the CH₂ group at C2 (2 protons), and the CH₂ of the ethyl group at C3 (2 protons).\n        *   The predicted splitting pattern is: doublet (from H(f)), triplet (from the C2-CH₂), and another triplet (from the ethyl CH₂). This gives a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second signal.\n\n    Since candidate C is the only structure that contains protons corresponding to both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal, it must be the correct compound. A quick check of the other structures confirms they do not satisfy both conditions. For example, structure B has a `dtt` but no `dtq`, while structure A has a `dtq` but no `dtt`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
