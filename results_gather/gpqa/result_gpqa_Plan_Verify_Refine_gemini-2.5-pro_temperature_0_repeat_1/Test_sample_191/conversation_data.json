    "*   **Plan:**\n    1.  Analyze the charge induction on the inner and outer surfaces of the spherical conductor due to the charge `+q` inside the cavity.\n    2.  Apply the principle of electrostatic shielding to determine the distribution of charge on the outer surface.\n    3.  Calculate the electric field at the external point P based on the charge distribution on the outer surface.\n\n*   **Action (Execution of Plan):**\n    1.  **Charge Induction:** The positive charge `+q` inside the cavity will attract an equal amount of negative charge from the conductor to the inner surface of the cavity. Therefore, a charge of `-q` is induced on the cavity's inner wall. Since the conductor was initially uncharged, to maintain overall neutrality, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n    2.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** The conducting material shields the outer surface from the arrangement of charges inside. This means the charge `+q` on the outer surface is not affected by the position of the cavity or the charge `+q` within it. Because the outer surface is a sphere of radius `R`, this charge `+q` will distribute itself *uniformly* over the outer surface.\n\n    3.  **Electric Field Calculation:** The electric field at any point outside a conductor is determined solely by the charge on its outer surface. The net electric field at point P from the original charge `+q` and the induced charge `-q` on the inner wall is zero. Therefore, the field at P is only due to the `+q` charge distributed uniformly on the outer spherical surface. For any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell, the electric field is the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere.\n\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   The center of this charge distribution is the center of the spherical conductor.\n    *   The distance from the center of the conductor to point P is `L`.\n\n    Using the formula for the electric field of a point charge:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{charge}}{\\text{distance}^2}$\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n    The other parameters like `r`, `s`, `l`, and `Î¸` are irrelevant for calculating the field outside the conductor due to the shielding effect. The correct answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
