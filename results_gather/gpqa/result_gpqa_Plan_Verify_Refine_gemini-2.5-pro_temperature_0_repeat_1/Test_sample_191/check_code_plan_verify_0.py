    # Principle 1: Charge Induction & Conservation.
    # The charge +q inside the cavity induces a charge -q on the inner wall.
    # Since the conductor was initially uncharged, a charge of +q must appear
    # on the outer surface to maintain overall neutrality.

    # Principle 2: Electrostatic Shielding (Faraday Cage) and Shell Theorem.
    # The conducting material shields the outer surface from the charges inside.
    # This means the +q charge on the outer surface distributes itself *uniformly*,
    # as if the cavity and the inner charge did not exist.
    # For any point outside a uniformly charged sphere, the electric field is
    # identical to that of a point charge of the same total magnitude located
    # at the center of the sphere.

    # The effective charge for the external field is the charge on the outer surface.

    # The effective distance is from the center of the outer sphere (the conductor's center)
    # to the external point P. This distance is given as L.

    # Using the formula for the electric field of a point charge: E = k * Q / d^2
