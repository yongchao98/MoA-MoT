def check_retrovirus_diagnostic_kit_answer():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer for designing a
    diagnostic kit for a retrovirus.

    It evaluates each option based on established biological principles:
    1.  A retrovirus has an RNA genome.
    2.  Molecular diagnostics for RNA viruses using PCR require a reverse transcription step to create cDNA.
    3.  Designing a specific molecular test requires the pathogen's genetic sequence, not just symptoms.
    4.  Immunological tests (like ELISA) are not molecular tests.
    5.  IgG antibodies indicate a later or past infection, not ideal for "quick" early diagnosis.
    6.  Real-time PCR (qPCR) is a gold-standard for rapid and sensitive molecular detection.

Second, it targets IgG antibodies, which are markers for a later-stage or past infection, making it unsuitable for 'quick' early detection."

            "is_correct": False,
            "reason": "This option is incorrect because identifying a virus based on symptoms is not specific enough to design a molecular test. The design of PCR primers requires precise genetic sequence information, which cannot be obtained from symptoms alone."

This provides the necessary sequence data. 2) Develop a 'real time PCR' kit (also known as RT-qPCR for RNA viruses), which is the modern standard for quick, sensitive, and accurate molecular diagnosis."
