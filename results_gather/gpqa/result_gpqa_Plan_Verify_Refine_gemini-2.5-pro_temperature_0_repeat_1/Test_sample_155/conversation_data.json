    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  Determine the stereochemical outcome of Reaction 1: the anti-dihydroxylation of (E)-oct-4-ene.\n2.  Determine the stereochemical outcome of Reaction 2: the anti-dihydroxylation of (Z)-oct-4-ene.\n3.  Identify all the stereoisomers present in the combined product mixture.\n4.  Predict the number of peaks for the mixture on an achiral HPLC column, which separates diastereomers but not enantiomers.\n5.  Predict the number of peaks for the mixture on a chiral HPLC column, which separates all stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n\nI will now execute this plan. The reaction sequence (mCPBA followed by aqueous acid) results in the anti-dihydroxylation of the starting alkene. I can determine the products without needing a search or calculation.\n\n**Step 1 & 2: Determine Reaction Products**\n*   **Reaction 1:** Starts with (E)-oct-4-ene (a trans-alkene). Anti-dihydroxylation of a trans-alkene results in a meso compound.\n    *   Product 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol. This is a single, achiral compound.\n*   **Reaction 2:** Starts with (Z)-oct-4-ene (a cis-alkene). Anti-dihydroxylation of a cis-alkene results in a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n    *   Product 2: A racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture**\nThe final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  meso-octane-4,5-diol\n2.  (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n3.  (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\nThe meso compound is a diastereomer to the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) compounds. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) compounds are enantiomers of each other.\n\n**Step 4: Predict Standard (Achiral) HPLC Result**\nA standard, achiral HPLC column separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties.\n*   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute at the same time, appearing as a single peak.\n*   Diastereomers have different physical properties and will elute at different times, appearing as separate peaks.\nTherefore, the racemic pair of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diol will co-elute as one peak. The meso-diol, being a diastereomer to the enantiomeric pair, will elute as a second, separate peak.\n*   **Result: 2 peaks.**\n\n**Step 5: Predict Chiral HPLC Result**\nA chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with each enantiomer, allowing for their separation. It will also separate diastereomers.\n*   The (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol enantiomers will be resolved into two separate peaks.\n*   The meso-diol will also be resolved as a distinct peak.\n*   **Result: 3 peaks.**\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<B>>>"
