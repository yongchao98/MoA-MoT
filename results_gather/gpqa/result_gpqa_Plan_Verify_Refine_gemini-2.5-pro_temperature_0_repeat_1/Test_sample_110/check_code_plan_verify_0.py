    # --- Analysis of Reaction A ---
    # Reaction: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)
    # This is a Michael Addition.
    # The base (t-BuOK) creates an enolate from the ketone.
    # The ketone has two alpha-carbons: C2 and C6.
    # C2 is quaternary (bonded to an ethyl and a methyl group) and has no alpha-hydrogens.
    # C6 has one alpha-hydrogen.
    # Therefore, deprotonation MUST occur at C6.
    # The C6 enolate then attacks the beta-carbon of ethyl acrylate.
    
    # Let's derive the product structure from the mechanism.
    # Reactant ketone SMILES: CCC1(C)C(=O)C(C)CCC1
    # The product is formed by adding a -CH2CH2COOEt group to C6.
    # SMILES of the product derived from the mechanism:
    product_A_from_mechanism_smiles = "CCC1(C)C(=O)C(C(CC(=O)OCC)C)CC1"
    mol_A_mech = Chem.MolFromSmiles(product_A_from_mechanism_smiles)
    
    # Now, let's check the IUPAC name provided in the answer.
    # The name `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate` implies:
    # 1. The main chain is an ethyl propanoate.
    # 2. The substituent is a cyclohexyl ring attached at position 3 of the propanoate.
    # 3. The cyclohexyl substituent is named by setting the attachment point as C1'.
    # 4. The oxo (=O) group is at C2'.
    # This naming is consistent with the product formed, where the original C6 becomes C1' and the original C1 (carbonyl) becomes C2'.
    # The alternative name in other options, `...-4-oxocyclohexyl...`, is inconsistent because the carbonyl group does not move from its position adjacent to the site of attack.
    
    # Let's verify the molecular formula as a sanity check.

    # --- Analysis of Reaction B ---
    # Reaction: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile (KOH)
    # This is also a Michael Addition.
    # The base (KOH) deprotonates the carbon alpha to the electron-withdrawing nitro group.
    # The resulting carbanion attacks the beta-carbon of the unsaturated nitrile.
    
    # Let's derive the product structure from the mechanism.
    # Reactants: CCC[N+](=O)[O-] (1-nitropropane) + C/C=C/C#N (but-2-enenitrile)
    # Product is formed by bonding the alpha-carbon of nitropropane to the beta-carbon of the nitrile.

    # Now, let's check the IUPAC name provided in the answer: "3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile"

    # Let's check the name from the answer against this formula.
    # "3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile" -> hexanenitrile (6C) + methyl (1C) = 7 carbons. This matches.

    # The name for product A is consistent with the only possible regiochemistry of the Michael addition.
    # The name for product B is consistent with the reaction mechanism and obeys atom conservation, unlike the alternative name provided in other options.
    # Since the selected answer 'A' contains the correct names for both products, the answer is correct.
