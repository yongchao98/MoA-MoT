    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Analyze Reaction A:**\n    *   Identify the reactants: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one (a ketone), ethyl acrylate (a Michael acceptor), and t-BuOK (a strong, bulky base).\n    *   Determine the reaction type: This is a Michael addition.\n    *   Identify the nucleophile: The base will deprotonate the ketone at an α-carbon to form an enolate. We must determine which α-carbon is deprotonated.\n    *   Predict the product structure resulting from the nucleophilic attack.\n    *   Determine the correct IUPAC name for the product and compare it with the options.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction B:**\n    *   Identify the reactants: 1-nitropropane, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (a Michael acceptor), and KOH (a base).\n    *   Determine the reaction type: This is also a Michael addition.\n    *   Identify the nucleophile: The base will deprotonate the carbon α to the nitro group.\n    *   Predict the product structure resulting from the nucleophilic attack.\n    *   Determine the correct IUPAC name for the product and compare it with the options.\n\n3.  **Synthesize and Conclude:**\n    *   Combine the correct product identifications for A and B to select the final answer from the given choices.\n\nI will now execute the plan. I will start by analyzing Reaction A.\n\n**Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n*   **Reactants:** The ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The α-carbons are C2 and C6.\n*   **Enolate Formation:** The base, t-BuOK, is a strong, bulky base used to form enolates. We must check for available α-hydrogens.\n    *   C2 is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon with no α-hydrogens.\n    *   C6 is substituted with a methyl group and has one α-hydrogen.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation can *only* occur at the C6 position. The base removes the proton from C6 to form the enolate.\n*   **Michael Addition:** The C6 of the enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the acrylate chain.\n*   **Product A Structure:** The resulting product has the `–CH₂–CH₂–COOEt` group attached to the C6 position of the original ketone.\n*   **Naming Product A:** The options name the product as a substituted ethyl propanoate.\n    *   The main chain is `ethyl propanoate`.\n    *   The cyclohexyl ring is a substituent at position 3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the cyclohexyl substituent, the point of attachment (the original C6) is designated as C1 of the ring.\n    *   Numbering proceeds around the ring to give the principal functional group (the ketone) the lowest possible number. Thus, the carbonyl carbon (original C1) is C2.\n    *   The substituents on the ring are: a methyl group at the new C1 (from the original C6-methyl), an oxo group at the new C2, and an ethyl and a methyl group at the new C3 (from the original C2 substituents).\n    *   The name of the substituent is therefore (3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl).\n    *   The full name for product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This matches the name for A in options A and D.\n\nNow, I will analyze Reaction B.\n\n**Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n*   **Reactants:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂), (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN), and KOH (base).\n*   **Nucleophile Formation:** The base KOH deprotonates the carbon α to the electron-withdrawing nitro group in 1-nitropropane. This forms a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate): `CH₃CH₂CH⁻NO₂`.\n*   **Michael Addition:** This carbanion attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile (CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN).\n*   **Product B Structure:** A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. The resulting structure is: `(NO₂)CH(CH₂CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n*   **Naming Product B:** The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so this carbon is C1.\n    *   Numbering the longest carbon chain containing the nitrile gives a six-carbon chain (hexanenitrile).\n    *   `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH(NO₂)(4)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The full name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This matches the name for B in options A and B.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*   Product A is ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate.\n*   Product B is 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile.\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies both major products is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
