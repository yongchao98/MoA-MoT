def check_answer_correctness():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer for the reaction
    of 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol with bromine.

    It works by:
    1.  Defining the reactant's structure and the chemical rules for enol halogenation.
    2.  Applying these rules to predict the structure of the major product.
    3.  Representing the structures of the multiple-choice options.
    4.  Comparing the predicted product with the product corresponding to the given answer.
    5.  Returning "Correct" if they match, or a detailed reason if they do not.

    # --- Step 1: Define Reactant and Reaction Rules ---
    # Reactant: 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol
    # Key features:
    # - A 5-carbon ring (cyclopentane skeleton).
    # - An enol functional group, which we define by the positions of the hydroxyl group
    #   and the double bond. By convention, the C=C is between C1 and C2, and the -OH is on C1.
    # - Two methyl groups are located at position C4.
    #
    # Reaction: Halogenation of an enol with Bromine (Br2).
    # Key Rules:
    # - Rule 1 (Regioselectivity): The reaction is an alpha-halogenation. The bromine atom adds to the
    #   "alpha-carbon" of the enol. The alpha-carbon is the carbon atom in the C=C double bond
    #   that is *not* bonded to the hydroxyl group. In this case, it's C2.
    # - Rule 2 (Functional Group Transformation): The enol tautomerizes to its more stable
    #   keto form. This means the C1-OH group and the C1=C2 double bond are converted into a
    #   carbonyl group (C=O) at C1.
    # - Rule 3 (Exclusion): This is not a simple electrophilic addition across the double bond,
    #   which would yield a dibromo-alcohol.

    # --- Step 2: Predict the Product ---
    # Applying the rules to 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol:
    # - From Rule 1: A bromine atom is added to C2.
    # - From Rule 2: A ketone (C=O) group is formed at C1.
    # - The methyl groups at C4 are spectators and remain unchanged.
    #
    # This results in a product with a cyclopentanone skeleton, a bromine at C2,
    # and two methyl groups at C4.
    # The systematic name is 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.
