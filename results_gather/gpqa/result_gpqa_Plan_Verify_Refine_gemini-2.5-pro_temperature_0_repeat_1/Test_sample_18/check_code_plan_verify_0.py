    # --- Verification Logic ---
    
    # Part 1: Analyze Reaction A
    # In methyl 2-oxocyclohexane-1-carboxylate, the proton at C1 is alpha to two carbonyl groups (ketone and ester).
    # The proton at C3 is only alpha to the ketone.
    # Therefore, the C1 proton is significantly more acidic and will be deprotonated by the base (NaOEt) to form the enolate.
    # The Michael addition will occur at C1.
    correct_substitution_position_A = 1
    
    # Check which options have the correct substitution at C1 for product A.
    valid_options_for_A = []
    for option, products in options.items():
        # Use regex to find the substitution position number in the name of product A.
        match = re.search(r'methyl (\d+)-\(', products["A"])
        if match:
            position = int(match.group(1))
            if position == correct_substitution_position_A:

    if not ('A' in valid_options_for_A and 'C' in valid_options_for_A):
        return f"Reason: Incorrect analysis of Reaction A. The Michael addition should occur at the C1 position, which is alpha to both carbonyls. The code expected options A and C to be valid for product A, but found {valid_options_for_A}."

    # Part 2: Analyze Reaction B
    # Nucleophile precursor: ethyl 2-ethylbutanoate -> CH3CH2-CH(Et)-COOEt
    # The alpha-carbon is CH(Et). The enolate formed will add the -CH(Et)COOEt fragment.
    # This fragment contains ONE ethyl group attached to the alpha-carbon.
    
    # Let's analyze the product B structure in options B and C.
    # Name: 4-ethyl 1-methyl 2-cyclopentyl-3,3-diethyl-2-phenylsuccinate
    # The key part of this name is "3,3-diethyl". This implies a C(Et)2 fragment.
    # The nucleophile precursor, ethyl 2-ethylbutanoate, does not have a C(Et)2 fragment. It cannot form one under these conditions.
    # Therefore, the succinate structure is impossible to form from the given reactants.
    
    product_B_in_C_is_possible = False
