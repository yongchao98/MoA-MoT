    This function checks the correctness of the answer to the electrochemistry question.

    It verifies two key concepts:
    1.  Thermodynamic strength of oxygen as an oxidant in basic vs. acidic solutions, based on standard reduction potentials.
    2.  Kinetic rate of oxygen reduction, based on established electrochemical principles.

    # In acidic solution: O2 + 4H+ + 4e- -> 2H2O

    # In basic solution: O2 + 2H2O + 4e- -> 4OH-
