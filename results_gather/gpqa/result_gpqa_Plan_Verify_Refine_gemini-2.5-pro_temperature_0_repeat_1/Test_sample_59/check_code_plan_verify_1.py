    This function checks the correctness of the LLM's answer for the relativistic space travel problem.

    It calculates:
    1. The time elapsed in Earth's reference frame.
    2. The Lorentz factor (gamma).
    3. The time elapsed for the astronaut (proper time).
    4. The astronaut's age upon arrival.

    It then checks two main conditions:
    1. Does the astronaut survive the journey (i.e., is their final age less than their lifespan)?
    2. Does the calculated journey duration for the astronaut approximately match one of the given options?
