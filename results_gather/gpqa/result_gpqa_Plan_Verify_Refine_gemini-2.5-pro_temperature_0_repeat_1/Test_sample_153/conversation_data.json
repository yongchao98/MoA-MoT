    "*   **Plan:**\n    1.  Analyze the mass spectrum to determine the molecular weight and the presence of any characteristic isotopes like halogens.\n    2.  Analyze the IR spectrum to identify key functional groups present in the molecule.\n    3.  Analyze the ¹H NMR spectrum to determine the number and types of protons, their connectivity, and the substitution pattern of the aromatic ring.\n    4.  Evaluate each of the given options (A, B, C, D) against the combined spectral data to find the correct structure.\n\n*   **Execution & Analysis:**\n    *   **Mass Spectrum:** The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. The presence of a significant peak at M+2 (m/z = 158) with a relative abundance of about 32% (158/156 ≈ 0.32) is a classic isotopic signature for a molecule containing one chlorine atom (³⁵Cl:³⁷Cl ratio is ~3:1). This confirms the molecular weight is 156 g/mol (using the ³⁵Cl isotope) and the molecule contains one chlorine atom.\n    *   **IR Spectrum:** The very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretch of a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid. The strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid conjugated to an aromatic ring. These two peaks together strongly indicate the presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n        *   The singlet at 11.0 ppm integrating to 1H is in the typical region for a highly deshielded carboxylic acid proton.\n        *   The two signals in the aromatic region (7-9 ppm) are two doublets, one at 8.02 ppm (2H) and one at 7.72 ppm (2H). This symmetrical pattern of two doublets, each representing two protons, is indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **Evaluation of Options:**\n        *   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** MW = 156 g/mol (for C₇H₅³⁵ClO₂). It is a carboxylic acid, matching the IR. It is a para-substituted benzene ring, which would give the exact ¹H NMR pattern observed. This is a perfect match.\n        *   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** While it has the correct MW and is a carboxylic acid, its ortho-substitution pattern would produce a more complex ¹H NMR spectrum for the four aromatic protons, not two simple doublets.\n        *   **C) Phenyl chloroformate:** Has the correct MW, but it is an acid chloride, not a carboxylic acid. It would lack the broad O-H peak in the IR and the carboxylic acid proton at 11.0 ppm in the ¹H NMR.\n        *   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Has the correct MW, but it is an aldehyde with a phenol group. It would lack the carboxylic acid proton signal and would show an aldehyde proton signal (~9-10 ppm). It also only has three aromatic protons, which contradicts the NMR integration (2H + 2H = 4H).\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The combined evidence from all three spectra points unambiguously to 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<A>>>"
