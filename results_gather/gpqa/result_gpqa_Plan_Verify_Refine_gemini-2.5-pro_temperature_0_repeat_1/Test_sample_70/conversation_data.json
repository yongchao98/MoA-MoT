    "*   **Plan:**\n    1.  Establish the relationship between a planet's equilibrium temperature (T_eq) and its orbital distance (semi-major axis, `a`).\n    2.  Use Kepler's Third Law to connect the orbital distance (`a`) with the orbital period (`T`).\n    3.  Combine these relationships to find how T_eq depends on `T`.\n    4.  Calculate the ratio of equilibrium temperatures for Planet_4 and Planet_2 using their given orbital period ratio.\n\n*   **Action:** Execute Python code to perform the calculation.\n    *   The equilibrium temperature `T_eq` is proportional to `1 / sqrt(a)`.\n    *   Kepler's Third Law states `T^2` is proportional to `a^3`, so `a` is proportional to `T^(2/3)`.\n    *   Therefore, `T_eq` is proportional to `1 / sqrt(T^(2/3))`, which simplifies to `1 / T^(1/3)`.\n    *   The ratio `T_eq4 / T_eq2` is then `(T2 / T4)^(1/3)`.\n    *   Given the period ratio `T1:T2:T3:T4:T5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5`, we have `T2/T4 = 2 / 3.5`.\n\n```python\n# Orbital period ratios for Planet_2 and Planet_4\nT2_ratio = 2\nT4_ratio = 3.5\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures is (T2/T4)^(1/3)\ntemp_ratio = (T2_ratio / T4_ratio)**(1/3)\n\nprint(f\"The ratio of equilibrium temperatures (Planet_4 / Planet_2) is: {temp_ratio:.4f}\")\n\n# Check which option is closest\noption_a = 0.83\noption_b = 0.75\noption_c = 0.69\noption_d = 0.57\n\nprint(f\"Option A difference: {abs(temp_ratio - option_a):.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Option B difference: {abs(temp_ratio - option_b):.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Option C difference: {abs(temp_ratio - option_c):.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Option D difference: {abs(temp_ratio - option_d):.4f}\")\n```\n\n*   **Result:**\n    <information>\n    The ratio of equilibrium temperatures (Planet_4 / Planet_2) is: 0.8299\n    Option A difference: 0.0001\n    Option B difference: 0.0799\n    Option C difference: 0.1399\n    Option D difference: 0.2599\n    </information>\n\n*   **Refinement:** The calculated ratio is approximately 0.83, which corresponds to option A. The plan was successful and the calculation is complete. I can now output the final answer.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The user has confirmed that the previous answer was correct. The logic stands:\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature:** The equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates away. This relationship is given by `T_eq ∝ (1-A)^(1/4) / sqrt(a)`, where `A` is the albedo and `a` is the semi-major axis (orbital distance). Since the albedos are the same, `T_eq ∝ 1 / sqrt(a)`.\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law:** This law relates the orbital period (`P`) to the semi-major axis (`a`): `P² ∝ a³`. This can be rearranged to `a ∝ P^(2/3)`.\n\n3.  **Combining the Laws:** We can substitute the expression for `a` from Kepler's Law into the temperature relationship:\n    `T_eq ∝ 1 / sqrt(P^(2/3))`\n    `T_eq ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)` or `T_eq ∝ P^(-1/3)`\n\n4.  **Calculating the Ratio:** We need the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 4 to Planet 2 (`T_eq4 / T_eq2`):\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P4 / P2)^(-1/3) = (P2 / P4)^(1/3)`\n\n5.  **Substituting Values:** From the problem statement, the orbital period ratio `P1:P2:P3:P4:P5` is `1:2:2.5:3.5:5`. So, `P2 = 2` and `P4 = 3.5` in these relative units.\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)`\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3)`\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.8298`\n\nThis value is closest to 0.83.\n\n<<<A>>>"
