def check_electrophilic_substitution_order():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the proposed order of substances based on their
    para-isomer yield in electrophilic bromination.

    The function uses established chemical principles to create a "correct" order
    and compares it against the proposed answer.

    Principles used:
    1.  Meta-directors (deactivating) yield the least para-product.
    2.  For meta-directors, stronger deactivation leads to less para-product.
        Deactivating strength: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5.
        Therefore, para-yield order: 4 < 6 < 2.
    3.  Ortho/para-directors yield the most para-product.
    4.  For o,p-directors, increased steric bulk favors the para-position.
        Steric bulk: -C2H5 > -CH3.
        Therefore, para-yield order: 1 < 5.
    5.  Halogens like -Cl, while deactivating, are o,p-directors with a high
        para/ortho ratio, often yielding more para-product than simple alkylbenzenes.
        Therefore, para-yield order for o,p directors is often 1 < 5 < 3.
