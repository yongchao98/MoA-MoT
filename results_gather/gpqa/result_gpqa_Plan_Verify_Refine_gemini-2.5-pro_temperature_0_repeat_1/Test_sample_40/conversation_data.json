    "This is a classic problem of relativistic velocity addition, often associated with the Fizeau experiment.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Identify the two frames of reference: the laboratory frame (S) and the rest frame of the moving glass (S').\n2.  Determine the velocities involved: the velocity of the glass relative to the lab (`v`), and the velocity of light within the glass relative to the glass (`u`).\n3.  Apply the Lorentz velocity addition formula to find the velocity of light relative to the laboratory (`u'`).\n4.  Simplify the resulting expression and compare it with the given options.\n\n**Execution:**\n\n1.  **Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **S:** The laboratory frame, where the observer is at rest.\n    *   **S':** The rest frame of the glass, which is moving with velocity `v` relative to the lab frame S.\n\n2.  **Velocities:**\n    *   The velocity of the glass (frame S') relative to the lab (frame S) is `v`.\n    *   The speed of light in a medium with refractive index `n` is `c/n`. In the rest frame of the glass (S'), the speed of the light beam is `u = c/n`. Since the problem states `c=1`, the speed of light in the glass is `u = 1/n`.\n\n3.  **Relativistic Velocity Addition:**\n    The formula for adding velocities `u` and `v` (when they are in the same direction) in special relativity is:\n    `u' = (u + v) / (1 + uv/c^2)`\n    Here, `u'` is the resultant velocity as seen from the laboratory frame S.\n\n4.  **Calculation and Simplification:**\n    Substitute the values `u = 1/n` and `c = 1` into the formula:\n    `u' = (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n)*v / 1^2)`\n    `u' = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n    To simplify the fraction, multiply the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n    `u' = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n    `u' = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
