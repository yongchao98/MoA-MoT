        # In a medium with refractive index n, the speed is c/n.
        u_prime = c / n

        # Step 2: Apply the relativistic velocity addition formula.
        # The velocity 'u' in the lab frame (S) is given by:
        # u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'*v / c^2)
        # where u' is the speed in the moving frame and v is the frame's velocity.
        derived_expr = (u_prime + v) / (1 + (u_prime * v) / c**2)

        # Step 3: Simplify the derived expression.
        # Sympy's simplify function will perform the algebraic manipulation.
        # It will substitute u_prime = 1/n and simplify the complex fraction.
        # (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n) -> ((1+nv)/n) / ((n+v)/n) -> (1+nv)/(n+v)

        # Step 4: Compare the LLM's answer with the derived correct answer.

        # simplify the difference between the two expressions. If the result is 0,
