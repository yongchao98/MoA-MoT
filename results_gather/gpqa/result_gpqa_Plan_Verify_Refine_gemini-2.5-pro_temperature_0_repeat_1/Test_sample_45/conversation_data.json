    "This is a problem of stereochemistry in an olefin metathesis reaction.\n\n*   **Plan:**\n    1.  Identify the reactant and the type of reaction.\n    2.  Determine the structure of the product formed from the self-metathesis reaction.\n    3.  Analyze the stereochemical outcomes considering the reactant is a racemic mixture.\n    4.  Count the total number of distinct stereoisomers produced.\n\n*   **Execution:**\n    1.  **Reactant and Reaction:** The reactant is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. This means we have a 50:50 mixture of (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene and (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene. The reaction is a self-metathesis catalyzed by Grubbs catalyst. This reaction joins two alkene molecules at their double bonds and expels ethene.\n        `2 R-CH=CH₂  -->  R-CH=CH-R + CH₂=CH₂`\n    2.  **Product Structure:** For 3-methylpent-1-ene, the `R` group is a sec-butyl group, `CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃`. The product of the self-metathesis (excluding ethene) is 3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene.\n        `CH₃CH₂CH(CH₃)-CH=CH-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃`\n    3.  **Stereochemical Analysis:** The product has two chiral centers (at C3 and C6) and a C4=C5 double bond which can have E/Z geometry. Since the starting material is a racemic mixture of (R) and (S) enantiomers, three types of pairings can occur:\n        *   **(R) + (R) reaction:** This reaction will produce (3R, 6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. This product can exist as two geometric isomers (diastereomers):\n            *   (E)-(3R, 6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n            *   (Z)-(3R, 6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n            (This gives **2** products)\n        *   **(S) + (S) reaction:** This reaction will produce (3S, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. This also exists as two geometric isomers, which are the enantiomers of the products from the (R)+(R) reaction:\n            *   (E)-(3S, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n            *   (Z)-(3S, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n            (This gives **2** more distinct products)\n        *   **(R) + (S) cross-reaction:** This reaction will produce (3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. Again, this can exist as two geometric isomers:\n            *   (E)-(3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (This is a meso compound, as it has a center of symmetry).\n            *   (Z)-(3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (This is a chiral molecule).\n            (This gives **2** more distinct products, which are diastereomers to all the others).\n    4.  **Count Products:** Summing the distinct products from all possible reactions: 2 (from R+R) + 2 (from S+S) + 2 (from R+S) = 6.\n\nTherefore, there are 6 possible products (stereoisomers) excluding ethene.\n\n<<<C>>>"
