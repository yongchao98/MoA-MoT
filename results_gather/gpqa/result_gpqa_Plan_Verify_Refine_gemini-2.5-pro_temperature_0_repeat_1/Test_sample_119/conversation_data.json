    "*   **Plan:**\n    1.  Relate the number of stars `N` within a distance `d` to that distance, assuming a uniform spatial distribution of stars.\n    2.  Use the definition of parallax (`plx`) to relate distance `d` to `plx`.\n    3.  Combine these relationships to find how the number of stars `N` depends on `plx`.\n    4.  Differentiate the expression for `N(plx)` to find the number of stars per unit range of parallax (`dN/dplx`) and determine its proportionality to `plx`.\n\n*   **Action:**\n    Let's execute the plan step-by-step without using code, as this is a theoretical derivation.\n\n    1.  **Number of stars vs. Distance:** Assuming a uniform density of stars `ρ` in 3D space, the number of stars `N` within a sphere of radius `d` is proportional to the volume of that sphere.\n        *   Volume `V = (4/3)πd³`\n        *   Number of stars `N(d) = ρ * V = ρ * (4/3)πd³`\n        *   Therefore, `N ∝ d³`.\n\n    2.  **Distance vs. Parallax:** Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to distance (`d`).\n        *   `plx = 1/d` (in appropriate units, like parsecs and arcseconds).\n        *   Therefore, `d = 1/plx`.\n\n    3.  **Number of stars vs. Parallax:** Substitute the expression for `d` into the proportionality for `N`.\n        *   `N ∝ (1/plx)³ = plx⁻³`.\n        *   This expression `N(plx)` represents the cumulative number of stars with a parallax *greater than or equal to* `plx` (which corresponds to stars with a distance *less than or equal to* `d`).\n\n    4.  **Number of stars per unit parallax:** To find the number of stars per unit range of parallax, we need to find the rate of change of `N` with respect to `plx`. This is the derivative `dN/dplx`.\n        *   Let `N = k * plx⁻³` where `k` is the constant of proportionality.\n        *   `dN/dplx = d/dplx (k * plx⁻³)`\n        *   `dN/dplx = k * (-3) * plx⁻⁴`\n        *   The magnitude of this quantity is what we are interested in. So, `|dN/dplx| ∝ plx⁻⁴` or `1/plx⁴`.\n\n    The number of stars per unit range of parallax changes as `1/plx⁴`. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
