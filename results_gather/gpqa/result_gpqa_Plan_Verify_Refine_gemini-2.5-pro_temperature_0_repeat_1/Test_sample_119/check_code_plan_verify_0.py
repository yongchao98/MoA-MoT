def check_parallax_distribution_correctness():
    """
    This function uses symbolic mathematics to verify the derivation for how the number of stars
    per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, assuming a uniform star distribution.

    The derivation logic is as follows:
    1. The number of stars (N) within a sphere of radius (d) is proportional to the volume of the sphere.
       N ∝ d³
    2. Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance.
       d ∝ 1/plx
    3. Therefore, the cumulative number of stars with a parallax greater than or equal to plx is:
       N(plx) ∝ (1/plx)³ = plx⁻³
    4. The number of stars per unit range of parallax is the magnitude of the derivative of N with respect to plx, |dN/dplx|.
    
    This code checks if |dN/dplx| ∝ plx⁻⁴.
