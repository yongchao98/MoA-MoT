    "*   **Plan:**\n    1.  Analyze the provided spectroscopic data (FTIR, ¹H NMR, Mass Spec) to deduce the functional groups present in the unknown molecule.\n    2.  Calculate the degree of unsaturation (DoU) for each of the possible molecular formulas.\n    3.  Combine the information from the functional group analysis and the DoU calculations to identify the correct molecular formula.\n\n*   **Action:** Execute step 1 of the plan. I will analyze the spectroscopic data.\n\n    *   **FTIR:**\n        *   A very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid.\n        *   A strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n        *   A strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=C (alkene) stretch.\n    *   **¹H NMR:**\n        *   The presence of vinyl-hydrogens confirms the existence of a C=C double bond.\n    *   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n        *   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a classic indicator of a carboxylic acid group, corresponding to the [COOH]⁺ fragment.\n\n    *   **Conclusion from Spectroscopy:** The data strongly indicates the molecule is an **alkenoic acid**, meaning it contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). The presence of a -COOH group means the molecule must contain two oxygen atoms.\n\n*   **Refined Plan:**\n    1.  Based on the spectroscopic analysis, the molecule must contain two oxygen atoms and have at least two degrees of unsaturation (one for the C=O in the acid and one for the C=C alkene).\n    2.  Calculate the degree of unsaturation for the two formulas that contain two oxygens (C6H10O2 and C6H12O2) to see which one matches the required DoU.\n    3.  Select the final answer.\n\n*   **Action:** Execute step 2 of the refined plan. I will calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for the relevant formulas. The formula for DoU is `C + 1 - H/2`.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_dou(formula):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Degree of Unsaturation for a C, H, O formula.\"\"\"\n    if formula == \"C6H10O2\":\n        C, H = 6, 10\n    elif formula == \"C6H12O2\":\n        C, H = 6, 12\n    else:\n        return \"Invalid formula for this step\"\n    \n    dou = C + 1 - (H / 2)\n    print(f\"The Degree of Unsaturation for {formula} is: {int(dou)}\")\n\ncalculate_dou(\"C6H10O2\")\ncalculate_dou(\"C6H12O2\")\n```\n\n*   **Result:**\n```\nThe Degree of Unsaturation for C6H10O2 is: 2\nThe Degree of Unsaturation for C6H12O2 is: 1\n```\n\n*   **Refined Plan:**\n    1.  The spectroscopic data confirmed the presence of a C=O bond and a C=C bond, which requires a total of 2 degrees of unsaturation.\n    2.  The calculation shows that C6H10O2 has a DoU of 2, while C6H12O2 has a DoU of 1.\n    3.  Therefore, the only formula that fits all the evidence (two oxygens for the carboxylic acid and a DoU of 2 for the C=O and C=C bonds) is C6H10O2.\n\n*   **Final Answer:** The evidence points conclusively to C6H10O2.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n1.  **FTIR Analysis:**\n    *   A very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   A strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   A strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), indicating an alkene.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is likely an alkenoic acid (contains both a carboxylic acid and an alkene).\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   The observation of peaks for vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a classic fragmentation pattern for a carboxylic acid, corresponding to the [COOH]⁺ ion. This strongly confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n4.  **Putting it all together:**\n    *   The presence of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) means the molecule must contain **two oxygen atoms**. This eliminates options A (C6H10O) and D (C6H12O).\n    *   We are left with C6H10O2 and C6H12O2.\n    *   The evidence points to the presence of both a carbonyl group (C=O) and an alkene group (C=C). Each of these features represents one degree of unsaturation. Therefore, the molecule must have at least **two degrees of unsaturation**.\n    *   Let's calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for the remaining options using the formula: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n        *   For **C6H10O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This matches our requirement.\n        *   For **C6H12O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This does not fit the evidence, as it only accounts for one double bond (e.g., the C=O in the acid) but not the additional C=C alkene.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:** The only formula that accounts for all the spectroscopic evidence (two oxygens, a C=O bond, and a C=C bond) is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
