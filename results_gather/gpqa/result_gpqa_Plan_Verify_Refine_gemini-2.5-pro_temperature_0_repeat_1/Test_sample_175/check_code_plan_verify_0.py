def check_quantum_measurement_probability():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the answer to the given quantum mechanics problem.
    It calculates the required probability step-by-step and compares it to the provided options.

    The problem asks for the probability of measuring P=0 and then Q=-1.
    The steps are:
    1. Define the initial state and operators.
    2. Normalize the initial state.
    3. Calculate the probability of the first measurement (P=0) and find the collapsed state.
    4. Calculate the probability of the second measurement (Q=-1) on the collapsed state.
    5. Multiply the probabilities to get the final joint probability.
    6. Compare the result with the expected answer (Option C: 1/6).
