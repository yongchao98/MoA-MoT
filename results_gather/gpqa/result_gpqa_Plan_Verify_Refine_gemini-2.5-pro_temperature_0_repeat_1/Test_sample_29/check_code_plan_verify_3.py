def check_dye_color_answer():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer about the absorbed color of a textile dye.
    
    The logic follows these steps:
    1. Calculate the wavelength of the emitted light from its energy.
    2. Identify the color of the emitted light.
    3. Apply the Stokes Shift principle: absorbed wavelength < emitted wavelength.
    4. Check if the provided answer satisfies this principle and if other options are correctly eliminated.
