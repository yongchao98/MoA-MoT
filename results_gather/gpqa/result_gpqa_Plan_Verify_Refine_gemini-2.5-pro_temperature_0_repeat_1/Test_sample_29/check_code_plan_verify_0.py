    Checks the correctness of the answer to the textile dye color problem.
    
    The logic is as follows:
    1. Calculate the wavelength of the emitted light from its energy.
    2. Identify the color of the emitted light.
    3. Apply the Stokes Shift principle: absorbed light must have higher energy (shorter wavelength).
    4. From the valid options, select the most probable one based on spectral adjacency.
    5. Compare the result with the provided answer.
