def check_dye_color_answer():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the LLM's answer about the absorbed color of a dye.

    The logic is as follows:
    1.  Calculate the wavelength of the emitted light from the given energy.
    2.  Apply the Stokes shift principle: The absorbed light must have a shorter wavelength
        (higher energy) than the emitted light.
    3.  Check if the LLM's chosen answer satisfies this principle.
    4.  Check if the other options are correctly evaluated based on this principle.
