    moles_hpo4 = mass_na2hpo4_2h2o / mw_na2hpo4_2h2o

    # 2. Calculate initial concentrations of the buffer components.

    conc_h2po4 = moles_h2po4 / volume_L
    # [HPO4^2-] is the concentration of the conjugate base.

    # The buffer system is H2PO4- <=> H+ + HPO4^2-, which is governed by Ka2.
    # Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]
    # We can assume the initial concentrations are approximately the equilibrium concentrations.
