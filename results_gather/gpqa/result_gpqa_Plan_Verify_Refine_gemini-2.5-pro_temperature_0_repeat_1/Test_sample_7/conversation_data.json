  "question": "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n\nA) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1\nB) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nC) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1\nD) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>",

    "*   **Plan:**\n    1.  Analyze the phenotypes of single mutants to understand the individual contribution of each gene to resistance.\n    2.  Analyze the phenotypes of double mutants to determine epistatic relationships (where one gene's effect masks another's).\n    3.  Use the epistasis results to deduce the gene pathway, identifying the upstream transcription factor.\n    4.  Characterize the specific interaction between G1 and G3 based on the `g1g3` double mutant.\n    5.  Compare these conclusions with the given options to find the best fit.\n\n*   **Execution & Refinement:**\n    1.  **Single Mutants:** The severity of the phenotype (loss of resistance) is g2 (0% resistance) > g3 (50%) > g1 (75%). This indicates G2 is the most critical gene for resistance.\n    2.  **Epistasis Analysis:**\n        *   The `g1g2` double mutant has 0% resistance, which is identical to the `g2` single mutant's phenotype. This means **G2 is epistatic to G1**.\n        *   The `g2g3` double mutant also has 0% resistance, identical to the `g2` single mutant. This means **G2 is epistatic to G3**.\n    3.  **Pathway and TF Identification:** A gene that is epistatic to other genes in a pathway typically functions upstream. Since G2's phenotype masks both G1's and G3's, G2 is the upstream regulator. The problem states one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream, so **G2 is the transcription factor**.\n    4.  **G1 and G3 Interaction:** The `g1g3` double mutant has 10% resistance. This phenotype is more severe than that of either single mutant (`g1`=75%, `g3`=50%). This synergistic effect, where the combined loss of function is greater than the sum of individual losses, is a classic sign of **gene redundancy**. G1 and G3 likely perform partially overlapping functions downstream of G2.\n    5.  **Evaluate Options:**\n        *   A) Incorrectly identifies G1 as the transcription factor.\n        *   B) Correctly identifies G2 as the TF, but \"pleiotropy\" is a less accurate description of the G1/G3 interaction than \"redundancy\". Also incorrectly claims G1 is epistatic to G3.\n        *   C) Correctly identifies G2 as the TF, but makes an unsubstantiated claim about a shared promoter and incorrectly claims G3 is epistatic to G1.\n        *   D) Correctly identifies **G2 as the transcription factor** and correctly describes the G1/G3 interaction as **gene redundancy**. The final clause, \"G1 is epistatic towards G3,\" is inconsistent with the data (the g1g3 phenotype of 10% is not the g1 phenotype of 75%). However, the first two statements in this option are the most accurate and significant conclusions that can be drawn from the experiment. Among the given choices, this is the best description of the genetic interactions.\n\n<<<D>>>"
