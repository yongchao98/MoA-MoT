    "*   **Plan:**\n    1.  Identify the quantum mechanical system from the given potential.\n    2.  Write down the energy eigenvalue formula for this system.\n    3.  Determine the quantum number corresponding to the third excited state.\n    4.  Calculate the energy of the third excited state using the formula.\n    5.  Calculate the degeneracy (number of linearly independent eigenfunctions) for this energy level.\n    6.  Compare the results with the given options.\n\n*   **Execution:**\n    1.  The potential $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$ corresponds to a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator.\n    2.  The energy eigenvalues for this system are given by the formula $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega$, where the principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$.\n    3.  The states are defined by the value of $n$:\n        *   Ground state: $n=0$\n        *   First excited state: $n=1$\n        *   Second excited state: $n=2$\n        *   Third excited state: $n=3$\n    4.  For the third excited state, we set $n=3$ in the energy formula:\n        $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n    5.  The degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ is the number of different combinations of non-negative integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to $n$. The formula for the degeneracy $g_n$ is $g_n = \\frac{(n+2)(n+1)}{2}$. For the third excited state ($n=3$):\n        $g_3 = \\frac{(3+2)(3+1)}{2} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2} = 10$.\n        Alternatively, we can list the possible combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to 3:\n        *   Permutations of (3, 0, 0): (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3) -> 3 states\n        *   Permutations of (2, 1, 0): (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2) -> 6 states\n        *   Permutations of (1, 1, 1): (1,1,1) -> 1 state\n        Total number of states (degeneracy) = 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.\n    6.  The energy of the third excited state is $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega$, and its degeneracy is 10. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
