    "*   **Plan:**\n    1.  Establish the formula for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures, which depends on the ratio of the planets' semi-major axes.\n    2.  Determine the relationship between a planet's semi-major axis, its mass, and the radial velocity (RV) amplitude it induces on its star.\n    3.  Calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes using the given planet masses and RV-induced Doppler shifts.\n    4.  Finally, compute the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures.\n\n*   **Action:**\n    Let's execute the plan. The equilibrium temperature `T_eq` is proportional to `1/sqrt(a)`, where `a` is the semi-major axis. Therefore, the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)`.\n\n    The radial velocity amplitude `K` is proportional to `M_p / sqrt(a)`, where `M_p` is the planet's mass. This means `a` is proportional to `(M_p / K)^2`.\n    So, `a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / K2)^2 / (M_p1 / K1)^2 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2`.\n\n    The RV amplitude `K` is directly proportional to the Doppler shift `Δλ`.\n    `K1 / K2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2`.\n\n    Now, let's plug in the values and calculate the final ratio.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\n# Planet 1\nm1 = 7.0  # Earth masses\nd_lambda1 = 0.03  # Angstroms\n\n# Planet 2\nm2 = 5.0  # Earth masses\nd_lambda2 = 0.04  # Angstroms\n\n# The ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes (K1/K2) is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts.\nK1_div_K2 = d_lambda1 / d_lambda2\n\n# The ratio of the planet masses (M_p2/M_p1).\nm2_div_m1 = m2 / m1\n\n# The ratio of the semi-major axes (a2/a1) is given by:\n# a2/a1 = (m2/m1)^2 * (K1/K2)^2\na2_div_a1 = (m2_div_m1)**2 * (K1_div_K2)**2\n\n# The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures (T_eq1/T_eq2) is sqrt(a2/a1).\nT_ratio = math.sqrt(a2_div_a1)\n\nprint(f\"Ratio of RV amplitudes (K1/K2): {K1_div_K2}\")\nprint(f\"Ratio of planet masses (m2/m1): {m2_div_m1}\")\nprint(f\"Ratio of semi-major axes (a2/a1): {a2_div_a1}\")\nprint(f\"Ratio of equilibrium temperatures (T_eq1/T_eq2): {T_ratio}\")\n\n# Let's also calculate it with fractions to see the exact value\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\nK1_div_K2_f = Fraction(3, 4)\nm2_div_m1_f = Fraction(5, 7)\na2_div_a1_f = (m2_div_m1_f)**2 * (K1_div_K2_f)**2\n# T_ratio = sqrt(a2/a1) = (m2/m1) * (K1/K2)\nT_ratio_f = m2_div_m1_f * K1_div_K2_f\nprint(f\"Exact fraction for the temperature ratio: {T_ratio_f}\")\nprint(f\"Decimal value of the exact fraction: {float(T_ratio_f)}\")\n```\n\n*   **Result:**\n    ```text\n    Ratio of RV amplitudes (K1/K2): 0.75\n    Ratio of planet masses (m2/m1): 0.7142857142857143\n    Ratio of semi-major axes (a2/a1): 0.2869897959183673\n    Ratio of equilibrium temperatures (T_eq1/T_eq2): 0.5357142857142857\n    Exact fraction for the temperature ratio: 15/28\n    Decimal value of the exact fraction: 0.5357142857142857\n    ```\nThe calculated ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is approximately 0.536. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
