    "*   **Plan:**\n    1.  Systematically determine the structure of the product for each step of the reaction sequence (A, B, C, D, E).\n    2.  Analyze the molecular symmetry of the final product, E.\n    3.  Count the number of chemically non-equivalent carbon atoms in structure E to find the number of 13C-NMR signals.\n\n*   **Execution:**\n    1.  **Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF3 → A:** Propionaldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO) reacts with 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT) to protect the carbonyl group, forming a cyclic thioacetal. Product **A** is 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiane.\n    2.  **A + BuLi → B:** Butyllithium (BuLi) is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton in A, which is the one on the carbon between the two sulfur atoms (C2). Product **B** is the lithium salt of the 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiane carbanion.\n    3.  **B + Bromoethane → C:** The carbanion B acts as a nucleophile, attacking bromoethane (CH₃CH₂Br) to add a second ethyl group at the C2 position. Product **C** is 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiane.\n    4.  **C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D:** The thioacetal group is deprotected (hydrolyzed) back to a carbonyl group using mercuric chloride. Product **D** is diethyl ketone, also known as 3-pentanone ((CH₃CH₂)₂C=O).\n    5.  **D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E:** This is a Wittig reaction.\n        *   First, the Wittig ylide is formed from 3-bromopentane ((CH₃CH₂)₂CHBr), triphenylphosphine (PPh₃), and BuLi. The ylide is (1-ethylpropylidene)triphenylphosphine, (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃.\n        *   Then, this ylide reacts with the ketone D (3-pentanone). The C=O bond of the ketone is replaced by a C=C bond from the ylide.\n        *   (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O + (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃ → (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₃CH₂)₂ + Ph₃P=O\n        *   The final product **E** is 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene.\n\n*   **Symmetry Analysis of E (3,4-diethylhex-3-ene):**\n    The structure of E is:\n    ```\n          CH₂CH₃\n          |\n    CH₃CH₂-C=C-CH₂CH₃\n          |\n          CH₂CH₃\n    ```\n    This molecule is highly symmetrical. It possesses a C₂ axis of symmetry passing through the midpoint of the C=C double bond. This symmetry makes the four ethyl groups chemically equivalent.\n    *   **Signal 1:** The two sp²-hybridized carbons of the central double bond (C=C) are equivalent.\n    *   **Signal 2:** Within each of the four equivalent ethyl groups, the methylene (-CH₂-) carbons are in an identical environment. Thus, all four -CH₂- carbons give a single signal.\n    *   **Signal 3:** Similarly, the methyl (-CH₃) carbons of the four equivalent ethyl groups are all in an identical environment and produce a single signal.\n\n    Therefore, the molecule will show a total of 3 signals in its ¹³C-NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>"
