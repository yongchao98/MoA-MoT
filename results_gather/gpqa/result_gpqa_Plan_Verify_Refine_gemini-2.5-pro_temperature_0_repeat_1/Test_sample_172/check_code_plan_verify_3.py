    """
    Checks the correctness of the given answer for the physics problem.

    The problem asks for the minimum uncertainty in energy (ΔE) of an electron,
    given its speed (v) and the uncertainty in its position (Δx).

    The calculation follows these steps:
    1. Use Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle to find the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp_x):
       Δp_x = ħ / (2 * Δx)
    2. Use the relationship between energy and momentum uncertainty to find ΔE:
       ΔE = v * Δp_x
    3. Compare the calculated ΔE with the given options to find the best match.
