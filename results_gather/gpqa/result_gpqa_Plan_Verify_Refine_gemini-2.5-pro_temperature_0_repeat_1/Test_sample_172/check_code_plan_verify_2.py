    Checks the correctness of the calculated minimum uncertainty in energy for an electron.
    
    The problem states:
    - Speed of electron, v = 2 * 10^8 m/s
    - Uncertainty in position, Δx = 0.1 nm
    - The proposed answer is D) ~10^-16 J.

    The solution uses the following steps:
    1. Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle: Δx * Δp_x ≥ ħ/2.
       The minimum uncertainty is Δp_x = ħ / (2 * Δx).
    2. Energy-Momentum Uncertainty Relation: ΔE ≈ v * Δp_x.
