    "The problem is to find the minimum uncertainty in the energy ($\\Delta E$) of an electron given its speed ($v$) and the uncertainty in its position ($\\Delta x$).\n\n1.  **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:** The relationship between the uncertainty in position ($\\Delta x$) and the uncertainty in momentum ($\\Delta p_x$) is given by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:\n    $$ \\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p_x \\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2} $$\n    where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant ($\\approx 1.054 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J} \\cdot \\text{s}$). To find the *minimum* uncertainty, we use the equality:\n    $$ \\Delta p_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x} $$\n\n2.  **Energy-Momentum Uncertainty Relation:** The uncertainty in energy ($\\Delta E$) can be related to the uncertainty in momentum ($\\Delta p_x$) through the group velocity of the particle's wave packet, which is equal to the particle's speed, $v$. The relation is derived from $v = \\frac{dE}{dp}$, which for small uncertainties gives:\n    $$ \\Delta E \\approx v \\cdot \\Delta p_x $$\n\n3.  **Calculation:**\n    *   First, substitute the given values into the momentum uncertainty equation:\n        *   $\\Delta x = 0.1 \\text{ nm} = 0.1 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ m} = 10^{-10} \\text{ m}$\n        *   $\\hbar \\approx 1.054 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J} \\cdot \\text{s}$\n        $$ \\Delta p_x = \\frac{1.054 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J} \\cdot \\text{s}}{2 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ m}} \\approx 5.27 \\times 10^{-25} \\text{ kg} \\cdot \\text{m/s} $$\n    *   Next, use this result to find the uncertainty in energy:\n        *   $v = 2 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}$\n        $$ \\Delta E = (2 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (5.27 \\times 10^{-25} \\text{ kg} \\cdot \\text{m/s}) $$\n        $$ \\Delta E \\approx 1.054 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ J} $$\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The calculated minimum uncertainty in energy is approximately $1.054 \\times 10^{-16}$ J. This value is on the order of magnitude of $10^{-16}$ J. Comparing this with the given options:\n    *   A) ~$10^{-19}$ J\n    *   B) ~$10^{-18}$ J\n    *   C) ~$10^{-17}$ J\n    *   D) ~$10^{-16}$ J\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
