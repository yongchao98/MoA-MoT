    "*   **Plan:**\n    1.  Analyze the first reaction to identify the role and identity of reagent A. This reaction is a cyanohydrin formation.\n    2.  Analyze the second reaction to identify the role and identity of reagent B. This reaction is a nitrile hydrolysis.\n    3.  Combine the findings for A and B to select the correct multiple-choice option.\n\n*   **Execution (Analysis):**\n    1.  **Reaction 1:** `butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile`. This is a nucleophilic addition of a cyanide ion (from NaCN) to the carbonyl group of butan-2-one. The initial product is an alkoxide intermediate. Reagent 'A' is needed to protonate this alkoxide to form the final hydroxyl (-OH) group of the cyanohydrin product. An acidic workup, represented by H₃O⁺, is the standard way to achieve this protonation. Therefore, **A = H₃O⁺**.\n    2.  **Reaction 2:** `2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid`. This reaction converts a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This transformation is known as nitrile hydrolysis. It can be catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base. Looking at the options for 'B' (HCl or CH₃COOH), both are acids. However, this hydrolysis typically requires harsh conditions, making a strong acid like HCl much more effective and the standard choice over a weak acid like acetic acid (CH₃COOH). Therefore, **B = HCl**.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    Based on the analysis, A is H₃O⁺ and B is HCl. This combination matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
