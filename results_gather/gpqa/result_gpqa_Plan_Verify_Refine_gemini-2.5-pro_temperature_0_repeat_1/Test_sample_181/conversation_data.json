The key assumptions for the derivation of the standard Mott-Gurney equation ($J \\propto V^2/L^3$) are:\n\n1.  **Single-Carrier Device:** The current is dominated by only one type of charge carrier (either electrons or holes). The contribution from the other carrier type is negligible.\n2.  **Trap-Free Solid:** The material is assumed to be an ideal insulator or semiconductor with no trap states within the bandgap that can capture and immobilize the charge carriers.\n3.  **Ohmic Contact (No Injection Barrier):** One contact must be Ohmic, meaning it can supply an unlimited number of charge carriers into the device. This ensures that the current is limited by the bulk properties of the material (the space charge) rather than by the injection process at the contact. This is often described as having \"no carrier injection barrier\". The other contact is typically blocking for that carrier type.\n4.  **Negligible Diffusion Current:** The current is assumed to be dominated by the drift of carriers under the applied electric field. The contribution from diffusion current (due to carrier concentration gradients) is considered negligible. This is a good approximation when the applied voltage is sufficiently high.\n5.  **Negligible Intrinsic Carrier Concentration:** The concentration of thermally generated free carriers in the material is assumed to be negligible compared to the concentration of injected carriers.\n</information>\nNow I will evaluate the given options based on the information gathered.\n\n*   **A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.** This is incorrect.

    "<information>### Key Assumptions of the Mott-Gurney Law for Space-Charge-Limited Current\n\nThe Mott-Gurney law is a fundamental model used to describe the current-voltage relationship in insulators and semiconductors where the current is limited by the space charge of injected carriers. For the law to be applicable, several key assumptions about the material and the device structure must be met.\n\nThe primary assumptions underpinning the Mott-Gurney law are:\n\n*   **Single Carrier Type:** The model assumes that only one type of charge carrier, either electrons or holes, is present and contributes to the current.\n*   **Negligible Intrinsic Conductivity:** The material is assumed to be an ideal insulator or an intrinsic semiconductor with a negligible concentration of free carriers in thermal equilibrium. The current is therefore dominated by the carriers injected from the electrodes.\n*   **Constant Mobility and Permittivity:** The charge carrier mobility (μ) and the material's permittivity (ε) are considered to be constant throughout the sample, independent of the electric field.\n*   **Trap-Free Material:** The material is assumed to be free of traps or energetic disorder that could capture the injected charge carriers. The presence of traps can significantly alter the current-voltage characteristics.\n*   **Drift-Dominated Current:** The current is assumed to be driven solely by the drift of charge carriers under the influence of the applied electric field. The contribution of diffusion current is considered negligible.\n*   **Zero Electric Field at the Injecting Electrode:** A crucial assumption is that the electric field at the electrode from which charge carriers are injected is zero. This implies that the contact is a perfect reservoir of charge, capable of supplying as many carriers as needed to be injected into the material.\n*   **Ohmic Contacts:** The contacts, particularly the injecting contact, are assumed to be Ohmic. This means there is no energy barrier to charge injection, allowing for an unlimited supply of carriers into the material.\n\nIt is important to note that these are idealized conditions. In real-world materials and devices, particularly in organic semiconductors, deviations from these assumptions are common. Factors such as the presence of trap states, non-Ohmic contacts, and field-dependent mobility can lead to current-voltage behavior that does not follow the classic J ∝ V² relationship predicted by the Mott-Gurney law.</information>\nChecker feedback:\noutput: Correct"
