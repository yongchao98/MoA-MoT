    # In log form: log10(R) = log10((nSi/nH)_1) - log10((nSi/nH)_2)

    # log10(R) = [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2

    # 4. Calculate the final ratio
    final_ratio = 10**log_ratio

    # --- Final Verification ---
    # The LLM's calculation resulted in 10^0.6, which is approximately 3.98.
    # This corresponds to option B) ~3.9.
