    # --- Calculation ---
    # The abundance notation [X/Y] follows the identity: [A/C] = [A/B] + [B/C]
    # The ratio of silicon atoms is interpreted as the ratio of their abundances relative to Hydrogen:
    # Ratio = (n_Si/n_H)_1 / (n_Si/n_H)_2

    # Step 1: Determine [Si/H] for Star 1
    # [Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1
    Si_H_1 = Si_Fe_1 + Fe_H_1

    # Step 2: Determine [Si/H] for Star 2
    # [Mg/H]_2 = [Mg/Si]_2 + [Si/H]_2  =>  [Si/H]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Mg/Si]_2
    Si_H_2 = Mg_H_2 - Mg_Si_2

    # Step 3: Calculate the logarithm of the final ratio
    # log10(Ratio) = log10((n_Si/n_H)_1) - log10((n_Si/n_H)_2)
    # From the definition of dex, this simplifies to:
    # log10(Ratio) = [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2
    log10_ratio = Si_H_1 - Si_H_2

    # Step 4: Calculate the final ratio
    calculated_ratio = 10**log10_ratio

    # --- Verification ---
    # Check if the intermediate and final calculations match the LLM's reasoning
