    # Reaction 1: 1,4-conjugate addition of a methyl group to Product A.
    # The methyl group adds to the beta-carbon (C6) of the a,b-unsaturated system.
    # LLM's intermediate: 1,2-epoxy-3,3,6,6-tetramethylheptan-4-one
    # Let's build this structure based on the description:
    # Start with Product A, add a methyl to C6, and saturate the C5-C6 bond.
    # Product A: C1OC1-C(C)(C)-C(=O)-CH=C(C)C

    # This forms an alcohol at C2.

    # This step is for confirmation, the SMILES match is the definitive check.

    # - Epoxidation of the two double bonds is plausible.
    # - Reaction of a Gilman reagent with an α,β-unsaturated ketone via 1,4-addition is a classic reaction.
