    "This problem requires us to find the maximum speed of a relativistic harmonic oscillator by applying the principle of conservation of energy.\n\n*   **Plan:**\n    1.  Write down the expression for the total conserved energy of a relativistic particle in a harmonic potential.\n    2.  Evaluate this total energy at two specific points in the oscillation: the point of maximum amplitude ($x=A$) and the equilibrium position ($x=0$).\n    3.  Equate the energies at these two points and solve for the maximum speed, $v_{max}$.\n\n*   **Execution:**\n    The total conserved energy ($E_{total}$) of a relativistic particle is the sum of its relativistic energy ($\\gamma mc^2$) and its potential energy ($U(x)$). For a harmonic oscillator, $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n    Therefore, the conserved energy is:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\n    1.  **At the maximum amplitude, $x = A$:**\n        The particle is momentarily at rest, so its speed is $v=0$.\n        This means the Lorentz factor $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n        The total energy at this point is:\n        $E_{total} = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n\n    2.  **At the equilibrium position, $x = 0$:**\n        The potential energy is zero, $U(0) = 0$.\n        The speed is at its maximum, $v = v_{max}$.\n        The Lorentz factor is at its maximum, $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n        The total energy at this point is:\n        $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + 0 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$.\n\n    By the principle of conservation of energy, the total energy at both points must be equal:\n    $\\gamma_{max}mc^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n    Now, we solve for $v_{max}$. First, let's find an expression for $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2}{mc^2} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    Next, we substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    Now, we rearrange the equation to isolate $v_{max}$:\n    $\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n\n    Square both sides:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n    Solve for $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n    Finally, solve for $v_{max}$:\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n    This result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
