    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n1.  First, I will determine the molecular structure and formula of the compound (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n2.  Next, I will count the number of each type of chemical bond (C-H, C-C, C=C) in the molecule.\n3.  Then, I will use the provided data to calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) in kJ/mol using the formula: ΔH_f = (Enthalpy of atomization of reactants) - (Sum of bond energies of products).\n4.  Finally, I will calculate the molar mass of the compound and convert the enthalpy of formation from kJ/mol to kJ/g to compare with the given options.\n\nI will now execute the first two steps of my plan: determining the structure and counting the bonds.\n\nThe chemical structure is:\n```\n      CH3         CH3         CH3\n      |           |           |\nCH3 - C  =  CH - CH2 - CH - CH2 - CH = C - CH3\n```\nLet's re-examine the formula: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. My previous interpretation was incorrect. Let's break it down again carefully.\n\n*   `(CH3)2C=` : A carbon atom is bonded to two methyl groups and double-bonded to the next atom in the chain.\n*   `=CH-` : This is a CH group.\n*   `-CH2-` : This is a CH2 group.\n*   `-CH(CH3)-` : This is a CH group with a methyl group attached.\n*   `-CH2-` : This is a CH2 group.\n*   `-CH=` : This is a CH group.\n*   `=C(CH3)2` : The previous CH group is double-bonded to a carbon atom that is bonded to two methyl groups.\n\nThe correct structure is:\n```\n      CH3                             CH3\n      |                               |\nCH3 - C = CH - CH2 - CH - CH2 - CH = C - CH3\n                     |\n                     CH3\n```\nLet's verify the structure and count the atoms and bonds.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:**\n    *   Carbons (C): 2 (from (CH3)2C) + 1 (CH) + 1 (CH2) + 2 (CH(CH3)) + 1 (CH2) + 1 (CH) + 2 (C(CH3)2) = 10 carbons in the main structure + 5 methyl carbons = **C15**.\n    *   Hydrogens (H): 6 (from (CH3)2C) + 1 (CH) + 2 (CH2) + 4 (CH(CH3)) + 2 (CH2) + 1 (CH) + 6 (C(CH3)2) = **H28**.\n    *   Formula: **C15H28**\n\n*   **Bond Count:**\n    *   **C-H bonds:** There are 28 Hydrogen atoms, so there are **28 C-H bonds**.\n    *   **C=C bonds:** There are two double bonds in the structure. So, **2 C=C bonds**.\n    *   **C-C bonds:**\n        *   In the main chain: C=C-C-C-C-C=C. The single bonds are C2-C3, C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6.
