    # 1. Calculate the enthalpy of atomization of reactants.
    # The formation reaction is: 12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) -> C12H22(g)
    # Energy to atomize reactants = (12 * ΔH_atom(C)) + (11 * BE(H-H))
    enthalpy_atomization_reactants = (num_C * H_atom_C) + ((num_H / 2) * BE_HH)
    # Expected: (12 * 1000) + (11 * 100) = 12000 + 1100 = 13100 kJ

    # 2. Calculate the sum of bond energies in the product molecule.
    # Energy released on formation from atoms = (22*BE_CH) + (9*BE_CC) + (2*BE_C=C)
    sum_bond_energies_product = (num_CH_bonds * BE_CH) + (num_CC_bonds * BE_CC) + (num_C_dbl_C_bonds * BE_C_dbl_C)
    # Expected: (22 * 400) + (9 * 200) + (2 * 300) = 8800 + 1800 + 600 = 11200 kJ

    # 3. Calculate the enthalpy of formation in kJ/mol.
    # ΔH_f = (Enthalpy of atomization of reactants) - (Sum of bond energies of product)
    delta_H_f_mol = enthalpy_atomization_reactants - sum_bond_energies_product
    # Expected: 13100 - 11200 = 1900 kJ/mol

    # 4. Calculate the enthalpy of formation in kJ/g.
