    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer for the quantum mechanics problem.

    The problem is to find the normalization constant 'a' for the wave function:
    ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5*i
    for a particle that exists only in the interval x in [1, 3].

    The normalization condition is: ∫ |ψ(x)|² dx = 1 over the interval [1, 3].

    First, we find the probability density function |ψ(x)|²:
    ψ*(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) + 0.5*i  (complex conjugate)
    |ψ(x)|² = ψ*(x) * ψ(x)
            = (a / sqrt(1 + x))² + (0.5)²
            = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25

    Next, we set up and solve the normalization integral:
    ∫[1, 3] (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1
    [a² * ln(1 + x) + 0.25 * x] from 1 to 3 = 1
    (a² * ln(4) + 0.25 * 3) - (a² * ln(2) + 0.25 * 1) = 1
    a² * (ln(4) - ln(2)) + (0.75 - 0.25) = 1
    a² * ln(4/2) + 0.5 = 1
    a² * ln(2) = 0.5
    a² = 0.5 / ln(2)
    a = sqrt(0.5 / ln(2))
