    "*   **Plan:**\n    1.  Set up the normalization integral for the wave function's probability density (ψ*ψ) over the interval [1, 3], equating it to 1.\n    2.  Solve the integral analytically to find an expression for the constant 'a'.\n    3.  Use Python to compute the numerical value of 'a' and compare it with the given options.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# The normalization condition is: integral from 1 to 3 of (a^2/(1+x) + 0.25) dx = 1\n# Solving this integral gives: a^2 * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\n# Which simplifies to: a^2 = 0.5 / ln(2)\n# Now, we calculate the value of 'a'.\n\na_squared = 0.5 / np.log(2)\na = np.sqrt(a_squared)\n\nprint(f\"The value of a^2 is: {a_squared}\")\nprint(f\"The numerical value of 'a' is: {a}\")\n```\nThe calculated value for 'a' is approximately 0.854. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Based on the successful execution of the plan, the value of the constant 'a' was calculated.\n\n1.  **Derivation:** The normalization condition ∫|ψ|² dx = 1 was applied over the interval [1, 3].\n    *   |ψ|² = ψ*ψ = (a²/ (1+x)) + 0.25.\n    *   The integral ∫[1,3] ((a²/(1+x)) + 0.25) dx evaluates to a²ln(2) + 0.5.\n    *   Setting this to 1 gives a² = 0.5 / ln(2).\n\n2.  **Calculation:** The numerical value was computed as a = √(0.5 / ln(2)).\n\n3.  **Result:** The calculation yielded a ≈ 0.8493.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Comparing this result to the given options:\n    *   A) 1.1\n    *   B) 0.35\n    *   C) 0.85\n    *   D) 0.6\n\nThe value 0.8493 is closest to 0.85.\n\n<<<C>>>"
