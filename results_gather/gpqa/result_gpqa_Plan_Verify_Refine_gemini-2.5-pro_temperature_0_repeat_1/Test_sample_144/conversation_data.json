    "*   **Plan:**\n    1.  Determine the chemical structure from the IUPAC name.\n    2.  Identify all stereocenters in the molecule, which include both chiral carbons and double bonds capable of E/Z isomerism.\n    3.  Calculate the total number of possible stereoisomers using the formula 2^n, where n is the number of stereocenters.\n\n*   **Action:**\n    I will now execute the plan by analyzing the structure based on its name.\n\n    **1. Decipher the Structure:**\n    The name is **6-chloro-9-ethyl-2-methylundeca-3,7-dien-5-ol**.\n    *   **undeca**: The parent chain has 11 carbon atoms.\n    *   **-3,7-dien**: There are two double bonds, one starting at carbon 3 (between C3 and C4) and another at carbon 7 (between C7 and C8).\n    *   **-5-ol**: An alcohol group (-OH) is located on carbon 5. This is the principal functional group, so the chain is numbered to give this group the lowest possible number.\n    *   **Substituents**: A chlorine atom (**6-chloro**), an ethyl group (**9-ethyl**), and a methyl group (**2-methyl**) are attached to carbons 6, 9, and 2, respectively.\n\n    Putting it all together, the structure is:\n    `CH₃-CH(CH₃)-CH=CH-CH(OH)-CH(Cl)-CH=CH-CH(CH₂CH₃)-CH₂-CH₃`\n\n    **2. Identify Stereocenters:**\n    *   **Chiral Carbons (Asymmetric Centers):** These are carbon atoms bonded to four different groups.\n        *   **C5**: Bonded to (1) -H, (2) -OH, (3) the `-CH=CH-CH(CH₃)₂` group, and (4) the `-CH(Cl)-CH=CH-CH(C₂H₅)₂` group. All four groups are different. **C5 is a chiral center.**\n        *   **C6**: Bonded to (1) -H, (2) -Cl, (3) the `-CH(OH)-CH=CH-CH(CH₃)₂` group, and (4) the `-CH=CH-CH(C₂H₅)₂` group. All four groups are different. **C6 is a chiral center.**\n        *   Other carbons like C2 and C9 are not chiral because they are bonded to two identical groups (two methyl groups on C2, and two ethyl groups on C9).\n        *   Total chiral centers = **2**.\n\n    *   **Geometric Isomerism (E/Z Isomerism):** This occurs at double bonds where each carbon of the double bond is attached to two different groups.\n        *   **C3=C4 double bond**:\n            *   C3 is bonded to -H and an isopropyl group `(-CH(CH₃)₂)`. These are different.\n            *   C4 is bonded to -H and the rest of the chain starting with `-CH(OH)-`. These are different.\n            *   Therefore, the **C3=C4 bond can exhibit E/Z isomerism.**\n        *   **C7=C8 double bond**:\n            *   C7 is bonded to -H and the rest of the chain starting with `-CH(Cl)-`. These are different.\n            *   C8 is bonded to -H and the `(-CH(C₂H₅)₂)` group. These are different.\n            *   Therefore, the **C7=C8 bond can also exhibit E/Z isomerism.**\n        *   Total sites for geometric isomerism = **2**.\n\n    **3. Calculate Total Stereoisomers:**\n    The total number of stereocenters (n) is the sum of the chiral centers and the sites of geometric isomerism.\n    n = (Number of chiral centers) + (Number of E/Z double bonds)\n    n = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n    The maximum number of stereoisomers is calculated using the formula 2^n. Since the molecule is not symmetrical, there are no meso compounds to reduce this number.\n    Total stereoisomers = 2⁴ = 16.\n\n<<<A>>>"
