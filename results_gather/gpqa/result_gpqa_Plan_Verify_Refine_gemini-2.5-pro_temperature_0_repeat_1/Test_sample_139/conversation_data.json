    "This problem requires a step-by-step deduction to identify the unknown substances, particularly Substance X.\n\n*   **Plan:**\n    1.  Identify Substance B from its physical properties.\n    2.  Deduce the nature of the reaction and other substances (G, W, Y) based on the identity of B and the reaction description.\n    3.  Use all the clues, including its use in organic chemistry, to identify Substance X.\n    4.  Once X is identified, calculate the cumulative atomic masses of its lightest and heaviest constituent elements.\n\n*   **Execution 1: Identify Substance B**\n    The problem states that the melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K.\n    277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    This melting point is characteristic of heavy water (D₂O), which melts at 3.82 °C.\n    Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**.\n\n*   **Execution 2: Deduce G, W, Y and X**\n    *   Precipitate G releases B (D₂O) when heated. This is typical for a deuterated metal hydroxide, which decomposes to a metal oxide and D₂O. So, **G is a deuterated hydroxide**.\n    *   Gas W has an equal number of neutrons and protons. Let's consider simple molecules. Deuterium gas (D₂) consists of two deuterium atoms (¹H₂). Each D atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits the description. So, **W is likely D₂**.\n    *   The reaction is: Substance X + Liquid Y → G (deuterated hydroxide) + W (D₂ gas).\n    *   For the products to be a deuterated hydroxide and deuterium gas, the reactants must supply the metal, the deuterium, and the oxygen. The most plausible reaction is a deuterated compound reacting with heavy water (D₂O).\n    *   Let's test the clue that X's analog is a common organic reagent. Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a very common and powerful reducing agent. Its deuterated analog is **Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. This fits the description of \"incorporating a heavier isotope (D) of one of its constituent elements (H)\". Let's assume **X = LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The reaction of LiAlD₄ with heavy water (Y = D₂O) is:\n        LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂\n    *   This reaction is violent, produces a precipitate G (a mix of LiOD and Al(OD)₃), and releases gas W (D₂). This matches all the clues perfectly.\n\n*   **Execution 3: Verify with the final clue**\n    *   The reaction of a keto acid (containing both a ketone C=O and a carboxylic acid -COOH) with substance X (LiAlD₄, a strong reducing agent) is considered.\n    *   LiAlD₄ reduces both functional groups: the ketone is reduced to a secondary alcohol (-CH(OH)-) and the carboxylic acid is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n    *   The resulting product is a diol (a molecule with two alcohol groups). For example, pyruvic acid (CH₃COCOOH) would be reduced to propane-1,2-diol (CH₃CH(OH)CH₂OH).\n    *   This final product, the diol, contains exactly **2 atoms of oxygen**. This confirms our identification of X as LiAlD₄.\n\n*   **Execution 4: Calculate the final answer**\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The constituent elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D, an isotope of Hydrogen).\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen (present as Deuterium, atomic number 1).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminum (atomic number 13).\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements. We will use integer masses for the calculation as is standard for this type of problem (D≈2, Al≈27).\n    *   Mass of the lightest element's atoms: There are 4 Deuterium atoms. Total mass = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Mass of the heaviest element's atoms: There is 1 Aluminum atom. Total mass = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Cumulative sum = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
