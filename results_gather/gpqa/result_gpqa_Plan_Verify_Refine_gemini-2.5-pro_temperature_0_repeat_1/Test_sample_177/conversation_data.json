    "Here is a plan to solve the problem:\n1.  Determine the mass dimension of the Lagrangian density, the fermion field $\\psi$, and the field strength tensor $F^{\\mu\\nu}$ in 4 spacetime dimensions.\n2.  Use the dimensions of the known fields and the Lagrangian to calculate the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\\kappa$.\n3.  Based on the mass dimension of $\\kappa$, determine if the theory is renormalizable.\n\n**Execution**\n\nIn natural units ($\\hbar=c=1$), the action $S = \\int d^4x \\, \\mathcal{L}$ is dimensionless.\n*   The spacetime volume element $d^4x$ has a mass dimension of $[d^4x]_M = -4$.\n*   For the action to be dimensionless, the Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}$ must have a mass dimension of $[\\mathcal{L}]_M = 4$.\n\nNow, let's find the mass dimensions of the fields from their kinetic terms:\n*   **Fermion field ($\\psi$):** The kinetic term is $\\mathcal{L}_{fermion} \\propto \\bar{\\psi}i\\gamma^\\mu\\partial_\\mu\\psi$.\n    *   We must have $[\\mathcal{L}_{fermion}]_M = 4$.\n    *   The derivative $\\partial_\\mu$ has a mass dimension of $[\\partial_\\mu]_M = 1$. The gamma matrices $\\gamma^\\mu$ are dimensionless.\n    *   So, $[\\bar{\\psi}]_M + [\\psi]_M + [\\partial_\\mu]_M = 4$. Since $[\\bar{\\psi}]_M = [\\psi]_M$, this gives $2[\\psi]_M + 1 = 4$, which means $[\\psi]_M = 3/2$.\n*   **Field strength tensor ($F^{\\mu\\nu}$):** The kinetic term for the gauge field is $\\mathcal{L}_{gauge} \\propto F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$.\n    *   We must have $[\\mathcal{L}_{gauge}]_M = 4$.\n    *   So, $[F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M + [F_{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 4$, which means $2[F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 4$, and thus $[F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 2$.\n*   The term $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}=\\frac{i}{2}\\left[\\gamma_{\\mu},\\gamma_{\\nu}\\right]$ is constructed from dimensionless gamma matrices, so it is also dimensionless: $[\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 0$.\n\nNow we can analyze the interaction term $\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}$. Its mass dimension must also be 4.\n*   $[\\mathcal{L}_{int}]_M = [\\kappa]_M + [\\bar{\\psi}]_M + [\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}]_M + [\\psi]_M + [F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 4$.\n*   Substituting the dimensions we found: $[\\kappa]_M + 3/2 + 0 + 3/2 + 2 = 4$.\n*   $[\\kappa]_M + 3 + 2 = 4$.\n*   $[\\kappa]_M + 5 = 4$.\n*   $[\\kappa]_M = -1$.\n\n**Renormalizability**\n\nThe renormalizability of a theory can be determined by the mass dimension of its coupling constants.\n*   If the coupling has a positive mass dimension, the theory is super-renormalizable.\n*   If the coupling is dimensionless, the theory is renormalizable.\n*   If the coupling has a negative mass dimension, the theory is non-renormalizable.\n\nSince $[\\kappa]_M = -1$, which is negative, the theory is non-renormalizable.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
