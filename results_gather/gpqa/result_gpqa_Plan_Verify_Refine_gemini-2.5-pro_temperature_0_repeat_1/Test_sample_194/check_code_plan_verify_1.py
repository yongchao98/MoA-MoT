    # --- Given Parameters from the question ---
    P1 = 3.0  # days, orbital period of planet 1
    b1 = 0.2  # unitless, impact parameter of planet 1
    Rp2_rearth = 2.5 # radius of planet 2 in Earth radii
    Rs_rsun = 1.5 # radius of the star in Sun radii

    # --- Physical Constants ---
    R_earth = 6371.0  # km
    R_sun = 696340.0  # km

    # --- LLM's Calculation (based on their flawed premise) ---
    # The LLM incorrectly used the grazing transit condition: a2_max * cos(i) = Rs + Rp2
    Rs = Rs_rsun * R_sun
    Rp2 = Rp2_rearth * R_earth
    Rp2_div_Rs = Rp2 / Rs
    # This is the ratio of semi-major axes according to the LLM's logic
    axis_ratio_llm = (1 + Rp2_div_Rs) / b1
    P2_max_llm = P1 * (axis_ratio_llm ** 1.5)

    # --- Correct Calculation ---
    # The question requires BOTH transit and occultation. The occultation condition
    # (projected separation <= Rs) is more restrictive than the transit condition
    # (projected separation <= Rs + Rp2). Therefore, the limiting case is the
    # grazing occultation.

    # From Planet 1, we establish the system's inclination geometry:
    # b1 = (a1 * cos(i)) / Rs  =>  a1 * cos(i) = b1 * Rs

    # For Planet 2, the maximum semi-major axis (a2_max) for a grazing occultation is:
    # a2_max * cos(i) = Rs

    # By taking the ratio of the two equations, we can find the ratio of the semi-major axes:
    # (a2_max * cos(i)) / (a1 * cos(i)) = Rs / (b1 * Rs)
    # a2_max / a1 = 1 / b1

    # Now, use Kepler's Third Law: (P2 / P1)^2 = (a2 / a1)^3
    # P2_max = P1 * (a2_max / a1)^(3/2)
    correct_axis_ratio = 1 / b1
    correct_P2_max = P1 * (correct_axis_ratio ** 1.5)

    # --- Verdict ---
    # The LLM's answer chose option C (~33.5 days).
    # The LLM's flawed calculation resulted in ~34.31 days.
    # The correct calculation results in ~33.54 days.
    
    # The LLM's reasoning is incorrect.

            "- Occultation limit: The projected separation of centers `d` must be `d <= Rs`.\n"
            "- Transit limit: The projected separation of centers `d` must be `d <= Rs + Rp2`.\n"
            "To satisfy both, the more restrictive occultation limit must be met. The provided answer incorrectly uses the transit limit (`Rs + Rp2`) for its calculation.\n\n"
            "Correct Calculation:\n"
            "1. From Planet 1: `a1 * cos(i) = b1 * Rs`\n"
            "2. For Planet 2 (grazing occultation): `a2_max * cos(i) = Rs`\n"
            "3. Ratio of semi-major axes: `a2_max / a1 = Rs / (b1 * Rs) = 1 / b1`\n"

            "Conclusion:\n"
            f"The correct maximum period is ~{correct_P2_max:.2f} days, which corresponds to option C (~33.5 days). The provided answer also selected option C, but its calculated value of ~{P2_max_llm:.2f} days was based on the incorrect physical condition. The final choice was correct only because the error introduced by including the planet's radius (`Rp2/Rs` term) was small."
