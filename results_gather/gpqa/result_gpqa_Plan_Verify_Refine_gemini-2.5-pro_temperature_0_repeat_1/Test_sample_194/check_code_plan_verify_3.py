    This function verifies the calculation for the maximum orbital period of a second planet

    # --- Given parameters from the question ---
    # Planet 1
    P1 = 3.0  # Orbital period in days
    b1 = 0.2  # Transit impact parameter

    # The radii of the star and planets are not required for this specific calculation,
    # as they cancel out when determining the ratio of the semi-major axes.

    # --- Theoretical Derivation ---
    # The impact parameter 'b' is defined as b = (a * cos(i)) / R_s, where 'a' is the semi-major axis,
    # 'i' is the orbital inclination, and 'R_s' is the stellar radius.
    # From Planet 1, we get the relationship for the system's inclination: a1 * cos(i) = b1 * R_s.

    # For Planet 2 to have both a transit and an occultation, the more restrictive geometric condition
    # must be met, which is for the occultation: the projected separation 'd2' must be less than or
    # equal to the stellar radius, R_s.
    # The maximum orbital period corresponds to the maximum semi-major axis (a2_max) that satisfies this.
    # This occurs at the limit, a grazing occultation, where d2 = R_s.
    # So, for Planet 2's limiting case: a2_max * cos(i) = R_s.

    # We can now find the ratio of the semi-major axes by dividing the two equations:
    # (a2_max * cos(i)) / (a1 * cos(i)) = R_s / (b1 * R_s)
    # This simplifies to: a2_max / a1 = 1 / b1.

    # According to Kepler's Third Law, (P2 / P1)^2 = (a2 / a1)^3.
    # We can solve for the maximum period of Planet 2 (P2_max):
    # P2_max = P1 * (a2_max / a1)^(3/2)
    # Substituting the ratio we found: P2_max = P1 * (1 / b1)^(1.5)

    # --- Calculation ---

        # Calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes
        axis_ratio = 1 / b1
        
        # Calculate the maximum period for Planet 2
        P2_max = P1 * (axis_ratio)**1.5
