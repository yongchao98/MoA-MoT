    # --- Step-by-step derivation and calculation ---

    # The problem asks for the maximum period of a second planet (P2) that exhibits
    # BOTH transit and occultation events. The planets share the same orbital plane,
    # so their orbital inclination 'i' relative to our line of sight is the same.

    # 1. Define the conditions for transit and occultation.
    #    - Transit: The planet passes in front of the star. The projected distance between
    #      the centers (d = a * cos(i), where 'a' is the semi-major axis) must be less
    #      than the sum of the radii (R_s + R_p). So, a * cos(i) < R_s + R_p.
    #    - Occultation: The planet passes behind the star. The projected distance 'd'
    #      must be less than the star's radius (R_s). So, a * cos(i) < R_s.

    # 2. Identify the limiting condition.
    #    The occultation condition (a * cos(i) < R_s) is more restrictive than the
    #    transit condition (a * cos(i) < R_s + R_p), since the planet's radius R_p is positive.
    #    Therefore, the maximum semi-major axis (and thus maximum period) is determined by
    #    the limiting case for an occultation, which is a "grazing occultation".
    #    For Planet 2, this means its maximum semi-major axis (a2_max) satisfies:
    #    a2_max * cos(i) = R_s  (Equation 1)

    # 3. Use data from Planet 1 to find a geometric property of the system.
    #    The impact parameter 'b' is the projected separation at mid-transit, in units of stellar radii.
    #    b1 = (a1 * cos(i)) / R_s
    #    Rearranging this gives:
    #    a1 * cos(i) = b1 * R_s  (Equation 2)

    # 4. Combine the equations to find the ratio of the semi-major axes.
    #    Divide Equation 1 by Equation 2:
    #    (a2_max * cos(i)) / (a1 * cos(i)) = R_s / (b1 * R_s)
    #    This simplifies to:
    #    a2_max / a1 = 1 / b1

    # 5. Apply Kepler's Third Law to find the period.
    #    For two planets orbiting the same star: (P2 / P1)^2 = (a2 / a1)^3
    #    Solving for the maximum period of Planet 2 (P2_max):
    #    P2_max = P1 * (a2_max / a1)^(3/2)
    #    Substituting the ratio from step 4:
    #    P2_max = P1 * (1 / b1)^(3/2)
