    "*   **Plan:**\n    1.  Deduce the molecular structure based on the provided information (di-substituted aromatic ring, 8 carbons, carbonyl, aromatic-halogen).\n    2.  Predict the key features of the 1H NMR spectrum for the deduced structure (number of signals, chemical shifts, integration, and splitting).\n    3.  Compare the predicted spectrum with the four options provided to identify the correct match.\n\n*   **Execution:**\n    1.  **Structure Deduction:**\n        *   A \"6-membered aromatic ring\" is a benzene ring (C6).\n        *   It is \"di-substituted,\" meaning two groups are attached to the C6H4 core.\n        *   There are \"8 carbon atoms in total.\" The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, so the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbons.\n        *   FTIR shows a \"carbonyl group\" (C=O) and an \"aromatic-halogen bond\" (a halogen attached to the ring).\n        *   To accommodate these features, one substituent must be the halogen (-X). The other substituent must contain the two carbons and the carbonyl group. The only stable arrangement is an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n        *   Therefore, the compound is a haloacetophenone.\n\n    2.  **NMR Prediction:**\n        *   The structure is X-C6H4-COCH3.\n        *   We expect a signal for the methyl group (-CH3) and signals for the four protons on the aromatic ring.\n        *   The methyl group is adjacent to a carbonyl group and not adjacent to any protons, so it will appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. Its typical chemical shift is around 2.0-2.5 ppm.\n        *   The four aromatic protons will be in the range of 7.0-8.0 ppm. The splitting pattern depends on the substitution (ortho, meta, para). A para-substituted (1,4) ring is highly symmetrical and typically shows two signals, each a **doublet (d)**, and each integrating to **2H**.\n\n    3.  **Comparison with Options:**\n        *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n            *   This spectrum shows two doublets in the aromatic region, each for 2H, which is characteristic of para-substitution.\n            *   It also shows a singlet for 3H at 2.3 ppm, which is characteristic of an acetyl methyl group.\n            *   This perfectly matches the predicted spectrum for a para-haloacetophenone.\n        *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n            *   There are no signals in the aromatic region (typically > 6.5 ppm). This is incorrect.\n        *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n            *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde, not the ketone present in our structure. This is incorrect.\n        *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n            *   The signals and splitting patterns are inconsistent with a di-substituted aromatic ring containing an acetyl group. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The only option that matches the deduced structure of a para-haloacetophenone is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
