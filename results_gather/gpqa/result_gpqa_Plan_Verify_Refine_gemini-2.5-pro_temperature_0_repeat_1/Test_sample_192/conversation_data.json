    "Excellent! The reasoning was confirmed to be correct.\n\nHere's a summary of the logical steps that led to the right answer:\n\n1.  **Goal:** Find the relationship for the number of stars per unit distance (`dN/dr`).\n2.  **Given Information:** The number of stars per unit parallax (`dN/d(plx)`) is proportional to `1/plx^5`.\n3.  **Key Relationship:** The distance `r` is inversely proportional to the parallax `plx`, so `r = 1/plx`. This also means `plx = 1/r`.\n4.  **Calculus Tool:** The chain rule connects the rates: `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`.\n5.  **Step-by-step Derivation:**\n    *   First, find the derivative `d(plx)/dr`. Since `plx = 1/r`, `d(plx)/dr = -1/r^2`.\n    *   Next, express the given `dN/d(plx)` in terms of `r`. Since `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5` and `plx = 1/r`, then `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/(1/r)^5 = r^5`.\n    *   Finally, substitute these parts into the chain rule. We only care about proportionality, so we can ignore the negative sign:\n        `dN/dr ∝ (r^5) * (1/r^2)`\n        `dN/dr ∝ r^3`\n\nThis result matches option C."

    "<information>### The Inverse Relationship Between Parallax and Astronomical Distance\n\nIn astronomy, parallax and distance share a fundamental and inverse relationship: the closer a celestial object is to Earth, the larger its parallax angle will be, and conversely, the farther away it is, the smaller its parallax angle. This principle is a cornerstone of astronomical distance measurement, particularly for nearby stars.\n\n#### Understanding Stellar Parallax\n\nStellar parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a nearby star against the backdrop of more distant stars when observed from two different points in Earth's orbit. To measure this, astronomers will chart a star's position and then observe it again six months later, when Earth has moved to the opposite side of the Sun. This creates a long baseline for observation, forming a triangle with the star at the apex. The parallax angle is defined as half of the total angle of this apparent shift.\n\nYou can observe this effect yourself by holding a thumb out at arm's length and closing one eye, then the other. Your thumb will appear to move against the more distant background. In this analogy, your eyes represent the two observation points of Earth, and your thumb is the nearby star.\n\n#### The Mathematical Formulation\n\nThe relationship between a star's distance and its parallax is expressed with a simple formula:\n\n**d = 1/p**\n\nIn this equation:\n*   **d** represents the distance to the star measured in **parsecs**.\n*   **p** is the parallax angle measured in **arcseconds**.\n\nAn arcsecond is a tiny unit of angular measurement, equal to 1/3600th of a degree. A parsec is a unit of distance defined as the distance at which a star would have a parallax of one arcsecond. One parsec is equivalent to approximately 3.26 light-years.\n\n#### A Foundational, Yet Limited, Tool\n\nThe parallax method is a direct and reliable way to measure the distances to stars and serves as a foundational step on the \"cosmic distance ladder,\" a series of techniques used to determine distances to progressively more remote objects. However, this method is most effective for stars that are relatively close.\n\nFor very distant celestial bodies, the parallax angle becomes exceedingly small and difficult to measure accurately from the ground due to the blurring effects of Earth's atmosphere. The development of space-based telescopes, such as the European Space Agency's Gaia mission, has significantly improved the precision of these measurements, allowing astronomers to determine the distances to a much larger number of stars with greater accuracy.</information>\nChecker feedback:\noutput: Correct"
