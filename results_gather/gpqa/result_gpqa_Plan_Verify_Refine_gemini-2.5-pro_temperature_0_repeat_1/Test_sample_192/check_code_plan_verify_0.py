    This function verifies the derivation for the number of stars per unit distance.

    The problem states:
    1. The number of stars per unit parallax, dN/d(plx), is proportional to 1/plx^5.
    2. The relationship between distance (r) and parallax (plx) is r = 1/plx.

    The goal is to find the proportionality for the number of stars per unit distance, dN/dr.

    We use the chain rule: dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr).
