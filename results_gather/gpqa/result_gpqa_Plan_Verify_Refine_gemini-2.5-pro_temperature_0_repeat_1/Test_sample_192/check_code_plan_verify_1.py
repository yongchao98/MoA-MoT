    This function uses symbolic mathematics to verify the relationship between
    the number of stars per unit distance (dN/dr) and distance (r),
    given the relationship with parallax (plx).

    The derivation follows these steps:
    1. Define the symbols r (distance) and plx (parallax).
    2. State the physical relationship: plx = 1/r.
    3. State the given information: dN/d(plx) is proportional to 1/plx^5.
    4. Use the chain rule: dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr).
    5. Calculate each part of the chain rule and combine them.
    6. Check if the final expression for dN/dr is proportional to r^3.
