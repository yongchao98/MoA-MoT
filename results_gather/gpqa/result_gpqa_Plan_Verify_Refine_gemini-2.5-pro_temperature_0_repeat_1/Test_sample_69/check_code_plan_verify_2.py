    """
    Checks the correctness of the likely intended answer to the chemistry riddle.

    The riddle is known to have several inconsistencies. This function checks the
    solution path where E = Phosgene (COCl2), which has C2v symmetry (Option D),
    and reports which constraints from the question are violated.

    The provided LLM response did not give a final answer, so this code checks
    the standard answer to the riddle instead.

    # The intended solution path for this classic riddle:
    # A = I2 (Iodine)
    # B = Cl2 (Chlorine)
    # C = I2Cl6 (dimer of Iodine trichloride)
    # D = CO (Carbon monoxide)
    # E = COCl2 (Phosgene)
    # F = HCl (Hydrochloric acid)
    # G = HIO3 (Iodic acid)
    # H = COCl2 (Phosgene)
    # The question asks for the symmetry of E, which is C2v.

    errors.append("Constraint Violated (Reaction 1): Product C (I2Cl6) is bright yellow, not bright red as stated.")

    # --- Constraint 2: When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E. ---
    # Fact: The reaction is I2Cl6 + 2CO -> 2ICl + 2COCl2.
    # Check product: The reaction produces two products (ICl and COCl2), not a single product E.

    # Check hazard: E (COCl2, phosgene) is indeed extremely hazardous. (This part is satisfied).

    # --- Constraint 3: C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid. ---
    # Fact: 5ICl3 + 9H2O -> I2 + 3HIO3 + 15HCl.
    # Check products: The products are A=I2 (reformed), G=HIO3 (weak acid), and F=HCl (strong acid).
    # This constraint is fully satisfied by the proposed solution.

    # --- Constraint 4: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. ---
    # Fact: CO(g) + Cl2(g) -> COCl2(l/g).
    # Check ratio: The reaction is 1:1. (This part is satisfied).
