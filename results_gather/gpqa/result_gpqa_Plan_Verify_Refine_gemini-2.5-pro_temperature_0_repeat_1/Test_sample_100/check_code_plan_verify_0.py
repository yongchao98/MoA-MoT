    # --- Chemical Logic Verification ---

    # 1. Deduce the required carbonyl compound (Reagent A) from the product.
    # The reaction is an enamine synthesis from 3-methylpyrrolidine (a secondary amine)
    # and a carbonyl compound.
    # The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine.
    # The substituent on the nitrogen, "cyclohexylidenemethyl" [-CH=C(cyclohexane)],
    # must originate from the carbonyl compound.
    # Through retrosynthesis of the enamine, the carbonyl compound must be O=CH-(cyclohexane).
    required_reagent_A = "cyclohexanecarbaldehyde"

    # 2. Evaluate the suitability of the catalyst (Reagent B).
    # Enamine formation is an acid-catalyzed dehydration, often driven by heat.
    # TsOH (p-Toluenesulfonic acid) is a strong acid and a standard, highly effective catalyst for this reaction.
    # Acetic acid is a weak acid and is less effective than TsOH.
    # Therefore, TsOH is the more suitable catalyst.
    most_suitable_catalyst_B = "TsOH"
