    # Scientific Rationale:
    # 1. PFA is a standard, short-range crosslinker.
    # 2. PFA+DSG is a stronger, dual-crosslinking method that stabilizes large protein complexes.
    # 3. A known artifact of strong crosslinking is "epitope masking," where the antibody's target
    #    is obscured by the dense network of crosslinked proteins.
    # 4. This masking effect is most pronounced where the target protein (IKAROS) is part of the
    #    largest, most stable multi-protein complexes.
    # 5. As a key transcription factor, IKAROS forms these large complexes at its primary
    #    functional sites: active promoters and enhancers.
    # 6. Therefore, peaks at these locations are the most likely to disappear due to epitope masking
    #    when switching from PFA to the stronger PFA+DSG.
