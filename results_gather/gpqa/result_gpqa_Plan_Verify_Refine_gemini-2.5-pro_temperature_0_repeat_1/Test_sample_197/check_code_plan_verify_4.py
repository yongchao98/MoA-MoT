    # Total cobalt concentration c(Co) = 10^-2 M (This is not needed for the percentage calculation)
    # Ligand concentration [SCN-]
    L = 0.1  # M

    # Stability constants

    # --- Calculation ---
    # The mole fraction of a specific complex, α_n, is given by the formula:
    # α_n = (β_n * [L]^n) / (1 + Σ(β_i * [L]^i)) for i=1 to N
    # We need to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, which is [Co(SCN)2].
    # This corresponds to n=2.

    # Numerator for the α_2 term
    numerator = beta2 * (L**2)

    # Denominator is the sum of terms for all species (from Co^2+ to [Co(SCN)4]^2-)
    # The term for the free metal ion Co^2+ is 1 (since β_0 is defined as 1).
    denominator = 1 + (beta1 * L**1) + (beta2 * L**2) + (beta3 * L**3) + (beta4 * L**4)

    # Calculate the mole fraction α_2
    alpha2 = numerator / denominator

    # Convert the mole fraction to a percentage
    calculated_percentage = alpha2 * 100

    # --- Verification ---
    # Check if the calculated percentage is close to the expected percentage from option C.
    # We use a small tolerance to account for potential floating-point inaccuracies.
    tolerance = 0.1  # A tolerance of 0.1% is reasonable for this kind of problem.
