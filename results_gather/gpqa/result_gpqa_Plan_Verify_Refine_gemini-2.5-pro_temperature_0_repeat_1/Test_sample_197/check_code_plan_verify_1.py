    # The percentage of a specific complex [Co(SCN)n] is given by its mole fraction α_n * 100.
    # The formula for the mole fraction of the dithiocyanato complex ([Co(SCN)2]), α₂, is:
    # α₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)
    # where the denominator represents the sum of the relative concentrations of all
    # cobalt-containing species: [Co²⁺], [Co(SCN)]⁺, [Co(SCN)₂], [Co(SCN)₃]⁻, and [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻.

    # Calculate the numerator (the term for the target species [Co(SCN)2])
    numerator = beta2 * (L**2)

    # Calculate the denominator (the sum of terms for all species)
    denominator = 1 + (beta1 * L) + (beta2 * L**2) + (beta3 * L**3) + (beta4 * L**4)

    # --- Verification ---
    # Check if the calculated percentage is close to the percentage of the chosen option.
    # We use math.isclose() to handle potential floating-point inaccuracies.
    # A relative tolerance of 1% (rel_tol=0.01) is sufficient for this kind of problem.
