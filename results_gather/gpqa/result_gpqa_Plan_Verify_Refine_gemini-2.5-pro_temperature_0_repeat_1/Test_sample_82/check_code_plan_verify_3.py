    # --- Step 2: Calculate pH at 25% titration ---
    # At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized to form its conjugate base, acetate (A-).
    # This creates a buffer solution where the ratio of [A-]/[HA] is 0.25 / (1 - 0.25) = 0.25 / 0.75 = 1/3.

    # Concentration of the acetate ion (A-) at the equivalence point
    M_A_minus_at_eq = moles_A_minus_at_eq / V_total_eq_L

    # The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water: A- + H2O <=> HA + OH-
    # We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate.
    Kb = Kw / Ka
    
    # We can set up an ICE table for the hydrolysis, which gives Kb = [OH-]^2 / [A-].
