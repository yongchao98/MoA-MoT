    moles_A_minus = initial_moles_HA
    C_A_minus_eq = moles_A_minus / V_total_eq_L

    # The conjugate base A- hydrolyzes in water: A- + H2O <=> HA + OH-
    # We need the base dissociation constant, Kb.
    Kb = Kw / Ka

    # Use the equilibrium expression for the base: Kb = [HA][OH-]/[A-]
    # Let x = [OH-]. Then Kb = x^2 / (C_A_minus_eq - x).
    # Since Kb is small, we can approximate C_A_minus_eq - x ≈ C_A_minus_eq.
    # So, Kb ≈ x^2 / C_A_minus_eq
