            f"2. Constraint Check (Stereochemistry): The major product is the 'endo' adduct, where the anhydride ring is on the same side as the C7 bridge (the CH2 group from the original diene).\n"
            f"3. Constraint Check (NOESY): A unique NOESY cross-peak in the major product arises from a spatial proximity that is absent in the minor ('exo') product. This key proximity in the 'endo' adduct is between the anhydride protons and one of the C7 bridge protons.\n"
            f"4. Signal Assignment: The anhydride protons are the '2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm', and a C7 bridge proton is the '1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm'.\n"
            f"5. Conclusion: The cross-peak must connect these two signals. This corresponds to answer choice '{deduced_correct_choice}', not '{provided_answer_choice}'."
