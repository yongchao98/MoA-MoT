    """
    This function calculates the non-Gaussianity (nG) of the specified
    Schrödinger cat state and checks the correctness of the LLM's answer.

    The function follows these steps:
    1. Defines the state parameters.
    2. Acknowledges that for a pure state rho, S(rho) = 0.
    3. Assumes the standard definition of nG = S(tau) - S(rho) = S(tau).
    4. Calculates the first (d) and second (n, m) moments of the state rho.
    5. Determines the entropy S(tau) of the corresponding reference Gaussian state,
       which is a squeezed thermal state because the moment m=<a^2> is non-zero.
    6. Compares the calculated nG with the LLM's answer (Option D).

    # The state is |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>) / N.
    # For phi = -pi/4, this is proportional to the odd cat state |alpha> - |-alpha>.
    # The density matrix is rho = |psi><psi|. Since this is a pure state, its
    # von Neumann entropy S(rho) = -Tr(rho * log(rho)) is exactly 0.

    # The non-Gaussianity (nG) is defined as the relative entropy between rho and
    # a reference Gaussian state tau. The standard definition is nG = S(tau) - S(rho).
    # Since S(rho) = 0, the non-Gaussianity is simply the entropy of the reference
    # Gaussian state, nG = S(tau).

    # The reference state tau must match the first and second moments of rho.
    
    # 1. Calculate moments of the state rho.
    # Displacement d = <a> = 0 for this state.
    # Squeezing parameter m = <a^2> = alpha^2 for this state.
    m = alpha**2

    # Mean photon number n = <a†a>. The analytical formula is n = alpha^2 * coth(alpha^2).
    # coth(x) = cosh(x) / sinh(x)
    n = alpha**2 * (np.cosh(alpha**2) / np.sinh(alpha**2))

    # 2. Calculate the covariance matrix gamma of rho.
    # Since d=0, the elements are determined by n and m.
    # <q^2> = 0.5 * (m + m.conj() + 2*n + 1)
    # <p^2> = 0.5 * (-m - m.conj() + 2*n + 1)

    # A simpler formula is det(gamma) = (n + 0.5)**2 - m**2
    det_gamma = (n + 0.5)**2 - m**2

    # 3. Calculate the entropy of the reference state tau.
    # The entropy of a single-mode Gaussian state is S(tau) = g(nu), where
    # nu = sqrt(det(gamma)) - 0.5
    # g(x) = (x+1)log(x+1) - xlog(x)
