    This function calculates the non-Gaussianity (nG) of a specific Schrödinger cat state
    and checks if the provided answer from an LLM is correct.

    The state is |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>) / N
    with alpha = 0.5 and phi = -pi/4.

    The non-Gaussianity is measured by the relative entropy between the state's density
    matrix (rho) and a reference Gaussian state (tau) with the same first and second moments.
    nG = S(tau) - S(rho)

    Since |psi> is a pure state, its von Neumann entropy S(rho) is 0.
    Therefore, nG = S(tau).
