    "*   **Plan:**\n    1.  Deduce the structural fragments of the unknown compound from the provided FTIR and 1H NMR data.\n    2.  Assemble these fragments into a complete, plausible chemical structure that satisfies all the given constraints (di-substituted aromatic, ester, specific NMR signals, no –CH2– groups).\n    3.  Calculate the molecular formula of the deduced structure and match it with the given options.\n\n*   **Action (Execution of Plan):**\n\n    1.  **Analyze the Spectroscopic Data:**\n        *   **FTIR:** An ester group (–COO–) is present. This accounts for the two oxygen atoms in all the formula options.\n        *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This implies a C6H4 core. The presence of only two aromatic-H signals strongly suggests a para (1,4) substitution pattern. This fragment is C6H4.\n        *   **Vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH3). The proton coupled to both another vinyl proton and a methyl group gives the doublet of quartets. This fragment is C3H5.\n        *   **Two –CH3 signals:** One methyl signal comes from the propenyl group (–CH=CH–**CH3**). The second methyl signal must belong to the ester group.\n        *   **No –CH2– signals:** This is a critical constraint. It means the ester cannot be an ethyl ester (–COOCH2CH3) or a propanoate (–CH2COO–), for example.\n\n    2.  **Assemble the Structure:**\n        *   We have a para-substituted benzene ring (C6H4).\n        *   One substituent is the propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH3).\n        *   The other substituent must be an ester containing a methyl group, with no methylene (–CH2–) groups. This leaves two possibilities for this substituent:\n            *   An acetate group: –O–CO–CH3\n            *   A methoxycarbonyl group (methyl ester): –COO–CH3\n\n    3.  **Determine the Molecular Formula:**\n        *   **Possibility 1:** The molecule is 4-propenylphenyl acetate.\n            *   Fragments: C6H4 (ring) + C3H5 (propenyl) + C2H3O2 (acetate group)\n            *   Total Carbons: 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n            *   Total Hydrogens: 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n            *   Total Oxygens: 2\n            *   Formula: **C11H12O2**\n\n        *   **Possibility 2:** The molecule is methyl 4-propenylbenzoate.\n            *   Fragments: C6H4 (ring) + C3H5 (propenyl) + C2H3O2 (methoxycarbonyl group)\n            *   Total Carbons: 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n            *   Total Hydrogens: 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n            *   Total Oxygens: 2\n            *   Formula: **C11H12O2**\n\n    Both plausible structures that fit all the spectroscopic data have the same molecular formula: C11H12O2. This formula corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
