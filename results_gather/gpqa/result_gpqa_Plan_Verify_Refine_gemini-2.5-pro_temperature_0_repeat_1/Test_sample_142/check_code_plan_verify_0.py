    # Step 1.1: Identify the two carbons bearing hydroxyl groups in proposed A.
    # C_alpha: Carbon attached to two p-tolyl groups and one OH. It's tertiary and di-benzylic.
    # C1_ring: Carbon in the cyclopentane ring attached to one OH. It's tertiary.
    
    # Step 1.2: Determine which OH group leaves by forming the most stable carbocation.
    # Stability: tertiary di-benzylic >> tertiary.
    # Therefore, the OH on C_alpha leaves.

    # Step 1.3: Determine the migrating group from the adjacent carbon (C1_ring).
    # The groups on C1_ring are part of the cyclopentane ring structure.
    # Migration of a C-C bond from the ring to C_alpha will lead to ring expansion.
    # This is highly favorable as it relieves ring strain (5-membered -> 6-membered).

    if migration_type != "ring_expansion":
        return "Incorrect logic for Reaction 1: The most favorable migration is the expansion of the 5-membered ring to a 6-membered ring."

    # Step 1.4: Determine the final product structure.
    # - The 5-membered ring becomes a 6-membered ring.
    # - The original C_alpha becomes a ring carbon, bonded to two p-tolyl groups.
    # - The original C1_ring is now adjacent to it, bears the remaining OH, and becomes a ketone after rearrangement.

    # Step 2.1: Identify the two carbons bearing hydroxyl groups in the starting material.

    # Step 2.3: Determine the migrating group from the adjacent carbon (C3).
    # Groups on C3: a Hydrogen (H) and a Methyl group (CH3).

    # Therefore, the Hydrogen atom migrates (1,2-hydride shift).

    # Step 2.4: Determine the final product structure.
    # - H moves from C3 to C2.
    # - Positive charge moves to C3, which has the remaining OH group.
    # - Rearrangement and deprotonation form a ketone at C3.
