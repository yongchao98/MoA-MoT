    "An oscillating spheroid charge distribution along its symmetry axis (z-axis) can be modeled as an oscillating electric dipole. The physics of electric dipole radiation governs the properties of the emitted electromagnetic waves.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Identify the formula for the power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) from an oscillating electric dipole, focusing on its dependence on the angle `θ`.\n2.  Use the angular dependence to calculate the ratio of the power at `θ = 30°` to the maximum power `A`.\n3.

    "An oscillating spheroid charge distribution along its symmetry axis (the z-axis) can be modeled as an oscillating electric dipole. The radiated power from such a dipole is described by the Larmor formula.\n\n1.  **Angular Dependence:** The power radiated per unit solid angle, `dP/dΩ`, is given by:\n    `dP/dΩ = (p₀² ω⁴) / (32π²ε₀c³) * sin²(θ)`\n    where `p₀` is the amplitude of the dipole moment, `ω` is the angular frequency, `c` is the speed of light, `ε₀` is the permittivity of free space, and `θ` is the angle with the axis of oscillation (the z-axis).\n\n    The function `f` in the problem is this power per unit solid angle: `f(λ, θ) ∝ sin²(θ)`.\n\n    The maximum power, `A`, is radiated when `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin²(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°`.\n    `A ∝ sin²(90°) = 1`\n\n    We need to find the power radiated at `θ = 30°` as a fraction of `A`.\n    Power at 30° `∝ sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n\n    The fraction of the maximum power is:\n    Fraction = (Power at 30°) / (Maximum Power A) = `(sin²(30°)) / (sin²(90°)) = (1/4) / 1 = 1/4`.\n\n2.  **Wavelength Dependence:** From the formula above, the power `f` is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency `ω`:\n    `f ∝ ω⁴`\n\n    The relationship between angular frequency `ω` and wavelength `λ` is `ω = 2πc/λ`. Substituting this into the proportionality:\n    `f ∝ (2πc/λ)⁴ ∝ 1/λ⁴ = λ⁻⁴`\n\n    Therefore, a possible form for `f` includes a `λ⁻⁴` dependence.\n\nCombining the two results, the fraction is **1/4** and the functional form is **λ⁻⁴**.
