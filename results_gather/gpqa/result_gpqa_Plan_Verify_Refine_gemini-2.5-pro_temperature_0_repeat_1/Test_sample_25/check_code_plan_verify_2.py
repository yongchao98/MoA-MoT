    # The reaction is Cyclohexene + A ---> 8,8-diiodobicyclo[4.2.0]octan-7-one.
    # This is a [2+2] cycloaddition. The product's structure indicates that a 4-membered
    # ring containing a ketone (C=O) and a di-iodinated carbon (CI2) is fused to the
    # cyclohexene ring. This requires reactant A to be a ketene with the structure I2C=C=O.
