    # --- Problem Data & Provided Answer ---
    # The nucleus is Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. Atomic number of Li is 3.
    # Therefore, the nucleus is Li-6 (3 protons, 3 neutrons).
    # The speed is v = 0.96c.
    v_over_c = 0.96
    # The provided answer to check is from option D.

    # --- Calculation using Physically Correct Method ---
    # 1. Calculate the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus by subtracting the mass
    #    of the 3 electrons from the neutral atomic mass.
    mass_nucleus_amu = atomic_mass_li6_amu - (3 * mass_electron_amu)

    # 2. Convert the nuclear rest mass to rest energy (E_rest = m_rest * c^2).

    # 3. Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma) for the given speed.
    #    gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)
    gamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v_over_c**2)

    # 4. Calculate the total relativistic energy (E_total = gamma * E_rest).
