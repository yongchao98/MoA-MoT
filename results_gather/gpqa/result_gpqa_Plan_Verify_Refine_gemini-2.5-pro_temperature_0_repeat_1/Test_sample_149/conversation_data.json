    "My plan is to first deduce the structure of the starting material using the provided molecular formula and NMR data. Then, I will trace this structure through the three-step reaction sequence to determine the final product and match it to the given options.\n\n1.  **Plan:**\n    *   Analyze the molecular formula (C8H9NO) and 1H-NMR data to determine the structure of the initial reactant.\n    *   Follow the reactant through the three-step chemical transformation: 1) Diazotization, 2) Hydrolysis, 3) Aldol condensation.\n    *   Identify the final product and select the corresponding option.\n\n2.  **Execution:**\n    *   **Step 1: Identify the Starting Material**\n        *   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO. The degree of unsaturation is (2*8 + 2 - 9 - 1)/2 = 4. This suggests the presence of a benzene ring.\n        *   **1H-NMR Analysis:**\n            *   `9.72 (t, 1H)`: This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet splitting indicates it is coupled to an adjacent methylene (-CH2-) group.\n            *   `3.66 (d, 2H)`: This signal corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-). The doublet splitting indicates it is coupled to a single proton, which is the aldehyde proton. The combination of these two signals confirms a `-CH2-CHO` fragment.\n            *   `6.98 (d, 2H)` and `6.51 (d, 2H)`: These two doublets in the aromatic region are classic indicators of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n            *   `6.27 (bs, 2H)`: A broad singlet for two protons is characteristic of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n        *   **Structure Assembly:** Combining the fragments—a para-substituted ring, an -NH2 group, and a -CH2CHO group—leads to the structure **2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde**. This structure is consistent with the molecular formula C8H9NO.\n\n    *   **Step 2: Analyze the Reaction Sequence**\n        *   The starting material is 2-(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde.\n        *   **Reagents 1 & 2 (NaNO2 + HCl, then H2O):** This is a two-step process to convert a primary aromatic amine into a phenol. The amine is first converted to a diazonium salt, which is then hydrolyzed by water to an alcohol (a phenol in this case).\n            *   Product after step 2: **2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde**.\n        *   **Reagent 3 (aq. KOH, Heat):** These are the conditions for a base-catalyzed aldol condensation. The aldehyde, 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde, has acidic alpha-protons (on the -CH2- group) and will react with itself.\n            1.  **Aldol Addition:** One molecule forms an enolate, which attacks the carbonyl group of a second molecule. This forms an aldol addition product: `3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal` (This corresponds to option D).\n            2.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The \"Heat\" in the reaction conditions promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. The acidic proton on the α-carbon (C2) and the hydroxyl group on the β-carbon (C3) are removed, forming a stable α,β-unsaturated double bond.\n            *   Final Product: **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n    *   **Step 3: Match with Options**\n        *   The final product, 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal, matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
