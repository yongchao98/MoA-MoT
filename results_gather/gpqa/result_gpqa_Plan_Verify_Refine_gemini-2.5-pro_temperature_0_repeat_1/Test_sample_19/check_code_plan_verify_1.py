    # The question asks for the assumptions that jointly imply the "impulse" approximation.
    # Based on the principles of nuclear physics:
    # 1. "The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons." - This is a core tenet. The total interaction is the sum of single-nucleon interactions. CORRECT.
    # 2. "The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon." - This means negligible Final State Interactions (FSI), which is a necessary condition for the approximation to be valid. CORRECT.
    # 3. "The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic." - This is about the internal structure of the nucleon, not about the interaction of the nucleon within the nucleus. The impulse approximation treats the nucleon as the fundamental particle for the interaction. INCORRECT assumption for this context.
    # 4. "The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces." - This is the "free nucleon" part of the approximation. The binding potential is ignored during the brief interaction. CORRECT.
