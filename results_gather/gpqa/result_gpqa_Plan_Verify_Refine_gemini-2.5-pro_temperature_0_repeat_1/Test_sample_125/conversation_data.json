    "Here is a thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **Goal:** Determine the number of peaks in two different HPLC analyses (normal-phase and chiral) of a combined product mixture.\n    *   **Source of products:** Two separate chemical reactions.\n    *   **Reaction I:** Reduction of a chiral ketone, (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, with LAH.\n    *   **Reaction II:** Reduction of an achiral diketone, pentane-2,4-dione, with NaBH4.\n    *   **Analysis I:** Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds by polarity. It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but *not* enantiomers.\n    *   **Analysis II:** Chiral HPLC separates compounds based on their interaction with a chiral stationary phase. It can separate constitutional isomers, diastereomers, *and* enantiomers.\n\n2.  **Plan the Analysis:**\n    *   **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I.** Determine the structure and stereochemistry of the product(s).\n    *   **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II.** Determine the structure and stereochemistry of the product(s).\n    *   **Step 3: Combine the products.** List all unique molecules formed.\n    *   **Step 4: Predict the number of peaks for Normal-Phase HPLC.** Group enantiomers together, but separate diastereomers and constitutional isomers.\n    *   **Step 5: Predict the number of peaks for Chiral HPLC.** Count every unique stereoisomer.\n    *   **Step 6: Match the results to the given options.**\n\n3.  **Execute the Plan:**\n\n    *   **Action 1: Analyze Reaction I.**\n        *   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a ketone with one existing stereocenter at carbon 5.\n        *   **Reagent:** LAH (Lithium aluminum hydride) is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone (C=O) at carbon 3 to an alcohol (CH-OH).\n        *   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The reduction of the planar carbonyl group creates a *new* stereocenter at carbon 3. The original stereocenter at carbon 5 is unaffected. The hydride can attack from two different faces, creating both (R) and (S) configurations at the new center.\n        *   **Products of Reaction I:**\n            *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n            *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        *   **Relationship:** These two products have the same connectivity but different stereochemistry at one center (C3) while the other is the same (C5). They are **diastereomers**.\n        *   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Produces 2 diastereomeric compounds.\n\n    *   **Action 2: Analyze Reaction II.**\n        *   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is a symmetric, achiral diketone.\n        *   **Reagent:** Excess NaBH4 will reduce both ketone groups to alcohols, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n        *   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The reaction creates two new stereocenters at carbons 2 and 4. We must consider all possible combinations: (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n        *   **Products of Reaction II:**\n            *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. These are non-superimposable mirror images, so they are an **enantiomeric pair**.\n            *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry between C2 and C4. It is a **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration is the same molecule, just flipped over.\n        *   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Produces 3 stereoisomers in total: one pair of enantiomers and one meso compound.\n\n    *   **Action 3: Predict Normal-Phase HPLC Peaks.**\n        *   Normal-phase HPLC separates based on polarity. Enantiomers have identical polarities and co-elute (give one peak). Diastereomers and constitutional isomers have different polarities and separate.\n        *   **From Reaction I:** The two products are diastereomers. They will separate. -> **2 peaks**.\n        *   **From Reaction II:** The enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) will co-elute. -> **1 peak**. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will elute separately. -> **1 peak**.\n        *   **Total Normal-Phase Peaks:** The products from Reaction I are constitutionally different from the products of Reaction II, so they will all be distinct. Total peaks = 2 (from I) + 1 (enantiomers from II) + 1 (meso from II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n    *   **Action 4: Predict Chiral HPLC Peaks.**\n        *   Chiral HPLC separates all stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n        *   **From Reaction I:** The two diastereomers will separate. -> **2 peaks**.\n        *   **From Reaction II:** The enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) will be resolved into two separate peaks. -> **2 peaks**. The meso compound is achiral but is a distinct molecule from the others, so it will give its own peak. -> **1 peak**.\n        *   **Total Chiral HPLC Peaks:** Total peaks = 2 (from I) + 2 (enantiomers from II) + 1 (meso from II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n    *   **Action 5: Final Conclusion.**\n        *   The analysis predicts 5 peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.\n        *   This corresponds to option D.\n\nThe plan is complete and the logic is sound. I am confident in the result.\n\n<<<D>>>"
