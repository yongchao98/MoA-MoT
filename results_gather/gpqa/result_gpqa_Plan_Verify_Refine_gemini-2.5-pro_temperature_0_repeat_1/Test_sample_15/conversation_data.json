    "To determine how many of the compounds are optically active, we need to assess each one for chirality. A molecule is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This typically occurs when a molecule has a chiral center and lacks any internal elements of symmetry (like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion).\n\nHere is the step-by-step analysis of each compound:\n\n1.  ***(Z)***-**1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   Structure: `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`\n    *   This molecule has a double bond. There are no chiral centers (carbon atoms bonded to four different groups). The molecule itself is planar around the double bond and possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule).\n    *   **Conclusion**: Achiral and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  ***(3aR,7aS,E)***-**8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   The name itself provides stereochemical descriptors (`R` and `S`), which indicate the presence of chiral centers with a specific configuration.\n    *   The designation `(3aR,7aS)` specifies a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule. A single enantiomer is, by definition, optically active. The molecule is a complex bridged system and lacks internal symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Chiral and therefore **optically active**.\n\n3.  ***(2R,3S)***-**2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   Structure: `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`\n    *   This molecule has two chiral centers (C2 and C3). However, the molecule is symmetric, as the groups attached to C2 are the same as those attached to C3.\n    *   The `(2R,3S)` configuration results in a molecule with a plane of symmetry (in the eclipsed conformation) or a center of inversion (in the anti-periplanar conformation). This is a **meso compound**.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Achiral (meso) and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  ***(2R,3R)***-**2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The `(2R,3R)` configuration lacks any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` compound, and they are not superimposable. This is a chiral molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Chiral and therefore **optically active**.\n\n5.  ***(R)***-**cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   Structure: A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an -OH group at C1.\n    *   The carbon at position 1 (C1) is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, -CH=CH- (part of the ring), and -CH2-CH2- (part of the ring). Thus, C1 is a chiral center.\n    *   The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Chiral and therefore **optically active**.\n\n6.  ***(1s,3s,5s)***-**cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This is the isomer where all three hydroxyl (-OH) groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all-cis).\n    *   This molecule possesses a high degree of symmetry. It has a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and three vertical planes of symmetry (Ïƒv). Each plane of symmetry passes through one C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Achiral and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   Structure: `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl` which can be written as `(CH3)2CH-CH2-CO-Cyclopentyl`.\n    *   Let's check for chiral centers. The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to a hydrogen, a `CH2-CO-Cyclopentyl` group, and two identical methyl (`CH3`) groups. Since it is bonded to two identical groups, it is not a chiral center.\n    *   There are no other chiral centers in the molecule. The molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Achiral and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Optically active: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione, (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol.\n*   Optically inactive: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol, 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one.\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<A>>>"
