    "The problem of radioactive decay is governed by an exponential distribution, which is a memoryless process. This means the probability of the atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already survived. Therefore, the fact that 50 minutes have passed without decay is irrelevant to the future probability. We only need to calculate the probability of decay in a 150-minute interval.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the decay constant (λ)**\n\nThe probability of an atom *not* decaying (surviving) over a time `t` is given by `P(survival) = e^(-λt)`.\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\nThis means the probability of survival for 100 minutes is `1 - 0.32 = 0.68`.\n\nSo, we have the equation:\n`0.68 = e^(-λ * 100)`\n\nTo solve for λ, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(0.68) = -100λ`\n`λ = -ln(0.68) / 100`\n`λ ≈ 0.003857 min⁻¹`\n\nThis was confirmed by the first Python script.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes**\n\nNow we use the calculated decay constant `λ` to find the probability of decay in a new time interval, `t = 150` minutes.\n\nThe probability of decay is `P(decay) = 1 - P(survival) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n`P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - e^(-0.003857 * 150)`\n`P(decay in 150 min) ≈ 1 - e^(-0.57855)`\n`P(decay in 150 min) ≈ 1 - 0.5607`\n`P(decay in 150 min) ≈ 0.4393`\n\nThis calculation was confirmed by the second Python script, which gave a result of 0.4393 or 43.93%.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe probability of the atom decaying in the next 150 minutes is approximately 43.93%, which rounds to 44%.\n\n<<<A>>>"
