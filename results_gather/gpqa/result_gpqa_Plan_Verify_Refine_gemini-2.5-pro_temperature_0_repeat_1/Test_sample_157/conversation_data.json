    "This is a conceptual question that can be solved by reasoning through the definitions of the genetic terms provided.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Define the key terms: \"dominant-negative mutation\" and \"dimerization domain\".\n2.  Hypothesize the molecular interaction between the wild-type protein and the mutant protein (Y) in a heterozygous individual.\n3.  Evaluate the given options based on this hypothesized interaction to find the most likely molecular phenotype.\n\n**Execution of Plan:**\n\n1.  **Definitions:**\n    *   **Dimerization Domain:** The part of a protein responsible for binding to another identical or similar protein to form a functional pair (a dimer).\n    *   **Dominant-Negative Mutation:** A mutation where the altered gene product not only loses its own function but also interferes with the function of the normal protein produced from the wild-type allele. This is common for proteins that function as dimers or multimers.\n\n2.  **Hypothesized Interaction:**\n    *   In a heterozygote, the cell produces both wild-type (WT) protein and mutant (Y) protein.\n    *   The mutation is in the dimerization domain. This means the Y protein can likely still interact with the WT protein to form a dimer, but the resulting WT-Y heterodimer will be non-functional.\n    *   The Y protein acts by \"poisoning\" the WT protein, sequestering it into these non-functional complexes. This prevents the WT protein from forming functional WT-WT homodimers.\n    *   The result is a significant reduction in the overall functional protein activity, leading to a loss-of-function phenotype even though a good copy of the gene exists.\n\n3.  **Evaluation of Options:**\n    *   **A) protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele:** While a loss-of-function occurs, the mechanism isn't necessarily protein degradation. For the mutant protein to interfere with the wild-type, it must be stable enough to bind to it. If it were simply degraded, it couldn't exert a dominant-negative effect.\n    *   **B) loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype:** A dominant-negative mutation results in a mutant phenotype, not a wild-type one. This is incorrect.\n    *   **C) protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype:** This is the most likely scenario. The mutant protein binds to (or \"aggregates\" with) the wild-type protein, forming non-functional dimers. This sequestration of the wild-type protein into useless complexes is the classic mechanism for a dominant-negative effect, leading to an overall loss-of-function phenotype.\n    *   **D) change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype:** The problem explicitly states it is a dominant-*negative* mutation, which is a type of loss-of-function, not a gain-of-function.\n\nThe most accurate description of the molecular events is the formation of non-functional complexes that sequester the wild-type protein, which can be described as a form of aggregation, leading to a loss-of-function phenotype.\n\n<<<C>>>"
