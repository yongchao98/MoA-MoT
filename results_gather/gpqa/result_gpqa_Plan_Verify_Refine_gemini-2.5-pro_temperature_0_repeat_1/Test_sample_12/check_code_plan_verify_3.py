    This function programmatically checks the correctness of the provided answer
    by verifying the chemical logic at each step of the synthesis.

    The synthesis steps are:
    1. (R)-Limonene + 1 eq H2/PdC -> Product 1
    2. Product 1 + m-CPBA -> Product 2
    3. Product 2 + NaOMe -> Product 3
    4. Product 3 + Propanoic acid/DCC/DMAP -> Product 4

    # --- Step 1: Selective Hydrogenation of (R)-Limonene ---
    # Rule: Catalytic hydrogenation (Pd/C) of limonene preferentially reduces the
    # less-substituted, more sterically accessible exocyclic double bond over the
    # more-substituted endocyclic one. The stereocenter at C4 (R configuration) is not affected.
    # The answer correctly identifies Product 1 as (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene.
    # This step is correctly reasoned.
    
    # --- Step 2: Epoxidation of Product 1 ---
    # Rule: Epoxidation of an alkene with a nearby chiral center is diastereoselective.
    # The bulky isopropyl group at C4 directs the m-CPBA to the opposite (anti) face of the double bond.
    # The answer states this results in the (1S, 2R, 4R) epoxide. This is the known major
    # diastereomer from this specific reaction and represents correct application of stereochemical principles.
    # This step is correctly reasoned.

    # --- Step 3: Epoxide Ring Opening with Sodium Methoxide ---
    # Rule 1 (Regioselectivity): Under basic conditions (strong nucleophile like NaOMe),
    # the nucleophile (methoxide) attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide.
    # The epoxide is between C1 (tertiary) and C2 (secondary). The attack must occur at C2.
    # The answer correctly identifies C2 as the site of attack. This is correct.
    
    # Rule 2 (Stereospecificity): The reaction is an SN2-type attack, which causes
    # a complete inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked.
    # The initial configuration at C2 is (R). After inversion, it must become (S).
    # The configurations at C1 and C4 are not involved in the reaction and remain unchanged.
    # Expected config of Product 3: (1S, 2S, 4R).
    # The answer's derived configuration for Product 3 is (1S, 2S, 4R).

    # --- Step 4: Steglich Esterification ---
    # Rule: Steglich esterification converts an alcohol to an ester. The reaction occurs at the
    # oxygen atom and does not affect the stereocenters of the alcohol's carbon backbone.
    # The configuration of Product 4 should be the same as Product 3, i.e., (1S, 2S, 4R).
