    # --- Conclusion ---
    # If all checks pass, it means:
    # - Eigenvalues are real, so A and C are incorrect.
    # - Eigenvectors are not the standard basis, so B is incorrect/ambiguous.
    # - [Ay, A^2] = 0 and [Ay, Az] != 0, which makes statement D correct.
    # This confirms the provided answer and its reasoning.
