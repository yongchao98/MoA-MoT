def check_answer():
    """
    This function verifies the correctness of the answer to the chemistry question
    by applying established chemical principles.

    The core logic is as follows:
    1.  LiBH4 selectively reduces the ester. The subsequent lactonization retains stereochemistry.
        Therefore, to get an (R)-product, the starting material A must be (R).
    2.  BH3 selectively reduces the carboxylic acid. The subsequent lactonization retains stereochemistry.
        Therefore, to get an (S)-product, the starting material B must be (S).
    3.  The correct answer must propose A=(R) and B=(S).
