It is known to reduce esters to primary alcohols. While it can reduce carboxylic acids, the reaction is generally much slower than the reduction of esters. Therefore, LiBH4 can be used for the selective reduction of an ester in the presence of a carboxylic acid.

    "<information>### LiBH₄ Exhibits Selectivity for Esters Over Carboxylic Acids in Chemical Reductions\n\nLithium borohydride (LiBH₄) demonstrates a notable selectivity in chemical reactions, preferentially reducing esters to their corresponding alcohols while leaving carboxylic acids largely unaffected. This characteristic makes it a valuable reagent in organic synthesis for reactions requiring the targeted reduction of an ester in a molecule that also contains a carboxylic acid group.\n\nThe reactivity of LiBH₄ is stronger than sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) but weaker than lithium aluminium hydride (LiAlH₄). While NaBH₄ is generally not reactive enough to reduce either esters or carboxylic acids, LiAlH₄ is a much more powerful and less selective reducing agent, readily reducing both functional groups.\n\nThe enhanced reactivity of LiBH₄ towards esters compared to NaBH₄ is attributed to the lithium cation (Li⁺), which is a stronger Lewis acid than the sodium cation (Na⁺). The lithium cation coordinates to the carbonyl oxygen of the ester, polarizing it and making it more susceptible to nucleophilic attack by the hydride (H⁻) from the borohydride.\n\nIn contrast, the reaction of LiBH₄ with carboxylic acids is significantly slower. This allows for the selective reduction of esters when both functional groups are present in the same molecule. The choice of solvent can also influence the reactivity of LiBH₄, with ethers like tetrahydrofuran (THF) being common.\n\nThis selectivity is a key advantage in complex organic syntheses where precise control over which functional groups are transformed is crucial. For instance, a chemist can protect a carboxylic acid, reduce an ester elsewhere in the molecule with LiBH₄, and then deprotect the carboxylic acid, leaving it intact.</information>\nChecker feedback:\noutput: Correct",
    "<information>### LiBH₄ Exhibits High Selectivity for Esters Over Carboxylic Acids\n\nLithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a versatile reducing agent in organic synthesis, known for its ability to selectively reduce esters to primary alcohols, while leaving carboxylic acids largely unreacted. This selectivity makes it a valuable tool for chemists when working with molecules containing both functional groups.\n\nThe difference in reactivity stems from the electronic properties of esters and carboxylic acids. Esters are more susceptible to reduction by LiBH₄ compared to carboxylic acids. In fact, LiBH₄ is commonly used for the express purpose of reducing esters and lactones to their corresponding alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids, as well as other functional groups like tertiary amides and nitriles.\n\nThe enhanced reactivity of LiBH₄ towards esters, when compared to a weaker reducing agent like sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), is attributed to the lithium cation (Li⁺). The small and Lewis acidic lithium ion coordinates to the carbonyl oxygen of the ester, polarizing the carbonyl group and making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic and thus more susceptible to hydride attack.\n\nOn the other hand, carboxylic acids react with the basic LiBH₄ in an initial acid-base reaction to form a lithium carboxylate salt. This carboxylate is resonance-stabilized and has a negatively charged oxygen atom that donates electron density to the carbonyl carbon, making it less electrophilic and therefore less reactive towards reduction. While a very powerful reducing agent like lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) can reduce this carboxylate salt, the milder LiBH₄ is generally not reactive enough to do so efficiently.\n\nTherefore, when a molecule containing both an ester and a carboxylic acid functional group is treated with lithium borohydride, the ester is preferentially reduced to an alcohol, while the carboxylic acid remains intact. This selectivity is a key advantage of using LiBH₄ in complex organic syntheses.</information>\nChecker feedback:\noutput: Correct",
    "<information>### Lithium Borohydride Shows Preference for Esters Over Carboxylic Acids in Chemical Reductions\n\nLithium borohydride (LiBH₄) demonstrates notable selectivity in chemical reactions, preferentially reducing esters to alcohols while leaving carboxylic acids largely unreacted. This selectivity makes it a valuable tool for chemists in complex organic syntheses where specific functional groups need to be targeted.\n\nLithium borohydride is a more potent reducing agent than its more common counterpart, sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), but it is less reactive than lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄). This intermediate reactivity is key to its selectivity. While NaBH₄ is generally not strong enough to reduce either esters or carboxylic acids, LiAlH₄ will readily reduce both.\n\nThe selectivity of LiBH₄ for esters over carboxylic acids stems from the initial reaction that occurs with the acidic proton of the carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acids possess a proton that is readily given up, and this proton reacts with the hydride reagent from LiBH₄. This acid-base reaction is faster than the reduction of the carbonyl group. The resulting carboxylate salt is electron-rich and therefore less susceptible to nucleophilic attack by the hydride, rendering it resistant to reduction.\n\nIn contrast, esters lack this acidic proton. The lithium cation (Li⁺) in LiBH₄ can coordinate to the carbonyl oxygen of the ester, which polarizes the carbonyl group and makes the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic and thus more susceptible to hydride attack. This activation allows for the successful reduction of the ester to the corresponding primary alcohol.\n\nThis selective behavior is a significant advantage in multistep syntheses where a molecule may contain both an ester and a carboxylic acid group, and only the ester is intended for reduction. The choice of solvent can also influence the reactivity of LiBH₄, with ethers like tetrahydrofuran (THF) promoting its reducing power.</information>\nChecker feedback:\noutput: Correct",
    "<information>## LiBH₄ Exhibits High Selectivity for Esters Over Carboxylic Acids in Chemical Reductions\n\nLithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a versatile reducing agent in organic synthesis, known for its ability to selectively reduce esters to primary alcohols while leaving carboxylic acids intact. This selectivity is a key advantage in complex molecular syntheses where multiple functional groups are present.\n\nThe preferential reduction of esters over carboxylic acids by LiBH₄ stems from a combination of electronic and mechanistic factors. The primary reason for this selectivity lies in the initial interaction between the reducing agent and the two functional groups. Carboxylic acids, being acidic, readily react with the hydride reagent in an acid-base reaction. The acidic proton of the carboxylic acid is deprotonated by the hydride, forming a lithium carboxylate salt and hydrogen gas. This resulting carboxylate anion is significantly less electrophilic at the carbonyl carbon due to the delocalization of the negative charge, rendering it much less susceptible to nucleophilic attack by the hydride and thus, reduction.\n\nIn contrast, esters, which lack an acidic proton, do not undergo this deprotonation. Instead, the lithium cation (Li⁺) of LiBH₄ acts as a Lewis acid, coordinating to the carbonyl oxygen of the ester. This coordination polarizes the carbon-oxygen double bond, increasing the electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon and making it more vulnerable to nucleophilic attack by the hydride ion (H⁻) from the borohydride complex. This activation of the ester carbonyl group facilitates its reduction to the corresponding primary alcohol.\n\nThe mechanism for ester reduction by LiBH₄ involves the initial nucleophilic addition of a hydride to the carbonyl carbon, forming a tetrahedral intermediate. This intermediate then collapses, eliminating the alkoxy group to form an aldehyde, which is subsequently reduced further to the primary alcohol.\n\nIt is noteworthy that the reactivity of LiBH₄ can be influenced by the choice of solvent, with ethereal solvents like tetrahydrofuran (THF) being commonly used. While LiBH₄ is a stronger reducing agent than sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), which is generally unreactive towards both esters and carboxylic acids, it is less powerful than lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄), which readily reduces both functional groups without selectivity. Therefore, the unique reactivity profile of LiBH₄ makes it a valuable tool for chemists seeking to achieve selective transformations in molecules containing both ester and carboxylic acid functionalities.</information>\nChecker feedback:\noutput: Correct",
    "<information>### LiBH₄ Exhibits High Chemoselectivity, Favoring Ester Reduction Over Carboxylic Acids\n\nLithium borohydride (LiBH₄) demonstrates notable chemoselectivity by preferentially reducing esters to alcohols while generally leaving carboxylic acids intact under typical reaction conditions. This selectivity makes LiBH₄ a valuable reagent in organic synthesis when a molecule contains both functional groups and only the ester is targeted for reduction.\n\nThe difference in reactivity stems from the nature of the two functional groups and their interaction with the reducing agent. Esters are susceptible to reduction by LiBH₄, a reagent that is more powerful than sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) but less so than lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄). The enhanced reactivity of LiBH₄ compared to NaBH₄ is largely due to the presence of the lithium cation (Li⁺), which is a stronger Lewis acid than the sodium cation (Na⁺). This allows the lithium ion to coordinate to the carbonyl oxygen of the ester, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic and thus more susceptible to hydride attack.\n\nOn the other hand, carboxylic acids react with LiBH₄ first through an acid-base reaction. The acidic proton of the carboxylic acid is readily removed by the hydride, which acts as a base. This initial reaction forms a lithium carboxylate salt and hydrogen gas. The resulting carboxylate anion is significantly less electrophilic than the original carboxylic acid due to the negative charge being delocalized across the oxygen atoms. This deactivation makes the carboxylate resistant to reduction by the relatively mild LiBH₄.\n\nTherefore, in a molecule containing both a carboxylic acid and an ester functional group, LiBH₄ will selectively reduce the ester to the corresponding alcohol, while the carboxylic acid will be deprotonated to form a lithium carboxylate salt, which is generally unreactive towards further reduction by LiBH₄. For the reduction of carboxylic acids, stronger reducing agents such as lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) or borane (BH₃) complexes are typically required.</information>\nChecker feedback:\noutput: Correct"
