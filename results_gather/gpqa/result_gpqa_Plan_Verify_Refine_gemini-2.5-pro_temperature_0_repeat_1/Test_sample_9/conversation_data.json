    "<information>The average density of Earth is approximately 5.51 to 5.52 grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm³). This value is an average across the planet's different layers, including the crust, mantle, and core.\n\nEarth is the densest planet in our solar system. The density is calculated by dividing the planet's mass (approximately 5.97 x 10²⁴ kg) by its volume. While the Earth is not a perfect sphere, its volume can be approximated using the formula for a sphere.\n\nThe density varies throughout the Earth's interior, with the core being the densest layer and the crust being the least dense. For comparison, the density of water is about 1 g/cm³, making Earth about 5.5 times denser than water.</information>\nChecker feedback:\noutput: --- Verification of Exoplanet Density ---\nUsing physical model: ρ_new = ρ_old * (Mass_Ratio)^(1 - 3*β) with β=0.27\n\nCalculated densities (in g/cm^3):\n  a) Earth-like planet: 5.51\n  b) 2 M_earth planet: 5.50 (as given)\n  c) 5 M_earth planet: 7.48 (higher due to compression)\n  d) 0.5 M_earth planet: 4.83 (lower due to less compression)\n\n--- Conclusion ---\nThe planet with the highest calculated density is option 'c'.\n\nThe reasoning provided by the other LLM is physically sound and leads to the correct conclusion.\n\nFinal check result: Correct",

    "<information>### Mass Leads to Denser Rocky Planets\n\nFor rocky planets of the same composition, an increase in mass directly results in a higher density. This is because the greater the mass of a planet, the stronger its gravitational pull, which in turn compresses the planet's material into a smaller volume.\n\nThe fundamental definition of density is mass per unit volume. While one might intuitively assume that a more massive planet would be proportionally larger, this is not the case for celestial bodies. The immense gravitational force exerted by a planet's own mass causes the materials it is made of to be packed more tightly together. This gravitational compression means that as a rocky planet's mass increases, its volume does not increase at the same rate.\n\nStudies of exoplanets have provided clear evidence for this relationship. The mass-radius relationship for rocky exoplanets is approximately R ∝ M^0.27, where 'R' is the radius and 'M' is the mass. This formula indicates that the radius of a rocky planet increases significantly more slowly than its mass. For instance, if you were to double the mass of a rocky planet, its radius would not double but would increase by a much smaller factor. Since density is calculated by dividing mass by volume (which is related to the cube of the radius), a slower increase in radius relative to mass leads to a higher overall density for the more massive planet.\n\nTo distinguish between the effects of composition and gravitational compression on a planet's density, scientists use the concept of \"uncompressed density.\" This value represents the density a planet would have if the compressive effect of its own gravity were removed. For planets with the same composition, their uncompressed densities would be similar. However, their actual, or \"bulk,\" densities will differ based on their mass, with more massive planets exhibiting higher bulk densities due to greater gravitational compression.\n\nThe internal pressure within a planet also plays a crucial role. As you go deeper into a planet, the weight of the overlying material increases, leading to immense pressure and compression of the core. A more massive planet will have even greater internal pressures, further compacting the material at its center and increasing its overall density.</information>\nChecker feedback:\noutput: Correct"
