    "Here is a plan to solve the problem:\n*   Use the principles of conservation of energy and momentum for the decay process.\n*   Derive and calculate the kinetic energy of the muon ($K_\\mu$) first, assuming the neutrino is massless.\n*   Calculate the kinetic energy of the neutrino ($K_\\nu$) using the energy released in the decay.\n*   Compare the calculated kinetic energies with the given options.\n\nLet's execute the plan. I will now calculate the kinetic energy of the muon ($K_\\mu$) and the neutrino ($K_\\nu$). The kinetic energy of the muon can be found using the formula derived from conservation laws: $K_\\mu = \\frac{(m_\\pi c^2 - m_\\mu c^2)^2}{2 m_\\pi c^2}$. The total kinetic energy released is $Q = m_\\pi c^2 - m_\\mu c^2$, and the neutrino's kinetic energy is $K_\\nu = Q - K_\\mu$.\n\n```python\n# Given rest masses in MeV\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6  # Rest mass energy of Pi(+)\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7  # Rest mass energy of mu(+)\n\n# Calculate the kinetic energy of the muon (K_mu)\n# Formula: K_mu = (m_pi*c^2 - m_mu*c^2)^2 / (2 * m_pi*c^2)\nK_mu = (m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2)**2 / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value)\n# Assuming the neutrino is massless\nQ = m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2\n\n# Calculate the kinetic energy of the neutrino (K_nu)\n# K_nu = Q - K_mu\nK_nu = Q - K_mu\n\nprint(f\"Kinetic energy of the muon (K_mu): {K_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"Kinetic energy of the neutrino (K_nu): {K_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```",
    "The calculation based on the principles of conservation of energy and momentum for the two-body decay of a stationary particle has been performed.\n\n*   **Initial State:** A stationary pion ($\\pi^+$) with rest energy $E_\\pi = m_\\pi c^2 = 139.6$ MeV. The initial momentum is zero.\n*   **Final State:** A muon ($\\mu^+$) and a neutrino ($\\nu$). To conserve momentum, they must move in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitudes ($p_\\mu = p_\\nu$).\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** $m_\\pi c^2 = E_\\mu + E_\\nu$\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** $p_\\mu = p_\\nu$\n\nFrom these principles, the kinetic energy of the muon ($K_\\mu$) can be derived as:\n$K_\\mu = \\frac{(m_\\pi c^2 - m_\\mu c^2)^2}{2 m_\\pi c^2}$\n\nThe total energy released as kinetic energy (Q-value) is $Q = m_\\pi c^2 - m_\\mu c^2$. This energy is shared between the two product particles, so $K_\\mu + K_\\nu = Q$. Therefore, the kinetic energy of the neutrino is $K_\\nu = Q - K_\\mu$.\n\nThe Python script executed the following calculations:\n1.  Calculated the kinetic energy of the muon:\n    $K_\\mu = \\frac{(139.6 \\text{ MeV} - 105.7 \\text{ MeV})^2}{2 \\times 139.6 \\text{ MeV}} = \\frac{(33.9 \\text{ MeV})^2}{279.2 \\text{ MeV}} \\approx 4.12 \\text{ MeV}$\n2.  Calculated the total kinetic energy released:\n    $Q = 139.6 \\text{ MeV} - 105.7 \\text{ MeV} = 33.9 \\text{ MeV}$\n3.  Calculated the kinetic energy of the neutrino:\n    $K_\\nu = Q - K_\\mu = 33.9 \\text{ MeV} - 4.12 \\text{ MeV} \\approx 29.78 \\text{ MeV}$\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV (rounding 29.78) for the neutrino. These values match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
