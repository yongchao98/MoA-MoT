def check_drug_discovery_strategy_correctness():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the answer to a question about
    the most crucial step in pre-docking for a complex molecule.

    The logic is based on standard principles of structure-based drug discovery:
    1.  **Hierarchy of Evidence**: Experimental data (in vitro) is more reliable for validation
        than purely computational predictions (in silico).
    2.  **Risk Mitigation**: The biggest risk is spending resources on irrelevant molecular forms.
        The best strategy minimizes this risk.
    3.  **Pipeline Staging**: Steps must be performed in a logical order. Hit-finding (binding)
        precedes ADME/pharmacokinetic analysis.
