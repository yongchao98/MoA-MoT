    "*   **Plan:**\n    1.  Represent the general density matrix of a qubit using the Bloch vector `r = (r_x, r_y, r_z)`.\n    2.  Write the given density matrix `ρ` in its 2x2 matrix form.\n    3.  Compare the two matrix forms to solve for the components of the Bloch vector `r`.\n\n*   **Execution:**\n    The density matrix `ρ` for any single qubit state can be expressed using the Bloch vector `r = (r_x, r_y, r_z)` and the Pauli matrices `σ_x, σ_y, σ_z` as:\n    `ρ = (1/2) * (I + r · σ) = (1/2) * (I + r_x*σ_x + r_y*σ_y + r_z*σ_z)`\n\n    In matrix form, this becomes:\n    `ρ = (1/2) * [[1 + r_z, r_x - i*r_y], [r_x + i*r_y, 1 - r_z]]`\n\n    Now, let's find the matrix form of the given density matrix:\n    `ρ = (1/2) * (|0><0| + |1><1|)`\n    The basis states are `|0> = [[1], [0]]` and `|1> = [[0], [1]]`.\n    The outer products are:\n    `|0><0| = [[1, 0], [0, 0]]`\n    `|1><1| = [[0, 0], [0, 1]]`\n    Substituting these into the expression for `ρ`:\n    `ρ = (1/2) * ([[1, 0], [0, 0]] + [[0, 0], [0, 1]]) = (1/2) * [[1, 0], [0, 1]]`\n\n    Now, we equate the two matrix expressions for `ρ`:\n    `(1/2) * [[1 + r_z, r_x - i*r_y], [r_x + i*r_y, 1 - r_z]] = (1/2) * [[1, 0], [0, 1]]`\n\n    By comparing the elements of the matrices, we can solve for `r_x`, `r_y`, and `r_z`:\n    *   `1 + r_z = 1`  => `r_z = 0`\n    *   `r_x - i*r_y = 0` => `r_x = 0` and `r_y = 0`\n    *   `1 - r_z = 1`  => `r_z = 0`\n\n    Thus, the Bloch vector is `r = (0, 0, 0)`. This corresponds to the center of the Bloch sphere, which represents the maximally mixed state.\n\n<<<A>>>"
