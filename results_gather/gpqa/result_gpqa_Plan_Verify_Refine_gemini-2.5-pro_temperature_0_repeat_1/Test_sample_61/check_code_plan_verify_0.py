    # Reagents: NaNH2, methyl chloride
    # This is a standard reaction. The strong base NaNH2 deprotonates the terminal alkyne.

    # to a cis-alkene and stop there, without further reduction to an alkane.

    # Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond. A reductive workup with dimethyl sulfide (DMS)
    # ensures that the resulting fragments are aldehydes (or ketones), not carboxylic acids.

    # The base Ba(OH)2 will catalyze the required aldol reaction. Although a mixture of products will form
    # due to the presence of acetaldehyde, the synthesis of the target molecule is a valid and expected outcome.
