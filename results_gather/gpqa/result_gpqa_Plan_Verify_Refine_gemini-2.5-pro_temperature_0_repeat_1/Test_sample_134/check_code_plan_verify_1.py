def check_decay_answer():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the given answer for a particle decay problem.

    The question asks for the kinematically allowed decays of a boson X with a mass
    of 6 GeV into fermion-antifermion pairs. The kinematic condition for a decay
    X -> f f_bar is m_X > 2 * m_f.

    This function defines the mass of the boson X and the masses of the fundamental
    fermions, calculates the set of allowed decays based on the kinematic condition,
    and compares this calculated set with the set of decays from the proposed answer (Option A).
