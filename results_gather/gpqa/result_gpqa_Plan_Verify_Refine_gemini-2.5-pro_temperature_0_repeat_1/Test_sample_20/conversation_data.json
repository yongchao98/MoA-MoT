    "*   **Part A (Tautomerism):** Analyze benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione for their ability to undergo tautomerism. Tautomerism, specifically keto-enol tautomerism, requires an alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group).\n*   **Part B (Optical Isomerism):** Analyze methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate for optical isomerism. This requires identifying the presence of a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n*   **Conclusion:** Combine the findings from Part A and Part B to select the correct option.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Tautomerism**\n\nI will start by examining the structures of benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione to determine which one cannot undergo tautomerism.\n\n*   **Benzoquinone (specifically p-benzoquinone):** The structure is a six-membered ring with two C=O groups at opposite positions (1 and 4) and two C=C double bonds. The carbons adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached. Without alpha-hydrogens, keto-enol tautomerism cannot occur.\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This is a saturated six-membered ring with three C=O groups. The carbons between the carbonyl groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are CH₂ groups. These carbons are alpha to the carbonyls and possess alpha-hydrogens. These hydrogens can be removed to form an enol. In fact, this compound exists in equilibrium with its highly stable aromatic enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene).\n\nTherefore, the compound that does **not** show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**. So, **A = benzoquinone**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Optical Isomerism**\n\nNow I will examine the structures of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate to determine which one exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. Let's analyze the central carbon atom (C2), which is bonded to the hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   It is attached to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since this carbon is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center. Molecules with a chiral center are optically active (unless they are a meso compound, which is not the case here). Thus, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. This is an alkene with a trans configuration around the double bond. There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups, so there is no chiral center. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry, making it achiral and optically inactive.\n\nTherefore, the compound that **will** show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**. So, **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion**\n\nCombining the results:\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
