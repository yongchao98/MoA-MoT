    Checks the correctness of the LLM's answer regarding the solar neutrino flux ratio.

    The problem asks for the approximate ratio of neutrino flux in two energy bands
    after the pp-III branch (source of 8B neutrinos) has stopped.
    - Band 1: 700-800 keV
    - Band 2: 800-900 keV

    The LLM's answer is C) 0.01. This code verifies the physical reasoning and calculation.

    # All fluxes are in (neutrinos / cm^2 / s) and energies are in keV.

    # After the pp-III branch stops, 8B neutrinos are gone. Remaining sources are:
    # 1. 7Be neutrinos (pp-II branch): A sharp, monoenergetic line at 861 keV.
    # 2. CNO neutrinos (CNO cycle): A continuous spectrum.

    # To estimate the CNO flux in a specific 100 keV window, we need the flux density
    # (flux per keV). By inspecting published solar neutrino spectrum plots, the

    # order of 1.5e5 neutrinos / cm^2 / s / keV.
