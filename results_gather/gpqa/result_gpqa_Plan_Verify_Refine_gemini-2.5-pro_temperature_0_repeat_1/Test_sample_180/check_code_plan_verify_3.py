def check_neutrino_flux_ratio():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer to the solar neutrino flux question.

    The code models the physical reasoning required to solve the problem:
    1. It uses standard values for the total fluxes of the relevant neutrino sources (⁷Be and CNO).
    2. It identifies which sources contribute to each energy band after the hypothetical shutdown of the pp-III branch.
    3. It calculates the ratio based on a reasonable, physics-based estimation of the flux contributions.

    # --- Step 1: Define constants based on the Standard Solar Model (SSM) ---
    # Using recent data, e.g., from the Borexino experiment.
    # Fluxes are in neutrinos per cm^2 per second.
    
    # The pp-II branch produces a sharp neutrino line at 862 keV from ⁷Be decay.
    # This is the dominant component in the second energy band.
    FLUX_BE_TOTAL = 5.0e9  # Approx. 5.0 x 10^9 cm⁻²s⁻¹

    # The CNO cycle produces a continuous spectrum of neutrinos up to ~1.73 MeV (1730 keV).
    # This is the only source in the first energy band.
    FLUX_CNO_TOTAL = 7.0e8  # Approx. 7.0 x 10^8 cm⁻²s⁻¹
    
    # The pp-III branch (⁸B neutrinos) is turned off, so its flux is 0.

    # --- Step 2: Analyze the composition of the flux in each band ---
    
    # Band 1: 700-800 keV
    # Sources: Only the CNO cycle contributes. ⁷Be is at 862 keV (outside this band).
    
    # Band 2: 800-900 keV
    # Sources: The entire ⁷Be line flux (at 862 keV) and a small part of the CNO spectrum.

    # --- Step 3: Estimate the flux values for the ratio calculation ---

    # Numerator: Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV)
    # This is the portion of the CNO flux within this 100 keV window.
    # We need to estimate this fraction. The total CNO spectrum spans about 1730 keV.
    # A simple, order-of-magnitude estimate assumes a roughly uniform distribution,
    # even though the spectrum is actually peaked at lower energies.
    cno_energy_range_kev = 1730
    band_width_kev = 100
    
    # Fraction of CNO flux in a 100 keV band (a reasonable physics estimate).
    # A uniform distribution would give 100/1730 ≈ 0.058. This is a good starting point.
    fraction_cno_in_band1 = band_width_kev / cno_energy_range_kev
    
    flux_band1_cno = fraction_cno_in_band1 * FLUX_CNO_TOTAL

    # Denominator: Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV)
    # This is the sum of the total ⁷Be flux and the CNO flux in this band.
    # The CNO flux in this small band is negligible compared to the massive ⁷Be flux.
    # CNO flux in band 2 would be ~ (100/1730) * 7e8 ≈ 4e7
    # ⁷Be flux is 5e9.
    # 4e7 is less than 1% of 5e9, so we can approximate the denominator as just the ⁷Be flux.
    flux_band2_approx = FLUX_BE_TOTAL

    # --- Step 4: Calculate the final ratio ---
    
    # Ratio = Flux(Band 1) / Flux(Band 2)
    # Ratio ≈ (fraction_cno_in_band1 * FLUX_CNO_TOTAL) / FLUX_BE_TOTAL
    calculated_ratio = flux_band1_cno / flux_band2_approx
