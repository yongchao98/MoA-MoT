    """
    This function checks the correctness of the calculated enthalpy of neutralization.
    It follows these steps:
    1.  Define the initial conditions (volumes, molarities).
    2.  Calculate the total moles of H+ ions from the strong acids (HCl, H2SO4).
    3.  Calculate the total moles of OH- ions from the strong base (Ba(OH)2).
    4.  Identify the limiting reactant to find the moles of water formed.
    5.  Calculate the total enthalpy of neutralization using the standard value (-13.6 kcal/mol).
    6.  Compare the calculated result with the given answer (Option A).
