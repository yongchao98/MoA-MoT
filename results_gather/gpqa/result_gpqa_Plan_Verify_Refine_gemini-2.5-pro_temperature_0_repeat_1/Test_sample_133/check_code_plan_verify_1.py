    # Ba(OH)2 is a strong diacidic base (2 OH- per molecule).
    total_moles_oh = vol_baoh2 * conc_baoh2 * 2

    # 3. Identify the limiting reactant to find the moles of water formed.
    # The neutralization reaction is: H+ + OH- -> H2O
    # The amount of reaction is limited by the reactant with fewer moles.
    moles_water_formed = min(total_moles_h, total_moles_oh)
