    # --- Step-by-step Calculation ---

    # 1. Calculate total moles of H+ ions
    moles_h_from_hcl = vol_hcl * conc_hcl
    moles_h_from_h2so4 = vol_h2so4 * conc_h2so4 * 2  # H2SO4 is diprotic
    total_moles_h = moles_h_from_hcl + moles_h_from_h2so4

    # 2. Calculate total moles of OH- ions
    total_moles_oh = vol_baoh2 * conc_baoh2 * 2  # Ba(OH)2 is diacidic

    # 3. Determine the limiting reactant to find moles of water formed
    # The reaction is H+ + OH- -> H2O. The moles of water formed is the minimum
    # of the moles of H+ and OH-.
    moles_water_formed = min(total_moles_h, total_moles_oh)

    # 4. Calculate the total enthalpy of neutralization
    calculated_enthalpy = moles_water_formed * enthalpy_per_mole

    # --- Verification ---
    # Compare the calculated result with the given answer, using a small tolerance
    # for floating-point comparisons.
