    # --- Standard Value ---
    # The standard enthalpy of neutralization for a strong acid and strong base is approximately -13.6 kcal/mol.
    # This value is used as it's a common standard for such problems and leads to one of the options.
    enthalpy_per_mole_kcal = -13.6

    # --- Provided Answer ---
    # The LLM's answer is 'A', which corresponds to -2.72 kcal.
    llm_answer_value_kcal = -2.72

    # --- Step-by-step Calculation ---

    # 1. Calculate the total moles of H+ ions from the strong acids.
    # HCl is monoprotic (1 H+ ion per molecule).
    moles_h_from_hcl = vol_hcl * conc_hcl
    # H2SO4 is diprotic (2 H+ ions per molecule).
    moles_h_from_h2so4 = vol_h2so4 * conc_h2so4 * 2
    total_moles_h = moles_h_from_hcl + moles_h_from_h2so4

    # 2. Calculate the total moles of OH- ions from the strong base.
    # Ba(OH)2 is diacidic (2 OH- ions per molecule).
    total_moles_oh = vol_baoh2 * conc_baoh2 * 2

    # 3. Determine the limiting reactant for the neutralization reaction: H+ + OH- -> H2O.
    # The amount of water formed is limited by the reactant with the fewer moles.
    moles_water_formed = min(total_moles_h, total_moles_oh)

    # 4. Calculate the total enthalpy of neutralization.
    # This is found by multiplying the moles of water formed by the standard enthalpy per mole.
    # This calculation correctly ignores the heat of precipitation of BaSO4, focusing only on neutralization.
    calculated_enthalpy_kcal = moles_water_formed * enthalpy_per_mole_kcal

    # --- Verification ---
    # Check if the calculated enthalpy matches the provided answer's value.
    # A small tolerance (rel_tol) is used for floating-point comparison.
