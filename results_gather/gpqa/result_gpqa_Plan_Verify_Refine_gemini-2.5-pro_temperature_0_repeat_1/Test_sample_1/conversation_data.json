    "Here is a plan to solve the problem:\n1.  Determine the chemical structure and number of carbon atoms in the starting material, trans-cinnamaldehyde.\n2.  Analyze the first reaction (Grignard addition) to find the structure and carbon count of Product 1.\n3.  Analyze the second reaction (PCC oxidation) to find the structure and carbon count of Product 2.\n4.  Analyze the third reaction (Corey-Chaykovsky reaction) to find the structure and carbon count of the final Product 3.\n\nI will now execute this plan. The reactions are standard organic chemistry transformations, and I can determine the products and their carbon counts without needing external tools.\n\n1.  **Starting Material: trans-cinnamaldehyde**\n    *   Structure: C₆H₅-CH=CH-CHO. It consists of a phenyl group (6 carbons), a vinyl group (2 carbons), and an aldehyde group (1 carbon).\n    *   Total carbons = 6 + 2 + 1 = 9 carbons.\n\n2.  **Reaction 1: trans-cinnamaldehyde + methylmagnesium bromide → Product 1**\n    *   This is a Grignard reaction. The nucleophilic methyl group (CH₃⁻) from methylmagnesium bromide adds one carbon atom to the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde.\n    *   The product is a secondary alcohol: C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n    *   Carbon count of Product 1 = 9 (from cinnamaldehyde) + 1 (from methyl group) = 10 carbons.\n\n3.  **Reaction 2: Product 1 + pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) → Product 2**\n    *   PCC is an oxidizing agent that converts a secondary alcohol into a ketone.\n    *   This reaction does not change the carbon skeleton.\n    *   The product is an α,β-unsaturated ketone: C₆H₅-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   Carbon count of Product 2 = 10 carbons.\n\n4.  **Reaction 3: Product 2 + (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane → Product 3**\n    *   The reagent is dimethylsulfoxonium methylide, a sulfur ylide used in the Corey-Chaykovsky reaction.\n    *   When reacting with an α,β-unsaturated ketone, this specific ylide adds a methylene group (CH₂) across the carbon-carbon double bond to form a cyclopropane ring.\n    *   This reaction adds one carbon atom to the molecule.\n    *   Carbon count of Product 3 = 10 (from Product 2) + 1 (from the ylide's methylene group) = 11 carbons.\n\nThe final product, Product 3, contains 11 carbon atoms.\n\n<<<B>>>"
