    # This reaction adds exactly one carbon atom to the molecule.

    # that does not add or remove any carbon atoms from the carbon skeleton.

    # 1. Cinnamaldehyde has 9 carbons. (Correct, our code confirms)

    # 3. PCC oxidation adds 0 carbons. (Correct, our code confirms)
    # 4. Corey-Chaykovsky reaction adds 1 carbon. (Correct, our code confirms)
