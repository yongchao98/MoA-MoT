Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the multi-step synthesis problem.

**Plan:**
1.  Determine the structure of the starting material, 3,4-dimethylhexanedial.
2.  Analyze the first reaction, an intramolecular aldol condensation, to find the structure of the first intermediate.
3.  Analyze the second reaction, a Grignard reaction, to find the structure of the second intermediate.
4.  Analyze the third reaction, a PCC oxidation, to find the structure of the third intermediate.
5.  Analyze the final reaction, an oxidative ozonolysis, to determine the structure of the final product.
6.  Name the final product and select the corresponding option.

**Execution of the Plan:**

**Step 1: Starting Material and Aldol Condensation**
*   **Starting Material**: 3,4-dimethylhexanedial has a 6-carbon chain with aldehydes at C1 and C6, and methyl groups at C3 and C4. Its structure is `CHO-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CHO`.
*   **Reaction 1**: `KOH, H2O, THF, Heat` promotes an intramolecular aldol condensation. The enolate formed at C2 attacks the aldehyde at C6, forming a stable 5-membered ring. Subsequent dehydration (condensation) under heat forms a double bond conjugated with the remaining aldehyde.
*   **Product of Step 1**: `3,4-dimethyl-2-formylcyclopent-1-ene`.

**Step 2: Grignard Reaction**
*   **Substrate**: The aldehyde `3,4-dimethyl-2-formylcyclopent-1-ene`.
*   **Reaction 2**: `CH3CH2MgBr, H3O+`. The ethyl Grignard reagent adds to the aldehyde carbonyl carbon in a 1,2-addition. The acidic workup protonates the oxygen.
*   **Product of Step 2**: The aldehyde is converted to a secondary alcohol, yielding `1-(3,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-en-2-yl)propan-1-ol`.

**Step 3: PCC Oxidation**
*   **Substrate**: The secondary alcohol `1-(3,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-en-2-yl)propan-1-ol`.
*   **Reaction 3**: `PCC, CH2Cl2`. Pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) is an oxidizing agent that converts secondary alcohols to ketones.
*   **Product of Step 3**: `1-(3,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-en-2-yl)propan-1-one`.

**Step 4: Ozonolysis**
*   **Substrate**: The alkene `1-(3,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-en-2-yl)propan-1-one`.
*   **Reaction 4**: `O3, H2O`. This is ozonolysis with an oxidative workup. The reaction cleaves the C=C double bond in the cyclopentene ring, opening the ring.
    *   One carbon of the double bond has a hydrogen atom attached (`=CH-`). Oxidative cleavage converts this to a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`).
    *   The other carbon of the double bond has no hydrogen atoms attached. Cleavage converts this to a ketone (`=O`).
*   **Final Product Structure**: The ring opens to form a linear chain containing the original ethyl ketone group, a new ketone group, and a new carboxylic acid group. The structure is `CH3CH2-C(=O)-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH`.

**Naming the Final Product:**
*   The principal functional group is the carboxylic acid. Numbering the longest carbon chain starts from the `COOH` carbon (C1).
*   The chain is 8 carbons long, so the parent name is **octanoic acid**.
*   There are methyl groups at C3 and C4 (`3,4-dimethyl`).
*   There are two ketone (oxo) groups at C5 and C6 (`5,6-dioxo`).
*   The full IUPAC name is **3,4-dimethyl-5,6-dioxooctanoic acid**.

This name matches option C.
