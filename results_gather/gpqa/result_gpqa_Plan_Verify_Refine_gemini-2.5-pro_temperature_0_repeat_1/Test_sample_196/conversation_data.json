It reduces carboxylic acids (-COOH) completely to the corresponding alkane (-CH₃). It also reduces alcohols, ketones, and aldehydes to alkanes.\n</information>\nBased on the information gathered, I will now deduce the structure of Compound X.\n\n1.  **IR Analysis:**\n    *   `3400–2500 cm-1` (broad): This is characteristic of an O-H group in a carboxylic acid.\n    *   `1720 cm-1`: This is a C=O stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   `1610 cm-1`, `1450 cm-1`: These suggest an aromatic ring.\n\n2.  **1H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   `10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)`: Confirms the carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n    *   `8.0 ppm (d, 2H)` and `7.2 ppm (d, 2H)`: This pattern is classic for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm is for the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group.\n    *   This means we have a benzoic acid with a substituent at the para position.

The aromatic ring and the *sec*-butyl group will remain unchanged.\n*   **Product:** The -COOH on the benzene ring becomes a -CH₃. The *sec*-butyl group at position 4 is unaffected.

    "<information>### Key Features of a Carboxylic Acid IR Spectrum\n\nThe infrared (IR) spectrum of a carboxylic acid is distinguished by a few highly characteristic absorption bands that make this functional group readily identifiable. These key features arise from the unique structure of the carboxyl group (-COOH), which contains both a carbonyl (C=O) and a hydroxyl (O-H) group.\n\nThe most prominent and recognizable feature is the **very broad O-H stretching band**, which typically appears in the region of 3300-2500 cm⁻¹. The exceptional broadness of this band is a direct result of strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules, which commonly form dimeric structures. This broad absorption often overlaps with the sharper C-H stretching bands that appear around 3000 cm⁻¹.\n\nAnother definitive absorption is the **strong and sharp C=O stretching band** of the carbonyl group. This band is typically observed between 1760 and 1690 cm⁻¹. For carboxylic acids that exist as hydrogen-bonded dimers, this peak is commonly found centered around 1710 cm⁻¹. The exact position can be influenced by the molecular structure; for instance, conjugation with a double bond or an aromatic ring can lower the frequency of this absorption.\n\nIn addition to these two major peaks, the IR spectrum of a carboxylic acid also displays other characteristic absorptions:\n\n*   **C-O Stretching:** A band corresponding to the C-O single bond stretch appears in the 1320-1210 cm⁻¹ region.\n*   **O-H Bending:** Out-of-plane bending of the O-H group results in a broad peak in the 950-910 cm⁻¹ range. Another O-H bending vibration can be seen between 1440-1395 cm⁻¹, though it may be difficult to distinguish from C-H bending bands in the same area.\n\nIn summary, the combination of a very broad O-H stretch and a strong, sharp C=O stretch is the most reliable indicator of a carboxylic acid functional group in an IR spectrum.\n\nHere is a table summarizing the characteristic IR absorption bands for carboxylic acids:\n\n| Functional Group | Vibration Type | Characteristic Absorption (cm⁻¹) | Intensity |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| O-H | Stretch | 3300–2500 | Strong, very broad |\n| C=O | Stretch | 1760–1690 | Strong, sharp |\n| C-O | Stretch | 1320–1210 | Medium |\n| O-H | Bend | 1440–1395 and 950–910 | Medium, broad |</information>\nChecker feedback:\noutput: Correct"
