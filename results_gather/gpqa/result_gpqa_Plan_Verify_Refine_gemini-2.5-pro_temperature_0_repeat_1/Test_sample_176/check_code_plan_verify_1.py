    # Radial velocity of Star 2 in km/s
    v2_kms = 700.0
    # Speed of light in km/s
    c_kms = 299792.458

    # --- Step 1: Calculate the ratio of rest-frame wavelengths ---
    # The problem states the observed peak wavelengths are the same (lambda_obs_1 = lambda_obs_2).
    # For Star 1 (v1=0), the rest-frame wavelength equals the observed wavelength:
    # lambda_rest_1 = lambda_obs_1
    # For Star 2 (v2=700 km/s), we use the Doppler shift formula for a receding source:
    # lambda_obs_2 = lambda_rest_2 * (1 + v2/c)
    # So, lambda_rest_2 = lambda_obs_2 / (1 + v2/c)
    #
    # We need the ratio lambda_rest_2 / lambda_rest_1:
    # ratio = (lambda_obs_2 / (1 + v2/c)) / lambda_obs_1
    # Since lambda_obs_1 = lambda_obs_2, the ratio simplifies to:
    lambda_ratio_2_to_1 = 1.0 / (1.0 + v2_kms / c_kms)

    # --- Step 2: Calculate the temperature ratio using Wien's Law ---
    # Wien's Displacement Law: T is inversely proportional to lambda_rest.
    # Therefore, T1/T2 = lambda_rest_2 / lambda_rest_1
    temp_ratio_T1_to_T2 = lambda_ratio_2_to_1

    # --- Step 3: Calculate the luminosity ratio using the Stefan-Boltzmann Law ---
    # Stefan-Boltzmann Law: L is proportional to R^2 * T^4.
    # Therefore, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4
    luminosity_ratio = (radius_ratio**2) * (temp_ratio_T1_to_T2**4)

    # --- Step 4: Verify the final answer ---
    # The provided answer is B, which corresponds to a value of ~2.23.

    # We check if our calculated value is consistent with this.
