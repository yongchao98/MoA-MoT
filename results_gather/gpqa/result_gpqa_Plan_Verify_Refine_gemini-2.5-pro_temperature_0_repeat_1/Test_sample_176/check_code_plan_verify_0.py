    # --- Step 1: Doppler Shift and Wavelength Ratio ---
    # The problem states the observed peak wavelengths are the same: λ_obs_1 = λ_obs_2
    # For Star 1 (v1=0), the observed wavelength is the rest-frame wavelength: λ_obs_1 = λ_rest_1
    # For Star 2 (receding), the observed wavelength is Doppler shifted.
    # The non-relativistic formula is λ_obs_2 = λ_rest_2 * (1 + v2/c).
    # This is a valid approximation as v2 << c.
    # Therefore, λ_rest_1 = λ_rest_2 * (1 + v2/c).
    # This gives the ratio of the rest-frame wavelengths:
    # λ_rest_2 / λ_rest_1 = 1 / (1 + v2/c)
    
    beta = v2 / c
    lambda_ratio_2_to_1 = 1 / (1 + beta)

    # --- Step 2: Temperature Ratio from Wien's Law ---
    # Wien's Displacement Law states that T is inversely proportional to λ_rest (T ∝ 1/λ_rest).
    # Therefore, T1 / T2 = λ_rest_2 / λ_rest_1.
    temp_ratio_1_to_2 = lambda_ratio_2_to_1

    # --- Step 3: Luminosity Ratio from Stefan-Boltzmann Law ---
    # The Stefan-Boltzmann Law states that L = 4 * π * R² * σ * T⁴ (L ∝ R² * T⁴).
    # The ratio of luminosities is L1 / L2 = (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)⁴.
