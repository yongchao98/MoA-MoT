def check_luminosity_ratio():
    """
    This function verifies the calculation for the ratio of luminosities of two stars.

    It uses the following physics principles:
    1. Stefan-Boltzmann Law: L = 4 * pi * R^2 * sigma * T^4
       - The luminosity ratio L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4
    2. Wien's Displacement Law: lambda_max = b / T
       - The temperature ratio T1/T2 = lambda_max_2 / lambda_max_1 (for source wavelengths)
    3. Relativistic Doppler Effect: lambda_obs = lambda_source * sqrt((1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c))
       - This is used to find the relationship between the source temperatures, given that the
         observed peak wavelengths are the same.

    v2_kms = 700.0  # in km/s
    # Speed of light
    c_kms = 299792.458  # in km/s

    # --- Derivation ---
    # The problem states the observed peak wavelengths are the same: lambda_obs_1 = lambda_obs_2
    # For Star 1 (v1=0): lambda_obs_1 = lambda_source_1
    # For Star 2 (v2=700km/s): lambda_obs_2 = lambda_source_2 * sqrt((1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c))
    #
    # Equating them: lambda_source_1 = lambda_source_2 * sqrt((1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c))
    # Rearranging for the ratio needed for temperature:
    # lambda_source_2 / lambda_source_1 = 1 / sqrt((1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c))
    # lambda_source_2 / lambda_source_1 = sqrt((1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c))
    #
    # From Wien's Law, T is inversely proportional to lambda_source, so T1/T2 = lambda_source_2 / lambda_source_1
    # Therefore, T1/T2 = sqrt((1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c))
    #
    # Now, substitute this into the luminosity ratio formula:
    # L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4
    # L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (sqrt((1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c)))^4
    # L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * ((1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c))^2
