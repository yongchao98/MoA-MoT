    # 1. Calculate the momentum term (pc) in GeV.
    # The relativistic energy-momentum relation is E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m*c^2)^2.
    # Therefore, pc = sqrt(E^2 - (m*c^2)^2).

    except ValueError:
        return "Calculation error: E^2 - (m*c^2)^2 is negative. Energy must be greater than or equal to mass."

    # 2. Calculate the mean decay distance (L) in the lab frame.
    # The formula is L = (pc / (m*c^2)) * (hbar*c / Gamma).
    # We use pc and m in GeV, and Gamma and hbar*c in MeV-based units.
    # The ratio (pc / m*c^2) is dimensionless.
    # The ratio (hbar*c / Gamma) will result in units of femtometers (fm).
    L_fm = (pc_GeV / m_X_GeV) * (hbar_c_MeV_fm / Gamma_X_MeV)

    # 3. Convert the result from femtometers (fm) to meters (m).
    # 1 fm = 10^-15 m
