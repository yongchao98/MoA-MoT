    # --- Step 3: Determine the transition and calculate the energy difference (ΔE) ---
    # The energy levels of the non-rigid rotor are given by:
    # E(v, J) = (v + 1/2)*ħ*ω + B*J*(J+1), where B = ħ² / (2*I)

    # The fundamental state is (v=0, J=0).
    # The phrase "next state with the lowest possible energy" is ambiguous.
    # Possibility 1: The absolute next energy level, which is the first rotational state (v=0, J=1).
    # Possibility 2: The lowest energy transition allowed by rovibrational selection rules (Δv=+1, ΔJ=±1).

    # Let's analyze Possibility 2, as reasoned by the LLM, because it matches the options.
    # The selection rules for a photon absorption from J=0 require ΔJ=+1.
    # Therefore, the transition is from (v=0, J=0) to (v=1, J=1).

    # Energy of the initial state: E(0,0) = (1/2)*ħ*ω
    # Energy of the final state:   E(1,1) = (3/2)*ħ*ω + B*1*(1+1) = (3/2)*ħ*ω + 2B
    # The energy of the absorbed photon is the difference, ΔE:
    # ΔE = E(1,1) - E(0,0) = ( (3/2)*ħ*ω + 2B ) - ( (1/2)*ħ*ω )
    # ΔE = ħ*ω + 2B
    # Substituting B = ħ² / (2*I), we get:
    # ΔE = ħ*ω + ħ²/I

    delta_E = (H_BAR * w_rad_s) + (H_BAR**2 / I)

    # --- Step 4: Calculate the corresponding photon momentum (p) ---
    # The energy of a photon is related to its momentum by E = p*c.
