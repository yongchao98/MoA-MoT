    Checks the correctness of the LLM's answer by:
    1. Recalculating all physical quantities from the problem statement.
    2. Calculating the photon momentum for the two possible "next states":
       a) The true lowest energy state (a rotational transition).
       b) The first vibrational state (which the question likely intends).
    3. Comparing these calculated momenta with the given options.
    4. Evaluating the logic of the provided answer based on these comparisons.
