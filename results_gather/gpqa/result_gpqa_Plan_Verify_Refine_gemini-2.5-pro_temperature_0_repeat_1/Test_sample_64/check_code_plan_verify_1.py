This problem requires analyzing two distinct organic reactions to determine their major products, A and B.

**Plan:**
1.  Analyze the first reaction (1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol with KH/H+) to determine the structure of product A. This involves identifying the key reactive system and predicting the multi-step reaction cascade.
2.  Analyze the second reaction ((E)-pent-2-en-1-ol with acetyl bromide and LDA) to determine the structure of product B. This involves identifying the named reaction and its characteristic product.
3.  Compare the predicted structures of A and B with the given multiple-choice options to select the correct answer.

**Execution of Plan:**

**Step 1: Determine Product A**

*   **Reaction:** 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol + (THF, KH, H+) ---> A
*   **Analysis:**
    1.  The reactant, 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol, is a 1,5-dien-3-ol system, which is the substrate for an oxy-Cope rearrangement.
    2.  KH (potassium hydride) is a strong base that deprotonates the alcohol to form a potassium alkoxide. This initiates a rapid **anionic oxy-Cope rearrangement**.
    3.  This [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement opens the four-membered ring to form a ten-membered ring intermediate containing an enolate.
    4.  The information provided confirms that this intermediate does not simply tautomerize and stop. Instead, it undergoes a subsequent **transannular ene reaction**. This is a tandem cascade reaction.
    5.  The ten-membered ring ketone intermediate cyclizes via the ene reaction to form a thermodynamically stable bicyclic system. This specific tandem reaction is known to produce a **bicyclo[5.3.1]undecane** skeleton.
*   **Conclusion for A:** The product A is **(E)-bicyclo[5.3.1]undec-1(11)-en-4-one**. This eliminates options A and C.

**Step 2: Determine Product B**

*   **Reaction:** (E)-pent-2-en-1-ol + acetyl bromide (Base = LDA) ---> B
*   **Analysis:**
    1.  The combination of an allylic alcohol, an acylating agent (acetyl bromide), and a strong, non-nucleophilic base (LDA) is characteristic of the **Ireland-Claisen rearrangement**.
    2.  First, the alcohol is deprotonated by LDA to form a lithium alkoxide, which then reacts with acetyl bromide to form an allyl acetate ester.
    3.  LDA then deprotonates the alpha-carbon of the ester's acetyl group to form a lithium enolate.
    4.  This lithium enolate undergoes a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement. The rearrangement of the enolate of (E)-pent-2-en-1-yl acetate yields a new C-C bond.
    5.  The final product of the rearrangement, without an acidic workup, is the lithium salt of a carboxylic acid. The corresponding acid is **3-ethylpent-4-enoic acid**.
*   **Conclusion for B:** Since there is no acidic workup step mentioned, the product B exists as its salt form, which is **lithium 3-ethylpent-4-enoate**. This eliminates option B, which shows the protonated acid.

**Step 3: Final Selection**

*   Product A is (E)-bicyclo[5.3.1]undec-1(11)-en-4-one.
*   Product B is lithium 3-ethylpent-4-enoate.

This combination matches option D.
