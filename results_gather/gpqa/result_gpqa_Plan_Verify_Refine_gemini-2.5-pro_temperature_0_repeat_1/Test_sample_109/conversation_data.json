  "question": "Which of the following stars can be detected with both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory? Please refer to the links below for more information about the observatories. It should be noted that with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed, while with HIRES, stars brighter than 16 V mag can be observed. For the sake of simplicity, let's disregard the pointing limits of the telescopes (such as maximum and minimum elevations) as well as the altitudes of the telescopes.\n\nLinks:\nParanal Observatory: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranal_Observatory\nW.

    "An observer at a given latitude (lat) can, in principle, observe objects with a declination (dec) between -90° and +90°. However, for a ground-based telescope, an object is only visible if it rises above the horizon. Ignoring atmospheric refraction, this means the object's declination must be greater than `lat - 90°` and less than `lat + 90°`. Since we are ignoring pointing limits, we can assume the full sky visible from that latitude is accessible.\n\n*   **Paranal Observatory (ESPRESSO):**\n    *   Latitude ≈ -24.6° S\n    *   Visible Declination Range: `dec > -24.6 - 90 = -114.6°` (effectively -90°) and `dec < -24.6 + 90 = +65.4°`. So, **dec < +65.4°**.\n    *   Magnitude Limit: **m_V < 17**\n\n*   **Keck Observatory (HIRES):**\n    *   Latitude ≈ +19.8° N\n    *   Visible Declination Range: `dec > 19.8 - 90 = -70.2°` and `dec < 19.8 + 90 = +109.8°` (effectively +90°). So, **dec > -70.2°**.\n    *   Magnitude Limit: **m_V < 16**\n\nFor a star to be observable by **both**, it must satisfy the strictest conditions:\n1.  **Shared Declination Range:** -70.2° < dec < +65.4°\n2.  **Shared Magnitude Limit:** m_V < 16.0\n\nNow let's evaluate each star:\n\n**Star 1:**\n*   **Declination:** -75°. This is outside the shared range (it's too far south for Keck).\n*   **Conclusion:** Not observable by both.\n\n**Star 2:**\n*   **Declination:** +55°. This is within the shared range.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m_V):** 16.5 mag. This is fainter than the HIRES limit of 16.0.\n*   **Conclusion:** Not observable by both.\n\n**Star 3:**\n*   **Declination:** +48°. This is within the shared range.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m_V):** 15.5 mag. This is brighter than the 16.0 limit.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Observable by both.**\n\n**Star 4:**\n*   **Declination:** -48°. This is within the shared range.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m_V):** We must calculate it from the absolute magnitude (M_V), distance (d), and extinction (A_V).\n    *   m_V = M_V + 5 * log₁₀(d) - 5 + A_V\n    *   A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag\n    *   m_V = 15.5 + 5 * log₁₀(10) - 5 + 1.24 = 15.5 + 5 * 1 - 5 + 1.24 = **16.74 mag**\n    *   This is fainter than the HIRES limit of 16.0.\n*   **Conclusion:** Not observable by both.\n\n**Star 5:**\n*   **Declination:** +60°. This is within the shared range.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m_V):** We must calculate it from the absolute magnitude (M_V) and distance (d).\n    *   m_V = M_V + 5 * log₁₀(d) - 5\n    *   m_V = 16.5 + 5 * log₁₀(5) - 5 ≈ 16.5 + 5 * 0.699 - 5 = 16.5 + 3.495 - 5 = **14.995 mag**\n    *   This is brighter than the 16.0 limit.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Observable by both.**\n\nThe stars that can be detected with both spectrographs are Star 3 and Star 5.\n\n<<<B>>>"
