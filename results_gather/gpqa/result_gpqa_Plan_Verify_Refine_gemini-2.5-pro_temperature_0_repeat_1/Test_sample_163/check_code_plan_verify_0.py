    """
    This function checks the correctness of the LLM's answer to the binary star mass ratio problem.
    
    The total mass (M) of an eclipsing binary system (where inclination i ≈ 90°) is given by:
    M = (P * (K_a + K_b)^3) / (2 * pi * G * sin^3(i))
    
    When calculating the ratio of two such systems (M1 / M2), the constant term (2 * pi * G) cancels out.
    Since both are eclipsing systems, we assume sin(i) ≈ 1 for both, which also cancels out.
    
    The resulting formula for the mass ratio is:
    M1 / M2 = (P1 / P2) * ((K1a + K1b) / (K2a + K2b))^3
