    "*   **Plan:**\n    1.  Recall the relationship between the total mass of a binary system, its orbital period (P), and the radial velocity amplitudes (K_A, K_B). The total mass M is given by M = (P / (2πG)) * (K_A + K_B)³ / sin³(i), where i is the inclination. Since these are eclipsing binaries, we can assume i ≈ 90°, so sin(i) ≈ 1.\n    2.  Set up a ratio of the mass of system 1 (M1) to the mass of system 2 (M2). The physical constants (2πG) will cancel out.\n    3.
