def check_correctness():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the given answer to the biology riddle.

    The riddle describes the co-translational translocation process, which is the beginning of the secretory pathway for many proteins.

    1.  **"the ribonucleoprotein particle says to the nascent chain as they meet"**:
        -   The "ribonucleoprotein particle" is the Signal Recognition Particle (SRP).
        -   The "nascent chain" is a new polypeptide being synthesized by a ribosome.
        -   Their meeting point is on a ribosome in the **cytosol**. This is the starting location of the pathway.

    2.  **"Pause there for a minute. Let me show you in; you really need some sugar."**:
        -   The SRP pauses translation and guides the ribosome-nascent chain complex to the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER).
        -   The protein is translocated into the ER lumen, where glycosylation ("sugar" addition) begins.

    3.  **"It seems somewhat rough."**:
        -   This is a clear reference to the **Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum (RER)**, which is studded with ribosomes.

    4.  **"I guess this is goodbye; I need to be on my way"**:
        -   This indicates the protein is destined for secretion out of the cell.
        -   The full secretory pathway is: RER -> Golgi Apparatus -> Secretory Vesicles -> Plasma Membrane -> **Extracellular Space**.
        -   Therefore, the final destination is the extracellular space.

    The question asks for the meeting place (start) and the final destination (end).
    -   Start: Cytosol
    -   End: Extracellular space

        return f"Incorrect starting location. The riddle describes the meeting of the SRP and nascent chain, which happens in the '{correct_start}', not '{chosen_start}'."

    # Verify the final destination
    # The phrase "I need to be on my way" implies the protein is being secreted from the cell via the secretory pathway.
    # The final destination for a secreted protein is the extracellular space.
    if chosen_end != correct_end:
        # Check for other incorrect destinations
        if chosen_end == "proteasome":
            return f"Incorrect final destination. The answer states '{chosen_end}'. The proteasome is for protein degradation, not secretion. The clue 'I need to be on my way' implies secretion to the '{correct_end}'."
        return f"Incorrect final destination. The riddle implies the protein is being secreted, so its final destination is the '{correct_end}', not '{chosen_end}'."
