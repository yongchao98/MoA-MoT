    # Clue: "ribonucleoprotein particle says to the nascent chain as they meet"
    # Fact: The Signal Recognition Particle (SRP) binds to a nascent polypeptide on a ribosome.
    # Location: Ribosomes are in the cytosol.
    meeting_location = "cytosol"

    # Clue: "It seems somewhat rough... you really need some sugar."
    # Fact: This describes the Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum (RER), where N-linked glycosylation (adding sugar) begins.
    # This is the entry point to the secretory pathway.

    # Clue: "I guess this is goodbye; I need to be on my way"
    # Fact: This implies the protein is part of the secretory pathway, destined to be exported from the cell.
    # The final destination for a secreted protein is outside the cell.
