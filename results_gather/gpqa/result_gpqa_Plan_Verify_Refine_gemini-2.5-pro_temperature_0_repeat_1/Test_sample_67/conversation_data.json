    "This is a classic problem in quantum mechanics known as Larmor precession. I will solve it by determining the time evolution of the expectation value of the z-component of the spin.\n\n*   **Plan:**\n    1.  Define the initial state of the spin-1/2 particle.\n    2.  Write down the Hamiltonian for the new magnetic field in the Y-direction.\n    3.  Use the Schrödinger equation to find the state of the particle as a function of time.\n    4.  Calculate the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μz>(t)`, using the time-evolved state.\n    5.  From the resulting expression, identify the angular frequency of oscillation.\n\n*   **Execution:**\n    1.  **Initial State:** The particle is initially aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means it is in the spin-up eigenstate of the `Sz` operator. Let's denote this state as `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`. In the standard basis where `|+z> = [1, 0]^T` and `|-z> = [0, 1]^T`, the initial state is `|ψ(0)> = [1, 0]^T`.\n\n    2.  **New Hamiltonian:** The magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction, `B_vec = B * y_hat`. The Hamiltonian `H` for a magnetic moment `μ` in a magnetic field `B_vec` is `H = -μ · B_vec`. Since `μ = γS`, where `S` is the spin operator, the Hamiltonian is `H = -γ(S · B_vec) = -γB * Sy`.\n        The spin-y operator is `Sy = (ħ/2) * σy`, where `σy` is the Pauli Y-matrix: `σy = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n        So, `H = -γB(ħ/2) * σy`.\n\n    3.  **Time Evolution:** The state of the system evolves according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, `|ψ(t)> = exp(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)>`.\n        `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i[-γB(ħ/2)σy]t/ħ) |ψ(0)>`\n        `|ψ(t)> = exp(i * (γBt/2) * σy) |ψ(0)>`\n        To evaluate the matrix exponential, we use the identity `exp(iθσ_k) = cos(θ)I + i*sin(θ)σ_k`, where `θ = γBt/2` and `k=y`.\n        `exp(i * (γBt/2) * σy) = cos(γBt/2) * [[1, 0], [0, 1]] + i*sin(γBt/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n        `= [[cos(γBt/2), 0], [0, cos(γBt/2)]] + [[0, sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), 0]]`\n        `= [[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]]`\n        Now, we apply this operator to the initial state `|ψ(0)> = [1, 0]^T`:\n        `|ψ(t)> = [[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]] * [1, 0]^T`\n        `|ψ(t)> = [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)]^T`\n        In ket notation: `|ψ(t)> = cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>`.\n\n    4.  **Expectation Value:** We need to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μz> = γ<Sz>`. Let's first calculate `<Sz>(t) = <ψ(t)|Sz|ψ(t)>`.\n        The `Sz` operator is `Sz = (ħ/2)σz = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`.\n        `<Sz>(t) = [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] * (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)]^T`\n        `<Sz>(t) = [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] * (ħ/2) * [cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)]^T`\n        `<Sz>(t) = (ħ/2) * (cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2))`\n        Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`, we get:\n        `<Sz>(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(2 * γBt/2) = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n\n    5.  **Oscillation Frequency:** The average of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n        `<μz>(t) = γ<Sz>(t) = γ(ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n        This expression describes an oscillation of the form `A*cos(ωt)`. By comparing the two, we can identify the angular frequency `ω`.\n        `ω = γB`\n\nThe oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
