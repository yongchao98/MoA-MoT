    Checks the correctness of the LLM's answer for the gamma-ray annihilation problem.
    
    The problem is to find the threshold energy of a high-energy gamma-ray (E_gamma)
    colliding with a CMB photon (E_CMB) to produce an electron-positron pair.
    The reaction is: gamma + gamma_CMB -> e+ + e-

    The threshold condition for a head-on collision (which gives the minimum E_gamma) is:
    E_gamma = (m_e * c^2)^2 / E_CMB
