The threshold energy for this reaction is given by the condition that the center-of-mass energy is equal to the rest mass of the products, $2m_e c^2$. For a head-on collision between a high-energy photon of energy $E_\\gamma$ and a low-energy CMB photon of energy $E_{CMB}$, the threshold condition simplifies to:\n    $E_\\gamma = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$\n    I will now use Python to calculate $E_\\gamma$ using the given value for $E_{CMB}$ and the known value for the electron's rest mass energy.\n\n```python\n# Constants\n# Electron rest mass energy in eV\nm_e_c2_eV = 0.511e6  # 0.511 MeV = 5.11e5 eV\n# Average CMB photon energy in eV (given in the problem)\nE_CMB_eV = 1e-3\n\n# Threshold energy formula for a head-on collision\n# E_gamma * E_CMB = (m_e * c^2)^2\nE_gamma_eV = (m_e_c2_eV**2) / E_CMB_eV\n\n# Convert the result to GeV for comparison with the options\n# 1 GeV = 1e9 eV\nE_gamma_GeV = E_gamma_eV / 1e9\n\nprint(f\"Electron rest mass energy (m_e*c^2): {m_e_c2_eV:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"CMB photon energy (E_CMB): {E_CMB_eV:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Calculated gamma-ray threshold energy (E_gamma): {E_gamma_eV:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Calculated gamma-ray threshold energy (E_gamma): {E_gamma_GeV:.3e} GeV\")\n\n# Compare with options\n# A) 2.6e5 GeV\n# B) 3.9e5 GeV\n# C) 9.5e4 GeV\n# D) 1.8e5 GeV\n\noption_A = 2.6e5\nprint(f\"\\nComparing with Option A (2.6e5 GeV): Calculated value is {E_gamma_GeV:.2e}\")\n```\n\n*   **Result**\n    The calculation shows that the threshold energy for the gamma-ray is approximately $2.61 \\times 10^{14}$ eV, which is equal to $2.61 \\times 10^5$ GeV.

    "*   **Plan**\n    1.  Establish the kinematic threshold equation for the pair production process ($\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$). This involves relating the energies of the incoming photons to the rest mass of the electron-positron pair produced.\n    2.

Use a Python script to plug in the known physical constants (electron rest mass energy, CMB average photon energy) and calculate the threshold energy of the gamma-ray.\n    4.  Compare the calculated result with the provided multiple-choice options.\n\n*   **Action**\n    The physical process is the annihilation of a high-energy gamma-ray ($\\gamma$) with a Cosmic Microwave Background photon ($\\gamma_{CMB}$) to produce an electron-positron pair ($e^{+}e^{-}$). The reaction is $\\gamma + \\gamma_{CMB} \\rightarrow e^+ + e^-$.\n\n    To find the minimum (threshold) energy of the high-energy gamma-ray, we consider the kinematics of the collision. The total four-momentum squared (invariant mass squared, $s$) must be at least the square of the rest mass of the products.\n    $s = (p_\\gamma + p_{CMB})^2 \\ge (2m_e c^2)^2$\n\n    Expanding the four-vector product for the two photons:\n    $s = 2 E_\\gamma E_{CMB} (1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n    where $E_\\gamma$ is the energy of the high-energy photon, $E_{CMB}$ is the energy of the CMB photon, and $\\theta$ is the angle between their directions of travel.\n\n    To find the minimum $E_\\gamma$, we need to maximize the $(1 - \\cos\\theta)$ term. This occurs for a head-on collision, where $\\theta = \\pi$ radians (180 degrees), making $\\cos\\theta = -1$. This gives $(1 - (-1)) = 2$.\n\n    The threshold condition is therefore:\n    $4 E_\\gamma E_{CMB} = (2m_e c^2)^2$\n    $E_\\gamma = \\frac{(2m_e c^2)^2}{4 E_{CMB}} = \\frac{4(m_e c^2)^2}{4 E_{CMB}} = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$\n\n    Now, I will calculate this value using the provided data.\n\n*   **Action**\n    ```python\n    # Physical constants\n    # Electron rest mass energy (m_e*c^2) in eV. Standard value is ~0.511 MeV.\n    m_e_c2_eV = 0.511e6\n    # Average CMB photon energy in eV, as given in the problem.\n    E_CMB_eV = 1e-3\n\n    # Calculate the threshold energy for the high-energy gamma-ray in eV.\n    # Formula: E_gamma = (m_e*c^2)^2 / E_CMB\n    E_gamma_eV = (m_e_c2_eV**2) / E_CMB_eV\n\n    # Convert the result from eV to GeV for comparison with the options.\n    # 1 GeV = 1e9 eV\n    E_gamma_GeV = E_gamma_eV / 1e9\n\n    print(f\"Threshold gamma-ray energy: {E_gamma_GeV:.3e} GeV\")\n    ```\n\n*   **Result**\n    Threshold gamma-ray energy: 2.611e+05 GeV\n\n*   **Plan**\n    1.  The calculation yielded a threshold energy of $2.611 \\times 10^5$ GeV.\n    2.
