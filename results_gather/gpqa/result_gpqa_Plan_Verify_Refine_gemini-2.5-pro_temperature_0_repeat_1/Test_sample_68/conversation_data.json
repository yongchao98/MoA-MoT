    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n*   Calculate the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$) of the $X^0$ particle using its total energy and mass.\n*   Calculate the time ($t$) in the lab frame for 30% of the particles to decay.

    "My previous calculation was incorrect. The result `6.719e-7 m` is the distance at which exactly 30% of the particles have decayed. This doesn't match any of the options. Let me re-evaluate the problem. A more standard characteristic distance for decay is the mean decay length, which is the average distance a particle travels before it decays.
