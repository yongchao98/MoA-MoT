    # The question provides four options. Option A is the only one with the correct
    # order of magnitude. We will check the correctness of this option.
    # A) 2.08*1e-6 m
    answer_value = 2.08e-6  # m

    # --- Physics Calculation ---

    # 1. Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma) from the energy-mass relation E = gamma * m0.
    try:
        if m0 <= 0:
            return "Constraint failed: Mass m0 must be positive."

    except ZeroDivisionError:
        return "Constraint failed: Mass m0 cannot be zero."

    # 2. Calculate the mean decay length in the lab frame (<L>).
    # The formula is <L> = c * tau0 * sqrt(gamma^2 - 1).
    if gamma < 1:
        return f"Constraint failed: Calculated Lorentz factor gamma ({gamma:.3f}) is less than 1, which is physically impossible. This implies E < m0."
    
    mean_decay_length = c * tau0 * math.sqrt(gamma**2 - 1)

    # 3. Determine the required resolution distance (d).
    # "Observing" a decay means the particle travels a distance L greater than the resolution d.
    # The probability of traveling a distance greater than d is P(L > d) = exp(-d / <L>).
    # We need P(L > d) >= observation_fraction.
    # This leads to the inequality: d <= -mean_decay_length * ln(observation_fraction).
    # This calculated value is the maximum permissible resolution.
    d_limit = -mean_decay_length * math.log(observation_fraction)

    # --- Verification ---

    # Check 1: The provided answer must satisfy the physical constraint.
    # A resolution of `answer_value` must be small enough to observe at least 30% of decays.
    if answer_value > d_limit:
        return (f"Incorrect. The provided answer {answer_value:.3e} m does not satisfy the condition. "
                f"To observe at least {observation_fraction*100}% of decays, the resolution must be d <= {d_limit:.3e} m. "
                f"The provided answer is too large, meaning fewer than {observation_fraction*100}% of decays would be resolved.")

    # Check 2: The provided answer should be numerically close to the calculated limit.
    # A small discrepancy is acceptable due to potential rounding in the problem's source.
    relative_error = abs(answer_value - d_limit) / d_limit
    tolerance = 0.10  # 10% tolerance

    if relative_error > tolerance:
        return (f"Incorrect. The calculated resolution limit is {d_limit:.3e} m. "
                f"The provided answer {answer_value:.3e} m has a relative error of {relative_error:.1%}, which is larger than the allowed tolerance of {tolerance:.1%}. "
                "This points to a significant discrepancy.")

    # If the answer satisfies the physical constraint and is numerically close, it is correct.
    return "Correct"
