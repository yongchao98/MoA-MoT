    Checks the correctness of the LLM's answer for the particle decay problem.

    The function calculates two key distances:
    1. The mean decay length (L), which the LLM's code calculates.
    2. The distance for 30% decay (d), which is what the question literally asks for.

    It then compares these values to the problem's constraints and options.
