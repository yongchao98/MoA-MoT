    "This is a problem in quantum mechanics concerning the addition of angular momentum. I will determine the probability by projecting the given coupled state onto the desired uncoupled measurement state.\n\n*   **Plan:**\n    1.  Identify the initial state (coupled basis) and the final state (uncoupled basis) from the problem description.\n    2.  The probability is the square of the magnitude of the inner product of these two states. This inner product is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.\n    3.  Apply the selection rule for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which states that the coefficient is zero unless the magnetic quantum numbers sum correctly ($m = m_1 + m_2$).\n    4.  Calculate the probability based on the selection rule.\n\n*   **Execution:**\n    1.  **Initial State:** The system is in the coupled angular momentum state $|\\psi_{initial}> = |l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$. Here, the total angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$ and its z-component is $m=-1$.\n    2.  **Final State:** A measurement of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ is performed. We want the probability of getting the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$ for both. This corresponds to the quantum numbers $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. The state for this measurement outcome, in the uncoupled basis, is $|\\psi_{final}> = |l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2> = |1, -1; 1, -1>$.\n    3.  **Probability Calculation:** The probability $P$ is given by the squared modulus of the amplitude to find the system in the final state, given it started in the initial state:\n        $P = |<\\psi_{final}|\\psi_{initial}>|^2 = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>|^2$\n    4.  **Apply Selection Rule:** The term $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>$ is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. A fundamental property (selection rule) of these coefficients is that they are non-zero only if $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n        Let's check this condition with the given quantum numbers:\n        -   From the initial state $|l=2, m=-1>$, we have $m = -1$.\n        -   From the final state $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1>$, we have $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n        -   The sum is $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n        -   The condition $m = m_1 + m_2$ becomes $-1 = -2$, which is false.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    Since the selection rule $m = m_1 + m_2$ is not satisfied, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero.\n    $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1> = 0$\n    Therefore, the probability is $P = 0^2 = 0$.\n\nThis result has a clear physical interpretation. The initial state is an eigenstate of the total z-component of angular momentum $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$ with eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$. Any measurement of the individual components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ must yield eigenvalues $m_1\\hbar$ and $m_2\\hbar$ such that their sum is equal to the total, i.e., $m_1 + m_2 = m$. In this case, the desired measurement outcome has $m_1 + m_2 = -2$, which violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum for the given initial state. Thus, such an outcome is impossible.\n\n<<<A>>>"
