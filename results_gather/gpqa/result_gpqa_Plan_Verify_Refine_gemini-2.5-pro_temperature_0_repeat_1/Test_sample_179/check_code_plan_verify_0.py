    # 2. Calculate the potential energy between the central charge and the 12 on the sphere
    # The potential energy for one pair is (k * q_center * q_sphere) / r.
    # Since all charges are identical (q) and there are N=12 charges on the sphere:
    # U_center_sphere = N * (k * q^2 / r)
    U_center_sphere = N * k * q**2 / r

    # 3. Calculate the potential energy of the 12 charges on the sphere (U_sphere_sphere)
    # The minimum energy configuration for 12 charges on a sphere is an icosahedron.
    # We need to sum the potential energy for all N*(N-1)/2 = 12*11/2 = 66 pairs.
    # The distances between vertices of an icosahedron inscribed in a sphere of radius r
    # fall into three groups.

    # Each vertex has 5 adjacent vertices -> 12 * 5 / 2 = 30 pairs

    # Each vertex has 1 antipodal vertex -> 12 / 2 = 6 pairs

    # The remaining pairs are 66 - 30 - 6 = 30 pairs
    num_d2_pairs = 30

    # d2: Distance between non-adjacent, non-antipodal vertices
    d2 = r * np.sqrt(2 + 2/sqrt5)
    # d3: Distance between antipodal vertices (diameter)
    d3 = 2 * r

    # The potential energy is k*q^2 * sum(1/distance) for all pairs
    sum_of_inverse_distances = (num_d1_pairs / d1) + (num_d2_pairs / d2) + (num_d3_pairs / d3)
