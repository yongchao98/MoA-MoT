    Calculates the minimum potential energy of the system of 13 charges.

    The system consists of:
    - 1 charge at a central point P.
    - 12 charges constrained to a sphere of radius r=2m around P.

    To minimize energy, the 12 outer charges form a regular icosahedron.
    The total energy is the sum of:
    1. Energy of the 12 outer charges interacting with the central charge.
    2. Energy of the 12 outer charges interacting with each other.
