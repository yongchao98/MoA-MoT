            f"1.  The LLM's response contains a significant calculation error. The Python code snippet in the LLM's answer, if executed correctly, yields {U_total_calculated:.4e} J. However, the LLM reports a completely different result ({llm_answer_value:.3e} J) in its output log, suggesting the output was fabricated rather than computed.\n"
            f"2.  The LLM's result is physically implausible. It states the energy of the 12 charges on the sphere interacting with each other is `U_icosahedron = 1.5278e-27 J`, while their interaction with the single central charge is `U_center_sphere = 5.5285e-27 J`. The interaction energy of 66 pairs of charges on the sphere should be significantly larger, not smaller, than the energy of 12 pairs with the center. The correct calculation shows `U_sphere_sphere` ({U_sphere_sphere:.3e} J) is about {U_sphere_sphere/U_center_sphere:.1f} times larger than `U_center_sphere` ({U_center_sphere:.3e} J)."
