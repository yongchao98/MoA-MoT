    "This problem requires determining the structure of a final product from a four-step reaction sequence and then counting its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Bromine → Product 1**\nThis is the alpha-bromination of a ketone. The reaction places a bromine atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-bromocyclohexanone\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) + NaOH (heated) → Product 2**\nThis is a classic example of the Favorskii rearrangement. An α-halo ketone treated with a strong base rearranges to form a carboxylic acid with a smaller ring. The hydroxide ion deprotonates the α'-carbon, which then attacks the carbon bearing the bromine, forming a bicyclic intermediate. This intermediate is then attacked by hydroxide at the carbonyl, leading to ring-opening and formation of a cyclopentanecarboxylate anion, which is protonated upon workup.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) + Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and Pyridine → Product 3**\nThis is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride. Thionyl chloride replaces the -OH group with a -Cl group.\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride → Product 4**\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃) is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent. It selectively reduces acyl chlorides to aldehydes, stopping the reaction at that stage without further reduction to an alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde\n\n**Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogens in Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde)**\n\nThe structure of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde is a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO). We need to identify all the hydrogen atoms that are in unique chemical environments.\n\nLet's label the carbons: C1 is the ring carbon attached to the aldehyde, C2/C5 are the adjacent carbons, and C3/C4 are the carbons beta to the aldehyde group.\n\n1.  **Aldehyde Hydrogen (H on C=O):** This hydrogen is unique. (1 type)\n2.  **C1 Hydrogen (methine H):** The single hydrogen on the carbon attached to the aldehyde group is in a unique environment. (1 type)\n3.  **C2/C5 Hydrogens (alpha-hydrogens):** Due to a plane of symmetry passing through the C1-CHO bond and the C3-C4 bond midpoint (on a time-averaged basis due to ring puckering), the two hydrogens on C2 are equivalent to the two on C5. However, the two hydrogens on C2 itself are diastereotopic because C1 is a prochiral center. One is cis to the aldehyde group, and one is trans. Therefore, these four hydrogens represent two distinct types. (2 types)\n4.  **C3/C4 Hydrogens (beta-hydrogens):** Similarly, the two hydrogens on C3 are equivalent to the two on C4. The two hydrogens on C3 are also diastereotopic. These four hydrogens represent another two distinct types. (2 types)\n\nTotal number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms = 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (alpha-Hs) + 2 (beta-Hs) = **6**.\n\nTherefore, there are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
