    This function checks the correctness of the answer to a question about
    parallelizing numerical methods for solving higher-dimensional heat equations.

    The question is:
    "While solving higher dimensional heat equations subject to suitable initial and
    boundary conditions through higher order finite difference approximations and
    parallel splitting, the matrix exponential function is approximated by a
    fractional approximation. The key factor of converting sequential algorithm
    into parallel algorithm is..."

    The options are:
    A) Stability analysis
    B) Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation
    C) Complex roots of fractional approximation
    D) Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions

    The provided answer is 'B'.

    # --- Logical Analysis ---
    # 1. The fundamental principle of parallel computing is to break a large problem
    #    into smaller, independent sub-problems that can be solved concurrently.
    # 2. The problem involves approximating a matrix exponential `exp(tA)v` with a
    #    rational function `R(tA)v`.
    # 3. The technique of "linear partial fraction decomposition" breaks the rational
    #    function `R(z)` into a sum of simpler terms: `R(z) = Σ [c_i / (z - p_i)]`.
    # 4. Applying this to the matrix problem `x = R(A)b` yields a sum of independent
    #    linear systems: `x = Σ [c_i * (A - p_i*I)^-1 * b]`.
    # 5. Each of these systems can be solved in parallel. This directly converts the
    #    sequential problem into a parallel one.
    # 6. Therefore, the partial fraction decomposition is the key enabling factor.
