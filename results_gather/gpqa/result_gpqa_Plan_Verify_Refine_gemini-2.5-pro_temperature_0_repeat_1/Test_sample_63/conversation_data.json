The products contain H, O, and the element(s) in gas C. Gas C is unreactive, suggesting it's N₂. Let's verify this by checking the mass balance.\n    2.  The gas mixture passed over hot copper contained an oxidizing agent and gas C. The oxidizing agent provided 0.05 mol of O atoms. This could be 0.025 mol of O₂ or 0.05 mol of N₂O (which would decompose to N₂ and CuO).\n    3.  Let's test the hypothesis that the initial gas mixture was H₂O, N₂O, and N₂. The N₂O would react with Cu (`N₂O + Cu -> N₂ + CuO`), and the N₂ produced would combine with the initial N₂ to form gas C.\n    4.  Let's calculate the total mass of the products assuming the gases are H₂O, N₂O, and N₂ and see if it matches the initial 7.20 g.\n\n*   **Action:** Calculate the total mass of the products assuming the oxidizing gas was N₂O and the final gas C is N₂.\n\n```python\n# From previous step\nmoles_H2O = 0.20\nmoles_O_from_oxidizer = 0.05\nmoles_C_final = 0.10\n\n# Hypothesis: Oxidizing gas is N2O, final gas C is N2.\n# The reaction in tube 3 is: N2O + Cu -> N2 + CuO\n# This means moles of N2O = moles of O atoms = 0.05 mol.\n# The N2 produced from this reaction is also 0.05 mol.\nmoles_N2O = 0.05\n\n# The final gas C (0.10 mol) is the sum of N2 from N2O decomposition and any initial N2.\n# Moles of initial N2 = Moles of final C - Moles of N2 from N2O\nmoles_initial_N2 = 0.10 - 0.05\nif moles_initial_N2 < 0:\n    print(\"Hypothesis is inconsistent.

The decomposition products are: 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.05 mol N₂O, and 0.05 mol N₂.\n    2.  The salts A and B are equimolar. Let `n` be the moles of A and `n` be the moles of B. The total moles of products come from `n` moles of A and `n` moles of B.\n    3.  We need to find two common nitrogen-containing salts that decompose upon heating to produce this specific mixture of gases. Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) are strong candidates.\n        *   Decomposition of NH₄NO₃: `NH₄NO₃ -> N₂O + 2H₂O`\n        *   Decomposition of NH₄NO₂: `NH₄NO₂ -> N₂ + 2H₂O`\n    4.  Let's see if an equimolar mixture of these two salts produces the observed molar ratio of products.\n\n*   **Action:** Assume salts A and B are NH₄NO₃ and NH₄NO₂. Check if their combined decomposition matches the product moles.\n\n```python\n# Let's assume we have n moles of NH4NO3 and n moles of NH4NO2.\n# Reaction 1: n NH4NO3 -> n N2O + 2n H2O\n# Reaction 2: n NH4NO2 -> n N2 + 2n H2O\n# Total products: n N2O + n N2 + 4n H2O\n\n# From our experiment, we found the products to be:\n# 0.05 mol N2O, 0.05 mol N2, 0.20 mol H2O\n\n# Let's compare the molar ratios:\n# N2O : N2 : H2O\n# Theoretical ratio from reactions: n : n : 4n  which simplifies to 1 : 1 : 4\n# Experimental ratio from data: 0.05 : 0.05 : 0.20 which simplifies to 1 : 1 : 4\n\n# The ratios match perfectly. This confirms our hypothesis.\n# From the ratios, we can see that n = 0.05 mol.\n# So, the initial mixture was 0.05 mol of NH4NO3 and 0.05 mol of NH4NO2.\n\n# Let's identify the salts and count the atoms.\n# Salt A: NH4NO3 (Ammonium Nitrate)\n# Atoms in NH4NO3 = 2*N + 4*H + 3*O = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms\n\n# Salt B: NH4NO2 (Ammonium Nitrite)\n# Atoms in NH4NO2 = 2*N + 4*H + 2*O = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms\n\n# Total number of atoms in salts A and B\ntotal_atoms = 9 + 8\n\nprint(f\"Salt A is NH4NO3, which has {9} atoms.\")\nprint(f\"Salt B is NH4NO2, which has {8} atoms.\")\nprint(f\"The total number of all atoms in salts A and B is {total_atoms}.\")\n```\n\n*   **Result:**\n    *   Salt A is NH₄NO₃, which has 9 atoms.\n    *   Salt B is NH₄NO₂, which has 8 atoms.\n    *   The total number of all atoms in salts A and B is 17.\n\n*   **Final Answer:** The analysis has consistently led to the identification of the salts as ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite. The total number of atoms is 17. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "*   **Plan:**\n    1.  Calculate the moles of the decomposition products (water, the gas that reacted with copper, and the final inert gas) from the experimental data.\n    2.  Identify the chemical formulas of the gaseous products by using the molar quantities and reaction information, and verify with a mass balance calculation.\n    3.  Deduce the formulas of the two equimolar salts (A and B) that would produce this specific mixture of gases upon decomposition.\n    4.  Calculate the total number of atoms in the formulas of salts A and B.\n\n*   **Action:** Calculate the moles of water (H₂O) absorbed by Mg(ClO₄)₂, the moles of oxygen atoms that reacted with copper, and the moles of the final gas C.\n\n```python\n# Molar masses\nM_H2O = 18.015  # g/mol\nM_O = 15.999    # g/mol\n\n# Given masses and volume\nmass_increase_tube1 = 3.60  # g (This is the mass of H2O)\nmass_increase_tube3 = 0.80    # g (This is the mass of O atoms in CuO)\nvolume_C_STP = 2.24  # L\nmolar_volume_STP = 22.4 # L/mol\n\n# Calculate moles\nmoles_H2O = mass_increase_tube1 / M_H2O\nmoles_O_atoms = mass_increase_tube3 / M_O\nmoles_gas_C = volume_C_STP / molar_volume_STP\n\nprint(f\"Moles of H2O = {moles_H2O:.4f} mol\")\nprint(f\"Moles of O atoms = {moles_O_atoms:.4f} mol\")\nprint(f\"Moles of gas C = {moles_gas_C:.4f} mol\")\n```\n\n*   **Result:**\n    *   Moles of H₂O ≈ 0.20 mol\n    *   Moles of O atoms ≈ 0.05 mol\n    *   Moles of gas C ≈ 0.10 mol\n\n*   **Plan Refinement:**\n    1.  The products are 0.20 mol H₂O, an oxidizing gas that supplied 0.05 mol of O atoms, and 0.10 mol of an inert gas C. The absence of reaction with Ca(OH)₂ means no acidic gases like CO₂. The elements involved are H, O, and likely N (as gas C is inert, suggesting N₂).\n    2.  Let's identify the oxidizing gas. A common decomposition product containing N and O is N₂O. The reaction with copper is `N₂O + Cu -> N₂ + CuO`. This reaction shows that 1 mole of N₂O provides 1 mole of O atoms to form CuO. Therefore, 0.05 mol of O atoms came from 0.05 mol of N₂O.\n    3.  This reaction also produces 0.05 mol of N₂. The final gas C (0.10 mol of N₂) must be the sum of N₂ produced from N₂O and any N₂ that was in the original gas mixture. Thus, initial N₂ = 0.10 mol (total) - 0.05 mol (from N₂O) = 0.05 mol.\n    4.  So, the initial gas mixture from the decomposition was: 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.05 mol N₂O, and 0.05 mol N₂. Let's check if the total mass of these gases equals the initial 7.20 g.\n\n*   **Action:** Calculate the total mass of the deduced gas mixture (0.20 mol H₂O, 0.05 mol N₂O, 0.05 mol N₂) to verify our hypothesis.\n\n```python\n# Moles of each gas component\nmoles_H2O = 0.20\nmoles_N2O = 0.05\nmoles_N2 = 0.05\n\n# Molar masses\nM_H2O = 18.015  # g/mol\nM_N2O = 44.013  # g/mol (14.007*2 + 15.999)\nM_N2 = 28.014   # g/mol (14.007*2)\n\n# Calculate mass of each component\nmass_H2O = moles_H2O * M_H2O\nmass_N2O = moles_N2O * M_N2O\nmass_N2 = moles_N2 * M_N2\n\n# Calculate total mass\ntotal_mass = mass_H2O + mass_N2O + mass_N2\n\nprint(f\"Calculated total mass = {total_mass:.2f} g\")\nprint(f\"Initial mass of salts = 7.20 g\")\n```\n\n*   **Result:**\n    *   Calculated total mass = 7.20 g\n    *   Initial mass of salts = 7.20 g\n    *   The mass matches perfectly. The decomposition products are confirmed to be 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.05 mol N₂O, and 0.05 mol N₂.\n\n*   **Plan Refinement:**\n    1.  We need to find two equimolar salts, A and B, that decompose to yield this product ratio. Common ammonium salts decompose to these products.\n    2.  Consider the thermal decomposition of ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite:\n        *   `NH₄NO₃(s) -> N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)`\n        *   `NH₄NO₂(s) -> N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)`\n    3.  If we have an equimolar mixture, let's say `n` moles of each salt, the products would be `n` moles of N₂O, `n` moles of N₂, and `2n + 2n = 4n` moles of H₂O.\n    4.  Our experimental results are 0.05 mol N₂O, 0.05 mol N₂, and 0.20 mol H₂O.\n    5.  Comparing the theoretical ratio (`n`:`n`:`4n`) to the experimental results (0.05:0.05:0.20), we see they match perfectly if `n = 0.05` mol.\n    6.  Therefore, the salts are A = NH₄NO₃ and B = NH₄NO₂. The final step is to count the atoms in their formulas.\n\n*   **Action:** Count the total number of atoms in the formulas NH₄NO₃ and NH₄NO₂.\n\n```python\n# Salt A is Ammonium Nitrate: NH4NO3\n# Atoms in NH4NO3 = (1 N + 4 H) + (1 N + 3 O) = 2 N + 4 H + 3 O\natoms_A = 2 + 4 + 3\n\n# Salt B is Ammonium Nitrite: NH4NO2\n# Atoms in NH4NO2 = (1 N + 4 H) + (1 N + 2 O) = 2 N + 4 H + 2 O\natoms_B = 2 + 4 + 2\n\n# Total number of atoms\ntotal_atoms = atoms_A + atoms_B\n\nprint(f\"Atoms in NH4NO3 (Salt A) = {atoms_A}\")\nprint(f\"Atoms in NH4NO2 (Salt B) = {atoms_B}\")\nprint(f\"Total atoms in A and B = {total_atoms}\")\n```\n\n*   **Result:**\n    *   Atoms in NH₄NO₃ (Salt A) = 9\n    *   Atoms in NH₄NO₂ (Salt B) = 8\n    *   Total atoms in A and B = 17\n\n*   **Final Answer:** The analysis has confirmed the salts are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃, 9 atoms) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂, 8 atoms). The total number of atoms in the two salt formulas is 9 + 8 = 17. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",

Based on the product mixture, identify the two equimolar salts (A and B) and verify the stoichiometry.\n    4.  Count the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of salts A and B.\n\n*   **Action:** Calculate the moles of H₂O, O atoms, and gas C from the given experimental data.\n\n```python\n# Molar mass of H2O = 18.015 g/mol\n# Molar mass of O = 15.999 g/mol\n# Molar volume of a gas at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP) = 22.4 L/mol\n\n# Given data\nmass_H2O = 3.60  # g (from tube №1)\nmass_O = 0.80    # g (from tube №3, as CuO)\nvolume_C = 2.24  # L (at STP)\n\n# Calculate moles\nmoles_H2O = mass_H2O / 18.015\nmoles_O_atoms = mass_O / 15.999\nmoles_gas_C = volume_C / 22.4\n\nprint(f\"Moles of H2O = {moles_H2O:.4f} mol\")\nprint(f\"Moles of O atoms = {moles_O_atoms:.4f} mol\")\nprint(f\"Moles of gas C = {moles_gas_C:.4f} mol\")\n```\n\n*   **Result:**\n    *   Moles of H₂O ≈ 0.200 mol\n    *   Moles of O atoms ≈ 0.050 mol\n    *   Moles of gas C ≈ 0.100 mol\n\n*   **Plan Refinement:**\n    1.  The products are 0.20 mol H₂O, an oxidizing gas that provided 0.05 mol of O atoms, and 0.10 mol of an inert gas C. The lack of reaction with Ca(OH)₂ confirms no acidic gases (like CO₂) are present.\n    2.  The oxidizing gas reacted with hot copper. A likely candidate is nitrous oxide (N₂O). The reaction is `N₂O + Cu -> N₂ + CuO`. This shows 1 mole of N₂O provides 1 mole of O atoms. Therefore, the amount of N₂O was 0.05 mol.\n    3.  This reaction also produces 0.05 mol of N₂. The final gas C (0.10 mol) is inert, likely N₂. This total amount of N₂ is the sum of the N₂ produced from N₂O and any N₂ that was in the original gas mixture. So, initial N₂ = 0.10 mol (total) - 0.05 mol (from N₂O) = 0.05 mol.\n    4.  The decomposition products were: 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.05 mol N₂O, and 0.05 mol N₂. Let's verify this by checking the total mass.\n\n*   **Action:** Calculate the total mass of the deduced gas mixture (0.20 mol H₂O, 0.05 mol N₂O, 0.05 mol N₂) and compare it to the initial 7.20 g.\n\n```python\n# Moles of each gas\nmoles_H2O = 0.20\nmoles_N2O = 0.05\nmoles_N2 = 0.05\n\n# Molar masses (g/mol)\nM_H2O = 18.015\nM_N2O = 44.013\nM_N2 = 28.014\n\n# Calculate total mass\ntotal_mass = (moles_H2O * M_H2O) + (moles_N2O * M_N2O) + (moles_N2 * M_N2)\n\nprint(f\"Calculated total mass = {total_mass:.2f} g\")\nprint(f\"Initial mass of salts = 7.20 g\")\n```\n\n*   **Result:**\n    *   Calculated total mass = 7.20 g\n    *   Initial mass of salts = 7.20 g\n    *   The mass balance is correct. The decomposition products are confirmed.\n\n*   **Plan Refinement:**\n    1.  We need to find two equimolar salts that decompose to produce 0.05 mol N₂, 0.05 mol N₂O, and 0.20 mol H₂O.\n    2.  Consider the decomposition of common ammonium salts:\n        *   `NH₄NO₃(s) -> N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)`\n        *   `NH₄NO₂(s) -> N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)`\n    3.  If we start with an equimolar mixture of `n` moles of each, we get `n` mol N₂O, `n` mol N₂, and `2n + 2n = 4n` mol H₂O. The product ratio is `N₂ : N₂O : H₂O = n : n : 4n = 1 : 1 : 4`.\n    4.  Our experimental results are 0.05 mol N₂ : 0.05 mol N₂O : 0.20 mol H₂O, which is a ratio of 1:1:4.\n    5.  The hypothesis is correct. The salts are ammonium nitrate (A) and ammonium nitrite (B). The final step is to count the atoms in their formulas.\n\n*   **Action:** Count the total number of atoms in the formulas NH₄NO₃ and NH₄NO₂.\n\n```python\n# Salt A: Ammonium Nitrate (NH4NO3)\n# Atoms = 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen\natoms_A = 2 + 4 + 3\n\n# Salt B: Ammonium Nitrite (NH4NO2)\n# Atoms = 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen\natoms_B = 2 + 4 + 2\n\n# Total atoms in both salts\ntotal_atoms = atoms_A + atoms_B\n\nprint(f\"Atoms in NH4NO3 = {atoms_A}\")\nprint(f\"Atoms in NH4NO2 = {atoms_B}\")\nprint(f\"Total atoms = {total_atoms}\")\n```\n\n*   **Result:**\n    *   Atoms in NH₄NO₃ = 9\n    *   Atoms in NH₄NO₂ = 8\n    *   Total atoms = 17\n\n*   **Final Answer:** The analysis has shown the salts to be ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).

The products are ~0.20 mol H₂O, an oxidizing gas that supplied 0.05 mol of O atoms, and 0.10 mol of an inert gas C. The inert gas C is likely N₂.\n    2.  The oxidizing gas reacted with hot copper (`Cu + [O] -> CuO`). A common nitrogen-based oxidizing gas from decomposition is N₂O. The reaction `N₂O + Cu -> N₂ + CuO` shows that 1 mole of N₂O provides 1 mole of O atoms. Therefore, the amount of N₂O must have been 0.05 mol.\n    3.  This reaction also produces 0.05 mol of N₂. The final gas C (0.10 mol N₂) is the sum of this produced N₂ and any N₂ present in the initial gas mixture. Therefore, initial N₂ = 0.10 mol (total) - 0.05 mol (from N₂O) = 0.05 mol.\n    4.

The decomposition of ammonium nitrate (`NH₄NO₃ -> N₂O + 2H₂O`) and ammonium nitrite (`NH₄NO₂ -> N₂ + 2H₂O`) fit these products.\n    3.  If we have an equimolar mixture of `n` moles each, the products are `n` mol N₂O, `n` mol N₂, and `4n` mol H₂O. The molar ratio is 1:1:4.\n    4.  Our experimental results (0.05 mol N₂O : 0.05 mol N₂ : 0.20 mol H₂O) perfectly match the 1:1:4 ratio, with `n = 0.05` mol.\n    5.  Thus, the salts are NH₄NO₃ and NH₄NO₂. The final step is to count the atoms in their formulas.\n\n*   **Action:** Count the total number of atoms in the formulas NH₄NO₃ and NH₄NO₂.\n\n```python\n# Salt A is Ammonium Nitrate: NH4NO3\n# Number of atoms in NH4NO3 = 2 N + 4 H + 3 O\natoms_A = 2 + 4 + 3\n\n# Salt B is Ammonium Nitrite: NH4NO2\n# Number of atoms in NH4NO2 = 2 N + 4 H + 2 O\natoms_B = 2 + 4 + 2\n\n# Total number of atoms in both salt formulas\ntotal_atoms = atoms_A + atoms_B\n\nprint(f\"Atoms in NH4NO3 = {atoms_A}\")\nprint(f\"Atoms in NH4NO2 = {atoms_B}\")\nprint(f\"Total atoms = {total_atoms}\")\n```\n\n*   **Result:**\n    *   Atoms in NH₄NO₃ = 9\n    *   Atoms in NH₄NO₂ = 8\n    *   Total atoms = 17\n\n*   **Final Answer:** The logical deduction confirmed that the salts are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).

    "*   **Plan:**\n    1.  Calculate the moles of the gaseous products based on the mass changes in the absorption tubes and the volume of the final gas.\n    2.  Identify the chemical nature of the gases produced and verify the composition by checking the mass balance.\n    3.  Deduce the identities of the two equimolar salts, A and B, that would decompose to form this specific mixture of gases.\n    4.  Count the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of salts A and B.\n\n*   **Action:** Calculate the moles of water (H₂O) absorbed, the moles of oxygen atoms that reacted with copper, and the moles of the final gas C.\n\n```python\n# Molar mass of H2O = 18.015 g/mol\n# Molar mass of O = 15.999 g/mol\n# Molar volume of a gas at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP) = 22.4 L/mol\n\n# Given data from the problem\nmass_increase_tube1 = 3.60  # g, corresponds to mass of H2O\nmass_increase_tube3 = 0.80    # g, corresponds to mass of O in CuO\nvolume_gas_C = 2.24  # L at STP\n\n# Calculate moles of each component\nmoles_H2O = mass_increase_tube1 / 18.015\nmoles_O_atoms = mass_increase_tube3 / 15.999\nmoles_gas_C = volume_gas_C / 22.4\n\nprint(f\"Moles of H2O = {moles_H2O:.4f} mol\")\nprint(f\"Moles of O atoms = {moles_O_atoms:.4f} mol\")\nprint(f\"Moles of gas C = {moles_gas_C:.4f} mol\")\n```\n\n*   **Result:**\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 0.1998 mol (approx. 0.20 mol)\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.0500 mol\n    *   Moles of gas C = 0.1000 mol\n\n*   **Plan Refinement:**\n    1.  The products are ~0.20 mol H₂O, an oxidizing gas that supplied 0.05 mol of O atoms, and 0.10 mol of an inert gas C. The inert gas C is likely N₂.\n    2.  The oxidizing gas reacted with hot copper (`Cu + [O] -> CuO`). A common nitrogen-based oxidizing gas from decomposition is N₂O. The reaction `N₂O + Cu -> N₂ + CuO` shows that 1 mole of N₂O provides 1 mole of O atoms. Therefore, the amount of N₂O must have been 0.05 mol.\n    3.  This reaction also produces 0.05 mol of N₂. The final gas C (0.10 mol N₂) is the sum of this produced N₂ and any N₂ present in the initial gas mixture. Therefore, initial N₂ = 0.10 mol (total) - 0.05 mol (from N₂O) = 0.05 mol.\n    4.  The initial gas mixture was: 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.05 mol N₂O, and 0.05 mol N₂. Let's verify this by checking if the total mass equals the starting 7.20 g.\n\n*   **Action:** Calculate the total mass of the deduced gas mixture (0.20 mol H₂O, 0.05 mol N₂O, 0.05 mol N₂).\n\n```python\n# Moles of each gas component (using rounded values for clarity)\nmoles_H2O = 0.20\nmoles_N2O = 0.05\nmoles_N2 = 0.05\n\n# Molar masses (g/mol)\nM_H2O = 18.015\nM_N2O = 44.013  # 2*14.007 + 15.999\nM_N2 = 28.014   # 2*14.007\n\n# Calculate the mass of each component and the total mass\nmass_H2O = moles_H2O * M_H2O\nmass_N2O = moles_N2O * M_N2O\nmass_N2 = moles_N2 * M_N2\ntotal_mass = mass_H2O + mass_N2O + mass_N2\n\nprint(f\"Calculated total mass = {total_mass:.2f} g\")\nprint(f\"Initial mass of salts = 7.20 g\")\n```\n\n*   **Result:**\n    *   Calculated total mass = 7.20 g\n    *   Initial mass of salts = 7.20 g\n    *   The mass balance is correct, confirming the identity and amounts of the gaseous products.\n\n*   **Plan Refinement:**\n    1.  We need to find two equimolar salts that decompose to yield 0.05 mol N₂, 0.05 mol N₂O, and 0.20 mol H₂O.\n    2.  The decomposition of ammonium nitrate (`NH₄NO₃ -> N₂O + 2H₂O`) and ammonium nitrite (`NH₄NO₂ -> N₂ + 2H₂O`) fit these products.\n    3.  If we have an equimolar mixture of `n` moles each, the products are `n` mol N₂O, `n` mol N₂, and `4n` mol H₂O. The molar ratio is 1:1:4.\n    4.
