def check_smeft_symmetry_answer():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the answer to the question about
    required symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT).

    The logic is based on the fundamental principles of SMEFT construction:
    1.  Poincare Invariance: SMEFT is built as a Poincare-invariant theory.
        This includes both Lorentz invariance (1) and translational invariance.
        Therefore, both Lorentz (1) and Poincare (2) symmetries must be respected.
    2.  CPT Invariance: The CPT theorem applies to any local, Lorentz-invariant
        Quantum Field Theory. Since SMEFT adheres to these principles, it must
        respect CPT symmetry (4).
    3.  CP Violation: The Standard Model itself violates CP symmetry. SMEFT is
        a framework that parameterizes possible new physics, including new
        sources of CP violation. Therefore, CP symmetry (3) is NOT a required
        symmetry for all operators in the SMEFT.

    Conclusion: The required symmetries are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4).
