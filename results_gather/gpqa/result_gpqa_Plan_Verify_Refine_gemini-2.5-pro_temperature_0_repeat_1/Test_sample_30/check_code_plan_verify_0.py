    # --- Step 1: Nitration of Toluene ---

    # --- Step 2: Oxidation of Product 1 ---
    # p-nitrotoluene is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4.
    # While strong oxidants (like KMnO4) would form a carboxylic acid,
    # MnO2 is a milder reagent often used to selectively oxidize benzylic positions to aldehydes.
    # This is a key insight correctly identified by the LLM.
    reactant_2 = product_1
    product_2 = "p-nitrobenzaldehyde"  # 4-nitrobenzaldehyde

    # --- Step 3: Condensation Reaction ---
    # p-nitrobenzaldehyde reacts with acetone in aqueous NaOH.
    # This is a base-catalyzed double crossed-aldol condensation (Claisen-Schmidt condensation).
    # Two molecules of the aldehyde react with one molecule of acetone.

    # --- Step 4: Symmetry Analysis of Product 3 ---
    # We need to determine the molecular point group of the final product.
    # We can store the point groups of relevant molecules in a dictionary.
    # The most stable isomer of product_3 is the planar trans,trans-isomer.

    # The double condensation is a very common reaction and leads to a more symmetric molecule,
    # making it the most plausible intended product in this context.
