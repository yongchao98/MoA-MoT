def check_transit_probability_answer():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the LLM's answer regarding transit probabilities.

    The transit probability (p_transit) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:
    p_transit = R_star / a
    where R_star is the star's radius and 'a' is the planet's semi-major axis.

    From Kepler's Third Law, for a planet with mass << star mass:
    P^2 ∝ a^3 / M_star
    Rearranging for 'a':
    a ∝ (M_star * P^2)^(1/3)

    Substituting 'a' into the probability formula:
    p_transit ∝ R_star / (M_star * P^2)^(1/3)

    We need to find the ratio p1 / p2.
