def check_cre_lox_frameshift():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer by simulating the molecular genetics
    described in the problem.

    The function verifies the following points:
    1.  The length of a lox site (lox2272 in this case) is 34 bp.
    2.  After Cre-mediated recombination, a single lox site "scar" remains.
    3.  A functional protein requires the reading frame to be maintained, meaning any
        insertion between coding sequences must have a length divisible by 3 (the codon size).
    4.  It checks if the lox scar length (34 bp) causes a frameshift.
    5.  It evaluates the chosen answer ('C') based on this biological fact and confirms
        that the reasoning for dismissing other options is sound.

    # A) The enhancer is missing.
    # The question states a CBA promoter is used. CBA (Chicken Beta-Actin promoter with CMV enhancer)
    # is a strong, ubiquitous promoter. It's highly unlikely to be "missing" or non-functional.
    # Dismissing this option is correct.

    # B) The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi.
    # While a possible issue for any transmembrane protein, the frameshift is a guaranteed
    # failure based on the construct's design. A design flaw is a more direct and certain
    # cause than a potential biological trafficking issue. Dismissing this as the *most likely*
    # reason is correct.

    # D) Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship.
    # This describes the biological interaction between the cells expressing the proteins,
    # not the intracellular mechanism of protein synthesis. It does not explain why the
    # eGFP reporter failed to be produced. Dismissing this option is correct.

    # --- Final Conclusion ---
    # The frameshift is the most direct and certain explanation for the lack of eGFP signal.
    # This matches the reasoning for answer C.
