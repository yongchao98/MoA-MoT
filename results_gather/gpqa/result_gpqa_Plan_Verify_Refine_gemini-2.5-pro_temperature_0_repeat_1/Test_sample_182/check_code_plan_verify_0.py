    Checks the correctness of the IHD calculation for the given reaction product.

    The reaction is: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid + Red P/HI (excess) -> Product

    This function will:
    1. Determine the number of carbon atoms in the reactant.
    2. Understand the reaction: Red P/HI causes complete reduction to a saturated cycloalkane.
    3. Determine the molecular formula of the product.

    # Step 1: Determine the carbon count of the reactant.
    # The carbon skeleton is preserved during the reaction.
    # Reactant: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid
    # - cyclohex: 6 carbons in the ring
    # - formyl (-CHO): 1 carbon
    # - vinyl (-CH=CH2): 2 carbons
    # - carboxylic acid (-COOH): 1 carbon
    total_carbons = 6 + 1 + 2 + 1

    # Step 2: Understand the reaction and determine the product's structure.
    # The reagent combination of Red Phosphorus and excess HI is a powerful reducing agent.
    # It reduces all C=C and C=O bonds and removes all oxygen atoms.
    # - The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring.
    # - The vinyl group becomes an ethyl group.
    # - The formyl group becomes a methyl group.
    # - The carboxylic acid group becomes a methyl group.
    # The final product is a saturated monocyclic alkane (a substituted cyclohexane).

    # Step 3: Determine the molecular formula of the product.
    # The general formula for a saturated monocyclic alkane is C_n H_{2n}.
    # Since the product has 'total_carbons' number of carbon atoms and is a single ring structure:
    product_carbons = total_carbons
    product_hydrogens = 2 * total_carbons
    # The product formula is C10H20.

    # Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) for the product.
    # IHD can be calculated in two ways:
    # Method A: Using the formula IHD = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1 (for C, H, N, O, X)
    # For a hydrocarbon C_x H_y, the formula simplifies to IHD = x - y/2 + 1.
    # calculated_ihd_formula = product_carbons - (product_hydrogens / 2) + 1
    
    # Method B: By counting rings and pi bonds in the structure.
    # The product is a saturated monocyclic alkane (substituted cyclohexane).
    num_rings = 1
    num_pi_bonds = 0
    calculated_ihd_structure = num_rings + num_pi_bonds

    # Both methods should yield the same result. Let's use the structural method as it's more direct.
    calculated_ihd = calculated_ihd_structure

    # Step 5: Compare with the provided answer.
    # The question's option D corresponds to an IHD of 1.

                f"The reactant has {total_carbons} carbons, so the product is a C{product_carbons}H{product_hydrogens} cycloalkane. "
