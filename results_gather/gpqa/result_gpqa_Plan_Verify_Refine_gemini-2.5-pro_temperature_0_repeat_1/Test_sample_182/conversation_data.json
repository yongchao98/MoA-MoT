    "The user wants to find the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product of a specific chemical reaction.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Identify the structure of the reactant: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n2.  Determine the effect of the reagents (Red Phosphorus and excess HI) on the reactant's functional groups and points of unsaturation.\n3.  Deduce the structure of the final product.\n4.  Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency for the product.\n\n**Execution:**\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reactant and Reagents**\n*   **Reactant:** 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n    *   This molecule contains a six-membered carbon ring (cyclohex).\n    *   It has a double bond within the ring (`-3-ene`).\n    *   It has a vinyl group (-CH=CH₂), which contains another double bond.\n    *   It has a formyl group (-CHO), which contains a C=O double bond.\n    *   It has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which contains a C=O double bond.\n*   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus and excess of HI.\n    *   This combination is a powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. It reduces aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, and alcohols completely to alkanes. It also saturates all carbon-carbon double and triple bonds.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Product**\nThe reaction will reduce all functional groups and points of unsaturation:\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The formyl group (-CHO) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The vinyl group's double bond (-CH=CH₂) will be reduced to an ethyl group (-CH₂-CH₃).\n*   The double bond in the cyclohexene ring will be reduced to a single bond, converting the ring to cyclohexane.\n\nThe carbon skeleton remains the same. The product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with two methyl groups and one ethyl group. The specific name would be 5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane. This is a saturated cycloalkane.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)**\nThe IHD (or degree of unsaturation) is a count of the number of rings and pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n*   **IHD = (Number of Rings) + (Number of π bonds)**\n\nFor the product, 5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane:\n*   **Number of Rings:** 1 (the cyclohexane ring).\n*   **Number of π bonds:** 0 (all double bonds from the reactant have been saturated/reduced).\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the product is 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
