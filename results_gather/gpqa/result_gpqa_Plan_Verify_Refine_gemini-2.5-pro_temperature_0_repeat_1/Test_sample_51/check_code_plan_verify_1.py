    This function checks the correctness of the LLM's answer by:
    1. Verifying the physical model and formulas used are appropriate for the problem.

    # --- Step 1: Define constants and parameters from the question ---
    # Physical constants
    h = 6.62607015e-34  # Planck's constant in JÂ·s
    c = 2.99792458e8    # Speed of light in m/s
    k = 1.380649e-23     # Boltzmann constant in J/K

    # Parameters from the question
    T_nospots = 6000.0  # Temperature without spots in Kelvin
    T_spots = 5500.0    # Temperature with spots in Kelvin
    wavelength_A = 1448.0 # Wavelength in Angstroms
    wavelength_m = wavelength_A * 1e-10 # Convert wavelength to meters

    # The LLM correctly ignored irrelevant information such as stellar radius, mass,
    # and spot coverage percentage, as the effective temperatures were directly provided.

    # --- Step 2: Verify the physical model and formula ---
    # The question assumes LTE, so the Boltzmann equation is the correct model.
    # The ratio of populations (n2/n1) is R = (g2/g1) * exp(-delta_E / (k*T)).
    # The question asks for the factor F = R_nospots / R_spots.
    # F = [ (g2/g1) * exp(-delta_E / (k*T_nospots)) ] / [ (g2/g1) * exp(-delta_E / (k*T_spots)) ]
    # The statistical weight ratio (g2/g1) cancels out.
    # F = exp( (delta_E / k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) )
    # The formula used by the LLM is correct.
