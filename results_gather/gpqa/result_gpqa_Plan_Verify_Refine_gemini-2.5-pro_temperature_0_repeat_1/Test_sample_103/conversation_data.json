    "My plan is to relate the observed wavelength shift to the star's radial velocity, then connect the radial velocity to the planet's orbital period, and finally calculate the ratio of the two periods.\n\n*   **Step 1:** Relate the wavelength shift (Δλ) to the star's radial velocity amplitude (K). The Doppler shift formula shows that Δλ is directly proportional to the velocity, so the ratio of the velocity amplitudes (K₂/K₁) is equal to the ratio of the wavelength shifts (Δλ₂/Δλ₁).\n*   **Step 2:** Use the formula for the radial velocity amplitude (K) to find its relationship with the orbital period (T). Given that the star masses and planet masses are the same, K is proportional to T⁻¹/³.\n*   **Step 3:** Combine the relationships from the first two steps to solve for the ratio of the orbital periods (T₂/T₁).\n\nThe periodic wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's maximum radial velocity (the amplitude K).\nTherefore, the ratio of the velocity amplitudes is:\nK₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 miliangstrom / 5 miliangstrom = 1.4\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity amplitude K is given by:\nK = (2πG / T)^(1/3) * (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) * sin(i)\nwhere T is the orbital period, M_p is the planet's mass, M_star is the star's mass, G is the gravitational constant, and i is the orbital inclination.\n\nSince the star masses are the same (M_star1 = M_star2) and the planet masses are the same (M_p1 = M_p2), and assuming the inclination `i` is comparable for both systems, we can see the relationship between K and T:\nK ∝ T⁻¹/³\n\nNow we can set up a ratio:\nK₂ / K₁ = (T₂)⁻¹/³ / (T₁)⁻¹/³ = (T₁ / T₂)^¹/³\n\nWe already found that K₂ / K₁ = 1.4.\n1.4 = (T₁ / T₂)^¹/³\n\nTo find the ratio of the periods, we first solve for T₁ / T₂ by cubing both sides:\nT₁ / T₂ = (1.4)³\n\nThe question asks for how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which is the ratio T₂ / T₁.\nT₂ / T₁ = 1 / (T₁ / T₂) = 1 / (1.4)³\n\nNow, I will calculate the final value.\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio of the periods T2 / T1\nratio_T2_T1 = 1 / (1.4)**3\nprint(f\"{ratio_T2_T1:.4f}\")\n```\nThe calculation shows that the ratio T₂ / T₁ is approximately 0.3644. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the final answer.\n\nThe relationship between the periodic wavelength shift (Δλ) and the star's radial velocity amplitude (K) is linear, meaning Δλ ∝ K. Therefore, the ratio of the velocity amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the wavelength shifts:\nK₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 miliangstrom / 5 miliangstrom = 1.4\n\nThe formula for the radial velocity amplitude K for a planet in a circular orbit is:\nK = (2πG / T)^(1/3) * (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) * sin(i)\n\nIn this problem, the star masses (M_star) are the same, and the planet masses (M_p) are the same. Assuming the orbital inclinations (i) are similar, we can establish a proportionality between K and the orbital period T:\nK ∝ T⁻¹/³\n\nUsing this proportionality, we can write the ratio of the velocity amplitudes in terms of the periods:\nK₂ / K₁ = (T₂)⁻¹/³ / (T₁)⁻¹/³ = (T₁ / T₂)^¹/³\n\nNow we can equate the two expressions for the ratio K₂ / K₁:\n1.4 = (T₁ / T₂)^¹/³\n\nTo find the ratio of the periods, we first cube both sides of the equation:\n(1.4)³ = T₁ / T₂\n2.744 = T₁ / T₂\n\nThe question asks for how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which is the ratio T₂ / T₁. We can find this by taking the reciprocal:\nT₂ / T₁ = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
