    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Conservation Laws:** I will apply the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum to the electron-positron annihilation.\n2.  **Calculations:** I will calculate the total initial energy and the net initial momentum of the system. Then, I'll determine the energy and momentum of the resulting photons.\n3.  **Trigonometry:** Using the conservation of momentum in the x-direction, I will derive an expression for the angle of the photons relative to the horizontal axis.\n4.  **Final Angle:** I will calculate the total angle between the two photons and select the closest answer.\n\nFirst, I will calculate the total energy and momentum of the initial system (electron and positron). I will use units where the rest mass of the electron `m_e` and the speed of light `c` are equal to 1, as these constants will cancel out in the final calculation for the angle.\n\nThe energy of a particle is given by `E = γmc^2` and its momentum by `p = sqrt(γ^2 - 1)mc`.\n\n*   Electron: `γ_e = 4`\n*   Positron: `γ_p = 2`\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Lorentz factors\ngamma_e = 4  # electron\ngamma_p = 2  # positron\n\n# Let m_e = 1 and c = 1 for simplicity\n\n# Initial Energies\nE_e = gamma_e  # E = gamma * m * c^2\nE_p = gamma_p\nE_total_initial = E_e + E_p\n\n# Initial Momenta (along x-axis)\n# Electron moves right (+x), positron moves left (-x)\np_e = np.sqrt(gamma_e**2 - 1) # p = sqrt(gamma^2 - 1) * m * c\np_p = -np.sqrt(gamma_p**2 - 1)\np_total_initial_x = p_e + p_p\n\nprint(f\"Total Initial Energy: {E_total_initial}\")\nprint(f\"Total Initial Momentum (x-component): {p_total_initial_x}\")\n```\nThe system has a total initial energy and momentum. Now, I will use the conservation laws to relate these initial values to the properties of the two photons produced after the annihilation.\n\nThe problem states the two photons have equal energy.\n*   `E_total_initial = E_photon1 + E_photon2 = 2 * E_photon`\n*   `p_total_initial_x = p_photon1_x + p_photon2_x`\n\nFor a photon, `E = pc`. Let `θ` be the angle of each photon with the horizontal axis. Since one is upper-right and the other is lower-right, their angles are `+θ` and `-θ`.\n\n*   `p_photon1_x = p_photon * cos(θ)`\n*   `p_photon2_x = p_photon * cos(-θ) = p_photon * cos(θ)`\n\nTherefore, `p_total_initial_x = 2 * p_photon * cos(θ)`.\n\nI can now calculate the energy and momentum of a single photon and then solve for the angle `θ`.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Values from the previous step\nE_total_initial = 6.0\np_total_initial_x = 2.138089935299395\n\n# Let c = 1\n# Energy of a single photon\nE_photon = E_total_initial / 2\n\n# Momentum of a single photon (since E = pc, and c=1, p = E)\np_photon = E_photon\n\n# From conservation of momentum: p_total_initial_x = 2 * p_photon * cos(theta)\n# cos(theta) = p_total_initial_x / (2 * p_photon)\ncos_theta = p_total_initial_x / (2 * p_photon)\n\n# Calculate theta in degrees\ntheta_rad = np.arccos(cos_theta)\ntheta_deg = np.degrees(theta_rad)\n\n# The total angle between the photons is 2 * theta\ntotal_angle = 2 * theta_deg\n\nprint(f\"Energy of one photon: {E_photon}\")\nprint(f\"Momentum of one photon: {p_photon}\")\nprint(f\"cos(theta): {cos_theta}\")\nprint(f\"Angle theta (degrees): {theta_deg}\")\nprint(f\"Total angle between photons (2*theta): {total_angle}\")\n```\nThe calculated total angle between the two photons is approximately 138.19 degrees. This value is very close to option B.\n\nFinal check of the logic:\n1.  Energy is conserved: `(γ_e + γ_p)mc^2 = 2 * E_ph`.\n2.  Momentum is conserved: `(sqrt(γ_e^2 - 1) - sqrt(γ_p^2 - 1))mc = 2 * p_ph * cos(θ)`.\n3.  For a photon, `E_ph = p_ph * c`.\n4.  Substituting (3) into (1): `(γ_e + γ_p)mc^2 = 2 * p_ph * c`. This gives `p_ph = (γ_e + γ_p)m*c / 2`.\n5.  Substituting this `p_ph` into (2): `(sqrt(γ_e^2 - 1) - sqrt(γ_p^2 - 1))mc = 2 * [(γ_e + γ_p)mc / 2] * cos(θ)`.\n6.  Simplifying gives `cos(θ) = (sqrt(γ_e^2 - 1) - sqrt(γ_p^2 - 1)) / (γ_e + γ_p)`.\n7.  Plugging in `γ_e = 4` and `γ_p = 2`: `cos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6 ≈ 0.356`.\n8.  `θ = arccos(0.356) ≈ 69.1` degrees.\n9.  The total angle is `2θ ≈ 138.2` degrees.\n\nThe calculation is robust. The closest answer is 138.\n\n<<<B>>>",
