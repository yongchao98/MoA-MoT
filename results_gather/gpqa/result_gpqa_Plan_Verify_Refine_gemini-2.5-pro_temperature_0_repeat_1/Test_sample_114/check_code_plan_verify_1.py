    # --- Step 1: Calculate Initial State ---
    # We use natural units where the rest mass of the electron (m_e) and the speed of light (c) are 1.
    # Energy: E = γmc² = γ
    # Momentum: p = sqrt(γ² - 1)mc = sqrt(γ² - 1)

    # --- Step 2: Apply Conservation Laws to the Final State (2 photons) ---
    # The problem states the two photons have equal energy.
    # By conservation of energy, the total final energy equals the total initial energy.

    # The photons move symmetrically at angles +theta and -theta to the horizontal axis.
    # The y-components of their momenta cancel out, satisfying conservation of momentum in the y-direction.

    # p_total_initial_x = p_photon * cos(theta) + p_photon * cos(theta)
    # p_total_initial_x = 2 * p_photon * cos(theta)

    # --- Step 3: Solve for the Angle ---
    # We can now solve for cos(theta)
