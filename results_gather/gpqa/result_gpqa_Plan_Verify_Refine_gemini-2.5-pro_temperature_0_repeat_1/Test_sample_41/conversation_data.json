    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n*   First, I will establish the relationship between a planet's equilibrium temperature and its orbital semi-major axis.\n*   Next, I will use the given temperature ratios to calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes between Planet 3 and Planet 1.\n*   Finally, I will apply Kepler's Third Law, which relates the orbital period to the semi-major axis, to determine the ratio of the orbital periods (P3 / P1).\n\nI will now execute the first step of my plan. The information about mass, albedo, and the TTV method is not required for this calculation, as the relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital period for planets around the same star is independent of these factors when albedo is constant. The core relationships are T_eq ∝ 1/√a and P ∝ a^(3/2). I will combine these to find the final ratio in a single calculation.```python\nimport math\n\n# Given ratios\nT_eq1_over_T_eq2 = 1.4\nT_eq2_over_T_eq3 = 2.3\n\n# The relationship between equilibrium temperature (T_eq) and semi-major axis (a) is T_eq ∝ 1/sqrt(a).\n# Therefore, (T1/T2) = sqrt(a2/a1), which means (a2/a1) = (T1/T2)^2.\n# And (T2/T3) = sqrt(a3/a2), which means (a3/a2) = (T2/T3)^2.\n\n# Calculate the ratio of semi-major axes a3/a1\n# a3/a1 = (a3/a2) * (a2/a1)\na2_over_a1 = T_eq1_over_T_eq2**2\na3_over_a2 = T_eq2_over_T_eq3**2\na3_over_a1 = a3_over_a2 * a2_over_a1\n\n# Kepler's Third Law states that for planets orbiting the same star, P^2 ∝ a^3, or P ∝ a^(3/2).\n# Therefore, P3/P1 = (a3/a1)^(3/2).\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the orbital periods P3/P1\nP3_over_P1 = a3_over_a1**(3/2)\n\n# This can be simplified:\n# P3/P1 = ((T_eq2_over_T_eq3**2) * (T_eq1_over_T_eq2**2))**(3/2)\n# P3/P1 = (T_eq2_over_T_eq3**3) * (T_eq1_over_T_eq2**3)\nP3_over_P1_simplified = (T_eq2_over_T_eq3**3) * (T_eq1_over_T_eq2**3)\n\n\nprint(f\"The ratio of the orbital period of Planet3 to Planet1 is: {P3_over_P1_simplified}\")\n```The calculation is complete and has yielded a result.\n\n1.  **Relationship between Temperature and Semi-major Axis:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is proportional to the inverse square root of its semi-major axis (a), i.e., T_eq ∝ 1/√a. This means the ratio of semi-major axes is the square of the inverse ratio of temperatures: a₂/a₁ = (T₁/T₂)² and a₃/a₂ = (T₂/T₃)².\n\n2.  **Ratio of Semi-major Axes (a₃/a₁):** By combining the ratios, we get a₃/a₁ = (a₃/a₂) * (a₂/a₁) = (T₂/T₃)² * (T₁/T₂)².\n\n3.  **Kepler's Third Law:** The law states that the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a), or P ∝ a^(3/2). Therefore, the ratio of the orbital periods is P₃/P₁ = (a₃/a₁)^(3/2).\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:**\n    P₃/P₁ = [(T₂/T₃)² * (T₁/T₂)²]^(3/2)\n    P₃/P₁ = (T₂/T₃)³ * (T₁/T₂)³\n    P₃/P₁ = (2.3)³ * (1.4)³\n    P₃/P₁ ≈ 33.4\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately 33.4, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "My plan was to determine the relationship between equilibrium temperature, semi-major axis, and orbital period, and then use the given ratios to calculate the final answer.\n\n1.  **Relate Temperature and Semi-major Axis:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet in a circular orbit around a star is given by T_eq ∝ (1/√a), where 'a' is the semi-major axis (orbital radius). This means that the ratio of the semi-major axes is related to the inverse square of the temperature ratio.\n    *   a₂/a₁ = (T₁/T₂)²\n    *   a₃/a₂ = (T₂/T₃)²\n\n2.  **Relate Semi-major Axis and Orbital Period:** Kepler's Third Law states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a³), or P ∝ a^(3/2).\n    *   P₃/P₁ = (a₃/a₁)^(3/2)\n\n3.  **Combine the Ratios:** Now, I can substitute the relationships from step 1 into the equation from step 2.\n    *   First, find the ratio a₃/a₁:\n        a₃/a₁ = (a₃/a₂) * (a₂/a₁) = (T₂/T₃)² * (T₁/T₂)²\n    *   Now, find the period ratio P₃/P₁:\n        P₃/P₁ = [(T₂/T₃)² * (T₁/T₂)²]^(3/2)\n        P₃/P₁ = (T₂/T₃)³ * (T₁/T₂)³\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Value:** Using the given temperature ratios:\n    *   T₁/T₂ = 1.4\n    *   T₂/T₃ = 2.3\n    *   P₃/P₁ = (2.3)³ * (1.4)³ = 12.167 * 2.744 ≈ 33.386\n\nThe result is approximately 33.4. The information about the masses, albedo (since it's equal for all planets), and the TTV method is extraneous to this specific calculation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
