    # --- Physics Principles ---
    # 1. Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq) vs. Semi-major Axis (a):
    # For planets around the same star with the same albedo, T_eq is proportional to 1/sqrt(a).
    # This means a is proportional to 1/(T_eq^2).
    # Therefore, a_x / a_y = (T_y / T_x)^2.

    # 2. Kepler's Third Law:
    # Orbital Period (P) vs. Semi-major Axis (a):
    # P^2 is proportional to a^3, which means P is proportional to a^(3/2).
    # Therefore, P_x / P_y = (a_x / a_y)^(3/2).

    # --- Calculation ---
    # We want to find P3 / P1.
    # P3 / P1 = (a3 / a1)^(3/2)

    # First, find the ratio a3 / a1:
    # a3 / a1 = (a3 / a2) * (a2 / a1)
    # Using the temperature relationship:
    # a3 / a2 = (T2 / T3)^2
    # a2 / a1 = (T1 / T2)^2
    # So, a3 / a1 = (T2 / T3)^2 * (T1 / T2)^2

    # Now substitute this back into the period ratio equation:
    # P3 / P1 = [ (T2 / T3)^2 * (T1 / T2)^2 ]^(3/2)
    # P3 / P1 = ( (T2 / T3) * (T1 / T2) )^(2 * 3/2)
    # P3 / P1 = ( (T2 / T3) * (T1 / T2) )^3
    # P3 / P1 = (T2 / T3)^3 * (T1 / T2)^3

    # Substitute the given numerical values:
    try:
        calculated_ratio = (T2_over_T3)**3 * (T1_over_T2)**3
