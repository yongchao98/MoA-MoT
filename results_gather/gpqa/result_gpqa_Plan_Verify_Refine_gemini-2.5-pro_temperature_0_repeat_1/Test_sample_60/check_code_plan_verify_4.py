    # --- Step 1: Nitration of Benzene ---
    # Benzene undergoes electrophilic aromatic substitution with a nitrating mixture (HNO3/H2SO4)
    # to form nitrobenzene.
    # We can represent the product by its substituents and their positions on the benzene ring.
    # Let's define the primary substituent at position 1.

    # --- Step 2: Bromination of Nitrobenzene ---
    # Nitrobenzene is brominated using Br2 and a Lewis acid catalyst (Fe forms FeBr3).
    # The nitro group (-NO2) is a strong deactivating group and a meta-director.
    # Therefore, the incoming bromine will be directed to the meta-position (C3 or C5).

    product_2_substituents['3'] = 'Br'
    product_2_name = "3-bromonitrobenzene"

    # --- Step 3: Reduction of the Nitro Group ---
    # Catalytic hydrogenation (H2, Pd/C) selectively reduces the nitro group (-NO2)
    # to an amino group (-NH2) without affecting the carbon-bromine bond.

    # --- Step 4: Diazotization ---
    # The primary aromatic amine (3-bromoaniline) is treated with NaNO2 and HBF4
    # to form a diazonium salt. This product is the precursor for the next step.
    # Product 4 is 3-bromobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate.
    # This will act as a source for the 3-bromophenyl radical in the next step.
    radical_source_substituents = {'3': 'Br'} # The diazonium group at C1 leaves.

    # --- Step 5: Gomberg-Bachmann Reaction ---
    # The diazonium salt is heated with anisole (methoxybenzene).
    # This is a Gomberg-Bachmann reaction, where the diazonium salt decomposes to a radical
    # (the 3-bromophenyl radical) that attacks the anisole ring.
    # The methoxy group (-OCH3) on anisole is an ortho, para-director.
    # Due to steric hindrance at the ortho position, the para-substituted product is major.
    # The new C-C bond forms between C1 of the first ring and C4 (para) of the anisole ring.
    # Naming the resulting biphenyl:
    # - The first ring has a bromine at position 3.
    # - The second (primed) ring has a methoxy group at position 4'.
