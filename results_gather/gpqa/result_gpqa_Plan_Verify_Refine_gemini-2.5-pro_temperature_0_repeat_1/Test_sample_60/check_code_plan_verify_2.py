        *   Step 3: The nitro group of Product 2 is reduced to an amine, forming 3-bromoaniline (Product 3).
        *   Step 4: 3-bromoaniline is treated with NaNO2/HBF4 to form the 3-bromobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate salt (Product 4).
        *   Step 5: Product 4 is heated with anisole. The diazonium salt decomposes to form a 3-bromophenyl radical. This radical attacks anisole. The methoxy group of anisole directs the attack to the para position.
        *   The final product is formed by joining the 3-bromophenyl group to the para-position of anisole. This gives 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl. This corresponds to option C.
