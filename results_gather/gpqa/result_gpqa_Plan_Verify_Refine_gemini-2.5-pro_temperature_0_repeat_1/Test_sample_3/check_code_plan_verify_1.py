def check_correctness_of_maxwell_equation_answer():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of an answer to a question about how
    Maxwell's equations would change if magnetic monopoles existed.

    The logic is based on the physical meaning of the equations:
    1. A magnetic monopole is a source of a magnetic field.
    2. The divergence of a vector field represents the density of its sources.
    3. In our universe, Gauss's Law for Magnetism (div(B) = 0) states there are no
       magnetic sources (monopoles).
    4. Therefore, if monopoles existed, this is the law that must be modified.
