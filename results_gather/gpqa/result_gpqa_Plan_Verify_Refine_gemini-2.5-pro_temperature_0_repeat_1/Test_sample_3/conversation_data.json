    "I have already provided the final answer. The checker feedback confirms that the answer <<<B>>> is correct.\n\nMy reasoning was as follows:\n1.  **Identify the relevant physical principle:** The question describes a universe with \"isolated North or South poles,\" which are known as magnetic monopoles.\n2.  **Consult Maxwell's Equations:** I recalled or looked up Maxwell's equations to see which one deals with magnetic monopoles.\n3.  **Analyze the Equations:**\n    *   Gauss's Law for Electricity (∇ ⋅ E = ρ / ε₀) relates the divergence of the electric field to electric charges (monopoles).\n    *   Gauss's Law for Magnetism (∇ ⋅ B = 0) states that the divergence of the magnetic field is zero. This is the mathematical statement that there are *no* magnetic monopoles.\n    *   Faraday's Law (∇ × E = -∂B/∂t) relates the curl of the electric field to a changing magnetic field.\n    *   Ampère-Maxwell Law (∇ × B = μ₀(J + ε₀ ∂E/∂t)) relates the curl of the magnetic field to currents and changing electric fields.\n4.  **Determine the necessary change:** If magnetic monopoles existed, they would be sources of the magnetic field, just as electric charges are sources of the electric field. This would require the divergence of the magnetic field to be non-zero. Therefore, Gauss's Law for Magnetism (∇ ⋅ B = 0) would have to be modified.\n5.  **Match with options:** Option B, \"The one related to the divergence of the magnetic field,\" perfectly describes Gauss's Law for Magnetism. The other options involve the curl of the fields, which are not directly modified by the simple existence of static magnetic charges.\n\nThis leads directly to the correct answer."

    "<information>### Maxwell's Equations in Differential Form: A Cornerstone of Electromagnetism\n\nMaxwell's equations are a set of four fundamental equations that form the bedrock of classical electromagnetism, optics, and electric circuits. In their differential form, these equations describe how electric and magnetic fields are generated and altered by each other and by charges and currents at any given point in space and time. They provide a complete description of the production and interrelation of electric and magnetic fields.\n\nThe four equations in differential form, using the metre-kilogram-second (mks) system, are:\n\n1.  **Gauss's Law for Electricity:** `div D = ρ`\n    This equation states that the electric field diverges from electric charges. It relates the divergence of the electric displacement field **D** to the electric charge density ρ.\n\n2.  **Gauss's Law for Magnetism:** `div B = 0`\n    This law asserts that there are no magnetic monopoles, meaning magnetic field lines always form closed loops. The divergence of the magnetic field **B** is always zero.\n\n3.  **Faraday's Law of Induction:** `curl E = -∂B/∂t`\n    This equation describes how a time-varying magnetic field **B** creates a circulating electric field **E**. This principle is the foundation for many electric generators.\n\n4.  **Ampère-Maxwell's Circuital Law:** `curl H = ∂D/∂t + J`\n    This law states that a circulating magnetic field, represented by **H**, is produced by either an electric current, given by the current density **J**, or by a time-varying electric displacement field **D**.\n\nIn these equations:\n*   **E** is the electric field.\n*   **B** is the magnetic field.\n*   **D** is the electric displacement field, which is proportional to **E**.\n*   **H** is the auxiliary magnetic field, proportional to **B**.\n*   ρ is the electric charge density.\n*   **J** is the electric current density.\n\nThese elegant equations not only unify the concepts of electricity and magnetism but also reveal the nature of light as an electromagnetic wave. They are fundamental to our understanding of the physical world and have enabled the development of numerous technologies.</information>\nChecker feedback:\noutput: Correct"
