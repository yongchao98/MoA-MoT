    "My plan is to determine the structure of the two compounds by predicting the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the possible options and then combining them in a 1:1 mixture to see which combination matches the experimental data.\n\n1.  **Predict Spectra:** I will first determine the expected 1H NMR signals (number, integration, multiplicity) for each of the four individual compounds based on their chemical structure and symmetry.\n2.  **Combine and Compare:** I will then systematically analyze each multiple-choice option. For each pair, I will combine their predicted spectra, assuming a 1:1 mixture, and compare the result to the observed spectrum given in the problem.\n3.  **Identify Match:** The pair whose combined spectrum matches the experimental data (two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio; three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio) will be the correct answer.\n```python\ndef predict_nmr(compound_name):\n    \"\"\"Predicts the 1H NMR signals for given aromatic compounds.\"\"\"\n    predictions = {\n        \"1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\": {\n            \"Aromatic Signals\": \"1 singlet (2H)\",\n            \"Aliphatic Signals\": \"1 singlet (12H)\",\n            \"Symmetry Note\": \"High symmetry (D2h).

    "My plan is to analyze the predicted NMR spectra for each compound and then evaluate each multiple-choice option by combining the spectra for a 1:1 mixture.
