    # --- Physics Derivation ---
    # The survival fraction is N/N0 = exp(-t_lab / t_dilated).
    # With t_lab = R/c and t_dilated = gamma * tau, we get N/N0 = exp(-R / (c * gamma * tau)).
    # Taking the natural log: ln(N/N0) = -R / (c * gamma * tau).
    # This means gamma * ln(N/N0) = -R / (c * tau), which is a constant.
    # Therefore, gamma_1 * ln(survival_fraction_1) = gamma_2 * ln(survival_fraction_2).
    # Solving for gamma_2:
    # gamma_2 = gamma_1 * ln(survival_fraction_1) / ln(survival_fraction_2)
    # gamma_2 = 20 * ln(1/3) / ln(2/3)
    # Using log properties ln(a/b) = ln(a) - ln(b) and ln(1/x) = -ln(x):
    # gamma_2 = 20 * (-ln(3)) / (ln(2) - ln(3))
    # gamma_2 = 20 * ln(3) / (ln(3) - ln(2))
    # gamma_2 = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)
    # This confirms the formula used by the LLM is correct.
