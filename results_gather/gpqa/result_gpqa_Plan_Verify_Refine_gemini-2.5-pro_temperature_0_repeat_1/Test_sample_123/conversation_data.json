    "*   **Plan:**\n    1.  Establish the exponential decay law in the lab frame, relating the fraction of surviving particles to the time of flight and the dilated lifetime.\n    2.  Use the data from the first scenario (γ₁=20, survival=1/3) to set up an equation.\n    3.  Use the data from the second scenario (γ₂=?, survival=2/3) to set up another equation.\n    4.  Solve the system of two equations to find the unknown Lorentz factor, γ₂.\n\n*   **Action:** The fraction of particles `N/N₀` that survive after a time `t` in the lab frame is given by the radioactive decay law: `N/N₀ = exp(-t / t_dilated)`.\n    The time of flight to the detector wall is `t = R/v`. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, `v ≈ c`, so `t ≈ R/c`.\n    The dilated lifetime in the lab frame is `t_dilated = γ * τ`, where `τ` is the proper lifetime.\n    So, the governing equation is `N/N₀ = exp(-R / (c * γ * τ))`.\n\n    Let's set up the equations for the two scenarios:\n    1) `1/3 = exp(-R / (c * 20 * τ))`\n    2) `2/3 = exp(-R / (c * γ₂ * τ))`\n\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides for each equation:\n    1) `ln(1/3) = -R / (c * 20 * τ)`  => `ln(3) = R / (20 * c * τ)`\n    2) `ln(2/3) = -R / (c * γ₂ * τ)`  => `ln(3/2) = R / (γ₂ * c * τ)`\n\n    Now, I can create a ratio of the two equations to eliminate the unknown constant term `R / (c * τ)`:\n    `(ln(3)) / (ln(3/2)) = (R / (20 * c * τ)) / (R / (γ₂ * c * τ))`\n    `ln(3) / ln(3/2) = γ₂ / 20`\n    `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n    I will now calculate this value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ngamma_1 = 20\n# Calculate gamma_2 = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)\ngamma_2 = gamma_1 * math.log(3) / math.log(3/2)\nprint(f\"The required Lorentz factor is: {gamma_2}\")\n```\n\n*   **Result:** The calculation shows that the required Lorentz factor is approximately 54.19. This value is very close to option A.\n\nThe required Lorentz factor is `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2) ≈ 54.19`. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "*   **Plan:**\n    1.  Formulate the relationship between the fraction of surviving particles, the Lorentz factor (γ), the detector radius (R), and the particle's proper lifetime (τ). The governing equation is `N/N₀ = exp(-t / t_dilated)`.\n    2.  Substitute the known quantities: time of flight `t ≈ R/c` and dilated lifetime `t_dilated = γ * τ`.

Solve the system of equations for the unknown Lorentz factor, γ₂.\n\n*   **Action:**\n    Let's write down the equations for the two scenarios. Let `K = R / (c * τ)` be a constant term, since R, c, and the proper lifetime τ are the same in both scenarios.\n\n    Scenario 1: `N/N₀ = 1/3`, `γ₁ = 20`\n    `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n    Taking the natural log of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n    `-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n    `ln(3) = K / 20`  (Equation 1)\n\n    Scenario 2: `N/N₀ = 2/3`, `γ₂ = ?`\n    `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n    Taking the natural log of both sides:\n    `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`\n    `-ln(3/2) = -K / γ₂`\n    `ln(3/2) = K / γ₂` (Equation 2)\n\n    Now we have a system of two equations. We can solve for K in Equation 1: `K = 20 * ln(3)`.\n    Substitute this expression for K into Equation 2:\n    `ln(3/2) = (20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n    Now, solve for γ₂:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n    I will now use Python to calculate the numerical value of γ₂.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate gamma_2 using the derived formula\ngamma_2 = 20 * math.log(3) / math.log(3/2)\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\n\n*   **Result:** The calculated value for the new Lorentz factor is approximately 54.19.

    "The relationship between the fraction of surviving particles (`f`), the Lorentz factor (`γ`), the detector radius (`R`), and the particle's proper lifetime (`τ`) is described by the exponential decay law in the laboratory frame.\n\nThe time it takes for a particle to travel to the detector wall in the lab frame is `t_lab = R/v`. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. So, `t_lab ≈ R/c`.\n\nThe lifetime of the particles in the lab frame is dilated by the Lorentz factor: `t_dilated = γ * τ`.\n\nThe fraction of particles that survive is given by `f = N/N₀ = exp(-t_lab / t_dilated)`.\nSubstituting the expressions for `t_lab` and `t_dilated`, we get:\n`f = exp(- (R/c) / (γ * τ) ) = exp(-R / (c * γ * τ))`\n\nLet's define a constant `K = R / (c * τ)`, which depends on the detector setup and the particle's intrinsic properties, but not on the Lorentz factor. The equation becomes:\n`f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for `K`:\n`ln(f) = -K / γ`\n`K = -γ * ln(f) = γ * ln(1/f)`\n\nSince `K` is the same for both scenarios, we can write:\n`γ₁ * ln(1/f₁) = γ₂ * ln(1/f₂)`\n\nNow, we plug in the values from the problem:\n*   Scenario 1: `γ₁ = 20`, `f₁ = 1/3`\n*   Scenario 2: `γ₂ = ?`, `f₂ = 2/3`\n\n`20 * ln(1 / (1/3)) = γ₂ * ln(1 / (2/3))`\n`20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\nNow, we solve for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))`\n\nUsing the values `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`:\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055) ≈ 20 * 2.709 ≈ 54.18`\n\nThis value is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
