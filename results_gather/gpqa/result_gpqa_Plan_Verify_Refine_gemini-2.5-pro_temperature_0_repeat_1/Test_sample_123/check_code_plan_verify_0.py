    This function verifies the LLM's answer by recalculating the required Lorentz factor.

    The physics behind the calculation is as follows:
    1. The fraction of particles surviving (N/N0) after a time 't' in the lab frame is given by the exponential decay law:
       N/N0 = exp(-t / t_dilated)
    2. The time of flight 't' to the detector wall of radius 'R' is t = R/v. For ultra-relativistic particles, v ≈ c (speed of light), so t ≈ R/c.
    3. The particle's lifetime in the lab frame is dilated by the Lorentz factor 'γ': t_dilated = γ * τ, where 'τ' is the proper lifetime.
    4. Combining these, the survival fraction is: N/N0 = exp(-R / (c * γ * τ)).
    5. Let's define a constant K = R / (c * τ), which depends on the detector radius and the particle's proper lifetime. The equation simplifies to:
       N/N0 = exp(-K / γ)
    6. We can solve for K using the first scenario's data and then use it to find γ for the second scenario. A more direct way is to set up a ratio.
       Taking the natural log: ln(N/N0) = -K / γ  =>  γ * ln(1 / (N/N0)) = K
    7. Since K is constant for both scenarios:
       γ₁ * ln(1 / survival₁) = γ₂ * ln(1 / survival₂)
    8. Solving for γ₂:
       γ₂ = γ₁ * ln(1 / survival₁) / ln(1 / survival₂)
