    Checks the correctness of the LLM's answer for the particle physics problem.

    The core relationship is f = exp(-R / (c * γ * τ)), where f is the survival fraction,
    R is the radius, c is the speed of light, γ is the Lorentz factor, and τ is the proper lifetime.
    From this, we can derive γ * ln(1/f) = R / (c * τ).
    Since R, c, and τ are constant, we have the relation:
    γ₁ * ln(1/f₁) = γ₂ * ln(1/f₂)
