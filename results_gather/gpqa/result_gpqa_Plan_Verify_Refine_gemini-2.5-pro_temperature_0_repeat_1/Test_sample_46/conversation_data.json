    "*   **Plan:**\n    1.  Calculate the degree of unsaturation (DoU) from the molecular formula C9H11NO2.\n    2.  Analyze the IR spectrum to identify key functional groups.\n    3.  Analyze the 1H NMR spectrum to identify structural fragments and their connectivity.\n    4.  Combine the information to deduce the structure and match it with the given options.\n\n*   **Execution (Action 1):**\n    Let's start by calculating the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to get an initial idea of the structure (rings, double/triple bonds). The formula for DoU is:\n    DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\n    where C = number of carbons, H = number of hydrogens, X = number of halogens, N = number of nitrogens.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation for C9H11NO2\nC = 9\nH = 11\nN = 1\nDoU = C + 1 - (H / 2) + (N / 2)\nprint(f\"Degree of Unsaturation (DoU): {DoU}\")\n```\n\n*   **Result:**\n```\nDegree of Unsaturation (DoU): 5.0\n```\n*   **Refined Plan:**\n    1.  A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DoU) and one additional double bond (1 DoU), likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n    2.  Analyze the IR spectrum to confirm the functional groups, specifically the carbonyl and the group indicated by the N-H stretches.\n    3.  Analyze the 1H NMR spectrum to piece together the fragments (ethyl group, benzene ring substitution pattern).\n    4.  Propose a final structure and select the correct option.\n\n*   **Execution (Action 2):**\n    Let's analyze the key features of the IR and 1H NMR spectra based on the provided data.\n\n    **IR Analysis:**\n    *   **3420 cm-1, 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two distinct bands in this region is characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching of a primary amine (-NH2).\n    *   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl region. This frequency is typical for an ester C=O, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring. It is too high for a typical amide.\n\n    **1H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet/quartet pattern is the classic signature of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates the -CH2- group is attached to an electronegative atom, most likely an oxygen, as in an ethyl ester (-O-CH2CH3).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is consistent with the two protons of the primary amine (-NH2) identified in the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2H, are indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The downfield doublet (8.0 ppm) is ortho to a strong electron-withdrawing group (like the ester), and the upfield doublet (7.0 ppm) is ortho to an electron-donating group (the amine).\n\n    **Conclusion from Spectra:**\n    The data points to a structure containing a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring, with a primary amine (-NH2) group and an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) group as the substituents. This structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n    Let's check this against the options:\n    *   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide.\n    *   B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: Correct. This is a para-substituted ethyl ester with a primary amine. All spectral data match perfectly.\n    *   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide.\n    *   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. This has a propionate group, and the ester linkage is through the phenyl oxygen, which would give a different NMR spectrum.\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly supports ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>",

Analyze the 1H NMR spectrum to identify structural fragments and their connectivity.\n    4.  Combine the information to deduce the structure and match it with the given options.\n\n*   **Execution (Action 1):**\n    First, I will calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to determine the number of rings and/or pi bonds in the molecule. The formula is DoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation for C9H11NO2\nC = 9\nH = 11\nN = 1\nDoU = C + 1 - (H / 2) + (N / 2)\nprint(f\"Degree of Unsaturation (DoU): {DoU}\")\n```\n\n*   **Result:**\n```\nDegree of Unsaturation (DoU): 5.0\n```\n*   **Refined Plan:**\n    1.  The DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional pi bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n    2.  Next, I will analyze the IR and 1H NMR data to confirm the functional groups and determine the overall structure.\n    3.  I will synthesize the findings from the DoU, IR, and NMR to propose a final structure and select the correct option.\n\n*   **Execution (Action 2):**\n    I will now interpret the spectral data in a single step, as all the information is available.\n\n    *   **IR Analysis:**\n        *   **3420 cm⁻¹ & 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct bands in this region is the classic signature of a primary amine (-NH₂), corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches.\n        *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) region. This frequency is characteristic of an ester, particularly one conjugated with an aromatic ring. It is too high for a typical amide C=O.\n\n    *   **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n        *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) & 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pattern with a 3H:2H integration ratio is the unmistakable signature of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The significant downfield shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates the -CH₂- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, which is consistent with the oxygen of an ethyl ester (-O-CH₂CH₃).\n        *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the two protons of the primary amine (-NH₂) group identified from the IR spectrum. The broadness is due to chemical exchange and quadrupolar effects.\n        *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) & 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2H, indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The upfield doublet (~7.0 ppm) is adjacent to the electron-donating amine group, while the downfield doublet (~8.0 ppm) is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing ester group.\n\n    *   **Conclusion:**\n        The combined data points to a molecule with a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring. The substituents are a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃). This structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n    *   **Matching with Options:**\n        *   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide.\n        *   B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: Correct. This structure perfectly matches all spectral data: a primary amine, an ethyl ester, and a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n        *   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H stretch.\n        *   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. The ester linkage is different (phenyl ester), and the alkyl group is a propionate, which would give a different NMR signal for the alkyl protons.\n\nThe evidence conclusively identifies the compound as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>",

    "The previous step correctly calculated the Degree of Unsaturation as 5.0. The checker feedback indicated a formula mismatch between the proposed answer (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, C9H11N1O2) and the given formula (C9H11NO2). This feedback is incorrect, as these two formulas are identical. My analysis shows that ethyl 4-aminobenzoate is the only structure that fits all the spectral data. I will now provide the complete analysis to justify the final answer.\n\n*   **Plan:**\n    1.  Synthesize the information from the molecular formula (DoU=5), IR spectrum, and 1H NMR spectrum.\n    2.  Systematically evaluate each of the given options against the combined spectral evidence.\n    3.  Conclude with the only structure that is fully consistent with all data.\n\n*   **Execution (Action 2):**\n    I will now perform a comprehensive analysis of all the data to identify the correct compound.\n\n    1.  **Molecular Formula & DoU:** C9H11NO2. The Degree of Unsaturation is 5. This strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (4 degrees) and one additional pi bond (1 degree), likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n    2.  **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   The two bands at **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹** are characteristic of the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. This immediately rules out option **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**, which is a secondary amide and would only show one N-H band.\n        *   The strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹** is in the carbonyl region. This frequency is typical for a conjugated **ester**. It is generally too high for a conjugated amide (like in option A) and a bit low for a phenyl ester (like in option D), making a conjugated ethyl ester the best fit.\n\n    3.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   The signals at **1.20 ppm (triplet, 3H)** and **4.5 ppm (quartet, 2H)** are the definitive signature of an **ethyl group attached to an oxygen (-O-CH₂CH₃)**. The very downfield shift of the quartet to 4.5 ppm is characteristic of an ethyl ester. This piece of evidence rules out:\n            *   **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide**: This has an ethoxy group, but the -OCH₂- quartet would be around 4.0-4.1 ppm.\n            *   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate**: This has a propionyl group (-CO-CH₂CH₃). The quartet for the -CH₂- group adjacent to a carbonyl would appear around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n        *   The signal at **4.0 ppm (broad singlet, 2H)** confirms the presence of the **primary amine (-NH₂)** group.\n        *   The signals at **7.0 ppm (doublet, 2H)** and **8.0 ppm (doublet, 2H)** indicate a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. This rules out option **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide**, which is meta-substituted.\n\n    **Conclusion:**\n    Every piece of spectral data points unequivocally to **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n    *   It has a primary amine (-NH₂).\n    *   It has an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n    *   It has a 1,4-disubstituted (para) ring.\n    *   Its molecular formula is C9H11NO2.\n\n    Therefore, option B is the only correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
