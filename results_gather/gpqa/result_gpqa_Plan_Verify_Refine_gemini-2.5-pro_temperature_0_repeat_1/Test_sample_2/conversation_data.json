    "*   **Plan:**\n    1.  Represent the quantum state `|ψ⟩`, the Pauli matrices `σ_x` and `σ_z`, and the operator `O = 10σ_z + 5σ_x` using numerical libraries.\n    2.  Calculate the expectation value `⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩` using matrix multiplication.\n    3.  Round the result to one decimal place and compare it with the given options.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the spin-up and spin-down basis vectors\nspin_up = np.array([1, 0])\nspin_down = np.array([0, 1])\n\n# Define the state |ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2|↓⟩\npsi = 0.5 * spin_up + (np.sqrt(3)/2) * spin_down\n\n# Define the Pauli matrices\nsigma_x = np.array([[0, 1], [1, 0]])\nsigma_z = np.array([[1, 0], [0, -1]])\n\n# Define the operator O = 10σ_z + 5σ_x\noperator_O = 10 * sigma_z + 5 * sigma_x\n\n# Calculate the expectation value ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩\n# In numpy, this is psi_dagger @ operator_O @ psi\n# where psi_dagger is the conjugate transpose of psi.\n# Since psi is real, the conjugate transpose is just the transpose.\npsi_dagger = psi.conj().T\nexpectation_value = psi_dagger @ operator_O @ psi\n\nprint(f\"The state |ψ⟩ is: {psi}\")\nprint(f\"The operator O is:\\n{operator_O}\")\nprint(f\"The expectation value ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩ is: {expectation_value}\")\nprint(f\"The expectation value rounded to one decimal place is: {expectation_value:.1f}\")\n```\nThe calculated expectation value is approximately -0.67. Rounding this to one decimal place gives -0.7. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "An alternative way to calculate this is to find the expectation values of `σ_z` and `σ_x` separately.\n\nThe state is `|ψ⟩ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩`, where `a = 0.5` and `b = sqrt(3)/2`.\nThe expectation value of an operator `O` is `⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩`.\n\n1.  **Expectation value of `σ_z`:**\n    `⟨σ_z⟩ = ⟨ψ|σ_z|ψ⟩`\n    Since `|↑⟩` and `|↓⟩` are eigenstates of `σ_z` with eigenvalues +1 and -1 respectively:\n    `σ_z|ψ⟩ = σ_z(a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩) = a(+1)|↑⟩ + b(-1)|↓⟩ = a|↑⟩ - b|↓⟩`\n    `⟨σ_z⟩ = (a*⟨↑| + b*⟨↓|)(a|↑⟩ - b|↓⟩) = a² - b²`\n    `a² = (0.5)² = 0.25`\n    `b² = (sqrt(3)/2)² = 3/4 = 0.75`\n    `⟨σ_z⟩ = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5`\n\n2.  **Expectation value of `σ_x`:**\n    `⟨σ_x⟩ = ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩`\n    We know `σ_x|↑⟩ = |↓⟩` and `σ_x|↓⟩ = |↑⟩`.\n    `σ_x|ψ⟩ = σ_x(a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩) = a|↓⟩ + b|↑⟩`\n    `⟨σ_x⟩ = (a*⟨↑| + b*⟨↓|)(b|↑⟩ + a|↓⟩) = a*b + b*a = 2ab`\n    `2ab = 2 * (0.5) * (sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866`\n\n3.  **Expectation value of the full operator `10σ_z + 5σ_x`:**\n    By linearity of expectation values:\n    `⟨10σ_z + 5σ_x⟩ = 10⟨σ_z⟩ + 5⟨σ_x⟩`\n    `= 10 * (-0.5) + 5 * (sqrt(3)/2)`\n    `= -5 + 2.5 * sqrt(3)`\n    `≈ -5 + 2.5 * 1.732`\n    `≈ -5 + 4.33`\n    `≈ -0.67`\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the value is -0.7. This matches the result from the Python script.\n\nThe final answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
