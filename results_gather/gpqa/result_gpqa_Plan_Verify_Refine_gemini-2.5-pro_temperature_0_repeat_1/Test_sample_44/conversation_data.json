    "*   **Plan:**\n    1.  Determine the single-particle energy levels for a 1D infinite potential well.\n    2.  Calculate the ground state energy by filling these levels with four spin-1/2 particles, respecting the Pauli exclusion principle.\n    3.  Determine the configurations for the first and second excited states by promoting particles to higher energy levels and calculate their total energies.\n    4.  Compare the calculated energies with the given options.\n\n*   **Action:**\n    I will execute the first step of the plan. The energy levels for a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L are given by the formula `E_n = n^2 * (pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2 * m * L^2)`. The problem defines `E = (pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2 * m * L^2)`. Therefore, the single-particle energy levels are `E_n = n^2 * E`. I will now calculate the energies for the first few levels.\n\n```python\n# Define the base energy unit E as 1 for calculation purposes.\nE = 1\n\n# Calculate the energy for the first few quantum levels (n=1, 2, 3, 4)\nE1 = 1**2 * E\nE2 = 2**2 * E\nE3 = 3**2 * E\nE4 = 4**2 * E\n\nprint(f\"E_1 = {E1}E\")\nprint(f\"E_2 = {E2}E\")\nprint(f\"E_3 = {E3}E\")\nprint(f\"E_4 = {E4}E\")\n```\n\n*   **Result:**\n```text\nE_1 = 1E\nE_2 = 4E\nE_3 = 9E\nE_4 = 16E\n```\n\n*   **Plan:**\n    1.  ~~Determine the single-particle energy levels for a 1D infinite potential well.~~\n    2.  Calculate the ground state energy by filling the calculated energy levels (`E_1=E`, `E_2=4E`, etc.) with four spin-1/2 particles, respecting the Pauli exclusion principle.\n    3.  Determine the configurations for the first and second excited states and calculate their energies.\n    4.  Compare the calculated energies with the given options.\n\n*   **Action:**\n    Now I will calculate the ground state energy. Since the particles are spin-1/2 fermions, each energy level `E_n` can hold a maximum of two particles (one spin-up, one spin-down). To find the ground state, I will fill the lowest available energy levels.\n    -   The lowest level `E_1` will hold two particles.\n    -   The next level `E_2` will hold the remaining two particles.\n    I will calculate the total energy for this configuration.\n\n```python\n# Single particle energies\nE1 = 1\nE2 = 4\n\n# Ground state configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=2\nE_ground = (2 * E1) + (2 * E2)\n\nprint(f\"Ground State Energy = {E_ground}E\")\n```\n\n*   **Result:**\n```text\nGround State Energy = 10E\n```\n\n*   **Plan:**\n    1.  ~~Determine the single-particle energy levels for a 1D infinite potential well.~~\n    2.  ~~Calculate the ground state energy (10E).~~\n    3.  Determine the configurations for the first and second excited states and calculate their energies.\n    4.  Compare the calculated energies with the given options.\n\n*   **Action:**\n    Next, I will calculate the energy of the first excited state. This is achieved by taking the ground state configuration and promoting one particle to the next available energy level with the smallest possible energy increase. The ground state has levels `n=1` and `n=2` filled. The lowest energy excitation is to move one particle from `n=2` to `n=3`.\n    -   Configuration: Two particles in `n=1`, one particle in `n=2`, one particle in `n=3`.\n    I will calculate the total energy for this configuration.\n\n```python\n# Single particle energies\nE1 = 1\nE2 = 4\nE3 = 9\n\n# First excited state configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3\nE_first_excited = (2 * E1) + (1 * E2) + (1 * E3)\n\nprint(f\"First Excited State Energy = {E_first_excited}E\")\n```\n\n*   **Result:**\n```text\nFirst Excited State Energy = 15E\n```\n\n*   **Plan:**\n    1.  ~~Determine the single-particle energy levels for a 1D infinite potential well.~~\n    2.  ~~Calculate the ground state energy (10E).~~\n    3.  ~~Calculate the first excited state energy (15E).~~\n    4.  Determine the configuration for the second excited state by finding the next lowest energy excitation and calculate its energy.\n    5.  Compare the final set of energies (Ground, 1st, 2nd) with the given options.\n\n*   **Action:**\n    Finally, I will calculate the energy of the second excited state. There are two possibilities for the next lowest excitation from the ground state:\n    1.  Promote one particle from `n=2` to `n=4`.\n    2.  Promote one particle from `n=1` to `n=3`.\n    I will calculate the energy for both configurations and the lower one will be the second excited state.\n\n```python\n# Single particle energies\nE1 = 1\nE2 = 4\nE3 = 9\nE4 = 16\n\n# Possibility 1: Promote n=2 -> n=4. Config: 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4\nE_config1 = (2 * E1) + (1 * E2) + (1 * E4)\n\n# Possibility 2: Promote n=1 -> n=3. Config: 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3\nE_config2 = (1 * E1) + (2 * E2) + (1 * E3)\n\nprint(f\"Energy of configuration 1 (2->4 promotion) = {E_config1}E\")\nprint(f\"Energy of configuration 2 (1->3 promotion) = {E_config2}E\")\n\n# The second excited state is the one with the lower energy\nE_second_excited = min(E_config1, E_config2)\nprint(f\"Second Excited State Energy = {E_second_excited}E\")\n```\n\n*   **Result:**\n```text\nEnergy of configuration 1 (2->4 promotion) = 22E\nEnergy of configuration 2 (1->3 promotion) = 18E\nSecond Excited State Energy = 18E\n```\nThe calculated energies are:\n- Ground State: 10E\n- First Excited State: 15E\n- Second Excited State: 18E\n\nThis corresponds to the sequence 10E, 15E, 18E.

The particles are spin-1/2 fermions, so a maximum of two particles can occupy each energy level (Pauli exclusion principle).

The second excited state is the configuration with the third-lowest total energy. I need to find the next possible excitation from the ground state (`2@n=1, 2@n=2`) that has the lowest energy increase after the first excited state.\n    -   First excited state (`E=15E`): Promote one particle `n=2 -> n=3`. Energy increase: `E_3 - E_2 = 9E - 4E = 5E`.\n    -   Next possibility: Promote one particle `n=1 -> n=3`. Energy increase: `E_3 - E_1 = 9E - 1E = 8E`. Total energy: `10E + 8E = 18E`.\n    -   Another possibility: Promote two particles `n=2 -> n=3`. Energy increase: `2*(E_3 - E_2) = 2*5E = 10E`. Total energy: `10E + 10E = 20E`.\n    The lowest energy increase after the first excited state is 8E, leading to a total energy of 18E. This will be the second excited state.
