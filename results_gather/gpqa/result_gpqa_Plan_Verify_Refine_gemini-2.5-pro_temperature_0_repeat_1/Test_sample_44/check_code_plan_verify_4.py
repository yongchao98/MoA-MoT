    This function verifies the energies of the ground state, first excited state,
    and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a
    one-dimensional infinite potential well.

    The energy unit is E = (pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2 * m * L^2).
    The single-particle energy levels are E_n = n^2 * E for n = 1, 2, 3, ...

    Particles are spin-1/2, so they are fermions and obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle.
    This means each energy level 'n' can hold at most two particles (one spin-up, one spin-down).
