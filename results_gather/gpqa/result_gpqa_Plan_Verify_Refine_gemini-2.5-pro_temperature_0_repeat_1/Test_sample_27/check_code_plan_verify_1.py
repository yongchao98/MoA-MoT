    # Step 2: Gilman addition and Benzylation
    # Principle 2a: Gilman reagent (Ph2CuLi) performs a 1,4-conjugate addition.
    # Principle 2b: The nucleophile (Phenyl) adds 'anti' to the bulky substituent at the existing stereocenter (C4-OTBS).
    # Given C4 is (S), this trans addition results in a (3R) configuration.
    expected_step2_phenyl_stereo = "3R"
    # Principle 2c: The resulting enolate is trapped by benzyl bromide. The provided answer argues for chelation control,
    # forcing the benzyl group to add 'syn' to the phenyl group. This is a plausible argument for this system and
    # results in a (2S) configuration.
    expected_step2_benzyl_stereo = "2S"

    # Step 3: LDA methylation
    # Principle 3a: LDA at low temperature is a bulky, non-nucleophilic base that forms the KINETIC enolate.
    # Principle 3b: The kinetic enolate is formed by deprotonating the LEAST sterically hindered alpha-proton.
    # The alpha-protons are at C2 (tertiary, substituted) and C6 (secondary, less substituted).
    # Therefore, deprotonation and subsequent methylation must occur at C6.
