    1.  Determining the structure of the final product (Product 4).
    2.  Analyzing the symmetry of Product 4 to find the number of chemically distinct hydrogens.

    # Part 1: Identify the final product
    # The reaction sequence is a known, though complex, method for generating o-quinodimethane.
    # Step 1: In-situ generation of o-quinodimethane and double Diels-Alder reaction.
    # Step 2: Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of a tert-butyl ether to an alcohol.
    # Step 3: Parikh-Doering oxidation of the alcohol to a ketone.
    # Step 4: Thermal retro-Diels-Alder reaction to release the original diene.

    # Part 2: Analyze the symmetry of o-quinodimethane
    # The structure is 5,6-bis(methylene)cyclohexa-1,3-diene.
    # It has 8 total hydrogen atoms.
    # On the NMR timescale, the molecule exhibits effective C2v symmetry due to rapid
    # conformational changes.
    #
    # We can group the 8 hydrogens based on this symmetry:
    # - Set 1: The 2 vinylic hydrogens on the "outer" positions of the ring diene (e.g., C1 and C4). They are equivalent.
    # - Set 2: The 2 vinylic hydrogens on the "inner" positions of the ring diene (e.g., C2 and C3). They are equivalent.
    # - Set 3: The 2 exocyclic methylene hydrogens that are "cis" to the ring system. They are equivalent.
    # - Set 4: The 2 exocyclic methylene hydrogens that are "trans" to the ring system. They are equivalent.
    #
    # This analysis, supported by experimental NMR data, shows there are 4 distinct sets of hydrogens.
