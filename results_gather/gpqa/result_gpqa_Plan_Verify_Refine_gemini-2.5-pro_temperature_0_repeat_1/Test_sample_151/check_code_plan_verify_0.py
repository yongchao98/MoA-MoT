    Checks the correctness of the answer based on the biological context of yeast shmoo formation.

    The logic is as follows:
    1. Define the cellular state: Yeast shmoo formation implies G1 cell cycle arrest,
       high transcriptional activity (mating response), and inhibited DNA replication.
    2. Define the experiment: ChIP-MS for "active chromatin", which enriches for proteins
       bound to transcriptionally active regions.
    3. Evaluate the abundance of each complex in this specific context.
       - Complexes directly involved in the high transcriptional activity will be abundant.
       - Complexes whose function is inhibited or are not related to the primary activity
         (transcription) will be less abundant.
