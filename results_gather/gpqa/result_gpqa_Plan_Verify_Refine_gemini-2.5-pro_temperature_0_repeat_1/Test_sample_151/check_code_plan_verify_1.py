    # --- Biological Context & Assumptions ---
    # 1. Cell State: Yeast in G1 arrest (shmoo formation).
    # 2. Primary Activity: High levels of transcription for mating response.
    # 3. Inhibited Activity: Progression into S-phase (DNA replication) is blocked.
    # 4. Experiment: ChIP-MS for proteins on "active chromatin".
    # 5. "Active Chromatin" is defined here by high transcriptional activity.
    # 6. The question asks for the LEAST observed complex.

    # --- Model of Protein Complexes ---
    # We assign a conceptual "abundance score" based on the expected recovery
    # in this specific experiment. Higher score = more abundant.
