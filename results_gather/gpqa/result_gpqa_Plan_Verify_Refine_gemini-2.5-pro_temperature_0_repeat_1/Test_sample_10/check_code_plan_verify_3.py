It occurs at the junction of ORF1a and ORF1b, involves a -1 shift guided by a slippery sequence and a downstream RNA pseudoknot, and produces the pp1a and pp1ab polyproteins.

Its function is to *remove* mismatched nucleotides by *degrading* or *cleaving* the newly synthesized RNA strand. Therefore, it actively *causes* RNA breakdown for error correction, it does not *prevent* it. The claim is the opposite of the complex's known function."
