    "<information>### Unveiling the Potential Energy of a Point Charge Near a Grounded Conducting Sphere\n\nWhen a point charge is brought near a grounded conducting sphere, an electrostatic interaction occurs, resulting in a potential energy that can be determined using a powerful technique in electrostatics known as the method of images. This method simplifies the problem by replacing the complex charge distribution on the sphere with a single, imaginary \"image charge\" inside the sphere.\n\nThe key to this method is that the electric potential on the surface of the grounded conducting sphere is zero. By strategically placing an image charge, the potential created by the original point charge and the image charge on the spherical surface sums to zero, satisfying the boundary condition.\n\n#### The Image Charge and its Properties\n\nConsider a point charge `q` located at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R` (where `d > R`). The problem can be solved by introducing an image charge, `q'`, with the following characteristics:\n\n*   **Magnitude:** The magnitude of the image charge is `q' = - (R/d) * q`. The negative sign indicates that the image charge has the opposite polarity to the real charge, leading to an attractive force.\n*   **Location:** The image charge is located inside the sphere at a distance `b = R^2 / d` from the center, along the line connecting the center and the point charge `q`.\n\nAs the real charge `q` moves closer to the sphere, the image charge `q'` increases in magnitude and moves closer to the surface from within.\n\n#### Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe potential energy of the system is equivalent to the work done to bring the point charge `q` from an infinite distance to its position `d` from the center of the sphere. This can be calculated by integrating the force between the real charge and the image charge from infinity to `d`.\n\nThe force `F` between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'` is given by Coulomb's law:\n\n`F = (1 / 4πε₀) * (q * q') / (d - b)²`\n\nSubstituting the expressions for `q'` and `b`, the force as a function of distance `x` from the center is:\n\n`F(x) = - (1 / 4πε₀) * (q² * R * x) / (x² - R²)²`\n\nThe potential energy `U` is the work done against this attractive force to bring the charge from infinity to the distance `d`. Therefore, it is the negative integral of the force from infinity to `d`:\n\n`U(d) = - ∫[∞ to d] F(x) dx`\n\nUpon performing this integration, the potential energy of the point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of the grounded conducting sphere is found to be:\n\n**`U(d) = - (1 / 4πε₀) * (q² * R) / (2 * (d² - R²))`**\n\nThis formula can also be expressed as half the potential energy of the interaction between the real charge and the image charge. It's important to note that the self-energy of the induced charge distribution on the sphere is a crucial component of the total energy of the system.\n\nIn essence, the presence of the grounded conducting sphere lowers the potential energy of the point charge, indicating an attractive interaction. This principle is fundamental to understanding various physical phenomena, from the behavior of electrons near metal surfaces to the design of electrostatic devices.</information>\nChecker feedback:\noutput: Correct"
