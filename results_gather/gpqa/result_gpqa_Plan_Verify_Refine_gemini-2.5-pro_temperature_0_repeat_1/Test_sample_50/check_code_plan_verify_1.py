    q_prime = -q * R / d
    b = R**2 / d

    # The distance between the real charge 'q' and the image charge 'q_prime' is (d - b).
    V_image = k * q_prime / (d - b)
    
    # 3. The potential energy of the system is half the product of the real charge
    #    and the potential created by the induced (image) charge. The factor of 1/2
    #    is because the induced charge is not fixed but builds up as 'q' is brought in.
