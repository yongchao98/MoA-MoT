    "<information>### Unveiling the Geometry of Crystals: The Interplanar Distance Formula for a Rhombohedral System\n\nFor a rhombohedral crystal system, the interplanar distance (d), which is the perpendicular distance between adjacent parallel planes of atoms, is determined by a specific formula that accounts for its unique geometry. This formula relates the Miller indices (h, k, l) of the planes, the lattice constant 'a', and the inter-axial angle 'α'.\n\nThe formula for the interplanar spacing (d) in a rhombohedral crystal is:\n\n**d = a * sqrt((1 - 3*cos²(α) + 2*cos³(α)) / ((h² + k² + l²)sin²(α) + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cos²(α) - cos(α))))**\n\nIn this equation:\n\n*   **d** represents the interplanar spacing.\n*   **a** is the lattice constant, which is the length of the side of the unit cell.\n*   **(h, k, l)** are the Miller indices, which define a specific set of parallel planes in the crystal.\n*   **α** is the angle between the crystallographic axes.\n\nThis formula is essential in fields such as X-ray crystallography and materials science for identifying and characterizing crystalline materials. By measuring the diffraction angles of X-rays from a crystal, scientists can calculate the interplanar spacing and, using this formula, determine the lattice parameters of the rhombohedral unit cell.</information>\nChecker feedback:\noutput:",
