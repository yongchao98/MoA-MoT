    # i) HNO3/H2SO4 -> Nitrobenzene
    # ii) Fe/HCl -> Aniline
    # iii) NaNO2/HCl -> Diazonium salt

    # i) HNO3/H2SO4 -> Nitrobenzene
    # ii) Fe/HCl -> Aniline
    # iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 -> Friedel-Crafts Acylation

    # Here is the critical flaw. The ring has two deactivating groups:
    # - Acetyl (-COCH3) at C1: meta-director (directs to C5). Strong deactivator.
    # - Bromo (-Br) at C3: ortho,para-director (directs to C2, C4, C6). Weak deactivator.
    # In electrophilic substitution, the directing effect of the least deactivating group (or strongest activating group) prevails.
    # The bromo group's o,p-directing effect will control the substitution.
    # Therefore, the incoming nitro group will add primarily to positions C4 and C6, not C5.
