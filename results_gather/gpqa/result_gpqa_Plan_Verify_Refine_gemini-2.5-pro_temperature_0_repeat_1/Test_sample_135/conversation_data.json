    "This problem asks for the volume integral of the divergence of a radial vector field. The most direct way to solve this is by using the Divergence Theorem, which relates a volume integral of a divergence to a surface integral of the field over the boundary of the volume.\n\n*   **Plan:**\n    1.  State the Divergence Theorem: `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`.\n    2.  Identify the vector field `f` and the surface element `dS` on the surface of the sphere of radius R.\n    3.  Calculate the surface integral (flux) `∮_S (f ⋅ dS)` over the sphere. The result of this surface integral will be the answer to the original volume integral.\n\n*   **Execution:**\n    1.  **The Divergence Theorem:** The theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field `f` over a volume `V` is equal to the flux of the field through the closed surface `S` that bounds the volume.\n        `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\n    2.  **Identify `f` and `dS`:**\n        *   The vector field is given by `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`, where `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n        *   The surface `S` is a sphere of radius `R`. On this surface, `r = R`, so the field is `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`.\n        *   The differential surface area element `dS` for a sphere in spherical coordinates points radially outward, so `dS = r_hat * R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ`.\n\n    3.  **Calculate the Surface Integral:**\n        We need to compute the dot product `f ⋅ dS` and integrate it over the surface of the sphere.\n        `f ⋅ dS = ((1/R^2) * r_hat) ⋅ (r_hat * R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ)`\n        Since `r_hat ⋅ r_hat = 1`, the dot product simplifies:\n        `f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n        Now, we integrate this over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for the polar angle `θ` are from 0 to `π`, and for the azimuthal angle `φ` are from 0 to `2π`.\n        `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_0^(2π) ∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n        We can separate the integrals:\n        `= (∫_0^(2π) dφ) * (∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ)`\n        `= ([φ]_0^(2π)) * ([-cos(θ)]_0^π)`\n        `= (2π - 0) * (-cos(π) - (-cos(0)))`\n        `= (2π) * (-(-1) - (-1))`\n        `= (2π) * (1 + 1)`\n        `= (2π) * 2 = 4π`\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    According to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence of the field is equal to the flux we just calculated.\n    `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`\n\nNote: The field `f` has a singularity at the origin (`r=0`), where the Divergence Theorem is not strictly applicable. However, the theorem gives the correct result, which can be rigorously confirmed by either excluding an infinitesimal sphere around the origin or by recognizing that the divergence of this field is `4π` times the Dirac delta function, `∇ ⋅ f = 4πδ³(r)`, whose integral over any volume containing the origin is `4π`.\n\nThe calculated value is `4π`. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 0\nB) 4/3 π R\nC) 1\nD) 4 π\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
