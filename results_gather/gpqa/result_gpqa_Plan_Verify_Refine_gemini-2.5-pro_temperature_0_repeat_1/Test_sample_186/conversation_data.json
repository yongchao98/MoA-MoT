    "<information>The apparent magnitude of Canopus is approximately -0.74. This makes it the second-brightest star in the night sky, surpassed only by Sirius.\n\nCanopus, also known as Alpha Carinae, is the brightest star in the southern constellation of Carina. While it is incredibly luminous, its brightness in our sky is due to its distance of about 310 light-years from Earth. For comparison, Sirius appears brighter because it is much closer, at a distance of only 8.6 light-years.\n\nDifferent sources provide slightly varied apparent magnitudes, with some listing it as -0.72 or -0.62. Despite these minor differences, Canopus is consistently recognized as one of the most brilliant stars visible from Earth.</information>\nChecker feedback:\noutput: Incorrect. The provided answer states 4 stars are detectable, but the correct count is 3.\n\nThe error stems from failing to check if all stars are observable from the Paranal Observatory's location in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nA star is only detectable if it is both bright enough AND visible in the sky from the telescope's location.\n\nHere is the detailed analysis:\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\na) Canopus       | V Mag: -0.74 | Bright Enough? 1     | Observable from Paranal? 1     | Status: Detectable\nb) Polaris       | V Mag:  1.98 | Bright Enough? 1     | Observable from Paranal? 0     | Status: Not Detectable\nc) Star (10 pc)  | V Mag: 15.00 | Bright Enough? 1     | Observable from Paranal? 1     | Status: Detectable\nd) Star (200 pc) | V Mag: 21.51 | Bright Enough? 0     | Observable from Paranal? 1     | Status: Not Detectable\ne) Star (5 pc)   | V Mag: 13.49 | Bright Enough? 1     | Observable from Paranal? 1     | Status: Detectable\nf) Star (50 pc)  | V Mag: 18.49 | Bright Enough? 0     | Observable from Paranal? 1     | Status: Not Detectable\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe key mistake was including Polaris.
