Here is my plan to solve the problem:
1.  Determine the structure of compound A from the provided ¹H NMR data.
2.  Deduce the structures of compounds B and C by following the reaction sequence: monobromination followed by elimination with alcoholic KOH.
3.  Identify the reaction between the cis-isomer of C and (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol as a Diels-Alder reaction.
4.  Predict the structure and, crucially, the stereochemistry of the product, compound D, assuming the standard rules for such reactions.
5.  Assign the R/S configuration to the stereocenters of the predicted product D and match it with the given options.

I will now execute the plan. Since this is a chemical reasoning problem, no external tools are needed.

**Step 1: Identify Compound A**
*   The ¹H NMR spectrum shows a triplet for 6H and a quartet for 4H.
*   A 6H triplet suggests two equivalent methyl groups (2 x -CH₃), each adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).
*   A 4H quartet suggests two equivalent methylene groups (2 x -CH₂-), each adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃).
*   This pattern (6H triplet, 4H quartet) is characteristic of two equivalent ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃). The only simple alkane that fits this description is n-butane (CH₃CH₂CH₂CH₃).
*   **Compound A is n-butane.**

**Step 2: Identify Compound B**
*   Compound A (n-butane) undergoes monobromination. This can produce 1-bromobutane or 2-bromobutane.
*   The subsequent reaction will clarify which isomer is formed.

**Step 3: Identify Compound C**
*   Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH, which causes an E2 elimination reaction to form an alkene.
*   If B were 1-bromobutane, elimination would yield only but-1-ene, which does not have geometrical isomers.
*   The problem states that C has two geometrical isomers. This means B must be **2-bromobutane**.
*   Elimination of HBr from 2-bromobutane yields but-2-ene (CH₃-CH=CH-CH₃), which exists as *cis* and *trans* isomers.
*   **Compound C is but-2-ene.** The problem specifies that the **cis-isomer of C** is used in the next step.

**Step 4: Identify the Reaction and Predict Compound D**
*   The reaction is between **cis-but-2-ene** (the dienophile) and **(1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol** (the diene). This is a [4+2] Diels-Alder cycloaddition.
*   The reaction forms a six-membered ring. Let's determine the connectivity and stereochemistry.
    *   **Diene:** (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol. In the required s-cis conformation, the -OH group (at C1) and the -CH₃ group (at C4 of the diene system) are both "outside" substituents.
    *   **Dienophile:** cis-but-2-ene. The two methyl groups are *cis*.
*   **Product Skeleton:** The product is a cyclohexene ring with an -OH group, and three -CH₃ groups. IUPAC numbering gives the -OH group position 1 and the double bond position 2, resulting in a **4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol** skeleton. This eliminates options A and C.
*   **Stereochemistry:** The Diels-Alder reaction is stereospecific.
    1.  The *cis* relationship of the methyl groups in the dienophile is retained. In the product, the methyl groups at C5 and C6 will be *cis* to each other.
    2.  The relative orientation of the diene and dienophile substituents is determined by the transition state (endo or exo).
        *   **Endo approach** (kinetically favored): The "outside" groups of the diene (-OH and -CH₃) end up *trans* to the dienophile's methyl groups.
        *   **Exo approach** (thermodynamically favored): The "outside" groups of the diene (-OH and -CH₃) end up *cis* to the dienophile's methyl groups.
*   Let's analyze the stereochemistry of the **exo product**, where all four key substituents (-OH at C1, -CH₃ at C4, -CH₃ at C5, and -CH₃ at C6) are *cis* to each other.
    *   Let's draw the enantiomer where all four of these groups are pointing "up" (wedge).
*   **Assigning R/S Configuration to the Exo Product:**
    *   **C1:** Priorities are O > C2 > C6 > H. The H is "down" (dash). The path O → C2 → C6 is counter-clockwise. Thus, C1 is **(S)**.
    *   **C4:** Priorities are C3 > C5 > CH₃ > H. The H is "down" (dash). The path C3 → C5 → CH₃ is clockwise. Thus, C4 is **(R)**.
    *   **C5:** Priorities are C4 > C6 > CH₃ > H. The H is "down" (dash). The path C4 → C6 → CH₃ is counter-clockwise. Thus, C5 is **(S)**.
    *   **C6:** Priorities are C1 > C5 > CH₃ > H. The H is "down" (dash). The path C1 → C5 → CH₃ is clockwise. Thus, C6 is **(R)**.
*   The resulting enantiomer is **(1S,4R,5S,6R)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol**.

**Step 5: Match with Options**
*   The calculated structure and stereochemistry, (1S,4R,5S,6R)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol, perfectly matches option D. The reaction must proceed through the exo transition state to yield the product described in the options.
