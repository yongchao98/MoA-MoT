    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n1.  Determine the structure of compound A from the provided ¹H NMR data.\n2.  Deduce the structures of compounds B and C by following the reaction sequence: monobromination followed by elimination with alcoholic KOH.\n3.  Identify the reaction between the cis-isomer of C and (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol as a Diels-Alder reaction.\n4.  Predict the structure and, crucially, the stereochemistry of the product, compound D, assuming the standard rules for such reactions.\n5.  Assign the R/S configuration to the stereocenters of the predicted product D and match it with the given options.\n\nI will now execute the plan. Since this is a chemical reasoning problem, no external tools are needed.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Compound A**\n*   The ¹H NMR spectrum shows a triplet for 6H and a quartet for 4H.\n*   A 6H triplet suggests two equivalent methyl groups (2 x -CH₃), each adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n*   A 4H quartet suggests two equivalent methylene groups (2 x -CH₂-), each adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   This pattern (6H triplet, 4H quartet) is characteristic of two equivalent ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃). The only simple alkane that fits this description is n-butane (CH₃CH₂CH₂CH₃).\n*   **Compound A is n-butane.**\n\n**Step 2: Identify Compound B**\n*   Compound A (n-butane) undergoes monobromination. This can produce 1-bromobutane or 2-bromobutane.\n*   The subsequent reaction will clarify which isomer is formed.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Compound C**\n*   Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH, which causes an E2 elimination reaction to form an alkene.\n*   If B were 1-bromobutane, elimination would yield only but-1-ene, which does not have geometrical isomers.\n*   The problem states that C has two geometrical isomers. This means B must be **2-bromobutane**.\n*   Elimination of HBr from 2-bromobutane yields but-2-ene (CH₃-CH=CH-CH₃), which exists as *cis* and *trans* isomers.\n*   **Compound C is but-2-ene.** The problem specifies that the **cis-isomer of C** is used in the next step.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Reaction and Predict Compound D**\n*   The reaction is between **cis-but-2-ene** (the dienophile) and **(1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol** (the diene). This is a [4+2] Diels-Alder cycloaddition.\n*   The reaction forms a six-membered ring. Let's determine the connectivity and stereochemistry.\n    *   **Diene:** (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol. In the required s-cis conformation, the -OH group (at C1) and the -CH₃ group (at C4 of the diene system) are both \"outside\" substituents.\n    *   **Dienophile:** cis-but-2-ene. The two methyl groups are *cis*.\n*   **Product Skeleton:** The product is a cyclohexene ring with an -OH group, and three -CH₃ groups. IUPAC numbering gives the -OH group position 1 and the double bond position 2, resulting in a **4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol** skeleton. This eliminates options A and C.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The Diels-Alder reaction is stereospecific.\n    1.  The *cis* relationship of the methyl groups in the dienophile is retained. In the product, the methyl groups at C5 and C6 will be *cis* to each other.\n    2.  The relative orientation of the diene and dienophile substituents is determined by the transition state (endo or exo).\n        *   **Endo approach** (kinetically favored): The \"outside\" groups of the diene (-OH and -CH₃) end up *trans* to the dienophile's methyl groups.\n        *   **Exo approach** (thermodynamically favored): The \"outside\" groups of the diene (-OH and -CH₃) end up *cis* to the dienophile's methyl groups.\n*   Let's analyze the stereochemistry of the **exo product**, where all four key substituents (-OH at C1, -CH₃ at C4, -CH₃ at C5, and -CH₃ at C6) are *cis* to each other.\n    *   Let's draw the enantiomer where all four of these groups are pointing \"up\" (wedge).\n*   **Assigning R/S Configuration to the Exo Product:**\n    *   **C1:** Priorities are O > C2 > C6 > H. The H is \"down\" (dash). The path O → C2 → C6 is counter-clockwise. Thus, C1 is **(S)**.\n    *   **C4:** Priorities are C3 > C5 > CH₃ > H. The H is \"down\" (dash). The path C3 → C5 → CH₃ is clockwise. Thus, C4 is **(R)**.\n    *   **C5:** Priorities are C4 > C6 > CH₃ > H. The H is \"down\" (dash). The path C4 → C6 → CH₃ is counter-clockwise. Thus, C5 is **(S)**.\n    *   **C6:** Priorities are C1 > C5 > CH₃ > H. The H is \"down\" (dash). The path C1 → C5 → CH₃ is clockwise. Thus, C6 is **(R)**.\n*   The resulting enantiomer is **(1S,4R,5S,6R)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol**.\n\n**Step 5: Match with Options**\n*   The calculated structure and stereochemistry, (1S,4R,5S,6R)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol, perfectly matches option D. The reaction must proceed through the exo transition state to yield the product described in the options.\n\n<<<D>>>"
