A benzene ring itself accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one ring and three pi bonds). The remaining degree of unsaturation points to one additional pi bond, which, given the two oxygen atoms, is almost certainly a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n*   **Bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** This pair of distinct, medium-to-strong bands is the definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. The two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **Careful Point:** The presence of *two* bands is crucial. A secondary amine or amide (-NH-) would show only one band in this region. This observation immediately rules out any structure that is not a primary amine, such as **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**, which is a secondary amide.\n*   **Band at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption indicating a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n*   **Careful Point:** The frequency of this band is key to identifying the type of carbonyl. A value of ~1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring (Ar-COOR). This frequency is generally too high for a conjugated amide (like **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide**, which would be <1700 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester (like **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate**, which would be ~1760 cm⁻¹).\n\n### **Step 3: Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination is the classic pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The triplet (t) is the methyl group, and the quartet (q) is the methylene group.\n*   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the most decisive signal in the spectrum. This significant downfield shift indicates the methylene (-CH₂-) group is directly attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester, confirming an **ethyl ester fragment (-O-CH₂CH₃)**. This single piece of data rules out the isomer **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate**, where the methylene group would be next to the carbonyl (-CO-CH₂CH₃) and would appear as a quartet around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet (bs), integrating to two protons, confirms the presence of the **primary amine (-NH₂)** group identified in the IR spectrum. The broadness is a typical feature of exchangeable protons.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region.\n*   **Careful Point:** The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. This rules out any meta-substituted structures like **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide**. The difference in chemical shifts confirms that the two substituents have opposing electronic effects: the electron-donating amine group (-NH₂) shields its adjacent protons (shifting them upfield to 7.0 ppm), while the electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt) deshields its adjacent protons (shifting them downfield to 8.0 ppm).\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe combined evidence from the molecular formula, IR spectrum, and ¹H NMR spectrum all converge on a single, unambiguous structure: a benzene ring substituted at the 1 and 4 positions with a primary amine group and an ethyl ester group. The name of this compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nMatching this confirmed structure to the provided list of options:\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all spectral data.\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide.\n*   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Incorrect. This is an isomer with a different ester linkage, which is inconsistent with the NMR data.\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, not a primary amine.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided spectroscopic data and a review of the candidate answers, the correct compound is identified through the following step-by-step process.\n\n### **Step 1: Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The first step is to calculate the DoU to determine the total number of rings and pi bonds. The formula is DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 is a very strong indicator of a benzene ring, which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one ring and three pi bonds).

The discrepancy in the final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) is due to the options being presented in a different order to each agent, not due to any error in the chemical reasoning. The core analysis is sound across all responses.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Spectroscopic Analysis**\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂\n*   **DoU Calculation:** The Degree of Unsaturation is calculated using the formula: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 is a classic indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: one ring and three pi bonds) plus one additional pi bond. Given the two oxygen atoms, this extra pi bond is almost certainly a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **Bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** This pair of distinct bands is the definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **Careful Point:** The presence of *two* bands is crucial. A secondary amine or amide (-NH-) would show only one band in this region. This observation immediately rules out option **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**, which is a secondary amide.\n*   **Band at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption indicates a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n*   **Careful Point:** The frequency is highly diagnostic for the type of carbonyl. A value of ~1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring (Ar-COOR). This frequency is generally too high for a conjugated amide (like option A, ~1680 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester (like option B, Ar-O-COR, ~1760 cm⁻¹). This strongly points towards an ethyl benzoate structure over the other options.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This is the unmistakable pattern of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the most decisive signal in the spectrum. A methylene (-CH₂-) group is shifted this far downfield only when it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an ester oxygen **(-O-CH₂CH₃)**. This confirms the structure is an **ethyl ester**. This single data point definitively rules out the isomer **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate**, where the methylene group would be next to the carbonyl (-CO-CH₂CH₃) and would appear as a quartet around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) that integrates to two protons is a characteristic signal for the two exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, confirming the interpretation from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n*   **Careful Point:** This para-substitution pattern rules out the meta-substituted **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide**. The difference in chemical shifts also confirms the substituent identities: the electron-donating -NH₂ group shields its ortho protons, shifting them upfield (7.0 ppm), while the electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt) deshields its ortho protons, shifting them downfield (8.0 ppm).\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe combined evidence from the molecular formula, IR spectrum, and ¹H NMR spectrum all converge on a single, unambiguous structure: a benzene ring substituted at the 1 and 4 positions with a primary amine group and an ethyl ester group. The name of this compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nMatching this confirmed structure to the provided list of options:\n*   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect (meta-substituted amide).\n*   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect (Isomer with wrong NMR shift for the ethyl group).\n*   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect (Secondary amide, not primary amine/ester).\n*   D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: **Correct.** This name and structure perfectly match all spectral data.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided candidate answers and a detailed, step-by-step evaluation of the spectroscopic data, the correct compound is identified as follows.\n\n### **Analysis of Candidate Answers**\nAll provided candidate answers perform a correct and consistent chemical analysis of the spectral data.

A value of ~1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring (Ar-COOR). This frequency is too high for a typical conjugated amide like option D (3-ethoxybenzamide), which would appear around 1680 cm⁻¹, and too low for a phenyl ester like option B (4-aminophenyl propionate), which would appear around 1760 cm⁻¹. This strongly suggests an ethyl benzoate structure over the other options.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This is the unmistakable pattern of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the most decisive signal in the spectrum. A methylene (-CH₂-) group this far downfield must be attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH₂CH₃). This confirms the presence of an **ethyl ester** fragment and definitively rules out the isomer, option B (4-aminophenyl propionate), where the methylene group would be adjacent to the carbonyl (-CO-CH₂CH₃) and would appear as a quartet much further upfield, around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons confirms the presence of the **primary amine (-NH₂)**, corroborating the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n*   **Careful Point:** This para-substitution pattern rules out option D (3-ethoxybenzamide), which is meta-substituted and would show a more complex splitting pattern.

Consensus Among Candidate Answers**\nAll provided answers, despite having different final letter choices, reach the same unanimous conclusion on the chemical structure of the unknown compound. They all correctly identify it as **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. The discrepancy in the final letter choice (A, B, C, or D) is due to the options being presented in a different order to each agent, not due to any error in the chemical reasoning. The following analysis will independently verify this conclusion and match it to the specific option list provided in the question.\n\n### **2. Step-by-Step Spectroscopic Analysis**\n\n**Step I: Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   The molecular formula is **C₉H₁₁NO₂**.\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5.\n*   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 is a classic indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional pi bond. Given the two oxygen atoms, this is almost certainly a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**Step II: IR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   The two bands at **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹** are a definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **Careful Point:** The presence of *two* distinct peaks is crucial. A secondary amine or amide, like option A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, would only show one N-H band. This observation immediately rules out option A.\n*   The strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹** indicates a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n*   **Careful Point:** The frequency of this band is highly diagnostic. A value of ~1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring (Ar-COOR). This frequency is too high for a conjugated amide (like option C, ~1680 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester (like option D, Ar-O-CO-R, ~1760 cm⁻¹). This strongly suggests an ester structure and disfavors the amide and phenyl ester isomers.\n\n**Step III: ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   The signals at **7.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **8.0 ppm (d, 2H)** indicate a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The two doublets, each integrating to two protons, are a hallmark of this substitution pattern.\n*   **Careful Point:** This para-substitution pattern rules out option C) 3-ethoxybenzamide, which is meta-substituted and would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region.\n*   The signals at **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)** and **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)** represent a classic **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the most decisive piece of data. A methylene (-CH₂-) group this far downfield must be attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester, confirming an **ethyl ester fragment (-O-CH₂CH₃)**. This single data point definitively rules out the isomer D) 4-aminophenyl propionate, where the ethyl group is part of a propionate chain (-CO-CH₂CH₃). In that case, the quartet would appear much further upfield, around 2.5 ppm.\n*   The signal at **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)** is a broad singlet for two protons, characteristic of the exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, confirming the IR data.\n\n### **3.

Ruled out by the NMR aromatic pattern and IR C=O frequency.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound from the provided spectral data.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C₉H₁₁NO₂**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The first step is to calculate the DoU to determine the number of rings and pi bonds.\n    *   The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   Plugging in the values: DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a very strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: one ring and three pi bonds) plus one additional pi bond. Given the two oxygen atoms, this extra pi bond is almost certainly a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### **2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** This pair of distinct bands is a definitive signature for a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. The two bands arise from the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This observation immediately rules out any structures that are not primary amines. This eliminates option **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**, which is a secondary amide and would only show one N-H band.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The frequency is crucial for distinguishing between carbonyl types. A value of ~1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring (Ar-COOR). It is generally too high for a conjugated amide (like option C, ~1680 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester (like option B, Ar-O-COR, ~1760 cm⁻¹). This makes an ester structure highly likely.\n\n### **3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination is the classic pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is highly significant. Such a downfield shift indicates the methylene (-CH₂-) group is attached to a very electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester, confirming an **ethyl ester fragment (-O-CH₂CH₃)**. If the ethyl group were part of a propionate chain (as in option B, -CO-CH₂CH₃), the quartet would appear much further upfield (~2.5 ppm). This definitively rules out **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate**.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet, integrating to two protons, is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, corroborating the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This para-substitution pattern rules out any meta-substituted isomers like **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide**. The difference in chemical shifts also confirms the electronic nature of the substituents: the electron-donating amine group (-NH₂) shields its adjacent protons, shifting them upfield to 7.0 ppm, while the electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt) deshields its adjacent protons, shifting them downfield to 8.0 ppm.\n\n### **4.

This single piece of data definitively rules out the isomer **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate**, where the methylene group would be next to the carbonyl (-CO-CH₂CH₃) and would appear as a quartet around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet, integrating to two protons, confirms the presence of the **primary amine (-NH₂)** group identified in the IR spectrum. The broadness is a typical feature of exchangeable protons.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region.\n*   **Careful Point:** The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. This rules out any meta-substituted structures like **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide**. The difference in chemical shifts confirms that the two substituents have opposing electronic effects: the electron-donating amine group (-NH₂) shields its adjacent protons (shifting them upfield to 7.0 ppm), while the electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt) deshields its adjacent protons (shifting them downfield to 8.0 ppm).\n\n### **Conclusion**\nAll pieces of evidence from the molecular formula, IR spectrum, and ¹H NMR spectrum converge on a single, unambiguous structure: a benzene ring with a primary amine group and an ethyl ester group in a 1,4 (para) arrangement. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nMatching this confirmed structure to the provided list of options:\n*   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect (meta-substituted amide).\n*   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect (isomer with a different ester linkage, inconsistent with NMR).\n*   C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: **Correct.** This structure perfectly matches all spectral data.\n*   D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect (secondary amide).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on a systematic analysis of the provided spectroscopic data, the correct compound is identified by evaluating each piece of evidence.\n\n### **Step 1: Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C₉H₁₁NO₂) and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is calculated to determine the number of rings and pi bonds in the molecule. The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n*   Calculation: DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 is a classic indicator of a substituted benzene ring. A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one ring and three pi bonds). The remaining degree of unsaturation points to one additional pi bond, which, given the two oxygen atoms in the formula, is almost certainly a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** This pair of distinct, medium-to-strong bands is the definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. The two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **Careful Point:** The presence of *two* bands is crucial. A secondary amine or amide (-NH-) would show only one band in this region. This observation immediately rules out **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**, which is a secondary amide.\n*   **Band at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region.\n*   **Careful Point:** The frequency is key to identifying the type of carbonyl. A value of ~1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring (Ar-COOR). This frequency is generally too high for a conjugated amide (like in option C, ~1680 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester (like in option B, Ar-O-COR, ~1760 cm⁻¹). This strongly suggests an ester functional group.\n\n### **Step 3: Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination is the unmistakable pattern of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the most decisive signal in the spectrum. A methylene group (-CH₂-) is shifted this far downfield only when it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an ester oxygen (-O-CH₂-). This confirms the structure is an **ethyl ester** (Ar-COOCH₂CH₃). This single data point definitively rules out the isomer **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate**, where the ethyl group is part of a propionyl group (-CO-CH₂CH₃) and the quartet would appear much further upfield, around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) that integrates to two protons is a characteristic signal for the two exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, confirming the interpretation from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets (d), each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n*   **Careful Point:** This para-substitution pattern rules out **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide**, which is meta-substituted and would give a more complex splitting pattern. The difference in chemical shifts also confirms the substituent identities: the electron-donating -NH₂ group shields its ortho protons, shifting them upfield (7.0 ppm), while the electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt) deshields its ortho protons, shifting them downfield (8.0 ppm).\n\n### **Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n\nThe combined evidence from the molecular formula, IR spectrum, and ¹H NMR spectrum all converge on a single, unambiguous structure: a benzene ring substituted at the 1 and 4 positions with a primary amine group and an ethyl ester group. The name of this compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nMatching this confirmed structure to the provided list of options:\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all spectral data.\n*   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. This is an isomer ruled out by the NMR chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm.\n*   C) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide, inconsistent with the IR and NMR data.\n*   D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, inconsistent with the IR and NMR data for a primary amine.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nBased on a systematic analysis of the provided spectroscopic data, the correct compound is identified through the following step-by-step process.\n\n### **1.

If the ethyl group were part of a propionate chain (as in option D, -CO-CH₂CH₃), the quartet would appear much further upfield (~2.5 ppm). This definitively rules out **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate**.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet, integrating to two protons, is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, corroborating the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n*   **Careful Point:** This para-substitution pattern rules out any meta-substituted isomers like **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide**. The difference in chemical shifts also confirms the electronic nature of the substituents: the electron-donating amine group (-NH₂) shields its adjacent protons, shifting them upfield to 7.0 ppm, while the electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt) deshields its adjacent protons, shifting them downfield to 8.0 ppm.\n\n### **4. Conclusion**\n\nThe combined evidence from all spectra points unequivocally to a single structure: a benzene ring with a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group in a 1,4 (para) arrangement. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nMatching this identified structure to the given options:\n*   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect (secondary amide).\n*   B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: **Correct.** This structure perfectly matches all spectral data.\n*   C) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect (meta-substituted amide).\n*   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect (isomer with wrong NMR shift).\n\n<<<B>>>"

A benzene ring itself accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one ring and three pi bonds). The remaining degree of unsaturation points to one additional pi bond, which, given the two oxygen atoms, is almost certainly a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n*   **Bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** This pair of distinct, medium-to-strong bands is the definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. The two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **Careful Point:** The presence of *two* bands is crucial. A secondary amine or amide (-NH-) would show only one band in this region. This observation immediately rules out any structure that is not a primary amine, such as **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**, which is a secondary amide.\n*   **Band at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption indicating a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n*   **Careful Point:** The frequency of this band is key to identifying the type of carbonyl. A value of ~1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring (Ar-COOR). This frequency is generally too high for a conjugated amide (like **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide**, which would be <1700 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester (like **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate**, which would be ~1760 cm⁻¹).\n\n### **Step 3: Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination is the classic pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The triplet (t) is the methyl group, and the quartet (q) is the methylene group.\n*   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the most decisive signal in the spectrum. This significant downfield shift indicates the methylene (-CH₂-) group is directly attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester, confirming an **ethyl ester fragment (-O-CH₂CH₃)**. This single piece of data rules out the isomer **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate**, where the methylene group would be next to the carbonyl (-CO-CH₂CH₃) and would appear as a quartet around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet (bs), integrating to two protons, confirms the presence of the **primary amine (-NH₂)** group identified in the IR spectrum. The broadness is a typical feature of exchangeable protons.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region.\n*   **Careful Point:** The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.

This significant downfield shift indicates the methylene (-CH₂-) group is directly attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester, confirming an **ethyl ester fragment (-O-CH₂CH₃)**. This single piece of data definitively rules out the isomer **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate**, where the methylene group would be next to the carbonyl (-CO-CH₂CH₃) and would appear as a quartet around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet, integrating to two protons, confirms the presence of the **primary amine (-NH₂)** group identified in the IR spectrum. The broadness is a typical feature of exchangeable protons.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region.\n*   **Careful Point:** The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. This rules out any meta-substituted structures like **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide**. The difference in chemical shifts confirms that the two substituents have opposing electronic effects: the electron-donating amine group (-NH₂) shields its adjacent protons (shifting them upfield to 7.0 ppm), while the electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt) deshields its adjacent protons (shifting them downfield to 8.0 ppm).\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAll pieces of evidence from the molecular formula, IR spectrum, and ¹H NMR spectrum converge on a single, unambiguous structure: a benzene ring with a primary amine group and an ethyl ester group in a 1,4 (para) arrangement.

There is a unanimous consensus among all agents that the unknown compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. The discrepancy in the final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) is due to the options being presented in a different order to each agent, not due to any error in the chemical reasoning.

Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂\n*   **DoU Calculation:** The Degree of Unsaturation is calculated using the formula: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 is a classic indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: one ring and three pi bonds) plus one additional pi bond. Given the two oxygen atoms, this extra pi bond is almost certainly a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **Bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** This pair of distinct bands is the definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **Careful Point:** The presence of *two* bands is crucial. A secondary amine or amide (-NH-) would show only one band in this region. This observation immediately rules out option **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**, which is a secondary amide.\n*   **Band at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption indicates a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n*   **Careful Point:** The frequency is highly diagnostic for the type of carbonyl. A value of ~1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring (Ar-COOR). This frequency is generally too high for a conjugated amide (like option A, ~1680 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester (like option B, Ar-O-COR, ~1760 cm⁻¹). This strongly points towards an ethyl benzoate structure over the other options.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This is the unmistakable pattern of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the most decisive signal in the spectrum. A methylene (-CH₂-) group is shifted this far downfield only when it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an ester oxygen **(-O-CH₂CH₃)**. This confirms the structure is an **ethyl ester**. This single data point definitively rules out the isomer **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate**, where the methylene group would be next to the carbonyl (-CO-CH₂CH₃) and would appear as a quartet around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) that integrates to two protons is a characteristic signal for the two exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, confirming the interpretation from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n*   **Careful Point:** This para-substitution pattern rules out the meta-substituted **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide**. The difference in chemical shifts also confirms the substituent identities: the electron-donating -NH₂ group shields its ortho protons, shifting them upfield (7.0 ppm), while the electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt) deshields its ortho protons, shifting them downfield (8.0 ppm).\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe combined evidence from the molecular formula, IR spectrum, and ¹H NMR spectrum all converge on a single, unambiguous structure: a benzene ring substituted at the 1 and 4 positions with a primary amine group and an ethyl ester group.

They all correctly identify it as **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. The discrepancy in the final letter choice (A, B, C, or D) is due to the options being presented in a different order to each agent, not due to any error in the chemical reasoning. The following analysis will independently verify this conclusion and match it to the specific option list provided in the question.\n\n### **2.

A secondary amine or amide, like option A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, would only show one N-H band. This observation immediately rules out option A.\n*   The strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹** indicates a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n*   **Careful Point:** The frequency of this band is highly diagnostic. A value of ~1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring (Ar-COOR). This frequency is too high for a conjugated amide (like option C, ~1680 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester (like option D, Ar-O-CO-R, ~1760 cm⁻¹).

A methylene (-CH₂-) group this far downfield must be attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester, confirming an **ethyl ester fragment (-O-CH₂CH₃)**. This single data point definitively rules out the isomer D) 4-aminophenyl propionate, where the ethyl group is part of a propionate chain (-CO-CH₂CH₃). In that case, the quartet would appear much further upfield, around 2.5 ppm.\n*   The signal at **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)** is a broad singlet for two protons, characteristic of the exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, confirming the IR data.\n\n### **3.

Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C₉H₁₁NO₂**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The first step is to calculate the DoU to determine the number of rings and pi bonds.\n    *   The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   Plugging in the values: DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a very strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: one ring and three pi bonds) plus one additional pi bond. Given the two oxygen atoms, this extra pi bond is almost certainly a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### **2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** This pair of distinct bands is a definitive signature for a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. The two bands arise from the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This observation immediately rules out any structures that are not primary amines. This eliminates option **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**, which is a secondary amide and would only show one N-H band.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The frequency is crucial for distinguishing between carbonyl types. A value of ~1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring (Ar-COOR). It is generally too high for a conjugated amide (like option C, ~1680 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester (like option B, Ar-O-COR, ~1760 cm⁻¹). This makes an ester structure highly likely.\n\n### **3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination is the classic pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is highly significant. Such a downfield shift indicates the methylene (-CH₂-) group is attached to a very electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester, confirming an **ethyl ester fragment (-O-CH₂CH₃)**. If the ethyl group were part of a propionate chain (as in option B, -CO-CH₂CH₃), the quartet would appear much further upfield (~2.5 ppm). This definitively rules out **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate**.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet, integrating to two protons, is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, corroborating the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This para-substitution pattern rules out any meta-substituted isomers like **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide**. The difference in chemical shifts also confirms the electronic nature of the substituents: the electron-donating amine group (-NH₂) shields its adjacent protons, shifting them upfield to 7.0 ppm, while the electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt) deshields its adjacent protons, shifting them downfield to 8.0 ppm.\n\n### **4.

This is a meta-substituted amide, which is inconsistent with the IR data for an ester and the NMR data for para-substitution.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nBased on a systematic analysis of the provided spectroscopic data, the correct compound is identified through the following step-by-step process.\n\n### **Step 1: Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C₉H₁₁NO₂) and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   The molecular formula is C₉H₁₁NO₂.\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is calculated to determine the total number of rings and pi bonds using the formula: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 is a very strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: one ring and three pi bonds) plus one additional pi bond. Given the two oxygen atoms in the formula, this extra pi bond is almost certainly a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n*   **Bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** This pair of distinct, medium-to-strong bands is the definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. The two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **Careful Point:** The presence of *two* bands is crucial. A secondary amine or amide, such as **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**, would show only one N-H band in this region and is therefore incorrect.\n*   **Band at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption indicating a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n*   **Careful Point:** The frequency of this band is key to identifying the type of carbonyl. A value of ~1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring (Ar-COOR). This frequency is generally too high for a conjugated amide like **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide** (~1680 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester like **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate** (~1760 cm⁻¹). This strongly suggests the compound is a conjugated ester.\n\n### **Step 3: Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination is the classic pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the most decisive signal in the spectrum. This significant downfield shift indicates the methylene (-CH₂-) group is directly attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester, confirming an **ethyl ester fragment (-O-CH₂CH₃)**. This single piece of data definitively rules out the isomer **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate**, where the methylene group would be next to the carbonyl (-CO-CH₂CH₃) and would appear as a quartet around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet, integrating to two protons, confirms the presence of the **primary amine (-NH₂)** group identified in the IR spectrum. The broadness is a typical feature of exchangeable protons.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region.\n*   **Careful Point:** The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. This rules out any meta-substituted structures like **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide**. The difference in chemical shifts confirms that the two substituents have opposing electronic effects: the electron-donating amine group (-NH₂) shields its adjacent protons (shifting them upfield to 7.0 ppm), while the electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt) deshields its adjacent protons (shifting them downfield to 8.0 ppm).\n\n### **Conclusion**\nAll pieces of evidence from the molecular formula, IR spectrum, and ¹H NMR spectrum converge on a single, unambiguous structure: a benzene ring with a primary amine group and an ethyl ester group in a 1,4 (para) arrangement. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nMatching this confirmed structure to the provided list of options:\n*   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect (meta-substituted amide).\n*   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect (isomer with a different ester linkage, inconsistent with NMR).\n*   C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: **Correct.** This structure perfectly matches all spectral data.\n*   D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect (secondary amide).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on a systematic analysis of the provided spectroscopic data, the correct compound is identified by evaluating each piece of evidence.\n\n### **Step 1: Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C₉H₁₁NO₂) and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is calculated to determine the number of rings and pi bonds in the molecule. The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n*   Calculation: DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 is a classic indicator of a substituted benzene ring. A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one ring and three pi bonds). The remaining degree of unsaturation points to one additional pi bond, which, given the two oxygen atoms in the formula, is almost certainly a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** This pair of distinct, medium-to-strong bands is the definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. The two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **Careful Point:** The presence of *two* bands is crucial. A secondary amine or amide (-NH-) would show only one band in this region. This observation immediately rules out **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**, which is a secondary amide.\n*   **Band at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region.\n*   **Careful Point:** The frequency is key to identifying the type of carbonyl. A value of ~1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring (Ar-COOR). This frequency is generally too high for a conjugated amide (like in option C, ~1680 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester (like in option B, Ar-O-COR, ~1760 cm⁻¹). This strongly suggests an ester functional group.\n\n### **Step 3: Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination is the unmistakable pattern of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the most decisive signal in the spectrum. A methylene group (-CH₂-) is shifted this far downfield only when it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an ester oxygen (-O-CH₂-). This confirms the structure is an **ethyl ester** (Ar-COOCH₂CH₃). This single data point definitively rules out the isomer **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate**, where the ethyl group is part of a propionyl group (-CO-CH₂CH₃) and the quartet would appear much further upfield, around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) that integrates to two protons is a characteristic signal for the two exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, confirming the interpretation from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets (d), each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n*   **Careful Point:** This para-substitution pattern rules out **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide**, which is meta-substituted and would give a more complex splitting pattern. The difference in chemical shifts also confirms the substituent identities: the electron-donating -NH₂ group shields its ortho protons, shifting them upfield (7.0 ppm), while the electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt) deshields its ortho protons, shifting them downfield (8.0 ppm).\n\n### **Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n\nThe combined evidence from the molecular formula, IR spectrum, and ¹H NMR spectrum all converge on a single, unambiguous structure: a benzene ring substituted at the 1 and 4 positions with a primary amine group and an ethyl ester group. The name of this compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nMatching this confirmed structure to the provided list of options:\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all spectral data.\n*   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect.
