A standard E2 elimination to form a double bond at a bridgehead carbon is forbidden by Bredt's rule. The harsh conditions (strong base, high temperature) are known to induce skeletal rearrangements.\n*   **Careful Point 2 (Spectroscopic Data Interpretation):** The provided data is definitive.\n    *   The IR absorbance at **1720 cm⁻¹** is a clear indicator of a ketone (C=O) functional group.\n    *   The ¹H NMR signal at **4.79 ppm (2H)** is characteristic of vinylic protons on an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂).\n*   **Conclusion for Product 1:** To accommodate a ketone, a double bond, and the molecular formula C₁₀H₁₄O, the tricyclic adamantane cage must have opened to form a bicyclic system. The only chemically plausible reaction that accounts for all the spectral data is a **Grob fragmentation**. The resulting structure is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide.\n*   **Careful Point 3 (Reagent Selectivity):** This reaction is a **Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction**. It is a highly selective method for reducing ketones to alcohols and, crucially, does not affect carbon-carbon double bonds.\n*   **Conclusion for Product 2:** The ketone at position C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group. Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Careful Point 4 (Reaction Type):** This is a standard **reductive ozonolysis**. This reaction cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond. The dimethylsulfide serves as a mild reducing agent in the workup to convert the intermediate ozonide into carbonyl compounds.\n*   **Conclusion for Product 3:** The exocyclic double bond (=CH₂) at position C7 is cleaved to form a ketone (=O). The alcohol group at C3 is unaffected. The final product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n*   **Question:** What is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding those that will exchange with deuterated solvent)?\n*   **Careful Point 5 (Identifying the Correct Proton):** In the final product, the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton is the one attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, **H-C3**). The strong electron-withdrawing effect of the adjacent oxygen atom shifts its signal significantly downfield.\n*   **Careful Point 6 (Recognizing Molecular Symmetry):** The final product, bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one, possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through atoms C3 and C7. This symmetry is essential for correctly determining the coupling pattern as it makes the two halves of the molecule chemically equivalent.\n*   **Careful Point 7 (Analyzing the Coupling Environment):**\n    *   The carbinol proton (H-C3) is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4.\n    *   Because of the plane of symmetry, H-C3 is coupled to two distinct sets of two equivalent protons:\n        1.  A pair of equivalent *axial-like* protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n        2.  A pair of equivalent *equatorial-like* protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n    *   The coupling constant to the axial-like pair (J_A) will be different from the coupling constant to the equatorial-like pair (J_B).\n*   **Conclusion on the Coupling Pattern:** According to the n+1 rule for complex splitting, coupling to the first pair of equivalent protons (n=2) splits the signal into a **triplet**. Each line of this triplet is then further split by the second pair of equivalent protons (n=2) into another **triplet**. The resulting observable pattern is a **triplet of triplets**. A pentet would only arise if all four neighboring protons were magnetically equivalent (i.e., had the same coupling constant to H-C3), which is not the case here.\n\nMatching this conclusion to the provided options:\nA) triplet\nB) triplet of triplets\nC) pentet\nD) doublet of triplets\n\nThe correct answer is \"triplet of triplets\", which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the candidate answers, there is a unanimous consensus on the chemical transformations and the final spectroscopic analysis. The discrepancies between the answers lie only in the mapping of the correct chemical conclusion to the multiple-choice letter, likely due to variations in the option order presented to each agent. The chemical reasoning is sound and consistent across all responses.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis incorporating the critical points from the provided answers.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C.\n*   **Careful Point 1: Reaction Conditions and Substrate.** The starting material is a rigid, tricyclic adamantane cage. A standard E2 elimination to form a double bond at a bridgehead carbon is forbidden by Bredt's rule. The harsh conditions (strong base, high temperature) strongly suggest a skeletal rearrangement.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Spectroscopic Data Interpretation.** The provided data is definitive in identifying the product. The IR absorbance at **1720 cm⁻¹** confirms the presence of a ketone (C=O). The ¹H NMR signal at **4.79 ppm (2H)** is characteristic of an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂).\n*   **Conclusion:** The only reaction that opens the adamantane cage to form a bicyclic product consistent with all the spectral data is a **Grob fragmentation**. The resulting structure of Product 1 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Structure of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Reagent Selectivity.** This reaction is a **Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction**. It is a highly chemoselective method for reducing ketones to alcohols and, crucially, does not affect carbon-carbon double bonds.\n*   **Conclusion:** The ketone at position C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group. Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Careful Point 4: Understanding Ozonolysis.** This is a standard **reductive ozonolysis**. This reaction cleaves the C=C double bond. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) is converted into a ketone (=O) at position C7, while the alcohol group at C3 remains unchanged.\n*   **Conclusion:** The final product, Product 3, is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol-7-one**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n*   **Question:** What is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding those that will exchange with deuterated solvent)?\n*   **Careful Point 5: Identifying the Correct Proton.** The most deshielded non-exchangeable proton is the one on the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton, **H-C3**). The electronegative oxygen atom pulls electron density away from this proton, shifting its signal significantly downfield.\n*   **Careful Point 6: Recognizing Molecular Symmetry.** The final product possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through atoms C3 and C7. This symmetry is essential for determining the equivalence of neighboring protons.\n*   **Careful Point 7: Analyzing the Coupling Environment.** The carbinol proton (H-C3) is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4. Due to the plane of symmetry, H-C3 is coupled to two distinct sets of two equivalent protons:\n    1.  A pair of equivalent *axial-like* protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n    2.  A pair of equivalent *equatorial-like* protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n    The coupling constant to the axial-like pair (J_A) will be different from the coupling constant to the equatorial-like pair (J_B).\n*   **Conclusion on the Coupling Pattern:** Since H-C3 is coupled to two *different* sets of equivalent protons, the n+1 rule is applied sequentially. Coupling to the first pair of two equivalent protons (n=2) splits the signal into a **triplet**. Each line of this triplet is then further split by the second pair of two equivalent protons (n=2) into another **triplet**. The resulting observable pattern is a **triplet of triplets**. A pentet would only arise if all four neighboring protons were magnetically equivalent, which is not the case in this rigid structure.\n\nMatching the derived pattern, \"triplet of triplets\", to the provided options:\nA) doublet of triplets\nB) pentet\nC) triplet of triplets\nD) triplet\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to solve this multi-step organic chemistry problem by first establishing the structure of each intermediate product based on the reaction conditions and spectroscopic data provided.

A standard E2 elimination to form a double bond at a bridgehead carbon is forbidden by Bredt's rule, which states that a double bond cannot be placed at a bridgehead of a small bicyclic system because it would introduce too much ring strain. The harsh conditions suggest a skeletal rearrangement.\n    *   **Careful Point (Spectroscopy):** The spectroscopic data for Product 1 is definitive. The IR absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of a ketone (C=O).

This reaction is highly chemoselective, reducing ketones and aldehydes to alcohols while leaving other functional groups, such as carbon-carbon double bonds, untouched.\n    *   **Conclusion (Product 2):** The ketone at position C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group. Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n3.  **Step 3: From Product 2 to Product 3**\n    *   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) at low temperature, followed by a workup with dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n    *   **Careful Point (Reaction Type):** This is a **reductive ozonolysis**.

This symmetry is crucial for determining the equivalence of neighboring protons.\n    *   **Careful Point (Coupling Environment):** The carbinol proton (H-C3) is coupled to the protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4. Due to the plane of symmetry, the two protons on C2 are chemically equivalent to the two protons on C4. However, within each CH₂ group, the two protons (one axial-like, one equatorial-like) are diastereotopic and thus not equivalent to each other. Therefore, H-C3 is coupled to two distinct sets of two equivalent protons:\n        1.  A pair of equivalent axial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n        2.  A pair of equivalent equatorial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n    *   **Conclusion (Splitting Pattern):** Since H-C3 is coupled to two different sets of equivalent protons with different coupling constants (J_axial ≠ J_equatorial), we apply the (n+1) rule sequentially. Coupling to the first pair of protons (n=2) splits the signal into a triplet. Each line of that triplet is then split again by the second pair of protons (n=2) into another triplet.

A pair of equivalent *axial-like* protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n        2.  A pair of equivalent *equatorial-like* protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n    *   The coupling constant to the axial-like pair (J_A) will be different from the coupling constant to the equatorial-like pair (J_B).\n*   **Determining the Splitting Pattern:** According to the n+1 rule for complex splitting, the signal is split sequentially.\n    1.  Coupling to the first pair of equivalent protons (n=2) splits the signal into a **triplet**.\n    2.

A standard elimination reaction to form a double bond at a bridgehead carbon is forbidden by Bredt's rule. The harsh conditions (strong base, high temperature) are known to induce skeletal rearrangements.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Analyzing the Spectroscopic Data.** The provided data is definitive for structure elucidation.\n    *   The IR absorbance at **1720 cm⁻¹** is a clear indicator of a ketone (C=O) functional group.\n    *   The ¹H NMR signal at **4.79 ppm (2H)** is characteristic of vinylic protons on an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂).\n*   **Conclusion for Product 1:** To accommodate a ketone, a double bond, and the molecular formula C₁₀H₁₄O (deduced from the ¹H NMR integration), the tricyclic adamantane cage must have opened to form a bicyclic system.

Due to the plane of symmetry, the two protons on C2 are chemically equivalent to the two protons on C4. However, within each CH₂ group, the two protons (one axial-like, one equatorial-like) are diastereotopic and thus not equivalent to each other. Therefore, H-C3 is coupled to two distinct sets of two equivalent protons:\n        1.  A pair of equivalent axial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n        2.  A pair of equivalent equatorial-like protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n    *   **Conclusion (Splitting Pattern):** Since H-C3 is coupled to two different sets of equivalent protons with different coupling constants (J_axial ≠ J_equatorial), we apply the (n+1) rule sequentially. Coupling to the first pair of protons (n=2) splits the signal into a triplet. Each line of that triplet is then split again by the second pair of protons (n=2) into another triplet. The resulting pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe chemical reasoning consistently leads to the conclusion that the splitting pattern is a \"triplet of triplets\".

A standard E2 elimination to form a double bond at a bridgehead carbon is forbidden by Bredt's rule. The harsh conditions (strong base, high temperature) are known to induce skeletal rearrangements.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Spectroscopic Data Interpretation.** The provided data is definitive for structure elucidation.\n    *   The IR absorbance at **1720 cm⁻¹** is a clear indicator of a ketone (C=O) functional group.\n    *   The ¹H NMR signal at **4.79 ppm (2H)** is characteristic of vinylic protons on an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂).\n*   **Conclusion for Product 1:** To accommodate both a ketone and a double bond, the tricyclic adamantane cage must have opened to form a bicyclic system.

A pair of equivalent **equatorial-like** protons (one on C2, one on C4).\n    *   The coupling constant to the axial-like pair (J_A) will be different from the coupling constant to the equatorial-like pair (J_B).\n*   **Conclusion on the Coupling Pattern:** According to the n+1 rule for complex splitting, coupling to the first pair of equivalent protons (n=2) splits the signal into a **triplet**. Each line of this triplet is then further split by the second pair of equivalent protons (n=2) into another **triplet**. The resulting observable pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.
