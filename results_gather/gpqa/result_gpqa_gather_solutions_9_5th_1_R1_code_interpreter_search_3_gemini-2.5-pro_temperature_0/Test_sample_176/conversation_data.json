All agents correctly identify the necessary physical principles and follow the same logical path to the solution. The minor discrepancies in the final letter choice are due to the randomization of the options in their respective prompts, but the underlying physics and the calculated numerical result are consistent across all analyses.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal and Foundational Formula:** The objective is to find the luminosity ratio L₁/L₂. Since the stars are treated as black bodies, their luminosity is governed by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. The ratio of luminosities for the two stars is therefore:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n2.  **Calculate the Radius Term:** The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂). Squaring this ratio gives the first component of the equation:\n    (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = **2.25**\n\n3.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio (The Critical Step):** This is the most complex part of the problem and requires synthesizing Wien's Displacement Law with the Doppler Effect.\n    *   **Wien's Law** states that a star's temperature (T) is inversely proportional to the peak wavelength of the light it *emits* in its own rest frame (λ_emitted). This gives the temperature ratio: T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁.\n    *   The problem states the stars \"*appeared* brightest\" at the same wavelength. This crucial phrase refers to the *observed* peak wavelength (λ_obs), which is affected by the star's motion. Therefore, **λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂**.\n    *   The **Doppler Effect** connects the observed and emitted wavelengths: λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v_r/c).\n        *   For Star_1, with a radial velocity (v_r,₁) of 0, there is no Doppler shift: λ_obs,₁ = λ_emitted,₁.\n        *   For Star_2, with a radial velocity (v_r,₂) of 700 km/s, its light is redshifted: λ_obs,₂ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂/c).\n    *   Since the observed wavelengths are equal, we can set the expressions equal: λ_emitted,₁ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂/c).\n    *   To find the temperature ratio, we rearrange this equation to match the one from Wien's Law: λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c).\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is: **T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)**.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:** Substitute the derived radius and temperature ratios into the main luminosity formula:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)]⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)⁴\n\n    Now, plug in the numerical values (v_r,₂ = 700 km/s and c ≈ 300,000 km/s):\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1 + 700/300000)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.009365\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ **2.229**\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The calculated luminosity ratio is approximately 2.229.

The problem provides information about the *observed* wavelength (\"appeared brightest\"), but the temperature calculation via Wien's Law depends on the intrinsic *emitted* wavelength. The Doppler effect is the essential bridge between these two concepts.\n*   **The \"No-Doppler\" Trap:** A common mistake is to see that the observed wavelengths are the same and incorrectly assume the temperatures must also be the same (T₁ = T₂).

The core of the problem is to calculate the luminosity ratio of two stars, which requires combining three key physical principles: the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, Wien's Displacement Law, and the Doppler Effect.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Establish the Luminosity Ratio Formula:** The Stefan-Boltzmann Law (L ∝ R²T⁴) gives the primary formula for the ratio: L₁/L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴.\n2.  **Calculate the Radius Term:** The problem gives R₁/R₂ = 1.5. The radius term is therefore (1.5)², which is 2.25.\n3.  **Calculate the Temperature Term:** This is the most critical step.

This requires synthesizing three fundamental laws of physics:\n    *   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** This law states that a black body's total radiated power (luminosity, L) is proportional to its surface area (which depends on radius R squared) and the fourth power of its surface temperature (T). The formula for the ratio of luminosities is:\n        L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates a star's surface temperature (T) to the peak wavelength of its *emitted* radiation (λ_emitted). Temperature is inversely proportional to this wavelength (T ∝ 1/λ_emitted). Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n        T₁ / T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** This principle connects the *observed* wavelength (λ_obs) to the *emitted* wavelength (λ_emitted) based on the source's radial velocity (v_r). The formula is:\n        λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v_r/c)\n\n2.  **Calculate the Radius Term:** The problem states that R₁ = 1.5 * R₂.

The formula for the ratio of luminosities is:\n        L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law connects a black body's surface temperature (T) to the peak wavelength of its *emitted* radiation (λ_emitted). The temperature is inversely proportional to this wavelength (T ∝ 1/λ_emitted). Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n        T₁ / T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** This principle describes how the motion of a source affects the wavelength of light we *observe* (λ_obs). It connects the observed wavelength to the emitted wavelength. For a source moving with radial velocity (v_r), the formula is:\n        λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v_r/c)\n\n2.  **Calculate the Radius Term:** The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂). The first part of the luminosity ratio is therefore:\n    (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = **2.25**\n\n3.  **Calculate the Temperature Term (The Critical Step):** This step requires careful distinction between observed and emitted wavelengths.\n    *   The problem states that the stars \"*appeared* brightest\" at the same wavelength.

This requires the application of three fundamental principles:\n    *   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** This law states that the luminosity (L) of a black body is proportional to its surface area (and thus its radius R squared) and the fourth power of its surface temperature (T). The formula for the ratio of luminosities is:\n        L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law connects a black body's surface temperature (T) to the peak wavelength of its *emitted* radiation (λ_emitted). The temperature is inversely proportional to this wavelength (T ∝ 1/λ_emitted). Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n        T₁ / T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** This principle describes how the motion of a source affects the wavelength of light we *observe* (λ_obs). It connects the observed wavelength to the emitted wavelength. For a source moving with radial velocity (v_r), the formula is:\n        λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v_r/c)\n\n2.  **Calculate the Radius Term:** The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂). The first part of the luminosity ratio is therefore:\n    (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = **2.25**\n\n3.  **Calculate the Temperature Term (The Critical Step):** This step requires careful distinction between observed and emitted wavelengths.\n    *   The problem states that the stars \"*appeared* brightest\" at the same wavelength. This crucial wording refers to the *observed* peak wavelength, meaning **λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂**.\n    *   We must use the Doppler effect to relate the observed wavelengths to the emitted wavelengths, which determine the temperature according to Wien's Law.\n    *   For Star_1, with a radial velocity of 0, there is no Doppler shift: **λ_obs,₁ = λ_emitted,₁**.\n    *   For Star_2, with a radial velocity of 700 km/s, its light is redshifted (its wavelength is stretched): **λ_obs,₂ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂/c)**.\n    *   Since the observed wavelengths are equal, we can set the two expressions equal to each other:\n        λ_emitted,₁ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂/c)\n    *   To find the temperature ratio, we need to rearrange this equation to find the ratio of emitted wavelengths (λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁):\n        λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n        **T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)**\n\n4.  **Combine Terms and Perform Final Calculation:** Now, we substitute the derived radius and temperature ratios into the main luminosity formula:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)]⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)⁴\n\n    Plugging in the numerical values (v_r,₂ = 700 km/s and c ≈ 300,000 km/s):\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1 + 700/300000)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.009365\n    **L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229**\n\n5.  **Compare with Options and Conclude:** The calculated luminosity ratio is approximately 2.229. Comparing this result to the given options:\n    *   A) ~2.23\n    *   B) ~2.35\n    *   C) ~2.32\n    *   D) ~2.25\n\n    The calculated value of 2.229 is closest to **2.23**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Observed vs. Emitted Wavelength:** The most crucial point is understanding that the problem gives information about the *observed* peak wavelength (\"appeared brightest\"), while Wien's Law for temperature requires the *emitted* (or intrinsic) peak wavelength. The Doppler effect is the essential link between these two quantities.\n*   **The \"No-Doppler\" Trap:** A common mistake is to see that the observed wavelengths are the same and incorrectly assume the temperatures are also the same (T₁ = T₂). This ignores the provided velocity data for Star_2 and leads to the incorrect answer of L₁/L₂ = 2.25 (Option D). The problem is specifically designed to test the application of the Doppler shift.\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The information about the mass ratio (M₁ = 1.5 * M₂) is irrelevant for a calculation based on black-body radiation principles (which relate luminosity, radius, and temperature) and serves only as a distractor.\n*   **Correct Exponents:** It is vital to remember the correct powers from the Stefan-Boltzmann law: the radius ratio is squared (²), and the temperature ratio is raised to the fourth power (⁴).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the candidate answers and the fundamental principles of astrophysics, the following is a definitive step-by-step solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal and Relevant Physical Laws:** The objective is to find the luminosity ratio, L₁/L₂, for two stars that are treated as black bodies. The solution requires the correct application and synthesis of three physical laws:\n    *   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** This law states that the total luminosity (L) of a black body is proportional to its radius squared (R²) and its surface temperature to the fourth power (T⁴). The formula for the ratio of luminosities is: L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates a star's surface temperature (T) to the peak wavelength of its *emitted* radiation (λ_emitted). Temperature is inversely proportional to this wavelength (T ∝ 1/λ_emitted), which means the temperature ratio is T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁.\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** This principle connects the *observed* wavelength (λ_obs) to the *emitted* wavelength (λ_emitted) based on the source's radial velocity (v_r). The formula is λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v_r/c).\n\n2.  **Calculate the Radius Term:** The problem states that R₁ = 1.5 * R₂. Therefore, the first part of the luminosity ratio formula is:\n    (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = **2.25**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Temperature Term (The Critical Step):** This step is the most complex and requires careful distinction between observed and emitted wavelengths.\n    *   The problem states the stars \"*appeared* brightest\" at the same wavelength. This refers to the **observed** peak wavelength, meaning λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂.\n    *   We must use the Doppler effect to relate this observation to the *emitted* wavelengths, which determine the temperature ratio according to Wien's Law.\n    *   For Star 1, with a radial velocity v_r,₁ = 0, there is no Doppler shift. Thus, its observed wavelength is equal to its emitted wavelength: λ_obs,₁ = λ_emitted,₁.\n    *   For Star 2, with a radial velocity v_r,₂ = 700 km/s, its light is redshifted. Its observed wavelength is given by: λ_obs,₂ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂/c).\n    *   Since the observed wavelengths are equal (λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂), we can set the expressions for them equal to each other: λ_emitted,₁ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r,₂/c).\n    *   To find the temperature ratio, we need the ratio of emitted wavelengths (λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁). Rearranging the equation gives: λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c).\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is **T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)**.\n\n4.  **Combine Terms and Calculate the Final Ratio:** Now, substitute the derived radius and temperature ratios into the main luminosity formula:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)]⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v_r,₂/c)⁴\n\n    Using the numerical values v_r,₂ = 700 km/s and the speed of light c ≈ 300,000 km/s:\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1 + 700/300000)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 / 1.009365\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ **2.229**\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The calculated luminosity ratio is approximately 2.229. Comparing this to the given options:\n    *   A) ~2.35\n    *   B) ~2.23\n    *   C) ~2.25\n    *   D) ~2.32\n\n    The calculated value of 2.229 is closest to 2.23.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Observed vs. Emitted Wavelength:** The most crucial point of the problem is distinguishing between the *observed* peak wavelength (what astronomers measure, given as equal) and the *emitted* peak wavelength (the star's intrinsic property, which determines its temperature via Wien's Law). The Doppler effect is the essential physical principle that connects these two quantities.\n*   **Ignoring the Doppler Effect (The \"Trap\"):** A common mistake is to assume that because the observed wavelengths are the same, the temperatures must also be the same. This ignores the provided velocity data for Star 2 and leads to the incorrect answer of L₁/L₂ = (1.5)² = 2.25. This value is intentionally included as option C to act as a distractor.\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The information about the stars' masses (M₁ = 1.5 * M₂) is irrelevant for a calculation based on the laws of black body radiation, which only concern luminosity, radius, and temperature. This information is a distractor.\n*   **Correct Exponents:** It is vital to remember the correct powers from the Stefan-Boltzmann law: the luminosity is proportional to the radius **squared** (R²) and the temperature to the **fourth power** (T⁴).\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",
