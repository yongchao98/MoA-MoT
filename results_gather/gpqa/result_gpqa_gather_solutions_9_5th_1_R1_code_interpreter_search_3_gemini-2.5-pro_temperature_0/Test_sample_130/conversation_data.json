This anhydride, which has a single peak (7 ppm) in its 1H NMR spectrum and two peaks (137 ppm, 165 ppm) in its 13C spectrum, was reacted with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to yield two products (a major and a minor product). Both products have a molecular formula of C13H16O3.\n\nThe 2D NOESY NMR spectra of the major and minor products were taken.

The spectroscopic data—a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm (equivalent vinylic protons) and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm (vinylic carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons)—is a classic fingerprint for the highly symmetric molecule **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**, which forms a bicyclic adduct.\n\nThis initial analysis is straightforward and agreed upon by all candidate answers.\n\n### **Step 2: Assign the ¹H NMR Signals**\n\nBased on the product's structure (a tetramethyl-substituted bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene anhydride) and the options provided, we can confidently assign the signals based on standard chemical shift principles:\n\n*   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** These are the two equivalent protons on the anhydride ring. They are on carbons adjacent to two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups, which deshields them significantly. Let's label them **H_anhydride**.\n*   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** These are the six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups attached to the C=C double bond (vinylic methyls). Let's label them **Me_alkene**.\n*   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This signal belongs to one of the two non-equivalent protons on the CH₂ bridge (the C7 position). It is a doublet due to geminal coupling with the other proton on the same carbon. Let's label it **H_bridge**.\n*   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** These are the six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups at the saturated bridgehead positions. They are in a more shielded, aliphatic environment. Let's label them **Me_bridgehead**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Major Product (The Critical Point)**\n\nThis is the most important step and the primary source of disagreement among the candidate answers. The Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomers: *endo* and *exo*.\n\n*   **The Alder-Endo Rule:** This rule predicts that the *endo* adduct is typically the major, kinetically favored product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions in the transition state.\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** This rule can be overridden by severe steric hindrance. The diene in this reaction, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is exceptionally bulky. For the *endo* product to form, the maleic anhydride must approach from the same face as the methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions, leading to a significant steric clash. The *exo* approach, from the opposite, more open face, is sterically much more favorable.\n*   **Conclusion:** In cases of such high steric hindrance, the *exo* pathway has a lower energy transition state and becomes the kinetically favored pathway. Therefore, for this specific reaction, the **major product is the *exo* adduct**, and the minor product is the *endo* adduct.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the 3D Structure and NOESY Spectrum**\n\nThe question asks for a NOESY cross-peak that is **present in the major product** but absent in the minor one. Based on our determination in Step 3, we must analyze the structure of the **major (*exo*) product**.\n\n*   **Major Product (*exo* isomer):** In the *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is positioned on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C7 bridge. This geometry forces the anhydride protons (**H_anhydride**) into the *endo* position of the bicyclic system, where they are tucked underneath the C=C double bond. This brings them into close spatial proximity with the vinylic methyl groups (**Me_alkene**). A strong NOESY cross-peak between **H_anhydride** and **Me_alkene** is expected.\n*   **Minor Product (*endo* isomer):** In the minor (*endo*) product, the anhydride ring would be on the same side (*syn*) as the C7 bridge. The **H_anhydride** protons would be in the *exo* position, far from the **Me_alkene** groups. Instead, they would be close to the **H_bridge** protons.\n\n### **Step 5: Final Decision**\n\nThe NOESY cross-peak that is unique to the major product must arise from the spatial proximity found only in the *exo* isomer. This is the interaction between the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl protons.\n\n*   **Interacting Protons:** **H_anhydride** and **Me_alkene**.\n*   **Corresponding Signals:** The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n\nThis combination of signals directly matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided answers and identifying the most chemically accurate conclusion.\n\n### **Step 1: Identification of Reactants and Reaction**\n\n*   **Dienophile:** The starting material is a *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid that is dehydrated to an anhydride. The spectroscopic data for this anhydride (¹H NMR: a single peak at 7 ppm; ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) is a classic fingerprint for the highly symmetric molecule **maleic anhydride**. The peaks correspond to the equivalent vinylic protons, vinylic carbons, and carbonyl carbons, respectively.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction between a diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**, which forms a bicyclic adduct.\n\n### **Step 2: Assignment of the ¹H NMR Signals**\n\nBased on the product's bicyclic structure and standard chemical shift principles, the signals provided in the options can be confidently assigned. This assignment is consistent across almost all candidate answers.\n\n*   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** These are the two equivalent protons on the anhydride ring. They are adjacent to two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups, which deshields them significantly. Let's label them **H_anhydride**.\n*   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups attached to the C=C double bond of the final product. Let's label them **Me_alkene**.\n*   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups at the saturated bridgehead positions. Let's label them **Me_bridgehead**.\n*   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This signal belongs to one of the two non-equivalent protons on the CH₂ bridge (the C7 position). It appears as a doublet due to geminal coupling with the other proton on the same carbon. Let's label it **H_bridge**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determination of the Major Product (The Critical Point of Analysis)**\n\nThis is the most crucial step and the primary source of disagreement among the candidate answers. The stereochemical outcome of the Diels-Alder reaction must be determined.\n\n*   **The Alder-Endo Rule:** This is a general rule of thumb stating that the *endo* adduct is typically the major, kinetically favored product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions in the transition state. Several candidate answers rely solely on this rule.\n*   **The Role of Steric Hindrance:** The endo rule can be overridden by severe steric hindrance. The diene in this problem, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is exceptionally bulky. For the *endo* product to form, the maleic anhydride must approach from the same face as the methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions. This approach creates a significant steric clash, raising the energy of the *endo* transition state.\n*   **Conclusion on Selectivity:** The *exo* approach, from the more open face of the diene, avoids this steric clash and therefore proceeds through a lower-energy transition state. In cases of such high steric hindrance, sterics dominate over secondary orbital effects. Therefore, the **major product is the *exo* adduct**, and the minor product is the *endo* adduct. The most accurate candidate answers (e.g., 1, 3, 5, 9, 13, 14) correctly identify this exception.\n\n### **Step 4: Analysis of 3D Structures and NOESY Data**\n\nA 2D NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). The question asks for a cross-peak that is **present in the major product** but absent (or very weak) in the minor product. Based on our conclusion from Step 3, we must analyze the structure of the **major (*exo*) adduct**.\n\n*   **Major Product (*exo* isomer):** In the *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is positioned on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C7 bridge. This geometry forces the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) into the *endo* position of the bicyclic system, where they are tucked underneath the C=C double bond. This brings them into close spatial proximity with the **Me_alkene** groups (~1.7 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak between them is expected.\n*   **Minor Product (*endo* isomer):** In the *endo* adduct, the anhydride ring is on the same side (*syn*) as the C7 bridge. The **H_anhydride** protons are in the *exo* position, far from the **Me_alkene** groups. Instead, they are close to the **H_bridge** protons (~1.5 ppm).\n\n### **Step 5: Final Decision**\n\nThe NOESY cross-peak that is unique to the major product must arise from the spatial proximity found only in the *exo* isomer. This is the interaction between the anhydride protons and the alkene methyl protons.\n\n*   **Interacting Protons:** **H_anhydride** and **Me_alkene**.\n*   **Corresponding Signals:** The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n\nThis combination of signals directly matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis problem requires a careful, step-by-step analysis of a Diels-Alder reaction, with a critical focus on stereochemistry and its manifestation in a 2D NOESY NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction**\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes an anhydride formed from a *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid. The spectroscopic data—a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm (for the two equivalent vinylic protons) and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm (vinylic carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons)—is a classic fingerprint for the highly symmetric molecule **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**, which forms a bicyclic adduct.\n\n### **Step 2: Assign the ¹H NMR Signals**\nBased on the product's structure and standard chemical shift principles, we can assign the proton signals provided in the options:\n*   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** These are the two equivalent protons on the anhydride ring. They are adjacent to two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups, which deshields them significantly. Let's label them **H_anhydride**.\n*   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups attached to the C=C double bond. Let's label them **Me_alkene**.\n*   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This is one of the two non-equivalent protons on the CH₂ bridge (the C7 position). It is a doublet due to geminal coupling with the other proton on the same carbon. Let's label it **H_bridge**.\n*   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups at the saturated bridgehead positions. Let's label them **Me_bridgehead**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Major Product (The Critical Step)**\nThis is the most important point of analysis. The Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n*   The **Alder-endo rule** generally predicts that the *endo* adduct is the major, kinetically favored product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions.\n*   However, this rule can be **overridden by severe steric hindrance**. The diene in this problem, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is extremely bulky. For the *endo* product to form, the maleic anhydride must approach from the same face as the methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions, leading to a significant steric clash.\n*   The *exo* approach, from the opposite and more open face, is sterically much more favorable. In cases of such high steric hindrance, sterics dominate the reaction pathway. Therefore, the **major product is the *exo* adduct**, and the minor product is the *endo* adduct.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the 3D Structures and NOESY Data**\nA 2D NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å).

The reaction can form two stereoisomers: *endo* and *exo*.\n*   **The Alder-endo Rule:** This rule predicts that the *endo* adduct is typically the major, kinetically favored product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions in the transition state. Several agents follow this rule.\n*   **Steric Hindrance as an Overriding Factor:** This general rule can be overridden by severe steric hindrance. The diene in this problem, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is extremely bulky.

The peaks correspond to the equivalent vinylic protons, vinylic carbons, and carbonyl carbons, respectively.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction between a diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**, which forms a bicyclic adduct.\n\n### **2.

They are adjacent to two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups, which deshields them significantly. Let's label them **H_anhydride**.\n*   **A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** These are the six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups attached to the C=C double bond (vinylic methyls). Let's label them **Me_alkene**.\n*   **A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This signal belongs to one of the two non-equivalent protons on the CH₂ bridge (the C7 position). It is a doublet due to geminal coupling with the other proton on the same carbon. Let's label it **H_bridge**.\n*   **A 6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** These are the six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups at the saturated bridgehead positions. They are in a more shielded, aliphatic environment. Let's label them **Me_bridgehead**.\n\n### **3. Determination of the Major Product (The Critical Step)**\n\nThis is the most important point of analysis. The Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n\n*   **The Alder-Endo Rule:** This rule states that the *endo* adduct is typically the major, kinetically favored product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions in the transition state.\n*   **Steric Hindrance as an Overriding Factor:** This rule can be overridden by severe steric hindrance. The diene in this reaction, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is exceptionally bulky. For the *endo* product to form, the maleic anhydride must approach from the same face as the methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions, leading to a significant steric clash. The *exo* approach, from the opposite, more open face, is sterically much more favorable and proceeds through a lower-energy transition state.\n*   **Conclusion on Selectivity:** Due to this overwhelming steric effect, the **major product is the *exo* adduct**, and the minor product is the *endo* adduct.

The question asks for a cross-peak that is **present in the major product** but absent or weak in the minor product. Based on our determination in Step 3, we must analyze the structure of the **major (*exo*) adduct**.\n\n*   **Major Product (*exo* isomer):** In the *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is positioned on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C7 bridge. This geometry forces the **H_anhydride** protons into the *endo* position of the bicyclic system, where they are tucked underneath the C=C double bond. This brings them into close spatial proximity with the **Me_alkene** groups. A strong NOESY cross-peak between **H_anhydride** and **Me_alkene** is expected.\n*   **Minor Product (*endo* isomer):** In the *endo* adduct, the anhydride ring is on the same side (*syn*) as the C7 bridge.

The spectroscopic data for this anhydride—a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm (for two equivalent vinylic protons) and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm (for two equivalent vinylic carbons) and 165 ppm (for two equivalent carbonyl carbons)—is a classic fingerprint for the highly symmetric molecule **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction between a diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**.

Analysis of the 3D Structure and NOESY Data**\n\nA 2D NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). The question asks for a cross-peak that is **present in the major product** but absent in the minor one. We must therefore analyze the structure of the **major (*exo*) product**.\n*   **In the major (*exo*) product:** The anhydride ring is positioned on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C7 bridge. This geometry forces the **H_anhydride** protons into the *endo* position of the bicyclic system, where they are tucked underneath the C=C double bond. This brings them into close spatial proximity with the **Me_alkene** groups. A strong NOESY cross-peak between H_anhydride and Me_alkene is expected.\n*   **In the minor (*endo*) product:** The anhydride ring is on the same side (*syn*) as the C7 bridge. The H_anhydride protons are in the *exo* position, far from the Me_alkene groups. Instead, they would be close to the H_bridge protons.\n\n### **5. Conclusion**\n\nThe NOESY cross-peak that is present in the major product (*exo*) but absent in the minor product (*endo*) must be the one connecting the anhydride protons and the alkene methyl protons.\n*   **Interacting Protons:** H_anhydride and Me_alkene.\n*   **Corresponding Signals:** The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n\nThis combination directly matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the provided answers and identifying the most careful points of reasoning.\n\n### **1. Identification of Reactants and Reaction**\n\n*   **Dienophile:** The starting material is a *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid that is dehydrated to an anhydride. The spectroscopic data for this anhydride (¹H NMR: a single peak at 7 ppm; ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) is a classic fingerprint for the highly symmetric molecule **maleic anhydride**. The peaks correspond to the equivalent vinylic protons, vinylic carbons, and carbonyl carbons, respectively.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction between a diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. This reaction forms a bicyclic adduct. The molecular formula of the product, C13H16O3, is consistent with the addition of maleic anhydride (C4H2O3) and the diene (C9H14).\n\n### **2. Assignment of the ¹H NMR Signals**\n\nBased on the product's structure (a tetramethyl-substituted bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene anhydride) and standard chemical shift principles, the signals provided in the options can be confidently assigned:\n\n*   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** These are the two equivalent protons on the anhydride ring. They are adjacent to two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups, which deshields them significantly. Let's label them **H_anhydride**.\n*   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups attached to the C=C double bond. Let's label them **Me_alkene**.\n*   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups at the saturated bridgehead positions. Let's label them **Me_bridgehead**.\n*   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This signal belongs to one of the two non-equivalent protons on the CH₂ bridge (the C7 position). It is a doublet due to geminal coupling with the other proton on the same carbon. Let's label it **H_bridge**.\n\n### **3. Determination of the Major Product (The Most Critical Step)**\n\nThis is the crucial point of the analysis, as it determines which stereoisomer's NOESY spectrum we must consider. The Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomers: *endo* and *exo*.\n\n*   **The Alder-Endo Rule:** This rule predicts that the *endo* adduct is typically the major, kinetically favored product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions in the transition state. Several candidate answers rely solely on this rule.\n*   **The Steric Hindrance Exception:** A careful point, noted by the more accurate candidate answers, is that this rule can be overridden by **severe steric hindrance**. The diene in this problem, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is exceptionally bulky. For the *endo* product to form, the maleic anhydride must approach from the same face as the methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions, leading to a significant steric clash. The *exo* approach, from the opposite, more open face, is sterically much more favorable and proceeds through a lower-energy transition state.\n*   **Conclusion on Stereoselectivity:** Due to this overwhelming steric effect, the **major product is the *exo* adduct**, and the minor product is the *endo* adduct.\n\n### **4. Analysis of the 3D Structure and NOESY Data**\n\nA 2D NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). The question asks for a cross-peak that is **present in the major product** but absent or weak in the minor product. Based on our determination in Step 3, we must analyze the structure of the **major (*exo*) adduct**.\n\n*   **Major Product (*exo* isomer):** In the *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is positioned on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C7 bridge. This geometry forces the **H_anhydride** protons into the *endo* position of the bicyclic system, where they are tucked underneath the C=C double bond. This brings them into close spatial proximity with the **Me_alkene** groups. A strong NOESY cross-peak between **H_anhydride** and **Me_alkene** is expected.\n*   **Minor Product (*endo* isomer):** In the *endo* adduct, the anhydride ring is on the same side (*syn*) as the C7 bridge. The **H_anhydride** protons are in the *exo* position, far from the **Me_alkene** groups. Instead, they would be close to the **H_bridge** protons.\n\n### **5. Final Decision**\n\nThe NOESY cross-peak that is unique to the major product must arise from the spatial proximity found only in the *exo* isomer. This is the interaction between the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl protons.\n\n*   **Interacting Protons:** **H_anhydride** and **Me_alkene**.\n*   **Corresponding Signals:** The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n\nThis combination matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided answers and identifying the most critical points for a correct conclusion.\n\n### **Step 1: Identification of the Reactants and Reaction**\n\n*   **Dienophile:** The starting material is a *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid that is dehydrated to an anhydride. The spectroscopic data for this anhydride—a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm—is a definitive fingerprint for **maleic anhydride**. The symmetry of the molecule explains the single proton signal (for the two equivalent vinylic protons) and the two carbon signals (one for the two equivalent vinylic carbons and one for the two equivalent carbonyl carbons).\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. This reaction forms a bicyclic adduct.\n\n### **Step 2: Assignment of the ¹H NMR Signals**\n\nBased on the structure of the resulting bicyclic product and standard chemical shift principles, the signals provided in the options can be confidently assigned:\n\n*   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** These are the two equivalent protons on the anhydride ring. Their proximity to two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups causes a significant downfield shift. Let's label them **H_anhydride**.\n*   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups attached to the C=C double bond of the product. Let's label them **Me_alkene**.\n*   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This signal belongs to one of the two non-equivalent protons on the CH₂ bridge (the C7 position). It appears as a doublet due to geminal coupling with the other proton on the same carbon. Let's label it **H_bridge**.\n*   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups at the saturated bridgehead positions. They are in a shielded, aliphatic environment. Let's label them **Me_bridgehead**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determination of the Major Product (The Most Critical Point)**\n\nThis is the most crucial step and the primary source of divergence among the candidate answers. The stereochemical outcome of a Diels-Alder reaction can produce two isomers: *endo* and *exo*.\n\n*   **The Alder-Endo Rule:** This rule states that the *endo* adduct is typically the major, kinetically favored product. This preference is due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions between the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile and the developing pi system of the diene in the transition state.\n*   **The Role of Steric Hindrance:** The endo rule is a general guideline that can be overridden by significant steric hindrance. The diene in this problem, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is exceptionally bulky. For the *endo* product to form, the maleic anhydride must approach from the same face as the methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions. This approach creates a severe steric clash.\n*   **Conclusion on Selectivity:** The *exo* approach, from the opposite, more open face of the diene, avoids this steric clash and therefore proceeds through a lower-energy transition state. In cases of such high steric hindrance, sterics dominate over secondary orbital effects. Therefore, the **major product is the *exo* adduct**, and the minor product is the *endo* adduct.\n\n### **Step 4: Analysis of the 3D Structure and NOESY Data**\n\nA 2D NOESY spectrum reveals protons that are close to each other in three-dimensional space (typically < 5 Å). The question asks for a cross-peak that is **present in the major product** but absent or weak in the minor product. Based on our conclusion in Step 3, we must analyze the structure of the **major (*exo*) adduct**.\n\n*   **Major Product (*exo* isomer):** In the *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is positioned on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C7 bridge. This geometry forces the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) into the *endo* position of the bicyclic system. In this position, they are tucked underneath the C=C double bond, bringing them into close spatial proximity with the **Me_alkene** groups (~1.7 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak between these two sets of protons is expected.\n*   **Minor Product (*endo* isomer):** In the *endo* adduct, the anhydride ring is on the same side (*syn*) as the C7 bridge. Here, the **H_anhydride** protons are in the *exo* position, far from the **Me_alkene** groups. Instead, they would be close to the **H_bridge** protons (~1.5 ppm).\n\n### **Step 5: Final Decision**\n\nThe NOESY cross-peak that is characteristic of the major product (*exo*) and absent in the minor product (*endo*) must be the one connecting the anhydride protons and the alkene methyl protons.\n\n*   **Interacting Protons:** **H_anhydride** and **Me_alkene**.\n*   **Corresponding Signals:** The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n\nThis combination of signals directly matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on a careful evaluation of the chemical principles involved.\n\n### **1. Identification of Reactants and Reaction**\n\n*   **Dienophile:** The starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene, which upon dehydration yields an anhydride. The spectroscopic data for this anhydride—a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm (for two equivalent vinylic protons) and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm (vinylic carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons)—is a definitive fingerprint for **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction between a diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**, which forms a bicyclic adduct.\n\n### **2. Assignment of the ¹H NMR Signals**\n\nBefore analyzing the stereochemistry, we must assign the proton signals described in the options to the functional groups in the product's structure. This is based on standard chemical shift principles.\n\n*   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** These are the protons on the anhydride ring, which are highly deshielded by the two adjacent electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups. Let's label them **H_anhydride**.\n*   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the methyl groups attached to the double bond of the final product. Let's label them **Me_alkene**.\n*   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This is one of the two non-equivalent protons on the C7 methylene bridge. It is a doublet due to geminal coupling with the other proton on the same carbon.

The Critical Step: Determination of the Major Product**\n\nThe central point of this problem is determining the stereochemical outcome of the Diels-Alder reaction. Two products can form: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n\n*   **The Alder-Endo Rule:** This rule predicts that the *endo* adduct is typically the major product because it is formed faster (it is the kinetic product). This is due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions in the transition state.\n*   **Steric Hindrance as an Overriding Factor:** The Alder-endo rule is a general guideline that can be overridden by other factors, most notably severe steric hindrance. The diene in this reaction, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is exceptionally bulky. For the *endo* product to form, the maleic anhydride must approach from the same face as the methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions, leading to a significant and unfavorable steric clash.\n*   **Conclusion on Stereoselectivity:** The *exo* approach, from the more open face of the diene, avoids this steric clash and therefore proceeds through a lower-energy transition state. In cases of such high steric hindrance, the **major product is the *exo* adduct**, and the minor product is the *endo* adduct.\n\n### **4.

The spectroscopic data—a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm (equivalent vinylic protons) and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm (vinylic carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons)—is a classic fingerprint for the highly symmetric molecule **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**, which forms a bicyclic adduct.\n\nThis initial analysis is straightforward and agreed upon by all candidate answers.\n\n### **Step 2: Assign the ¹H NMR Signals**\n\nBased on the product's structure (a tetramethyl-substituted bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene anhydride) and the options provided, we can confidently assign the signals based on standard chemical shift principles:\n\n*   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** These are the two equivalent protons on the anhydride ring. They are on carbons adjacent to two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups, which deshields them significantly. Let's label them **H_anhydride**.\n*   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** These are the six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups attached to the C=C double bond (vinylic methyls). Let's label them **Me_alkene**.\n*   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This signal belongs to one of the two non-equivalent protons on the CH₂ bridge (the C7 position). It is a doublet due to geminal coupling with the other proton on the same carbon. Let's label it **H_bridge**.\n*   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** These are the six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups at the saturated bridgehead positions. They are in a more shielded, aliphatic environment. Let's label them **Me_bridgehead**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Major Product (The Critical Point)**\n\nThis is the most important step and the primary source of disagreement among the candidate answers. The Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomers: *endo* and *exo*.\n\n*   **The Alder-Endo Rule:** This rule predicts that the *endo* adduct is typically the major, kinetically favored product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions in the transition state.\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** This rule can be overridden by severe steric hindrance. The diene in this reaction, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is exceptionally bulky. For the *endo* product to form, the maleic anhydride must approach from the same face as the methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions, leading to a significant steric clash. The *exo* approach, from the opposite, more open face, is sterically much more favorable.\n*   **Conclusion:** In cases of such high steric hindrance, the *exo* pathway has a lower energy transition state and becomes the kinetically favored pathway. Therefore, for this specific reaction, the **major product is the *exo* adduct**, and the minor product is the *endo* adduct.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the 3D Structure and NOESY Spectrum**\n\nThe question asks for a NOESY cross-peak that is **present in the major product** but absent in the minor one. Based on our determination in Step 3, we must analyze the structure of the **major (*exo*) product**.\n\n*   **Major Product (*exo* isomer):** In the *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is positioned on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C7 bridge. This geometry forces the anhydride protons (**H_anhydride**) into the *endo* position of the bicyclic system, where they are tucked underneath the C=C double bond. This brings them into close spatial proximity with the vinylic methyl groups (**Me_alkene**). A strong NOESY cross-peak between **H_anhydride** and **Me_alkene** is expected.\n*   **Minor Product (*endo* isomer):** In the minor (*endo*) product, the anhydride ring would be on the same side (*syn*) as the C7 bridge. The **H_anhydride** protons would be in the *exo* position, far from the **Me_alkene** groups. Instead, they would be close to the **H_bridge** protons.\n\n### **Step 5: Final Decision**\n\nThe NOESY cross-peak that is unique to the major product must arise from the spatial proximity found only in the *exo* isomer. This is the interaction between the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl protons.\n\n*   **Interacting Protons:** **H_anhydride** and **Me_alkene**.\n*   **Corresponding Signals:** The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n\nThis combination of signals directly matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided answers and identifying the most chemically accurate conclusion.\n\n### **Step 1: Identification of Reactants and Reaction**\n\n*   **Dienophile:** The starting material is a *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid that is dehydrated to an anhydride. The spectroscopic data for this anhydride (¹H NMR: a single peak at 7 ppm; ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) is a classic fingerprint for the highly symmetric molecule **maleic anhydride**. The peaks correspond to the equivalent vinylic protons, vinylic carbons, and carbonyl carbons, respectively.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction between a diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**, which forms a bicyclic adduct.\n\n### **Step 2: Assignment of the ¹H NMR Signals**\n\nBased on the product's bicyclic structure and standard chemical shift principles, the signals provided in the options can be confidently assigned. This assignment is consistent across almost all candidate answers.\n\n*   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** These are the two equivalent protons on the anhydride ring. They are adjacent to two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups, which deshields them significantly. Let's label them **H_anhydride**.\n*   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups attached to the C=C double bond of the final product. Let's label them **Me_alkene**.\n*   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups at the saturated bridgehead positions. Let's label them **Me_bridgehead**.\n*   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This signal belongs to one of the two non-equivalent protons on the CH₂ bridge (the C7 position). It appears as a doublet due to geminal coupling with the other proton on the same carbon. Let's label it **H_bridge**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determination of the Major Product (The Critical Point of Analysis)**\n\nThis is the most crucial step and the primary source of disagreement among the candidate answers. The stereochemical outcome of the Diels-Alder reaction must be determined.\n\n*   **The Alder-Endo Rule:** This is a general rule of thumb stating that the *endo* adduct is typically the major, kinetically favored product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions in the transition state. Several candidate answers rely solely on this rule.\n*   **The Role of Steric Hindrance:** The endo rule can be overridden by severe steric hindrance. The diene in this problem, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is exceptionally bulky. For the *endo* product to form, the maleic anhydride must approach from the same face as the methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions. This approach creates a significant steric clash, raising the energy of the *endo* transition state.\n*   **Conclusion on Selectivity:** The *exo* approach, from the more open face of the diene, avoids this steric clash and therefore proceeds through a lower-energy transition state. In cases of such high steric hindrance, sterics dominate over secondary orbital effects. Therefore, the **major product is the *exo* adduct**, and the minor product is the *endo* adduct. The most accurate candidate answers (e.g., 1, 3, 5, 9, 13, 14) correctly identify this exception.\n\n### **Step 4: Analysis of 3D Structures and NOESY Data**\n\nA 2D NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). The question asks for a cross-peak that is **present in the major product** but absent (or very weak) in the minor product. Based on our conclusion from Step 3, we must analyze the structure of the **major (*exo*) adduct**.\n\n*   **Major Product (*exo* isomer):** In the *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is positioned on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C7 bridge. This geometry forces the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) into the *endo* position of the bicyclic system, where they are tucked underneath the C=C double bond. This brings them into close spatial proximity with the **Me_alkene** groups (~1.7 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak between them is expected.\n*   **Minor Product (*endo* isomer):** In the *endo* adduct, the anhydride ring is on the same side (*syn*) as the C7 bridge. The **H_anhydride** protons are in the *exo* position, far from the **Me_alkene** groups. Instead, they are close to the **H_bridge** protons (~1.5 ppm).\n\n### **Step 5: Final Decision**\n\nThe NOESY cross-peak that is unique to the major product must arise from the spatial proximity found only in the *exo* isomer. This is the interaction between the anhydride protons and the alkene methyl protons.\n\n*   **Interacting Protons:** **H_anhydride** and **Me_alkene**.\n*   **Corresponding Signals:** The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n\nThis combination of signals directly matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis problem requires a careful, step-by-step analysis of a Diels-Alder reaction, with a critical focus on stereochemistry and its manifestation in a 2D NOESY NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction**\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes an anhydride formed from a *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid.

Let's label them **H_anhydride**.\n*   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups attached to the C=C double bond. Let's label them **Me_alkene**.\n*   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This is one of the two non-equivalent protons on the CH₂ bridge (the C7 position). It is a doublet due to geminal coupling with the other proton on the same carbon. Let's label it **H_bridge**.\n*   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups at the saturated bridgehead positions. Let's label them **Me_bridgehead**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Major Product (The Critical Step)**\nThis is the most important point of analysis. The Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n*   The **Alder-endo rule** generally predicts that the *endo* adduct is the major, kinetically favored product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions.\n*   However, this rule can be **overridden by severe steric hindrance**. The diene in this problem, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is extremely bulky. For the *endo* product to form, the maleic anhydride must approach from the same face as the methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions, leading to a significant steric clash.\n*   The *exo* approach, from the opposite and more open face, is sterically much more favorable. In cases of such high steric hindrance, sterics dominate the reaction pathway.

The spectroscopic data—a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm (vinylic protons) and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm (vinylic carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons)—is a classic fingerprint for the highly symmetric molecule **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**, which forms a bicyclic adduct.\n\nThis initial analysis is consistent and correct across all candidate answers.\n\n### **Step 2: Assignment of the ¹H NMR Signals**\nBased on the product's structure and standard chemical shift principles, the signals provided in the options can be confidently assigned:\n*   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** These are the two equivalent protons on the anhydride ring, deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl groups. Let's call them **H_anhydride**.\n*   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups attached to the C=C double bond. Let's call them **Me_alkene**.\n*   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This is one of the two non-equivalent protons on the CH₂ bridge (the C7 position). Let's call it **H_bridge**.\n*   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups at the saturated bridgehead positions.\n\nThis assignment is also consistent and correct across all candidate answers.\n\n### **Step 3: Determination of the Major Product (The Critical Step)**\nThis is the most important point of analysis and where the candidate answers diverge. The reaction can form two stereoisomers: *endo* and *exo*.\n*   **The Alder-endo Rule:** This rule predicts that the *endo* adduct is typically the major, kinetically favored product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions in the transition state. Several agents follow this rule.\n*   **Steric Hindrance as an Overriding Factor:** This general rule can be overridden by severe steric hindrance. The diene in this problem, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is extremely bulky. For the *endo* product to form, the maleic anhydride must approach from the same face as the two methyl groups that become the bridgehead methyls. This leads to a significant steric clash. The *exo* approach, from the opposite, more open face, is sterically much more favorable and proceeds through a lower-energy transition state.\n*   **Conclusion on Stereochemistry:** In cases of such high steric hindrance, the steric effect dominates. Therefore, the **major product is the *exo* adduct**, and the minor product is the *endo* adduct. The majority of the provided answers correctly identify this crucial exception.\n\n### **Step 4: Analysis of the 3D Structure and NOESY Data**\nA 2D NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å). The question asks for a cross-peak that is **present in the major product** but absent in the minor one. Based on our conclusion from Step 3, we must analyze the structure of the **major (*exo*) product**.\n\n*   **Major Product (*exo* isomer):** In the *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is positioned on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C7 bridge. This geometry forces the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) into the *endo* position of the bicyclic system, where they are tucked underneath the C=C double bond. This brings them into close spatial proximity with the **Me_alkene** groups (~1.7 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak between them is expected.\n*   **Minor Product (*endo* isomer):** In the *endo* adduct, the anhydride ring is on the same side (*syn*) as the C7 bridge. The **H_anhydride** protons are in the *exo* position, far from the **Me_alkene** groups. Instead, they are close to the **H_bridge** protons (~1.5 ppm).\n\n### **Step 5: Final Answer**\nThe NOESY cross-peak that is unique to the major product must arise from the spatial proximity found only in the *exo* isomer. This is the interaction between the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl protons.\n\n*   **Interacting Protons:** H_anhydride and Me_alkene.\n*   **Corresponding Signals:** The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n\nThis combination of signals directly matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Identify the Reactants and the Reaction**\n\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes an anhydride formed from a *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid. The spectroscopic data—a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm (for two equivalent vinylic protons) and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm (vinylic carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons)—is a classic fingerprint for the highly symmetric molecule **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction between a diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**, which forms a bicyclic adduct. The molecular formula of the product, C13H16O3, is consistent with the addition of maleic anhydride (C4H2O3) and the diene (C9H14).\n\n### **Step 2: Assign the ¹H NMR Signals**\n\nBased on the product's structure (a tetramethyl-substituted bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene anhydride) and the options provided, we can assign the signals based on standard chemical shift principles:\n\n*   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** These are the two equivalent protons on the anhydride ring. They are on carbons adjacent to two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups, which deshields them significantly. Let's call them **H_anhydride**.\n*   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups attached to the C=C double bond (vinylic methyls). Let's call them **Me_alkene**.\n*   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This is one of the two non-equivalent protons on the CH₂ bridge (the C7 position). It is a doublet due to geminal coupling with the other proton on the same carbon. Let's call it **H_bridge**.\n*   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups at the saturated bridgehead positions. They are in a more shielded, aliphatic environment. Let's call them **Me_bridgehead**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Major Product (The Critical Point of Stereochemistry)**\n\nThis is the most important point of analysis. The Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n\n*   **The Alder-endo Rule:** This rule states that the *endo* adduct is typically the major, kinetically favored product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions in the transition state.\n*   **Steric Hindrance as an Overriding Factor:** The Alder-endo rule can be overridden by severe steric hindrance. The diene in this problem, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is exceptionally bulky. For the *endo* product to form, the maleic anhydride must approach from the same face as the two methyl groups that will become the bridgehead methyls (at C1 and C4). This approach leads to a significant steric clash.\n*   **Conclusion:** The *exo* approach, from the opposite and more open face, is sterically much more favorable and proceeds through a lower-energy transition state. In cases of such highly substituted dienes, sterics dominate, and the **major product is the *exo* adduct**. The minor product is the *endo* adduct.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the 3D Structures and NOESY Data**\n\nA 2D NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). The question asks for a cross-peak that is **present in the major product** but absent (or weak) in the minor one. Based on our conclusion from Step 3, we must analyze the structure of the **major (*exo*) adduct**.\n\n*   **Major Product (*exo* isomer):** In the *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is positioned *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C7 bridge.

Instead, they are close to the **H_bridge** protons (~1.5 ppm).\n\n### **Step 5: Final Decision**\n\nThe NOESY cross-peak that is present in the major product (*exo*) but absent in the minor product (*endo*) must be the one connecting the anhydride protons and the alkene methyl protons.\n\n*   **Interacting Protons:** H_anhydride and Me_alkene.\n*   **Corresponding Signals:** The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n\nThis combination matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### **1.

The spectroscopic data for this anhydride (¹H NMR: a single peak at 7 ppm; ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) is a classic fingerprint for the highly symmetric molecule **maleic anhydride**.

Based on our determination in Step 3, we must analyze the structure of the **major (*exo*) adduct**.\n\n*   **Major Product (*exo* isomer):** In the *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is positioned on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C7 bridge. This geometry forces the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) into the *endo* position of the bicyclic system, where they are tucked underneath the C=C double bond. This brings them into close spatial proximity with the **Me_alkene** groups (~1.7 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak between them is expected.\n*   **Minor Product (*endo* isomer):** In the *endo* adduct, the anhydride ring is on the same side (*syn*) as the C7 bridge. The **H_anhydride** protons are in the *exo* position, far from the **Me_alkene** groups. Instead, they would be close to the **H_bridge** protons (~1.5 ppm).\n\n### **5.

Identification of Reactants and Reaction**\n\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes an anhydride formed from a *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid. The spectroscopic data—a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm (vinylic protons) and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm (vinylic carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons)—is a classic fingerprint for the highly symmetric molecule **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction between a diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**, which forms a bicyclic adduct.\n\n### **2. Assignment of the ¹H NMR Signals**\n\nBased on the product's structure (a tetramethyl-substituted bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene anhydride) and the options provided, we can confidently assign the chemical shifts:\n*   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** These are the two equivalent protons on the anhydride ring. They are on carbons adjacent to two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups, which deshields them significantly. Let's call them **H_anhydride**.\n*   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups attached to the C=C double bond (vinylic methyls). Let's call them **Me_alkene**.\n*   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This is one of the two non-equivalent protons on the CH₂ bridge (the C7 position). It is a doublet due to geminal coupling with the other proton on the same carbon. Let's call it **H_bridge**.\n*   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups at the saturated bridgehead positions. Let's call them **Me_bridgehead**.\n\n### **3. Determination of the Major Product (The Critical Step)**\n\nThis is the most important point of analysis. The Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomers: *endo* and *exo*.\n*   **The Alder-endo Rule:** This rule states that the *endo* adduct is typically the major, kinetically favored product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions.\n*   **Steric Hindrance as an Overriding Factor:** The Alder-endo rule can be overridden by severe steric hindrance. The diene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is extremely bulky, particularly at the C1 and C4 positions which are involved in bond formation. For the *endo* product to form, the maleic anhydride must approach from \"underneath\" the diene, leading to a significant steric clash with the methyl groups. The *exo* approach, from the more open face, is sterically much more favorable and proceeds through a lower-energy transition state.\n*   **Conclusion:** Due to overwhelming steric hindrance, the **major product is the *exo* adduct**, and the minor product is the *endo* adduct.\n\n### **4.

This geometry forces the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) into the *endo* position of the bicyclic system, where they are tucked underneath the C=C double bond. This brings them into close spatial proximity with the **Me_alkene** groups (~1.7 ppm).

Identification of Reactants and Reaction**\n\n*   **Dienophile:** The starting material is a *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid that is dehydrated to an anhydride. The spectroscopic data for this anhydride (¹H NMR: a single peak at 7 ppm; ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) is a classic fingerprint for the highly symmetric molecule **maleic anhydride**.

It is a doublet due to geminal coupling with the other proton on the same carbon. Let's label it **H_bridge**.\n\n### **3. Determination of the Major Product (The Most Critical Step)**\n\nThis is the crucial point of the analysis, as it determines which stereoisomer's NOESY spectrum we must consider. The Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomers: *endo* and *exo*.\n\n*   **The Alder-Endo Rule:** This rule predicts that the *endo* adduct is typically the major, kinetically favored product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions in the transition state. Several candidate answers rely solely on this rule.\n*   **The Steric Hindrance Exception:** A careful point, noted by the more accurate candidate answers, is that this rule can be overridden by **severe steric hindrance**. The diene in this problem, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is exceptionally bulky. For the *endo* product to form, the maleic anhydride must approach from the same face as the methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions, leading to a significant steric clash.

Based on our determination in Step 3, we must analyze the structure of the **major (*exo*) adduct**.\n\n*   **Major Product (*exo* isomer):** In the *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is positioned on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C7 bridge. This geometry forces the **H_anhydride** protons into the *endo* position of the bicyclic system, where they are tucked underneath the C=C double bond.

Final Decision**\n\nThe NOESY cross-peak that is unique to the major product must arise from the spatial proximity found only in the *exo* isomer. This is the interaction between the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl protons.\n\n*   **Interacting Protons:** **H_anhydride** and **Me_alkene**.\n*   **Corresponding Signals:** The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n\nThis combination matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided answers and identifying the most critical points for a correct conclusion.\n\n### **Step 1: Identification of the Reactants and Reaction**\n\n*   **Dienophile:** The starting material is a *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid that is dehydrated to an anhydride. The spectroscopic data for this anhydride—a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm—is a definitive fingerprint for **maleic anhydride**. The symmetry of the molecule explains the single proton signal (for the two equivalent vinylic protons) and the two carbon signals (one for the two equivalent vinylic carbons and one for the two equivalent carbonyl carbons).\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. This reaction forms a bicyclic adduct.\n\n### **Step 2: Assignment of the ¹H NMR Signals**\n\nBased on the structure of the resulting bicyclic product and standard chemical shift principles, the signals provided in the options can be confidently assigned:\n\n*   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** These are the two equivalent protons on the anhydride ring. Their proximity to two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups causes a significant downfield shift. Let's label them **H_anhydride**.\n*   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups attached to the C=C double bond of the product. Let's label them **Me_alkene**.\n*   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This signal belongs to one of the two non-equivalent protons on the CH₂ bridge (the C7 position). It appears as a doublet due to geminal coupling with the other proton on the same carbon. Let's label it **H_bridge**.\n*   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups at the saturated bridgehead positions. They are in a shielded, aliphatic environment. Let's label them **Me_bridgehead**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determination of the Major Product (The Most Critical Point)**\n\nThis is the most crucial step and the primary source of divergence among the candidate answers. The stereochemical outcome of a Diels-Alder reaction can produce two isomers: *endo* and *exo*.\n\n*   **The Alder-Endo Rule:** This rule states that the *endo* adduct is typically the major, kinetically favored product. This preference is due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions between the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile and the developing pi system of the diene in the transition state.\n*   **The Role of Steric Hindrance:** The endo rule is a general guideline that can be overridden by significant steric hindrance. The diene in this problem, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is exceptionally bulky. For the *endo* product to form, the maleic anhydride must approach from the same face as the methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions. This approach creates a severe steric clash.\n*   **Conclusion on Selectivity:** The *exo* approach, from the opposite, more open face of the diene, avoids this steric clash and therefore proceeds through a lower-energy transition state. In cases of such high steric hindrance, sterics dominate over secondary orbital effects. Therefore, the **major product is the *exo* adduct**, and the minor product is the *endo* adduct.\n\n### **Step 4: Analysis of the 3D Structure and NOESY Data**\n\nA 2D NOESY spectrum reveals protons that are close to each other in three-dimensional space (typically < 5 Å). The question asks for a cross-peak that is **present in the major product** but absent or weak in the minor product. Based on our conclusion in Step 3, we must analyze the structure of the **major (*exo*) adduct**.\n\n*   **Major Product (*exo* isomer):** In the *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is positioned on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C7 bridge. This geometry forces the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) into the *endo* position of the bicyclic system. In this position, they are tucked underneath the C=C double bond, bringing them into close spatial proximity with the **Me_alkene** groups (~1.7 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak between these two sets of protons is expected.\n*   **Minor Product (*endo* isomer):** In the *endo* adduct, the anhydride ring is on the same side (*syn*) as the C7 bridge. Here, the **H_anhydride** protons are in the *exo* position, far from the **Me_alkene** groups. Instead, they would be close to the **H_bridge** protons (~1.5 ppm).\n\n### **Step 5: Final Decision**\n\nThe NOESY cross-peak that is characteristic of the major product (*exo*) and absent in the minor product (*endo*) must be the one connecting the anhydride protons and the alkene methyl protons.\n\n*   **Interacting Protons:** **H_anhydride** and **Me_alkene**.\n*   **Corresponding Signals:** The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n\nThis combination of signals directly matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on a careful evaluation of the chemical principles involved.\n\n### **1. Identification of Reactants and Reaction**\n\n*   **Dienophile:** The starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene, which upon dehydration yields an anhydride. The spectroscopic data for this anhydride—a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm (for two equivalent vinylic protons) and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm (vinylic carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons)—is a definitive fingerprint for **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction between a diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**, which forms a bicyclic adduct.\n\n### **2. Assignment of the ¹H NMR Signals**\n\nBefore analyzing the stereochemistry, we must assign the proton signals described in the options to the functional groups in the product's structure. This is based on standard chemical shift principles.\n\n*   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** These are the protons on the anhydride ring, which are highly deshielded by the two adjacent electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups. Let's label them **H_anhydride**.\n*   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the methyl groups attached to the double bond of the final product. Let's label them **Me_alkene**.\n*   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This is one of the two non-equivalent protons on the C7 methylene bridge. It is a doublet due to geminal coupling with the other proton on the same carbon.

The Critical Step: Determination of the Major Product**\n\nThe central point of this problem is determining the stereochemical outcome of the Diels-Alder reaction. Two products can form: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n\n*   **The Alder-Endo Rule:** This rule predicts that the *endo* adduct is typically the major product because it is formed faster (it is the kinetic product). This is due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions in the transition state.\n*   **Steric Hindrance as an Overriding Factor:** The Alder-endo rule is a general guideline that can be overridden by other factors, most notably severe steric hindrance. The diene in this reaction, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is exceptionally bulky. For the *endo* product to form, the maleic anhydride must approach from the same face as the methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions, leading to a significant and unfavorable steric clash.\n*   **Conclusion on Stereoselectivity:** The *exo* approach, from the more open face of the diene, avoids this steric clash and therefore proceeds through a lower-energy transition state. In cases of such high steric hindrance, the **major product is the *exo* adduct**, and the minor product is the *endo* adduct.\n\n### **4.
