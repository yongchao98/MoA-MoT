For a planet of similar mass, a faster stellar wobble is caused by a stronger gravitational pull from a closer orbit. According to Kepler's Third Law, a closer orbit has a *shorter* orbital period. Therefore, we must expect `P₂` to be shorter than `P₁`, and the ratio `P₂ / P₁` must be less than 1. This check immediately eliminates options A (~ 1.40) and B (~ 1.96).\n*   **Correct Proportionality and Exponents:** The entire solution hinges on correctly identifying the relationship `K ∝ P^(-1/3)` and then correctly manipulating the exponents to get `P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)^3`.

The derivation correctly yields `(K₁ / K₂)^3`. Accidentally inverting the ratio to `(K₂ / K₁)^3` would calculate `P₁ / P₂` and give an incorrect answer greater than 1.\n*   **Implicit Assumptions:** The solution relies on the standard assumption that when planet masses are described as \"similar\" in an RV problem, it refers to the measured minimum mass, `m_p * sin(i)`, being similar for both systems.

The only discrepancy among the answers lies in matching the final number to the correct lettered option, which is a result of inconsistent option lists being used by the different agents.\n\nHere is a definitive step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the options provided in your prompt.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift (Δλ) to Radial Velocity Amplitude (K):**\n    The core principle of the Radial Velocity (RV) method is that the observed maximum periodic shift in a star's spectral line wavelength, Δλ, is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, K.\n    *   **Relationship:** `K ∝ Δλ`\n    *   **Given Data:** For planet #1, `Δλ₁ = 5` miliangstrom. For planet #2, `Δλ₂ = 7` miliangstrom.\n    *   **Ratio of Amplitudes:** The ratio of the stars' velocity amplitudes is therefore equal to the ratio of the observed wavelength shifts: `K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 / 7`.\n\n2.  **Relate Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P):**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula (assuming the planet's mass `m_p` is much less than the star's mass `M_star`):\n    `K ≈ (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / M_star^(2/3)`\n    where `P` is the orbital period, `i` is the orbital inclination, and `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\n3.  **Simplify the Relationship Using the Problem's Conditions:**\n    The problem states that several key parameters are the same for both systems, which allows for a direct comparison:\n    *   The stars have identical masses (`M_star₁ = M_star₂`).\n    *   The planets have similar masses (`m_p₁ ≈ m_p₂`).\n    *   A standard and necessary assumption for this type of problem is that the orbital inclinations are comparable (`sin(i₁) ≈ sin(i₂)`), as the RV method's observable is the minimum mass, `m_p * sin(i)`.\n\n    With all other terms being constant for both systems, the formula simplifies to a core proportionality between K and P:\n    *   **Simplified Proportionality:** `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`\n\n4.  **Solve for the Ratio of the Orbital Periods:**\n    Using the proportionality from the previous step, we can set up a ratio for the two systems:\n    `K₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3)`\n    Using the exponent rule `a⁻ⁿ / b⁻ⁿ = (b/a)ⁿ`, this simplifies to:\n    `K₁ / K₂ = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`\n\n    The question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1 (`P₂ / P₁`). To find this, we must cube both sides of the equation:\n    `P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)^3`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Numerical Value:**\n    Substitute the ratio of the velocity amplitudes from Step 1 into the equation:\n    `P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³`\n    `P₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343`\n    `P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Physical Sanity Check:** Planet #2 causes a larger wavelength shift (7 mÅ > 5 mÅ), which implies its host star is moving faster (`K₂ > K₁`). For a planet of similar mass, a faster stellar wobble is caused by a stronger gravitational pull from a closer orbit. A closer orbit has a shorter orbital period (Kepler's Third Law). Therefore, we must expect `P₂` to be shorter than `P₁`, and the ratio `P₂ / P₁` must be less than 1. This check immediately eliminates options B (~1.40) and C (~1.96).\n*   **Correct Proportionality:** The entire solution hinges on correctly identifying the relationship `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`. All candidate answers correctly identified this, showing a strong consensus on the underlying physics.\n*   **Correct Algebraic Manipulation:** It is crucial to correctly manipulate the exponents. The final relationship for the desired ratio is `P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)³`. A common mistake would be to invert the ratio to `(K₂ / K₁)^3` (which would calculate `P₁ / P₂`) or to use the wrong exponent, such as 1/3 instead of 3.\n*   **Implicit Assumptions:** The solution relies on the standard assumption that when planet masses are described as \"similar\" in an RV problem, it refers to the measured minimum mass, `m_p * sin(i)`, being similar for both systems. This is necessary to arrive at a single numerical answer.\n*   **Matching Calculation to Options:** The calculated value is approximately 0.3644. This must be matched to the specific options provided in the question:\n    *   A) ~ 0.36\n    *   B) ~ 1.40\n    *   C) ~ 1.96\n    *   D) ~ 0.85\n\nThe calculated value of `~0.3644` corresponds directly to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",
