The star has a mass of 1.5 times that of the Sun, a radius 1.2 times that of the Sun, and an effective temperature (Teff) of 6300 K. Planet1 has a mass equivalent to 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 times that of Earth, while Planet2 has a mass equivalent to 5 Earth masses and a radius 1.3 times that of Earth. Interestingly, both planets are in circular orbits. Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 Å in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å, while the gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift of up to 0.04 Å. Assuming that both planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2?\n\nA) ~ 1.30\nB) ~ 1.05\nC) ~ 0.98\nD) ~ 0.53\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nThe equilibrium temperature T_eq of a planet is given by the formula:\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\nwhere T_star is the star's temperature, A is the planet's albedo, R_star is the star's radius, and 'a' is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nWe want to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2. Since both planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, the terms T_star, R_star, and (1 - A) will cancel out:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude (K_star) induced by a planet on its star is related to the planet's mass (M_p) and its orbital semi-major axis (a) by:\nK_star ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a) = M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))\nwhere M_star is the mass of the star and G is the gravitational constant.\n\nThe Doppler shift (Δλ) is proportional to the radial velocity (K_star):\nΔλ / λ_0 = K_star / c  => K_star ∝ Δλ\n\nFrom the K_star formula, we can solve for 'a':\nK_star^2 = M_p^2 * G / (M_star * a)\na = (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * K_star^2)\n\nNow we can find the ratio a_2 / a_1:\na_2 / a_1 = [ (G * M_p2^2) / (M_star * K_star2^2) ] / [ (G * M_p1^2) / (M_star * K_star1^2) ]\na_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_star1 / K_star2)^2\n\nSince K_star ∝ Δλ, we have (K_star1 / K_star2) = (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2). Substituting this into the equation for a_2 / a_1:\na_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)^2\n\nNow, substitute this back into the temperature ratio equation:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1) = sqrt( (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)^2 )\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n*   M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n*   M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n*   Δλ_1 = 0.03 Å\n*   Δλ_2 = 0.04 Å\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04) = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4) = 15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThe user wants me to solve the problem and provide the reasoning and the final answer.\n\n**1. Identify the Goal:**\nThe question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, which can be written as `T_eq1 / T_eq2`.\n\n**2. Recall the Formula for Equilibrium Temperature:**\nThe equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) of a planet is given by:\n`T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`\nwhere:\n- `T_star` is the star's effective temperature.\n- `R_star` is the star's radius.\n- `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n- `A` is the planet's Bond albedo.\n\n**3. Set up the Ratio:**\nWe need to find the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2`:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a_1))^(1/2) * (1 - A_1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a_2))^(1/2) * (1 - A_2)^(1/4)]`\n\n**4. Simplify the Ratio:**\nSeveral terms are the same for both planets and will cancel out:\n- The star is the same, so `T_star` and `R_star` are constant.\n- The problem states that both planets have the same albedo (`A_1 = A_2`).\n- The factor of 2 is also a constant.\n\nAfter canceling these terms, the equation simplifies to:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (1 / a_1)^(1/2) / (1 / a_2)^(1/2)`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a_2 / a_1)^(1/2)`\n\nThis means the problem is now reduced to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes of the two planets (`a_2 / a_1`).\n\n**5. Relate Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity Data:**\nThe problem provides information from the radial velocity (RV) method. For a star-planet system with the planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (`K`) is given by:\n`K ≈ (M_p * sin(i)) / (M_star * a)^(1/2) * (G / M_star)^(1/2)`\n`K ≈ M_p * sin(i) * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))`\nwhere:\n- `M_p` is the planet's mass.\n- `M_star` is the star's mass.\n- `i` is the orbital inclination.\n- `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\nSince both planets were detected using the transit method, their orbits must be nearly edge-on to our line of sight. This means the inclination `i` is approximately 90°, and `sin(i) ≈ 1`. The formula simplifies to:\n`K ≈ M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))`\n\n**6. Solve for the Semi-Major Axis Ratio (`a_2 / a_1`):**\nLet's first rearrange the formula to solve for `a`:\n`K^2 = M_p^2 * (G / (M_star * a))`\n`a = (G / M_star) * (M_p^2 / K^2)`\n\nNow we can find the ratio `a_2 / a_1`:\n`a_2 / a_1 = [(G / M_star) * (M_p2^2 / K_2^2)] / [(G / M_star) * (M_p1^2 / K_1^2)]`\n\nThe term `(G / M_star)` cancels out, leaving:\n`a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2^2 / K_2^2) / (M_p1^2 / K_1^2)`\n`a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_1 / K_2)^2`\n\n**7. Determine the Ratios from the Problem Statement:**\n- **Mass Ratio (`M_p2 / M_p1`):**\n  `M_p1 = 7` Earth masses\n  `M_p2 = 5` Earth masses\n  `M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7`\n\n- **RV Semi-Amplitude Ratio (`K_1 / K_2`):**\n  The Doppler shift `Δλ` is directly proportional to the radial velocity `v`, and thus the semi-amplitude `K` is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift.\n  `Δλ_1 = 0.03 Å`\n  `Δλ_2 = 0.04 Å`\n  `K_1 / K_2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4`\n\n**8. Calculate `a_2 / a_1`:**\nSubstitute the ratios into the equation:\n`a_2 / a_1 = (5 / 7)^2 * (3 / 4)^2`\n`a_2 / a_1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)`\n`a_2 / a_1 = 225 / 784`\n\n**9. Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:**\nNow substitute the value of `a_2 / a_1` back into the simplified temperature ratio equation:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a_2 / a_1)^(1/2)`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (225 / 784)^(1/2)`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225) / sqrt(784)`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28`\n\n**10. Compute the Numerical Value:**\n`15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357`\n\nThis value is closest to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, which can be written as $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n    where:\n    *   $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n    *   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n    *   $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** We can set up the ratio for the two planets:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:** The problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same for both. It is also given that the planets have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). These terms cancel out, simplifying the equation significantly:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_2} \\right)^{1/2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n    To find the temperature ratio, we need to find the ratio of their semi-major axes ($a_2/a_1$).\n\n5.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity:** The radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is related to the planet's mass ($M_p$), the star's mass ($M_{star}$), and the semi-major axis ($a$). For a circular orbit and assuming the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass ($M_p \\ll M_{star}$), the formula is:\n    $K = \\left( \\frac{G}{a M_{star}} \\right)^{1/2} M_p \\sin(i)$\n    where $G$ is the gravitational constant and $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n    Since both planets were detected by the transit method, their orbits must be edge-on, meaning their inclination $i$ is approximately 90°, and thus $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$.\n\n6.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis (a):** We can rearrange the formula to solve for $a$:\n    $K^2 = \\frac{G}{a M_{star}} M_p^2 \\sin^2(i)$\n    $a = \\frac{G M_p^2 \\sin^2(i)}{K^2 M_{star}}$\n\n7.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes ($a_2/a_1$):**\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{\\frac{G M_{p,2}^2 \\sin^2(i_2)}{K_2^2 M_{star}}}{\\frac{G M_{p,1}^2 \\sin^2(i_1)}{K_1^2 M_{star}}}$\n    The terms $G$, $M_{star}$, and $\\sin^2(i)$ (since $i_1 \\approx i_2 \\approx 90^\\circ$) cancel out:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p,2}^2}{K_2^2} \\cdot \\frac{K_1^2}{M_{p,1}^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n8.  **Determine the Input Ratios:**\n    *   **Mass Ratio:** $M_{p,1} = 7 \\ M_{Earth}$, $M_{p,2} = 5 \\ M_{Earth}$.\n        $\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n    *   **RV Semi-Amplitude Ratio:** The Doppler shift, $\\Delta\\lambda$, is directly proportional to the radial velocity semi-amplitude, K.\n        $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å, $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å.\n        $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n9.  **Substitute and Calculate:**\n    *   First, calculate the ratio of semi-major axes:\n        $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\cdot \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n    *   Now, calculate the ratio of equilibrium temperatures:\n        $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{225}}{\\sqrt{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n10. **Final Answer:** Convert the fraction to a decimal.\n    $\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{A}$.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe equilibrium temperature of a planet (T_eq) is determined by the energy balance between the stellar radiation it absorbs and the thermal radiation it emits. The formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\nWhere:\n*   T_star is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   R_star is the radius of the star.\n*   'a' is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   'A' is the planet's Bond albedo.\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for Planet1 and Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (R_star / (2*a1))^(1/2) * (1 - A1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2*a2))^(1/2) * (1 - A2)^(1/4)]\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star (T_star and R_star are constant) and have the same albedo (A1 = A2), most terms cancel out:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [(1/a1)^(1/2)] / [(1/a2)^(1/2)] = (a2 / a1)^(1/2) = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\nNow, we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes (a2 / a1) using the radial velocity (RV) data. The RV amplitude (K) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n\nK = (M_p / M_star) * v_orbital = (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\nK = (M_p / sqrt(M_star)) * sqrt(G / a)\n\nRearranging for 'a':\nsqrt(a) = (M_p * sqrt(G)) / (K * sqrt(M_star))\na = (M_p^2 * G) / (K^2 * M_star)\n\nNow, let's find the ratio a2 / a1. The constants G and M_star will cancel out:\na2 / a1 = [M_p2^2 / K2^2] / [M_p1^2 / K1^2]\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2\n\nThe ratio of RV amplitudes (K1 / K2) is directly proportional to the ratio of their observed Doppler shifts (Δλ1 / Δλ2).\n\nGiven:\n*   M_p1 = 7 M_earth, M_p2 = 5 M_earth  =>  M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n*   Δλ1 = 0.03 Å, Δλ2 = 0.04 Å  =>  K1 / K2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\nNow substitute these into the equation for a2 / a1:\na2 / a1 = (5/7)^2 * (3/4)^2\n\nFinally, substitute this back into the temperature ratio equation:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1) = sqrt( (5/7)^2 * (3/4)^2 )\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5/7) * (3/4)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is closest to 0.53.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe calculation shows that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 0.5357.\n\nLet's compare this result with the given options:\nA) ~ 1.05\nB) ~ 0.98\nC) ~ 1.30\nD) ~ 0.53\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.5357 is closest to option D.\n\nFinal verification of the steps:\n- The formula for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1) is correct for planets around the same star with the same albedo.\n- The formula relating the semi-major axis 'a' to the RV semi-amplitude 'K' and planet mass 'M_p' is a = (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * K^2) for circular orbits viewed edge-on (sin(i)=1).\n- The ratio of semi-major axes a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_1 / K_2)^2 is derived correctly.\n- The RV semi-amplitude K is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift Δλ (K = c * Δλ / λ_0), so the ratio K_1 / K_2 is equal to the ratio Δλ_1 / Δλ_2.\n- The values used for the ratios are correct: M_p2 / M_p1 = 5/7 and K_1 / K_2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4.\n- The final calculation T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt((5/7)^2 * (3/4)^2) = sqrt(225/784) = 15/28 ≈ 0.5357 is arithmetically sound.\n\nThe reasoning and calculation are correct. The final answer matches option D.<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nTo find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2), we start with the formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a)) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\nWhere:\n*   `T_star` = Star's effective temperature\n*   `R_star` = Star's radius\n*   `a` = Planet's semi-major axis\n*   `A` = Planet's albedo\n\nWe want to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2. Since both planets orbit the same star (`T_star` and `R_star` are constant) and have the same albedo (`A` is constant), these terms cancel out in the ratio:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\nThis means we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes. We can derive this from the radial velocity (RV) data. For a circular orbit, the star's RV semi-amplitude (K) is given by:\n\nK ∝ M_p / sqrt(a)\nwhere `M_p` is the planet's mass.\n\nFrom this, we can write:\nK1 ∝ M1 / sqrt(a1)\nK2 ∝ M2 / sqrt(a2)\n\nNow, we can solve for `sqrt(a)`:\nsqrt(a) ∝ M_p / K\n\nThen, the ratio `sqrt(a2) / sqrt(a1)` is:\nsqrt(a2) / sqrt(a1) = (M2 / K2) / (M1 / K1) = (M2 / M1) * (K1 / K2)\n\nWe know that T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1) = sqrt(a2) / sqrt(a1). Therefore:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M2 / M1) * (K1 / K2)\n\nThe ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes (K1 / K2) is equal to the ratio of the maximum Doppler shifts (Δλ1 / Δλ2):\nK1 / K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2 = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3 / 4\n\nThe ratio of the masses is:\nM2 / M1 = 5 Earth masses / 7 Earth masses = 5 / 7\n\nNow, we can calculate the temperature ratio:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4) = 15 / 28\n\nConverting this to a decimal:\n15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2), we can follow these steps:\n\n**1. The Formula for Equilibrium Temperature**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n\nWhere:\n*   `T_star` is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   `R_star` is the radius of the star.\n*   `A` is the planet's Bond albedo.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n**2. Forming the Ratio**\n\nWe want to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2:\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = [T_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₁))] / [T_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₂))]\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so `T_star` and `R_star` are the same for both and will cancel out. It is also given that both planets have the same albedo (A₁ = A₂), so the `(1 - A)^(1/4)` term also cancels out.\n\nThis simplifies the ratio to:\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₁)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₂))\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt( (R_star / (2 * a₁)) * ((2 * a₂) / R_star) )\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)\n\nSo, to find the temperature ratio, we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes of the planets' orbits.\n\n**3. Relating Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity Data**\n\nThe radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude (K) induced on a star by an orbiting planet in a circular orbit is given by:\nK = (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n\nWhere:\n*   `M_p` is the mass of the planet.\n*   `M_star` is the mass of the star.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis.\n(We assume an edge-on orbit, sin(i) ≈ 1, which is a reasonable assumption for planets detected via the transit method).\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for the semi-major axis `a`:\nK² = (M_p² / M_star²) * (G * M_star / a)\nK² = (G * M_p²) / (M_star * a)\na = (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\nNow, we can find the ratio a₂ / a₁:\na₂ / a₁ = [(G * M_p2²) / (M_star * K₂²)] / [(G * M_p1²) / (M_star * K₁²)]\nThe terms G and M_star cancel out, leaving:\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p2² / K₂²) * (K₁² / M_p1²) = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n**4. Relating RV Semi-Amplitude (K) to Doppler Shift (Δλ)**\n\nThe Doppler shift formula relates the change in wavelength (Δλ) to the radial velocity (v_r):\nΔλ / λ₀ = v_r / c\nThe maximum Doppler shift corresponds to the RV semi-amplitude K:\nK = c * (Δλ_max / λ₀)\n\nThe ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is therefore:\nK₁ / K₂ = [c * (Δλ₁ / λ₀)] / [c * (Δλ₂ / λ₀)] = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂\n\n**5.

Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:**\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its host star. The formula is:\nT_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\nWhere:\n*   T_star = Effective temperature of the star\n*   R_star = Radius of the star\n*   a = Semi-major axis of the planet's orbit\n*   A = Albedo of the planet\n\n**3. Formulate the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures:**\nWe need to find the ratio for the two planets:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a1))^(1/2) * (1 - A1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a2))^(1/2) * (1 - A2)^(1/4)]\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so T_star and R_star are identical for both. It is also given that they have the same albedo (A1 = A2). Therefore, most terms cancel out:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [(1 / a1)^(1/2)] / [(1 / a2)^(1/2)]\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a2 / a1)^(1/2) = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\nThe problem is now simplified to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes of the planets' orbits. Note that information like the star's mass, radius, temperature, and the planets' radii are not needed for this ratio calculation as they cancel out.\n\n**4. Relate the Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data:**\nThe problem provides data from the radial velocity (RV) method, specifically the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ) caused by each planet. The Doppler shift is related to the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (K_star) by the Doppler formula:\nK_star = c * (Δλ_max / λ_0)\nThis implies that K_star is directly proportional to Δλ_max.\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit (as stated in the problem) detected via the transit method (which implies the inclination `i` is ~90°, so sin(i) ≈ 1), the RV semi-amplitude is given by:\nK_star ≈ M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))\nWhere M_p is the planet's mass and M_star is the star's mass.\n\n**5.

For a planet in a circular orbit, the stellar RV semi-amplitude (`K_star`) is given by:\n`K_star ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)`\nwhere `M_p` is the planet's mass and `M_star` is the star's mass.\n\nRearranging for `a`:\n`K_star^2 = (M_p^2 / M_star^2) * (G * M_star / a)`\n`a = G * M_p^2 / (M_star * K_star^2)`\n\nNow we can find the ratio `a_2 / a_1`. The terms `G` and `M_star` are the same for both planets, so they cancel out:\n`a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2^2 / K_star2^2) / (M_p1^2 / K_star1^2) = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_star1 / K_star2)^2`\n\nThe Doppler shift `Δλ` is related to the velocity `K_star` by the formula `Δλ / λ_0 = K_star / c`, where `c` is the speed of light and `λ_0` is the rest wavelength of the spectral line. This means the ratio of velocities is equal to the ratio of their Doppler shifts:\n`K_star1 / K_star2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2`\n\nSubstituting this back into the equation for `a_2 / a_1`:\n`a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)^2`\n\nFinally, we substitute this into our temperature ratio equation:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1) = sqrt( (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)^2 )`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)`\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n- `M_p1` = 7 Earth masses\n- `M_p2` = 5 Earth masses\n- `Δλ_1` = 0.03 Å\n- `Δλ_2` = 0.04 Å\n\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04) = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4) = 15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nThe final result of the calculation is approximately 0.536.\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) ~ 1.05\nB) ~ 0.98\nC) ~ 0.53\nD) ~ 1.30\n\nThe calculated value `0.536` is closest to option `C`.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nThe reasoning and calculations performed are correct. The final answer is derived from the relationship between a planet's equilibrium temperature, its semi-major axis, and the observational data from the radial velocity method.\n\n**Summary of Logic:**\n1.  The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures (T_eq1 / T_eq2) for two planets around the same star with the same albedo simplifies to `sqrt(a2 / a1)`, where `a1` and `a2` are the semi-major axes of the planets.\n2.  The semi-major axis `a` can be related to the planet's mass (`M_p`) and the radial velocity semi-amplitude (`K`) it induces on the star by the formula `a ∝ M_p² / K²`.\n3.  The radial velocity semi-amplitude `K` is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift `Δλ` (`K ∝ Δλ`).\n4.  Combining these proportions, we find that `a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K1 / K2)² = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)²`.\n5.  Plugging in the given values:\n    *   M_p1 = 7, M_p2 = 5\n    *   Δλ1 = 0.03 Å, Δλ2 = 0.04 Å\n    *   `a2 / a1 = (5/7)² * (0.03/0.04)² = (25/49) * (3/4)² = (25/49) * (9/16) = 225 / 784`.\n6.  Finally, the temperature ratio is `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784) = 15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357`.\n\nThe python code correctly calculated this value, and the output `0.54` is the result rounded to two decimal places.

For a planet in a circular orbit, this amplitude is related to the planet's mass ($M_p$), the star's mass ($M_{star}$), and the semi-major axis ($a$) by the following formula (assuming the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass):\n    $K = \\frac{M_p}{M_{star}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_{star}}{a}}$\n    where G is the gravitational constant.\n\n6.  **Solve for the Semi-major Axis ($a$):** We can rearrange the formula to solve for $a$:\n    $K^2 = \\left( \\frac{M_p}{M_{star}} \\right)^2 \\frac{G M_{star}}{a} = \\frac{M_p^2 G}{M_{star} a}$\n    $a = \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_{star} K^2}$\n\n7.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-major Axes ($a_2/a_1$):**\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p,2}^2 / (M_{star} K_2^2)}{G M_{p,1}^2 / (M_{star} K_1^2)}$\n    The constants $G$ and $M_{star}$ cancel out, leaving:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p,2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p,1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n8.  **Determine the Input Ratios from the Problem Statement:**\n    *   **Mass Ratio:** $M_{p,1} = 7 M_{Earth}$, $M_{p,2} = 5 M_{Earth}$. So, $\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}} = \\frac{5}{7}$.\n    *   **RV Amplitude Ratio ($K_1/K_2$):** The RV amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$), since $K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max}}{\\lambda_0}$.

Simplify the Ratio**\nSeveral terms in the equation cancel out based on the problem statement:\n*   Both planets orbit the same star, so the star's temperature ($T_*$) and radius ($R_*$) are the same for both and cancel.\n*   The problem states that both planets have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$), so the $(1 - A)^{1/4}$ term also cancels.\n*   The factor of 2 in the denominator also cancels.\n\nAfter simplification, the equation becomes:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right)^{1/2}$\n\nThis means we only need to find the ratio of the orbital distances ($a_2 / a_1$) to determine the temperature ratio.\n\n**5. Relate Orbital Distance to Radial Velocity (RV) Data**\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$), which is the maximum speed of the star's wobble, is related to the planet's properties. For a planet in a circular orbit detected by the transit method (implying inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ and $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$), the formula is:\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$\nwhere $M_p$ is the planet mass, $M_*$ is the star mass, $G$ is the gravitational constant, and $a$ is the semi-major axis.\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for the semi-major axis, $a$:\n$\\sqrt{a} \\approx \\frac{M_p \\sqrt{G}}{K \\sqrt{M_*}}$\n$a \\approx \\frac{M_p^2 G}{K^2 M_*}$\n\n**6. Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes ($a_2/a_1$)**\nNow we can find the ratio of the semi-major axes by dividing the equation for Planet 2 by the equation for Planet 1:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{M_{p2}^2 G}{K_2^2 M_*} \\right)}{\\left( \\frac{M_{p1}^2 G}{K_1^2 M_*} \\right)}$\n\nThe gravitational constant ($G$) and the star's mass ($M_*$) cancel out, leaving:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n**7.

The other parameters given in the problem (star's mass, star's radius, star's temperature, planet radii, and the specific wavelength of the [OI] line) are not needed for this specific calculation, as they cancel out. The key relationships are between equilibrium temperature and orbital distance, and between orbital distance and the planet's mass and its induced radial velocity shift.\n\nThe derivation is as follows:\n$T_{eq} \\propto (1/a)^{1/2}$\n$K \\propto M_p / \\sqrt{a}$\n$K \\propto \\Delta \\lambda$\n\nFrom the second relation, $\\sqrt{a} \\propto M_p/K$.\nSubstitute this into the first relation:\n$T_{eq} \\propto 1/\\sqrt{a} \\propto K/M_p$.\nSubstitute the third relation into this:\n$T_{eq} \\propto \\Delta \\lambda / M_p$.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_1 / M_{p,1}}{\\Delta \\lambda_2 / M_{p,2}} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_1}{\\Delta \\lambda_2} \\times \\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}}$\n\nUsing the given values:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{0.03 \\text{ Å}}{0.04 \\text{ Å}} \\times \\frac{5 M_{\\oplus}}{7 M_{\\oplus}} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times \\frac{5}{7} = \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis matches the calculation from the code.

The problem also states that both planets have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). Therefore, these terms cancel out, simplifying the ratio to:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1^2)^{1/4}}{(1/a_2^2)^{1/4}} = \\frac{(a_2^2)^{1/4}}{(a_1^2)^{1/4}} = \\frac{a_2^{1/2}}{a_1^{1/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) induced by a planet on its star in a circular orbit (e=0) is given by:\n$K = \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{\\sqrt{M_{star}a}} \\sqrt{G}$\nwhere $M_p$ is the planet's mass, $M_{star}$ is the star's mass, a is the semi-major axis, G is the gravitational constant, and i is the orbital inclination. Since transits are observed for both planets, we can assume their orbits are edge-on, meaning the inclination $i \\approx 90°$ and $\\sin i \\approx 1$.\n\nFrom the formula above, we can solve for a:\n$\\sqrt{a} = \\frac{M_p \\sqrt{G}}{K \\sqrt{M_{star}}}$\n$a = \\frac{M_p^2 G}{K^2 M_{star}}$\n\nNow we can find the ratio $\\frac{a_2}{a_1}$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 G / (K_2^2 M_{star})}{M_{p1}^2 G / (K_1^2 M_{star})} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\nThe Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$ is directly proportional to the radial velocity (K), i.e., $K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$. Therefore, the ratio of the velocity amplitudes is equal to the ratio of their maximum Doppler shifts:\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n\nSubstitute this into the equation for the semi-major axis ratio:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)^2$\n\nFinally, substitute this back into the temperature ratio equation:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)$\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   $M_{p1}$ = 7 Earth masses\n*   $M_{p2}$ = 5 Earth masses\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_1$ = 0.03 Å\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_2$ = 0.04 Å\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe primary objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two exoplanets, Planet1 and Planet2, denoted as $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n\n**2. The Formula for Equilibrium Temperature**\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet orbiting a star is given by:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\times \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} \\times (1 - A)^{1/4}$\nwhere:\n*   $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n*   $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   `A` is the planet's bond albedo.\n\n**3. Formulate the Ratio**\nTo find the ratio $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$, we can divide the equation for Planet1 by the equation for Planet2:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\times (\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1})^{1/2} \\times (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{star} \\times (\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2})^{1/2} \\times (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are identical for both and cancel out. It is also given that both planets have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$), so the albedo term $(1 - A)^{1/4}$ also cancels. The formula simplifies significantly to:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThis means we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes of the planets' orbits.\n\n**4. Relate Observational Data to the Semi-Major Axis**\nThe problem provides information about the Doppler shift ($\\Delta \\lambda$) caused by each planet, which is measured by the radial velocity (RV) method. This shift is related to the star's RV semi-amplitude ($K$) by:\n$K = c \\times \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_{max}}{\\lambda_0}$\nwhere `c` is the speed of light and $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude `K` is related to the planet's mass ($M_p$) and its semi-major axis (`a`) by the following formula (assuming the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass, $M_p \\ll M_{star}$, and the orbit is viewed edge-on, $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$, which is a reasonable assumption for planets detected via the transit method):\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_{star}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_{star}}{a}}$\n\n**5.

The problem also states that both planets have the same albedo, so $A_1 = A_2$, and the $(1-A)^{1/4}$ terms cancel out.\n\nThe simplified ratio becomes:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_2} \\right)^{1/2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}$\n\nNow we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes, $\\frac{a_2}{a_1}$. We can find this from the radial velocity (RV) data. For a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude (K) induced by a planet is given by:\n\n$K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_s^{2/3}}$\n\nUsing Kepler's Third Law ($P^2 \\propto a^3$), this can be rewritten in terms of the semi-major axis, 'a'. A more direct formula relating K, a, and mass is:\n$K = \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_s} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_s}{a}}$ (for $M_p << M_s$)\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{M_s}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{a}}$ (assuming $sin i \\approx 1$)\n\nThe problem states that the planets were also detected by the transit method, which implies that their orbits are seen nearly edge-on. Therefore, we can assume the inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$, and thus $\\sin i \\approx 1$.\n\nLet's solve the equation for 'a':\n$K^2 = \\frac{M_p^2}{M_s} \\frac{G}{a}$\n$a = \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_s K^2}$\n\nNow we can find the ratio $\\frac{a_2}{a_1}$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_s K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_s K_1^2)} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 K_1^2}{M_{p1}^2 K_2^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\nThe RV semi-amplitude K is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) through the formula $K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$.

Since both planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, the terms T_star, R_star, and (1 - A) will cancel out:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude (K_star) induced by a planet on its star is related to the planet's mass (M_p) and its orbital semi-major axis (a) by:\nK_star ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a) = M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))\nwhere M_star is the mass of the star and G is the gravitational constant.\n\nThe Doppler shift (Δλ) is proportional to the radial velocity (K_star):\nΔλ / λ_0 = K_star / c  => K_star ∝ Δλ\n\nFrom the K_star formula, we can solve for 'a':\nK_star^2 = M_p^2 * G / (M_star * a)\na = (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * K_star^2)\n\nNow we can find the ratio a_2 / a_1:\na_2 / a_1 = [ (G * M_p2^2) / (M_star * K_star2^2) ] / [ (G * M_p1^2) / (M_star * K_star1^2) ]\na_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_star1 / K_star2)^2\n\nSince K_star ∝ Δλ, we have (K_star1 / K_star2) = (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2).

Identify the Goal:**\nThe question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, which can be written as `T_eq1 / T_eq2`.\n\n**2. Recall the Formula for Equilibrium Temperature:**\nThe equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) of a planet is given by:\n`T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`\nwhere:\n- `T_star` is the star's effective temperature.\n- `R_star` is the star's radius.\n- `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n- `A` is the planet's Bond albedo.\n\n**3. Set up the Ratio:**\nWe need to find the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2`:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a_1))^(1/2) * (1 - A_1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a_2))^(1/2) * (1 - A_2)^(1/4)]`\n\n**4. Simplify the Ratio:**\nSeveral terms are the same for both planets and will cancel out:\n- The star is the same, so `T_star` and `R_star` are constant.\n- The problem states that both planets have the same albedo (`A_1 = A_2`).\n- The factor of 2 is also a constant.\n\nAfter canceling these terms, the equation simplifies to:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (1 / a_1)^(1/2) / (1 / a_2)^(1/2)`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a_2 / a_1)^(1/2)`\n\nThis means the problem is now reduced to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes of the two planets (`a_2 / a_1`).\n\n**5. Relate Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity Data:**\nThe problem provides information from the radial velocity (RV) method. For a star-planet system with the planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (`K`) is given by:\n`K ≈ (M_p * sin(i)) / (M_star * a)^(1/2) * (G / M_star)^(1/2)`\n`K ≈ M_p * sin(i) * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))`\nwhere:\n- `M_p` is the planet's mass.\n- `M_star` is the star's mass.\n- `i` is the orbital inclination.\n- `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\nSince both planets were detected using the transit method, their orbits must be nearly edge-on to our line of sight. This means the inclination `i` is approximately 90°, and `sin(i) ≈ 1`. The formula simplifies to:\n`K ≈ M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))`\n\n**6. Solve for the Semi-Major Axis Ratio (`a_2 / a_1`):**\nLet's first rearrange the formula to solve for `a`:\n`K^2 = M_p^2 * (G / (M_star * a))`\n`a = (G / M_star) * (M_p^2 / K^2)`\n\nNow we can find the ratio `a_2 / a_1`:\n`a_2 / a_1 = [(G / M_star) * (M_p2^2 / K_2^2)] / [(G / M_star) * (M_p1^2 / K_1^2)]`\n\nThe term `(G / M_star)` cancels out, leaving:\n`a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2^2 / K_2^2) / (M_p1^2 / K_1^2)`\n`a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_1 / K_2)^2`\n\n**7.

It is also given that the planets have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). These terms cancel out, simplifying the equation significantly:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_2} \\right)^{1/2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n    To find the temperature ratio, we need to find the ratio of their semi-major axes ($a_2/a_1$).\n\n5.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity:** The radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is related to the planet's mass ($M_p$), the star's mass ($M_{star}$), and the semi-major axis ($a$). For a circular orbit and assuming the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass ($M_p \\ll M_{star}$), the formula is:\n    $K = \\left( \\frac{G}{a M_{star}} \\right)^{1/2} M_p \\sin(i)$\n    where $G$ is the gravitational constant and $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n    Since both planets were detected by the transit method, their orbits must be edge-on, meaning their inclination $i$ is approximately 90°, and thus $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$.\n\n6.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis (a):** We can rearrange the formula to solve for $a$:\n    $K^2 = \\frac{G}{a M_{star}} M_p^2 \\sin^2(i)$\n    $a = \\frac{G M_p^2 \\sin^2(i)}{K^2 M_{star}}$\n\n7.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes ($a_2/a_1$):**\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{\\frac{G M_{p,2}^2 \\sin^2(i_2)}{K_2^2 M_{star}}}{\\frac{G M_{p,1}^2 \\sin^2(i_1)}{K_1^2 M_{star}}}$\n    The terms $G$, $M_{star}$, and $\\sin^2(i)$ (since $i_1 \\approx i_2 \\approx 90^\\circ$) cancel out:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p,2}^2}{K_2^2} \\cdot \\frac{K_1^2}{M_{p,1}^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n8.  **Determine the Input Ratios:**\n    *   **Mass Ratio:** $M_{p,1} = 7 \\ M_{Earth}$, $M_{p,2} = 5 \\ M_{Earth}$.\n        $\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n    *   **RV Semi-Amplitude Ratio:** The Doppler shift, $\\Delta\\lambda$, is directly proportional to the radial velocity semi-amplitude, K.\n        $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å, $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å.\n        $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n9.  **Substitute and Calculate:**\n    *   First, calculate the ratio of semi-major axes:\n        $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\cdot \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n    *   Now, calculate the ratio of equilibrium temperatures:\n        $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{225}}{\\sqrt{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n10. **Final Answer:** Convert the fraction to a decimal.\n    $\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{A}$.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe equilibrium temperature of a planet (T_eq) is determined by the energy balance between the stellar radiation it absorbs and the thermal radiation it emits. The formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\nWhere:\n*   T_star is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   R_star is the radius of the star.\n*   'a' is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   'A' is the planet's Bond albedo.\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for Planet1 and Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (R_star / (2*a1))^(1/2) * (1 - A1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2*a2))^(1/2) * (1 - A2)^(1/4)]\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star (T_star and R_star are constant) and have the same albedo (A1 = A2), most terms cancel out:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [(1/a1)^(1/2)] / [(1/a2)^(1/2)] = (a2 / a1)^(1/2) = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\nNow, we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes (a2 / a1) using the radial velocity (RV) data. The RV amplitude (K) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n\nK = (M_p / M_star) * v_orbital = (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\nK = (M_p / sqrt(M_star)) * sqrt(G / a)\n\nRearranging for 'a':\nsqrt(a) = (M_p * sqrt(G)) / (K * sqrt(M_star))\na = (M_p^2 * G) / (K^2 * M_star)\n\nNow, let's find the ratio a2 / a1. The constants G and M_star will cancel out:\na2 / a1 = [M_p2^2 / K2^2] / [M_p1^2 / K1^2]\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2\n\nThe ratio of RV amplitudes (K1 / K2) is directly proportional to the ratio of their observed Doppler shifts (Δλ1 / Δλ2).\n\nGiven:\n*   M_p1 = 7 M_earth, M_p2 = 5 M_earth  =>  M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n*   Δλ1 = 0.03 Å, Δλ2 = 0.04 Å  =>  K1 / K2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\nNow substitute these into the equation for a2 / a1:\na2 / a1 = (5/7)^2 * (3/4)^2\n\nFinally, substitute this back into the temperature ratio equation:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1) = sqrt( (5/7)^2 * (3/4)^2 )\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5/7) * (3/4)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is closest to 0.53.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe calculation shows that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 0.5357.\n\nLet's compare this result with the given options:\nA) ~ 1.05\nB) ~ 0.98\nC) ~ 1.30\nD) ~ 0.53\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.5357 is closest to option D.\n\nFinal verification of the steps:\n- The formula for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1) is correct for planets around the same star with the same albedo.\n- The formula relating the semi-major axis 'a' to the RV semi-amplitude 'K' and planet mass 'M_p' is a = (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * K^2) for circular orbits viewed edge-on (sin(i)=1).\n- The ratio of semi-major axes a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_1 / K_2)^2 is derived correctly.\n- The RV semi-amplitude K is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift Δλ (K = c * Δλ / λ_0), so the ratio K_1 / K_2 is equal to the ratio Δλ_1 / Δλ_2.\n- The values used for the ratios are correct: M_p2 / M_p1 = 5/7 and K_1 / K_2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4.\n- The final calculation T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt((5/7)^2 * (3/4)^2) = sqrt(225/784) = 15/28 ≈ 0.5357 is arithmetically sound.\n\nThe reasoning and calculation are correct. The final answer matches option D.<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nTo find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2), we start with the formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a)) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\nWhere:\n*   `T_star` = Star's effective temperature\n*   `R_star` = Star's radius\n*   `a` = Planet's semi-major axis\n*   `A` = Planet's albedo\n\nWe want to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2. Since both planets orbit the same star (`T_star` and `R_star` are constant) and have the same albedo (`A` is constant), these terms cancel out in the ratio:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\nThis means we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes. We can derive this from the radial velocity (RV) data. For a circular orbit, the star's RV semi-amplitude (K) is given by:\n\nK ∝ M_p / sqrt(a)\nwhere `M_p` is the planet's mass.\n\nFrom this, we can write:\nK1 ∝ M1 / sqrt(a1)\nK2 ∝ M2 / sqrt(a2)\n\nNow, we can solve for `sqrt(a)`:\nsqrt(a) ∝ M_p / K\n\nThen, the ratio `sqrt(a2) / sqrt(a1)` is:\nsqrt(a2) / sqrt(a1) = (M2 / K2) / (M1 / K1) = (M2 / M1) * (K1 / K2)\n\nWe know that T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1) = sqrt(a2) / sqrt(a1). Therefore:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M2 / M1) * (K1 / K2)\n\nThe ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes (K1 / K2) is equal to the ratio of the maximum Doppler shifts (Δλ1 / Δλ2):\nK1 / K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2 = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3 / 4\n\nThe ratio of the masses is:\nM2 / M1 = 5 Earth masses / 7 Earth masses = 5 / 7\n\nNow, we can calculate the temperature ratio:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4) = 15 / 28\n\nConverting this to a decimal:\n15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2), we can follow these steps:\n\n**1. The Formula for Equilibrium Temperature**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n\nWhere:\n*   `T_star` is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   `R_star` is the radius of the star.\n*   `A` is the planet's Bond albedo.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n**2. Forming the Ratio**\n\nWe want to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2:\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = [T_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₁))] / [T_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₂))]\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so `T_star` and `R_star` are the same for both and will cancel out. It is also given that both planets have the same albedo (A₁ = A₂), so the `(1 - A)^(1/4)` term also cancels out.\n\nThis simplifies the ratio to:\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₁)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₂))\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt( (R_star / (2 * a₁)) * ((2 * a₂) / R_star) )\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)\n\nSo, to find the temperature ratio, we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes of the planets' orbits.\n\n**3. Relating Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity Data**\n\nThe radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude (K) induced on a star by an orbiting planet in a circular orbit is given by:\nK = (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n\nWhere:\n*   `M_p` is the mass of the planet.\n*   `M_star` is the mass of the star.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis.\n(We assume an edge-on orbit, sin(i) ≈ 1, which is a reasonable assumption for planets detected via the transit method).\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for the semi-major axis `a`:\nK² = (M_p² / M_star²) * (G * M_star / a)\nK² = (G * M_p²) / (M_star * a)\na = (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\nNow, we can find the ratio a₂ / a₁:\na₂ / a₁ = [(G * M_p2²) / (M_star * K₂²)] / [(G * M_p1²) / (M_star * K₁²)]\nThe terms G and M_star cancel out, leaving:\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p2² / K₂²) * (K₁² / M_p1²) = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n**4. Relating RV Semi-Amplitude (K) to Doppler Shift (Δλ)**\n\nThe Doppler shift formula relates the change in wavelength (Δλ) to the radial velocity (v_r):\nΔλ / λ₀ = v_r / c\nThe maximum Doppler shift corresponds to the RV semi-amplitude K:\nK = c * (Δλ_max / λ₀)\n\nThe ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is therefore:\nK₁ / K₂ = [c * (Δλ₁ / λ₀)] / [c * (Δλ₂ / λ₀)] = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂\n\n**5. Final Calculation**\n\nSubstitute the expression for K₁/K₂ back into the equation for a₂/a₁:\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)²\n\nNow, substitute this into our simplified temperature ratio equation:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁) = sqrt( (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)² )\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)\n\nFinally, plug in the given values:\n*   Mass of Planet 1 (M_p1) = 7 Earth masses\n*   Mass of Planet 2 (M_p2) = 5 Earth masses\n*   Doppler shift for Planet 1 (Δλ₁) = 0.03 Å\n*   Doppler shift for Planet 2 (Δλ₂) = 0.04 Å\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThe equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by the formula:\n`T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))`\nwhere:\n*   `T_star` is the star's effective temperature.\n*   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n*   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, `T_eq1 / T_eq2`.\n\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))] / [T_star * (1 - A2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))]`\n\nAccording to the problem statement:\n*   Both planets orbit the same star, so `T_star` and `R_star` are the same for both.\n*   Both planets have the same albedo, so `A1 = A2`.\n\nThese common terms cancel out in the ratio, simplifying the equation to:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)`\n\nNow, we need to determine the ratio of the semi-major axes, `a2 / a1`. We can find this using the information from the radial velocity (RV) method. For a planet in a circular orbit, the amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) is given by:\n`K = M_p * sin(i) / sqrt(1 - e^2) * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))`\nSince the planets are detected via the transit method, we can assume the inclination `i` is close to 90 degrees, so `sin(i) ≈ 1`. The orbits are circular, so the eccentricity `e = 0`. The formula simplifies to:\n`K = M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))`\n\nLet's rearrange this to solve for the semi-major axis `a`:\n`K^2 = M_p^2 * (G / (M_star * a))`\n`a = (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * K^2)`\n\nNow we can find the ratio `a2 / a1`:\n`a2 / a1 = [(G * M_p2^2) / (M_star * K2^2)] / [(G * M_p1^2) / (M_star * K1^2)]`\n\nThe gravitational constant `G` and the star's mass `M_star` cancel out:\n`a2 / a1 = (M_p2^2 / K2^2) * (K1^2 / M_p1^2)`\n`a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2`\n\nThe radial velocity `v_r` is related to the Doppler shift `Δλ` by the formula `v_r = c * (Δλ / λ_0)`. The velocity amplitude `K` is therefore directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift `Δλ_max`.\n`K1 / K2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2`\n\nFrom the problem statement:\n*   Mass of Planet1 (`M_p1`) = 7 Earth masses\n*   Mass of Planet2 (`M_p2`) = 5 Earth masses\n*   Doppler shift for Planet1 (`Δλ_1`) = 0.03 Å\n*   Doppler shift for Planet2 (`Δλ_2`) = 0.04 Å\n\nNow, we can calculate the ratios:\n*   `M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7`\n*   `K1 / K2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4`\n\nSubstitute these into the equation for `a2 / a1`:\n`a2 / a1 = (5/7)^2 * (3/4)^2 = (25/49) * (9/16) = 225 / 784`\n\nFinally, we calculate the temperature ratio:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1) = sqrt(225 / 784) = 15 / 28`\n\n`15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{A}$.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThe calculation shows that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 0.5357.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~ 1.05\nB) ~ 0.53\nC) ~ 0.98\nD) ~ 1.30\n\nThe calculated value of 0.5357 is closest to 0.53.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThe equilibrium temperature of a planet (T_eq) is given by the formula:\n\nT_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\nwhere T_star is the star's effective temperature, R_star is the star's radius, `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, and `A` is the planet's albedo.\n\nWe need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a_1))^(1/2) * (1 - A_1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a_2))^(1/2) * (1 - A_2)^(1/4)]\n\nSince the planets orbit the same star (T_star and R_star are the same) and have the same albedo (A_1 = A_2), these terms cancel out:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [(1 / a_1)^(1/2)] / [(1 / a_2)^(1/2)] = (a_2 / a_1)^(1/2)\n\nNow we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes, a_2 / a_1. We can do this using the information from the radial velocity (RV) method. The stellar radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n\nK = (M_p * sin(i) / M_star^(1/2)) * (G / a)^(1/2)\n\nwhere M_p is the planet's mass, M_star is the star's mass, `i` is the orbital inclination, and G is the gravitational constant.\n\nBy rearranging this equation to solve for `a`, we get:\n\na = G * (M_p^2 * sin^2(i)) / (K^2 * M_star)\n\nNow we can find the ratio a_2 / a_1:\n\na_2 / a_1 = [G * (M_p2^2 * sin^2(i_2)) / (K_2^2 * M_star)] / [G * (M_p1^2 * sin^2(i_1)) / (K_1^2 * M_star)]\n\nSince both planets were detected by the transit method, their orbital inclinations `i` are close to 90°, so sin(i) ≈ 1 for both.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning.\n\n**1. Define the Goal:**\nThe objective is to compute the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, denoted as T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n**2. Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:**\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its host star. The formula is:\nT_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\nWhere:\n*   T_star = Effective temperature of the star\n*   R_star = Radius of the star\n*   a = Semi-major axis of the planet's orbit\n*   A = Albedo of the planet\n\n**3. Formulate the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures:**\nWe need to find the ratio for the two planets:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a1))^(1/2) * (1 - A1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a2))^(1/2) * (1 - A2)^(1/4)]\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so T_star and R_star are identical for both. It is also given that they have the same albedo (A1 = A2). Therefore, most terms cancel out:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [(1 / a1)^(1/2)] / [(1 / a2)^(1/2)]\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a2 / a1)^(1/2) = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\nThe problem is now simplified to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes of the planets' orbits. Note that information like the star's mass, radius, temperature, and the planets' radii are not needed for this ratio calculation as they cancel out.\n\n**4. Relate the Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data:**\nThe problem provides data from the radial velocity (RV) method, specifically the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ) caused by each planet. The Doppler shift is related to the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (K_star) by the Doppler formula:\nK_star = c * (Δλ_max / λ_0)\nThis implies that K_star is directly proportional to Δλ_max.\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit (as stated in the problem) detected via the transit method (which implies the inclination `i` is ~90°, so sin(i) ≈ 1), the RV semi-amplitude is given by:\nK_star ≈ M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))\nWhere M_p is the planet's mass and M_star is the star's mass.\n\n**5. Solve for the Semi-Major Axis `a`:**\nWe can rearrange the formula for K_star to solve for `a`:\nK_star^2 ≈ M_p^2 * G / (M_star * a)\na ≈ (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * K_star^2)\n\n**6. Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes (a2 / a1):**\nNow we can create the ratio of the semi-major axes for Planet2 and Planet1. The gravitational constant (G) and the star's mass (M_star) will cancel out.\na2 / a1 = [(G * M_p2^2) / (M_star * K_star2^2)] / [(G * M_p1^2) / (M_star * K_star1^2)]\na2 / a1 = (M_p2^2 / K_star2^2) * (K_star1^2 / M_p1^2)\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_star1 / K_star2)^2\n\n**7.

Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:**\nFinally, we substitute the value of a2 / a1 back into the temperature ratio equation from Step 3:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nComparing this result to the given options, 0.5357 is closest to 0.53.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe equilibrium temperature of a planet ($T_{\\text{eq}}$) is given by the formula:\n$T_{\\text{eq}} = T_{\\text{star}} \\left( \\frac{R_{\\text{star}}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1-A)^{1/4}$\nwhere $T_{\\text{star}}$ is the star's effective temperature, $R_{\\text{star}}$ is the star's radius, $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, and $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, $T_{\\text{eq1}} / T_{\\text{eq2}}$.\n$\\frac{T_{\\text{eq1}}}{T_{\\text{eq2}}} = \\frac{T_{\\text{star}} \\left( \\frac{R_{\\text{star}}}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1-A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{\\text{star}} \\left( \\frac{R_{\\text{star}}}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1-A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star, $T_{\\text{star}}$ and $R_{\\text{star}}$ are the same for both.

We can determine this from the radial velocity (RV) data. The maximum RV shift, or semi-amplitude (K), is related to the maximum Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) by the formula $K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$, where $c$ is the speed of light and $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line. Since $c$ and $\\lambda_0$ are constant, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the maximum Doppler shifts:\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\text{ Å}}{0.04 \\text{ Å}} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude of the star is given by:\n$K = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{P} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_{\\text{star}}^{2/3}}$\nwhere P is the orbital period, $M_p$ is the planet mass, $M_{\\text{star}}$ is the star mass, and $i$ is the orbital inclination.\nUsing Kepler's Third Law ($P^2 \\propto a^3/M_{\\text{star}}$), we can write the period as $P = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{a^3}{G(M_{\\text{star}}+M_p)}}$. Since $M_p \\ll M_{\\text{star}}$, we can approximate this as $P \\approx 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{a^3}{GM_{\\text{star}}}}$.\nSubstituting this into the equation for K:\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_{\\text{star}}} \\sqrt{\\frac{GM_{\\text{star}}}{a}}$\nSince both planets were detected by the transit method, their orbits must be viewed nearly edge-on, so we can assume the inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ and $\\sin i \\approx 1$.\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_{\\text{star}}} \\sqrt{\\frac{GM_{\\text{star}}}{a}} = \\frac{M_p \\sqrt{G}}{\\sqrt{M_{\\text{star}} a}}$\n\nNow we can set up a ratio for the semi-major axes.

The problem also states that both planets have the same albedo (A1 = A2). Thus, the formula simplifies to:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = ((1/a1)^(1/2)) / ((1/a2)^(1/2)) = (a2/a1)^(1/2)`\n\nNow we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes, a2/a1. We can use the information from the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV semi-amplitude, K, is related to the planet's mass (M_p) and semi-major axis (a) for a circular orbit (and assuming M_p << M_star) by:\n`K ≈ (M_p * sin(i) / M_star^(1/2)) * (G/a)^(1/2)`\nwhere G is the gravitational constant and i is the orbital inclination. Since both planets were detected via the transit method, their orbital inclination must be close to 90 degrees, so sin(i) ≈ 1 for both.\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for 'a':\n`a ≈ G * (M_p^2 * sin^2(i)) / (M_star * K^2)`\n\nNow we can find the ratio a2/a1.

Since both planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, the terms `T_star`, `R_star`, and `A` cancel out in the ratio:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)`\n\nNext, we need to find the semi-major axis (`a`) for each planet using the radial velocity (RV) data. For a planet in a circular orbit, the stellar RV semi-amplitude (`K_star`) is given by:\n`K_star ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)`\nwhere `M_p` is the planet's mass and `M_star` is the star's mass.\n\nRearranging for `a`:\n`K_star^2 = (M_p^2 / M_star^2) * (G * M_star / a)`\n`a = G * M_p^2 / (M_star * K_star^2)`\n\nNow we can find the ratio `a_2 / a_1`.

The final answer is derived from the relationship between a planet's equilibrium temperature, its semi-major axis, and the observational data from the radial velocity method.\n\n**Summary of Logic:**\n1.  The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures (T_eq1 / T_eq2) for two planets around the same star with the same albedo simplifies to `sqrt(a2 / a1)`, where `a1` and `a2` are the semi-major axes of the planets.\n2.  The semi-major axis `a` can be related to the planet's mass (`M_p`) and the radial velocity semi-amplitude (`K`) it induces on the star by the formula `a ∝ M_p² / K²`.\n3.  The radial velocity semi-amplitude `K` is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift `Δλ` (`K ∝ Δλ`).\n4.  Combining these proportions, we find that `a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K1 / K2)² = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)²`.\n5.

The other parameters given in the problem (star's mass, star's radius, star's temperature, planet radii, and the specific wavelength of the [OI] line) are not needed for this specific calculation, as they cancel out. The key relationships are between equilibrium temperature and orbital distance, and between orbital distance and the planet's mass and its induced radial velocity shift.\n\nThe derivation is as follows:\n$T_{eq} \\propto (1/a)^{1/2}$\n$K \\propto M_p / \\sqrt{a}$\n$K \\propto \\Delta \\lambda$\n\nFrom the second relation, $\\sqrt{a} \\propto M_p/K$.\nSubstitute this into the first relation:\n$T_{eq} \\propto 1/\\sqrt{a} \\propto K/M_p$.\nSubstitute the third relation into this:\n$T_{eq} \\propto \\Delta \\lambda / M_p$.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_1 / M_{p,1}}{\\Delta \\lambda_2 / M_{p,2}} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_1}{\\Delta \\lambda_2} \\times \\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}}$\n\nUsing the given values:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{0.03 \\text{ Å}}{0.04 \\text{ Å}} \\times \\frac{5 M_{\\oplus}}{7 M_{\\oplus}} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times \\frac{5}{7} = \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis matches the calculation from the code.

Since transits are observed for both planets, we can assume their orbits are edge-on, meaning the inclination $i \\approx 90°$ and $\\sin i \\approx 1$.\n\nFrom the formula above, we can solve for a:\n$\\sqrt{a} = \\frac{M_p \\sqrt{G}}{K \\sqrt{M_{star}}}$\n$a = \\frac{M_p^2 G}{K^2 M_{star}}$\n\nNow we can find the ratio $\\frac{a_2}{a_1}$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 G / (K_2^2 M_{star})}{M_{p1}^2 G / (K_1^2 M_{star})} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\nThe Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$ is directly proportional to the radial velocity (K), i.e., $K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$.

Understand the Goal**\nThe primary objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two exoplanets, Planet1 and Planet2, denoted as $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n\n**2. The Formula for Equilibrium Temperature**\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet orbiting a star is given by:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\times \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} \\times (1 - A)^{1/4}$\nwhere:\n*   $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n*   $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   `A` is the planet's bond albedo.\n\n**3. Formulate the Ratio**\nTo find the ratio $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$, we can divide the equation for Planet1 by the equation for Planet2:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\times (\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1})^{1/2} \\times (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{star} \\times (\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2})^{1/2} \\times (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are identical for both and cancel out. It is also given that both planets have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$), so the albedo term $(1 - A)^{1/4}$ also cancels. The formula simplifies significantly to:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThis means we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes of the planets' orbits.\n\n**4. Relate Observational Data to the Semi-Major Axis**\nThe problem provides information about the Doppler shift ($\\Delta \\lambda$) caused by each planet, which is measured by the radial velocity (RV) method. This shift is related to the star's RV semi-amplitude ($K$) by:\n$K = c \\times \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_{max}}{\\lambda_0}$\nwhere `c` is the speed of light and $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude `K` is related to the planet's mass ($M_p$) and its semi-major axis (`a`) by the following formula (assuming the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass, $M_p \\ll M_{star}$, and the orbit is viewed edge-on, $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$, which is a reasonable assumption for planets detected via the transit method):\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_{star}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_{star}}{a}}$\n\n**5.

Therefore, the ratio of the K values is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n\nGiven values from the problem:\n*   $M_{p1}$ = 7 Earth masses\n*   $M_{p2}$ = 5 Earth masses\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_1$ = 0.03 Å\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_2$ = 0.04 Å\n\nFirst, let's compute the ratios:\n*   $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n*   $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nNow, plug these into the equation for the semi-major axis ratio:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\times \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\nFinally, calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nConverting the fraction to a decimal:\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nThe equilibrium temperature of a planet ($T_{eq}$) is given by the formula:\n\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a}} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n\nwhere:\n*   $T_{star}$ is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   $R_{star}$ is the radius of the star.\n*   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   $A$ is the albedo of the planet.\n\nWe want to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 to Planet2, which is $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$.\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1}} (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{star} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2}} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star, $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same for both and cancel out. The problem states that both planets have the same albedo, so $A_1 = A_2$, and the term $(1-A)^{1/4}$ also cancels out. The constant 2 also cancels out. This simplifies the expression to:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nTo find the temperature ratio, we first need to determine the ratio of the semi-major axes ($a_2/a_1$).\n\nThe radial velocity (RV) method gives us the star's velocity semi-amplitude (K), which is caused by the planet's gravitational pull. For a circular orbit and assuming the planet's mass ($M_p$) is much smaller than the star's mass ($M_{star}$), the formula is:\n\n$K = \\frac{M_p}{M_{star}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_{star}}{a}}$\n\nWe can solve for the semi-major axis, $a$:\n\n$K^2 = (\\frac{M_p}{M_{star}})^2 \\frac{G M_{star}}{a}$\n$a = \\frac{M_p^2 G M_{star}}{M_{star}^2 K^2} = \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_{star} K^2}$\n\nNow we can set up the ratio $a_2 / a_1$:\n\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{\\frac{G M_{p2}^2}{M_{star} K_2^2}}{\\frac{G M_{p1}^2}{M_{star} K_1^2}}$\n\nThe gravitational constant G and the star's mass $M_{star}$ are the same for both planets, so they cancel out:\n\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = (\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}})^2 (\\frac{K_1}{K_2})^2$\n\nThe radial velocity $v_r$ is related to the Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$ and the speed of light c by the formula $v_r/c = \\Delta\\lambda/\\lambda_0$. Thus, the velocity semi-amplitude K is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$, i.e., $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max}$. Therefore, the ratio $K_1/K_2$ is equal to the ratio $\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2$.\n\nWe are given:\n*   Mass of Planet1, $M_{p1} = 7 M_{Earth}$\n*   Mass of Planet2, $M_{p2} = 5 M_{Earth}$\n*   Doppler shift for Planet1, $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n*   Doppler shift for Planet2, $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\nFirst, we calculate the ratios:\n*   $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n*   $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nNow, substitute these into the equation for the semi-major axis ratio:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = (\\frac{5}{7})^2 (\\frac{3}{4})^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\times \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\nFinally, substitute this back into the temperature ratio equation:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nConverting the fraction to a decimal:\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nThe equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by the formula:\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\nwhere:\n*   T_star is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   R_star is the radius of the star.\n*   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A_1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1))] / [T_star * (1 - A_2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))]\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star (T_star and R_star are constant) and have the same albedo (A_1 = A_2). Therefore, most terms in the ratio cancel out:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(1 / a_1) / sqrt(1 / a_2)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n\nNow, we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes, a_2 / a_1. We can derive this from the radial velocity (RV) information.\n\nThe star's RV semi-amplitude (K) is related to the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ_max) by:\nK = c * (Δλ_max / λ_0)\nwhere `c` is the speed of light and λ_0 is the rest wavelength. Since `c` and λ_0 are the same for both measurements, the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is simply the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\nK_1 / K_2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3 / 4\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit (as stated) and an edge-on view (implied by the transit detection method, so sin(i) ≈ 1), the RV semi-amplitude is given by (assuming the planet's mass M_p is much smaller than the star's mass M_star):\nK ≈ M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))\n\nWe can solve this for the semi-major axis, `a`:\nK^2 ≈ (M_p^2 * G) / (M_star * a)\na ≈ (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * K^2)\n\nNow we can find the ratio a_2 / a_1:\na_2 / a_1 = [(G * M_p2^2) / (M_star * K_2^2)] / [(G * M_p1^2) / (M_star * K_1^2)]\n\nThe gravitational constant G and the star's mass M_star cancel out:\na_2 / a_1 = (M_p2^2 / K_2^2) * (K_1^2 / M_p1^2)\na_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_1 / K_2)^2\n\nWe are given the following values:\n*   M_p1 = 7 M_earth\n*   M_p2 = 5 M_earth\n*   K_1 / K_2 = 3 / 4\n\nSubstitute these values into the equation for a_2 / a_1:\na_2 / a_1 = (5 M_earth / 7 M_earth)^2 * (3 / 4)^2\na_2 / a_1 = (5/7)^2 * (3/4)^2\na_2 / a_1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\na_2 / a_1 = 225 / 784\n\nFinally, we can calculate the temperature ratio:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1) = sqrt(225 / 784)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{A}$.\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>."
