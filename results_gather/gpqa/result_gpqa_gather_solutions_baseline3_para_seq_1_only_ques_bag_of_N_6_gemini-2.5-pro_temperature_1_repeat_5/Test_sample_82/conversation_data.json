Calculate the Concentration of Acetic Acid After Dilution**\n\nFirst, the initial 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. We need to find the new concentration of the acetic acid solution before titration begins.\n\n*   Initial Molarity (M₁) = 0.05 M\n*   Initial Volume (V₁) = 20.00 cm³\n*   Final Volume (V₂) = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   The new molarity (M₂) can be found using the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂.\n    M₂ = (M₁ * V₁) / V₂ = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M\n\nSo, the titration is performed on a 40.00 cm³ solution of 0.025 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n\n**2. Calculate the pH at 25% Titration**\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the weak acid (CH₃COOH) has been neutralized by the strong base (NaOH) to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). This creates a buffer solution containing both the weak acid and its conjugate base.\n\n*   The reaction is: CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n*   At this point, the ratio of the concentration of the conjugate base to the weak acid is [CH₃COO⁻]/[CH₃COOH] = 25/75 = 1/3.\n\nWe can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH of this buffer:\npH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n\n*   Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n*   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n\n**3. Calculate the pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been completely neutralized by the NaOH. The solution now contains only the salt, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa), which dissociates into Na⁺ and the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻). The acetate ion is a weak base and will hydrolyze water, making the solution basic.\n\n*   **Step a: Find the moles of acid.**\n    Moles of CH₃COOH = Molarity × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.040 L = 0.001 mol.\n\n*   **Step b: Find the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point.**\n    At equivalence, moles of NaOH = moles of CH₃COOH = 0.001 mol.\n    Volume of NaOH = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³.\n\n*   **Step c: Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) at the equivalence point.**\n    Total Volume = Volume of acid solution + Volume of NaOH added = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n    Concentration of CH₃COO⁻ = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n\n*   **Step d: Calculate the pH from the hydrolysis of the acetate ion.**\n    The hydrolysis reaction is: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n    We need the base dissociation constant (Kb) for the acetate ion.\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n    Now, we set up an ICE table for the hydrolysis, where x = [OH⁻]:\n    Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    Since Kb is very small, we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.\n    5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = x² / 0.02\n    x² = (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02 = 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    x = [OH⁻] = √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n\n*   **Step e: Calculate pOH and then pH.**\n    pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52\n\nThe pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\nThe calculated values are pH ≈ 4.26 at 25% titration and pH ≈ 8.52 at the equivalence point. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning for solving the problem:\n\n### **Part 1: Dilution of Acetic Acid**\n\nFirst, we need to determine the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted. The initial solution is 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and it's diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water.\n\n*   **Initial Volume (V₁):** 20.00 cm³\n*   **Initial Concentration (M₁):** 0.05 M\n*   **Final Volume (V₂):** 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   **Final Concentration (M₂):** ?\n\nWe use the dilution formula **M₁V₁ = M₂V₂**:\n(0.05 M) × (20.00 cm³) = M₂ × (40.00 cm³)\nM₂ = (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³\n**M₂ = 0.025 M**\n\nSo, the titration is performed on a 40.00 cm³ solution of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n### **Part 2: pH at 25% Titration**\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (CH₃COOH) has reacted with the NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), while 75% of the acetic acid remains unreacted. This creates a buffer solution.\n\nThe reaction is: **CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O**\n\nWe can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH of this buffer:\n**pH = pKa + log ( [A⁻] / [HA] )**\n\n1.  **Calculate pKa:**\n    *   Given Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n    *   pKa = -log₁₀(Ka) = -log₁₀(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n\n2.  **Determine the ratio [A⁻] / [HA]:**\n    *   [A⁻] corresponds to the 25% that has reacted.\n    *   [HA] corresponds to the 75% that remains.\n    *   The ratio is 25 / 75 = 1/3.\n\n3.  **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   pH = pKa + log(1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log(0.333...)\n    *   pH = 4.73 - 0.477\n    *   **pH ≈ 4.26**\n\n### **Part 3: pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the initial acetic acid has been completely neutralized by the NaOH, forming acetate ions (CH₃COO⁻) in the solution.\n\n1.  **Calculate initial moles of acetic acid:**\n    *   Moles = Concentration × Volume\n    *   Moles of CH₃COOH = 0.025 mol/L × (40.00 cm³ / 1000 cm³/L) = 0.001 mol\n\n2.  **Determine the volume of NaOH added:**\n    *   At equivalence, moles of NaOH = moles of CH₃COOH = 0.001 mol.\n    *   Volume NaOH = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³\n\n3.  **Calculate the total volume and concentration of acetate:**\n    *   Total Volume = Initial volume of acid solution + Volume of NaOH added\n    *   Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n    *   The moles of acetate formed are equal to the initial moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001 mol.\n    *   Concentration of acetate [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = **0.02 M**\n\n4.  **Calculate the pH of the acetate solution:**\n    *   Acetate is a weak base and hydrolyzes in water: **CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻**\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb. We can find it from Ka using the ion product of water (Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C).\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n    *   We set up an equilibrium expression: Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    *   Let x = [OH⁻]. Then: 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x). Assuming x is very small compared to 0.02, we get:\n    *   x² ≈ (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 ≈ 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] ≈ √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n\n5.  **Calculate pOH and then pH:**\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14.00 - 5.48 = **8.52**\n\nThe calculated values are pH ≈ 4.26 at 25% titration and pH ≈ 8.52 at the equivalence point. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\n**Detailed Step-by-Step Derivation:**\n\n**1. Calculate the Concentration of Acetic Acid After Dilution**\n\n*   **Initial state:** We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n*   **Dilution:** We add 20.00 cm³ of water.\n*   **Final volume (V₂):** 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³\n*   **Use the dilution formula (M₁V₁ = M₂V₂):**\n    *   M₁ = 0.05 M\n    *   V₁ = 20.00 cm³\n    *   V₂ = 40.00 cm³\n    *   M₂ = (M₁V₁) / V₂ = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = **0.025 M**\n*   So, the solution being titrated is 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n**2. Calculate the pH at 25% Titration**\n\n*   At any point during the titration before the equivalence point, we have a buffer solution containing both acetic acid (HA) and its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻).\n*   The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used for buffer pH calculations:\n    **pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])**\n*   **Calculate pKa:**\n    *   Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n    *   pKa = -log₁₀(Ka) = -log₁₀(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n*   **Determine the ratio of [A⁻]/[HA]:**\n    *   At 25% titration, 25% of the original acid (HA) has been converted into its conjugate base (A⁻), and 75% of the acid remains.\n    *   The ratio [A⁻]/[HA] is 25/75, which simplifies to 1/3.\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log₁₀(1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.73 - log₁₀(3)\n    *   pH = 4.73 - 0.477\n    *   **pH ≈ 4.26**\n\n**3. Calculate the pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n*   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH to form sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The solution now contains only the conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), which hydrolyzes water.\n    **CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻**\n*   **Step 3.1: Find the moles of acid and the volume of NaOH needed.**\n    *   Moles of acid = Concentration × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.0400 L = 0.001 mol\n    *   At equivalence, moles of NaOH = moles of acid = 0.001 mol.\n    *   Volume of NaOH added = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n*   **Step 3.2: Find the concentration of acetate ([A⁻]) at the equivalence point.**\n    *   Total volume = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n    *   Concentration of acetate = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = **0.02 M**\n*   **Step 3.3: Calculate the [OH⁻] from the hydrolysis reaction.**\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate: Kb = Kw / Ka\n    *   Kb = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n    *   For the hydrolysis equilibrium, Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]. Let x = [OH⁻].\n    *   5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02)\n    *   x² = (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02 = 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n*   **Step 3.4: Calculate pOH and then pH.**\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.48 = **8.52**\n\nThe calculated pH at 25% titration is **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis problem requires calculating the pH at two specific points during the titration of acetic acid with NaOH: at 25% of the way to the equivalence point and at the equivalence point itself.\n\n### **Step 1: Dilution of Acetic Acid**\n\nFirst, we calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted with water.\n*   Initial volume of acetic acid (V1) = 20.00 cm³\n*   Initial concentration of acetic acid (M1) = 0.05 M\n*   Final volume after adding water (V2) = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³\n*   Using the dilution formula M1V1 = M2V2, we can find the new concentration (M2):\n    M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2 = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M\n    So, the concentration of the acetic acid (CH₃COOH) to be titrated is **0.025 M**.\n\n### **Step 2: pH at 25% Titration**\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH to form its conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH₃COO⁻). This creates a buffer solution containing both the weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻).\n\nThe Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used to find the pH of a buffer solution:\npH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\nwhere:\n*   [A⁻] is the concentration of the conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻)\n*   [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid (CH₃COOH)\n*   pKa = -log(Ka)\n\nAt 25% titration:\n*   75% of the original acid remains ([HA]).\n*   25% of the original acid has been converted to the conjugate base ([A⁻]).\n\nThe ratio [A⁻]/[HA] is therefore 25/75 = 1/3.\n\nNow, we calculate the pH:\n1.  Calculate pKa from the given Ka value (1.85 x 10⁻⁵):\n    pKa = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n2.  Substitute the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    pH = 4.73 + log(1/3)\n    pH = 4.73 - log(3)\n    pH = 4.73 - 0.477\n    pH ≈ 4.26\n\nSo, the pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n\n### **Step 3: pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been completely neutralized by the NaOH, and the only species influencing the pH (besides water) is the conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). The acetate ion hydrolyzes water, producing hydroxide ions (OH⁻), which makes the solution basic.\n\nCH₃COO⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ CH₃COOH(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n\nTo find the pH, we first need to calculate the concentration of the acetate ion at the equivalence point.\n\n1.  **Calculate initial moles of acetic acid:**\n    Moles HA = Concentration × Volume = 0.025 M × 0.040 L = 0.001 mol\n2.  **Calculate the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point:**\n    At equivalence, moles NaOH = moles HA = 0.001 mol.\n    Volume NaOH = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³\n3.  **Calculate the total volume and concentration of acetate at the equivalence point:**\n    Total Volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH added\n    Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n    Concentration of acetate [A⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n4.  **Calculate the pOH from the hydrolysis of the acetate ion:**\n    We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate.\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n    Using an ICE table for the hydrolysis reaction, we get:\n    Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻] ≈ [OH⁻]² / [A⁻]\n    [OH⁻]² = Kb × [A⁻] = (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) × (0.02) = 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    [OH⁻] = √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n5.  **Calculate pOH and then pH:**\n    pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52\n\nSo, the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated pH values are:\n*   At 25% titration: **4.26**\n*   At the equivalence point: **8.52**\n\nThese values correspond to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThe initial reasoning and the executed Python code both lead to the same result.\n\n1.  **pH at 25% Titration:**\n    *   The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used: `pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])`.\n    *   pKa = -log(1.85x10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73.\n    *   At 25% titration, the ratio of conjugate base [A⁻] to acid [HA] is 25/75, or 1/3.\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log(1/3) = 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.26.\n    *   The code output confirms: `pH at 25% titration: 4.26`.\n\n2.  **pH at the Equivalence Point:**\n    *   At this point, all the acid has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M in a total volume of 50.00 cm³.\n    *   The acetate hydrolyzes water, producing OH⁻. We need to calculate the pOH first using the Kb of acetate.\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = 1.0x10⁻¹⁴ / 1.85x10⁻⁵ ≈ 5.41x10⁻¹⁰.\n    *   [OH⁻] = sqrt(Kb * [CH₃COO⁻]) = sqrt(5.41x10⁻¹⁰ * 0.02) ≈ 3.29x10⁻⁶ M.\n    *   pOH = -log(3.29x10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48.\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52.\n    *   The code output confirms: `pH at equivalence point: 8.52`.\n\nThe calculated values are pH = 4.26 at 25% titration and pH = 8.52 at the equivalence point. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\n### Final Answer Rationale\n\n1.  **Initial Concentration:** The initial 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. The new volume is 40.00 cm³, and the new concentration is halved to 0.025 M.\n\n2.  **pH at 25% Titration:** At this point, the solution is a buffer. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used: pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]).\n    *   pKa = -log(1.85x10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n    *   At 25% titration, the ratio of conjugate base [A⁻] to acid [HA] is 25/75 or 1/3.\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log(1/3) = 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.257 ≈ **4.26**\n\n3.  **pH at Equivalence Point:** At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). We must calculate the concentration of this acetate solution and then find the pH resulting from its hydrolysis.\n    *   **Moles of acid:** 0.025 M × 0.040 L = 0.001 mol. This is also the moles of acetate formed.\n    *   **Volume of NaOH added:** 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³.\n    *   **Total volume:** 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n    *   **Concentration of acetate:** 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n    *   **Hydrolysis:** The acetate ion hydrolyzes: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻.

This creates a buffer solution containing both the weak acid (HAc) and its conjugate base (Ac⁻).\n\nThe Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used to find the pH of a buffer:\npH = pKa + log ( [Conjugate Base] / [Weak Acid] )\n\n1.  **Calculate pKa:**\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) = 4.733\n\n2.  **Determine the ratio of conjugate base to weak acid:**\n    *   At 25% titration, 25% of HAc is converted to Ac⁻, and 75% of HAc remains.\n    *   Ratio = [Ac⁻] / [HAc] = 25% / 75% = 1/3\n\n3.  **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.733 - 0.477\n    *   **pH ≈ 4.26**\n\n### **Part 3: pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been completely neutralized by NaOH. The solution now contains only the salt, sodium acetate (NaAc), dissolved in water. The acetate ion (Ac⁻) is a weak base and will hydrolyze water, making the solution basic.\n\n1.  **Calculate the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point:**\n    *   Moles of NaOH = Moles of HAc = 0.001 moles.\n    *   Volume of NaOH = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 moles / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³.\n\n2.  **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L.\n\n3.  **Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion ([Ac⁻]):**\n    *   Moles of Ac⁻ formed = Initial moles of HAc = 0.001 moles.\n    *   [Ac⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 moles / 0.0500 L = **0.02 M**.\n\n4.  **Consider the hydrolysis of acetate:**\n    *   Reaction: Ac⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ HAc(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate.\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) = 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰\n\n5.  **Calculate the hydroxide ion concentration [OH⁻]:**\n    *   We set up an equilibrium expression: Kb = [HAc][OH⁻] / [Ac⁻]\n    *   5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    *   Since Kb is very small, we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.\n    *   x² = (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02 = 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) = 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M\n\n6.  **Calculate pOH and then pH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) = 5.48\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = **8.52**\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe pH at 25% titration is **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.

This creates a buffer solution containing both the weak acid and its conjugate base.\n\n*   The reaction is: CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n*   At this point, the ratio of the concentration of the conjugate base to the weak acid is [CH₃COO⁻]/[CH₃COOH] = 25/75 = 1/3.\n\nWe can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH of this buffer:\npH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n\n*   Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n*   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n\n**3. Calculate the pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been completely neutralized by the NaOH. The solution now contains only the salt, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa), which dissociates into Na⁺ and the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻). The acetate ion is a weak base and will hydrolyze water, making the solution basic.\n\n*   **Step a: Find the moles of acid.**\n    Moles of CH₃COOH = Molarity × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.040 L = 0.001 mol.\n\n*   **Step b: Find the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point.**\n    At equivalence, moles of NaOH = moles of CH₃COOH = 0.001 mol.\n    Volume of NaOH = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³.\n\n*   **Step c: Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) at the equivalence point.**\n    Total Volume = Volume of acid solution + Volume of NaOH added = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n    Concentration of CH₃COO⁻ = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n\n*   **Step d: Calculate the pH from the hydrolysis of the acetate ion.**\n    The hydrolysis reaction is: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n    We need the base dissociation constant (Kb) for the acetate ion.\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n    Now, we set up an ICE table for the hydrolysis, where x = [OH⁻]:\n    Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    Since Kb is very small, we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.\n    5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = x² / 0.02\n    x² = (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02 = 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    x = [OH⁻] = √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n\n*   **Step e: Calculate pOH and then pH.**\n    pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52\n\nThe pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\nThe calculated values are pH ≈ 4.26 at 25% titration and pH ≈ 8.52 at the equivalence point. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning for solving the problem:\n\n### **Part 1: Dilution of Acetic Acid**\n\nFirst, we need to determine the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted. The initial solution is 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and it's diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water.\n\n*   **Initial Volume (V₁):** 20.00 cm³\n*   **Initial Concentration (M₁):** 0.05 M\n*   **Final Volume (V₂):** 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   **Final Concentration (M₂):** ?\n\nWe use the dilution formula **M₁V₁ = M₂V₂**:\n(0.05 M) × (20.00 cm³) = M₂ × (40.00 cm³)\nM₂ = (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³\n**M₂ = 0.025 M**\n\nSo, the titration is performed on a 40.00 cm³ solution of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n### **Part 2: pH at 25% Titration**\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (CH₃COOH) has reacted with the NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), while 75% of the acetic acid remains unreacted. This creates a buffer solution.\n\nThe reaction is: **CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O**\n\nWe can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH of this buffer:\n**pH = pKa + log ( [A⁻] / [HA] )**\n\n1.  **Calculate pKa:**\n    *   Given Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n    *   pKa = -log₁₀(Ka) = -log₁₀(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n\n2.  **Determine the ratio [A⁻] / [HA]:**\n    *   [A⁻] corresponds to the 25% that has reacted.\n    *   [HA] corresponds to the 75% that remains.\n    *   The ratio is 25 / 75 = 1/3.\n\n3.  **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   pH = pKa + log(1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log(0.333...)\n    *   pH = 4.73 - 0.477\n    *   **pH ≈ 4.26**\n\n### **Part 3: pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the initial acetic acid has been completely neutralized by the NaOH, forming acetate ions (CH₃COO⁻) in the solution.\n\n1.  **Calculate initial moles of acetic acid:**\n    *   Moles = Concentration × Volume\n    *   Moles of CH₃COOH = 0.025 mol/L × (40.00 cm³ / 1000 cm³/L) = 0.001 mol\n\n2.  **Determine the volume of NaOH added:**\n    *   At equivalence, moles of NaOH = moles of CH₃COOH = 0.001 mol.\n    *   Volume NaOH = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³\n\n3.  **Calculate the total volume and concentration of acetate:**\n    *   Total Volume = Initial volume of acid solution + Volume of NaOH added\n    *   Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n    *   The moles of acetate formed are equal to the initial moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001 mol.\n    *   Concentration of acetate [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = **0.02 M**\n\n4.  **Calculate the pH of the acetate solution:**\n    *   Acetate is a weak base and hydrolyzes in water: **CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻**\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb. We can find it from Ka using the ion product of water (Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C).\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n    *   We set up an equilibrium expression: Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    *   Let x = [OH⁻]. Then: 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x). Assuming x is very small compared to 0.02, we get:\n    *   x² ≈ (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 ≈ 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] ≈ √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n\n5.  **Calculate pOH and then pH:**\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14.00 - 5.48 = **8.52**\n\nThe calculated values are pH ≈ 4.26 at 25% titration and pH ≈ 8.52 at the equivalence point. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\n**Detailed Step-by-Step Derivation:**\n\n**1. Calculate the Concentration of Acetic Acid After Dilution**\n\n*   **Initial state:** We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n*   **Dilution:** We add 20.00 cm³ of water.\n*   **Final volume (V₂):** 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³\n*   **Use the dilution formula (M₁V₁ = M₂V₂):**\n    *   M₁ = 0.05 M\n    *   V₁ = 20.00 cm³\n    *   V₂ = 40.00 cm³\n    *   M₂ = (M₁V₁) / V₂ = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = **0.025 M**\n*   So, the solution being titrated is 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n**2. Calculate the pH at 25% Titration**\n\n*   At any point during the titration before the equivalence point, we have a buffer solution containing both acetic acid (HA) and its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻).\n*   The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used for buffer pH calculations:\n    **pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])**\n*   **Calculate pKa:**\n    *   Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n    *   pKa = -log₁₀(Ka) = -log₁₀(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n*   **Determine the ratio of [A⁻]/[HA]:**\n    *   At 25% titration, 25% of the original acid (HA) has been converted into its conjugate base (A⁻), and 75% of the acid remains.\n    *   The ratio [A⁻]/[HA] is 25/75, which simplifies to 1/3.\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log₁₀(1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.73 - log₁₀(3)\n    *   pH = 4.73 - 0.477\n    *   **pH ≈ 4.26**\n\n**3. Calculate the pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n*   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH to form sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The solution now contains only the conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), which hydrolyzes water.\n    **CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻**\n*   **Step 3.1: Find the moles of acid and the volume of NaOH needed.**\n    *   Moles of acid = Concentration × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.0400 L = 0.001 mol\n    *   At equivalence, moles of NaOH = moles of acid = 0.001 mol.\n    *   Volume of NaOH added = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n*   **Step 3.2: Find the concentration of acetate ([A⁻]) at the equivalence point.**\n    *   Total volume = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n    *   Concentration of acetate = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = **0.02 M**\n*   **Step 3.3: Calculate the [OH⁻] from the hydrolysis reaction.**\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate: Kb = Kw / Ka\n    *   Kb = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n    *   For the hydrolysis equilibrium, Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]. Let x = [OH⁻].\n    *   5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02)\n    *   x² = (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02 = 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n*   **Step 3.4: Calculate pOH and then pH.**\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.48 = **8.52**\n\nThe calculated pH at 25% titration is **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis problem requires calculating the pH at two specific points during the titration of acetic acid with NaOH: at 25% of the way to the equivalence point and at the equivalence point itself.\n\n### **Step 1: Dilution of Acetic Acid**\n\nFirst, we calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted with water.\n*   Initial volume of acetic acid (V1) = 20.00 cm³\n*   Initial concentration of acetic acid (M1) = 0.05 M\n*   Final volume after adding water (V2) = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³\n*   Using the dilution formula M1V1 = M2V2, we can find the new concentration (M2):\n    M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2 = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M\n    So, the concentration of the acetic acid (CH₃COOH) to be titrated is **0.025 M**.\n\n### **Step 2: pH at 25% Titration**\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH to form its conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH₃COO⁻). This creates a buffer solution containing both the weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻).\n\nThe Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used to find the pH of a buffer solution:\npH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\nwhere:\n*   [A⁻] is the concentration of the conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻)\n*   [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid (CH₃COOH)\n*   pKa = -log(Ka)\n\nAt 25% titration:\n*   75% of the original acid remains ([HA]).\n*   25% of the original acid has been converted to the conjugate base ([A⁻]).\n\nThe ratio [A⁻]/[HA] is therefore 25/75 = 1/3.\n\nNow, we calculate the pH:\n1.  Calculate pKa from the given Ka value (1.85 x 10⁻⁵):\n    pKa = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n2.  Substitute the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    pH = 4.73 + log(1/3)\n    pH = 4.73 - log(3)\n    pH = 4.73 - 0.477\n    pH ≈ 4.26\n\nSo, the pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n\n### **Step 3: pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been completely neutralized by the NaOH, and the only species influencing the pH (besides water) is the conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). The acetate ion hydrolyzes water, producing hydroxide ions (OH⁻), which makes the solution basic.\n\nCH₃COO⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ CH₃COOH(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n\nTo find the pH, we first need to calculate the concentration of the acetate ion at the equivalence point.\n\n1.  **Calculate initial moles of acetic acid:**\n    Moles HA = Concentration × Volume = 0.025 M × 0.040 L = 0.001 mol\n2.  **Calculate the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point:**\n    At equivalence, moles NaOH = moles HA = 0.001 mol.\n    Volume NaOH = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³\n3.  **Calculate the total volume and concentration of acetate at the equivalence point:**\n    Total Volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH added\n    Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n    Concentration of acetate [A⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n4.  **Calculate the pOH from the hydrolysis of the acetate ion:**\n    We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate.\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n    Using an ICE table for the hydrolysis reaction, we get:\n    Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻] ≈ [OH⁻]² / [A⁻]\n    [OH⁻]² = Kb × [A⁻] = (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) × (0.02) = 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    [OH⁻] = √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n5.  **Calculate pOH and then pH:**\n    pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52\n\nSo, the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated pH values are:\n*   At 25% titration: **4.26**\n*   At the equivalence point: **8.52**\n\nThese values correspond to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThe initial reasoning and the executed Python code both lead to the same result.\n\n1.  **pH at 25% Titration:**\n    *   The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used: `pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])`.\n    *   pKa = -log(1.85x10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73.\n    *   At 25% titration, the ratio of conjugate base [A⁻] to acid [HA] is 25/75, or 1/3.\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log(1/3) = 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.26.\n    *   The code output confirms: `pH at 25% titration: 4.26`.\n\n2.  **pH at the Equivalence Point:**\n    *   At this point, all the acid has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻).

The new volume is 40.00 cm³, and the new concentration is halved to 0.025 M.\n\n2.  **pH at 25% Titration:** At this point, the solution is a buffer. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used: pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]).\n    *   pKa = -log(1.85x10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n    *   At 25% titration, the ratio of conjugate base [A⁻] to acid [HA] is 25/75 or 1/3.\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log(1/3) = 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.257 ≈ **4.26**\n\n3.  **pH at Equivalence Point:** At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). We must calculate the concentration of this acetate solution and then find the pH resulting from its hydrolysis.\n    *   **Moles of acid:** 0.025 M × 0.040 L = 0.001 mol. This is also the moles of acetate formed.\n    *   **Volume of NaOH added:** 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³.\n    *   **Total volume:** 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n    *   **Concentration of acetate:** 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n    *   **Hydrolysis:** The acetate ion hydrolyzes: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻. We need Kb for acetate.\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0x10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85x10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41x10⁻¹⁰.\n    *   **[OH⁻]:** [OH⁻] = √(Kb × [CH₃COO⁻]) = √(5.41x10⁻¹⁰ × 0.02) ≈ 3.29x10⁻⁶ M.\n    *   **pOH:** -log(3.29x10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48.\n    *   **pH:** 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = **8.52**.\n\nThe calculated values are pH = 4.26 at 25% titration and pH = 8.52 at the equivalence point. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is the step-by-step solution based on the calculations:\n\n**Part 1: pH at 25% Titration**\n\n1.  **Dilution:** The initial 0.001 moles of acetic acid (0.05 M * 0.020 L) are diluted into a new volume of 40.00 cm³ (0.040 L). The new concentration is 0.025 M, but for this part, only the mole ratio matters.\n2.  **Buffer Formation:** At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (HA) has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻), by the NaOH. This creates a buffer solution where the ratio of [A⁻] to [HA] is 25:75 or 1:3.\n3.  **Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation:** We use this equation to find the pH of the buffer:\n    pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n    *   First, calculate the pKa:\n        pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n    *   Now, plug in the values:\n        pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n        pH = 4.733 - 0.477\n        pH ≈ 4.256\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH is **4.26**.\n\n**Part 2: pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n1.  **Equivalence Point Conditions:** At this point, all 0.001 moles of acetic acid have been neutralized by an equal number of moles of NaOH.

This creates a buffer solution containing both the weak acid (HAc) and its conjugate base (Ac⁻).\n\nThe Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used to find the pH of a buffer:\npH = pKa + log ( [Conjugate Base] / [Weak Acid] )\n\n1.  **Calculate pKa:**\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) = 4.733\n\n2.  **Determine the ratio of conjugate base to weak acid:**\n    *   At 25% titration, 25% of HAc is converted to Ac⁻, and 75% of HAc remains.\n    *   Ratio = [Ac⁻] / [HAc] = 25% / 75% = 1/3\n\n3.  **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.733 - 0.477\n    *   **pH ≈ 4.26**\n\n### **Part 3: pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been completely neutralized by NaOH. The solution now contains only the salt, sodium acetate (NaAc), dissolved in water. The acetate ion (Ac⁻) is a weak base and will hydrolyze water, making the solution basic.\n\n1.  **Calculate the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point:**\n    *   Moles of NaOH = Moles of HAc = 0.001 moles.\n    *   Volume of NaOH = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 moles / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³.\n\n2.  **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L.\n\n3.  **Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion ([Ac⁻]):**\n    *   Moles of Ac⁻ formed = Initial moles of HAc = 0.001 moles.\n    *   [Ac⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 moles / 0.0500 L = **0.02 M**.\n\n4.  **Consider the hydrolysis of acetate:**\n    *   Reaction: Ac⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ HAc(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate.\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) = 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰\n\n5.  **Calculate the hydroxide ion concentration [OH⁻]:**\n    *   We set up an equilibrium expression: Kb = [HAc][OH⁻] / [Ac⁻]\n    *   5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    *   Since Kb is very small, we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.\n    *   x² = (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02 = 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) = 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M\n\n6.  **Calculate pOH and then pH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) = 5.48\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = **8.52**\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe pH at 25% titration is **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.
