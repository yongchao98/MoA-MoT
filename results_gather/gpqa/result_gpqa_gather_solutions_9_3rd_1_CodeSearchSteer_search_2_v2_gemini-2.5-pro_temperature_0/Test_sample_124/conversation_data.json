As unanimously identified by all candidate answers, this is the potential for a three-dimensional (3D) isotropic harmonic oscillator. The term \"isotropic\" means the potential is spherically symmetric, and the angular frequency $\\omega$ is the same for oscillations along all three Cartesian axes.\n\n2.  **Determine the Energy Eigenvalues:** The Schrödinger equation for this system is separable in Cartesian coordinates ($x, y, z$). The total energy is the sum of three independent one-dimensional (1D) harmonic oscillator energies.\n    *   The energy for a 1D harmonic oscillator is $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$ is the quantum number for that dimension.\n    *   The total energy for the 3D system is the sum:\n        $E = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   By defining a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$ (where $n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$), the energy levels are given by the formula:\n        $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$.\n    This formula is correctly derived by all candidate answers.\n\n3.  **Find the Energy of the Third Excited State:** The energy levels are indexed by the principal quantum number $n$, starting from the ground state at $n=0$.\n    *   **Ground State:** $n=0 \\implies E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **First Excited State:** $n=1 \\implies E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Second Excited State:** $n=2 \\implies E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Third Excited State:** $n=3 \\implies E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    All candidate answers correctly calculate the energy of the third excited state to be $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Degeneracy:** The degeneracy of an energy level is the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions that share the same energy. This is equivalent to finding the number of different combinations of non-negative integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to the principal quantum number $n$. For the third excited state, we need to find the number of combinations where $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$.\n    *   The general formula for the degeneracy $g_n$ of the n-th level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is:\n        $g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$.\n    *   For the third excited state ($n=3$):\n        $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n    *   This can be verified by explicitly listing the combinations, as shown by many of the candidate answers:\n        *   Permutations of (3, 0, 0): 3 states\n        *   Permutations of (2, 1, 0): 6 states\n        *   The combination (1, 1, 1): 1 state\n        *   Total degeneracy = 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.\n    All candidate answers correctly calculate the degeneracy to be 10.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **System Identification:** The potential $V \\propto r^2$ is for a harmonic oscillator. The energy expressions in options B and D, which are proportional to $1/r^2$, are characteristic of an infinite spherical well and are incorrect for this problem.\n*   **State Indexing:** The ground state is $n=0$. Therefore, the \"third excited state\" corresponds to $n=3$. This is a common point of error, but all candidate answers handled it correctly.\n*   **Degeneracy Calculation:** The degeneracy for $n=3$ is 10. Option C incorrectly lists the degeneracy as 3 (which is the degeneracy for the first excited state, $n=1$).\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBased on the unanimous and correct reasoning presented across all candidate answers, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$ and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy) is 10.\n\nComparing this result with the provided options:\n*   **A) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10** - This matches our derived energy and degeneracy.\n*   B) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10 - Incorrect energy.\n*   C) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3 - Incorrect degeneracy.\n*   D) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3 - Incorrect energy and degeneracy.\n\nThe correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided answers and a first-principles derivation, here is the definitive solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical System:** The potential given is $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$.

This is equivalent to finding the number of different combinations of non-negative integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to the principal quantum number $n=3$.\n    *   The general formula for the degeneracy $g_n$ of the n-th level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is:\n        $g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n    *   For the third excited state ($n=3$):\n        $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n    *   This can be verified by explicitly listing the combinations:\n        *   Permutations of (3, 0, 0): 3 states\n        *   Permutations of (2, 1, 0): 6 states\n        *   The combination (1, 1, 1): 1 state\n        *   Total degeneracy = 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **System Identification:** The potential $V \\propto r^2$ is the signature of a harmonic oscillator. The energy expressions in options C and D, which are proportional to $1/r^2$, are characteristic of an infinite spherical well and are incorrect for this system.\n*   **State Indexing:** The ground state is $n=0$. Therefore, the \"third excited state\" corresponds to $n=3$. This is a common point of error, but all candidate answers handled it correctly.\n*   **Degeneracy Calculation:** The degeneracy for the $n=3$ state is 10. Option A incorrectly lists the degeneracy as 3 (which is the degeneracy for the first excited state, $n=1$).\n*   **Consistency of Candidate Answers:** All 15 candidate answers correctly derive the energy as $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$ and the degeneracy as 10.

The energy expressions in options C and D, which are proportional to $1/r^2$, are characteristic of an infinite spherical well and are incorrect for this system.\n*   **State Indexing:** The ground state is $n=0$. Therefore, the \"third excited state\" corresponds to $n=3$. This is a common point of error, but all candidate answers handled it correctly.\n*   **Degeneracy Calculation:** The degeneracy for the $n=3$ state is 10. Option A incorrectly lists the degeneracy as 3 (which is the degeneracy for the first excited state, $n=1$).\n*   **Consistency of Candidate Answers:** All 15 candidate answers correctly derive the energy as $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$ and the degeneracy as 10.
