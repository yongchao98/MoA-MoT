Analyze the Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene is a *trans*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reaction:** The two-step process of mCPBA followed by aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) is a standard method for the *anti*-dihydroxylation of an alkene. This means two hydroxyl (-OH) groups are added across the double bond, one from the top face and one from the bottom face.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** A well-established rule in stereochemistry is that an **anti-addition** to a **trans-alkene** results in a **meso compound**. A meso compound is a single, achiral molecule that contains stereocenters but is superimposable on its mirror image due to an internal element of symmetry.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single product, **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is a *cis*-alkene. It is also an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction is the same *anti*-dihydroxylation as in Reaction 1.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The corresponding stereochemical rule is that an **anti-addition** to a **cis-alkene** results in a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers. A racemic mixture contains equal amounts of two molecules that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A 1:1 mixture of two enantiomers: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe stereochemical relationships between these molecules are key:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso isomer is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers.\n\n### **4. Predict the Chromatographic Results**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity).\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated by a standard HPLC column and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated.\n    *   In the mixture, the meso-diol (a diastereomer) will be separated from the enantiomeric pair. The two enantiomers will co-elute.\n    *   **Result:** **2 peaks** will be observed. (Peak 1: meso-diol; Peak 2: the co-eluting enantiomers).\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n    *   The chiral column will separate the two enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, into two distinct peaks.\n    *   The meso-diol, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also be separated and will appear as its own peak.\n    *   **Result:** **3 peaks** will be observed, one for each of the three stereoisomers in the mixture.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe **2 peaks in the standard HPLC** and **3 peaks in the chiral HPLC**. Matching this result to the given options:\n\nA) 3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC\nB) 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC\nC) 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC\nD) 4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Analyze Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene is a *trans*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reaction:** The two-step process of treatment with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) results in the *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene. This means two hydroxyl (-OH) groups are added across the double bond, one from the top face and one from the bottom face.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** A fundamental rule in stereochemistry is that the *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene yields a **meso compound**. A meso compound is a single, achiral molecule that contains stereocenters but is superimposable on its mirror image due to an internal element of symmetry.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single product, **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **2. Analyze Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is a *cis*-alkene. It is also an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reaction:** The same *anti*-dihydroxylation reaction is performed.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The corresponding stereochemical rule is that an *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene yields a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers. A racemic mixture contains equal amounts of two molecules that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A 50:50 mixture of two enantiomers: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture therefore contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationships between these isomers are key:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols.\n\n### **4. Predict the Chromatographic Results**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They cannot be separated by a standard HPLC column and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated.\n    *   Therefore, the mixture will show **2 peaks**: one peak for the meso-diol, and a second peak for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair ((4R,5R) + (4S,5S)).\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n    *   The chiral column will resolve the two enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, into two separate peaks.\n    *   The meso-diol, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also be separated and will appear as its own distinct peak.\n    *   Therefore, the mixture will show **3 peaks**: one for the meso-diol, one for the (4R,5R)-diol, and one for the (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe **2 peaks in the standard HPLC** and **3 peaks in the chiral HPLC**.

A meso compound is a single, achiral molecule that has stereocenters but is superimposable on its mirror image due to internal symmetry.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** This reaction produces a single product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Product of Reaction 2**\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is a *cis*-alkene.\n*   **Reaction:** The same *anti*-dihydroxylation reaction is performed.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The corresponding rule is that an *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene results in a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers. A racemic mixture contains equal amounts of two molecules that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** This reaction produces a 50:50 mixture of two enantiomers: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture therefore contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationships between these isomers are critical for predicting the chromatography results:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the Chromatographic Observations**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated by a standard HPLC column and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated.\n    *   In the mixture, the meso-diol will be separated from the enantiomeric pair. The two enantiomers will co-elute.\n    *   **Result:** **2 peaks** will be observed (one for the meso compound, and one for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair).\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n    *   The chiral column will separate the two enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, into two distinct peaks.\n    *   The meso-diol, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also be separated and will appear as its own peak.\n    *   **Result:** All three stereoisomers will be resolved, and **3 peaks** will be observed.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe **2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC**. Matching this result to the provided options:\n\nA) 3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC\nB) 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC\nC) 4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC\nD) 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, synthesizing the correct reasoning found across all candidate answers.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Product of Reaction 1**\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene is a *trans*-alkene.

A racemic mixture contains equal amounts of two molecules that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The reaction produces a 1:1 mixture of two enantiomers: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions.
