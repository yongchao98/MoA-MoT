    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Initial State and the Hamiltonian\n\n*   **Particle and Magnetic Moment:** We have a spin-1/2 particle. Its magnetic moment operator is given by $\\vec{\\mu} = \\gamma \\vec{S}$, where $\\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ratio and $\\vec{S}$ is the spin angular momentum operator.\n*   **Initial State (t < 0):** The particle is aligned with a magnetic field $\\vec{B}_0 = B \\hat{z}$ (pointing in the +Z direction). \"Aligned\" means the system is in the lowest energy eigenstate of the initial Hamiltonian $H_0 = -\\vec{\\mu} \\cdot \\vec{B}_0 = -\\gamma S_z B$.\n    *   The energy eigenstates of $S_z$ are \"spin up\" ($|+\\rangle_z$) and \"spin down\" ($|-\\rangle_z$) with eigenvalues $+\\hbar/2$ and $-\\hbar/2$, respectively.\n    *   The corresponding energies are $E = -\\gamma B (\\pm \\hbar/2)$.\n    *   If $\\gamma > 0$ (like for a proton), the lowest energy state is the one with the most positive $m_s$, i.e., $|+\\rangle_z$. If $\\gamma < 0$ (like for an electron), the lowest energy state is $|-\\rangle_z$. The phrase \"aligned with\" usually implies the spin projection is along the field, which corresponds to the $|+\\rangle_z$ state. Let's assume the initial state is $|\\psi(0)\\rangle = |+\\rangle_z$. We will see later that the result for the frequency is the same if we start from $|-\\rangle_z$.\n*   **New Hamiltonian (t > 0):** The magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction, $\\vec{B} = B \\hat{y}$. The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution of the system is $H = -\\vec{\\mu} \\cdot \\vec{B} = -\\gamma B S_y$.\n\n### 2. Time Evolution of the System\n\nWe need to find the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, $\\langle \\mu_z(t) \\rangle$, as a function of time. This is given by $\\langle \\mu_z(t) \\rangle = \\langle \\psi(t) | \\mu_z | \\psi(t) \\rangle$. We have $\\mu_z = \\gamma S_z$. The state evolves according to the Schrödinger equation: $|\\psi(t)\\rangle = e^{-iHt/\\hbar} |\\psi(0)\\rangle$.\n\nThere are several ways to solve this problem.\n\n#### Method 1: Schrödinger Picture\n\n1.  **Express the initial state in the energy basis of the new Hamiltonian.**\n    The new Hamiltonian is $H = -\\gamma B S_y$. Its eigenstates are the eigenstates of $S_y$, which we'll denote as $|+\\rangle_y$ and $|-\\rangle_y$. In the standard $S_z$ basis where $|+\\rangle_z = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $|-\\rangle_z = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, the $S_y$ eigenstates are:\n    *   $|+\\rangle_y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (|+\\rangle_z + i |-\\rangle_z)$\n    *   $|-\\rangle_y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (|+\\rangle_z - i |-\\rangle_z)$\n    We can express our initial state $|\\psi(0)\\rangle = |+\\rangle_z$ in this new basis:\n    $|+\\rangle_z = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (|+\\rangle_y + |-\\rangle_y)$.\n\n2.  **Evolve the state in time.**\n    The energy eigenvalues for the states $|+\\rangle_y$ and $|-\\rangle_y$ are $E_+ = -\\gamma B (\\hbar/2)$ and $E_- = -\\gamma B (-\\hbar/2) = +\\gamma B (\\hbar/2)$.\n    The state at time $t$ is:\n    $|\\psi(t)\\rangle = e^{-iHt/\\hbar} |\\psi(0)\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (e^{-iE_+ t/\\hbar} |+\\rangle_y + e^{-iE_- t/\\hbar} |-\\rangle_y)$\n    $|\\psi(t)\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (e^{i\\gamma B t/2} |+\\rangle_y + e^{-i\\gamma B t/2} |-\\rangle_y)$\n\n3.  **Calculate the expectation value $\\langle S_z(t) \\rangle$.**\n    Let's convert $|\\psi(t)\\rangle$ back to the $S_z$ basis for easier calculation. Let $\\omega_L = \\gamma B$.\n    $|\\psi(t)\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} [e^{i\\omega_L t/2} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|+\\rangle_z + i|-\\rangle_z) + e^{-i\\omega_L t/2} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|+\\rangle_z - i|-\\rangle_z)]$\n    $|\\psi(t)\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} [(e^{i\\omega_L t/2} + e^{-i\\omega_L t/2})|+\\rangle_z + i(e^{i\\omega_L t/2} - e^{-i\\omega_L t/2})|-\\rangle_z]$\n    Using Euler's formulas, $\\cos x = (e^{ix} + e^{-ix})/2$ and $\\sin x = (e^{ix} - e^{-ix})/2i$:\n    $|\\psi(t)\\rangle = \\cos(\\omega_L t/2) |+\\rangle_z - \\sin(\\omega_L t/2) |-\\rangle_z$\n    Now we calculate the expectation value:\n    $\\langle S_z(t) \\rangle = \\langle\\psi(t)| S_z |\\psi(t)\\rangle$\n    $= (\\cos(\\frac{\\omega_L t}{2}) \\langle+|_z - \\sin(\\frac{\\omega_L t}{2}) \\langle-|_z) S_z (\\cos(\\frac{\\omega_L t}{2}) |+\\rangle_z - \\sin(\\frac{\\omega_L t}{2}) |-\\rangle_z)$\n    $= \\cos^2(\\frac{\\omega_L t}{2}) \\langle+|_z|S_z|+\\rangle_z - \\sin^2(\\frac{\\omega_L t}{2}) \\langle-|_z|S_z|-\\rangle_z$\n    $= \\cos^2(\\frac{\\omega_L t}{2}) (\\frac{\\hbar}{2}) - \\sin^2(\\frac{\\omega_L t}{2}) (-\\frac{\\hbar}{2})$\n    $= \\frac{\\hbar}{2} (\\cos^2(\\frac{\\omega_L t}{2}) - \\sin^2(\\frac{\\omega_L t}{2}))$\n    Using the double-angle identity $\\cos(2\\theta) = \\cos^2\\theta - \\sin^2\\theta$:\n    $\\langle S_z(t) \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\omega_L t)$\n\n4.  **Find the oscillation frequency.**\n    The average z-component of the magnetic moment is $\\langle \\mu_z(t) \\rangle = \\gamma \\langle S_z(t) \\rangle = \\frac{\\gamma\\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\omega_L t)$.\n    Substituting $\\omega_L = \\gamma B$, we get:\n    $\\langle \\mu_z(t) \\rangle = \\frac{\\gamma\\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t)$.\n    The oscillation is described by the term $\\cos(\\gamma B t)$. The angular frequency of this oscillation is the coefficient of $t$, which is $\\omega = \\gamma B$.\n\n#### Method 2: Ehrenfest's Theorem / Classical Analogy\n\nThe time evolution of the expectation value of an operator follows a classical-like equation of motion. For spin in a magnetic field, the torque equation is $\\vec{\\tau} = \\frac{d\\vec{S}}{dt} = \\vec{\\mu} \\times \\vec{B}$.\nUsing $\\vec{\\mu} = \\gamma\\vec{S}$, we get $\\frac{d\\vec{S}}{dt} = \\gamma\\vec{S} \\times \\vec{B}$.\nThis equation also holds for the expectation values:\n$\\frac{d\\langle\\vec{S}\\rangle}{dt} = \\gamma \\langle\\vec{S}\\rangle \\times \\vec{B}$\nHere, $\\vec{B} = (0, B, 0)$. Let $\\langle\\vec{S}\\rangle = (\\langle S_x \\rangle, \\langle S_y \\rangle, \\langle S_z \\rangle)$. The components of the cross product give:\n*   $\\frac{d\\langle S_x \\rangle}{dt} = \\gamma(\\langle S_y \\rangle B_z - \\langle S_z \\rangle B_y) = -\\gamma B \\langle S_z \\rangle$\n*   $\\frac{d\\langle S_y \\rangle}{dt} = \\gamma(\\langle S_z \\rangle B_x - \\langle S_x \\rangle B_z) = 0$\n*   $\\frac{d\\langle S_z \\rangle}{dt} = \\gamma(\\langle S_x \\rangle B_y - \\langle S_y \\rangle B_x) = \\gamma B \\langle S_x \\rangle$\n\nWe have a system of coupled differential equations. Differentiating the third equation with respect to time and substituting the first one:\n$\\frac{d^2\\langle S_z \\rangle}{dt^2} = \\gamma B \\frac{d\\langle S_x \\rangle}{dt} = \\gamma B (-\\gamma B \\langle S_z \\rangle) = -(\\gamma B)^2 \\langle S_z \\rangle$.\nThis is the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator, $\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = -\\omega^2 x$. The angular frequency of oscillation is $\\omega = \\gamma B$.\nThis phenomenon is known as Larmor precession, and the frequency $\\omega_L = \\gamma B$ is the Larmor frequency.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth methods robustly show that the expectation value of the z-component of the spin, and thus the z-component of the magnetic moment, oscillates with an angular frequency of $\\omega = \\gamma B$. Comparing this result with the given options:\n\n*   A) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\n*   B) gamma*B/2\n*   C) gamma*B\n*   D) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
