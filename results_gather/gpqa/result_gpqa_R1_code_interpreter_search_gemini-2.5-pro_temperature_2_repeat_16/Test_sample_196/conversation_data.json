  "response_list": [
    "*   **Step 1: Elucidate the structure of Compound X from the given spectroscopic data.**\n\n    *   **IR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n        *   A very broad absorption in the range of 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretch of a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid.\n        *   A strong absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n        *   Absorptions at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ suggest the presence of C=C stretching from an aromatic ring.\n        *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet integrating to one proton, found far downfield. This signal is characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets, each integrating to two protons, are in the aromatic region. This A2B2 splitting pattern is indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The doublet at 8.0 ppm is downfield, indicating these protons are adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group. The doublet at 7.2 ppm is upfield, suggesting these protons are adjacent to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n        *   **Alkyl Region Analysis:** We need to piece together the structure of the alkyl group from the remaining signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for a -CH₂- group. Combining with the triplet, this suggests an ethyl fragment (-CH₂CH₃). This CH₂ group is coupled to the CH₃ (3H) and another proton (1H), hence it appears as a multiplet.\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-).\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for a -CH- group. The chemical shift of ~2.9 ppm suggests it is a benzylic proton (i.e., attached directly to the benzene ring). This methine proton is coupled to the adjacent -CH₃ (3H) and the -CH₂- (2H) group. This complex coupling (5 neighboring protons) explains why it appears as a multiplet.\n            *   **Assembling the alkyl group:** Connecting these pieces gives `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃`, which is a **sec-butyl group**.\n    *   **Conclusion for Compound X:** Combining all the information, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the product of the reaction.**\n\n    *   **Reaction:** Compound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) is treated with red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    *   **Reagent Function:** The combination of red phosphorus and HI is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce carboxylic acids completely to the corresponding alkanes (i.e., -COOH is reduced to -CH₃).\n    *   **Applying the reaction:** The carboxylic acid group on 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid will be reduced to a methyl group. The sec-butyl group and the aromatic ring will remain unchanged under these conditions.\n\n        `4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid  ---(Red P, HI)-->  1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene`\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify the final product from the given options.**\n\n    *   The calculated product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n    *   Comparing this with the given options:\n        *   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (This is the starting material)\n        *   B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene (Incorrect alkyl group)\n        *   C) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid (Incorrect structure)\n        *   D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene (This matches our derived product)\n\n<<<D>>>"
