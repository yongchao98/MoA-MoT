    "Here's a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given compounds show optical isomerism.\n\n**Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Common features that lead to chirality are the presence of a chiral center or axial/planar chirality (like in atropisomers) and the absence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nLet's examine each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl system where the two phenyl rings are joined by a single C-C bond. The positions ortho to this bond (2, 2', 6, 6') are all substituted with bulky groups: two dimethyl carboxylate (-COOCH3) groups and two nitro (-NO2) groups.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** Due to the large size of the substituents at the ortho positions, the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is severely restricted. This forces the rings to adopt a twisted, non-planar conformation. This phenomenon is known as atropisomerism.\n    *   **Symmetry:** In this twisted conformation, the molecule lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Because it is not superimposable on its mirror image, the molecule is chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** Also known as methyl lactate, its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** We look for a chiral center, which is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Let's examine the second carbon atom (C2):\n        *   Group 1: A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        *   Group 2: A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        *   Group 3: A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        *   Group 4: A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since C2 is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center.\n    *   **Conclusion:** A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** This is diphenyl ketone, (C₆H₅)₂C=O. It consists of a carbonyl group bonded to two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule has no chiral centers. The central carbon is sp² hybridized. Let's check for elements of symmetry. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral. It is superimposable on its mirror image and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. Its structure is a planar alkene with methoxycarbonyl (-COOCH₃) groups on opposite sides of the double bond.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is planar. It has no chiral centers. It possesses a center of inversion (a point of symmetry in the middle of the C=C bond) and also a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism. It shows geometric (cis/trans) isomerism, but not optical isomerism.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (atropisomerism).\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral center).\n*   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n*   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nThe compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
