    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction 1**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a symmetrical *trans*-alkene.\n    ```\n          H       H\n           \\     /\n            C = C\n           /     \\\n    CH3CH2CH2    CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n\n2.  **Reagents and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **mCPBA (meta-Chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs epoxidation, which is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n    *   **Aqueous acid (H3O+):** This catalyzes the ring-opening of the epoxide by water. This is an *anti*-addition of two hydroxyl (-OH) groups. The overall reaction (mCPBA followed by H3O+) is an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:**\n    There's a well-established stereochemistry rule for addition reactions: **Trans + Anti = Meso**.\n    *   Starting with a *trans*-alkene, an *anti*-addition reaction will produce a *meso* compound (if the alkene is symmetrically substituted, which oct-4-ene is).\n    *   A meso compound is a single, achiral molecule that contains stereocenters but has an internal plane of symmetry.\n    *   Let's follow the mechanism to confirm:\n        *   **Step 1 (Epoxidation):** (E)-oct-4-ene (trans) undergoes *syn*-addition with mCPBA. This forms a racemic mixture of *trans*-epoxides: (4R,5R)-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-epoxyoctane.\n        *   **Step 2 (Ring Opening):** The acid-catalyzed opening of an epoxide by water is an Sâ‚™2-like reaction, involving a backside attack (anti-addition).\n            *   Reacting the (4R,5R)-epoxide via anti-attack produces the (4R,5S)-diol.\n            *   Reacting the (4S,5S)-epoxide via anti-attack also produces the (4R,5S)-diol.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction 1 yields a single product: the meso-diol, **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. Let's call this compound **M**.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction 2**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a symmetrical *cis*-alkene.\n    ```\n    CH3CH2CH2       CH2CH2CH3\n             \\     /\n              C = C\n             /     \\\n            H       H\n    ```\n2.  **Reagents and Reaction Type:** The reaction is the same: *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:**\n    The stereochemistry rule for this case is: **Cis + Anti = Racemic**.\n    *   Starting with a *cis*-alkene, an *anti*-addition will produce a racemic mixture (a 1:1 mixture of enantiomers).\n    *   Let's follow the mechanism to confirm:\n        *   **Step 1 (Epoxidation):** (Z)-oct-4-ene (cis) undergoes *syn*-addition with mCPBA. Since the alkene is symmetrical and cis, this forms a single *meso*-epoxide: (4R,5S)-cis-epoxyoctane.\n        *   **Step 2 (Ring Opening):** The *meso*-epoxide undergoes acid-catalyzed *anti*-attack by water.\n            *   Attack at carbon C4 produces the (4S,5S)-diol.\n            *   Attack at carbon C5 produces the (4R,5R)-diol.\n    *   Since attack at either carbon is equally likely, Reaction 2 yields a racemic mixture of two enantiomers: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. Let's call these compounds **D(+)** and **D(-)**.\n\n### **Analysis of the Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n*   **M:** (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (a meso compound)\n*   **D(+):** (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (an enantiomer)\n*   **D(-):** (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (the other enantiomer)\n\nThe stereochemical relationships are:\n*   **D(+)** and **D(-)** are enantiomers.\n*   **M** is a diastereomer of both **D(+)** and **D(-)**.\n\n### **Chromatographic Analysis (HPLC)**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   This type of column separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n    *   **Diastereomers** (like M and D(+)) have different physical properties and thus different retention times. They will be separated.\n    *   **Enantiomers** (like D(+) and D(-)) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They cannot be separated and will co-elute as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **two peaks**:\n        *   Peak 1: The meso compound (M)\n        *   Peak 2: The unresolved racemic mixture (D(+) and D(-))\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This type of column has a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment.\n    *   This allows the column to differentiate between enantiomers, as they will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n    *   Therefore, all three unique stereoisomers in the mixture will be separated.\n    *   The chromatogram will show **three peaks**:\n        *   Peak 1: The meso compound (M)\n        *   Peak 2: One enantiomer (e.g., D(+))\n        *   Peak 3: The other enantiomer (D(-))\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe **2 peaks** on the standard (achiral) HPLC and **3 peaks** on the chiral HPLC. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
