    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**Step 1: Deduce the molecular structure from the given information.**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This indicates a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two substituents attached.\n*   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum...indicate the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O)\"**: One of the substituents must contain a C=O group.\n*   **\"as well as an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X)\"**: One substituent is a halogen (e.g., F, Cl, Br, I) directly attached to the aromatic ring. This substituent has 0 carbon atoms.\n\nCombining these facts, we can determine the two substituents:\n1.  A halogen atom (-X).\n2.  A second substituent that contains both the carbonyl group and all 2 remaining carbon atoms. The most common and simple structure for a two-carbon substituent with a carbonyl group is the **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n\nTherefore, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the possible substitution patterns and their expected 1H NMR spectra.**\n\nA haloacetophenone has 4 protons on the aromatic ring and 3 protons on the methyl group of the acetyl substituent. The total number of protons is 7.\n\nThe substitution pattern can be ortho, meta, or para. Let's consider how the aromatic protons would appear in the 1H NMR spectrum for each isomer:\n*   **Ortho-isomer (1,2-disubstituted)**: The four aromatic protons are all in different chemical environments. This would lead to a complex pattern with four distinct signals (multiplets), not simple doublets.\n*   **Meta-isomer (1,3-disubstituted)**: This would also result in a complex pattern for the four aromatic protons. We would not expect to see two simple doublets.\n*   **Para-isomer (1,4-disubstituted)**: This isomer has a plane of symmetry passing through the two substituents.\n    *   The two protons next to (ortho to) the acetyl group are chemically equivalent.\n    *   The two protons next to (ortho to) the halogen are also chemically equivalent.\n    *   These two sets of protons couple with each other, resulting in a characteristic pattern of **two doublets**, each integrating to **2H**.\n    *   The acetyl group's methyl protons (-CH₃) have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a **singlet**, integrating to **3H**. The chemical shift for a methyl ketone is typically around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the predicted spectrum with the given options.**\n\n*   **Predicted spectrum for p-haloacetophenone**:\n    *   ~7.5-8.0 ppm: Aromatic region showing two doublets, each for 2H.\n    *   ~2.1-2.6 ppm: A singlet for 3H.\n    *   Total protons: 2H + 2H + 3H = 7H.\n\n*   **Analyzing the options:**\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This option shows two doublets (d) in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2H. This is the classic signature of a para-substituted benzene ring.\n        *   It also shows a singlet (s) integrating to 3H at 2.3 ppm, which is perfect for an acetyl methyl group.\n        *   This data is an excellent match for p-haloacetophenone.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The peak at 9.9 ppm is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a ketone. The structure would have to be p-halophenylacetaldehyde. However, for that structure, the methylene protons (-CH₂-) at ~3.7 ppm would be a doublet (split by the aldehyde proton), and the aldehyde proton would be a triplet (split by the methylene protons). The option incorrectly lists both as singlets.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   The chemical shifts ~4.6-4.8 ppm are too low for protons on an aromatic ring. This does not fit the described compound.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   The integration and splitting patterns for the aromatic protons (should be 4H total, not 1H) are incorrect. The chemical shifts are also not characteristic of the proposed structure.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, the only option that correctly represents the 1H NMR spectrum of a di-substituted aromatic compound with 8 carbons, a carbonyl group, and a halogen (specifically, p-haloacetophenone) is option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
