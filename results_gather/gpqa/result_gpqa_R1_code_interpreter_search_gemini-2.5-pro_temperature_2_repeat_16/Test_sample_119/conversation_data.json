    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the key quantities:**\n    *   **Parallax (plx):** Parallax is an angle that is inversely proportional to the distance (d) of a star. The relationship is `plx = 1/d` (assuming parallax is measured in arcseconds and distance in parsecs). From this, we can write the distance as `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   **Uniform distribution:** This is a crucial assumption. It means that the number density of stars (ρ), which is the number of stars per unit volume, is constant throughout space.\n    *   **Number of stars per unit range of parallax:** This is the quantity we want to find the dependence for. Mathematically, this can be represented as `dN/d(plx)`, where `N` is the number of stars. We want to find how this quantity changes as `plx` changes.\n\n2.  **Formulate the problem:** We need to find the number of stars (`dN`) that lie within a small parallax interval from `plx` to `plx + d(plx)`.\n\n3.  **Translate from parallax to distance:** A parallax interval `[plx, plx + d(plx)]` corresponds to a specific region in space.\n    *   A star with parallax `plx` is at a distance `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   A star with parallax `plx + d(plx)` is at a distance `d' = 1 / (plx + d(plx))`.\n    *   Since `d(plx)` is a small increment, this range of parallaxes corresponds to stars located in a thin spherical shell around the observer.\n\n4.  **Calculate the volume of the spherical shell:**\n    *   The radius of the inner surface of the shell is `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   The thickness of the shell, `dd`, can be found by differentiating `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd = d(1/plx) = (-1/plx^2) d(plx)`\n    *   We are interested in the magnitude of the thickness, so `|dd| = (1/plx^2) d(plx)`.\n    *   The volume of a thin spherical shell (`dV`) is approximately its surface area multiplied by its thickness.\n    *   Surface area of the sphere = `4 * π * d^2`.\n    *   Volume `dV = (Surface Area) * (thickness) = (4 * π * d^2) * |dd|`.\n\n5.  **Substitute the parallax relationships into the volume formula:**\n    *   Replace `d` with `1/plx`.\n    *   Replace `|dd|` with `(1/plx^2) d(plx)`.\n    *   `dV = (4 * π * (1/plx)^2) * (1/plx^2 * d(plx))`\n    *   `dV = (4 * π / plx^2) * (1 / plx^2) * d(plx)`\n    *   `dV = (4 * π / plx^4) * d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the number of stars in this volume:**\n    *   The number of stars (`dN`) in the volume `dV` is the number density (ρ) multiplied by the volume.\n    *   `dN = ρ * dV`\n    *   `dN = ρ * (4 * π / plx^4) * d(plx)`\n\n7.  **Find the number of stars per unit range of parallax:**\n    *   To find the quantity the question asks for (`dN/d(plx)`), we simply divide the expression for `dN` by `d(plx)`.\n    *   `dN / d(plx) = ρ * 4 * π / plx^4`\n    *   Since ρ (number density) and 4π are constants, we can see the proportionality:\n    *   `dN / d(plx) ∝ 1 / plx^4`\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax (`plx`) as `1/plx^4`. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
