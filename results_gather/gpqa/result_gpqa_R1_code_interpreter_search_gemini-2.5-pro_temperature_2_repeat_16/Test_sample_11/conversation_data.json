    "Here's the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Physics Principles**\n\nThe decay of a particle at rest must obey two fundamental conservation laws:\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n\nWe will also need the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)², where E is total energy, p is momentum, m₀ is rest mass, and c is the speed of light.\n\n**2. Define Variables and Given Information**\n\n*   The decay process is: Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu\n*   The Pi(+) is stationary, which means its initial momentum is zero (p_initial = 0) and its initial energy is just its rest energy.\n*   Rest energy of Pi(+) (M_pi * c²): 139.6 MeV\n*   Rest energy of mu(+) (M_mu * c²): 105.7 MeV\n*   The neutrino (nu) is assumed to be massless, so its rest mass (M_nu) and rest energy (M_nu * c²) are 0.\n*   We need to find KE_mu (kinetic energy of the muon) and KE_nu (kinetic energy of the neutrino).\n\n**3. Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n\nSince the initial momentum of the stationary pion is 0, the total momentum of the products must also be 0.\np_initial = p_final\n0 = p_mu + p_nu\n\nThis means the muon (mu+) and the neutrino (nu) must fly off in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude.\n|p_mu| = |p_nu| = p\n\n**4. Apply Conservation of Energy**\n\nEnergy Before = Energy After\nE_initial(Pi) = E_final(mu) + E_final(nu)\n\n*   E_initial(Pi) = M_pi * c² = 139.6 MeV (since it's at rest)\n*   E_final(mu) = KE_mu + M_mu * c² = KE_mu + 105.7 MeV\n*   E_final(nu) = KE_nu + M_nu * c² = KE_nu + 0 = KE_nu\n\nSubstituting these into the conservation equation:\n139.6 MeV = (KE_mu + 105.7 MeV) + KE_nu\n139.6 - 105.7 = KE_mu + KE_nu\n33.9 MeV = KE_mu + KE_nu  ---(Equation 1)\n\n**5. Combine Energy and Momentum using the Relativistic Relation**\n\nWe have two unknowns (KE_mu, KE_nu) and one equation. We need another equation, which we can derive by relating energy and momentum.\n\nFor the muon:\nE_mu² = (p_mu * c)² + (M_mu * c²)²\n\nFor the massless neutrino:\nE_nu² = (p_nu * c)² + (M_nu * c²)² = (p_nu * c)² + 0\nSo, E_nu = p_nu * c\nSince E_nu = KE_nu, we have KE_nu = p_nu * c.\n\nFrom momentum conservation, we know |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p. Therefore, p_mu*c = p_nu*c = p*c.\nThis means KE_nu = pc.\n\nNow we can write the energy-momentum equation for the muon in terms of KE_nu:\n(KE_mu + M_mu*c²)² = (pc)² + (M_mu*c²)²\n(KE_mu + M_mu*c²)² = (KE_nu)² + (M_mu*c²)²  ---(Equation 2)\n\n**6. Solve the System of Equations**\n\nWe can solve for KE_mu and KE_nu using Equation 1 and Equation 2. A more direct method is to rearrange the energy conservation equation and the energy-momentum equation.\n\nFrom conservation of energy: E_mu = M_pi*c² - E_nu.\nSubstitute this into the energy-momentum relation: E_mu² = (pc)² + (M_mu*c²)²\nRemember that for the neutrino, E_nu = pc.\n\n(M_pi*c² - E_nu)² = (E_nu)² + (M_mu*c²)²\n(M_pi*c²)² - 2*(M_pi*c²)*E_nu + (E_nu)² = (E_nu)² + (M_mu*c²)²\n(M_pi*c²)² - (M_mu*c²)² = 2*(M_pi*c²)*E_nu\n\nNow, solve for E_nu (which is the neutrino's kinetic energy, KE_nu):\nKE_nu = [ (M_pi*c²)² - (M_mu*c²)² ] / [ 2 * (M_pi*c²) ]\n\nLet's perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Rest mass energies in MeV\nM_pi_c2 = 139.6  # Pi(+)\nM_mu_c2 = 105.7  # mu(+)\n\n# Calculate the kinetic energy of the neutrino (KE_nu)\n# KE_nu = (M_pi_c2^2 - M_mu_c2^2) / (2 * M_pi_c2)\nKE_nu = (M_pi_c2**2 - M_mu_c2**2) / (2 * M_pi_c2)\n\n# From conservation of energy, the total kinetic energy is M_pi_c2 - M_mu_c2\ntotal_KE = M_pi_c2 - M_mu_c2\n\n# The kinetic energy of the muon is the remaining energy\nKE_mu = total_KE - KE_nu\n\nprint(f\"KE of muon (mu+): {KE_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"KE of neutrino (nu): {KE_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\n>>>\nKE of muon (mu+): 4.12 MeV\nKE of neutrino (nu): 29.79 MeV\n>>>\nThe calculated kinetic energy for the muon (mu+) is approximately **4.12 MeV** and for the neutrino (nu) is approximately **29.8 MeV** (rounding 29.79 MeV).\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nB) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\nC) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nD) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This is a classic problem in relativistic kinematics that can be solved by applying the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n### 1. Principle\n*   **Conservation of Momentum**: Since the initial particle (Pi+) is stationary, its momentum is zero. Therefore, the total momentum of the product particles (mu+ and nu) must also be zero. This implies they are emitted in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude. Let's call this magnitude 'p'.\n    *   p_mu = p_nu = p\n*   **Conservation of Energy**: The total energy before the decay (rest energy of the pion) must equal the total energy after the decay (the sum of the total energies of the muon and neutrino).\n    *   E_pi = E_mu + E_nu\n\n### 2. Given Information\n*   Rest energy of Pi+ (M_pi * c²): 139.6 MeV\n*   Rest energy of mu+ (M_mu * c²): 105.7 MeV\n*   Rest mass/energy of neutrino (nu) is assumed to be 0.\n*   Initial state: Pi+ is at rest, so its total energy is its rest energy.\n\n### 3. Derivation\nThe total energy of a particle is given by the relativistic formula: E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)².\n\n1.  **Energy of the products:**\n    *   For the muon (mu+): E_mu = KE_mu + M_mu*c²\n    *   For the massless neutrino (nu): E_nu = KE_nu. Its energy-momentum relation simplifies to E_nu = p*c.\n\n2.  **Applying conservation laws:**\n    *   From momentum conservation, since p_mu = p_nu = p, we can say that the neutrino's energy is `E_nu = p*c`.\n    *   Now look at the muon's energy-momentum relation: E_mu² = (p*c)² + (M_mu*c²)². We can substitute `p*c` with `E_nu`:\n        *   E_mu² = E_nu² + (M_mu*c²)²  **(Equation A)**\n\n3.  **Solving for the energies:**\n    *   From energy conservation, we have E_pi = E_mu + E_nu. We can rearrange this to `E_mu = E_pi - E_nu`.\n    *   Substitute this expression for E_mu into Equation A:\n        *   (E_pi - E_nu)² = E_nu² + (M_mu*c²)²\n    *   Expand the left side:\n        *   E_pi² - 2*E_pi*E_nu + E_nu² = E_nu² + (M_mu*c²)²\n    *   The E_nu² terms cancel out. Rearrange to solve for E_nu (which is the neutrino's kinetic energy):\n        *   E_pi² - (M_mu*c²)² = 2*E_pi*E_nu\n        *   **KE_nu = E_nu = [ E_pi² - (M_mu*c²)² ] / [ 2*E_pi ]**\n\n4.  **Calculation:**\n    *   KE_nu = [ (139.6)² - (105.7)² ] / [ 2 * 139.6 ]\n    *   KE_nu = [ 19488.16 - 11172.49 ] / [ 279.2 ]\n    *   KE_nu = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.8 MeV\n\n5.  **Finding the muon's kinetic energy (KE_mu):**\n    *   The total energy released as kinetic energy is the difference between the initial rest mass and the final rest masses:\n        *   Total KE = KE_mu + KE_nu = M_pi*c² - M_mu*c²\n        *   Total KE = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV\n    *   Now find KE_mu:\n        *   KE_mu = Total KE - KE_nu\n        *   KE_mu = 33.9 MeV - 29.8 MeV = 4.1 MeV\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are **KE_mu ≈ 4.1 MeV** and **KE_nu ≈ 29.8 MeV**.\n\nComparing this to the options:\nA) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nB) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\nC) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nD) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\n\nThe result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
