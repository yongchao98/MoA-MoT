    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the NMR Data:**\n    *   **Observation:** Two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton.\n    *   **Observation:** The integrals of the two peaks are roughly equal and sum to the expected value for one proton (1H).\n    *   **Observation:** The splitting is not due to spin-spin coupling.\n    *   **Inference:** This indicates the presence of two different molecular species in the sample, in approximately a 1:1 ratio. In these two species, the alpha-proton resides in a slightly different chemical environment, leading to two separate signals. Since they are two distinct species, this rules out an explanation based on the properties of a single, pure molecule (like complex coupling).\n\n2.  **Analyze the LC-MS Data:**\n    *   **Observation:** Two separate peaks are observed in the liquid chromatography (LC) trace, and they have equal intensities.\n    *   **Inference:** LC separates compounds based on their physical properties (like polarity, size, etc.). The presence of two peaks confirms that there are two distinct, separable compounds in the mixture. The equal intensities corroborate the 1:1 ratio suggested by the NMR.\n    *   **Observation:** Both LC peaks give the exact same mass spectrum (MS), and this mass is consistent with the expected target molecule.\n    *   **Inference:** Mass spectrometry separates ions by their mass-to-charge ratio. The fact that both species have the same mass means they are isomers—molecules with the same chemical formula but different arrangements of atoms. This definitively rules out contamination with a precursor or a side-product of a different molecular weight (like a \"double-coupled\" product).\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Options based on the Combined Data:**\n\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n        *   **Definition:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have the same molecular formula and thus the same mass.\n        *   **NMR:** Diastereoisomers have different physical and chemical properties. Because they are chemically distinct, their corresponding protons (like the alpha-proton) exist in different chemical environments and will show different chemical shifts in an NMR spectrum. A 1:1 mixture of diastereomers would show two peaks of equal intensity for the affected proton. This matches the NMR data.\n        *   **LC-MS:** Because they have different physical properties, diastereomers can be separated by standard (achiral) chromatography. This matches the observation of two LC peaks. Since they are isomers, they would have the same mass. This matches the MS data.\n        *   **Plausibility in Peptides:** This is a very common scenario in peptide chemistry. It can arise from the epimerization (racemization) of a chiral center during a coupling or deprotection step, or from cis-trans isomerism around an amide bond (especially a proline peptide bond), which also creates diastereomeric conformers that can be stable enough to be observed separately. This option is fully consistent with all observations.\n\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n        *   **Definition:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror-image stereoisomers.\n        *   **NMR:** In a standard (achiral) solvent, enantiomers are indistinguishable and give identical NMR spectra. You would only see one set of peaks, not two.\n        *   **LC-MS:** Enantiomers cannot be separated by standard (achiral) LC. A special chiral column would be needed.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This option is inconsistent with both the NMR and LC data.\n\n    *   **C) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:**\n        *   **Definition:** A precursor is a starting material or an intermediate that failed to react completely.\n        *   **LC-MS:** A precursor would have a different chemical formula and therefore a different molecular weight than the final product. The MS data shows both peaks have the *same mass* as the expected product, ruling this out.\n\n    *   **D) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:**\n        *   **Definition:** A side reaction where an extra amino acid is added, creating a larger molecule.\n        *   **LC-MS:** This side product would have a significantly higher molecular weight than the target molecule. The MS data rules this out.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only explanation that perfectly fits all the evidence—two NMR peaks for one proton, two separable LC peaks, and the same mass for both species—is that the compound exists as a 1:1 mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\n<<<A>>>"
