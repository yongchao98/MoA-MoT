    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula:\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data\n\nFirst, let's break down the information provided about the unknown compound.\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This tells us the core of the molecule is a benzene ring (C6) with two hydrogen atoms replaced by substituents. This core has the formula **C6H4**. The di-substitution and two aromatic signals in the NMR suggest a symmetric substitution pattern, most likely *para* (1,4-substitution). A *para*-substituted ring would have 4 aromatic protons appearing as two distinct signals due to symmetry.\n*   **FTIR shows an ester group:** The compound contains an ester functional group, which has the formula **-COO-**. This accounts for one carbon and two oxygen atoms.\n*   **¹H NMR Data & \"No -CH2 groups\" constraint:**\n    *   **Vinyl-H (2 signals, one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This splitting pattern is highly characteristic of a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**. The proton on the carbon next to the benzene ring would be a doublet (split by the other vinyl proton). The proton on the carbon next to the methyl group would be a doublet of quartets (split by the other vinyl proton and the three protons of the methyl group). This fragment has the formula **C3H5** and contains two vinyl protons and one methyl group.\n    *   **–CH3 groups (2 signals):** We have identified one -CH3 group from the propenyl substituent. The second -CH3 group must be part of the ester to satisfy the **\"no -CH2 groups\"** rule. An ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) is impossible because it contains a -CH2- group. Therefore, the ester must be either a **methyl ester (-COOCH3)** or an **acetate ester (-OOCCH3)**. Both possibilities introduce a second methyl group without introducing a methylene group.\n        *   If it's a methyl ester, the substituent is -COOCH3 (formula **C2H3O2**).\n        *   If it's an acetate ester, the substituent is -OOCCH3 (formula **C2H3O2**).\n\n### 2. Assemble the Molecular Fragments\n\nNow, we can sum the atoms from the identified fragments to determine the overall molecular formula.\n\nWe have three main parts:\n1.  The di-substituted benzene ring: **C6H4**\n2.  The propenyl group (to account for the vinyl signals and one CH3): **C3H5**\n3.  The part of the ester containing the second CH3 group (either -COOCH3 or -OOCCH3): This contributes **C2H3O2** to the overall formula.\n\nLet's add them up:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from ester part) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from methyl ester/acetate) = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from ester group) = **2**\n\nThis gives a final chemical formula of **C11H12O2**.\n\n### 3. Verify with Degrees of Unsaturation (DBE)\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) tells us the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\nThe formula is: DBE = C + 1 - (H/2)\n\nLet's analyze our proposed structure and the options:\n*   **Expected DBE from structure:** A benzene ring has 4 DBE (1 ring + 3 double bonds). The vinyl group has one C=C double bond (1 DBE). The ester group has one C=O double bond (1 DBE). Total expected DBE = 4 + 1 + 1 = **6**.\n\n*   **DBE for the options:**\n    *   A) C12H12O2: DBE = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 7\n    *   B) C12H14O2: DBE = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 6\n    *   C) **C11H12O2**: DBE = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = **6**\n    *   D) C11H14O2: DBE = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 5\n\n*   **Comparison:** The calculated DBE for C11H12O2 (6) perfectly matches the expected DBE from the structural features identified from the spectra. Option D (DBE=5) can be eliminated as it's missing a double bond (the vinyl group). Option A (DBE=7) has an extra degree of unsaturation that cannot be explained by the data.\n\n*   **Eliminating Option B (C12H14O2):** This formula has the correct DBE of 6. However, to construct a molecule with this formula using the required fragments (propenyl, no CH2), we would need the substituents to sum to C6H10 (C12H14 - C6H4). If one substituent is propenyl (C3H5), the other must be C3H5 as well. A second propenyl group would not fit the \"two -CH3 signals\" description. Alternatively, if one group is propenyl (C3H5), and we need a CH3 group and another C2H2, this becomes structurally implausible without violating the \"no CH2\" rule. The most straightforward way to have C12H14O2 would be with a propenyl group (C3H5) and an ethyl-ester (-COOCH2CH3), but this is explicitly ruled out by the absence of -CH2 signals.\n\nTherefore, C11H12O2 is the only formula that fits all the provided information.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_dbe(formula_str):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) for a chemical formula C_c H_h O_o.\"\"\"\n    import re\n    \n    parts = re.findall(r'([A-Z])(\\d*)', formula_str)\n    \n    counts = {'C': 0, 'H': 0, 'O': 0}\n    for element, count in parts:\n        count = int(count) if count else 1\n        if element in counts:\n            counts[element] += count\n\n    c = counts['C']\n    h = counts['H']\n    \n    if c == 0:\n        return \"Invalid formula (no Carbon)\"\n        \n    dbe = c - h/2 + 1\n    return dbe\n\nformulas = {\n    \"C12H12O2\": \"A\",\n    \"C12H14O2\": \"B\",\n    \"C11H12O2\": \"C\",\n    \"C11H14O2\": \"D\"\n}\n\nprint(\"DBE Calculation for Options:\")\nfor formula, option in formulas.items():\n    dbe = calculate_dbe(formula)\n    print(f\"Option {option}) {formula}: DBE = {dbe}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nExpected DBE from spectral data (Benzene Ring + C=C + C=O) = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\")\nprint(\"This matches options B and C.\")\nprint(\"Based on fragment analysis and the 'no-CH2' rule, only C11H12O2 is possible.\")\n\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The user wants me to identify the correct chemical formula from a list of options based on spectroscopic data.\n\n**My reasoning process:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the clues from the problem statement.**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells me the core of the molecule is a benzene ring (C6) with two substituents. The aromatic part of the formula will be C6H4. The ring itself accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (DBE: 1 for the ring and 3 for the double bonds).\n    *   **\"FTIR ... shows an ester group\"**: An ester group is -COO-. This adds a C=O double bond, which is one more degree of unsaturation. It also adds two oxygen atoms to the formula.\n    *   **\"1H NMR spectrum shows six signals\"**: This describes the different proton environments in the molecule.\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\"**: A di-substituted benzene ring with 4 protons that give only two signals strongly suggests a *para* (1,4) substitution pattern due to its symmetry.\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\"**: Vinyl protons are hydrogens attached to a C=C double bond. This splitting pattern (d, dq) is classic for a **propenyl group**, specifically `R-CH=CH-CH3`.\n        *   The H on the carbon next to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl-H (making it a doublet) and by the three methyl protons (making each peak of the doublet a quartet). Hence, a doublet of quartets.\n        *   The other vinyl H is only split by the adjacent vinyl H, so it appears as a doublet.\n        *   This propenyl group `(-CH=CH-CH3)` adds 1 C=C double bond (1 DBE), 3 carbons, and 5 hydrogens. It also accounts for one of the two `-CH3` signals.\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups\"**: We've already accounted for one `–CH3` group in the propenyl substituent. The second `–CH3` group must be part of the ester.\n    *   **\"no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups\"**: This is a crucial constraint. An ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) would have a -CH2- group, so that's not possible. The ester must be either a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate (-OOCCH3) to satisfy the \"no -CH2-\" and \"two -CH3\" rules. Both of these fragments add a `–CH3` group without a `–CH2` group.\n\n2.  **Assemble the pieces to determine the molecular formula.**\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** C6H4\n    *   **Substituent 1 (Propenyl):** -CH=CH-CH3 -> C3H5\n    *   **Substituent 2 (Ester with a Methyl):** -COOCH3 (methyl ester) or -OOCCH3 (acetate). In both cases, this piece contributes C2H3O2 to the total formula.\n    *   **Total Formula Calculation:**\n        *   Carbon (C): 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**\n        *   Hydrogen (H): 4 + 5 + 3 = **12**\n        *   Oxygen (O): **2**\n    *   The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n3.  **Verify the result using the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE).**\n    *   The general formula for DBE is `C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *   DBE for our deduced formula C11H12O2: `11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6`.\n    *   Let's check if this matches our structural analysis:\n        *   Benzene ring = 4 DBE\n        *   C=C in the propenyl group = 1 DBE\n        *   C=O in the ester group = 1 DBE\n        *   Total expected DBE = 4 + 1 + 1 = **6**.\n    *   The DBE matches perfectly.\n\n4.  **Compare with the given options.**\n    *   A) C12H12O2\n    *   B) C12H14O2\n    *   C) **C11H12O2**\n    *   D) C11H14O2\n    *   Our deduced formula, C11H12O2, matches option C.\n\nThe Python code was used to confirm the DBE calculation for all options, reinforcing the conclusion that C11H12O2 has the correct number of rings and pi bonds to match the structural fragments identified from the NMR and IR data.\n\n<<<C>>>"
