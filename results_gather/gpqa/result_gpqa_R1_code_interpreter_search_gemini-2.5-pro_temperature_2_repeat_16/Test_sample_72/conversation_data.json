    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem.\n\n### **Part 1: Calculating the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\n1.  **Identify the given information:**\n    *   Mass of astronaut 1 ($m_1$) = 2m\n    *   Velocity of astronaut 1 ($v_1$) = 0.6c (in the positive x-direction)\n    *   Mass of astronaut 2 ($m_2$) = 3m\n    *   Velocity of astronaut 2 ($v_2$) = 0.5c (in the positive x-direction)\n    *   `c` is the speed of light.\n\n2.  **Choose the correct formula:**\n    Since the astronauts are traveling at relativistic speeds, we must use the formula for relativistic velocity subtraction. The formula for the relative velocity ($v_{rel}$) between two objects A and B moving in the same direction with velocities $v_A$ and $v_B$ is:\n    $v_{rel} = \\frac{v_A - v_B}{1 - \\frac{v_A v_B}{c^2}}$\n\n3.  **Substitute the values into the formula:**\n    Let $v_A = v_1 = 0.6c$ and $v_B = v_2 = 0.5c$.\n\n    $v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}$\n\n4.  **Simplify the expression:**\n    $v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}}$\n    $v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3}$\n    $v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n    $v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c$\n\n5.  **Calculate the numerical value:**\n    $v_{rel} \\approx 0.142857... c$\n\n    Rounding to two decimal places, we get $v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$.\n\n### **Part 2: Calculating the Total Energy (E)**\n\n1.  **Choose the correct formula:**\n    The total energy (E) of a particle with rest mass $m_0$ moving at a relativistic speed `v` is given by Einstein's energy-mass equivalence principle:\n    $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$\n    where $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is defined as:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$\n\n2.  **Calculate the total energy of the system:**\n    The total energy of the system is the sum of the total energies of the two astronauts.\n    $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$\n\n3.  **Calculate the energy of astronaut 1 ($E_1$):**\n    *   $m_0 = m_1 = 2m$\n    *   $v = v_1 = 0.6c$\n    *   First, calculate the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_1$:\n        $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n    *   Now, calculate the energy $E_1$:\n        $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = 1.25 \\times (2m) c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n4.  **Calculate the energy of astronaut 2 ($E_2$):**\n    *   $m_0 = m_2 = 3m$\n    *   $v = v_2 = 0.5c$\n    *   First, calculate the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_2$:\n        $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}}$\n    *   Now, calculate the energy $E_2$:\n        $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} \\times (3m) c^2$\n\n5.  **Calculate the total energy ($E_{total}$):**\n    $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} \\times 3m c^2$\n    $E_{total} = \\left(2.5 + \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{0.75}}\\right) mc^2$\n\nTo get the final numerical value, we can use a simple python script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Part 1: Relative Velocity\nv1 = 0.6\nv2 = 0.5\nv_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - v1 * v2)\nprint(f\"Relative velocity (v_rel/c): {v_rel:.3f}\")\n\n# Part 2: Total Energy\n# Astronaut 1\nm1 = 2\ngamma1 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v1**2)\nE1 = gamma1 * m1 # E1 in units of mc^2\n\n# Astronaut 2\nm2 = 3\ngamma2 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v2**2)\nE2 = gamma2 * m2 # E2 in units of mc^2\n\n# Total Energy\nE_total = E1 + E2\nprint(f\"Total energy (E_total / (mc^2)): {E_total:.3f}\")\n```\nExecuting the code:\n```text\nRelative velocity (v_rel/c): 0.143\nTotal energy (E_total / (mc^2)): 5.964\n```\nThe calculation gives:\n*   $v_{rel} \\approx 0.143c$ which rounds to $0.14c$.\n*   $E_{total} \\approx 5.964 mc^2$ which rounds to $5.96 mc^2$.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nComparing our calculated values with the given options:\n*   A) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\n*   B) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\n*   C) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\n*   D) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2\n\nOur results, $v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$ and $E_{total} \\approx 5.96 mc^2$, match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
