    "This problem requires calculating the equilibrium concentration of free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) from the dissociation of a Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n1.  **Write the chemical equation for the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex.**\n    The complex is $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$. The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n    $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n    Here, $EDTA^{4-}$ represents the fully deprotonated form of EDTA, often denoted as $Y^{4-}$.\n\n2.  **Define the equilibrium constant.**\n    The problem provides the formation constant, $K_f$ (also written as $K_{Ca-EDTA}$), for the reaction:\n    $Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n    The phrase \"ideal pH\" implies that we should use this absolute formation constant without considering the effects of protonation on EDTA.\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table.**\n    We start with a 0.02 M solution of the Ca-EDTA complex. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates to reach equilibrium.\n\n| Species             | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| ------------------- | :---------: | :--------: | :---------------: |\n| $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$   |    0.02     |     -x     |      0.02 - x     |\n| $Ca^{2+}$           |      0      |     +x     |         x         |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$         |      0      |     +x     |         x         |\n\n4.  **Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression.**\n    $K_f = \\frac{(0.02 - x)}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n5.  **Solve for x.**\n    Since the formation constant $K_f$ is very large, the equilibrium lies far to the left for the dissociation reaction. This means 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can simplify the equation by making the approximation:\n    $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\n    The equation becomes:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n    Now, rearrange and solve for x, which represents the equilibrium concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ ions:\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x^2 \\approx 0.4 \\times 10^{-12} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n\nTo avoid potential rounding errors, let's use a calculator or script for the final calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\nK_f = 5e10\ninitial_complex_conc = 0.02\n\n# We solve the equation K_f = (initial_complex_conc) / x^2\n# x^2 = initial_complex_conc / K_f\nx_squared = initial_complex_conc / K_f\n\n# x = sqrt(x_squared)\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\nprint(f\"{x:.2e}\")\n```\nexecution_result:\n6.32e-07\n\nThe calculated value for x is $6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n6.  **Final check.**\n    The value $x = 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M is the equilibrium concentration of $Ca^{2+}$. This value is much smaller than 0.02 M, so the initial approximation was valid. Comparing this result to the given options:\n    A) 6.3x10^-7 M\n    B) 5.0x10^-3 M\n    C) 1.0x10^-2 M\n    D) 2.0x10^-2 M\n\n    The calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for solving the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Chemical Equilibrium:** The problem involves the dissociation of the calcium-EDTA complex, denoted as $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$. This complex is in equilibrium with its constituent ions, $Ca^{2+}$ and $EDTA^{4-}$. The reaction for the formation of the complex is:\n    $Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$\n\n2.  **Define the Equilibrium Constant:** The stability or formation constant ($K_f$, also given as $K_{Ca-EDTA}$) for this reaction is given by:\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n    Since we are starting with the complex and it is dissociating, we are looking at the reverse reaction:\n    $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n3.  **Set Up an ICE Table:** We can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the equilibrium concentrations. We start with 0.02 M of the complex and assume it dissociates by an amount 'x'.\n\n| Species             | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :------------------ | :---------- | :--------- | :-------------- |\n| $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$   | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| $Ca^{2+}$           | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$         | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n4.  **Substitute Equilibrium Concentrations into the $K_f$ Expression:**\n    $K_f = \\frac{(0.02 - x)}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n5.  **Simplify and Solve for x:** The formation constant ($K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10}$) is very large. This indicates that the equilibrium strongly favors the formation of the complex, and very little of it will dissociate. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can make the approximation that $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$.\n\n    The equation simplifies to:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n    Now, we rearrange the equation to solve for x, which represents the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ ions at equilibrium:\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated concentration of calcium ions is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. This matches option A. The Python code executed in the background confirms this calculation, yielding a result of 6.32e-07.\n\n<<<A>>>"
