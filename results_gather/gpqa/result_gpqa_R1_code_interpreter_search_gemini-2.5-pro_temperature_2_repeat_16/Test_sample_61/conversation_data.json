    "This question asks for the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize a complex molecule, 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, from ethynylcyclohexane. Let's break down the problem by analyzing the starting material, the target product, and the proposed reaction sequences.\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material and Target Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. Its structure is a cyclohexane ring attached to an ethynyl group (-C≡CH). Formula: C8H12.\n    ```\n        _\n       / \\\n    --C≡CH\n      | |\n      \\_/\n    ```\n*   **Target Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let's parse this IUPAC name to determine the structure.\n    *   The parent molecule is `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`. This means a `-CHO` (carbaldehyde) group is attached to a cyclohexane ring. The ring carbon where the `-CHO` is attached is designated as C1.\n    *   A substituent is located at position `1-` of the cyclohexane ring. This means there is another substituent on the same carbon (C1) as the `-CHO` group.\n    *   The substituent is `(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)`. This is a methyl group (`-CH3`) that is itself substituted with a `hydroxy` (`-OH`) group and a `cyclohexyl` group (`-C6H11`). So, the substituent is `-CH(OH)C6H11`.\n    *   Putting it all together, the structure has a cyclohexane ring. Its C1 carbon is bonded to four different groups: the rest of the ring (C2 and C6), a `-CHO` group, and a `-CH(OH)C6H11` group.\n    \n    This target structure contains two cyclohexane rings and has a total of 6 (ring 1) + 1 (CHO) + 1 (methine) + 6 (ring 2) = 14 carbons. The starting material has only one ring and 8 carbons. This large difference suggests that the reaction might involve dimerization or that the provided name is incorrect. It's common in such problems for the product name to have a typo. Let's analyze the reaction pathways provided in the options to see which one is chemically sound.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction Sequences**\n\nWe will evaluate each option step-by-step. All sequences start with ethynylcyclohexane (Cy-C≡CH, where Cy is cyclohexyl).\n\n*   **A) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)2; 4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O**\n    1.  `NaNH2, methyl chloride`: This sequence first forms the acetylide anion (Cy-C≡C⁻) and then alkylates it with CH3Cl, yielding 1-cyclohexylpropyne (Cy-C≡C-CH3).\n    2.  `H2/Pd`: This is a strong hydrogenation catalyst that reduces the alkyne all the way to an alkane: propylcyclohexane (Cy-CH2-CH2-CH3).\n    3.  `Ba(OH)2`: Barium hydroxide is a base. It will not react with an alkane. The subsequent reagent set (H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O) is for alkyne hydration, which makes no sense after the alkyne has been reduced to an alkane. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 1. NaNH2, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. NH4OH**\n    1.  `NaNH2, methanol`: NaNH2 is a very strong base. It will deprotonate the terminal alkyne (Cy-C≡CH) to give Cy-C≡C⁻. However, methanol (CH3OH) is a protic solvent and a weak acid. The acetylide anion would immediately be protonated by methanol, regenerating the starting alkyne (Cy-C≡CH) and forming methoxide (CH3O⁻). This first step is futile. Therefore, this sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. Ba(OH)2**\n    1.  `NaNH2, methyl chloride`: As in A, this produces 1-cyclohexylpropyne (Cy-C≡C-CH3).\n    2.  `H2/Pd-calcium carbonate`: This is Lindlar's catalyst, which selectively reduces an alkyne to a *cis* (or *Z*) alkene. The product is (Z)-1-cyclohexylprop-1-ene (Cy-CH=CH-CH3).\n    3.  `O3 / (CH3)2S`: This is ozonolysis with a reductive workup (using dimethyl sulfide). It cleaves the double bond and converts each carbon of the double bond into a carbonyl group. Cleavage of `Cy-CH=CH-CH3` will yield cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (Cy-CHO) and acetaldehyde (CH3CHO).\n    4.  `Ba(OH)2`: This is a base used to catalyze an aldol reaction. We have a mixture of two aldehydes: cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and acetaldehyde. An aldol reaction will occur between them. Acetaldehyde has acidic α-protons and will form an enolate, which then attacks the carbonyl group of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (which is less likely to form an enolate). This leads to a crossed-aldol product: 3-cyclohexyl-3-hydroxypropanal (Cy-CH(OH)-CH2-CHO).\n    This sequence of reactions is chemically logical and sound. Although the product formed (3-cyclohexyl-3-hydroxypropanal) does not match the complex product name given in the question, it's possible the name is incorrect. A very common typo would be writing `1-` instead of `2-` and intending the self-aldol product of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, `2-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`. Sequence C provides the precursor for this product and the conditions for the reaction. Among all options, this is the only plausible chemical transformation.\n\n*   **D) 1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ H2O; 4. NH4OH**\n    1.  `NaNH2, ethyl chloride`: This produces 1-cyclohexylbut-1-yne (Cy-C≡C-CH2CH3).\n    2.  `Li/liq. NH3`: This is a dissolving metal reduction, which reduces an alkyne to a *trans* (or *E*) alkene: (E)-1-cyclohexylbut-1-ene (Cy-CH=CH-CH2CH3).\n    3.  `O3 / H2O`: This is ozonolysis with an oxidative workup (using water, often with H2O2 byproduct from O3 reaction). This cleaves the double bond and oxidizes any resulting aldehydes to carboxylic acids. The products would be cyclohexanecarboxylic acid (Cy-COOH) and propanoic acid (CH3CH2COOH).\n    4.  `NH4OH`: This base would neutralize the carboxylic acids to form ammonium salts. This sequence does not produce an aldehyde, which is a key feature of the target molecule. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing the four options, sequence **C** is the only one that describes a series of chemically correct and standard reactions that lead to an aldol-type product. Options A, B, and D contain fundamental flaws in their reaction steps. Despite the discrepancy between the name of the target product and the actual product of sequence C, it is overwhelmingly likely that C is the intended answer and the product name in the question is erroneous.\n\n<<<C>>>"
