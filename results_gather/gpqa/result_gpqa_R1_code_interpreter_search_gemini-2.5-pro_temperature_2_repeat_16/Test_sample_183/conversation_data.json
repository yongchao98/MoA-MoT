    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down the structure:\n*   **Benzene ring:** The core structure.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   An `ethoxy` group (-OCH2CH3) at C1.\n    *   A `tert-butyl` group (-C(CH3)3) at C2.\n    *   A `nitro` group (-NO2) at C3.\n*   **Relative positions:**\n    *   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho* to each other.\n    *   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta* to each other.\n    *   -tBu and -NO2 are *ortho* to each other.\n\nThis 1,2,3-trisubstitution pattern is challenging to achieve due to standard directing effects of the groups.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\n*   **-OEt (Ethoxy):** Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-Butyl):** Activating, *ortho, para*-director. It is very bulky, which sterically hinders substitution at the *ortho* position.\n*   **-NH2 (Amino):** Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director. Often protected as an acetamide (-NHCOCH3) to moderate its reactivity.\n*   **-NO2 (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **-SO3H (Sulfonic acid):** Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director. It's an excellent reversible blocking group, often used to control substitution position.\n\n**3. Evaluate Potential Synthetic Strategies & Analyze the Options**\n\nA common strategy for achieving unusual substitution patterns is to use a **blocking group**, such as a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H), to block a reactive position (usually the *para* position), force a reaction at another site, and then remove the blocking group. Option B is the only one that uses this strategy, making it a strong candidate. Let's analyze it in detail.\n\n**Analysis of Option B**\n\nLet's assume the typos (e.g., \"iii) ... iv)\") are corrected and the steps are sequential.\n\n*   **i) Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-Butylbenzene:** This is a standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n*   **ii) tert-Butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 → 4-tert-Butylbenzenesulfonic acid:** This is electrophilic aromatic sulfonation. The bulky *tert*-butyl group directs substitution to the *para* position, which is sterically accessible. This step successfully installs the -SO3H group as a blocking group at the position *para* to the *tert*-butyl group.\n*   **iii) 4-tert-Butylbenzenesulfonic acid + HNO3/H2SO4 → 4-tert-Butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid:** This is nitration. We have two groups on the ring: -tBu (an *o,p*-director) and -SO3H (a *m*-director). Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same positions: the ones *ortho* to the *t*-butyl group and *meta* to the sulfonic acid group. The product formed is `4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`. Let's analyze the relative positions of the key groups: the *tert*-butyl and the nitro group are *meta* to each other. This does not match the *ortho* relationship in the final product.\n\nThere seems to be a fundamental flaw in this line of reasoning or the question itself. Let's reconsider the sulfonation/alkylation equilibria. Friedel-Crafts alkylation and sulfonation are reversible under acidic conditions. Under thermodynamic control (higher temp, longer time), the bulky groups will arrange to be *meta* to each other to minimize steric strain.\n\n**A Corrected Interpretation of Option B involving Thermodynamic Control:**\n\n1.  **i) Benzene → tert-Butylbenzene:** Standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n2.  **ii) tert-Butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 (Heat) → 3-tert-Butylbenzenesulfonic acid:** Under thermodynamic control, the kinetically favored *para* product rearranges to the more stable *meta* isomer.\n3.  **iii) 3-tert-Butylbenzenesulfonic acid + HNO3/H2SO4 → 5-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid:** Now, let's nitrate the *meta* isomer.\n    *   -tBu (at C1) directs *o,p* (to C2, C4, C6).\n    *   -SO3H (at C3) directs *m* (to C2, C4, C6).\n    *   Both groups direct to the same positions. The least sterically hindered position for nitration would be C5 (para to -SO3H's meta-directing influence). This yields `5-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`.\n\nThis path also does not seem to lead to the correct precursors. The options appear to be flawed. However, we must choose the best fit.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the other options to be certain.\n*   **Option A:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline (step iii) is problematic. The amine's lone pair complexes with the AlCl3 Lewis acid, deactivating the ring. This option is incorrect.\n*   **Option D:** This sequence was analyzed and shown to produce a 1,2,4-substituted product (`1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-(tert-butyl)benzene`), not the required 1,2,3-isomer. This option is incorrect.\n*   **Option C:** This sequence is chemically invalid as written. Step (iv) calls for `NaNO2/HCl`, a diazotization reagent, but the substrate from step (iii) (`4-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid`) has no amino group to diazotize. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion by Elimination**\n\nOptions A, C, and D are demonstrably incorrect due to invalid chemical steps or leading to the wrong isomer. Option B, while containing confusing or potentially incorrect steps (especially step vi), is the only one that employs a plausible high-level strategy (blocking group) for creating a complex substitution pattern. In the context of a multiple-choice question that may have errors, the one built on the most sound strategic principle is the most likely intended answer. The synthesis of 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzenes is notoriously complex, and this sequence, despite its apparent flaws, points towards a classic approach. Therefore, it is the \"best\" answer among the given choices.\n\nThe perplexing step `vi) HNO3/H2SO4` applied to a diazonium salt has no standard interpretation, and the relative stereochemistry of the intermediates appears incorrect under kinetic control. However, given that all other options are clearly wrong, B is the only possibility left.\n\n<<<B>>>"
