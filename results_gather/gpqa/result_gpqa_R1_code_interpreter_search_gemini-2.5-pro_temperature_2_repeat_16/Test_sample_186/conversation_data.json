    "To determine how many of the listed stars are detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph on a VLT UT, we need to follow a two-step process for each star:\n1.  **Check observability:** Can the star be observed from the Paranal Observatory in Chile?\n2.  **Check detectability:** If observable, is the star bright enough to achieve the required signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 10 in a 1-hour exposure?\n\n### Step 1: Observability from Paranal Observatory\n\nThe Paranal Observatory is located at a latitude of approximately -24.6 degrees. A star is generally considered observable if its declination (DEC) satisfies the condition: DEC < 90° - |latitude|. In this case, DEC < 90° - |-24.6°| = 65.4°.\n\nLet's check each star:\n*   **a) Canopus:** Declination is approximately -52° 42'. Since -52.7° < 65.4°, Canopus is observable.\n*   **b) Polaris:** Declination is approximately +89° 16'. Since +89.26° > 65.4°, Polaris is too far north to be observed from Paranal.\n*   **c), d), e), f) Generic Stars:** The declination is given as 0°. Since 0° < 65.4°, these stars are observable.\n\nSo, Polaris is not observable, leaving 5 potentially detectable stars.\n\n### Step 2: Detectability with ESPRESSO\n\nThe condition for detection is achieving an S/N of at least 10 in a 1-hour exposure. We need to determine the apparent V-band magnitude (m_V) for each star and compare it to the capabilities of ESPRESSO.\n\nAccording to the ESPRESSO ETC and performance graphs, to achieve S/N=10 in 1 hour (3600s), a star must be brighter than an apparent magnitude of approximately V ≈ 16 mag.\n\nNow, let's find the apparent magnitude of the observable stars:\n*   **a) Canopus:** The apparent magnitude of Canopus is V = -0.74. This is extremely bright, far brighter than the V=16 limit. Therefore, **Canopus is detectable.**\n*   **b) Polaris:** Not observable.\n*   **c) to f) Generic Stars:** We use the distance modulus formula to calculate the apparent magnitude (m_V) from the absolute magnitude (M_V = 15) and distance (d):\n    *   m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d / 10 pc)\n    *   Since M_V = 15, the formula simplifies to: m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(d / 10)\n\nLet's calculate m_V for each:\n*   **c) Star at 10 pc:**\n    m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(10 / 10) = 15 + 5 * log10(1) = 15 + 0 = 15.0\n    Since 15.0 < 16, **this star is detectable.**\n*   **d) Star at 200 pc:**\n    m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(200 / 10) = 15 + 5 * log10(20) ≈ 15 + 5 * 1.301 = 15 + 6.505 = 21.5\n    Since 21.5 > 16, this star is too faint and **is not detectable.**\n*   **e) Star at 5 pc:**\n    m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(5 / 10) = 15 + 5 * log10(0.5) ≈ 15 + 5 * (-0.301) = 15 - 1.505 = 13.5\n    Since 13.5 < 16, **this star is detectable.**\n*   **f) Star at 50 pc:**\n    m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(50 / 10) = 15 + 5 * log10(5) ≈ 15 + 5 * 0.699 = 15 + 3.495 = 18.5\n    Since 18.5 > 16, this star is too faint and **is not detectable.**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCounting the detectable stars:\n1.  Canopus (a): Yes\n2.  Polaris (b): No (not observable)\n3.  Star at 10 pc (c): Yes\n4.  Star at 200 pc (d): No (too faint)\n5.  Star at 5 pc (e): Yes\n6.  Star at 50 pc (f): No (too faint)\n\nIn total, 3 of the listed stars (a, c, e) would be detectable by ESPRESSO under the given conditions.\n\n<<<B>>>"
