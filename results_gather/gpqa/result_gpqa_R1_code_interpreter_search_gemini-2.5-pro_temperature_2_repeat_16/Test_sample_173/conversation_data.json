    "This problem requires us to calculate the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment using both relativistic and classical mechanics and then find the difference.\n\n### 1. Define the parameters\n\n*   Initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus, E_initial = M*c² = 300 GeV.\n*   Let the rest masses of the two fragments be m1 and m2.\n*   The more massive fragment is m1, so m1 = 2 * m2.\n*   The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M.\n\n### 2. Calculate the rest masses and Q-value\n\nFirst, let's find the rest masses (and rest-mass energies) of the fragments.\n\n1.  Substitute m1 = 2 * m2 into the sum equation:\n    (2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M\n    3 * m2 = 0.99 * M\n    m2 = 0.33 * M\n\n2.  Now find m1:\n    m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M\n\n3.  Convert these masses to rest-mass energies:\n    *   Rest energy of fragment 1 (m1): E_rest1 = m1*c² = 0.66 * (M*c²) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV.\n    *   Rest energy of fragment 2 (m2): E_rest2 = m2*c² = 0.33 * (M*c²) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV.\n\n4.  The total kinetic energy (Q-value) released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest energy and the final total rest energy:\n    Q = E_initial - (E_rest1 + E_rest2)\n    Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)\n    Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV.\n    This energy is shared between the two fragments: Q = T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.\n\n### 3. Classical Calculation of T1\n\nIn classical mechanics, for a system at rest that splits into two parts, the momenta are equal and opposite (p1 = p2 = p). The kinetic energy is T = p² / (2m).\n\n1.  The ratio of the kinetic energies is:\n    T1_classical / T2_classical = (p² / (2*m1)) / (p² / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1\n\n2.  Since m1 = 2 * m2, the ratio is:\n    T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / (2 * m2) = 1/2.\n    This means T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical.\n\n3.  Use the total kinetic energy Q:\n    T1_classical + T2_classical = Q\n    T1_classical + (2 * T1_classical) = Q\n    3 * T1_classical = Q\n    T1_classical = Q / 3 = 3 GeV / 3 = 1 GeV.\n\nSo, the classical kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is **T1_classical = 1 GeV**.\n\n### 4. Relativistic Calculation of T1\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, we use the energy-momentum relation: E² = (pc)² + (m*c²)². The total energy is E_total = T + m*c².\n\n1.  Conservation of momentum holds (p1 = p2 = p), so (p1c)² = (p2c)².\n    (p1c)² = E_total1² - E_rest1²\n    (p2c)² = E_total2² - E_rest2²\n    Therefore: E_total1² - E_rest1² = E_total2² - E_rest2²\n\n2.  Energy is also conserved. The initial energy (300 GeV) equals the sum of the total energies of the fragments:\n    E_total1 + E_total2 = 300 GeV.\n\n3.  Rearrange the first equation and substitute E_total1 + E_total2 = 300:\n    E_total1² - E_total2² = E_rest1² - E_rest2²\n    (E_total1 - E_total2)(E_total1 + E_total2) = E_rest1² - E_rest2²\n    (E_total1 - E_total2) * (300 GeV) = (198 GeV)² - (99 GeV)²\n    (E_total1 - E_total2) * 300 = 39204 - 9801 = 29403\n    E_total1 - E_total2 = 29403 / 300 = 98.01 GeV.\n\n4.  Now we have a system of two linear equations:\n    i) E_total1 + E_total2 = 300 GeV\n    ii) E_total1 - E_total2 = 98.01 GeV\n\n5.  Add the two equations to solve for E_total1:\n    2 * E_total1 = 398.01 GeV\n    E_total1 = 199.005 GeV.\n\n6.  The kinetic energy T1 is the total energy minus the rest energy:\n    T1_relativistic = E_total1 - E_rest1 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV.\n\nSo, the relativistic kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is **T1_relativistic = 1.005 GeV**.\n\n### 5. Find the Difference\n\nThe difference is T1_relativistic - T1_classical.\n\n*   Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV.\n\nThe question asks for the answer in MeV. We know that 1 GeV = 1000 MeV.\n\n*   Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV.\n\nTo verify the calculations, let's use a Python script.\n```python\n# Initial rest-mass energy in GeV\nE0 = 300.0\n\n# Calculate fragment rest-mass energies in GeV\n# m1 + m2 = 0.99*M and m1 = 2*m2 => 3*m2 = 0.99*M\n# E_rest2 = 0.33 * E0 and E_rest1 = 0.66 * E0\nE_rest1 = 0.66 * E0\nE_rest2 = 0.33 * E0\n\n# Calculate total kinetic energy (Q-value) in GeV\nQ = E0 - (E_rest1 + E_rest2)\n\n# Calculate classical T1\n# T1_classical = Q / 3\nT1_classical = Q / 3.0\n\n# Calculate relativistic T1\n# We have a system of equations:\n# E_total1 + E_total2 = E0\n# E_total1 - E_total2 = (E_rest1^2 - E_rest2^2) / E0\nE1_minus_E2 = (E_rest1**2 - E_rest2**2) / E0\n# Adding the two equations: 2 * E_total1 = E0 + E1_minus_E2\nE_total1 = (E0 + E1_minus_E2) / 2.0\nT1_relativistic = E_total1 - E_rest1\n\n# Calculate the difference in GeV\ndifference_GeV = T1_relativistic - T1_classical\n\n# Convert the difference to MeV\ndifference_MeV = difference_GeV * 1000\n\nprint(difference_MeV)\n```\n5.0\n<<<C>>>",
    "An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with a rest-mass energy of M*c² = 300 GeV.\nIt undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments, m1 and m2.\n\n### 1. Calculate the properties of the fragments\n\n*   We are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let m1 be the more massive fragment.\n    *   m1 = 2 * m2\n*   The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass M.\n    *   m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M\n*   We can solve for the individual masses in terms of M by substituting the first equation into the second:\n    *   (2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M\n    *   3 * m2 = 0.99 * M\n    *   m2 = 0.33 * M\n*   Now we can find m1:\n    *   m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M\n*   We can now find their rest-mass energies:\n    *   Rest energy of m1: E_rest1 = m1*c² = 0.66 * (M*c²) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV\n    *   Rest energy of m2: E_rest2 = m2*c² = 0.33 * (M*c²) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV\n*   The total energy released as kinetic energy (Q-value) is the initial rest energy minus the final total rest energy:\n    *   Q = (M*c²) - (m1*c² + m2*c²) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)\n    *   Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV\n*   This energy is distributed as kinetic energy to the fragments:\n    *   Q = T1 + T2 = 3 GeV\n\n### 2. Calculate T1 using the Classical Approximation\n\n*   Since the initial nucleus was at rest, by conservation of momentum, the two fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: |p1| = |p2| = p.\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy T is given by T = p² / (2m).\n*   The ratio of the kinetic energies is:\n    *   T1_classical / T2_classical = (p² / (2*m1)) / (p² / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1\n*   Since m1 = 2*m2, the ratio is T1_classical / T2_classical = 1/2.\n*   This implies that T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical.\n*   We also know that T1_classical + T2_classical = Q = 3 GeV.\n*   Substituting T2, we get: T1_classical + 2*T1_classical = 3 GeV.\n*   3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV\n*   **T1_classical = 1 GeV**\n\n### 3. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics\n\n*   Conservation of momentum still holds: |p1| = |p2| = p, so |p1*c| = |p2*c|.\n*   From the relativistic energy-momentum relation E_total² = (p*c)² + (E_rest)², we have (p*c)² = E_total² - E_rest².\n*   Therefore: E_total1² - E_rest1² = E_total2² - E_rest2²\n*   Rearranging gives: E_total1² - E_total2² = E_rest1² - E_rest2²\n*   We can factor the left side: (E_total1 - E_total2) * (E_total1 + E_total2) = E_rest1² - E_rest2²\n*   Conservation of total energy states that the initial energy equals the sum of the total final energies of the fragments: E_total1 + E_total2 = M*c² = 300 GeV.\n*   Now we can substitute the known values:\n    *   (E_total1 - E_total2) * (300 GeV) = (198 GeV)² - (99 GeV)²\n    *   (E_total1 - E_total2) * 300 = 39204 - 9801 = 29403\n    *   E_total1 - E_total2 = 29403 / 300 = 98.01 GeV\n*   We now have a system of two linear equations:\n    1.  E_total1 + E_total2 = 300 GeV\n    2.  E_total1 - E_total2 = 98.01 GeV\n*   Adding the two equations together:\n    *   2 * E_total1 = 300 + 98.01 = 398.01 GeV\n    *   E_total1 = 398.01 / 2 = 199.005 GeV\n*   The relativistic kinetic energy (T1) is the total energy minus the rest energy:\n    *   T1_relativistic = E_total1 - E_rest1 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV\n    *   **T1_relativistic = 1.005 GeV**\n\n### 4. Find the Difference\n\n*   The difference is T1_relativistic - T1_classical.\n*   Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV.\n*   The question asks for the answer in MeV. Since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV:\n*   Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV.\n\n<<<C>>>"
