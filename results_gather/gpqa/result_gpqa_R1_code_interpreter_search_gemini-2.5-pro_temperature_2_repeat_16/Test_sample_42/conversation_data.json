    "Here is a systematic approach to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Description and Draw the Structure\n\nFirst, let's break down the textual description to place the substituents on the benzene ring.\n\n1.  **Parent Structure:** A benzene ring.\n2.  **Highest Priority Group:** The highest priority functional group mentioned is the **carboxylic acid** (-COOH). According to IUPAC rules, this group defines the parent name as **benzoic acid** and the carbon it's attached to is designated as **C1**.\n3.  **Groups meta to each other:** Carboxylic acid (-COOH), carbaldehyde (-CHO, prefix: formyl), and cyano (-CN) are all meta to one another. If -COOH is at C1, the other two must be at C3 and C5.\n4.  **Substituents relative to Carboxylic Acid (C1):**\n    *   A hydroxyl (-OH) group and a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group are *ortho* to the carboxylic acid. This places them at C2 and C6.\n    *   A methoxy (-OCH3) group is *para* to the carboxylic acid. This places it at C4.\n5.  **Final constraint for positioning:** The methoxy group (-OCH3 at C4) and the alcohol/hydroxyl group (-OH) are both *ortho* to the nitrile (cyano, -CN) group.\n    *   \"Ortho to the nitrile\" means the substituents are on adjacent carbons to the carbon with the -CN group.\n    *   Let's test the two possibilities for the positions of -CN and -CHO (C3 and C5).\n        *   **Case A: If -CN is at C3.** The ortho positions to C3 are C2 and C4. The description says the methoxy group (at C4) and the hydroxyl group are here. This fits perfectly, as the hydroxyl group must be at C2 (or C6). Therefore, the -OH group is at C2.\n        *   **Case B: If -CN is at C5.** The ortho positions to C5 are C4 and C6. The description says the methoxy group (at C4) and the hydroxyl group are here. This would place the -OH group at C6.\n\nBoth cases result in valid structures that are mirror images (enantiomers) of each other. However, IUPAC naming conventions will lead to a single, unambiguous name (ignoring stereochemistry, which is not specified). Let's proceed with the structure derived from Case A.\n\nThe resulting substitution pattern is:\n*   **C1:** -COOH (Carboxylic acid)\n*   **C2:** -OH (Hydroxy)\n*   **C3:** -CN (Cyano)\n*   **C4:** -OCH3 (Methoxy)\n*   **C5:** -CHO (Formyl)\n*   **C6:** -N(CH3)2 (Dimethylamino)\n\nThis structure satisfies all the conditions given in the problem description.\n\n### 2. Apply IUPAC Naming Rules\n\n1.  **Parent Name:** As established, it is **benzoic acid**.\n2.  **Numbering:** The carbon with the -COOH group is C1. We must number the ring to give the lowest possible locants to the substituents.\n    *   Numbering **clockwise** gives the locant set: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n    *   Numbering **counter-clockwise** would mean C2 is -N(CH3)2, C3 is -CHO, etc. This also gives the locant set {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n3.  **Tie-Breaking Rule:** When two different numbering schemes produce the same lowest locant set, the tie is broken by giving the lower number to the substituent that comes first alphabetically.\n    *   First, list the substituent prefixes in alphabetical order:\n        1.  **C**yano\n        2.  **D**imethylamino\n        3.  **F**ormyl\n        4.  **H**ydroxy\n        5.  **M**ethoxy\n    *   Now, compare the two numbering directions based on the locant of the first substituent in this list ('cyano').\n        *   **Clockwise numbering:** C1(-COOH), C2(-OH), **C3(-CN)**... 'Cyano' is at position **3**.\n        *   **Counter-clockwise numbering:** C1(-COOH), C2(-N(CH3)2), C3(-CHO), C4(-OCH3), **C5(-CN)**... 'Cyano' is at position **5**.\n    *   Since 3 is lower than 5, the **clockwise** numbering scheme must be used.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Name:** Using the clockwise numbering, we list the substituents alphabetically with their locants, followed by the parent name.\n    *   3-cyano\n    *   6-(dimethylamino)\n    *   5-formyl\n    *   2-hydroxy\n    *   4-methoxy\n    *   ...benzoic acid\n\nCombining them in alphabetical order yields:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n### 3. Compare with Options\n\nLet's check the given options:\n*   A) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - *Incorrect numbering.*\n*   B) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid - *Incorrect alphabetical order of prefixes.*\n*   C) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid - *Incorrect numbering and prefix order.*\n*   D) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - **This matches our derived IUPAC name.**\n\n<<<D>>>"
