    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine its optical activity. A compound is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality are the presence of one or more stereocenters and the overall lack of symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion (i).\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   Structure: Cl-CH=C(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃).\n    *   This is an alkene. To check for chirality, we first look for stereocenters (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups). There are no sp³ hybridized carbons with four different substituents, so there are no stereocenters.\n    *   Molecules without stereocenters can sometimes be chiral (e.g., allenes, atropisomers), but this simple alkene does not fall into those categories.\n    *   The molecule has a plane containing the atoms of the double bond (C1 and C2) and the atoms directly attached to them (Cl, H, the carbon of the methyl group, and the first carbon of the ethyl group). While the entire molecule is not perfectly planar due to the sp³ carbons in the ethyl group, it possesses a conformation with a plane of symmetry that encompasses the Cl, C1, H, C2, and the C-C-C skeleton of the butyl part. Any molecule that can adopt a conformation with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: The compound is **achiral** and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   The IUPAC name itself provides the answer. The descriptors (3aR, 7aS) specify the absolute configuration at two stereocenters, C-3a and C-7a. The (E) describes the geometry of the double bond in the chloromethylene (=CHCl) group.\n    *   Naming a compound with specific R/S descriptors for its stereocenters indicates that the compound is chiral and this name refers to a single, specific enantiomer (or diastereomer). A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is optically active by definition.\n    *   Although some molecules with R and S stereocenters can be achiral (meso compounds), this only occurs if the molecule has an internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. In this complex bicyclic molecule, the two stereocenters, C-3a and C-7a, are in chemically different environments (one is part of an anhydride ring adjacent to two carbonyls, the other is adjacent to a furan-like oxygen). The molecule is inherently asymmetric, and the additional substituent at position 8 further ensures the lack of symmetry.\n    *   Conclusion: The compound is **chiral**, and as a specific stereoisomer is given, it is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   Structure: HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH.\n    *   This molecule has two stereocenters, C2 and C3.\n    *   The substituents on C2 are H, CH₃, COOH, and the -CH(CH₃)COOH group. The substituents on C3 are also H, CH₃, COOH, and the other chiral group. The two stereocenters are constitutionally equivalent.\n    *   This allows for the existence of a meso-compound. The (2R,3S) isomer is indeed the meso form. It has a center of inversion in its stable anti-periplanar conformation, which makes it achiral. In a Fischer projection (eclipsed conformation), it shows a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Conclusion: This is a **meso compound**, which is **achiral** and **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the compound above. The (2R,3R) and (2S,3S) isomers form an enantiomeric pair.\n    *   The (2R,3R) isomer lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is non-superimposable on its mirror image, (2S,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.\n    *   Conclusion: The compound is **chiral** and, as a single enantiomer, is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   The name specifies the (R) configuration, indicating it is a single enantiomer of a chiral compound.\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an alcohol group at C1.\n    *   The carbon atom C1 is a stereocenter. The four different groups attached to it are: -OH, -H, the ring segment -CH₂-CH=, and the other ring segment -CH₂-CH₂-. The two paths around the ring are different because one immediately encounters the double bond.\n    *   The molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   Conclusion: The compound is **chiral** and, as the (R)-enantiomer, is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   This is a cyclohexane with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. There are two possible stereoisomers (diastereomers).\n    *   Isomer 1: All three -OH groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis). This molecule has a three-fold rotational axis (C₃) and three planes of symmetry (σᵥ). Each plane passes through one C-OH group and the opposite C-H on the other side of the ring. Due to the planes of symmetry, this isomer is achiral.\n    *   Isomer 2: Two -OH groups are on one side (cis) and the third is on the other side (trans). This molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the \"trans\" hydroxyl group and bisects the ring. This isomer is also achiral.\n    *   Since all possible stereoisomers of 1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol are achiral, the specific compound named must be achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: The compound is **achiral** and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   Let's determine the structure from the IUPAC name.\n        *   Parent chain: \"butan-1-one\" indicates a four-carbon chain with a ketone functional group at carbon 1. (CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)-)\n        *   Substituents: \"1-cyclopentyl\" means a cyclopentyl group is attached to C1 (the carbonyl carbon). \"3-methyl\" means a methyl group is attached to C3.\n        *   Assembling the structure: CH₃-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl.\n    *   Now, let's search for stereocenters.\n        *   C3 is bonded to a hydrogen atom, the -CH₃ group that is C4 of the chain, the -CH₃ substituent group, and the -CH₂-C(=O)-cyclopentyl group. Since C3 is attached to two identical methyl groups, it is not a stereocenter.\n    *   There are no other stereocenters in the molecule, nor does it possess axial or planar chirality.\n    *   Conclusion: The compound is **achiral** and **optically inactive**.\n\nSummary:\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds among the seven listed.\n\n<<<A>>>"
