    "This is a two-part problem involving the titration of a weak acid (acetic acid) with a strong base (NaOH). We need to calculate the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.\n\n**Part 1: Initial State after Dilution**\n\n1.  **Dilution Calculation**: First, we need to find the concentration of the acetic acid (CH3COOH) solution after it has been diluted with water.\n    *   Initial volume of acetic acid (V1) = 20.00 cm³ = 20.00 mL\n    *   Initial concentration of acetic acid (M1) = 0.05 M\n    *   Volume of water added = 20.00 cm³\n    *   Final volume of the solution (V2) = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 mL\n    *   Using the dilution formula M1V1 = M2V2, we can find the new concentration (M2).\n        *   M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2 = (0.05 M * 20.00 mL) / 40.00 mL = 0.025 M\n    *   So, we are titrating 40.00 mL of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n2.  **Initial Moles of Acetic Acid**:\n    *   Moles = Concentration × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.0400 L = 0.001 mol CH3COOH.\n\n**Part 2: pH at 25% Titration**\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH3COO-). This creates a buffer solution.\n\n1.  **Buffer Composition**:\n    *   Moles of CH3COO- formed = 25% of initial moles of CH3COOH = 0.25 * 0.001 mol = 0.00025 mol.\n    *   Moles of CH3COOH remaining = 75% of initial moles = 0.75 * 0.001 mol = 0.00075 mol.\n\n2.  **Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation**: We can use this equation to find the pH of the buffer.\n    *   pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]), where A⁻ is the conjugate base and HA is the weak acid.\n    *   Since the acid and its conjugate base are in the same volume, we can use the ratio of their moles.\n\n3.  **Calculation**:\n    *   First, calculate pKa from the given Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵.\n        *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n    *   Now, calculate the pH.\n        *   pH = 4.733 + log(moles of CH3COO⁻ / moles of CH3COOH)\n        *   pH = 4.733 + log(0.00025 / 0.00075) = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n        *   pH = 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 ≈ 4.26\n\n**Part 3: pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the initial acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form sodium acetate (CH3COONa). The solution now contains only the conjugate base, acetate, which hydrolyzes water.\n\n1.  **Volume of NaOH added**:\n    *   Moles of NaOH = Moles of CH3COOH = 0.001 mol.\n    *   Volume of NaOH = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 mL.\n\n2.  **Concentration of Acetate (CH3COO⁻)**:\n    *   Total volume = Initial acid volume + Volume of NaOH added = 40.00 mL + 10.00 mL = 50.00 mL = 0.0500 L.\n    *   Moles of CH3COO⁻ formed = 0.001 mol.\n    *   [CH3COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M.\n\n3.  **Hydrolysis of Acetate**: The acetate ion reacts with water to produce OH⁻ ions.\n    *   CH3COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH3COOH + OH⁻\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb.\n        *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰\n\n4.  **Calculating [OH⁻]**: We use an ICE table for the hydrolysis reaction.\n    *   Kb = [CH3COOH][OH⁻] / [CH3COO⁻]\n    *   5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    *   Assuming x is very small compared to 0.02, we get: x² ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ * 0.02 = 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M\n\n5.  **Calculating pH**:\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 = 8.517 ≈ 8.52\n\nLet's use a Python script to verify these calculations.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\n\n# Initial conditions\nC_acid_initial = 0.05  # M\nV_acid_initial = 20.00 # cm3\nV_water = 20.00 # cm3\n\n# Dilution\nV_acid_final = V_acid_initial + V_water # cm3\nC_acid_final = (C_acid_initial * V_acid_initial) / V_acid_final # M\n\n# Titrant\nC_base = 0.1 # M\n\n# Moles of acid to be titrated\nmoles_acid = C_acid_final * (V_acid_final / 1000) # mol\n\n# ----- Part 1: pH at 25% Titration -----\n# Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n# At 25% titration, [A-]/[HA] = 0.25 / 0.75 = 1/3\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\npH_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_25_percent:.2f}\")\n\n\n# ----- Part 2: pH at Equivalence Point -----\n# Volume of base to reach equivalence point\nV_base_equiv = (moles_acid / C_base) * 1000 # mL\n\n# Total volume at equivalence point\nV_total_equiv = V_acid_final + V_base_equiv # mL\n\n# Moles of conjugate base (A-) formed = initial moles of acid\nmoles_A_minus = moles_acid\n\n# Concentration of conjugate base at equivalence point\nC_A_minus_equiv = moles_A_minus / (V_total_equiv / 1000) # M\n\n# Kb for the conjugate base\nKb = Kw / Ka\n\n# [OH-]^2 / [A-] = Kb  =>  [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * [A-])\n# Solving for [OH-] concentration\n# Kb = x^2 / (C_A_minus_equiv - x) --> x^2 + Kb*x - Kb*C_A_minus_equiv = 0\n# Solving quadratic for x = [OH-]\na = 1\nb = Kb\nc = -Kb * C_A_minus_equiv\n# using (-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\nconc_OH = (-b + math.sqrt(b**2 - 4*a*c)) / (2*a)\n\n# pOH and pH\npOH_equiv = -math.log10(conc_OH)\npH_equiv = 14 - pOH_equiv\n\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_equiv:.2f}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\npH at 25% titration: 4.26\npH at equivalence point: 8.52\n</execute_result>\n\nThe manual calculation and the Python script both yield a pH of approximately 4.26 at 25% titration and 8.52 at the equivalence point.

    "**Detailed Step-by-Step Derivations**\n\nThis problem requires us to calculate the pH at two different points during the titration of a diluted weak acid with a strong base.\n\n**1. Initial State after Dilution**\n\n*   First, we determine the concentration of the acetic acid (CH₃COOH) after being diluted.\n*   The initial volume of acetic acid, V₁, is 20.00 cm³ (or 20.00 mL).\n*   The initial concentration of acetic acid, M₁, is 0.05 M.\n*   The volume of water added is 20.00 cm³.\n*   The final volume of the solution, V₂, is V₁ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³.\n*   We use the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂ to find the new concentration, M₂.\n    *   M₂ = (M₁ * V₁) / V₂ = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M.\n*   Next, we calculate the initial number of moles of acetic acid in the 40.00 cm³ solution.\n    *   Moles of CH₃COOH = M₂ * V₂ = 0.025 mol/L * (40.00 / 1000) L = 0.001 mol.\n\n**2. pH at 25% Titration**\n\n*   At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with the NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). This creates a buffer solution containing both the weak acid and its conjugate base.\n*   The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is ideal for calculating the pH of a buffer:\n    *   pH = pKₐ + log([conjugate base]/[weak acid])\n*   First, we calculate the pKₐ from the given Kₐ of 1.85 x 10⁻⁵.\n    *   pKₐ = -log(Kₐ) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   At 25% titration:\n    *   25% of the CH₃COOH has become CH₃COO⁻.\n    *   75% of the CH₃COOH remains unreacted.\n*   The ratio of [conjugate base]/[weak acid] is therefore 0.25 / 0.75 = 1/3.\n*   Now we plug the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    *   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256\n*   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH is **4.26**.\n\n**3. pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n*   At the equivalence point, all the initial moles of acetic acid (0.001 mol) have reacted with an equal number of moles of NaOH. The resulting solution contains 0.001 mol of the conjugate base, sodium acetate (NaCH₃COO).\n*   First, let's find the volume of 0.1 M NaOH required to reach the equivalence point.\n    *   Volume NaOH = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 mL (or 10.00 cm³).\n*   The total volume of the solution at the equivalence point is:\n    *   Total Volume = Initial volume of acid solution + Volume of NaOH added = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ (or 0.050 L).\n*   Now, we can calculate the concentration of the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) in the solution:\n    *   [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n*   The acetate ion is a weak base and will hydrolyze water, creating OH⁻ ions and making the solution basic.\n    *   CH₃COO⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ CH₃COOH(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n*   We need the base dissociation constant (Kₑ) for acetate, which we can find using the ion product of water (Kₑ = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) and the Kₐ of acetic acid.\n    *   Kₑ = Kₑ / Kₐ = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n*   We can now set up an equilibrium expression to find the [OH⁻] concentration. Let x = [OH⁻].\n    *   Kₑ = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻] = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n*   Since Kₑ is very small, we can assume that x is negligible compared to 0.02 M.\n    *   5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ ≈ x² / 0.02\n    *   x² ≈ (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02 = 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] ≈ √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M\n*   Finally, we calculate the pOH and then the pH.\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517\n*   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH is **8.52**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated pH values are 4.26 at 25% titration and 8.52 at the equivalence point. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
