    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. The broadening is due to the varying strengths of these hydrogen bonds.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, which is also characteristic of a carboxylic acid (typically found between 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n\n*   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data confirms the functional group is present in all candidates but doesn't help differentiate them.\n\n**2. Analyze the ¹H NMR Data**\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds with attached protons. All four options are saturated aliphatic carboxylic acids, which is consistent with this information.\n*   **Key Signals:** The most useful information comes from the complex splitting patterns described:\n    *   **Signal 1: doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    *   **Signal 2: doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n\n**3. Understanding the Splitting Patterns**\n\nThe multiplicity of a proton signal is determined by the number of adjacent non-equivalent protons (n) following the n+1 rule. When a proton is coupled to multiple *different* sets of protons, the multiplicities multiply.\n\n*   A **doublet (d)** means the proton is coupled to **1** adjacent proton.\n*   A **triplet (t)** means the proton is coupled to **2** adjacent protons.\n*   A **quartet (q)** means the proton is coupled to **3** adjacent protons.\n\nTherefore:\n*   A **dtq** corresponds to a proton that is simultaneously coupled to three different neighboring groups: one with **1 proton**, one with **2 protons**, and one with **3 protons**.\n*   A **dtt** corresponds to a proton that is simultaneously coupled to three different neighboring groups: one with **1 proton**, one with **2 protons**, and another one with **2 protons**.\n\n**4. Evaluate Each Proposed Structure**\n\nWe need to find the structure that contains one proton environment matching the `dtq` pattern and a different proton environment matching the `dtt` pattern.\n\nLet's start by correctly identifying the IUPAC name for each formula, as this helps in systematic analysis. The parent chain is the longest carbon chain that includes the carboxyl group carbon (C1).\n\n*   **A) `CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH` -> `(CH3)2CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH`**\n    *   Name: **3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**.\n    *   Analysis: The proton at C3 (`-CH(CH3)-`) is coupled to C2-H₂ (2H, triplet), C4-H (1H, doublet), and its own CH₃ (3H, quartet). This gives a **dtq**. However, there is no proton in the molecule that is coupled to two different sets of 2 protons, so there is **no dtt**. Option A is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) `CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH` -> `CH3CH2-CH(Et)-CH(Et)-COOH`**\n    *   Name: **2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**.\n    *   Analysis: The proton at C3 (`-CH(Et)-`) is coupled to C2-H (1H, doublet), C4-H₂ (2H, triplet), and its ethyl's CH₂ (2H, triplet). This gives a **dtt**. However, there is no proton in the molecule coupled to a CH₃ group on an adjacent carbon to produce a quartet, which is a requirement for a `dtq`. Option B is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) `CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH` -> `CH3CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`**\n    *   Name: **2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**.\n    *   Analysis: The proton at C3 (`-CH(CH3)-`) is coupled to C2-H (1H, doublet), C4-H₂ (2H, triplet), and its own CH₃ (3H, quartet). This gives a **dtq**. Similar to option A, there is no proton environment that would produce a `dtt` signal. Option C is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) `CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH`**\n    *   First, we determine the correct structure and name. The formula represents `CH3-CH(Et)-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH`. According to IUPAC rules, we must find the longest carbon chain containing the `COOH` group. That chain is 6 carbons long (`COOH-CH2-CH(Et)-CH(Et)-CH3`, if you trace through one of the ethyl groups).\n    *   Name: **3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**.\n    *   Structure diagram for analysis:\n        `6    5      4       3       2      1`\n        `CH₃--CH₂ -- CH -- CH ----- CH₂ -- COOH`\n                     `|    |`\n                    `CH₃  CH₂CH₃` (Et)\n    *   **Analyze the proton at C4 (H₄):**\n        *   It is a single `CH` proton.\n        *   It is coupled to the two protons on C5 (`CH₂`): multiplicity = triplet (t).\n        *   It is coupled to the single proton on C3 (`CH`): multiplicity = doublet (d).\n        *   It is coupled to the three protons of the methyl group (`CH₃`) attached to it: multiplicity = quartet (q).\n        *   The combined splitting is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first signal.\n    *   **Analyze the proton at C3 (H₃):**\n        *   It is a single `CH` proton.\n        *   It is coupled to the single proton on C4 (`CH`): multiplicity = doublet (d).\n        *   It is coupled to the two protons on C2 (`CH₂`): multiplicity = triplet (t).\n        *   It is coupled to the two protons of its ethyl group's `CH₂`: multiplicity = triplet (t).\n        *   The combined splitting is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second signal.\n\n**Conclusion**\nStructure D, which is correctly named 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid, is the only compound that contains a proton with a `dtq` splitting pattern and another proton with a `dtt` splitting pattern.\n\n<<<D>>>"
