    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer during electrophilic bromination.\n\n### **Step 1: Classify Substituents by Directing Effect**\n\nElectrophilic aromatic substitution is directed by the substituent already present on the benzene ring. We need to classify each substituent as either ortho-, para-directing or meta-directing.\n\n*   **Ortho-, para-directors:** These groups donate electron density to the ring (activating groups) or are halogens. They direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the ortho and para positions. These will produce a high yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) `C6H5-CH3` (-CH3, methyl): Activating, ortho-, para-director.\n    *   5) `C6H5-C2H5` (-C2H5, ethyl): Activating, ortho-, para-director.\n    *   3) `C6H5-Cl` (-Cl, chloro): Deactivating, ortho-, para-director.\n\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups withdraw electron density from the ring (deactivating groups). They direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. These will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   4) `C6H5-NO2` (-NO2, nitro): Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   6) `C6H5-COOH` (-COOH, carboxylic acid): Deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   2) `C6H5-COOC2H5` (-COOC2H5, ethyl ester): Deactivating, meta-director.\n\nBased on this classification, the substances that are meta-directors will have the lowest para-isomer yields and will come first in the ranking. The ortho-, para-directors will have the highest yields and will come last.\n\n**Overall Order:** {2, 4, 6} < {1, 3, 5}\n\n### **Step 2: Rank the Meta-Directors (Compounds 2, 4, 6)**\n\nFor meta-directing groups, the para-isomer is a minor byproduct. The yield of this byproduct is inversely related to how strongly the group deactivates the ring and directs to the meta position. A more powerful deactivating group will lead to an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\nWe need to rank the deactivating strength of the -NO2, -COOH, and -COOC2H5 groups.\n*   **-NO2 (Nitro group):** This is one of the strongest electron-withdrawing and deactivating groups due to both strong inductive and resonance effects. It will produce the least amount of para-isomer.\n*   **-COOH (Carboxyl group):** This is a strong deactivating group.\n*   **-COOC2H5 (Ester group):** This is also a strong deactivating group, but the alkyl part (-C2H5) is weakly electron-donating, which makes the ester group slightly less deactivating than the carboxyl group (-COOH).\n\nThe order of deactivating strength is: **-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5**\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of this:\n**-NO2 < -COOH < -COOC2H5**\nThis corresponds to the compound order: **4 < 6 < 2**\n\n### **Step 3: Rank the Ortho-, Para-Directors (Compounds 1, 3, 5)**\n\nFor ortho-, para-directing groups, the yield of the para-isomer depends on the ratio of para to ortho products. This ratio is governed mainly by steric hindrance and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH3 (1) and -C2H5 (5):** Both are alkyl groups that activate the ring. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased bulk hinders the approach of the electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions, thus increasing the proportion of substitution at the less hindered para position.\n    *   Yield of para-isomer for Ethylbenzene (5) > Toluene (1).\n    *   Approximate para yields: Toluene (~67%), Ethylbenzene (~70%).\n\n*   **Comparing with -Cl (3):** Halogens are a special case. Although they are deactivating overall, they direct ortho and para. Due to their high electronegativity and size, they show a very strong preference for directing to the para position over the ortho position. Chlorobenzene gives a very high yield of the para-isomer compared to alkylbenzenes.\n    *   Approximate para yield for Chlorobenzene (~90%).\n\nSo, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for these three is:\n**-CH3 < -C2H5 < -Cl**\nThis corresponds to the compound order: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\n### **Step 4: Combine the Rankings**\n\nNow we combine the rankings of the two groups:\n*   Meta-directors order: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Ortho-, para-directors order: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThe complete order from lowest para-isomer yield to highest is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
