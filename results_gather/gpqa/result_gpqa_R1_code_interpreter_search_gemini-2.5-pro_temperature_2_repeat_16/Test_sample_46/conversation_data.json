    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula and Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   The formula for calculating the Degree of Unsaturation is:\n    DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\n    where C = # of carbons, H = # of hydrogens, X = # of halogens, N = # of nitrogens.\n*   **Calculation:** DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O), which accounts for the 5th degree.\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum:**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is a classic signature for the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. A secondary amine (-NH-) would only show one band.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption indicates a **carbonyl group (C=O)**. The frequency is in the range for an ester. When an ester is conjugated with a benzene ring, its frequency is lowered slightly, making 1720 cm⁻¹ a very reasonable value for a conjugated ester.\n\n**Summary from IR:** The molecule contains a primary amine (-NH₂) and a conjugated ester group.\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm).\n    *   The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   The difference in chemical shifts indicates that one substituent is electron-donating (shifting its ortho protons upfield towards ~7.0 ppm) and the other is electron-withdrawing (shifting its ortho protons downfield towards ~8.0 ppm). The amino group (-NH₂) is a strong electron-donating group, and a carbonyl group (like in an ester) is a strong electron-withdrawing group. This fits our hypothesis from the IR data.\n\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H) and 1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   This is a classic signature for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   The triplet (t) with 3H at 1.20 ppm corresponds to the methyl (-CH₃) group, which is split by the adjacent 2 protons of the methylene group (n+1 = 2+1 = 3 peaks, a triplet).\n    *   The quartet (q) with 2H at 4.5 ppm corresponds to the methylene (-CH₂) group, which is split by the adjacent 3 protons of the methyl group (n+1 = 3+1 = 4 peaks, a quartet).\n    *   The high chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates the methylene group is attached to a very electronegative atom, which is consistent with the oxygen atom of an **ester group (-O-CH₂CH₃)**.\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   This is a broad singlet (bs) that integrates to 2 protons.\n    *   Broad signals are typical for protons that can undergo chemical exchange, such as those in -OH or -NH groups.\n    *   Given the IR data pointing to a primary amine, this signal corresponds to the two protons of the **-NH₂ group**.\n\n**4. Assemble the Pieces and Evaluate the Options:**\n\nBased on the analysis, we have the following fragments:\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   A primary amine group (-NH₂).\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nAssembling these pieces leads to only one possible structure: the -NH₂ group and the -COOCH₂CH₃ group are attached at the 1 and 4 positions of the benzene ring. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this against the given options:\n\n*   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** (H₂N-Ph-O-CO-CH₂CH₃). The NMR for the ethyl group would show a quartet around 2.5 ppm (next to C=O), not 4.5 ppm (next to O). Incorrect.\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** (H₂NCO-Ph-OCH₂CH₃). The aromatic substitution is 1,3 (meta), which would give a more complex NMR splitting pattern, not two doublets. The IR band at 1720 cm⁻¹ is too high for an amide. Incorrect.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** (CHO-NH-Ph-OCH₂CH₃). This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR, not two. Incorrect.\n*   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** (H₂N-Ph-COOCH₂CH₃). This structure perfectly matches all the data: C₉H₁₁NO₂, a primary amine (-NH₂), a conjugated ethyl ester, and a 1,4-disubstituted aromatic ring. Correct.\n\n<<<D>>>"
