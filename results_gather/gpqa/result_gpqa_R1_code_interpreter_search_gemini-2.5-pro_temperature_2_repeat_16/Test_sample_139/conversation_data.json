    "*   **Step 1: Identify Substance B.**\n    The problem states that substance B has a melting point very close to 277 K.\n    277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n    However, the problem mentions that substance X incorporates a \"heavier isotope\". This suggests we should consider heavy water (D₂O), where D is deuterium, the heavier isotope of hydrogen.\n    The melting point of D₂O is 3.82 °C, which is indeed very close to 277 K.\n    Therefore, Substance B is heavy water, D₂O.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify Substance X.**\n    Since B (D₂O) is produced from X, X must contain deuterium (D). The problem also states that X and its \"very close analog\" are used as reagents in organic chemistry. This points to a common reagent and its deuterated version. Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a very common and powerful reducing agent. Its deuterated analog is Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄). Let's hypothesize that **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Verify the Reaction Chemistry.**\n    Let's check if LiAlD₄ fits the described reaction sequence.\n    *   **Reaction of X with Y:** X (LiAlD₄) reacts violently with liquid Y. Hydride reagents react violently with protic solvents like water. Since the products contain deuterium, the logical choice for Y is D₂O. The reaction is:\n        `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)`\n    *   **Gas W:** The gas produced is D₂. A deuterium atom (D) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule therefore has **2 protons and 2 neutrons**. The number of protons equals the number of neutrons, which perfectly matches the description of gas W.\n    *   **Precipitate G:** The reaction forms aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, which is a solid precipitate. This fits the description of G.\n    *   **Heating G:** When the precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) is heated, it decomposes:\n        `2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O (B)`\n        This reaction releases D₂O, which we identified as substance B. The entire sequence is consistent.\n\n*   **Step 4: Verify the Organic Chemistry Clue.**\n    A keto acid contains both a ketone and a carboxylic acid functional group. LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent that reduces both of these groups to alcohols. The product of the reaction would be a diol, which contains two oxygen atoms. For instance, reducing pyruvic acid (CH₃COCOOH) would yield a deuterated 1,2-propanediol (CH₃CD(OD)CD₂OD), which has two oxygen atoms. This clue further confirms X is LiAlD₄.\n\n*   **Step 5: Calculate the Final Answer.**\n    We have identified substance X as LiAlD₄. The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within it.\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H, as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The **lightest element** (by atomic number, Z) is Hydrogen (Z=1).\n    *   The **heaviest element** (by atomic mass, A) is Aluminum (A ≈ 27 u). (Li has A ≈ 7 u).\n    *   The problem instructs that \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all...must be summed.\" We will use integer mass numbers as the options are integers.\n    *   **Contribution from the heaviest element (Al):** There is one atom of Aluminum. The mass number of its only stable isotope, ²⁷Al, is 27.\n    *   **Contribution from the lightest element (H):** There are four atoms of Hydrogen, all as the isotope Deuterium (D or ²H). The mass number of Deuterium is 2. The total mass is 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Cumulative Mass:** The sum is the mass from Aluminum plus the mass from Deuterium:\n        `Sum = 27 + 8 = 35`\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<D>>>"
