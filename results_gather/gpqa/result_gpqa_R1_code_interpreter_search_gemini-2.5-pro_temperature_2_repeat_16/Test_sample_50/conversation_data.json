    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the net potential energy of the system.\n\n**1. Understand the Physical System and the Method**\n\n*   We have a point charge `q` located at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`.\n*   The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means its electric potential is fixed at zero (`V_sphere = 0`).\n*   The charge `q` induces an opposite charge on the surface of the sphere. This attraction results in a negative potential energy for the system.\n*   To solve this problem, we use the **Method of Images**. This powerful technique allows us to replace the complex induced charge distribution on the sphere with a single, fictitious \"image charge\" `q'` inside the sphere. The electric field and potential *outside* the sphere are the same in both the real system and the image system.\n\n**2. Determine the Image Charge and its Position**\n\nFor a point charge `q` at distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the sphere's effect can be mimicked by an image charge `q'` at a position `b` (distance from the center, along the same line as `q`). The values are:\n\n*   **Image charge magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Image charge position:** `b = R^2 / d`\n\nThis specific `q'` and `b` ensure that the potential on the surface of the sphere (at radius `R`) due to both `q` and `q'` sums to zero, matching the grounded condition.\n\n**3. Calculate the Potential Energy**\n\nThe potential energy `U` of an electrostatic system can be calculated as the work required to assemble it. A general formula for the energy is `U = (1/2) ∫ ρV dτ`, where `ρ` is the charge density and `V` is the potential at the location of that charge (due to all *other* charges).\n\nFor our system of a point charge and a conducting sphere, this formula becomes:\n\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_q + (1/2) * ∫_sphere σ * V_sphere dS`\n\nWhere:\n*   `V_q` is the potential at the location of the point charge `q`, created by the induced charges on the sphere.\n*   `σ` is the surface charge density on the sphere.\n*   `V_sphere` is the potential on the surface of the sphere.\n\nSince the sphere is grounded, `V_sphere = 0`. This makes the second term of the equation zero. Therefore, the total potential energy is simplified to:\n\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_q`\n\n**4. Find the Potential at the Location of the Charge q (`V_q`)**\n\nUsing the method of images, the potential `V_q` created by the induced surface charge is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of `q`.\n\n*   The charge `q` is at distance `d` from the center.\n*   The image charge `q'` is at distance `b = R^2/d` from the center.\n*   The distance between `q` and `q'` is `d - b`.\n\nSo, the potential at the location of `q` due to `q'` is:\n\n`V_q = k * q' / (d - b)`\n\nNow, substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n\n`V_q = k * [-q(R/d)] / [d - (R^2/d)]`\n\nSimplify the denominator:\n\n`d - (R^2/d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\nSubstitute this back into the expression for `V_q`:\n\n`V_q = k * [-q(R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2) / d]`\n\nThe `d` in the numerator's denominator and the denominator's denominator cancel out:\n\n`V_q = - k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Potential Energy**\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for `V_q` back into our simplified energy formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_q`:\n\n`U = (1/2) * q * [ -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThis is the net potential energy of the system. Comparing this result with the given options, it matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
