    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant `kappa` and the renormalizability of the theory.\n\n### **1. Mass Dimensions in Natural Units**\n\nIn high-energy physics, we often use natural units where the reduced Planck constant `ħ` and the speed of light `c` are set to 1 (`ħ = c = 1`). In this system:\n*   Mass, momentum, and energy have dimensions of mass, `[M]`.\n*   Length and time have dimensions of inverse mass, `[M]⁻¹`.\n*   The action `S` is dimensionless, so `[S] = 0`.\n\n### **2. Dimension of the Lagrangian Density (`L`)**\n\nThe action `S` is the integral of the Lagrangian density `L` over four-dimensional spacetime:\n`S = ∫ d⁴x L`\n\nSince the action `S` is dimensionless and the spacetime volume element `d⁴x` has the dimension of (length)⁴, its mass dimension is:\n`[d⁴x] = ([M]⁻¹)⁴ = [M]⁻⁴`\n\nFor the action to be dimensionless, the Lagrangian density `L` must have a mass dimension that cancels `[d⁴x]`.\n`[S] = [L] [d⁴x] = [L] [M]⁻⁴ = [M]⁰`\nTherefore, the mass dimension of the Lagrangian density is `[L] = 4`.\n\n### **3. Dimension of the Fields (`ψ` and `F^{μν}`)**\n\nWe can determine the mass dimensions of the fields by looking at their kinetic terms in the standard model Lagrangian.\n\n*   **Fermion Field (`ψ`)**: The kinetic term for a fermion (like an electron) is `L_fermion = iψ̄γ^μ∂_μψ`.\n    *   `[L_fermion] = [ψ̄][γ^μ][∂_μ][ψ] = 4`.\n    *   The gamma matrices `γ^μ` are dimensionless matrices, so `[γ^μ] = 0`.\n    *   The partial derivative `∂_μ = ∂/∂x^μ` has the dimension of inverse length, so `[∂_μ] = [M]¹`.\n    *   The fields `ψ` and `ψ̄` have the same mass dimension: `[ψ] = [ψ̄]`.\n    *   Substituting these into the dimensional equation: `[ψ] + 0 + 1 + [ψ] = 4` => `2[ψ] = 3` => `[ψ] = 3/2`.\n\n*   **Field Strength Tensor (`F^{μν}`)**: The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is `L_EM = -¼ F_{μν}F^{μν}`.\n    *   `[L_EM] = [F_{μν}][F^{μν}] = 2[F^{μν}] = 4`.\n    *   Therefore, the mass dimension of the field strength tensor is `[F^{μν}] = 2`.\n\n*   **Sigma Tensor (`σ_{μν}`)**: The term `σ_{μν}` is defined as `σ_{μν} = (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]`.\n    *   Since the gamma matrices `γ_μ` and `γ_ν` are dimensionless, their commutator is also dimensionless.\n    *   Thus, `[σ_{μν}] = 0`.\n\n### **4. Dimension of the Coupling Constant (`κ`)**\n\nNow we analyze the given interaction term:\n`L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}`\n\nThe mass dimension of this term must also be 4, just like any other term in the Lagrangian density.\n`[L_int] = [κ][ψ̄][σ_{μν}][ψ][F^{μν}] = 4`\n\nWe substitute the known mass dimensions:\n`[κ] + (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) + 2 = 4`\n`[κ] + 3 + 2 = 4`\n`[κ] + 5 = 4`\n`[κ] = -1`\n\nSo, the mass dimension of `κ` is -1.\n\n### **5. Renormalizability of the Theory**\n\nThe renormalizability of a quantum field theory can be assessed using \"power-counting\". The rule is based on the mass dimension of the coupling constants in the Lagrangian:\n\n*   **Renormalizable**: All coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions (`[g] ≥ 0`).\n*   **Super-renormalizable**: All coupling constants have positive mass dimensions (`[g] > 0`). These theories have a finite number of divergent diagrams.\n*   **Non-renormalizable**: At least one coupling constant has a negative mass dimension (`[g] < 0`).\n\nIn our case, the coupling constant `κ` has a mass dimension of -1. A negative mass dimension implies that as we go to higher orders in perturbation theory (i.e., calculate loop diagrams with more vertices), the divergences become progressively worse. To cancel these new, more severe divergences, an infinite number of counter-terms would be needed, making the theory lose its predictive power.\n\nSince `[κ] = -1`, the theory described by this interaction is **not renormalizable**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   The mass dimension of `κ` is -1.\n*   The theory is not renormalizable.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
