    "*   **Analysis of the Options:**\n    *   **B) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)** and **C) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)** are both quantum field theories (QFTs) that describe fundamental forces. A key feature of calculations in these theories (specifically, those involving loop diagrams) is the appearance of infinities when integrating over all possible energies and momenta of virtual particles. These are called ultraviolet (UV) divergences, corresponding to high-energy/short-distance behavior. To handle these infinities, a procedure called **regularization** is used. This involves temporarily modifying the theory (e.g., by introducing an energy cutoff) to make the integrals finite. Then, through **renormalization**, these cutoff-dependent terms are absorbed into the definitions of physical quantities like mass and charge. Therefore, both QED and QCD fundamentally require regularization.\n    *   **D) Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory also suffers from a high-energy problem. If you consider an electron to be a point particle, its self-energy (the energy of its own electric field) is infinite. This is a classical divergence that arises from integrating the energy density of the field down to a radius of zero. Attempts to solve this problem, for example by assuming the electron has a finite, non-zero size, are a form of regularization. So, Classical Electrodynamics does face divergences at high energies (short distances) that require some sort of ad-hoc fixing.\n    *   **A) Superstring Theory:** One of the primary motivations and most celebrated features of superstring theory is that it is believed to be a UV-finite theory. Unlike in point-particle QFTs, the fundamental objects are one-dimensional strings. The interactions between strings are \"smeared out\" over a region of spacetime, rather than occurring at a single point. This smearing effect smooths out the short-distance behavior that leads to ultraviolet divergences in QFT. As a result, calculations in superstring perturbation theory are expected to yield finite results without the need for regularization and renormalization.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    QED, QCD, and even Classical Electrodynamics encounter infinities related to high-energy (or short-distance) phenomena that must be dealt with by some form of regularization. Superstring theory, by its very construction, is designed to eliminate these divergences, and thus it is the theory that is not expected to require regularization.\n\n<<<A>>>"
