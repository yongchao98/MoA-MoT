    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Conditions:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene molecule with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen) at position 2. All other positions (3, 4, 5, 6) are occupied by standard hydrogen atoms.\n    *   **Reagent/Solvent:** Sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃). NaNH₂ is an extremely strong base (the pKa of its conjugate acid, NH₃, is about 38).\n\n2.  **Recognize the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The reaction of an aryl halide with a very strong base like NaNH₂ proceeds via an **elimination-addition mechanism**, involving a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n3.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of the Benzyne Intermediate)**\n    *   The amide ion (:NH₂⁻) acts as a base and abstracts an acidic proton from the position *ortho* (adjacent) to the leaving group (bromine).\n    *   In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two *ortho* positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n        *   **Position C6:** This position has a hydrogen atom (H).\n        *   **Position C2:** This position has a deuterium atom (D).\n    *   The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond. Due to this **Kinetic Isotope Effect (KIE)**, the abstraction of H from C6 is faster and therefore the major pathway. However, the abstraction of D from C2 is also possible, although it occurs more slowly, and represents a minor pathway.\n    *   Since the question asks for the number of *possible* products, we must consider both pathways.\n\n    *   **Pathway A (Major): Abstraction of H from C6**\n        *   The amide ion removes H⁺ from C6, creating a carbanion.\n        *   This carbanion expels the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n        *   A triple bond forms between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains untouched.\n        *   This forms an unsymmetrical benzyne intermediate: **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n         \n\n    *   **Pathway B (Minor): Abstraction of D from C2**\n        *   The amide ion removes D⁺ from C2.\n        *   This is followed by the expulsion of the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n        *   A triple bond forms between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is eliminated from the molecule.\n        *   This forms a symmetrical benzyne intermediate: **benzyne (C₆H₄)**.\n\n         \n\n4.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    *   The amide ion (:NH₂⁻) now acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the two carbon atoms of the benzyne triple bond. This is followed by protonation from the solvent (NH₃) to form the final product(s).\n\n    *   **Products from Pathway A (via 3-deuterobenzyne):**\n        *   The intermediate, 3-deuterobenzyne, is unsymmetrical. The nucleophile (:NH₂⁻) can attack either C1 or C6.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** The amino group (-NH₂) adds to C1. The resulting carbanion at C6 is protonated by NH₃. The product is **2-deuterioaniline** (amino group at C1, deuterium at C2).\n        *   **Attack at C6:** The amino group (-NH₂) adds to C6. The resulting carbanion at C1 is protonated by NH₃. The product is **3-deuterioaniline** (amino group at C6, deuterium at C2, which is the meta position relative to the amino group).\n        *   These two products are distinct isomers.\n\n    *   **Product from Pathway B (via benzyne):**\n        *   The intermediate, benzyne (C₆H₄), is symmetrical.\n        *   Attack by :NH₂⁻ at either carbon of the triple bond, followed by protonation, leads to only one possible product: **aniline** (C₆H₅NH₂), which contains no deuterium.\n\n5.  **Conclusion: Total Number of Possible Products**\n    *   The major pathway (A) yields two distinct products: 2-deuterioaniline and 3-deuterioaniline.\n    *   The minor pathway (B) yields one product: aniline.\n    *   In total, there are three chemically distinct possible organic products.\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<A>>>"
