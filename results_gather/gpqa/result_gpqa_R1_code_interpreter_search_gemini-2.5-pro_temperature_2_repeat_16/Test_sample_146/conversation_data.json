    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Principle:** The core principle governing this particle annihilation process is the conservation of energy and momentum. Since the problem describes the antiproton as \"slowly moving,\" we can analyze the collision in the center-of-mass frame where both the proton and antiproton are essentially at rest before annihilation. This simplifies the problem significantly.\n\n2.  **Initial State Analysis (Before Annihilation):**\n    *   We have a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    *   Since the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" we assume its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest energy. We can consider both particles to be effectively at rest in the center-of-mass frame.\n    *   The total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n    *   The rest energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.27 \\text{ MeV}$. The antiproton has the same mass, so its rest energy is also $m_{\\bar{p}}c^2 \\approx 938.27 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2$\n    *   $E_{initial} = 2 \\times 938.27 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.54 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   Since the particles are at rest, the total initial momentum is zero.\n\n3.  **Final State Analysis (After Annihilation):**\n    *   The annihilation produces four particles: two $A^{+}$ and two $A^{-}$.\n    *   All four product particles have the same mass, $m_A$, with a rest energy of $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   By conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the four final particles must also be zero. By symmetry, the most straightforward distribution is that all four particles have the same magnitude of momentum and therefore the same kinetic energy and the same speed, which we'll call $v$.\n    *   The total energy of a single moving particle A is given by the relativistic energy formula: $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$.\n    *   The total final energy ($E_{final}$) is the sum of the energies of the four particles:\n    *   $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$.\n\n4.  **Applying Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   We set the initial energy equal to the final energy: $E_{initial} = E_{final}$.\n    *   $2 m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n5.  **Solve for the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):**\n    *   We can simplify the equation and solve for $\\gamma$:\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{2 m_p c^2}{4 m_A c^2} = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 m_A c^2}$\n    *   Now, we plug in the known values:\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{938.27 \\text{ MeV}}{2 \\times 300 \\text{ MeV}} = \\frac{938.27}{600} \\approx 1.5638$\n\n6.  **Solve for the Velocity (v):**\n    *   The velocity $v$ is related to the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ by the formula: $\\beta = v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$.\n    *   We can now calculate $\\beta$:\n    *   $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911} \\approx 0.7688$\n    *   Therefore, the velocity of particle A is $v \\approx 0.7688c$.\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   The calculated value $v \\approx 0.77c$ corresponds to option A.\n\nTo ensure precision, we can perform the calculation using a python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nm_p_c2 = 938.272  # Rest energy of proton in MeV\nm_A_c2 = 300.0   # Rest energy of particle A in MeV\n\n# Total initial energy (E_i = 2 * m_p * c^2)\n# Total final energy (E_f = 4 * gamma * m_A * c^2)\n# E_i = E_f  =>  2 * m_p_c2 = 4 * gamma * m_A_c2\n\n# 1. Solve for the Lorentz factor (gamma)\n# gamma = (2 * m_p_c2) / (4 * m_A_c2)\ngamma = m_p_c2 / (2 * m_A_c2)\n\n# 2. Solve for beta (v/c) from gamma\n# gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2)\n# 1 / gamma^2 = 1 - beta^2\n# beta^2 = 1 - (1 / gamma^2)\n# beta = sqrt(1 - (1 / gamma^2))\nbeta = math.sqrt(1 - (1 / (gamma**2)))\n\n# Print the result for velocity in terms of c\nprint(f\"The velocity of particle A is {beta:.2f}c\")\n```\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The process begins by applying the principle of conservation of energy.\n\n1.  **Initial State Energy ($E_{initial}$):**\n    The problem states that the antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) is slowly moving. This implies its kinetic energy is negligible. Therefore, we can assume the collision happens with both the proton ($p$) and the antiproton at rest. The total initial energy is the sum of their rest energies.\n    The rest mass of a proton is the same as an antiproton, $m_p = m_{\\bar{p}}$.\n    The rest energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.27$ MeV.\n    $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2$\n    $E_{initial} = 2 \\times 938.27 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.54 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n2.  **Final State Energy ($E_{final}$):**\n    The annihilation results in four particles ($2A^{+}$ and $2A^{-}$). All these particles have the same mass, $m_A$, with a rest energy of $m_A c^2 = 300$ MeV.\n    By conservation of momentum (initial momentum is zero), the four resulting particles must move off in such a way that the total final momentum is also zero. By symmetry, they will all have the same speed, $v$, and thus the same total energy.\n    The total energy of a single relativistic particle A is given by $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-(v/c)^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    Since there are four identical particles produced, the total final energy is:\n    $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n3.  **Conservation of Energy:**\n    We set the initial energy equal to the final energy:\n    $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    $2 m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n4.  **Solve for the velocity ($v$):**\n    First, we solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{2 m_p c^2}{4 m_A c^2} = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 m_A c^2}$\n    Plugging in the given values:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{938.27 \\text{ MeV}}{2 \\times 300 \\text{ MeV}} = \\frac{938.27}{600} \\approx 1.5638$\n\n    Now, we use the definition of the Lorentz factor to solve for the velocity, $v$. Let $\\beta = v/c$.\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n    $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n    $1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    Substituting the value of $\\gamma$:\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911} \\approx 0.7688$\n\n    So, the velocity of particle A is $v = \\beta c \\approx 0.77c$.\n\n    Comparing this result to the given options:\n    A) 0.77c\n    B) 0.96c\n    C) 0.86c\n    D) 0.91c\n\nThe calculated velocity matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
