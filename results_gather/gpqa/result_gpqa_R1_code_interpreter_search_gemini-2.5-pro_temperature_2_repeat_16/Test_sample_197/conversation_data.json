    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the percentage of a specific cobalt complex, dithiocyanato cobalt(II) or `[Co(SCN)2]`, relative to the total amount of all cobalt-containing species in the solution. This is equivalent to finding the mole fraction of `[Co(SCN)2]` and multiplying it by 100.\n\n2.  **Identify Species and Equilibria:**\n    In a solution of cobalt(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN⁻) ions, a series of complexation equilibria will be established:\n    *   `Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺`\n    *   `Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂]`\n    *   `Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻`\n    *   `Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n\n3.  **Use the Given Stability Constants (β):**\n    The formation of these complexes is described by overall stability constants (β).\n    *   `β₁ = [[Co(SCN)]⁺] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]) = 9`\n    *   `β₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) = 40`\n    *   `β₃ = [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³) = 63`\n    *   `β₄ = [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴) = 16`\n\n4.  **Define the Mole Fraction (α₂):**\n    The mole fraction of the dithiocyanato complex (`α₂`) is its concentration divided by the total concentration of all cobalt species `c(Co)`.\n    `α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)`\n\n    The total cobalt concentration `c(Co)` is the sum of the concentrations of all cobalt-containing species:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\n5.  **Express Concentrations in Terms of [Co²⁺]:**\n    We can rearrange the stability constant equations to express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co²⁺]` and the free thiocyanate concentration `[SCN⁻]`.\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n\n6.  **Formulate the Mole Fraction Equation:**\n    Substitute these expressions into the equation for `c(Co)`:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n    Factor out `[Co²⁺]`:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n    Now substitute this and the expression for `[[Co(SCN)₂]]` into the mole fraction formula:\n    `α₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n\n    The `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, simplifying the equation significantly:\n    `α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n7.  **Approximate the Ligand Concentration:**\n    The total thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is ten times larger than the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M). This means that even if all the cobalt formed the `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻` complex, it would only consume `4 * 0.01 = 0.04` M of SCN⁻. Since this is less than half the available SCN⁻, we can reasonably approximate the free thiocyanate concentration `[SCN⁻]` to be equal to its initial total concentration.\n    `[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`\n\n8.  **Calculate the Result:**\n    Now, we plug the known values into the simplified `α₂` formula. Let's write a short Python script to perform the calculation accurately.\n\n```python\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nscn_conc = 0.1\n\n# Calculate the individual terms in the denominator\nterm0 = 1\nterm1 = beta1 * scn_conc\nterm2 = beta2 * scn_conc**2\nterm3 = beta3 * scn_conc**3\nterm4 = beta4 * scn_conc**4\n\n# The numerator is term2\nnumerator = term2\n\n# The denominator is the sum of all terms\ndenominator = term0 + term1 + term2 + term3 + term4\n\n# Calculate the mole fraction\nalpha2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert to percentage\npercentage = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(percentage)\n```\n16.916180326482276\n\nThe calculation shows that the mole fraction `α₂` is approximately 0.169, which corresponds to 16.9%.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, in a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN⁻).\n\n**1. Identify the relevant species and equilibria:**\nIn the solution, cobalt(II) ions (`Co²⁺`) react with thiocyanate ions (`SCN⁻`) to form a series of complexes:\n*   `Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺`\n*   `Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂]` (this is the species of interest)\n*   `Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻`\n*   `Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n\n**2. Use the given overall stability constants (β):**\nThe formation of these complexes is described by the following equations:\n*   `[[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]` where `β₁ = 9`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²` where `β₂ = 40`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³` where `β₃ = 63`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴` where `β₄ = 16`\n\n**3. Define the total concentration of cobalt:**\nThe total concentration of all cobalt-containing species, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the free `Co²⁺` ions and all the complexes:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\n**4. Express the total concentration in terms of [Co²⁺]:**\nSubstitute the expressions from step 2 into the equation for `c(Co)`:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\nFactor out `[Co²⁺]`:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**5. Define the mole fraction (α₂) of the desired complex:**\nThe fraction of the dithiocyanato complex, `α₂`, is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration:\n`α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)`\n\nSubstitute the expressions for `[[Co(SCN)₂]]` (from step 2) and `c(Co)` (from step 4):\n`α₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n\nThe `[Co²⁺]` term cancels, simplifying the equation:\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**6. Approximate the free ligand concentration [SCN⁻]:**\nThe initial concentration of thiocyanate (`[SCN⁻]total` = 0.1 M) is ten times greater than the total concentration of cobalt (`c(Co)` = 10⁻² M = 0.01 M). Because the ligand is in significant excess, the amount consumed by complex formation is relatively small. We can therefore approximate the concentration of free thiocyanate ions in equilibrium, `[SCN⁻]`, with its initial total concentration.\n`[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`\n\n**7. Calculate the mole fraction and percentage:**\nNow, we can plug the numerical values into the equation for `α₂`:\n*   `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`\n*   `β₁ = 9`, `β₂ = 40`, `β₃ = 63`, `β₄ = 16`\n\nLet's calculate the numerator and the terms in the denominator:\n*   Numerator: `β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n*   Denominator term 1: `1`\n*   Denominator term 2: `β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n*   Denominator term 3: `β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4`\n*   Denominator term 4: `β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 0.063`\n*   Denominator term 5: `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016`\n\nSum of denominator terms = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\n`α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\nTo get the percentage, multiply `α₂` by 100:\nPercentage = `0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%`\n\nThis matches the value obtained from the code execution `16.916...%`.\n\nThe percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<A>>>"
