    "Here is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical System:** The potential energy is given as $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the potential for a three-dimensional (3D) isotropic harmonic oscillator. The term \"isotropic\" means that the spring constant (and thus the angular frequency $\\omega$) is the same in all three directions.\n\n2.  **Recall the Energy Eigenvalue Formula:** For a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy eigenvalues are quantized and given by the formula:\n    $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega$\n    Here, $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck's constant, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency, and $n$ is the principal quantum number, which can take non-negative integer values: $n = 0, 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$. This principal quantum number is the sum of the quantum numbers for each of the three Cartesian coordinates: $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $n_x, n_y, n_z = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Energy Level for the Third Excited State:**\n    *   The **ground state** is the lowest possible energy state, which corresponds to the smallest value of $n$, so $n=0$.\n    *   The **first excited state** corresponds to the next energy level, so $n=1$.\n    *   The **second excited state** corresponds to $n=2$.\n    *   The **third excited state** corresponds to $n=3$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy of the Third Excited State:**\n    Now, substitute $n=3$ into the energy eigenvalue formula:\n    $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega$\n    $E_3 = (\\frac{6}{2} + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega$\n    $E_3 = \\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega$\n    Looking at the options, we can see that options B and C have this energy value. Options A and D have a different form for the energy which is incorrect for a harmonic oscillator (it looks more like the energy for a particle in a spherical box). So the correct answer must be either B or C.\n\n5.  **Determine the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State:**\n    The degeneracy of an energy level is the number of different quantum states (linearly independent eigenfunctions) that have the same energy. For the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the degeneracy of the energy level $E_n$ is the number of ways we can choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that their sum is $n$.\n    The formula for this degeneracy, $g_n$, is:\n    $g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Degeneracy for n=3:**\n    Substitute $n=3$ into the degeneracy formula:\n    $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2}$\n    $g_3 = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2}$\n    $g_3 = \\frac{20}{2}$\n    $g_3 = 10$\n    So, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the energy $E_3 = \\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n\n7.  **Verification (Optional but recommended):** We can list all possible combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to 3:\n    *   Permutations of (3, 0, 0): (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3) — 3 states\n    *   Permutations of (2, 1, 0): (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2) — 6 states\n    *   The combination (1, 1, 1) — 1 state\n    Total number of states = 3 + 6 + 1 = 10. This confirms our calculation.\n\n8.  **Match the Results with the Options:**\n    *   Energy: $\\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega$\n    *   Number of eigenfunctions (Degeneracy): 10\n    This pair matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
