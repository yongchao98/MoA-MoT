    "This problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and its effect on particle decay.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics of Particle Decay**\n\nThe number of particles, N, that remain after a time 't' from an initial population N₀ is described by the exponential decay law:\nN(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / T)\nwhere T is the mean lifetime of the particle in the frame of reference where time 't' is measured.\n\n**2. Apply Time Dilation**\n\nIn our case, the time 't' is the time it takes for the particle to travel from the center to the detector wall in the lab frame. The lifetime 'T' that must be used in the formula is the particle's lifetime as observed in the lab frame.\n\nAccording to special relativity, a moving particle's lifetime appears longer (dilated) to a stationary observer. This dilated lifetime (T_lab) is related to its proper lifetime (τ, the lifetime in its own rest frame) by the Lorentz factor (γ):\nT_lab = γ * τ\n\n**3. Set up the Equations**\n\nThe time of flight (t_flight) for a particle to reach the detector wall of radius R = 30 m is:\nt_flight = R / v\nSince the particles are ultra-relativistic, their velocity 'v' is approximately the speed of light 'c'.\nSo, t_flight ≈ R / c.\n\nNow, we can write the decay equation for the lab frame:\nN / N₀ = exp(-t_flight / T_lab) = exp(- (R/c) / (γτ) )\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\nN / N₀ = exp(- R / (γcτ) )\n\nNotice that the term R/(cτ) is a constant for this specific type of particle and detector setup. Let's call this constant 'k'.\nk = R / (cτ)\n\nThe equation simplifies to:\nN / N₀ = exp(-k / γ)\n\n**4. Use the Initial Condition to find 'k'**\n\nWe are given that when the Lorentz factor γ₁ = 20, the fraction of surviving particles (N/N₀)₁ is 1/3.\n\n1/3 = exp(-k / 20)\n\nTo solve for 'k', we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\nln(1/3) = -k / 20\n-ln(3) = -k / 20\nk = 20 * ln(3)\n\n**5. Use the Target Condition to find the new Lorentz factor (γ₂) **\n\nNow, we need to find the new Lorentz factor, γ₂, for which the fraction of surviving particles (N/N₀)₂ is 2/3.\n\n2/3 = exp(-k / γ₂)\n\nTake the natural logarithm of both sides:\nln(2/3) = -k / γ₂\nln(2) - ln(3) = -k / γ₂\n-(ln(3) - ln(2)) = -k / γ₂\nln(3/2) = k / γ₂\n\nNow we can solve for γ₂:\nγ₂ = k / ln(3/2)\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Value**\n\nSubstitute the expression for 'k' that we found in step 4:\nγ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)\n\nNow, let's compute this value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the new Lorentz factor using the derived formula\ngamma_2 = (20 * math.log(3)) / math.log(1.5)\n\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 54.18.\n\n**7. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated Lorentz factor is ~54.2. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 40\nB) 68\nC) 54\nD) 28\n\nThe closest answer is 54.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem involves relativistic time dilation and particle decay.\n\n**Step-by-step derivation:**\n\n1.  **Particle Decay Formula:** The fraction of particles (N/N₀) that survive after a time 't' is given by the exponential decay law:\n    N/N₀ = exp(-t / T)\n    where T is the mean lifetime of the particle in the frame of reference where time 't' is measured.\n\n2.  **Lab Frame Quantities:** We are observing the decay from the laboratory frame.\n    *   The time of flight (t_lab) for a particle to travel the detector radius (R = 30 m) is `t_lab = R / v`. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. So, `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n    *   The particle's lifetime in the lab frame (T_lab) is dilated due to its high speed. It is related to its proper lifetime `τ` (its lifetime in its own rest frame) by the Lorentz factor `γ`: `T_lab = γ * τ`.\n\n3.  **Combined Formula:** Substituting these into the decay equation:\n    N/N₀ = exp(-t_lab / T_lab) = exp(-(R/c) / (γτ))\n    We can group the constants for this particle and detector setup: `R`, `c`, and `τ` are all constant. Let's define a constant `A = R / (cτ)`.\n    The formula simplifies to:\n    N/N₀ = exp(-A / γ)\n\n4.  **Use the First Condition:** We are given that for a Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`, the fraction of surviving particles is `(N/N₀)₁ = 1/3`.\n    1/3 = exp(-A / 20)\n    To solve for the constant `A`, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n    ln(1/3) = -A / 20\n    -ln(3) = -A / 20\n    A = 20 * ln(3)\n\n5.  **Use the Second Condition:** We need to find the new Lorentz factor `γ₂` for which the fraction of surviving particles is `(N/N₀)₂ = 2/3`.\n    2/3 = exp(-A / γ₂)\n    Again, take the natural logarithm:\n    ln(2/3) = -A / γ₂\n    -ln(3/2) = -A / γ₂\n    γ₂ = A / ln(3/2)\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Value:** Now substitute the value of `A` we found in the previous step:\n    γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)\n    Using the provided calculation `(20 * math.log(3)) / math.log(1.5)` ≈ 54.19.\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated value of `γ₂ ≈ 54.19` is closest to the option `54`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
