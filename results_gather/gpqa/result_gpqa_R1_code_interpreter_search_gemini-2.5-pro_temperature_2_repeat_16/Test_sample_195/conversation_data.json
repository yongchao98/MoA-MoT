    "Here's the reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n### **1. Identify the Core Physics Principle**\n\nThe problem involves a harmonic oscillator, for which the force is conservative. This means the total energy of the system is conserved. Since the speeds can be relativistic, we must use the principles of special relativity for energy. The core principle is the **Conservation of Total Relativistic Energy**.\n\n### **2. Define the Total Relativistic Energy**\n\nThe total energy ($E_{total}$) of a particle in a potential field is the sum of its relativistic energy and its potential energy.\n\n*   **Relativistic Energy:** The energy of a particle with rest mass $m$ and speed $v$ is given by $E = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor. This energy includes the kinetic energy ($K = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$) and the rest mass energy ($mc^2$).\n*   **Potential Energy:** The force is given by Hooke's Law, $F = -kx$. The potential energy $U(x)$ is found by integrating the force: $U(x) = -\\int F dx = \\int kx dx = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$. We set the potential energy to be zero at the equilibrium position ($x=0$).\n\nCombining these, the total energy of the system at any point ($x, v$) is:\n$E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x) = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\nSince energy is conserved, this quantity remains constant throughout the oscillation.\n\n### **3. Apply Conservation of Energy at Key Points**\n\nTo find the maximum speed ($v_{max}$), we can equate the total energy at two specific points in the oscillation:\n\n*   **Point 1: Maximum Amplitude (x = A)**\n    At the point of maximum displacement (the amplitude $A$), the mass momentarily comes to a stop.\n    *   Position: $x = A$\n    *   Velocity: $v = 0$\n    *   Lorentz Factor: $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$\n    *   Potential Energy: $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n    The total energy at this point is:\n    $E_{total} = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n*   **Point 2: Equilibrium Position (x = 0)**\n    The speed is maximum ($v = v_{max}$) when the mass passes through the equilibrium position, where the potential energy is zero.\n    *   Position: $x = 0$\n    *   Velocity: $v = v_{max}$\n    *   Lorentz Factor: $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n    *   Potential Energy: $U(0) = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$\n    The total energy at this point is:\n    $E_{total} = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} + 0 = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n### **4. Solve for the Maximum Speed (v_max)**\n\nAccording to the principle of conservation of energy, the total energy at Point 1 is equal to the total energy at Point 2:\n\n$mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\nNow, we algebraÃ¯cally solve this equation for $v_{max}$:\n\n1.  Divide both sides by $mc^2$:\n    $1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n2.  Square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n    $\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}$\n\n3.  Take the reciprocal of both sides to isolate the term with $v_{max}$:\n    $\\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2} = 1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$\n\n4.  Rearrange the equation to solve for $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\n5.  Finally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}$\n\n### **5. Conclusion**\n\nThe derived expression matches option C. As a quick check, this formula is physically sound because the term $\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2$ is always greater than 1 (for A > 0), which means the fraction is between 0 and 1, and the entire expression under the square root is between 0 and 1. This ensures that $v_{max}$ is always less than $c$.\n\n<<<C>>>"
