    "This problem requires us to find the value of the normalization constant 'a' for a given wave function.\n\n1.  **The Wave Function and Normalization Principle**\n    The wave function is given by Ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i.\n    In quantum mechanics, the probability of finding a particle in a given region of space is determined by the square of the modulus of its wave function, |Ψ(x)|². The total probability of finding the particle somewhere in all possible space must be equal to 1. This is the normalization condition:\n    ∫ |Ψ(x)|² dx = 1\n    where the integral is taken over the entire region where the particle can exist.\n\n2.  **Determine the Region of Existence**\n    The problem states that the particles are only found between x = 1 and x = 3. This means the integral for the normalization condition must be evaluated from x = 1 to x = 3.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Square of the Modulus |Ψ(x)|²**\n    The wave function is a complex number of the form `z = real + i*imaginary`.\n    *   Real part: Re(Ψ) = a / sqrt(1 + x)\n    *   Imaginary part: Im(Ψ) = -0.5\n    The square of the modulus, |z|², is calculated as (Real part)² + (Imaginary part)².\n    *   |Ψ(x)|² = (a / sqrt(1 + x))² + (-0.5)²\n    *   |Ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\n4.  **Set up and Solve the Normalization Integral**\n    Now we plug |Ψ(x)|² into the normalization equation with the limits from 1 to 3:\n    ∫[from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1\n\n    We can split this into two separate integrals:\n    ∫[from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x)) dx + ∫[from 1 to 3] 0.25 dx = 1\n\n    *   **First integral:**\n        a² * ∫[from 1 to 3] (1 / (1 + x)) dx\n        The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x).\n        = a² * [ln(1 + x)] from 1 to 3\n        = a² * (ln(1 + 3) - ln(1 + 1))\n        = a² * (ln(4) - ln(2))\n        Using the logarithm property ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B):\n        = a² * ln(4/2)\n        = a² * ln(2)\n\n    *   **Second integral:**\n        ∫[from 1 to 3] 0.25 dx\n        = [0.25x] from 1 to 3\n        = 0.25 * (3 - 1)\n        = 0.25 * 2\n        = 0.5\n\n5.  **Solve for 'a'**\n    Combine the results of the integrals:\n    a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\n\n    Now, we solve for 'a':\n    a² * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5\n    a² * ln(2) = 0.5\n    a² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n    a = sqrt(0.5 / ln(2))\n\n    To find the numerical value, we can use a calculator or a simple script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the value of a = sqrt(0.5 / ln(2))\na = math.sqrt(0.5 / math.log(2))\nprint(a)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.8493263919422616\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated value of 'a' is approximately 0.849.

    "The problem asks to find the value of the normalization constant \"a\" for a given wave function Ψ(x).\n\n**1. Understand the Normalization Principle**\nIn quantum mechanics, the probability of finding a particle in a given region of space is given by the integral of the square of the modulus of its wave function, |Ψ(x)|², over that region. The total probability of finding the particle *somewhere* must be 1. This is the normalization condition:\n∫ |Ψ(x)|² dx = 1\nwhere the integral is taken over all space where the particle can exist.\n\n**2. Define the Wave Function and Region**\n*   The wave function is given as: Ψ(x) = (a / √(1 + x)) - 0.5i\n*   The problem states that the particles are only found in the region between x = 1 and x = 3. Therefore, our integral will have the limits of integration from 1 to 3.\n\n**3. Calculate the Square of the Modulus |Ψ(x)|²**\nThe wave function is a complex number. For any complex number z = real + i·imaginary, the square of its modulus is |z|² = (real)² + (imaginary)².\n*   Real part: Re(Ψ) = a / √(1 + x)\n*   Imaginary part: Im(Ψ) = -0.5\n\nSo, the square of the modulus is:\n|Ψ(x)|² = [a / √(1 + x)]² + [-0.5]²\n|Ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\n**4. Set up and Solve the Normalization Integral**\nNow, we apply the normalization condition with the calculated |Ψ(x)|² and the given limits:\n∫[from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1\n\nWe can split the integral into two parts:\n∫[from 1 to 3] [a² / (1 + x)] dx + ∫[from 1 to 3] 0.25 dx = 1\n\n*   **Evaluate the first integral:**\n    a² ∫[from 1 to 3] [1 / (1 + x)] dx\n    The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x).\n    = a² [ln(1 + x)] from 1 to 3\n    = a² [ln(1 + 3) - ln(1 + 1)]\n    = a² [ln(4) - ln(2)]\n    Using the logarithm property ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B):\n    = a² ln(4/2)\n    = a² ln(2)\n\n*   **Evaluate the second integral:**\n    ∫[from 1 to 3] 0.25 dx\n    = [0.25x] from 1 to 3\n    = 0.25(3) - 0.25(1)\n    = 0.75 - 0.25\n    = 0.5\n\n**5. Combine the Results and Solve for 'a'**\nNow, substitute the results back into the equation:\na² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\n\nIsolate the term with 'a':\na² ln(2) = 1 - 0.5\na² ln(2) = 0.5\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\na = √(0.5 / ln(2))\n\n**6. Calculate the Numerical Value**\nUsing the value ln(2) ≈ 0.6931:\na = √(0.5 / 0.6931)\na = √0.7214\na ≈ 0.8493\n\nThis value is very close to the option 0.85.\n\n<<<D>>>"
