    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's dissect the structure:\n*   The parent ring is benzene.\n*   It has three substituents:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    *   A bromine atom (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   All three substituents are in a *meta* relationship to each other (1,3,5-substitution pattern).\n\n### 2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents\n\nUnderstanding how each group directs incoming electrophiles is crucial for planning the synthesis sequence.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Potential Synthetic Strategies\n\nThe goal is to add these three groups in an order that leads to the desired 1,3,5-arrangement with high yield. Friedel-Crafts reactions (like the acylation to add the acetyl group) are sensitive and do not work on strongly deactivated rings (e.g., those bearing a -NO₂ group).\n\nLet's consider the possible orders of substitution:\n\n*   **Strategy 1: Add Bromine first.**\n    *   Benzene + Br₂/FeBr₃ → Bromobenzene. The -Br group is an *o,p*-director.\n    *   Nitration or acetylation of bromobenzene would yield *ortho* and *para* products, not the required *meta* relationship. This strategy fails.\n\n*   **Strategy 2: Add Nitro group first.**\n    *   Benzene + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → Nitrobenzene. The -NO₂ group is a *meta*-director.\n    *   Next, bromination: Nitrobenzene + Br₂/FeBr₃ → 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene (m-bromonitrobenzene). This correctly establishes the meta relationship between Br and NO₂.\n    *   The final step would be to introduce the acetyl group at position 5. This requires a Friedel-Crafts acylation of 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene. However, Friedel-Crafts reactions fail on rings containing a strongly deactivating nitro group. This strategy fails.\n\n*   **Strategy 3: Add Acetyl group first.**\n    *   Benzene + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ → Acetophenone. The -COCH₃ group is a *meta*-director.\n    *   Now we have two choices for the second step: nitration or bromination.\n        *   **Path 3a (Acetylation → Nitration → Bromination):**\n            1.  Acetophenone + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 3-nitroacetophenone. This works well as -COCH₃ directs *meta*.\n            2.  Bromination of 3-nitroacetophenone. The substituents are -COCH₃ (at C1) and -NO₂ (at C3). Both are *meta*-directors. The -COCH₃ group directs the incoming Br to position 5. The -NO₂ group also directs the incoming Br to position 5. Their directing effects reinforce each other, leading to a clean, high-yield synthesis of the desired product, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. This is an excellent synthetic route.\n        *   **Path 3b (Acetylation → Bromination → Nitration):**\n            1.  Acetophenone + Br₂/FeBr₃ → 3-bromoacetophenone. This works well as -COCH₃ directs *meta*.\n            2.  Nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone. The substituents are -COCH₃ (at C1, a *meta*-director) and -Br (at C3, an *o,p*-director). The -COCH₃ group directs nitration to position 5. The -Br group directs nitration to positions 2, 4, and 6. The directing effects are in conflict. In such cases, the *o,p*-director usually controls the outcome, leading to a mixture of products where the desired 5-nitro isomer is a minor component. This is not a \"high-yield\" synthesis.\n\n### 4. Evaluate the Given Options\n\nNow let's examine the options provided in the question in light of our analysis.\n\n*   **A) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ...:** This starts with bromination, leading to *o,p*-products. Incorrect.\n*   **B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ...:** This sequence starts with nitration then reduction to aniline. Step (iii), the Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline, fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group to form a highly deactivated anilinium complex. Incorrect.\n*   **D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂...:** This sequence involves nitration, reduction to aniline, diazotization, and then deamination (reaction with H₃PO₂). This sequence converts benzene to nitrobenzene, then aniline, and finally back to benzene, which is nonsensical. Incorrect.\n*   **C) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...:** This sequence corresponds to **Path 3b** analyzed above (Acetylation → Bromination → Nitration).\n    *   Step (i) gives Acetophenone.\n    *   Step (ii) gives 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    *   Step (iii) involves the nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    As we determined, this step leads to the desired product, although as a minor isomer, making it an inefficient route. However, compared to the other options, it is the only one that presents a chemically plausible (though not optimal) sequence of transformations that can form the target molecule. The subsequent steps (iv to vii) seem extraneous and nonsensical, likely added as distractors. The question asks for a sequence that *would lead* to the product, and the first three steps of option C do, in fact, lead to some of the desired product. The other options are flawed on more fundamental grounds (wrong initial regiochemistry or impossible reactions).\n\nTherefore, despite the low yield in the final step, option C is the \"best\" choice among the given alternatives. It correctly establishes the 1,3-relationship between the acetyl and bromo groups in the first two steps.\n\n<<<C>>>"
