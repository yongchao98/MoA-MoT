    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the initial quantity:** The problem states that \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5\". This describes a distribution, specifically the number of stars found within a small range of parallax. We can write this as a proportionality for the number of stars per unit parallax, `dN/d(plx)`:\n    \n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5` or `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`\n\n2.  **Identify the target quantity:** The question asks how the number of stars changes \"per unit range of distance, r\". This is the number of stars per unit distance, `dN/dr`.\n\n3.  **Relate the variables:** The two variables are parallax (`plx`) and distance (`r`). In astronomy, for small angles, they are inversely related:\n\n    `plx = 1/r`\n    or equivalently,\n    `r = 1/plx`\n\n4.  **Find the relationship between the differentials:** We need to find how `dN/dr` relates to `dN/d(plx)`. We can use the chain rule from calculus:\n\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the derivative `d(plx)/dr`:** We need to differentiate the relationship `plx = 1/r` with respect to `r`:\n\n    `plx = r⁻¹`\n    `d(plx)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n\n6.  **Apply the transformation:** When converting a number distribution from one variable to another, we are interested in the magnitude of the change, not the direction (the negative sign simply means that as distance `r` increases, parallax `plx` decreases). Therefore, we use the absolute value of the derivative, which is often called the Jacobian of the transformation:\n\n    `|d(plx)/dr| = |-1/r²| = 1/r²`\n\n    So the relationship between the distributions is:\n\n    `dN/dr ∝ (dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|`\n\n7.  **Substitute the known proportionalities:** Now, we substitute the expressions we have into this relationship:\n\n    *   `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`\n    *   `|d(plx)/dr| = 1/r²`\n\n    This gives:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (plx⁻⁵) * (1/r²)`\n\n8.  **Express everything in terms of `r`:** The final step is to replace `plx` with its equivalent in terms of `r` (`plx = 1/r`) to get the final answer:\n\n    `dN/dr ∝ ( (1/r)⁻⁵ ) * (1/r²)`\n\n    Recall that `(1/r)⁻⁵ = r⁵`. So:\n\n    `dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (1/r²) = r⁵⁻² = r³`\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe number of stars per unit range of distance, `dN/dr`, is proportional to `r³`.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
