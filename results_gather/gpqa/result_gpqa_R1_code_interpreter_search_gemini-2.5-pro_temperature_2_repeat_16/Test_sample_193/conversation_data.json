    "To solve this problem, we need to find the partition function Z for a system of three spins S1, S2, and S3. Each spin can take the value +1 or -1. The energy of the system is given by the Hamiltonian:\nE = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]\n\nThe partition function Z is defined as the sum over all possible microstates of the system of the Boltzmann factor e^(-βE), where β = 1/(kT).\nZ = Σ_states e^(-βE)\n\nThe system consists of three spins, each with two possible states (+1 or -1). Therefore, there are a total of 2^3 = 8 possible microstates for the system. We need to calculate the energy for each of these states.\n\nLet's list all 8 possible configurations (microstates) for (S1, S2, S3) and calculate their corresponding energies.\n\nLet M = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3, so E = -J * M.\n\n1.  **All spins up:**\n    *   State: (+1, +1, +1)\n    *   M = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n    *   E = -J * (3) = -3J\n    *   Number of such states (degeneracy): 1\n\n2.  **Two spins up, one spin down:**\n    *   States: (+1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, +1), (-1, +1, +1)\n    *   For (+1, +1, -1): M = (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1\n    *   E = -J * (-1) = J\n    *   Due to the symmetry of the Hamiltonian, the other two states in this category have the same energy.\n    *   Number of such states (degeneracy): 3\n\n3.  **One spin up, two spins down:**\n    *   States: (+1, -1, -1), (-1, +1, -1), (-1, -1, +1)\n    *   For (+1, -1, -1): M = (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = -1 - 1 + 1 = -1\n    *   E = -J * (-1) = J\n    *   Again, due to symmetry, the other two states in this category have the same energy.\n    *   Number of such states (degeneracy): 3\n\n4.  **All spins down:**\n    *   State: (-1, -1, -1)\n    *   M = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n    *   E = -J * (3) = -3J\n    *   Number of such states (degeneracy): 1\n\nNow, let's group the states by their energy levels to find the degeneracy of each energy value.\n\n*   **Energy Level E1 = -3J:**\n    *   This energy corresponds to the states (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1).\n    *   The degeneracy is g1 = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n*   **Energy Level E2 = J:**\n    *   This energy corresponds to the states with two spins up and one down (3 states) and one spin up and two down (3 states).\n    *   The degeneracy is g2 = 3 + 3 = 6.\n\nThe total number of states is 2 + 6 = 8, which is correct.\n\nNow we can write the partition function Z by summing the Boltzmann factors for each energy level, multiplied by their degeneracy:\nZ = Σ_i g_i * e^(-βE_i)\nZ = g1 * e^(-βE1) + g2 * e^(-βE2)\nZ = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(J))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\nB) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\nC) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\nD) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\n\nOur calculated partition function Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ) matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
