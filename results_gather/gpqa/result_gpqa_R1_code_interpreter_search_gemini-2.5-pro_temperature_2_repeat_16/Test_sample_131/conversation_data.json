    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **1. Analyze the given ¹H NMR data for the 1:1 mixture**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C₁₀H₁₄.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):**\n    *   There are **two signals**.\n    *   Both are described as **singlets**.\n    *   The integral ratio is **1:1**. This means the total number of protons contributing to the first signal is equal to the total number of protons contributing to the second signal.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):**\n    *   There are **three signals**.\n    *   All three are **singlets**.\n    *   The integral ratio is **2:1:1**. This tells us the relative number of protons contributing to each of the three distinct alkyl signals.\n\n### **2. Analyze the molecular structures and predict the ¹H NMR spectra for each candidate compound**\n\nLet's predict the number of signals, their integration, and multiplicity for each of the four possible compounds.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Formula:** C₁₀H₁₄.\n    *   **Symmetry:** High symmetry (D₂h). It has two perpendicular mirror planes.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C3 and C6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one signal**. Since there are no adjacent protons, this will be a **singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce **one signal**, a **singlet (12H)**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Formula:** C₁₀H₁₄.\n    *   **Symmetry:** Low symmetry. As confirmed by spectral databases, there are distinct environments for its protons.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are in different chemical environments. This gives **two signals**. They are meta-coupled, which is a very small coupling, so they appear as **two singlets (1H each)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** Experimental data shows there are three distinct signals due to accidental chemical shift equivalence of two methyl groups. This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of **6H:3H:3H**, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 3 alkyl singlets (ratio 2:1:1).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Formula:** C₁₀H₁₄.\n    *   **Symmetry:** One mirror plane.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are equivalent. They will produce **one signal**. These protons are adjacent (ortho) to each other, so technically they should form a doublet or an AB quartet. However, it's a single signal representing **2H**. For this problem, we'll consider it \"one signal\".\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1/C4 are equivalent, and the methyl groups at C2/C3 are equivalent. This results in **two signals**. Both are **singlets** with integrations of **6H and 6H** (a 1:1 ratio).\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic signal (2H), 2 alkyl singlets (6H each).\n\n*   **1,4-Diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Formula:** C₁₀H₁₄.\n    *   **Symmetry:** High symmetry (D₂h).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** Four equivalent protons, giving **one signal (4H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The ethyl groups give a **quartet (4H)** for the CH₂ groups and a **triplet (6H)** for the CH₃ groups.\n    *   **Summary:** This compound can be **eliminated immediately** because its alkyl spectrum contains a quartet and a triplet, which contradicts the problem statement that all alkyl signals are singlets. This eliminates option D.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the remaining combinations for a 1:1 mixture**\n\nNow, we check the remaining options by \"adding\" the predicted spectra for a 1:1 mixture.\n\n**A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   **Aromatic:** (1 signal, 2H) + (2 signals, 1H each) → **3 signals**. This does not match the \"two signals\" from the data.\n*   **Alkyl:** (2 signals, 6H each) + (3 signals, 6H:3H:3H) → **Up to 5 signals**. This does not match the \"three signals\" from the data.\n*   **Conclusion:** This option is incorrect.\n\n**B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   **Aromatic:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetra gives 1 signal for 2H.\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetra gives 1 signal for 2H.\n    *   Total: **2 signals**. The integral ratio is 2H:2H, which simplifies to **1:1**. **This is a perfect match.**\n*   **Alkyl:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetra gives 1 signal for 12H.\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetra gives 2 signals, each for 6H.\n    *   Total: **3 signals**. The integral ratio is 12H:6H:6H. Dividing by the smallest value (6H), we get a ratio of **2:1:1**. **This is a perfect match.**\n*   **Conclusion:** This option perfectly matches all aspects of the provided NMR data.\n\n**C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   **Aromatic:** (1 signal, 2H) + (2 signals, 1H each) → **3 signals**. This does not match the \"two signals\" from the data.\n*   **Alkyl:** (1 signal, 12H) + (3 signals, 6H:3H:3H) → **Up to 4 signals**. This does not match the \"three signals\" from the data.\n*   **Conclusion:** This option is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only combination that fits the experimental data is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
