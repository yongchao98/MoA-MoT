    "This question is about the Impulse Approximation (IA) in nuclear physics. Let's break down the meaning of this approximation and evaluate each statement.\n\nThe \"impulse\" approximation is a framework used to describe the scattering of a high-energy probe (like an electron, photon, or neutrino) from a nucleus. The core idea is that the interaction is very rapid and involves a large momentum transfer to a single nucleon. This \"impulsive\" hit happens so fast that we can make several simplifying assumptions. The goal is to describe the complex interaction with the A-nucleon nucleus in terms of a much simpler interaction with a single \"free\" nucleon.\n\nLet's analyze each of the four statements:\n\n1.  **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.** This is the foundational assumption of the IA. It postulates that the incoming probe interacts with only one nucleon at a time. It neglects more complex scenarios like meson-exchange currents or two-body currents, where the probe interacts with a pair of nucleons simultaneously. This assumption is essential to even begin treating the problem as a single-nucleon interaction.\n\n2.  **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.** This addresses what happens *before* and *after* the primary interaction. It assumes that the incoming probe doesn't interact with other nucleons on its way to the target nucleon, and that the outgoing particles (the scattered probe and the ejected nucleon) don't re-interact with the remaining A-1 nucleons on their way out of the nucleus. This neglect of \"initial-state\" and \"final-state interactions\" (FSI) is a crucial step to ensure that the measured final state directly reflects the initial single-nucleon knockout. This approximation is often called the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation (PWIA).\n\n3.  **The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.** This statement concerns the *internal structure* of the nucleon itself. The impulse approximation treats the *nucleon* as the fundamental interacting particle in the nucleus. How the nucleon itself is constructed from quarks and gluons is a separate question of nucleon structure physics. The IA can be applied whether the nucleon is treated as a simple point particle or a complex relativistic system of quarks. Therefore, this assumption is not a prerequisite for the impulse approximation.\n\n4.  **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.** This is the heart of the \"impulse\" concept. The assumption is that the interaction time is extremely short compared to the characteristic time scale of the nucleon's motion within the nucleus (which is determined by the binding forces). Because the interaction is so sudden, the nucleon is struck and ejected before the surrounding nucleons or the average nuclear potential have time to act on it. In that brief instant, it behaves as if it were a free particle, not subject to the binding potential of the nucleus.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nTo make a nucleon in a nucleus \"behave in the same way as a free nucleon\" during a scattering experiment, we need to assume:\n*   The probe hits only one nucleon (**Statement 1**).\n*   The nucleon doesn't feel its binding forces during the brief interaction (**Statement 4**).\n*   The incoming and outgoing particles are not affected by the other nucleons in the nucleus (**Statement 2**).\n\nStatement 3 is about the internal physics of the nucleon, not its behavior within the nucleus, and is therefore not part of the impulse approximation framework.\n\nThus, the assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
