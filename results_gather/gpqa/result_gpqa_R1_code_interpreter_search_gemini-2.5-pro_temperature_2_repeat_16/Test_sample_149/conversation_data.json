    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to identify the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Structure of the Starting Material**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula for DBE is C - H/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    DBE = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional degree of unsaturation (a double bond or another ring).\n\n*   **1H-NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). A triplet (t) indicates that it is coupled to two adjacent protons (n+1 rule), which implies a -CH2- group is next to it. So, we have a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to two protons, are a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is typical for a primary amine (-NH2). The broadness is due to rapid proton exchange and quadrupolar relaxation.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a CH2 group. A doublet (d) indicates it's coupled to one adjacent proton, which is consistent with the aldehyde proton in the -CH2-CHO fragment.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   The two substituents are an amino group (-NH2) and an acetaldehyde group (-CH2CHO).\n    *   Let's check if the formula matches: C6H4 (from the ring) + NH2 + C2H3O = C8H(4+2+3)NO = C8H9NO. The formula is correct.\n    *   Therefore, the starting material is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde\n\n*   **Reaction 1 & 2: 1. NaNO2 + HCl; 2. H2O**\n    1.  **Diazotization:** The reagents NaNO2 and HCl at low temperature react with the primary aromatic amine (-NH2) to form a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n    2.  **Hydrolysis:** The addition of water (often with warming) to the diazonium salt results in the substitution of the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group (-OH). This is a standard method to synthesize phenols.\n\n    The intermediate product after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n    ```\n         HO-Ph-CH2-CHO  (where Ph is a 1,4-phenylene group)\n    ```\n\n*   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   We are now treating an aldehyde (4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde) that possesses α-hydrogens (the protons on the -CH2- group) with a strong base (KOH) and heat. These are the classic conditions for an **Aldol Condensation**.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        a.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH-) removes an acidic α-hydrogen from one molecule of the aldehyde to form an enolate ion.\n        b.  **Nucleophilic Attack (Aldol Addition):** The enolate ion acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of the aldehyde. After protonation, this forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is the aldol addition product.\n            The structure of the aldol addition product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This corresponds to option (C).\n            ```\n                                    CHO\n                                    |\n            HO-Ph-CH2-CH(OH)-CH-Ph-OH\n            ```\n        c.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of **heat** promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. The hydroxyl group from the β-carbon (C3) and a proton from the α-carbon (C2) are removed, forming a double bond between the α and β carbons. This dehydration step is called condensation.\n\n    The formation of the C=C double bond creates a conjugated system (α,β-unsaturated aldehyde), which is thermodynamically stable and favored by heat.\n    The final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This corresponds to option (D).\n    ```\n                           CHO\n                           |\n       HO-Ph-CH2-CH=C-Ph-OH\n    ```\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion**\n\nThe question asks for the **final product** of the entire reaction sequence. While the aldol addition product (C) is a key intermediate, the \"Heat\" condition in the final step drives the reaction forward to the dehydrated condensation product (D). Therefore, 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal is the final major product.\n\nFinal Answer Comparison:\n*   A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal: Incorrect functional groups and structure.\n*   B) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal: Incorrect structure, only one aromatic ring.\n*   C) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal: This is the aldol *addition* product, which is an intermediate.\n*   D) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal: This is the aldol *condensation* product, the final product formed upon heating.\n\n<<<D>>>"
