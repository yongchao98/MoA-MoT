    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactant**\n\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down its structure to find its molecular formula.\n\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: This is a six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbon 3 and carbon 4.\n*   **carboxylic acid**: This is the principal functional group (-COOH), so it is attached to carbon 1.\n*   **2-formyl**: An aldehyde group (-CHO) is attached to carbon 2.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) is attached to carbon 5.\n\nLet's determine the molecular formula by counting the atoms:\n*   **Carbon (C):**\n    *   6 carbons in the cyclohexene ring.\n    *   1 carbon in the carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   1 carbon in the formyl group (-CHO).\n    *   2 carbons in the vinyl group (-CH=CH₂).\n    *   Total carbons = 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):**\n    *   On the ring: C1(1H), C2(1H), C3(1H), C4(1H), C5(1H), C6(2H) -> Total 7 H.\n    *   In the functional groups: -COOH(1H), -CHO(1H), -CH=CH₂(3H) -> Total 5 H.\n    *   Total hydrogens = 7 + 5 = 12.\n*   **Oxygen (O):**\n    *   2 oxygens in the carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   1 oxygen in the formyl group (-CHO).\n    *   Total oxygens = 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nThe molecular formula of the starting material is **C₁₀H₁₂O₃**.\n\nWe can calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the reactant to verify the structure:\nIHD = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1\nIHD = 10 - 12/2 + 0/2 + 1 = 10 - 6 + 1 = 5.\nLet's check this against the structure: 1 ring (IHD=1), 1 C=C in the ring (IHD=1), 1 C=C in the vinyl group (IHD=1), 1 C=O in the formyl group (IHD=1), 1 C=O in the carboxylic acid group (IHD=1). Total IHD = 1+1+1+1+1 = 5. The structure is correct.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess hydroiodic acid (HI)**. This is a very powerful reducing agent combination in organic chemistry. It performs exhaustive reduction of many functional groups. Specifically, it will:\n*   Reduce aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) completely to alkyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   Reduce carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n\n**3. Determine the Product**\n\nApplying the effects of Red P + HI to the starting material:\n*   The **cyclohex-3-ene** ring will be reduced to a **cyclohexane** ring (the C=C becomes a C-C single bond).\n*   The **carboxylic acid group** (-COOH) at position 1 will be reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n*   The **formyl group** (-CHO) at position 2 will be reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n*   The **vinyl group** (-CH=CH₂) at position 5 will be reduced to an **ethyl group** (-CH₂CH₃).\n\nThe product is a trisubstituted cyclohexane. Let's determine its molecular formula:\n*   **Carbon (C):** The number of carbon atoms remains the same. The product has **10 carbon atoms**.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** Since the product is a saturated cycloalkane (a monocyclic alkane), its general formula is CₙH₂ₙ. With n=10, the formula is **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** All oxygen atoms are removed during the reduction (they end up in water molecules).\n\nThe final product is **C₁₀H₂₀** (which is some isomer of ethyl-dimethylcyclohexane, e.g., 4-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane).\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe IHD is a measure of the number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule. We can calculate it using the molecular formula of the product, C₁₀H₂₀.\n\nThe formula for IHD is:\nIHD = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1\nFor the product C₁₀H₂₀:\nIHD = 10 - (20/2) + 0/2 + 1\nIHD = 10 - 10 + 1\nIHD = 1\n\nAlternatively, we can determine the IHD by inspecting the structure of the product. The product is a substituted cyclohexane.\n*   Number of rings = 1\n*   Number of pi bonds (double or triple bonds) = 0\nTotal IHD = Number of rings + Number of pi bonds = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nBoth methods yield an IHD of 1 for the product.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained from the reaction is 1. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 0\nB) 1\nC) 5\nD) 3\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n```python\n# Python code to verify the IHD calculation for the product.\ndef calculate_ihd(carbons, hydrogens, halogens=0, nitrogens=0):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (also known as degrees of unsaturation).\n    \"\"\"\n    return carbons - (hydrogens / 2) - (halogens / 2) + (nitrogens / 2) + 1\n\n# Molecular formula of the final product is C10H20.\ncarbons_product = 10\nhydrogens_product = 20\n\n# Calculate the IHD of the product\nihd_product = calculate_ihd(carbons_product, hydrogens_product)\n\nprint(f\"The molecular formula of the product is C10H20.\")\nprint(f\"The index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is: {int(ihd_product)}\")\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The final product is C10H20. The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) is calculated using the formula: IHD = C - H/2 + 1. For C10H20, the IHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1 = 10 - 10 + 1 = 1. This IHD of 1 is due to the single ring present in the cyclohexane structure of the product.\n<<<B>>>"
