    "SMEFT, the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, is constructed as an extension of the Standard Model (SM). It incorporates the principles of quantum field theory and the known symmetries of the SM, while allowing for new physics to appear at a high energy scale, Λ. Let's analyze each of the proposed symmetries:\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry**: The Standard Model is a relativistic quantum field theory, meaning it is fundamentally based on the principles of special relativity. A core tenet of this is Lorentz invariance—the laws of physics are the same for all inertial observers. SMEFT is constructed as a Lorentz-invariant theory. The operators added in SMEFT are formed from Lorentz-covariant fields (scalars, spinors, vectors) and their derivatives, combined in a way that the resulting Lagrangian term is a Lorentz scalar. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry **must** be respected.\n\n2.  **Poincare symmetry**: Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry (rotations and boosts) plus spacetime translations. Any local quantum field theory that is Lorentz-invariant, like the Standard Model and SMEFT, is also constructed to be invariant under translations. Therefore, Poincare symmetry **must** be respected.\n\n3.  **CP symmetry**: CP symmetry is the combination of Charge Conjugation (C) and Parity (P). It is well-established that the weak interaction within the Standard Model violates CP symmetry (e.g., in the CKM matrix). SMEFT is designed to parameterize all possible effects of new physics, including potentially new sources of CP violation beyond the SM. Therefore, there is no requirement for SMEFT operators to respect CP symmetry. In fact, classifying operators as CP-even or CP-odd is a crucial part of SMEFT phenomenology. So, CP symmetry **is not** a required symmetry.\n\n4.  **CPT symmetry**: The CPT theorem is a cornerstone of quantum field theory. It states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be invariant under the combined transformation of CPT (Charge, Parity, and Time reversal). Since SMEFT is constructed as a local and Lorentz-invariant theory, the CPT theorem applies. Thus, the total Lagrangian, including all SMEFT operators, **must** respect CPT symmetry. While theories exploring CPT violation exist (like the \"Standard Model Extension\" or SME), the standard SMEFT framework assumes CPT invariance.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincare symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). CP symmetry (3) is not a required symmetry.\n\nTherefore, the correct combination is 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
