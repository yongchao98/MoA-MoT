    "An electric dipole transition involves the emission or absorption of a single photon. For a multi-photon process, like the two-dipole transition described here, the atom transitions through an intermediate state. The rules governing which transitions are allowed are called selection rules.\n\n### 1. Understanding Dipole Selection Rules\n\nFor an electric dipole transition in a hydrogen-like atom from a state `|n, l, m>` to `|n', l', m'>`, the following selection rules must be obeyed:\n1.  The orbital angular momentum quantum number `l` must change by ±1: `Δl = l' - l = ±1`.\n2.  The magnetic quantum number `m` must change by 0 or ±1: `Δm = m' - m = 0, ±1`.\n3.  The principal quantum number `n` can change by any integer value (`Δn` is unrestricted), though transitions to lower energy levels (lower `n`) are spontaneous.\n\n### 2. Analyzing the Transition Path\n\nThe atom starts in the initial state `|3, 0, 0>` and decays to the final state `|1, 0, 0>` via a two-step process involving an intermediate state `|n_int, l_int, m_int>`.\n\n**Step 1: |3, 0, 0> → |n_int, l_int, m_int>**\n\n*   **Initial State:** `n=3, l=0, m=0`.\n*   **Applying selection rules:**\n    *   `Δl = l_int - 0 = ±1`  => `l_int = 1`.\n    *   `Δm = m_int - 0 = 0, ±1` => `m_int` can be `-1, 0, 1`.\n*   The principal quantum number of the intermediate state, `n_int`, must be different from the initial state `n=3`. Typically, this is a decay process, so `n_int < 3`. All the options suggest `n_int = 2`, which is a valid energy-lowering transition.\n*   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are `|2, 1, -1>`, `|2, 1, 0>`, and `|2, 1, 1>`.\n\n**Step 2: |n_int, l_int, m_int> → |1, 0, 0>**\n\n*   **Final State:** `n'=1, l'=0, m'=0`.\n*   **Applying selection rules to the intermediate states:**\n    *   `Δl = l_f - l_int = 0 - 1 = -1`. This satisfies the `Δl=±1` rule.\n    *   `Δm = m_f - m_int = 0 - m_int`. For this to be `0` or `±1`, `m_int` must be `0` or `±1`, which is consistent with our findings from Step 1.\n\nSo, all three pathways are possible according to the selection rules:\n*   `|3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0>`\n*   `|3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>`\n*   `|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0>`\n\nThis matches the routes given in options A, B, C, and D. To distinguish between them, we must calculate the probabilities of these routes.\n\n### 3. Calculating Transition Probabilities\n\nThe probability of a given transition pathway is the product of the probabilities of each step in the path. The probability of each step is proportional to the square of the transition matrix element. Using the Wigner-Eckart theorem, this probability is proportional to the square of the relevant Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.\n\nLet's calculate the relative probabilities for the two steps.\n\n**Step 1: Relative probabilities for |3, 0, 0> → |2, 1, m_int>**\n\nThe initial state `|3, 0, 0>` has `l=0, m=0` (spherically symmetric). When it decays via a dipole transition (`l=1` operator), there is no preferred direction. Therefore, the resulting `m_int` states (`-1, 0, 1`) are populated equally.\n*   Probability `P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,1>) ∝ 1`\n*   Probability `P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) ∝ 1`\n*   Probability `P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>) ∝ 1`\n\nSince there are three equally likely outcomes, the probability of the atom transitioning into any *specific* intermediate state `m_int` is 1/3.\n*   `P(m_int = 1) = 1/3`\n*   `P(m_int = 0) = 1/3`\n*   `P(m_int = -1) = 1/3`\n\n**Step 2: Probabilities for |2, 1, m_int> → |1, 0, 0>**\n\nThis is the decay of the `2p` state. The atom in the intermediate state `|2, 1, m_int>` will decay to the ground state `|1, 0, 0>`. Since this is the only allowed decay path for a `2p` state (`2p → 1s`), the probability of this second step occurring, given the atom is in any of the `|2, 1, m_int>` states, is 1.\n*   `P(|2,1,1> → |1,0,0>) = 1`\n*   `P(|2,1,0> → |1,0,0>) = 1`\n*   `P(|2,1,-1> → |1,0,0>) = 1`\n\n### 4. Overall Route Probability\n\nThe probability of a total route is the probability of the first step multiplied by the probability of the second step.\n\n*   **For the route |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>:**\n    *   Probability = `P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) × P(|2,1,0> → |1,0,0>)`\n    *   Probability = `(1/3) × 1 = 1/3`\n\n*   **For the other two routes:**\n    *   `P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0>) = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3`\n    *   `P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0>) = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3`\n\nTherefore, the specific route `|3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>` has a probability of 1/3. Let's compare this with the given options:\n\n*   A) |3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and \\frac{1}{4} (Incorrect probability)\n*   B) |3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and \\frac{1}{4} (Incorrect probability)\n*   C) |3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and \\frac{2}{3} (Incorrect probability)\n*   D) |3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle and \\frac{1}{3} (Correct route and probability)\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{D}$."
