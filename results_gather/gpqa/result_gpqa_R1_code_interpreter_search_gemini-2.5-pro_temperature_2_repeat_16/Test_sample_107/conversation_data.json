    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Paramagnetic Coupling Term**\n\nThe paramagnetic coupling term describes the energy of interaction between an atom's orbital magnetic moment and an external magnetic field. This is a manifestation of the Zeeman effect. The interaction Hamiltonian is given by:\n\n$H_p = -\\vec{\\mu}_L \\cdot \\vec{B}$\n\nwhere:\n*   $\\vec{\\mu}_L$ is the orbital magnetic moment of the electron.\n*   $\\vec{B}$ is the external magnetic field.\n\nThe orbital magnetic moment is related to the orbital angular momentum $\\vec{L}$ by:\n\n$\\vec{\\mu}_L = -\\frac{e}{2m_e}\\vec{L}$\n\nwhere $e$ is the elementary charge and $m_e$ is the electron mass.\n\nSubstituting this into the Hamiltonian expression, we get:\n\n$H_p = \\frac{e}{2m_e}(\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B})$\n\nThe problem states that the magnetic field is parallel to the z-axis, so $\\vec{B} = B\\hat{k}$. The dot product simplifies to:\n\n$\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B} = L_z B$\n\nThe energy contribution is the expectation value of this Hamiltonian, which for a state with a definite magnetic quantum number *m* is:\n\n$\\left\\langle H_p\\right\\rangle = \\frac{e B}{2m_e}\\left\\langle L_z\\right\\rangle$\n\nThe eigenvalue of the z-component of angular momentum, $L_z$, is $m\\hbar$, where *m* is the orbital magnetic quantum number and $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n$\\left\\langle H_p\\right\\rangle = \\frac{e \\hbar}{2m_e} m B$\n\nThe term $\\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e}$ is a fundamental constant known as the **Bohr magneton**, denoted by $\\mu_B$. So the final expression for the energy is:\n\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = m \\mu_B B$\n\n### **2. Calculate the Paramagnetic Coupling Energy**\n\nWe are given the following values:\n*   **Magnetic field**, $B = 1$ T.\n*   **Orbital magnetic quantum number**, *m*, is small. We will use $m=1$ as a representative small, non-zero integer value.\n*   The value of the **Bohr magneton**, $\\mu_B = 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J/T}$.\n\nNow, we calculate the energy:\n\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = (1) \\times (9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J/T}) \\times (1 \\text{ T}) = 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J}$\n\n### **3. Calculate the Transition Energy $\\Delta E$**\n\nThe energy of a photon corresponding to an atomic transition is related to its wavelength $\\lambda$ by the formula:\n\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$\n\nwhere:\n*   $h$ is the Planck constant ($6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J·s}$).\n*   $c$ is the speed of light ($3.00 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}$).\n*   $\\lambda$ is the given wavelength, $0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m} = 0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$.\n\nLet's calculate the transition energy:\n\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J·s}) \\times (3.00 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s})}{0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}} \\approx 4.089 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}$\n\n### **4. Compare the Magnitudes**\n\nNow we compare the two calculated energies:\n*   Paramagnetic coupling energy: $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J}$\n*   Transition energy: $\\Delta E = 4.089 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}$\n\nLet's find the ratio:\n\n$\\frac{\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J}}{4.089 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5}$\n\nThe ratio is on the order of $10^{-5}$, which is a very small number. This clearly indicates that the paramagnetic coupling energy is very small compared to the electronic transition energy.\n\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll \\Delta E$\n\nTherefore, the correct relationship between the two energies is that the paramagnetic coupling term is much, much less than the transition energy. This is a general result in atomic physics: Zeeman splitting energies are typically much smaller than the energy differences between principal electronic levels.\n\nTo confirm the precision of the calculations, we can use a Python script.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Constants\nh = 6.62607015e-34  # Planck constant in J·s\nc = 299792458      # Speed of light in m/s\nmu_B = 9.2740100783e-24 # Bohr magneton in J/T\n\n# Given values\nm = 1              # Small orbital magnetic quantum number\nB = 1.0            # Magnetic field in T\nlambda_m = 0.4861e-6 # Wavelength in meters\n\n# --- Calculations ---\n\n# 1.

    "The paramagnetic coupling energy, also known as the Zeeman energy, for an atom in a magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ is given by the Hamiltonian $H_p = -\\vec{\\mu}_L \\cdot \\vec{B}$. The orbital magnetic moment is $\\vec{\\mu}_L = -\\frac{e}{2m_e}\\vec{L}$, where $\\vec{L}$ is the orbital angular momentum.\n\nSo, the Hamiltonian becomes:\n$H_p = \\frac{e}{2m_e}\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B}$\n\nGiven that the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ is parallel to the z-axis, $\\vec{B} = B\\hat{k}$.
