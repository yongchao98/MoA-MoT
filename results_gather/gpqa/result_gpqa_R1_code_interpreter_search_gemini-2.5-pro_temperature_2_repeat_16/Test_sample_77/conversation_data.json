    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.\n\n### **1. Identifying the Physics Problem**\n\nThe question asks for the scalar potential (V) and the vector potential (A) generated by a point charge `q` moving along a trajectory `s(t)`. The potentials are to be found at a specific observation point `r` and time `t`. This is a classic problem in electrodynamics, and the solutions are known as the **Liénard-Wiechert potentials**.\n\n### **2. The Concept of Retarded Time**\n\nUnlike in electrostatics, where fields are considered to be established instantaneously, in electrodynamics, electromagnetic disturbances (fields) propagate at the speed of light, `c`. This means that the field observed at point `r` at time `t` was actually generated by the charge at an *earlier* time, called the **retarded time**, `tr`.\n\n*   The charge was at a position `s(tr)` at this retarded time `tr`.\n*   The field then traveled from `s(tr)` to `r`.\n*   The distance of travel is `d = |r - s(tr)|`.\n*   The time taken for this travel is `d / c`.\n\nTherefore, the retarded time `tr` is implicitly defined by the relation:\n`t = tr + d / c`\nor\n`t - tr = |r - s(tr)| / c`\n\n### **3. Deriving the Liénard-Wiechert Potentials (Conceptual)**\n\nThe Liénard-Wiechert potentials are derived from the general retarded potential formulas for continuous charge (`ρ`) and current (`J`) densities:\n\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [ρ(r', tr') / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [J(r', tr') / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n\nwhere `tr' = t - |r - r'| / c`.\n\nFor a point charge, the densities are expressed using Dirac delta functions:\n*   `ρ(r', t') = q * δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n*   `J(r', t') = q * v(t') * δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n\nSubstituting these into the integrals and evaluating them is a non-trivial process because the retarded time `tr'` inside the delta function depends on the integration variable `r'`. The result of this integration yields the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### **4. The Standard Forms of Liénard-Wiechert Potentials**\n\nThe standard, well-established results of this integration are:\n\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (d - d · v / c)]_ret`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q * v / (d - d · v / c)]_ret`\n\nHere:\n*   The subscript `_ret` signifies that all quantities inside the brackets (`d`, `v`) are evaluated at the **retarded time `tr`**.\n*   `q` is the charge of the point particle.\n*   `d` is the vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point: `d = r - s(tr)`.\n*   `d` is the magnitude of this vector: `d = |d| = |r - s(tr)|`.\n*   `v` is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time: `v = s'(tr)`.\n\n### **5. Manipulating the Formula to Match the Options**\n\nLet's take the denominator from the standard formula and rearrange it:\nDenominator = `d - (d · v / c)`\n\nTo make it look like the options, let's find a common denominator:\nDenominator = `(dc / c) - (d · v / c) = (dc - d · v) / c`\n\nNow, substitute this back into the expression for the scalar potential `V`:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / ((dc - d · v) / c)]`\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [qc / (dc - d · v)]`\n\nDo the same for the vector potential `A`:\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q * v / ((dc - d · v) / c)]`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [qc * v / (dc - d · v)]`\n\n### **6. Comparing with the Given Options**\n\nNow, let's compare our derived expressions with the choices provided:\n\n*   **A)** `V(r,t) = (qc / 4πε₀(dc + d · v))`, `A(r,t) = (μ qc v / 4π(dc + d · v))`\n    *   Incorrect. The sign in the denominator is a plus (`+`) instead of a minus (`-`).\n\n*   **B)** `V(r,t) = q / (4πε₀r)`, `A(r,t) = (v² / c²) V(r,t)`\n    *   Incorrect. This uses the simple electrostatic potential, which doesn't account for retardation effects. `r` is the distance to the origin, not the retarded distance `d`.\n\n*   **C)** `V(r,t) = q / (4πε₀r)`, `A(r,t) = (v / c²) V(r,t)`\n    *   Incorrect. Same reason as B; it uses the static potential. While the relation `A = (v/c²)V` is correct for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the expression for `V` itself is wrong.\n\n*   **D)** `V(r,t) = (qc / 4πε₀(dc - d · v))`, `A(r,t) = (μ₀ qc v / 4π(dc - d · v))`\n    *   **This is a perfect match.** The expression for `V` is correct. The expression for `A` is also correct, using `μ_o` as stated in the problem's variable list.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge, in the notation given, are those provided in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
