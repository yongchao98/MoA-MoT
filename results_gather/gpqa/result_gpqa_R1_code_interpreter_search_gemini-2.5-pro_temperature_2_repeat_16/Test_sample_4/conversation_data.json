    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the operators:**\n    The problem defines the components of the operator $\\vec{P}$ as:\n    $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    These are the spin angular momentum operators for a spin-1/2 particle (like a muon), where the matrices are the Pauli matrices $\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$. So, $\\vec{P}$ is the spin operator $\\vec{S}$.\n\n2.  **Define the direction vector:**\n    The problem asks for the eigenvector along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane. A unit vector in the x-z plane can be parameterized by a single angle, $\\theta$, which we can define as the angle with the z-axis.\n    In Cartesian coordinates, this vector is $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$. The components are $n_x = \\sin\\theta$, $n_y = 0$, and $n_z = \\cos\\theta$.\n\n3.  **Construct the operator along the direction $\\vec{n}$:**\n    The operator for the spin component along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is given by the dot product $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$.\n    $P_n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n    $P_n = (\\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\sigma_x) \\sin\\theta + (\\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\sigma_y) (0) + (\\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\sigma_z) \\cos\\theta$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} (\\sigma_x \\sin\\theta + \\sigma_z \\cos\\theta)$\n    Substituting the matrices:\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\right)$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n4.  **Set up the eigenvalue equation:**\n    We need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$. The eigenvalue equation is $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$.\n    $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n5.  **Solve the eigenvalue equation:**\n    We can cancel the constant $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ from both sides:\n    $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n    This gives a system of two linear equations:\n    1) $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n    2) $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n\n    Let's work with the first equation to find the relationship between $a$ and $b$:\n    $b \\sin\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n\n    Now, we use the trigonometric half-angle identities:\n    $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$\n    $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$\n\n    Substituting these into the expression for $b/a$:\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n    So, $b = a \\tan(\\theta/2)$.\n\n    The unnormalized eigenvector is $|\\psi\\rangle_{un} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ a\\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$. We can choose $a=1$ for simplicity, giving $|\\psi\\rangle_{un} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$. A more convenient choice is to set $a = \\cos(\\theta/2)$. Then $b = \\cos(\\theta/2) \\tan(\\theta/2) = \\sin(\\theta/2)$.\n    This gives the unnormalized eigenvector as $|\\psi\\rangle_{un} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n6.  **Normalize the eigenvector:**\n    The normalization condition requires that the sum of the squared magnitudes of the components equals 1. For our proposed eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$:\n    Norm squared $= |\\cos(\\theta/2)|^2 + |\\sin(\\theta/2)|^2 = \\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 1$.\n    The vector is already normalized.\n\n7.  **Final Answer:**\n    The elements of the normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$. This matches option C.\n\nLet's quickly check the given options:\nA) (\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar) - Incorrect. Eigenvector components are dimensionless probability amplitudes. The factor $\\hbar$ makes it dimensionally incorrect.\nB) (\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta)) - Incorrect. This describes the direction vector $\\vec{n}$, not the spin state. Also, it uses full angles, whereas spin-1/2 systems are described by half-angles. For the x-z plane, $\\phi=0$, giving $(\\cos\\theta, \\sin\\theta)$.\nC) (\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2)) - Correct. This matches our derivation. It is dimensionless, normalized, and uses the correct half-angles.\nD) (\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2)) - Incorrect. Dimensionally incorrect due to $\\hbar$ and has arbitrary prefactors.\n\n<<<C>>>"
