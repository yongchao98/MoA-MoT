    "This question asks us to compare the densities of four different exoplanets. To solve this, we need to understand the relationship between a planet's mass, composition, and density.\n\n### Reasoning and Analysis\n\n1.  **Define Density:** Density (ρ) is defined as mass (M) divided by volume (V). For a spherical planet, the volume is V = (4/3)πR³, where R is the radius. So, ρ = M / [(4/3)πR³].\n\n2.  **Gravitational Compression:** For planets with the same composition (i.e., made of the same materials in the same proportions), a more massive planet will exert stronger gravitational force on its own material. This increased gravity compresses the material more, forcing the atoms closer together and thus increasing the overall density. Conversely, a less massive planet will have weaker self-gravity, resulting in less compression and lower density.\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on this principle:\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is our reference point. Earth's average density is approximately 5.51 g/cm³. Let's call this ρ_Earth. So, ρ_a ≈ 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is explicitly given as ρ_b ≈ 5.5 g/cm³. This is very close to Earth's density. Note: A rocky planet of 2 Earth masses would normally be denser than Earth due to compression. This planet must have a lighter composition (e.g., more water/ice, fewer heavy metals) than Earth to have such a low density for its mass.\n\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** This planet is made of the same \"stuff\" as Earth but is much more massive (M_c = 5 * M_Earth). Due to its significantly higher mass, its internal gravity will be much stronger, leading to greater gravitational compression. This compression will make the planet denser than Earth. So, we expect ρ_c > ρ_Earth.\n\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** This planet is also made of the same \"stuff\" as Earth but is less massive (M_d = 0.5 * M_Earth). With less mass, its self-gravity is weaker, leading to less compression compared to Earth. Therefore, its density will be lower than Earth's. We expect ρ_d < ρ_Earth.\n\n### Quantitative Comparison\n\nWe can use a known approximation for the relationship between mass and radius for rocky planets, which is roughly R ∝ M^0.27. Density is ρ ∝ M/R³, so ρ ∝ M/(M^0.27)³ = M/(M^0.81) = M^0.19. This confirms our qualitative reasoning: density increases with mass for planets of the same composition.\n\nLet's estimate the densities:\n*   ρ_a ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n*   ρ_b ≈ 5.50 g/cm³\n*   ρ_c ≈ ρ_Earth * (5)^0.19 ≈ 5.51 * 1.34 ≈ 7.38 g/cm³\n*   ρ_d ≈ ρ_Earth * (0.5)^0.19 ≈ 5.51 * 0.875 ≈ 4.82 g/cm³\n\n### Conclusion\n\nComparing the densities:\n*   ρ_a ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n*   ρ_b ≈ 5.50 g/cm³\n*   ρ_c ≈ 7.38 g/cm³\n*   ρ_d ≈ 4.82 g/cm³\n\nThe planet with the highest density is clearly option (c).\n\n<<<A>>>"
