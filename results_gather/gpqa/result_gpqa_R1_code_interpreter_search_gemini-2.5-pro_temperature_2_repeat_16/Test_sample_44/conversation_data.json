    "This problem requires us to determine the energies of the ground state and the first two excited states for a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n**1. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nFor a particle of mass 'm' in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L, the quantized energy levels are given by:\n$E_n = n^2 \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\nwhere n = 1, 2, 3, ... is the principal quantum number.\n\nThe problem defines a base unit of energy $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\nSo, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as:\n$E_n = n^2 E$\n*   $E_1 = 1^2 E = E$\n*   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n*   and so on.\n\n**2. Pauli Exclusion Principle**\n\nThe particles are spin-1/2, which means they are fermions. According to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. A quantum state here is defined by the principal quantum number (n) and the spin projection quantum number ($m_s$, which can be +1/2 for spin-up or -1/2 for spin-down). This implies that each energy level 'n' can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n**3. Ground State Energy ($E_{gs}$)**\n\nTo find the ground state, we must fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles, following the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   **n=1 level:** We can place two particles in this level (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n    *   Energy contributed by these two particles = 2 * $E_1$ = 2 * E = 2E.\n*   **n=2 level:** We have two remaining particles. We can place them in the next lowest level, n=2 (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n    *   Energy contributed by these two particles = 2 * $E_2$ = 2 * (4E) = 8E.\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n$E_{gs}$ = (Energy from n=1) + (Energy from n=2) = 2E + 8E = 10E.\n\n**4. First Excited State Energy ($E_{1st}$)**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. This is achieved by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n\n*   **Ground State Configuration:** Two particles in n=1, two particles in n=2.\n*   **Lowest Energy Excitation:** Move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level (the lowest available empty level).\n*   **New Configuration:** Two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\n$E_{1st}$ = (2 * $E_1$) + (1 * $E_2$) + (1 * $E_3$)\n$E_{1st}$ = (2 * E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.\n\n**5. Second Excited State Energy ($E_{2nd}$)**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We need to consider all possible excitations from the ground state and find the one with the second-lowest energy.\n\nWe already found the first excited state (energy 15E) by promoting a particle from n=2 to n=3. Let's consider other possibilities:\n\n*   **Possibility A: Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3.**\n    *   This is the next lowest single-particle excitation. The ground state has particles in n=1 and n=2. Promoting from n=2 to n=3 gives the 1st excited state. Promoting from n=1 to n=3 must result in a different, higher energy state.\n    *   **New Configuration:** One particle in n=1, two particles in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n    *   **Energy:** $E_A$ = (1 * $E_1$) + (2 * $E_2$) + (1 * $E_3$) = (1 * E) + (2 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n\n*   **Possibility B: Promote two particles from n=2 to n=3.**\n    *   **New Configuration:** Two particles in n=1, two particles in n=3.\n    *   **Energy:** $E_B$ = (2 * $E_1$) + (2 * $E_3$) = (2 * E) + (2 * 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n\n*   **Possibility C: Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4.**\n    *   **New Configuration:** Two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, one particle in n=4.\n    *   **Energy:** $E_C$ = (2 * $E_1$) + (1 * $E_2$) + (1 * $E_4$) = (2 * E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n\nComparing the energies of these excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E...), the second lowest energy after the ground state (10E) is 18E.\n\n*   Ground State: 10E\n*   First Excited State: 15E\n*   Second Excited State: 18E\n\nThe energies are 10E, 15E, and 18E. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
