    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the electric field at point P.\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial state:** We begin with a spherical conductor that is electrically neutral (uncharged). It has a cavity inside.\n\n2.  **Placing the charge:** A positive point charge `+q` is placed inside the cavity.\n\n3.  **Induction on the inner surface:** The presence of the positive charge `+q` inside the cavity will attract negative charges from the conductor. These negative charges will accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity. According to Gauss's Law, to make the electric field inside the conducting material zero, the total charge induced on the inner surface must be equal and opposite to the charge enclosed.\n    *   Let's consider a Gaussian surface that lies entirely within the conducting material and encloses the cavity.\n    *   The electric field $\\vec{E}$ must be zero everywhere on this Gaussian surface because it is inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium.\n    *   Gauss's Law states: $\\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = \\frac{Q_{enclosed}}{\\epsilon_o}$.\n    *   Since $\\vec{E} = 0$, the integral is zero, which implies that the total charge enclosed, $Q_{enclosed}$, must be zero.\n    *   The enclosed charge is the sum of the point charge `+q` and the charge induced on the inner cavity surface, $q_{inner}$.\n    *   $Q_{enclosed} = +q + q_{inner} = 0$.\n    *   Therefore, the charge induced on the inner surface is $q_{inner} = -q$.\n\n4.  **Induction on the outer surface:** The conductor was initially neutral. Since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a corresponding positive charge must appear elsewhere to maintain the overall charge neutrality of the conductor. This excess positive charge will move to the outermost surface of the conductor to maximize its separation.\n    *   Total charge of the conductor = $q_{inner} + q_{outer} = 0$ (since it was initially uncharged).\n    *   $-q + q_{outer} = 0$.\n    *   Therefore, the charge induced on the outer surface is $q_{outer} = +q$.\n\n5.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A fundamental property of a closed conducting shell (like our spherical conductor) is that it shields its exterior from the electric field of any charges placed inside it. The electric field at any point outside the conductor is determined *only* by the charge distribution on the *outer surface* of the conductor. The original charge `+q` inside the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the inner surface combine to produce zero electric field everywhere outside the cavity, which includes point P.\n\n6.  **Charge distribution on the outer surface:** We have a total charge of `+q` on the outer surface of the spherical conductor. Since there are no other external charges or fields, this charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over the spherical outer surface. This happens because the shielding effect prevents the internal charges from influencing the outer charge distribution.\n\n7.  **Calculating the Electric Field at Point P:** Now, the problem is simplified to finding the electric field from a uniformly charged spherical shell with total charge `+q` and radius `R`. According to the Shell Theorem (a direct result of Gauss's Law), the electric field at a point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as if all the charge were concentrated at a point charge at the center of the sphere.\n    *   Total charge on the outer shell = `+q`.\n    *   Center of the shell = O.\n    *   Point of interest = P.\n    *   Distance from the center O to the point P = `L`.\n\n8.  **Final Calculation:** The magnitude of the electric field at P is given by Coulomb's Law for a point charge:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{Total Charge}}{(\\text{Distance from center})^2}$\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nNotice that the details about the cavity's location (`s`), its radius (`r`), the distance from the cavity's center (`l`), and the angle (`\\theta`) are all irrelevant to the electric field *outside* the conductor due to the principle of electrostatic shielding. This information would be necessary to find the field *inside* the cavity, but not outside the conductor.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\n\nOur derived expression matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
