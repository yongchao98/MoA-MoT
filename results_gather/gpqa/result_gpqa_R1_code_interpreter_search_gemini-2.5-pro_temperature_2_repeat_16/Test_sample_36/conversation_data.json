    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product E, followed by an analysis of its 13C-NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF3 → A**\n*   **Propionaldehyde** (also known as propanal) has the structure CH₃CH₂CHO.\n*   **EDT** is ethane-1,2-dithiol, which has the structure HS-CH₂-CH₂-SH.\n*   This reaction is the formation of a cyclic thioacetal to protect the aldehyde carbonyl group. The Lewis acid BF₃ catalyzes the reaction. The oxygen of the carbonyl group is replaced by the two sulfur atoms of EDT, forming a five-membered ring (a 1,3-dithiolane).\n*   The groups attached to the original carbonyl carbon (an ethyl group, -CH₂CH₃, and a hydrogen atom, -H) remain attached to this carbon.\n*   The structure of product **A** is 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n    ```\n          H\n         /\n    CH₃-CH₂-C-----S-CH₂\n             \\   /\n              S-CH₂\n    ```\n\n**Step 2: A + BuLi → B**\n*   **BuLi** (butyllithium) is a very strong base.\n*   It deprotonates the most acidic proton in molecule A. The proton on the carbon between the two electron-withdrawing sulfur atoms (the C2 position of the dithiolane ring) is significantly acidic (pKa ≈ 31) and will be removed by BuLi.\n*   Product **B** is the resulting carbanion (a lithiated dithiolane).\n    ```\n          (-) Li(+)\n         /\n    CH₃-CH₂-C-----S-CH₂\n             \\   /\n              S-CH₂\n    ```\n\n**Step 3: B + Bromoethane → C**\n*   Product **B** is a strong nucleophile.\n*   **Bromoethane** (CH₃CH₂-Br) is an electrophile.\n*   This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction where the carbanion B attacks the ethyl group of bromoethane, displacing the bromide ion. An ethyl group is added to the C2 position.\n*   Product **C** is 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane. The original ethyl group and the newly added ethyl group are both attached to C2.\n    ```\n        CH₂CH₃\n       /\n    CH₃-CH₂-C-----S-CH₂\n             \\   /\n              S-CH₂\n    ```\n\n**Step 4: C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**\n*   This is a deprotection step. The thioacetal group is hydrolyzed back to a carbonyl group using mercuric chloride (HgCl₂) in aqueous acid.\n*   The C(SR)₂ moiety is converted back to a C=O group. The two ethyl groups on the C2 carbon remain.\n*   Product **D** is a ketone with two ethyl groups attached to the carbonyl carbon. This is diethyl ketone, also known as **pentan-3-one**.\n    ```\n      O\n     //\n    CH₃-CH₂-C-CH₂-CH₃\n    ```\n\n**Step 5: D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**\n*   This is a **Wittig reaction**, which converts a ketone into an alkene.\n*   First, the Wittig reagent (an ylide) is prepared from triphenylphosphine (PPh₃), 3-bromopentane, and BuLi.\n    *   **Alkyl halide**: 3-bromopentane is (CH₃CH₂)₂CH-Br.\n    *   **Ylide formation**: PPh₃ reacts with the alkyl halide, and the resulting phosphonium salt is deprotonated by BuLi to form the ylide, (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃.\n*   Then, the ylide reacts with the ketone **D** (pentan-3-one, (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O).\n*   The overall reaction is: (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O + (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃ → (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₃CH₂)₂ + Ph₃P=O\n*   Product **E** is the resulting highly substituted and symmetrical alkene, **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**.\n    ```\n      CH₃-CH₂     CH₂-CH₃\n             \\   /\n              C=C\n             /   \\\n      CH₃-CH₂     CH₂-CH₃\n    ```\n\n**Analysis of the 13C-NMR Signals of Product E**\n\nTo determine the number of signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the molecule E, 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene.\n*   The molecule can be represented as (Et)₂C=C(Et)₂, where Et is an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n*   The molecule possesses a high degree of symmetry. There is a C₂ axis of symmetry passing through the midpoint of the C=C bond, perpendicular to the bond. This symmetry makes the left and right halves of the molecule identical.\n*   Additionally, due to free rotation around the single bonds, the four ethyl groups become chemically equivalent on the NMR timescale.\n*   Therefore, we only need to consider the distinct carbon atoms within one of the four identical ethyl groups and the carbons of the double bond.\n\nLet's identify the chemically non-equivalent carbons:\n1.  **The methyl carbons (-CH₃)**: All four methyl groups are in equivalent chemical environments due to the molecule's symmetry. They will produce a single signal.\n2.  **The methylene carbons (-CH₂-)**: All four methylene groups are also in equivalent chemical environments. They will produce a second, distinct signal.\n3.  **The sp²-hybridized carbons of the double bond (>C=)**: The two carbons of the C=C double bond are equivalent to each other by symmetry. They will produce a third, distinct signal.\n\nSo, despite having a total of 10 carbon atoms, the high symmetry of product E results in only **3** unique carbon environments. Therefore, the ¹³C-NMR spectrum will show 3 signals.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
