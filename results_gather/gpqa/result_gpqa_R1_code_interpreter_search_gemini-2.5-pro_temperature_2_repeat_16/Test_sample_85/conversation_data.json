    "This problem requires understanding the selective reactivity of two different reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3, towards a starting material that contains both a carboxylic acid group and an ester group. It also involves tracking the stereochemistry through the reaction sequences.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the structure of the starting materials and products.**\n\n*   **Product:** The product in both reactions is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a delta-lactone, which is a six-membered cyclic ester. It is formed from the cyclization of a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid. The parent acid is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid (HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH). The chiral center in the product is at carbon C4 (the one with the ethyl group). This corresponds to C3 of the parent open-chain acid.\n*   **Starting Material:** The options describe the starting material as \"(R/S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". This name indicates a derivative of pentanedioic acid (glutaric acid) where one carboxylic acid group is free and the other is esterified with isobutanol. The structure is `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-isobutyl`. This molecule has two carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid and an ester. It has one chiral center at the carbon bearing the ethyl group (C3).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) is a selective reducing agent. It reduces esters to primary alcohols but does not typically reduce carboxylic acids under mild conditions.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH₄ selectively reduces the isobutyl ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The carboxylic acid group at C1 remains unchanged.\n        `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu` --(LiBH₄)--> `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH`\n    2.  The resulting molecule is (3-ethyl)-5-hydroxypentanoic acid. The chiral center at C3 is not affected by this reaction, so its stereoconfiguration is retained.\n    3.  Under acidic workup (H⁺), the intermediate undergoes intramolecular esterification (lactonization). The hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the carboxylic acid at C1 to form the six-membered lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The stereochemistry of the chiral center is preserved throughout the reaction. Therefore, to obtain the (R)-lactone product, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** BH₃ (Borane) is also a selective reducing agent. It is particularly effective at reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols, while it reacts very slowly with esters.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The isobutyl ester group at C5 remains unchanged.\n        `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu` --(BH₃)--> `HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu`\n    2.  The resulting molecule is isobutyl (3-ethyl)-5-hydroxypentanoate. The chiral center at C3 is not affected by this reaction, so its stereoconfiguration is retained.\n    3.  Under acidic workup (H⁺), the intermediate undergoes intramolecular transesterification. The hydroxyl group (from the original acid) attacks the ester carbonyl, eliminating isobutanol and forming the same six-membered lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The stereochemistry of the chiral center is preserved throughout this reaction as well. To obtain the (S)-lactone product, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**Step 4: Final conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Starting material A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
