The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane barrel with eight alpha helices, four extracellular helices, and three beta sheets that create a binding site for the ligand. The ligand is a coiled-coil of two alpha helices. You create a bicistronic lox-Cre vector with the ligand ORF at the 5' position, fused to mCherry; the receptor ORF is at the 3' and fused to the eGFP at the C-terminus.

    "*   **Analysis of the construct:** The user describes a bicistronic vector. The expression is driven by a CBA promoter, which is a strong ubiquitous promoter. The first cistron is `Ligand-loxP-stop-loxP-mCherry` and the second is `IRES-Receptor-lox2272-stop-lox2272-eGFP`. The IRES element allows translation of the second cistron (receptor) from the same mRNA transcript as the first (ligand).\n\n*   **Analysis of the experiment:**\n    1.  **In vitro test:** The plasmid is transfected into astrocytes. Antibodies against the ligand and receptor show a signal. This step does not involve Cre recombinase. Therefore, the stop codons are still present. This test confirms that the CBA promoter can drive the expression of the ligand ORF (before the first stop) and the IRES element is functional, allowing the expression of the receptor ORF (before the second stop). It does not test the expression of the mCherry or eGFP fusion proteins.\n    2.  **In vivo mouse model:** A mouse homozygous for this construct (`Reporter/Reporter`) is crossed with a `SOX10-Cre` mouse. SOX10 is expressed in the neural crest lineage. In the offspring that inherit both the construct and the Cre transgene, Cre recombinase will be expressed in SOX10-positive cells.\n    3.  **Cre-recombinase action:** Cre recombinase recognizes both loxP and lox2272 sites. It will excise the DNA between two identical sites.\n        *   In the first cistron, Cre will remove the `stop` cassette flanked by loxP sites. This should lead to the expression of a Ligand-mCherry fusion protein.\n        *   In the second cistron, Cre will remove the `stop` cassette flanked by lox2272 sites. This should lead to the expression of a Receptor-eGFP fusion protein.\n    4.  **The Observation:** No green signal (eGFP) is observed. The question asks for the most likely reason.\n\n*   **Evaluation of the options:**\n    *   **A) the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing:** The CBA promoter is a strong, constitutive promoter that generally does not require a tissue-specific enhancer. The fact that the proteins were expressed in transfected astrocytes (Western Blot data) indicates the promoter is functional. This makes option A unlikely.\n    *   **B) the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi:** The receptor is a transmembrane protein and must traffic through the ER/Golgi to the cell surface. If the eGFP fusion caused misfolding, it could be retained in the ER or Golgi. However, this would typically result in an intracellular green signal (e.g., perinuclear fluorescence), not a complete absence of any signal. The problem states \"You do not observe a green signal\", implying no protein is being made or the tag is non-functional.\n    *   **C) ligand and the receptor are in a paracrine relationship:** This describes a biological mode of action (cell-to-cell signaling) and is what the experiment might be designed to investigate. It does not explain a technical failure in the expression of the eGFP reporter gene itself. The expression system is designed to label the cells that *produce* the receptor, regardless of where the ligand comes from. Thus, this is irrelevant to the observed problem.\n    *   **D) the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame:** This is a very strong candidate. After Cre-mediated recombination, the `stop` cassette is removed, but a single lox2272 site remains between the receptor ORF and the eGFP ORF. A lox site (both loxP and lox2272) is 34 base pairs long. Since 34 is not a multiple of 3 (34 = 3 x 11 + 1), the insertion of this 34 bp sequence will shift the reading frame. The ribosome will translate the receptor protein correctly, but after crossing the lox2272 site, it will read the eGFP sequence in the wrong frame. This frameshift will almost certainly lead to a premature stop codon and the production of a truncated, non-fluorescent protein instead of the intended Receptor-eGFP fusion. This perfectly explains the complete absence of a green signal.\n\n**Conclusion:** The recombination event leaves a lox2272 site behind. The length of this site (34 bp) is not divisible by 3, causing a frameshift that prevents the proper translation of the downstream eGFP tag.\n\n<<<D>>>"
