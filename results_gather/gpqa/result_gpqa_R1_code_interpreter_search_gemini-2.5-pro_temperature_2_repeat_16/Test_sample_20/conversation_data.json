    "**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Part A: Tautomerism**\n    The question asks to identify the compound between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione that *does not* show tautomerism. Tautomerism, specifically keto-enol tautomerism, involves the interconversion of a keto form (containing a C=O group) and an enol form (containing a C=C-OH group). This process typically requires a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the alpha-carbon), and this carbon must be sp3 hybridized.\n\n    *   **Benzoquinone (specifically p-benzoquinone):**\n        *   Its structure is a six-membered ring with alternating double bonds and two carbonyl groups at opposite positions (1 and 4).\n        *   The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (alpha-carbons) are at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6.\n        *   These alpha-carbons are part of a C=C double bond, meaning they are sp2 hybridized.\n        *   Because there are no alpha-hydrogens on an sp3 hybridized carbon, standard keto-enol tautomerism is not possible. To form an enol (a phenol-type structure), a chemical reaction (reduction) would be required, which is different from tautomerism (an equilibrium between isomers).\n        *   Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n        *   Its structure is a six-membered saturated ring (all single bonds between carbons) with three carbonyl groups (C=O) at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n        *   The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are the alpha-carbons.\n        *   Each of these alpha-carbons is a CH2 group, so they are sp3 hybridized and each has two alpha-hydrogens.\n        *   The presence of these alpha-hydrogens allows for keto-enol tautomerism. The molecule can lose protons from these alpha-carbons to form enols.\n        *   In fact, this compound exists almost exclusively in its highly stable aromatic enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene).\n        *   Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n    The question asks to identify which compound between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate will show optical isomerism. Optical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. A common feature of chiral molecules is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n    *   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n        *   The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n        *   Let's analyze the carbon at position 2 (the one with the -OH group). It is bonded to:\n            1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n            2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n            3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n            4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n        *   Since this carbon is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center.\n        *   The presence of this chiral center makes the molecule chiral and thus capable of showing optical isomerism (it exists as two enantiomers).\n        *   Therefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism**.\n\n    *   **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n        *   This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, where the two ester groups are *trans* to each other across the C=C double bond.\n        *   Let's check for chirality.\n        *   The molecule has no chiral centers (no carbon is attached to four different groups).\n        *   The molecule has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C bond. A molecule with a center of inversion is achiral. It also has a plane of symmetry if we consider the molecule to be planar.\n        *   Since the molecule is achiral, it is not optically active.\n        *   Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism**.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n3.  **Final Combination:**\n    *   Compound A (no tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n    *   This combination matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
