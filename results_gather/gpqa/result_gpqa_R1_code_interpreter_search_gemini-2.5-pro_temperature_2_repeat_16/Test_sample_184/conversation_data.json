    "An elegant way to solve this problem is to compute the square of the Hamiltonian operator, H.\nLet's analyze the properties of the operator $\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n}$.\n\n$H = \\varepsilon (\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n}) = \\varepsilon(n_x\\sigma_x + n_y\\sigma_y + n_z\\sigma_z)$\n\nNow let's compute $H^2$:\n$H^2 = \\varepsilon^2 (n_x\\sigma_x + n_y\\sigma_y + n_z\\sigma_z)^2$\n\nTo expand the squared term, we use the identity $(\\vec{A}\\cdot\\vec{B})(\\vec{C}\\cdot\\vec{D})=(\\vec{A}\\cdot\\vec{C})(\\vec{B}\\cdot\\vec{D})+i(\\vec{A}\\times\\vec{C})\\cdot(\\vec{B}\\times\\vec{D})$ which for matrices is often expressed using the identity $(\\vec{\\sigma}\\cdot\\vec{a})(\\vec{\\sigma}\\cdot\\vec{b}) = (\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b})I + i\\vec{\\sigma}\\cdot(\\vec{a}\\times\\vec{b})$ where $I$ is the $2\\times 2$ identity matrix.\n\nIn our case, $\\vec{a} = \\vec{n}$ and $\\vec{b} = \\vec{n}$.\nSo, we have:\n$(\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n})^2 = (\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n})(\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n}) = (\\vec{n}\\cdot\\vec{n})I + i\\vec{\\sigma}\\cdot(\\vec{n}\\times\\vec{n})$\n\nSince $\\vec{n}$ is a unit vector, its magnitude is 1, so the dot product $\\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{n} = |\\vec{n}|^2 = 1^2 = 1$.\nThe cross product of any vector with itself is the zero vector, so $\\vec{n} \\times \\vec{n} = \\vec{0}$.\n\nSubstituting these results back into the equation:\n$(\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n})^2 = (1)I + i\\vec{\\sigma}\\cdot(\\vec{0}) = I$\n\nNow, substitute this back into the expression for $H^2$:\n$H^2 = \\varepsilon^2 I$\n\nLet $\\lambda$ be an eigenvalue of the operator $H$ with a corresponding eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle$. By definition:\n$H |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$\n\nApplying the operator $H$ one more time to this equation:\n$H^2 |\\psi\\rangle = H (\\lambda |\\psi\\rangle) = \\lambda (H |\\psi\\rangle) = \\lambda (\\lambda |\\psi\\rangle) = \\lambda^2 |\\psi\\rangle$\n\nWe also know that $H^2 = \\varepsilon^2 I$, so we can write:\n$H^2 |\\psi\\rangle = (\\varepsilon^2 I) |\\psi\\rangle = \\varepsilon^2 |\\psi\\rangle$\n\nBy comparing the two expressions for $H^2 |\\psi\\rangle$, we get:\n$\\lambda^2 |\\psi\\rangle = \\varepsilon^2 |\\psi\\rangle$\n\nSince $|\\psi\\rangle$ is a non-zero eigenvector, we can conclude that:\n$\\lambda^2 = \\varepsilon^2$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides gives the possible values for the eigenvalues $\\lambda$:\n$\\lambda = \\pm \\varepsilon$\n\nTherefore, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator are $+\\varepsilon$ and $-\\varepsilon$.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
