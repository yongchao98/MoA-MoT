    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to identify the unknown compound from the given 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nWe are given the following signals:\n*   **Signal 1: 2.1 ppm (3H, s)**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents 3 protons, which is typical for a methyl group (CH₃).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This chemical shift is characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl carbon (C=O). In the given options, all are acetates, which contain the acetyl group (CH₃-C(=O)-). This signal is the acetyl methyl group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (s):** A singlet means this methyl group has no adjacent protons. This is consistent with an acetyl group, as the methyl is attached to a carbonyl carbon with no protons.\n\n*   **Signal 2: 1.6 ppm (3H, d)**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal also represents a methyl group (CH₃).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d):** A doublet means this methyl group is coupled to one adjacent proton (according to the n+1 rule, 2 peaks means n=1 proton). This suggests a `CH-CH₃` fragment.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This shift is in the allylic region, which is typical for a methyl group attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (`=C-CH₃`).\n\n*   **Signal 3: 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal represents a single proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** This shift is in the vinylic region, meaning this proton is attached directly to a carbon-carbon double bond (`C=CH`).\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq):** A doublet of quartets means this proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   The **quartet (q)** arises from coupling to a group of 3 equivalent protons (n+1 = 4, so n=3). This corresponds to the methyl group at 1.6 ppm.\n        *   The **doublet (d)** arises from coupling to one other proton (n+1 = 2, so n=1). This must be another vinylic proton on the double bond.\n    *   This confirms the existence of a `CH=CH-CH₃` fragment, and this signal corresponds to the `CH` that is in between the other vinylic proton and the methyl group.\n\n*   **Signal 4: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal represents a single proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This is a highly deshielded vinylic proton. Such a large chemical shift for a vinylic proton indicates it is attached to a very electronegative atom, in this case, the oxygen of the acetate ester (`-O-CH=C`).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d):** A doublet means this proton is coupled to one adjacent proton, which is the other vinylic proton at 5.5 ppm.\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This is the key piece of information for determining the stereochemistry (cis vs. trans).\n        *   A coupling constant (J) for **trans** protons on a double bond is typically large, in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n        *   A coupling constant for **cis** protons is smaller, in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n    *   The observed value of 16.0 Hz strongly indicates that the two vinylic protons are in a **trans** configuration.\n\n**2. Assemble the Structure**\n\nBased on the analysis, we can assemble the fragments:\n*   We have an acetate group: `CH₃-C(=O)-O-` (from the 2.1 ppm singlet).\n*   We have a `CH=CH-CH₃` fragment (from the other three signals).\n*   The connection is through the ester oxygen to the double bond: `CH₃-C(=O)-O-CH=CH-CH₃`.\n*   The total number of carbons in the alkenyl group (the part derived from the alcohol) is 3 (`-CH=CH-CH₃`), so it is a **propenyl** group, not a butenyl group.\n*   The stereochemistry of the double bond is **trans** (from J = 16.0 Hz).\n\nPutting it all together, the structure is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options**\n\n*   A) Trans-butenyl acetate: Incorrect. A butenyl group would have 4 carbons, which doesn't match the NMR data (we'd expect different signals, likely a `CH₂CH₃` group instead of a `CH₃` on the double bond).\n*   B) **Trans-propenyl acetate:** Correct. Matches all aspects of the NMR data: the number of signals, integration, chemical shifts, splitting patterns, and the crucial trans coupling constant.\n*   C) Cis-butenyl acetate: Incorrect. Wrong carbon count and wrong stereochemistry.\n*   D) Cis-propenyl acetate: Incorrect. A cis isomer would show a much smaller coupling constant (J ≈ 6-12 Hz).\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<B>>>"
