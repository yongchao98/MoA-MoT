    "This is a problem of special relativity. We need to calculate the distance traveled by the supernova ejecta as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame. To do this, we must first find the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame, which will be different from the time elapsed in the ejecta's frame due to time dilation.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the given information:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the ejecta and the Galaxy center, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time elapsed in the moving reference frame (the ejecta's frame), which is the proper time, `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n    *   The speed of light, `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n2.  **Determine the required quantity:**\n    *   The distance traveled by the ejecta as measured in the stationary reference frame (the Galaxy's frame), `d`.\n\n3.  **Apply the principles of special relativity:**\n    *   According to the principle of time dilation, a clock moving at a relativistic speed `v` relative to a stationary observer will be measured to tick slower. The time measured in the stationary frame (`Δt`) is related to the proper time (`Δt₀`) by the Lorentz factor `γ`.\n    *   The formula for the Lorentz factor is: `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   The formula for time dilation is: `Δt = γ * Δt₀`.\n    *   The distance traveled in the Galaxy frame is then calculated using the velocity and the time measured in the Galaxy frame: `d = v * Δt`.\n\n4.  **Perform the calculations:**\n    *   First, calculate the ratio `β = v/c`:\n        `β = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Next, calculate the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n    *   Now, calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame, `Δt`:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀ = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n    *   Finally, calculate the distance `d` traveled in the Galaxy's frame:\n        `d = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * [(1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s]`\n        `d = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\nTo get the final numerical value, we can use a Python script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv = 60000  # velocity in km/s\ndelta_t0 = 50  # proper time in seconds\nc = 300000  # speed of light in km/s\n\n# Calculate beta (v/c)\nbeta = v / c\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta**2)\n\n# Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (delta_t)\ndelta_t = gamma * delta_t0\n\n# Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame\ndistance = v * delta_t\n\nprint(f\"{distance:.0f}\")\n```\n>>>\n3061862\n\nThe calculated distance is 3,061,862 km. This value is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reference Frames:**\n    *   Let the Galaxy be the \"stationary\" reference frame, S.\n    *   Let the supernova ejecta be the \"moving\" reference frame, S'.\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time elapsed in the moving frame S' (the ejecta's frame) is `Δt₀ = 50 s`. This is the *proper time* because the measurement of time is made in the same frame where the \"clock\" (in this case, the process of the ejecta moving) is at rest.\n    *   The speed of light is `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame S. Let's call this distance `d`. The formula for distance is `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed as measured in the Galaxy's frame S.\n\n4.  **Apply the Principle of Time Dilation:**\n    *   According to Einstein's theory of special relativity, time passes differently for observers in different inertial frames of reference. An observer in the stationary frame S will measure time passing more slowly in the moving frame S'. This effect is called time dilation.\n    *   The relationship between the time interval in the stationary frame (`Δt`) and the proper time in the moving frame (`Δt₀`) is given by the formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    *   Here, `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the relative velocity `v`. The formula for the Lorentz factor is:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) `\n\n5.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    *   First, let's find the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light, often denoted as `β` (beta):\n        `β = v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Now, plug this into the Lorentz factor formula:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n    *   Calculating `sqrt(0.96)` gives approximately `0.9798`.\n    *   `γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Time in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt):**\n    *   Using the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀ ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`\n    *   This means that while 50 seconds have passed for the ejecta, an observer in the Galaxy's frame would measure about 51.03 seconds passing.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame (d):**\n    *   Now we can calculate the distance traveled by the ejecta as measured by the observer in the Galaxy's frame:\n        `d = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   A) 2,940,000 km\n    *   B) 3,000,000 km (This would be the result if relativistic effects were ignored: 60,000 km/s * 50 s)\n    *   C) 2,880,000 km\n    *   D) 3,060,000 km\n\n    The calculated value `3,061,862 km` is closest to option D. The previous execution of the code confirms this calculation precisely.\n\n<<<D>>>"
