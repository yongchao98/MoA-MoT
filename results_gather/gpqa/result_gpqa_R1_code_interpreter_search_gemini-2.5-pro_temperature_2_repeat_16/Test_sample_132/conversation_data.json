    "This problem requires a step-by-step calculation of the concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-) in a buffer solution. The solution contains potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na2HPO4●2H2O).\n\n**1. Identify the species in the solution:**\n*   KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4- (dihydrogen phosphate).\n*   Na2HPO4●2H2O dissociates into 2Na+, HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and 2H2O.\n*   This creates a buffer system consisting of the weak acid H2PO4- and its conjugate base HPO4^2-.\n\n**2. The relevant equilibria for phosphoric acid (H3PO4) are:**\n*   H3PO4 ⇌ H+ + H2PO4- ; Ka1 = 7.5x10^-3\n*   H2PO4- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2- ; Ka2 = 6.2x10^-8\n*   HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3- ; Ka3 = 1.8x10^-12\n\nThe buffer system H2PO4- / HPO4^2- is governed by Ka2. The concentration of the final species, PO4^3- (orthophosphate), is determined by the Ka3 equilibrium.\n\n**3. Calculate the initial molar concentrations of H2PO4- and HPO4^2-:**\n*   Volume of the solution (V) = 200.00 cm3 = 0.200 L.\n*   Moles of KH2PO4 = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol\n*   Moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol\n*   Initial concentration [H2PO4-] = Moles of KH2PO4 / V\n*   Initial concentration [HPO4^2-] = Moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O / V\n\n**4. Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] in the buffer solution:**\nThe pH (and thus [H+]) of the buffer is primarily determined by the H2PO4-/HPO4^2- equilibrium (Ka2).\nFrom the Ka2 expression: Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\nWe can rearrange this to solve for [H+]:\n[H+] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-])\nSince Ka2 is small, we can assume the equilibrium concentrations of the buffer components are approximately equal to their initial concentrations.\n\n**5. Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-]:**\nThe concentration of PO4^3- is determined by the third dissociation step (Ka3).\nFrom the Ka3 expression: Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\nWe can rearrange this to solve for [PO4^3-]:\n[PO4^3-] = Ka3 * ([HPO4^2-] / [H+])\nWe will use the [H+] calculated in the previous step and the initial concentration of [HPO4^2-], as its further dissociation into PO4^3- is negligible due to the very small Ka3 value.\n\nNow, we perform the calculations using Python.\n\n```python\n# Define constants based on the problem statement\nV = 0.200  # Volume in Liters\nmass_KH2PO4 = 1.00  # grams\nMw_KH2PO4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00  # grams\nMw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99  # g/mol\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 1: Calculate moles of each component\nmoles_H2PO4 = mass_KH2PO4 / Mw_KH2PO4\nmoles_HPO4_2 = mass_Na2HPO4_2H2O / Mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the initial concentrations\nconc_H2PO4 = moles_H2PO4 / V\nconc_HPO4_2 = moles_HPO4_2 / V\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] from the buffer equilibrium (Ka2)\n# Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-] => [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-]\nH_plus_conc = Ka2 * (conc_H2PO4 / conc_HPO4_2)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-] from the third dissociation (Ka3)\n# Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-] => [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]\nconc_PO4_3 = Ka3 * (conc_HPO4_2 / H_plus_conc)\n\n# Print the final result in scientific notation\nprint(f\"{conc_PO4_3:.2e}\")\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical species and the relevant equilibrium.**\n    The solution is created by dissolving KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4●2H2O in water.\n    *   KH2PO4 is a salt that completely dissociates into K+ (a spectator ion) and H2PO4- (dihydrogen phosphate).\n    *   Na2HPO4●2H2O is a salt that completely dissociates into 2 Na+ (spectator ions), HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and water.\n    *   The primary components influencing the pH are the weak acid H2PO4- and its conjugate base HPO4^2-. This pair forms a buffer solution.\n\n2.  **Determine the relevant acid dissociation constants (Ka).**\n    The problem provides the three dissociation steps for phosphoric acid (H3PO4):\n    *   H3PO4 ⇌ H+ + H2PO4- (Ka1 = 7.5x10^-3)\n    *   H2PO4- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2x10^-8)\n    *   HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8x10^-12)\n    The buffer system in the solution is governed by Ka2. The species we want to find the concentration of, the orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-), is produced in the reaction governed by Ka3.\n\n3.  **Calculate the initial molar concentrations of the buffer components.**\n    *   Volume of solution (V) = 200.00 cm3 = 0.20000 L.\n    *   Moles of KH2PO4 = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol.\n    *   Concentration of H2PO4- = (1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol) / 0.20000 L.\n    *   Moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol.\n    *   Concentration of HPO4^2- = (1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol) / 0.20000 L.\n\n4.  **Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] using the buffer equation.**\n    Since the solution is a buffer, we can use the expression for Ka2 to find the [H+]. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation could be used to find the pH, but working directly with the Ka expression is more direct.\n    Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\n    We can assume that the equilibrium concentrations of the buffer components are approximately equal to their initial calculated concentrations because Ka2 is small.\n    [H+] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-])\n\n5.  **Calculate the concentration of the orthophosphate ion [PO4^3-].**\n    The concentration of PO4^3- is determined by the third dissociation equilibrium (Ka3).\n    Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n    We can rearrange this equation to solve for [PO4^3-]. We will use the [H+] calculated from the buffer in the previous step and the initial concentration of [HPO4^2-]. This is a valid approximation because Ka3 is extremely small, meaning very little HPO4^2- will dissociate, and the pH is effectively fixed by the much more concentrated buffer components.\n    [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * ([HPO4^2-] / [H+])\n\nNow, we can use a Python script to perform these calculations accurately.\n\n```python\n# Define constants from the problem statement\nV = 0.20000  # Volume in Liters\nmass_KH2PO4 = 1.00  # mass of KH2PO4 in grams\nMw_KH2PO4 = 136.09  # Molar mass of KH2PO4 in g/mol\nmass_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00  # mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O in grams\nMw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99  # Molar mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O in g/mol\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the moles of each phosphate species.\nmoles_H2PO4_minus = mass_KH2PO4 / Mw_KH2PO4\nmoles_HPO4_2minus = mass_Na2HPO4_2H2O / Mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the initial concentrations of the buffer components.\nconc_H2PO4_minus = moles_H2PO4_minus / V\nconc_HPO4_2minus = moles_HPO4_2minus / V\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] from the Ka2 equilibrium.\n# We assume the equilibrium concentrations of the buffer components are equal to their initial concentrations.\n# Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4-] => [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-]/[HPO4^2-]\nconc_H_plus = Ka2 * (conc_H2PO4_minus / conc_HPO4_2minus)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-] from the Ka3 equilibrium.\n# Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-] => [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]/[H+]\nconc_PO4_3minus = Ka3 * (conc_HPO4_2minus / conc_H_plus)\n\n# Print the final answer in scientific notation to compare with the options.\nprint(f\"{conc_PO4_3minus:.2e}\")\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
