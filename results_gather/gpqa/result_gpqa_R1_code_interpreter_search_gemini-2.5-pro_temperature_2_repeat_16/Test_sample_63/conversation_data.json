    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Experimental Setup and Data**\n\nThe problem describes the thermal decomposition of a mixture of two salts, A and B, and the subsequent analysis of the gaseous products. Let's break down the function of each step in the analysis:\n*   **Heating at 200°C without air:** The salts decompose into a mixture of gases. No external oxygen is involved.\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a powerful drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of this tube corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which absorbs acidic gases like CO₂, SO₂, or NO₂. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed.\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper acts as a reducing agent. It reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states CuO is formed, which means an oxygen-donating gas reacted with the copper. The mass increase of the tube is equal to the mass of oxygen atoms transferred from the gas to the copper.\n*   **Remaining gas C:** This is the gas that did not get absorbed or react in any of the three tubes.\n\n**2. Calculate the Moles of Each Product**\n\n*   **Water (H₂O):**\n    *   Mass increase of Tube №1 = 3.60 g.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Oxygen atoms transferred to Cu:**\n    *   Mass increase of Tube №3 = 0.80 g. This is the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (C):**\n    *   Volume of Gas C = 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**3. Determine the Composition of the Gaseous Products**\n\nThe gas mixture that entered Tube №3 contained an oxidizing gas and Gas C.\n*   The oxidizing gas donated 0.05 moles of oxygen atoms to the copper. Since no acidic gases were formed, the most likely candidates are O₂ or N₂O. Gas C (0.10 mol) is inert under these conditions, making it very likely to be N₂.\n*   Let's consider the identity of the oxidizing gas:\n    *   **Possibility 1: The gas is N₂O.** The reaction is Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂. To provide 0.05 mol of O atoms, 0.05 mol of N₂O must have reacted. This reaction would also produce 0.05 mol of N₂. The final gas C (0.10 mol N₂) would consist of this produced N₂ plus any N₂ that was in the original gas mixture. Thus, moles of N₂ from decomposition = 0.10 mol (total) - 0.05 mol (from N₂O) = 0.05 mol.\n        *   So, the gaseous products are: **0.20 mol H₂O, 0.05 mol N₂O, and 0.05 mol N₂.**\n    *   **Possibility 2: The gas is O₂.** The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. To provide 0.05 mol of O atoms, 0.025 mol of O₂ must have reacted (since each O₂ has 2 oxygen atoms). Gas C (0.10 mol) would be N₂ from the decomposition.\n        *   So, the gaseous products are: **0.20 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.10 mol N₂.**\n\n**4. Find the Elemental Composition of the Original Salt Mixture**\n\nWe calculate the total moles of each element (H, N, O) from the products. Let's check both possibilities.\n*   **From Possibility 1 (H₂O, N₂O, N₂):**\n    *   Moles of H = 0.20 mol H₂O × 2 H/H₂O = **0.40 mol H**\n    *   Moles of N = (0.05 mol N₂O × 2 N/N₂O) + (0.05 mol N₂ × 2 N/N₂) = 0.10 + 0.10 = **0.20 mol N**\n    *   Moles of O = (0.20 mol H₂O × 1 O/H₂O) + (0.05 mol N₂O × 1 O/N₂O) = 0.20 + 0.05 = **0.25 mol O**\n*   **From Possibility 2 (H₂O, O₂, N₂):**\n    *   Moles of H = 0.20 mol H₂O × 2 H/H₂O = **0.40 mol H**\n    *   Moles of N = 0.10 mol N₂ × 2 N/N₂ = **0.20 mol N**\n    *   Moles of O = (0.20 mol H₂O × 1 O/H₂O) + (0.025 mol O₂ × 2 O/O₂) = 0.20 + 0.05 = **0.25 mol O**\n\nBoth possibilities lead to the exact same elemental composition of the initial 7.20 g mixture: 0.40 mol H, 0.20 mol N, and 0.25 mol O.\n\n**5. Determine the Combined Formula of Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states that the initial mixture was **equimolar**, meaning it contained `n` moles of salt A and `n` moles of salt B.\nThe total moles of atoms found (0.40 H, 0.20 N, 0.25 O) are therefore contained in `n` formula units of A and `n` formula units of B.\nThe ratio of atoms in one combined (A+B) unit is the same as the mole ratio we found:\nH : N : O = 0.40 : 0.20 : 0.25\nTo get the simplest whole number ratio, we can multiply by 20:\nH : N : O = 8 : 4 : 5\n\nThis means that the combined chemical formula for one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B is **H₈N₄O₅**.\n\n**6. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This corresponds to the total number of atoms in the combined formula H₈N₄O₅.\nTotal atoms = (atoms of H) + (atoms of N) + (atoms of O)\nTotal atoms = 8 + 4 + 5 = 17.\n\n**Confirmation (Optional):**\nWe can identify the salts A and B. A formula of H₈N₄O₅ must be split into two salt formulas. Common salts with H, N, and O are ammonium salts. H₈N₄O₅ can be represented as (NH₄)₂(N₂O₅). The two anions must sum to N₂O₅²⁻. Plausible anions are NO₂⁻ and NO₃⁻.\n*   Salt A: Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) -> Formula N₂H₄O₂, Atoms = 2+4+2=8\n*   Salt B: Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃) -> Formula N₂H₄O₃, Atoms = 2+4+3=9\nThe sum of atoms is 8 + 9 = 17.\nThe decomposition reactions are NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O and NH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O. An equimolar mixture of these two salts would produce N₂, N₂O, and H₂O, which matches Possibility 1 and fully explains all the experimental results.\n\nFinal calculation:\n```python\n# Moles of H2O from mass increase of tube 1\nmoles_h2o = 3.60 / 18.0\n# Moles of O atoms from mass increase of tube 3\nmoles_o_atoms_cu = 0.80 / 16.0\n# Moles of gas C from volume at STP\nmoles_gas_c = 2.24 / 22.4\n\n# We deduce the decomposition products are 0.20 mol H2O, 0.05 mol N2O, and 0.05 mol N2.\n# Calculate total moles of each element in the original mixture.\ntotal_moles_H = moles_h2o * 2\ntotal_moles_N = 0.05 * 2 + 0.05 * 2 # From 0.05 mol N2O and 0.05 mol N2\ntotal_moles_O = moles_h2o * 1 + 0.05 * 1 # From 0.20 mol H2O and 0.05 mol N2O\n\n# The ratio of moles is the ratio of atoms in the combined (A+B) formula unit.\n# Ratio H:N:O = 0.4 : 0.2 : 0.25.

    "**1. Analyze the reactions in the analysis tubes:**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced by the decomposition.\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This tube absorbs acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed. This rules out the presence of carbon and sulfur in the original salts.\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent. It reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states CuO is formed, meaning the gas that reacted must have provided oxygen atoms. The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of these oxygen atoms.\n*   **Gas C:** The remaining gas is inert to all previous steps. It has a volume of 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n\n**2. Calculate the moles of each substance:**\n\n*   **Moles of H₂O:**\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Moles of Oxygen atoms reacted with Copper:**\n    *   Atomic mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n*   **Moles of Gas C:**\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**3. Identify the composition of the gaseous products:**\n\n*   Since no C or S is present, the salts must be composed of nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen. The inert gas C is therefore Nitrogen (N₂).\n*   The oxidizing gas that reacted with copper must be an oxide of nitrogen (like N₂O or NO) or pure O₂. NO₂ is acidic and would have been absorbed in tube #2. Let's assume the gas is N₂O, a common decomposition product of ammonium nitrate. The reaction is Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂.\n    *   To provide 0.05 mol of O atoms, 0.05 mol of N₂O must have reacted.\n    *   This reaction also produces 0.05 mol of N₂.\n    *   The final 0.10 mol of N₂ (Gas C) consists of this 0.05 mol of N₂ from the reaction plus the N₂ that was originally present in the gas mixture.\n    *   Therefore, the original decomposition must have produced: 0.10 mol (total N₂) - 0.05 mol (from N₂O reaction) = 0.05 mol of N₂.\n*   So, the gaseous products of the decomposition are:\n    *   **0.20 mol H₂O**\n    *   **0.05 mol N₂O**\n    *   **0.05 mol N₂**\n\n**4. Determine the elemental composition of the original salts:**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products came from the initial salts A and B.\n\n*   **Total moles of Hydrogen (H):** 0.20 mol H₂O × 2 H/H₂O = **0.40 mol H**\n*   **Total moles of Nitrogen (N):** (0.05 mol N₂ × 2 N/N₂) + (0.05 mol N₂O × 2 N/N₂O) = 0.10 + 0.10 = **0.20 mol N**\n*   **Total moles of Oxygen (O):** (0.20 mol H₂O × 1 O/H₂O) + (0.05 mol N₂O × 1 O/N₂O) = 0.20 + 0.05 = **0.25 mol O**\n\n**5. Determine the combined formula of salts A and B:**\n\nThe problem states that the initial mixture was **equimolar**. This means we have some number of moles, `n`, of salt A and an equal number of moles, `n`, of salt B. The elemental composition we found (0.40 mol H, 0.20 mol N, 0.25 mol O) represents the atoms contained in `n` molecules of A plus `n` molecules of B.\n\nThe ratio of the atoms in one combined unit of (A+B) is the same as the ratio of moles we calculated:\nRatio H : N : O = 0.40 : 0.20 : 0.25\n\nTo convert this to a simple whole number ratio, we can multiply all parts by 20:\nRatio H : N : O = (0.40 × 20) : (0.20 × 20) : (0.25 × 20) = 8 : 4 : 5\n\nThis means the combined chemical formula for one formula unit of salt A plus one formula unit of salt B is **H₈N₄O₅**.\n\n**6. Calculate the total number of atoms:**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (meaning, in one formula unit of A plus one formula unit of B). We simply sum the atoms in our combined formula:\n\nTotal atoms = (atoms of H) + (atoms of N) + (atoms of O)\nTotal atoms = 8 + 4 + 5 = 17\n\nThis logic can be verified with a python script.\n\n```python\n# Moles of H2O from tube 1\nmoles_h2o = 3.60 / 18.0\n\n# Moles of O atoms that reacted with copper in tube 3\nmoles_o_reacted = 0.80 / 16.0\n\n# Moles of inert gas C from STP volume\nmoles_gas_c = 2.24 / 22.4\n\n# Assuming the oxidizing gas is N2O and inert gas is N2.\n# Reaction: Cu + N2O -> CuO + N2\n# Moles of N2O needed to provide 0.05 mol O is 0.05 mol.\nmoles_n2o = moles_o_reacted\n\n# Moles of N2 produced in the copper tube reaction\nmoles_n2_from_reaction = moles_n2o\n\n# The total N2 collected (gas C) is the sum of N2 from the original decomposition and N2 from the copper tube reaction.\n# So, moles of N2 from original decomposition = total moles N2 - moles N2 from reaction\nmoles_n2_from_decomp = moles_gas_c - moles_n2_from_reaction\n\n# Total moles of each element in the original salts\ntotal_moles_H = moles_h2o * 2\ntotal_moles_N = (moles_n2_from_decomp * 2) + (moles_n2o * 2)\ntotal_moles_O = (moles_h2o * 1) + (moles_n2o * 1)\n\n# The ratio of moles is the ratio of atoms in the combined formula unit of (A + B).\n# The ratio is H:N:O = 0.4 : 0.2 : 0.25.\n# To find the simplest integer ratio, we can divide by the smallest value and then scale.\n# A simpler way is to find a common multiplier.

    "**Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Experimental Data:**\n    *   **Initial state:** An equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B.

Common decomposition products of nitrogen-containing salts are N₂O and NO. Since NO₂ is ruled out, let's consider N₂O.\n    *   The reaction in Tube №3 would be: Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂.\n    *   To provide 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms (for CuO), 0.05 mol of N₂O must have reacted.

    "The problem has been solved correctly in the previous steps. Here is a summary of the logical procedure leading to the final answer.\n\n**1. Data Analysis:**\n*   **Tube 1 (H₂O absorber):** Mass increased by 3.60 g. This means 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol of H₂O** was produced.\n*   **Tube 2 (Acidic gas absorber):** No mass change, so no acidic gases (CO₂, SO₂, NO₂) were formed. The salts do not contain carbon or sulfur.\n*   **Tube 3 (Reacts with O₂/N₂O):** Mass increased by 0.80 g. This is the mass of oxygen atoms transferred to the copper. Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol of O atoms**.\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** 2.24 L at STP. This inert gas is N₂. Moles = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol of N₂**.\n\n**2. Reconstructing the Decomposition Products:**\n*   The oxidizing gas that reacted in Tube 3 must have been N₂O, as it's a common decomposition product and isn't acidic. The reaction is Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂.\n*   To provide 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms, **0.05 mol of N₂O** must have reacted. This reaction also produced 0.05 mol of N₂.\n*   The total 0.10 mol of N₂ collected at the end is the sum of N₂ from the original decomposition plus the 0.05 mol of N₂ from the N₂O reaction.\n*   Therefore, the original decomposition must have produced 0.10 - 0.05 = **0.05 mol of N₂**.\n*   In summary, the thermal decomposition produced: **0.20 mol H₂O, 0.05 mol N₂O, and 0.05 mol N₂.**\n\n**3. Determining the Elemental Composition:**\n*   From the products, we can find the total moles of each element in the original salt mixture.\n    *   **Moles H:** 0.20 mol H₂O × 2 = **0.40 mol H**\n    *   **Moles N:** (0.05 mol N₂ × 2) + (0.05 mol N₂O × 2) = **0.20 mol N**\n    *   **Moles O:** (0.20 mol H₂O × 1) + (0.05 mol N₂O × 1) = **0.25 mol O**\n\n**4. Calculating the Total Number of Atoms:**\n*   The mole ratio of elements in the combined salts (A+B) is H:N:O = 0.40 : 0.20 : 0.25.\n*   To get the simplest whole-number ratio for the atoms in a combined formula unit of (A+B), we multiply by 20:\n    H: (0.40 × 20) = 8\n    N: (0.20 × 20) = 4\n    O: (0.25 × 20) = 5\n*   The combined formula representing one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B is **H₈N₄O₅**.\n*   The total number of atoms is the sum of the subscripts: 8 + 4 + 5 = **17**.\n\n<<<A>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\n\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\n\nIf you lack the related knowledge, you can use the Google Search Tool to search the web and get the information.\nYou can call a search query with the format of <search>your search query</search>, e.g., <search>Who is the current president of US?</search>. The searched results will be returned between <information> and </information>.\nOnce the search query is complete, stop the generation. Then, the search platform will return the searched results.\n\nIf you need to search the web, do not generate code in the same response. Vice versa. You can also solve the question without code and searching, just by your textual reasoning.\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code or search queries to solve the problem.\n\n    question: An equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated to 200°C without air. In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (№1), Ca(OH)2 (№2) solution, and red-hot copper (№3). Results: the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube №3). The weight of the second tube has not changed. As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.\n\nA) 17\nB) 13\nC) 15\nD) 19\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n",
