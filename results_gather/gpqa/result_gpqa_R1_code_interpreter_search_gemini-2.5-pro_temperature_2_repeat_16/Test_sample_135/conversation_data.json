    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Vector Field:**\n    The problem states that the vector field `f(r)` has a magnitude of `1/r^2` and points in the radial direction from the origin. In spherical coordinates, this can be written as:\n    `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r̂`\n    where `r` is the radial distance from the origin and `r̂` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    We need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field, `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`, over the volume `V` of a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n3.  **Apply the Divergence Theorem:**\n    The Divergence Theorem provides a powerful tool to solve this kind of problem. It relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the surface integral of the flux of the field through the closed surface that bounds the volume. The theorem states:\n    `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n    where `S` is the closed surface enclosing the volume `V`. In our case, `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n\n4.  **Set up the Surface Integral:**\n    We need to evaluate the right-hand side of the Divergence Theorem, the surface integral `∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`.\n\n    *   **Vector Field on the Surface (f):** On the surface of the sphere, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So, the vector field on the surface is:\n        `f(r=R) = (1/R^2) * r̂`\n\n    *   **Differential Surface Area Vector (dS):** For a sphere, the differential surface area element `dS` always points outward in the radial direction. Its magnitude is `dS = R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ`. So, the vector `dS` is:\n        `dS = (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r̂`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Dot Product (f ⋅ dS):**\n    Now we take the dot product of `f` and `dS` on the surface of the sphere:\n    `f ⋅ dS = [ (1/R^2) * r̂ ] ⋅ [ (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r̂ ]`\n    Since `r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1`, the dot product simplifies to:\n    `f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * (R^2) * sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n    `f ⋅ dS = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Integral:**\n    Now we integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for spherical coordinates are `θ` from 0 to `π` and `φ` from 0 to `2π`.\n    `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_φ=0^(2π) ∫_θ=0^π sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n    We can solve this integral in two parts:\n    *   **Inner integral (with respect to θ):**\n        `∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\n    *   **Outer integral (with respect to φ):**\n        `∫_0^(2π) (2) dφ = 2 * [φ]_0^(2π) = 2 * (2π - 0) = 4π`\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    According to the Divergence Theorem, the value of the original volume integral is equal to the value of this surface integral.\n    `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`\n\n    **Note on the Singularity:** If one were to calculate the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` directly, one would find it to be zero for all `r ≠ 0`. However, the field is singular at the origin (`r=0`), and the divergence at this point is a Dirac delta function, `∇ ⋅ (r̂/r^2) = 4πδ³(r)`. Integrating `4πδ³(r)` over a volume containing the origin also yields `4π`. The Divergence Theorem conveniently handles this singularity by shifting the calculation to the boundary surface where the field is well-defined.\n\nThe calculated value is `4π`, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
