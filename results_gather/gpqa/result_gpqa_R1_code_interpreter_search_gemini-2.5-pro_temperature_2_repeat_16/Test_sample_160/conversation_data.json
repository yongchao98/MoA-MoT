    "*   **Analysis of λ1 (Mean Free Path of Gas Molecules):**\n    *   λ1 represents the mean free path of the residual gas molecules within the sample compartment.\n    *   This is the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with another gas molecule.\n    *   The formula for this mean free path is given by:\n        λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n        where:\n        *   `n` is the number density of the gas molecules.\n        *   `σ_gg` is the collision cross-section for a gas molecule with another gas molecule. This is essentially determined by the physical size (diameter) of the molecules (`σ_gg = π * d²`, where d is the molecular diameter). It represents a \"hard-sphere\" collision.\n\n*   **Analysis of λ2 (Mean Free Path of Electrons):**\n    *   λ2 represents the mean free path of the electrons from the high-energy beam.\n    *   This is the average distance an electron travels before it is scattered by a gas molecule.\n    *   The formula for this mean free path is:\n        λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n        where:\n        *   `n` is the same number density of gas molecules as above.\n        *   `σ_eg` is the collision cross-section for an electron scattering off a gas molecule.\n\n*   **Comparing the Collision Cross-Sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg):**\n    1.  **Gas-Gas Collision (σ_gg):** This is a collision between two neutral particles. The interaction is short-ranged and can be approximated as a physical \"billiard ball\" collision. The cross-section is related to the physical dimensions of the molecules.\n    2.  **Electron-Gas Collision (σ_eg):** This is a collision between a high-energy charged particle (the electron) and a neutral atom/molecule. The electron does not need to physically \"hit\" the gas molecule in a billiard-ball sense. Instead, it interacts with the electromagnetic field of the atom, which consists of the positively charged nucleus and the negatively charged electron cloud. This is primarily a Coulombic interaction (scattering).\n    3.  **Key Difference:** The range of the Coulomb interaction is much longer than the range of the forces governing hard-sphere collisions between neutral molecules. An electron can be significantly deflected (scattered) even when passing at a relatively large distance from the atom's nucleus. Consequently, the \"effective target area\" that the gas molecule presents to an incoming electron (`σ_eg`) is much larger than the physical cross-sectional area it presents to another gas molecule (`σ_gg`).\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   Because the electron scattering cross-section is much larger than the gas-gas kinetic cross-section (`σ_eg > σ_gg`), the denominator in the mean free path formula for electrons is larger.\n    *   `λ1 = 1 / (constant * σ_gg)`\n    *   `λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)`\n    *   Since `σ_eg > σ_gg` and `n` is the same for both scenarios, it follows that the mean free path for the electrons (λ2) must be shorter than the mean free path for the gas molecules (λ1).\n    *   Therefore, λ2 < λ1.\n\n<<<C>>>"
