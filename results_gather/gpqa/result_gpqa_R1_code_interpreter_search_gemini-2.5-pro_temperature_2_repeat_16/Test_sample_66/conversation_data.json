    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the initial state of the system.**\n    The problem states that the system of two electrons is in a coupled angular momentum state described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   $l_1 = 1$: Orbital angular momentum quantum number of the first electron (since it's in a p orbital).\n    *   $l_2 = 1$: Orbital angular momentum quantum number of the second electron (also in a p orbital).\n    *   $l = 2$: Total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the two-electron system.\n    *   $m = -1$: The quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum.\n\n2.  **Understand the measurement being performed.**\n    A measurement is made of the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum for each electron, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The possible outcomes of these measurements are given by the eigenvalues $m_{l1}\\hbar$ and $m_{l2}\\hbar$, where $m_{l1}$ and $m_{l2}$ are the magnetic quantum numbers for each electron. Since $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$, the possible values for $m_{l1}$ and $m_{l2}$ are \\{-1, 0, 1\\}.\n\n3.  **Identify the specific outcome whose probability we need to find.**\n    The question asks for the joint probability of getting the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ as $-\\hbar$ AND the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$.\n    *   $L_{1z}$ eigenvalue is $-\\hbar$ means $m_{l1}\\hbar = -\\hbar$, so $m_{l1} = -1$.\n    *   $L_{2z}$ eigenvalue is $-\\hbar$ means $m_{l2}\\hbar = -\\hbar$, so $m_{l2} = -1$.\n    This corresponds to finding the system in the uncoupled state $|l_1, l_2, m_{l1}, m_{l2}\\rangle = |1, 1, -1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Apply the principle of conservation of angular momentum.**\n    The total z-component of angular momentum, $L_z$, is the sum of the individual components: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n    The initial state $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the total z-component operator $L_z$ with a well-defined eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$. This means that any measurement of the total z-component of angular momentum must yield $-1\\hbar$.\n\n5.  **Relate the initial state to the measured outcome.**\n    If a measurement of the individual components yields $m_{l1}$ and $m_{l2}$, the total z-component for that outcome is $m' = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$. Due to the conservation of angular momentum, this outcome can only occur if the total z-component matches that of the initial state. That is, it's only possible to get outcomes where $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = m$.\n\n6.  **Check if the desired outcome is physically possible.**\n    *   The initial state has $m = -1$.\n    *   The desired outcome has $m_{l1} = -1$ and $m_{l2} = -1$.\n    *   The total z-component for the desired outcome would be $m' = m_{l1} + m_{l2} = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n    Since $m' \\neq m$ (i.e., $-2 \\neq -1$), the desired outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. An outcome that violates a conservation law is physically impossible.\n\n7.  **Conclude the probability.**\n    The probability of a physically impossible event is 0.\n\n**Alternative Method using Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients:**\n\nThe probability of finding the system in the state $|1, 1, -1, -1\\rangle$ after starting from $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$ is given by the square of the amplitude of projection:\n$P = |\\langle 1, 1, -1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$\n\nThe term $\\langle l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2} | l, m \\rangle$ is known as a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. A fundamental property (selection rule) of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is that they are zero unless $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$.\n\nIn this case:\n*   $l_1 = 1, m_{l1} = -1$\n*   $l_2 = 1, m_{l2} = -1$\n*   $l = 2, m = -1$\n\nWe check the selection rule:\n$m_{l1} + m_{l2} = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\nThis is not equal to $m = -1$.\nTherefore, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle$ is 0.\nThe probability is $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\n<<<D>>>"
