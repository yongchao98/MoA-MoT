    "An elegant problem that blends concepts from stellar physics and exoplanetary science. Here's a breakdown of the solution.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Objective:** The primary goal is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, which can be expressed as $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of an exoplanet is determined by the energy it receives from its host star and its own properties. The formula is:\n    $T_{eq} = T_* \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1-A)^{1/4}$\n    where:\n    *   $T_*$ is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   $R_*$ is the star's radius.\n    *   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (the distance from the star).\n    *   $A$ is the planet's Bond albedo (reflectivity).\n\n3.  **Formulating the Ratio:** We can now write the ratio of the two planets' equilibrium temperatures:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_* \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1-A_1)^{1/4}}{T_* \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1-A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\n    The problem states that the planets orbit the same star (so $T_*$ and $R_*$ are the same for both) and have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). This allows for significant simplification:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_2} \\right)^{1/2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}$\n\n    To find the temperature ratio, we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes of the planets' orbits.\n\n4.  **Connecting Orbital Distance to Observational Data:** The provided data comes from the radial velocity (RV) method, which measures the \"wobble\" of the star caused by the orbiting planets. For a planet in a circular orbit, the amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) is given by:\n    $K = \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_*^{2/3}} \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{P} \\right)^{1/3}$\n    where $M_p$ is the planet mass, $M_*$ is the star mass, $P$ is the orbital period, $G$ is the gravitational constant, and $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n\n    From Kepler's Third Law, we know $P^2 \\propto a^3/M_*$. This means $P \\propto \\sqrt{a^3/M_*}$.\n    Substituting this into the equation for K gives us a relationship between K, M_p, and a:\n    $K \\propto \\frac{M_p}{M_*^{2/3}} \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{M_*}{a^3}}\\right)^{1/3} = \\frac{M_p}{M_*^{2/3}} \\frac{M_*^{1/6}}{a^{1/2}} = \\frac{M_p}{M_*^{1/2} a^{1/2}}$\n    (Assuming $\\sin i = 1$, which is a safe assumption because the planets were also detected via the transit method, requiring an edge-on orbit).\n\n5.  **Solving for the Semi-Major Axis Ratio:**\n    From the relationship $K \\propto \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{a}}$, we can rearrange to find $\\sqrt{a} \\propto \\frac{M_p}{K}$.\n    Therefore, we can establish a ratio for the semi-major axes:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{a_2}}{\\sqrt{a_1}}\\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{M_{p,2}/K_2}{M_{p,1}/K_1} \\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n6.  **Calculating the Input Ratios:**\n    *   **Mass Ratio:** $\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}} = \\frac{5 \\text{ Earth masses}}{7 \\text{ Earth masses}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n    *   **RV Amplitude Ratio:** The radial velocity amplitude (K) is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$), since $K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$. Thus, the ratio $K_1/K_2$ is simply the ratio of the Doppler shifts.\n        $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\text{ Å}}{0.04 \\text{ Å}} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n7.  **Calculating the Final Result:** Now we substitute these values back into our equations.\n    *   First, the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n        $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\times \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n    *   Finally, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\n        $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{225}}{\\sqrt{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n8.  **Numerical Calculation:** To compare with the options, we convert the fraction to a decimal.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the fraction 15/28\nresult = 15 / 28\nprint(result)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.5357142857142857\n</execute_result>\n\nThe calculated value is approximately 0.536.
