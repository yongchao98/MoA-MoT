    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing physical principle:** The problem deals with the population of atomic energy levels in the photospheres of stars. The assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) allows us to use the Boltzmann equation to describe the relative populations of these energy levels as a function of temperature.\n\n2.  **State the Boltzmann Equation:** The Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms (N) in two different energy states, an upper state *j* and a lower state *i*, as:\n    N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T)]\n    Where:\n    *   N_j and N_i are the number of atoms in states *j* and *i*.\n    *   g_j and g_i are the statistical weights of the states.\n    *   E_j - E_i = ΔE is the energy difference between the states.\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant (k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n    *   T is the temperature.\n\n3.  **Apply the equation to the two stars:** We are comparing the same transition in two different stars, star_1 and star_2, with temperatures T_1 and T_2, respectively. The properties of the iron atom (g_j, g_i, and ΔE) are the same for both stars.\n\n    *   For star_1:\n        (N_j / N_i)_1 = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\n\n    *   For star_2:\n        (N_j / N_i)_2 = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n4.  **Incorporate the observational data:** The problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... when compared to the iron atoms in star_2\". This means the ratio of atoms in the excited state to the lower state is twice as large for star_1 as it is for star_2.\n    (N_j / N_i)_1 = 2 * (N_j / N_i)_2\n\n5.  **Combine the equations:** Substitute the Boltzmann expressions from step 3 into the relationship from step 4.\n    (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n6.  **Simplify and solve for the temperatures:**\n    *   The factor for the statistical weights, (g_j / g_i), is common to both sides and can be canceled out.\n        exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n    *   Rearrange the equation to isolate the constant '2'.\n        exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] / exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)] = 2\n\n    *   Use the property of exponents (e^a / e^b = e^(a-b)).\n        exp[(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) - (-ΔE / (k * T_2))] = 2\n        exp[(ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)] = 2\n\n    *   Take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides.\n        ln(exp[(ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)]) = ln(2)\n        (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)\n\n    *   Combine the fractions inside the parenthesis by finding a common denominator (T1*T2).\n        (ΔE / k) * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)] = ln(2)\n\n7.  **Substitute the given numerical values:** The problem provides:\n    *   Energy difference ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J\n    *   We know the Boltzmann constant k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K\n    The ratio ΔE / k is therefore:\n    ΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) = 1 K\n\n8.  **Finalize the equation:** Substitute ΔE/k = 1 into the equation derived in step 6.\n    1 * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)] = ln(2)\n    ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\n9.  **Compare with the options:** This result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
