    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **Neutrino Source:** The Sun.\n    *   **Event:** The pp-III branch of the proton-proton chain stops producing neutrinos.\n    *   **Timing:** The event happened about 8.5 minutes ago. Since neutrinos travel from the Sun to the Earth in about 8.3 minutes, this means the consequences of this event are just now observable at Earth.\n    *   **Question:** Calculate the new ratio of neutrino flux in the energy band 700-800 keV (Band 1) to the flux in the energy band 800-900 keV (Band 2).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Solar Neutrino Sources:** We need to identify which solar reactions produce neutrinos in the specified energy ranges. Let's look at the standard solar model (SSM) neutrino sources:\n    *   **pp-I chain:** The primary `p-p` reaction produces low-energy neutrinos (< 420 keV), which do not contribute to either band.\n    *   **pp-II chain:** This branch produces mono-energetic neutrinos from electron capture on Beryllium-7 (`⁷Be`). The vast majority (~90%) of these have an energy of **861 keV**. This is the single most important contributor to **Band 2 (800-900 keV)**. The problem states this reaction continues as normal.\n    *   **pp-III chain:** This branch produces Boron-8 (`⁸B`), which beta-decays, emitting a continuous spectrum of high-energy neutrinos (up to ~15 MeV). These neutrinos contribute to *both* Band 1 and Band 2. **According to the problem, this source of neutrinos disappears.**\n    *   **CNO cycle:** The primary CNO reactions (`¹³N` and `¹⁵O` decay) produce continuous neutrino spectra up to 1.20 MeV and 1.73 MeV, respectively. These reactions contribute a background continuum flux to *both* Band 1 and Band 2. The problem states these reactions continue as normal.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Fluxes *After* the Change:**\n    With the pp-III branch stopped, the `⁸B` neutrino flux is zero. Let's see what's left in each band:\n    *   **Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV):** The `⁸B` neutrinos are gone. The `⁷Be` line is at 861 keV, outside this band. The only remaining source is the continuous spectrum from the **CNO cycle neutrinos**.\n    *   **Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV):** The `⁸B` neutrinos are gone. However, this band contains the extremely strong, mono-energetic **`⁷Be` line at 861 keV**. It also contains the background continuum from the **CNO cycle neutrinos**.\n\n4.  **Compare the Magnitudes:**\n    The core of the problem is comparing the magnitude of the fluxes in the two bands.\n    *   Flux (Band 1) = Flux_CNO (in 700-800 keV window)\n    *   Flux (Band 2) = Flux_⁷Be (line at 861 keV) + Flux_CNO (in 800-900 keV window)\n\n    Let's use approximate values for the total fluxes from the Standard Solar Model:\n    *   Total Flux of the 861 keV `⁷Be` line: `F_⁷Be ≈ 5 x 10⁹ neutrinos / (cm²·s)`\n    *   Total Flux of `¹³N` + `¹⁵O` (CNO) neutrinos: `F_CNO_total ≈ 5 x 10⁸ neutrinos / (cm²·s)`\n\n    The CNO flux is spread over an energy range of ~1.7 MeV. The flux in a small 0.1 MeV wide band (like Band 1) is only a fraction of the total CNO flux. We can estimate it:\n    *   Flux_CNO (in a 0.1 MeV band) ≈ `(Total CNO Flux / Energy Range) * Band Width`\n    *   Flux_CNO (Band 1) ≈ `(5 x 10⁸ / 1.7 MeV) * 0.1 MeV ≈ 3 x 10⁷ neutrinos / (cm²·s)`\n\n    The CNO flux in Band 2 will be of a similar magnitude.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ratio:**\n    Ratio = Flux (Band 1) / Flux (Band 2)\n    Ratio = [Flux_CNO (Band 1)] / [Flux_⁷Be + Flux_CNO (Band 2)]\n\n    Plugging in the estimated values:\n    Ratio ≈ (3 x 10⁷) / (5 x 10⁹ + 3 x 10⁷)\n    Ratio ≈ (3 x 10⁷) / (500 x 10⁷ + 3 x 10⁷)\n    Ratio ≈ 3 / 503\n    Ratio ≈ 0.006\n\n6.  **Select the Closest Answer:**\n    The calculated ratio is approximately 0.006. Let's compare this to the given options:\n    A) 1\n    B) 0.01 (10⁻²)\n    C) 10\n    D) 0.1 (10⁻¹)\n\n    The value `0.006` is very close to `0.01`. The other options are off by orders of magnitude. The key insight is that Band 2 contains the massive `⁷Be` flux, while Band 1 only contains the much smaller CNO continuum flux. This makes the ratio very small.\n\n<<<B>>>"
