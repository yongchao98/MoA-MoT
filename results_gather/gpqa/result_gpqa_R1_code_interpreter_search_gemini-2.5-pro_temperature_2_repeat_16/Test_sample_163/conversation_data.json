    "The user wants me to determine the ratio of the total mass of `system_1` to `system_2`.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Given Information\n**For system_1:**\n-   Orbital Period (P1) = 2 years\n-   Radial Velocity Amplitude of star A (K1a) = 10 km/s\n-   Radial Velocity Amplitude of star B (K1b) = 5 km/s\n\n**For system_2:**\n-   Orbital Period (P2) = 1 year\n-   Radial Velocity Amplitude of star A (K2a) = 15 km/s\n-   Radial Velocity Amplitude of star B (K2b) = 10 km/s\n\n**Crucial Information:**\n-   Both systems are \"eclipsing\" binaries. This is key because it tells us about the inclination angle (i) of the orbit. For an eclipse to occur, the orbit must be viewed nearly edge-on, meaning the inclination angle `i` is very close to 90°. For `i = 90°`, `sin(i) = 1`.\n\n### Step 2: Recall the Relevant Physics Formula\nThe total mass (M_total = M1 + M2) of a double-lined spectroscopic binary system can be determined from the orbital period (P) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities (K1 and K2). The formula derived from Kepler's third law is:\n\nM1 + M2 = [P / (2 * pi * G * sin^3(i))] * (K1 + K2)^3\n\nwhere:\n-   M1, M2 are the masses of the two stars.\n-   P is the orbital period.\n-   K1, K2 are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocity curves.\n-   G is the gravitational constant.\n-   `i` is the inclination of the orbit to the line of sight.\n\n### Step 3: Simplify the Formula Using the Given Information\nSince both systems are eclipsing, we can approximate `sin(i) ≈ 1`, which means `sin^3(i) ≈ 1`. The formula for the total mass (M_total) simplifies to:\n\nM_total ≈ [P / (2 * pi * G)] * (K1 + K2)^3\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Ratio of the Masses\nWe need to find the ratio of the mass of system_1 to the mass of system_2:\nRatio = M_total_1 / M_total_2\n\nRatio = [ (P1 / (2 * pi * G)) * (K1a + K1b)^3 ] / [ (P2 / (2 * pi * G)) * (K2a + K2b)^3 ]\n\nThe constant term `1 / (2 * pi * G)` cancels out from the numerator and the denominator, leaving a simpler expression:\n\nRatio = [ P1 * (K1a + K1b)^3 ] / [ P2 * (K2a + K2b)^3 ]\n\n### Step 5: Substitute the Values and Compute\nNow, I will substitute the given values into this ratio formula. I can use the periods in \"years\" and velocities in \"km/s\" directly, as the units will be consistent in the numerator and denominator and their conversion factors will cancel out.\n\n**For system_1:**\n-   P1 = 2\n-   K1a + K1b = 10 + 5 = 15\n\n**For system_2:**\n-   P2 = 1\n-   K2a + K2b = 15 + 10 = 25\n\n**Calculation:**\nRatio = [ 2 * (15)^3 ] / [ 1 * (25)^3 ]\nRatio = 2 * (15 / 25)^3\nRatio = 2 * (3 / 5)^3\nRatio = 2 * (27 / 125)\nRatio = 54 / 125\n\nTo make the comparison easier, I'll convert this fraction to a decimal.\nRatio = 0.432\n\nThis value is approximately 0.4. To confirm the calculation, I will use a simple Python script.\n\n```python\n# System 1 parameters\nP1 = 2  # years\nK1_total = 10 + 5  # km/s\n\n# System 2 parameters\nP2 = 1  # year\nK2_total = 15 + 10  # km/s\n\n# The ratio of masses is proportional to P * K^3\n# (The constants cancel out)\nratio = (P1 * (K1_total)**3) / (P2 * (K2_total)**3)\n\nprint(ratio)\n```\n\nThe computed value is 0.432, which is closest to the option `C) ~ 0.4`.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem asks for the ratio of the total mass of `system_1` to `system_2`. Let the total mass of `system_1` be M1_total and `system_2` be M2_total. We need to find M1_total / M2_total.\n\n**1. Formula for Total Mass in a Binary System**\n\nFor a double-lined spectroscopic binary system, the total mass (M_total = M_star1 + M_star2) can be related to the orbital period (P) and the radial velocity semi-amplitudes (K1 and K2) using a form of Kepler's third law:\n\nM1 + M2 = (P / (2 * pi * G * sin^3(i))) * (K1 + K2)^3\n\nwhere:\n-   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n-   `i` is the inclination of the orbital plane with respect to the line of sight.\n\n**2. The Significance of \"Eclipsing\" Systems**\n\nThe problem states that both systems are \"eclipsing\". For an eclipse to be observed, the observer's line of sight must be very close to the orbital plane. This means the inclination angle `i` must be close to 90 degrees.\nWhen `i = 90°`, `sin(i) = 1`, and therefore `sin^3(i) = 1`. This simplifies the mass equation considerably, allowing us to estimate the true mass of the system.\n\nThe simplified formula for the total mass is:\n\nM_total ∝ P * (K1 + K2)^3\n\nAll the other terms (`2`, `pi`, `G`, `sin^3(i)`) are constants that will cancel out when we take the ratio of the two systems' masses.\n\n**3. Set Up the Ratio**\n\nWe want to find the ratio M1_total / M2_total:\n\nRatio = [ P1 * (K1a + K1b)^3 ] / [ P2 * (K2a + K2b)^3 ]\n\n**4. Substitute the Given Values**\n\n**For system_1:**\n-   Period (P1) = 2 years\n-   Sum of velocity amplitudes (K1a + K1b) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n**For system_2:**\n-   Period (P2) = 1 year\n-   Sum of velocity amplitudes (K2a + K2b) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nNow, substitute these values into the ratio equation:\n\nRatio = [ 2 * (15)^3 ] / [ 1 * (25)^3 ]\n\n**5. Calculate the Result**\n\nRatio = 2 * (15 / 25)^3\nRatio = 2 * (3 / 5)^3\nRatio = 2 * (27 / 125)\nRatio = 54 / 125\nRatio = 0.432\n\nThis value is approximately 0.4. Comparing this result with the given options:\nA) ~ 0.7\nB) ~ 1.2\nC) ~ 0.4\nD) ~ 0.6\n\nThe calculated ratio of 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
