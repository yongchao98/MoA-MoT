    "*   **Core Principle**: The relationship between the lifetime of a quantum state and the uncertainty in its energy is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time. The principle is mathematically stated as:\n    \n    $\\Delta E \\cdot \\Delta t \\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$\n    \n    where:\n    *   $\\Delta E$ is the uncertainty in energy (also called the natural line width).\n    *   $\\Delta t$ is the uncertainty in time, which corresponds to the lifetime of the state ($\\tau$).\n    *   $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant ($1.054 \\times 10^{-34}$ J·s or $6.582 \\times 10^{-16}$ eV·s).\n    \n    For order-of-magnitude calculations, we can use the approximation $\\Delta E \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{\\tau}$.\n\n*   **Calculate the Energy Uncertainty for Each State**:\n    \n    1.  **State 1**:\n        *   Lifetime, $\\tau_1 = 10^{-9}$ s.\n        *   The energy uncertainty is $\\Delta E_1 \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{\\tau_1}$.\n        *   Using $\\hbar \\approx 6.582 \\times 10^{-16}$ eV·s:\n            $\\Delta E_1 \\approx \\frac{6.582 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ eV·s}}{10^{-9} \\text{ s}} = 6.582 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV.\n    \n    2.  **State 2**:\n        *   Lifetime, $\\tau_2 = 10^{-8}$ s.\n        *   The energy uncertainty is $\\Delta E_2 \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{\\tau_2}$.\n        *   $\\Delta E_2 \\approx \\frac{6.582 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ eV·s}}{10^{-8} \\text{ s}} = 6.582 \\times 10^{-8}$ eV.\n\n*   **Condition for Resolvability**:\n    \n    To \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, their energy difference, $|E_1 - E_2|$, must be greater than the uncertainty (or width) of the energy levels. Since the levels themselves are \"fuzzy\" (have a range of possible energies), their separation must be larger than their combined fuzziness.\n    \n    The state with the shorter lifetime ($\\tau_1 = 10^{-9}$ s) has the larger energy uncertainty ($\\Delta E_1 \\approx 6.6 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV). This wider energy level is the limiting factor for resolution. Therefore, the energy difference between the two states must be significantly larger than this uncertainty.\n    \n    The condition is: $|E_1 - E_2| \\gg \\Delta E_1$.\n    So, we need $|E_1 - E_2| \\gg 6.6 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV.\n\n*   **Evaluate the Options**:\n    \n    *   A) $10^{-11}$ eV: This is much smaller than the required separation ($10^{-11} \\ll 6.6 \\times 10^{-7}$). Not resolvable.\n    *   B) $10^{-9}$ eV: This is much smaller than the required separation ($10^{-9} \\ll 6.6 \\times 10^{-7}$). Not resolvable.\n    *   C) $10^{-8}$ eV: This is smaller than the required separation ($10^{-8} < 6.6 \\times 10^{-7}$). Not resolvable.\n    *   D) $10^{-4}$ eV: This is much larger than the required separation ($10^{-4} \\gg 6.6 \\times 10^{-7}$). The levels would be clearly resolvable.\n\nThus, an energy difference of $10^{-4}$ eV would be sufficient to clearly distinguish the two energy levels.\n\n<<<D>>>"
