    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process to identify the unknown compound from the given spectral data.\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n    *   **Molecular Ion (M+) Peak:** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates that the molecular weight of the compound is 156 g/mol.\n    *   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (two mass units higher than the molecular ion) with an intensity of about one-third (32%) of the M+ peak (100%). This M+ to M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 is a tell-tale sign of the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of its isotopes, ~75% ³⁵Cl and ~25% ³⁷Cl).\n    *   **Conclusion from MS:** The compound has a molecular weight of 156 and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The significant broadening is caused by extensive hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n    *   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This peak falls squarely in the region for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Given the presence of the broad O-H peak, this carbonyl is identified as belonging to the carboxylic acid group.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n3.  **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis:**\n    *   **Signal at 11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A chemical shift greater than 10 ppm is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton. The integration of 1H confirms it is a single proton, and its singlet nature (s) indicates it has no adjacent protons to couple with, which is typical for a -COOH proton. This corroborates the IR data.\n    *   **Signals at 8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (typically 7-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic fingerprint for a *para* (1,4-) disubstituted benzene ring. The symmetry of the *para* substitution means there are only two types of aromatic protons, and each type is split into a doublet by its single neighbor on the ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from NMR:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid group and a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\n4.  **Putting It All Together and Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   From MS, we have CₓHᵧCl₁O₂ (since we know it's a carboxylic acid) with a mass of 156.\n    *   From NMR, we know it's a benzene ring with two substituents in a *para* arrangement.\n    *   The two substituents must be the chlorine atom (from MS) and the carboxylic acid group (from IR and NMR).\n    *   This leads to the structure of **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\nLet's check if this structure is consistent with all the data and the other options.\n\n*   **A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** MW=156, but it is not a carboxylic acid and would have a different NMR aromatic pattern (3 distinct signals). Incorrect.\n*   **B) Phenyl chloroformate:** MW=156, but it lacks the carboxylic acid group (no broad O-H in IR, no signal at 11 ppm in NMR). Incorrect.\n*   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a carboxylic acid with a chlorine atom (MW=156). However, the substituents are *ortho* (1,2-), which would result in a more complex splitting pattern for the 4 aromatic protons, not two simple doublets. Incorrect.\n*   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This structure has a molecular weight of 156 and contains a chlorine atom, consistent with the MS data. It is a carboxylic acid, consistent with the IR and the 11.0 ppm NMR signal. It is *para*-disubstituted, which perfectly explains the two doublets (for 2H each) seen in the aromatic region of the NMR spectrum. This structure fits all the provided data perfectly.\n\n<<<D>>>"
