    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Step-by-step Synthesis**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating, forming product 1.**\n    *   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), Bromine (Br2), Pyridine, Acetic anhydride.\n    *   **Reaction:** This combination of reagents suggests an α-bromination of the carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The alpha-carbon of acetic acid is the methyl group. Acetic anhydride can help form a more reactive enol or enolate intermediate, and pyridine acts as a base catalyst and scavenges the HBr byproduct.\n    *   CH₃COOH + Br₂ → BrCH₂COOH + HBr\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid.\n\n2.  **Step 2: 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2.**\n    *   **Reactants:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH), Ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH), and H₂SO₄ (catalyst).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification, where a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol to form an ester.\n    *   BrCH₂COOH + CH₃CH₂OH  --H⁺--> BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃ + H₂O\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate.\n\n3.  **Step 3: 2 is treated with sodium cyanide, forming product 3.**\n    *   **Reactants:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃) and Sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a good nucleophile and displaces the bromide (Br⁻), which is a good leaving group.\n    *   BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃ + NaCN → NC-CH₂COOCH₂CH₃ + NaBr\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate. This molecule has an acidic methylene group (CH₂) flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (a nitrile and an ester).\n\n4.  **Step 4: 3 is then treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming final product 4.**\n    *   **Reactants:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH₂COOCH₂CH₃), excess Sodium hydride (NaH), and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH₂)₅-Br).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a sequential double alkylation leading to cyclization.\n        *   **First Deprotonation:** NaH is a strong base that removes one of the acidic α-protons from ethyl cyanoacetate to form a resonance-stabilized enolate.\n            NC-CH₂COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n        *   **First Alkylation (Sₙ2):** The enolate attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane.\n            [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH₂)₅-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅-Br + Br⁻\n        *   **Second Deprotonation:** The product from the first alkylation still has one acidic α-proton. The \"excess\" NaH deprotonates this proton.\n            NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅-Br + NaH → [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH₂)₅-Br]⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n        *   **Second Alkylation (Intramolecular Sₙ2):** The carbanion in this intermediate attacks the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromide ion and forming a ring. The ring is composed of the α-carbon and the five carbons from the pentyl chain, creating a stable 6-membered ring.\n    *   **Final Product 4:** The resulting structure is **1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane**.\n\n### **¹H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n\nNow, we must determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen environments in Product 4.\n\nThe structure of Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring substituted at C1 with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n```\n      EtOOC\n          \\\n           C ----- CN   (C1)\n         /   \\\n (C6) H2C     CH2 (C2)\n     /         \\\n (C5) H2C           CH2 (C3)\n     \\         /\n       ---CH2---    (C4)\n```\n\n**Symmetry:**\nThe molecule is achiral. It has a plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the C-COOEt bond axis. This symmetry plane means:\n*   The C2 and C6 positions are equivalent.\n*   The C3 and C5 positions are equivalent.\n*   The C4 position is unique.\n*   The C1 position is unique.\n\n**Signal Analysis:**\n\nWe need to count the number of non-equivalent sets of protons.\n\n1.  **The Ethyl Group (-O-CH₂-CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent. **(1 signal)**\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (-O-CH₂-) are equivalent. **(1 signal)**\n    *   This gives 2 signals from the ethyl group.\n\n2.  **The Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   Because C1 is substituted with two different groups (CN and COOEt), the environments on either side are different. This has important consequences for the geminal protons (protons on the same carbon). Even with rapid chair-chair interconversion, geminal protons on the ring will be diastereotopic.\n    *   **Protons at C2 and C6 (4H total):** The two positions are equivalent by symmetry. However, the two protons on C2 (and C6) are diastereotopic because C1 is a prochiral center. This means they are in different chemical environments. One set of two equivalent protons (one on C2, one on C6) will produce one signal, and the other set of two protons will produce a different signal. **(2 signals)**\n    *   **Protons at C3 and C5 (4H total):** The same logic applies. C3 and C5 are equivalent by symmetry, but the two geminal protons on each of these carbons are diastereotopic due to the overall asymmetry of the molecule radiating from C1. **(2 signals)**\n    *   **Protons at C4 (2H total):** The C4 carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. However, the two protons on C4 are diastereotopic. In any given chair conformation, one proton is axial and the other is equatorial, and their environments relative to the C1 substituents are different. Since the two chair conformers (one with COOEt axial, one with COOEt equatorial) are not equally populated due to sterics, these two protons do not average to the same chemical shift and remain distinct. **(2 signals)**\n\n**Total Count:**\n*   From ethyl group: 2 signals\n*   From ring positions C2/C6: 2 signals\n*   From ring positions C3/C5: 2 signals\n*   From ring position C4: 2 signals\n\nTotal number of distinct hydrogen signals = 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = **8**.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
