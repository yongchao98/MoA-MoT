    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the major products of the two reactions.\n\n### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> A\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type and reactants:** This is a classic Michael Addition reaction.\n    *   **Nucleophile:** An enolate will be formed from the ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, using the base.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt) is the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, sterically hindered base.\n\n2.  **Enolate Formation:** The base removes an acidic α-proton from the ketone to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   The ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   The α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl C=O at C1) are C2 and C6.\n    *   The carbon at position C2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group attached, making it a quaternary carbon with no α-protons.\n    *   The carbon at position C6 has a methyl group and one α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, the t-BuOK base can only deprotonate the C6 position, forming a single, specific enolate where the double bond is between C1 and C6. The C6 carbon of this enolate will act as the nucleophile.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition:** The C6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The nucleophilic enolate attacks the C=C double bond of ethyl acrylate (H₂C=CH-COOEt). The attack occurs at the β-carbon (the CH₂ group).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the acrylate. After protonation (from t-BuOH formed in the first step or during workup), the product is formed.\n    *   The original ketone structure remains, but now has a `–CH₂–CH₂–COOEt` (an ethoxycarbonylethyl) group attached to C6.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product A:**\n    *   The resulting molecule has the following groups on the cyclohexanone ring:\n        *   C1: Carbonyl group (C=O)\n        *   C2: An ethyl group and a methyl group\n        *   C6: A methyl group and the new `–CH₂CH₂COOEt` group\n    *   To name this product according to IUPAC rules where the ester is the principal functional group, it is named as an ethyl propanoate.\n        *   The main chain is `ethyl ...-propanoate`: `(substituent)-CH₂(β)-CH₂(α)-COOEt`.\n        *   The cyclohexanone ring is the substituent, attached at C3 of the propanoate chain.\n        *   Let's number the cyclohexyl substituent ring starting from the point of attachment (the original C6 of the ketone) as C1'.\n        *   The carbonyl group is on the next carbon, so it is at C2' (`2-oxo`).\n        *   The original C2 of the ketone is now at C3' of the substituent ring. It carries an ethyl and a methyl group (`3-ethyl-3-methyl`).\n        *   The original C6-methyl group is on the attachment carbon, C1' (`1-methyl`).\n    *   Combining these pieces gives the name: **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) ---> B\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type and reactants:** This is also a Michael Addition.\n    *   **Nucleophile:** The acidic α-protons of 1-nitropropane will be removed by KOH to form a carbanion (a nitronate ion). The nitro group (–NO₂) is strongly electron-withdrawing, making the α-protons acidic.\n        *   `CH₃CH₂C**H₂**–NO₂` + OH⁻ → `CH₃CH₂CH⁻–NO₂` + H₂O\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as trans-crotononitrile, `CH₃–CH=CH–C≡N`).\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n\n2.  **Michael Addition:** The α-carbon of the nitronate ion attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n    *   The nucleophile (`CH₃CH₂C⁻HNO₂`) attacks the C=C double bond of but-2-enenitrile (`CH₃–CH(β)=CH(α)–CN`). The attack occurs at the β-carbon (the `CH` group attached to the methyl).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   `[CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)]` attacks `[CH(CH₃)-CH-CN]`.\n    *   After the attack, an intermediate enolate/nitrile anion is formed, which is then protonated by water.\n\n3.  **Structure and Naming of Product B:**\n    *   The resulting product's carbon skeleton is:\n        `CH₃–CH₂–CH(NO₂) – CH(CH₃)–CH₂–CN`\n    *   To name this product, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (–CN). The carbon of the nitrile group is assigned as C1.\n    *   We find the longest carbon chain that includes C1. It is a 6-carbon chain (a hexane derivative). The parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Now, we number the chain starting from the nitrile carbon and locate the substituents:\n        *   C1: –CN\n        *   C2: –CH₂–\n        *   C3: –CH(CH₃)– (a methyl group at position 3)\n        *   C4: –CH(NO₂)– (a nitro group at position 4)\n        *   C5: –CH₂–\n        *   C6: –CH₃\n    *   Combining the pieces gives the name: **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate (Incorrect A), B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect B)\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate (Correct A), B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect B)\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate (Incorrect A), B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Correct B)\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate (Correct A), B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Correct B)\n\nOption D correctly identifies both major products.\n\n<<<D>>>"
