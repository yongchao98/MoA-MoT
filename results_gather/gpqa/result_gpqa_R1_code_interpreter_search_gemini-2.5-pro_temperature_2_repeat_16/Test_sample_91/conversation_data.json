    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Determine the Molecular Formula**\n    The chemical structure is given as `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`.\n    We need to count the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms.\n    -   Number of Carbon (C) atoms: 2 (in (CH3)2) + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 (in CH3) + 1 + 1 + 2 (in (CH3)2) = 12 carbons.\n    -   Number of Hydrogen (H) atoms: 2*3 (in (CH3)2) + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 (in CH3) + 2 + 1 + 2*3 (in (CH3)2) = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22 hydrogens.\n    The molecular formula is C12H22.\n\n2.  **Count the Number of Bonds**\n    To calculate the enthalpy of formation using bond energies, we need to know the number of each type of bond in one molecule.\n    -   **C-H bonds**: The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is 22.\n    -   **C=C bonds**: The structure contains two double bonds (`C=C`).\n    -   **C-C bonds**: For an acyclic (non-ring) molecule, the total number of bonds can be calculated as `Number of Atoms - 1`.\n        Total atoms = 12 (C) + 22 (H) = 34.\n        Total bonds = 34 - 1 = 33.\n        We can find the number of C-C single bonds by subtracting the other bonds from the total:\n        Number of C-C bonds = Total bonds - (Number of C=C bonds) - (Number of C-H bonds)\n        Number of C-C bonds = 33 - 2 - 22 = 9.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound (ΔH_atom,compound)**\n    This is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the gaseous compound.\n    ΔH_atom,compound = (No. of C-C bonds × BE(C-C)) + (No. of C=C bonds × BE(C=C)) + (No. of C-H bonds × BE(C-H))\n    Using the given bond energies:\n    -   BE(C-C) = 200 kJ/mol\n    -   BE(C=C) = 300 kJ/mol\n    -   BE(C-H) = 400 kJ/mol\n    ΔH_atom,compound = (9 × 200) + (2 × 300) + (22 × 400)\n    ΔH_atom,compound = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = 11200 kJ/mol.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Elements (ΔH_atom,elements)**\n    This is the enthalpy change for converting the elements in their standard states to gaseous atoms. The formation reaction for C12H22 is:\n    12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n    The atomization of the elements is for the process: 12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → 12 C(g) + 22 H(g).\n    Using the given data:\n    -   Enthalpy of atomization of carbon, ΔH_atom(C) = 1000 kJ/mol (for C(s) → C(g)).\n    -   Bond energy of H-H, BE(H-H) = 100 kJ/mol (for H2(g) → 2H(g)).\n    ΔH_atom,elements = (12 × ΔH_atom(C)) + (11 × BE(H-H))\n    ΔH_atom,elements = (12 × 1000) + (11 × 100)\n    ΔH_atom,elements = 12000 + 1100 = 13100 kJ/mol.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\n    The enthalpy of formation is calculated using Hess's Law:\n    ΔH_f = ΔH_atom,elements - ΔH_atom,compound\n    ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = 1900 kJ/mol.\n\n6.  **Convert the Units**\n    The calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. Looking at the options, we see values in kJ/g. We need to convert our result to these units by dividing by the molar mass of the compound.\n    -   Molar mass of C12H22 = (12 × 12.0 g/mol) + (22 × 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n    -   ΔH_f (kJ/g) = ΔH_f (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\n    -   ΔH_f (kJ/g) = 1900 / 166 ≈ 11.4457... kJ/g.\n\nThis value is approximately 11.44 kJ/g.\n\nTo confirm the calculation:\n```python\n# Number of atoms and bonds\nnum_c_atoms = 12\nnum_h_atoms = 22\nnum_c_c_bonds = 9\nnum_c_eq_c_bonds = 2\nnum_c_h_bonds = 22\n\n# Given energy values in kJ/mol\nh_atom_c = 1000\nbe_h_h = 100\nbe_c_c = 200\nbe_c_eq_c = 300\nbe_c_h = 400\n\n# Molar masses in g/mol\nmolar_mass_c = 12.0\nmolar_mass_h = 1.0\n\n# Enthalpy of atomization of the compound\nh_atom_compound = (num_c_c_bonds * be_c_c) + (num_c_eq_c_bonds * be_c_eq_c) + (num_c_h_bonds * be_c_h)\n\n# Enthalpy of atomization of the elements\nnum_h2_molecules = num_h_atoms / 2\nh_atom_elements = (num_c_atoms * h_atom_c) + (num_h2_molecules * be_h_h)\n\n# Enthalpy of formation in kJ/mol\nh_formation_mol = h_atom_elements - h_atom_compound\n\n# Molar mass of the compound\nmolar_mass_compound = (num_c_atoms * molar_mass_c) + (num_h_atoms * molar_mass_h)\n\n# Enthalpy of formation in kJ/g\nh_formation_gram = h_formation_mol / molar_mass_compound\n\nprint(f\"{h_formation_gram:.2f}\")\n```\n>>>\n11.45\n<<<D>>>",
