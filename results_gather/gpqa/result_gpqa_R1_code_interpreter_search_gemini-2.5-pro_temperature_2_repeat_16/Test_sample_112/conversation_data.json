    "**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data:**\n\n    *   **FTIR (Fourier-Transform Infrared) Spectroscopy:** This technique identifies functional groups present in a molecule based on how they absorb infrared radiation.\n        *   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature for the O-H stretch of a hydrogen-bonded hydroxyl group. The significant broadness (often spanning from ~2500 to 3300 cm⁻¹) is highly characteristic of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group, where strong dimer hydrogen bonding occurs. While alcohols also have O-H groups, their peaks are typically less broad.\n        *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the region for a carbonyl (C=O) double bond stretch. Carboxylic acids absorb around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹. This, combined with the broad O-H peak, provides strong evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group.\n        *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the typical range for an alkene (C=C) double bond stretch.\n\n    *   **¹H NMR (Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) Spectroscopy:** This technique provides information about the chemical environment of hydrogen atoms (protons) in a molecule.\n        *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl-hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbon atoms of a C=C double bond. The presence of these peaks definitively confirms the existence of an alkene group in the unknown compound.\n\n    *   **Mass Spectrometry (MS):** This technique measures the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of the molecule and its fragments after ionization.\n        *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a crucial piece of evidence. We need to determine what common fragment has this mass.\n            *   Calculating the mass of the carboxylic acid group, [COOH]⁺:\n                *   Mass = (1 x Carbon) + (1 x Hydrogen) + (2 x Oxygen)\n                *   Mass = (1 x 12.01) + (1 x 1.01) + (2 x 16.00) ≈ 45.0\n            *   This m/z = 45 fragment is a very common and diagnostic cleavage for carboxylic acids.\n\n2.  **Synthesize the Findings:**\n\n    *   The FTIR and Mass Spec data combined (broad O-H, C=O, and m/z=45 fragment) overwhelmingly indicate the presence of a **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)**.\n    *   The FTIR and ¹H NMR data (C=C stretch and vinyl-hydrogen signals) both confirm the presence of an **alkene group (C=C)**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) for the Deduced Structure:**\n\n    *   Our deduced structure contains at least one C=O double bond and one C=C double bond.\n    *   Each double bond corresponds to one degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule must have a minimum of **2 degrees of unsaturation**.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Candidate Formulas:**\n\n    Now, let's calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) for each of the given options to see which one matches our requirement of DBE = 2. The formula for DBE is:\n    DBE = C + 1 - (H / 2)\n    *(where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens. Oxygens do not affect the calculation)*.\n\n    *   **A) C₆H₁₂O:**\n        *   DBE = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = **1**.\n        *   This DBE only accounts for one double bond (or one ring). It cannot accommodate both a C=O and a C=C bond. Also, it has only one oxygen, which contradicts the presence of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n\n    *   **B) C₆H₁₂O₂:**\n        *   DBE = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = **1**.\n        *   This could be a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid). It would have the -COOH group (DBE=1) but would lack the C=C bond. This contradicts the FTIR (1650 cm⁻¹) and NMR data.\n\n    *   **C) C₆H₁₀O:**\n        *   DBE = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = **2**.\n        *   This DBE is correct, but the formula only has one oxygen atom. A carboxylic acid requires two. This is inconsistent with our data.\n\n    *   **D) C₆H₁₀O₂:**\n        *   DBE = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = **2**.\n        *   This formula has **two oxygen atoms**, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n        *   It has **two degrees of unsaturation**, which perfectly accounts for one C=O bond (in the acid) and one C=C bond (in the alkene).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe chemical formula C₆H₁₀O₂ is the only option that is fully consistent with all the provided spectroscopic evidence: a compound containing a carboxylic acid group, an alkene group, and a total of six carbon atoms. An example of such a compound would be hexenoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>"
