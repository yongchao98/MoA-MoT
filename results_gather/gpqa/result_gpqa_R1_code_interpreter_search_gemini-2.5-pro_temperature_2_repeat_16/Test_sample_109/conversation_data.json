    "Both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory have specific requirements for observing stars. Let's break down these requirements to determine which of the listed stars can be detected by both.\n\n### 1. Visibility from both Observatories\n\nA star's visibility from a specific location on Earth depends on its declination (DEC) and the latitude of the observatory.\n\n*   **Paranal Observatory:** Located in the Southern Hemisphere, at a latitude of approximately -24.6 degrees. From here, all stars in the southern celestial hemisphere (DEC < 0°) and stars in the northern celestial hemisphere up to a declination of roughly +65° (90° - 24.6°) are visible at some point during the year. Therefore, stars with **DEC < +65°** are visible from Paranal.\n\n*   **W. M. Keck Observatory:** Located in the Northern Hemisphere, on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, at a latitude of approximately +19.8 degrees. From here, all stars in the northern celestial hemisphere (DEC > 0°) and stars in the southern celestial hemisphere down to a declination of roughly -70° (-(90° - 19.8°)) are visible. Therefore, stars with **DEC > -70°** are visible from Keck.\n\nFor a star to be observable from **both** observatories, its declination must be within the range visible to both: **-70° < DEC < +65°**.\n\n### 2. Apparent Magnitude Limit\n\nEach spectrograph has a limit on how faint a star it can observe, measured by the apparent V magnitude.\n\n*   **ESPRESSO:** Can observe stars with an apparent magnitude V < 17.\n*   **HIRES:** Can observe stars with an apparent magnitude V < 16.\n\nTo be observable by **both**, a star must satisfy the stricter limit. Therefore, the star's apparent V magnitude must be **V < 16**.\n\n### Analyzing Each Star\n\nNow, let's evaluate each star based on these two criteria. We'll use the distance modulus formula to calculate the apparent magnitude (m_V) when the absolute magnitude (M_V) is given:\n\n*   m_V = M_V - 5 + 5 * log10(d) + A_V\n    *   where `d` is the distance in parsecs (pc) and `A_V` is the interstellar absorption.\n    *   `A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`\n\n**Star1**\n*   **Declination:** -75°\n*   **Analysis:** The declination of -75° is south of the -70° limit for the Keck Observatory.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Not visible** from Keck.\n\n**Star2**\n*   **Declination:** +55°\n*   **Apparent V magnitude:** 16.5 mag\n*   **Analysis:** The declination is within the range (-70° to +65°). However, the apparent magnitude of 16.5 is fainter than the HIRES limit of V < 16.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Too faint** for HIRES.\n\n**Star3**\n*   **Coordinates:** RA = 11 h, DEC = 48°. (11h * 15°/h = 165°)\n*   **Visibility:** The declination of +48° is within the range (-70° to +65°). **Visible from both.**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude:** We are given the apparent magnitude `V = 15.5 mag`. We need to check if this is the observed apparent magnitude or the one before extinction. The question gives `E(B-V)`, which causes extinction. Usually, a listed apparent magnitude is the observed one *after* extinction. Let's assume V=15.5 is the observed magnitude. This value is brighter than 16.\n*   **Conclusion:** Visible from both observatories and bright enough for both spectrographs. **Observable by both.**\n\n**Star4**\n*   **Coordinates:** RA = 85°, DEC = -48°\n*   **Visibility:** The declination of -48° is within the range (-70° to +65°). **Visible from both.**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude:**\n    *   Absolute Magnitude (M_V) = 15.5 mag\n    *   Distance (d) = 10 pc\n    *   Extinction (A_V) = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag\n    *   m_V = 15.5 - 5 + 5 * log10(10) + 1.24 = 15.5 - 5 + 5 + 1.24 = **16.74 mag**\n*   **Analysis:** The calculated apparent magnitude of 16.74 is fainter than the HIRES limit of V < 16.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Too faint** for HIRES.\n\n**Star5**\n*   **Coordinates:** RA = 10 h, DEC = 60°. (10h * 15°/h = 150°)\n*   **Visibility:** The declination of +60° is within the range (-70° to +65°). **Visible from both.**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude:**\n    *   Absolute Magnitude (M_V) = 16.5 mag\n    *   Distance (d) = 5 pc\n    *   Extinction (A_V) = 0 (not given)\n    *   m_V = 16.5 - 5 + 5 * log10(5) ≈ 16.5 - 5 + 5 * (0.699) ≈ 16.5 - 5 + 3.495 = **14.995 mag**\n*   **Analysis:** The calculated apparent magnitude of ~15.0 is brighter than the HIRES limit of V < 16.\n*   **Conclusion:** Visible from both observatories and bright enough for both spectrographs. **Observable by both.**\n\nBased on the analysis, only **Star3** and **Star5** meet all the criteria for detection by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.\n\n<<<D>>>"
