    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 (L1) to the luminosity of Star_2 (L2), which is `L1 / L2`.\n\n2.  **Recall the Relevant Physics Principle:** The luminosity of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:\n    `L = σ * A * T⁴`\n    where:\n    *   `L` is the luminosity.\n    *   `σ` is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `A` is the surface area of the star.\n    *   `T` is the effective surface temperature of the star.\n\n3.  **Set up the Luminosity Ratio:**\n    For a spherical star, the surface area `A` is `4 * π * R²`, where `R` is the radius.\n    The formula becomes `L = 4 * π * σ * R² * T⁴`.\n    Now, let's write the ratio for our two stars:\n    `L1 / L2 = (4 * π * σ * R1² * T1⁴) / (4 * π * σ * R2² * T2⁴)`\n    The constants `4`, `π`, and `σ` cancel out, leaving:\n    `L1 / L2 = (R1 / R2)² * (T1 / T2)⁴`\n\n4.  **Use the Given Information for the Radius Ratio:**\n    The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2: `R1 = 1.5 * R2`.\n    Therefore, the radius ratio `R1 / R2` is 1.5.\n    Our equation now is:\n    `L1 / L2 = (1.5)² * (T1 / T2)⁴ = 2.25 * (T1 / T2)⁴`\n\n5.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio (T1 / T2):**\n    a.  **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates a star's surface temperature (`T`) to the peak wavelength (`λ_max`) at which it emits most of its light. The law states `λ_max = b / T`, where `b` is Wien's constant. This implies that temperature is inversely proportional to the *intrinsic* peak wavelength (the wavelength as measured in the star's own rest frame): `T ∝ 1 / λ_max_rest`.\n    b.  **Doppler Effect:** The problem provides the radial velocities of the stars (`v1 = 0` km/s, `v2 = 700` km/s). A non-zero radial velocity will cause a Doppler shift in the observed wavelength of light. The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same (\"the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest...are the same\"). Let's call this `λ_obs_peak`.\n    c.  **Connecting Doppler Shift and Wien's Law:** We must relate the observed peak wavelength (`λ_obs_peak`) to the intrinsic rest wavelength (`λ_max_rest`) using the Doppler formula for light: `λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v_r/c)`, where `v_r` is the radial velocity and `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   For Star_1: `v1 = 0`, so `λ_obs_peak_1 = λ_max_rest_1 * (1 + 0/c) = λ_max_rest_1`.\n    *   For Star_2: `v2 = 700 km/s`. By convention, a positive radial velocity indicates the object is moving away (recession), causing a redshift.\n        `λ_obs_peak_2 = λ_max_rest_2 * (1 + v2/c)`.\n    d.  **Solving for Temperatures:** Since the observed peak wavelengths are equal (`λ_obs_peak_1 = λ_obs_peak_2`):\n        `λ_max_rest_1 = λ_max_rest_2 * (1 + v2/c)`\n        Now, from Wien's law, `T = b / λ_max_rest`, so `λ_max_rest = b / T`. Substituting this into the equation:\n        `b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c)`\n        Dividing both sides by `b` gives:\n        `1 / T1 = (1 / T2) * (1 + v2/c)`\n        Rearranging to find the temperature ratio `T1 / T2`:\n        `T1 / T2 = 1 / (1 + v2/c)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Luminosity Ratio:**\n    Substitute the expression for the temperature ratio back into our luminosity ratio formula:\n    `L1 / L2 = (1.5)² * [1 / (1 + v2/c)]⁴`\n    `L1 / L2 = 2.25 / (1 + v2/c)⁴`\n    Now, we plug in the numerical values:\n    *   `v2 = 700 km/s = 700,000 m/s`\n    *   `c` (speed of light) `≈ 299,792,458 m/s`\n    *   The calculation is `2.25 / (1 + 700,000 / 299,792,458)⁴`.\n\nLet's compute the value using a script.\n```python\n# Given values\nR1_over_R2 = 1.5\nv2 = 700 * 1000  # m/s\nc = 299792458  # m/s, speed of light\n\n# Calculate the luminosity ratio\n# The formula is L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 / (1 + v2/c)^4\nluminosity_ratio = (R1_over_R2)**2 / (1 + v2/c)**4\n\nprint(luminosity_ratio)\n```\n```output\n2.2290700147690324\n```\nThe calculated value is approximately `2.229`. Rounding this value gives `2.23`. This matches option A.\n\nThe mass information (`M1 = 1.5 * M2`) is extraneous and not needed for this calculation, which is based on the principles of black-body radiation.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The reasoning is as follows:\n\n1.  **Luminosity and Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (`L`) of a star radiating as a black body is determined by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: `L = σ * A * T⁴`, where `σ` is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, `A` is the star's surface area, and `T` is its effective surface temperature.\n2.  **Surface Area:** For a spherical star, the surface area is `A = 4 * π * R²`, where `R` is the radius. So, the luminosity equation becomes `L = 4 * π * σ * R² * T⁴`.\n3.  **Luminosity Ratio:** We want to find the ratio `L1 / L2`.\n    `L1 / L2 = (4 * π * σ * R1² * T1⁴) / (4 * π * σ * R2² * T2⁴)`\n    The constants `4`, `π`, and `σ` cancel out, simplifying the expression to:\n    `L1 / L2 = (R1 / R2)² * (T1 / T2)⁴`\n4.  **Radius Ratio:** The problem states that `R1 = 1.5 * R2`, so the ratio `R1 / R2 = 1.5`. Substituting this in gives:\n    `L1 / L2 = (1.5)² * (T1 / T2)⁴ = 2.25 * (T1 / T2)⁴`\n5.  **Temperature Ratio from Wien's Law and Doppler Effect:**\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law** relates the temperature (`T`) of a black body to the peak wavelength (`λ_rest_max`) at which it radiates in its own rest frame: `T ∝ 1 / λ_rest_max`. Therefore, the temperature ratio `T1 / T2` is equal to `λ_rest_max_2 / λ_rest_max_1`.\n    *   The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same for both stars (`λ_obs1 = λ_obs2`). We must account for the Doppler effect due to their radial velocities (`v`).\n    *   The relationship between the observed wavelength (`λ_obs`) and the rest wavelength (`λ_rest`) is given by the Doppler formula: `λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c)`, where `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   For Star 1: `v1 = 0`. So, `λ_obs1 = λ_rest_max_1 * (1 + 0/c) = λ_rest_max_1`.\n    *   For Star 2: `v2 = 700` km/s. A positive velocity typically means recession, causing a redshift. `λ_obs2 = λ_rest_max_2 * (1 + v2/c)`.\n    *   Since `λ_obs1 = λ_obs2`, we have `λ_rest_max_1 = λ_rest_max_2 * (1 + v2/c)`.\n    *   Rearranging to find the ratio we need for temperature: `λ_rest_max_2 / λ_rest_max_1 = 1 / (1 + v2/c)`.\n    *   Therefore, `T1 / T2 = 1 / (1 + v2/c)`.\n6.  **Final Calculation:** Substitute the temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    `L1 / L2 = 2.25 * (1 / (1 + v2/c))⁴ = 2.25 / (1 + v2/c)⁴`\n    Using the values `v2 = 700 km/s = 700,000 m/s` and `c = 299,792,458 m/s`, the code calculates this expression.\n\nThe executed code provides the result `2.22907...`. Rounding this value gives `2.23`. This corresponds to option A. The information about the masses of the stars is irrelevant to this specific problem concerning luminosity based on black-body radiation principles.\n\n<<<A>>>"
