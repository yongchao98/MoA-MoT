    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity Amplitude (K)**\n\n    The radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by observing the Doppler shift of the host star's spectral lines. The observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta \\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$) along our line of sight.\n\n    The maximum observed wavelength shift, $\\Delta \\lambda_{max}$, corresponds to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as $K$. Therefore:\n    $K \\propto \\Delta \\lambda_{max}$\n\n    We can write this as a ratio for the two systems:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_{max, 2}}{\\Delta \\lambda_{max, 1}}$\n\n    Given the values:\n    *   $\\Delta \\lambda_{max, 1} = 5$ miliangstroms\n    *   $\\Delta \\lambda_{max, 2} = 7$ miliangstroms\n\n    The ratio of the RV amplitudes is:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4$\n\n2.  **Derive the Relationship Between K and Orbital Period (P)**\n\n    We need to relate the RV amplitude $K$ to the physical parameters of the star-planet system. For a circular orbit, and assuming the system is viewed edge-on for simplicity (the inclination angle cancels out in the ratio anyway if we assume it's the same for both systems), the RV amplitude $K$ is the orbital speed of the star, $v_{star}$.\n\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** The star and planet orbit a common center of mass.\n        $M_{star} v_{star} = M_p v_p$\n        where $M$ and $v$ are the mass and orbital velocity, and the subscripts 'star' and 'p' denote the star and planet, respectively.\n        So, $K = v_{star} = \\frac{M_p}{M_{star}} v_p$\n\n    *   **Planet's Orbital Velocity:** The planet's orbital velocity ($v_p$) is related to its orbital radius ($a$) and period ($P$).\n        $v_p = \\frac{2\\pi a}{P}$\n\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law:** This law relates the orbital radius and period. For a planet orbiting a much more massive star ($M_{star} \\gg M_p$):\n        $P^2 \\propto a^3$\n        This means we can express the radius in terms of the period:\n        $a \\propto P^{2/3}$\n\n    *   **Combine the equations:** Now substitute the relation for $a$ into the equation for $v_p$:\n        $v_p \\propto \\frac{a}{P} \\propto \\frac{P^{2/3}}{P} = P^{-1/3}$\n\n    *   Finally, substitute this into the equation for $K$:\n        $K = \\frac{M_p}{M_{star}} v_p \\propto \\frac{M_p}{M_{star}} P^{-1/3}$\n\n3.  **Solve for the Ratio of Periods**\n\n    The problem states that the star masses are the same ($M_{star1} = M_{star2}$) and the planet masses are the same ($M_{p1} = M_{p2}$). Therefore, the mass term $\\frac{M_p}{M_{star}}$ is constant for both systems.\n\n    The relationship simplifies to:\n    $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\n    We can write this as a ratio:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\left( \\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\right)^{-1/3}$\n\n    We need to find the ratio of the periods, $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$. Let's rearrange the equation:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left( \\frac{K_2}{K_1} \\right)^{-3}$\n\n    Substitute the value for the ratio of K we found in step 1:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = (1.4)^{-3} = \\left( \\frac{7}{5} \\right)^{-3} = \\left( \\frac{5}{7} \\right)^{3}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Value**\n\n    Let's compute the value using a Python script.\n```python\n# The question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to planet #1, which is P2/P1.\n# The ratio of the RV amplitudes is K2/K1 = 7/5.\n# The relationship is (K2/K1) = (P2/P1)^(-1/3).\n# We solve for P2/P1.\n\nratio_K = 7 / 5\nratio_P = ratio_K**(-3)\n\nprint(f\"{ratio_P:.2f}\")\n```\n>>>\n0.36\n<<<\n\nThe calculation shows that the ratio of the period of planet #2 to planet #1 is approximately 0.36.\n\nThis means the period of planet #2 is shorter than that of planet #1.

    "The thinking process to arrive at the solution is as follows:\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Physics:** The problem uses the Radial Velocity (RV) method. This method works by detecting the Doppler shift in a star's light caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The star \"wobbles\" back and forth, causing its spectral lines to shift periodically towards blue (when moving towards us) and red (when moving away). The magnitude of this shift tells us about the star's speed.\n\n2.  **Relate Observational Data to Physical Quantities:**\n    *   The observable is the \"periodic shift of a spectral line,\" given in miliangstroms ($\\text{m}\\unicode{x212B}$). This is a measure of the wavelength shift, $\\Delta\\lambda$.\n    *   The *amplitude* of this periodic shift, $\\Delta\\lambda_{\\text{max}}$, is directly proportional to the *amplitude* of the star's radial velocity, which is denoted by $K$.\n    *   Therefore, we can establish a ratio:\n        $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{\\text{max, 2}}}{\\Delta\\lambda_{\\text{max, 1}}}$\n    *   Using the given values:\n        $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{7 \\text{ miliangstroms}}{5 \\text{ miliangstroms}} = 1.4$\n\n3.  **Find the Mathematical Relationship Between Radial Velocity Amplitude ($K$) and Orbital Period ($P$):**\n    *   For a star-planet system in a circular orbit, the star's velocity amplitude ($K$) can be expressed using fundamental laws. We assume we are viewing the system edge-on for simplicity (the inclination term, $\\sin i$, would cancel out in the ratio anyway if we assume it's the same for both systems, which is a reasonable assumption in the absence of other information).\n    *   From conservation of momentum, the star's orbital speed ($v_{\\text{star}}$, which is our $K$) and the planet's orbital speed ($v_p$) are related by their masses ($M_{\\text{star}}$, $M_p$):\n        $M_{\\text{star}} v_{\\text{star}} = M_p v_p \\implies K = v_{\\text{star}} = \\frac{M_p}{M_{\\text{star}}} v_p$\n    *   The planet's orbital speed is the circumference of its orbit divided by the period:\n        $v_p = \\frac{2\\pi a}{P}$ (where 'a' is the orbital radius/semi-major axis).\n    *   Substituting this into the equation for K:\n        $K = \\frac{M_p}{M_{\\text{star}}} \\frac{2\\pi a}{P}$\n    *   We need to eliminate 'a' and express everything in terms of the period 'P'. For this, we use Kepler's Third Law. In its Newtonian form, for a low-mass planet ($M_p \\ll M_{\\text{star}}$), it is:\n        $P^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G M_{\\text{star}}} a^3$\n    *   We solve this for 'a':\n        $a^3 = \\frac{G M_{\\text{star}} P^2}{4\\pi^2} \\implies a = \\left( \\frac{G M_{\\text{star}}}{4\\pi^2} \\right)^{1/3} P^{2/3}$\n    *   Now we substitute this expression for 'a' back into our equation for K:\n        $K = \\frac{M_p}{M_{\\text{star}}} \\frac{2\\pi}{P} \\left[ \\left( \\frac{G M_{\\text{star}}}{4\\pi^2} \\right)^{1/3} P^{2/3} \\right]$\n    *   Let's group the terms to see the proportionality. All terms like $G$, $\\pi$, $M_p$, and $M_{\\text{star}}$ are either constants or are stated to be the same for both systems.\n        $K \\propto \\frac{1}{P} \\cdot P^{2/3} = P^{2/3 - 1} = P^{-1/3}$\n    *   So, we find the crucial relationship: $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$. This means that a larger RV amplitude ($K$) corresponds to a shorter orbital period ($P$).\n\n4.  **Solve for the Ratio of Periods:**\n    *   Using the proportionality from the previous step, we can set up another ratio:\n        $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{-1/3}$\n    *   We want to find the ratio of the periods, $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$. We need to isolate this term by raising both sides of the equation to the power of -3:\n        $\\left(\\frac{K_2}{K_1}\\right)^{-3} = \\left(\\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{-1/3}\\right)^{-3}$\n        $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_2}{K_1}\\right)^{-3}$\n    *   Now, we substitute the value of the K ratio we found in step 2:\n        $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = (1.4)^{-3}$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   The final step is to compute $(1.4)^{-3}$. This can be done with a simple calculation. It's equivalent to $1 / (1.4^3)$ or $(5/7)^3$.\n    *   Let's use the provided python script to compute this precisely. The script correctly calculates $(7/5)^{-3}$.\n\n```python\n# The question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to planet #1, which is P2/P1.\n# The ratio of the RV amplitudes is K2/K1 = 7/5.\n# The relationship is (K2/K1) = (P2/P1)^(-1/3).\n# We solve for P2/P1.\n\nratio_K = 7 / 5\nratio_P = ratio_K**(-3)\n\nprint(f\"{ratio_P:.2f}\")\n```\nThe output `0.36` from the code represents the ratio $P_2 / P_1$. Comparing this result to the multiple-choice options:\n\nA) ~ 1.96\nB) ~ 0.36\nC) ~ 1.40\nD) ~ 0.85\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The reasoning is as follows:\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity Amplitude (K):** The observed maximum wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity amplitude ($K$).\n    *   For Planet 1 system: $K_1 \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5 \\text{ miliangstroms}$\n    *   For Planet 2 system: $K_2 \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7 \\text{ miliangstroms}$\n    *   The ratio of the amplitudes is: $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4$\n\n2.  **Relate Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P):** For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity amplitude $K$ is related to the star's mass ($M_{star}$), the planet's mass ($M_p$), and the orbital period ($P$) by the following proportionality (derived from Newton's laws of motion and gravitation):\n    $K \\propto \\frac{M_p}{M_{star}^{2/3} P^{1/3}}$\n\n3.  **Apply the Given Conditions:** The problem states that the stars have the same mass ($M_{star1} = M_{star2}$) and the planets have the same mass ($M_{p1} = M_{p2}$). Therefore, the terms $M_p$ and $M_{star}$ are constants in the comparison, and the proportionality simplifies to:\n    $K \\propto \\frac{1}{P^{1/3}}$ or $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n    This means that a larger RV amplitude corresponds to a shorter orbital period.\n\n4.  **Solve for the Ratio of Periods:** We can write the proportionality as a ratio:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{-1/3}$\n    We need to find the ratio $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$.
