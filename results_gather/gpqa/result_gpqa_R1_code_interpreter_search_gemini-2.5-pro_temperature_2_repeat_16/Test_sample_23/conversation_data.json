    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the chemistry problem.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon with the formula C_n H_m.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. Let's express this as a fraction: 14.28% ≈ 14.28/100 ≈ 1/7.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula: `Mass_fraction(H) = (m * M_H) / (n * M_C + m * M_H)`, where M_H and M_C are the atomic masses of hydrogen and carbon, respectively.\n*   Using approximate integer masses (C=12, H=1), which is common in such problems, we get: `1/7 = (m * 1) / (n * 12 + m * 1)`\n*   This simplifies to `12n + m = 7m`, which gives `12n = 6m`, or `m = 2n`.\n*   A hydrocarbon with the formula C_n H_{2n} can be either an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n*   The problem states that Z is formed by hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n*   The problem also states that Z is widely used as a solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent with a six-membered ring structure (which we will see is required later) is cyclohexane.\n*   Let's check for cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂. Here, n=6 and m=12, so m=2n. This fits our derived formula. Let's confirm the mass fraction with C=12 and H=1: `Mass_fraction(H) = 12 / (6*12 + 12) = 12 / (72 + 12) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%`.\n*   Thus, hydrocarbon Z is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Carbon Skeleton of the Compounds**\n\n*   The problem states that hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y gives *only one substance*, which is Z (cyclohexane).\n*   Hydrogenation is a reaction that adds hydrogen across double/triple bonds or opens certain rings, but it typically does not rearrange the carbon skeleton under these conditions.\n*   Since the only final product is cyclohexane (a C₆ ring), all the compounds in both mixture X and mixture Y must have a six-carbon ring skeleton.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is formed from mixture X by heating with platinum. It's an equimolar mixture of two liquids and does not decolorize bromine water.\n*   This indicates that the components of Y are saturated or aromatic.\n*   One of the components of Y is Z, which is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). Cyclohexane is saturated and does not decolorize bromine water.\n*   The reaction to form Y is described as a disproportionation. In catalytic reactions involving unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbons and platinum, this often means hydrogen transfer. An intermediate unsaturated compound is converted into a fully saturated one (reduction) and a fully unsaturated (aromatic) one (oxidation).\n*   Since cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) is the reduced product, the other component must be the oxidized product. The ultimate oxidation product of a C₆ ring is **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n*   Benzene does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions (it requires a Lewis acid catalyst).\n*   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **benzene (C₆H₆)** and **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n*   Let's check if hydrogenating mixture Y gives only Z.\n    *   Hydrogenation of benzene: C₆H₆ + 3H₂ → C₆H₁₂ (cyclohexane)\n    *   Hydrogenation of cyclohexane: No reaction.\n*   So, hydrogenation of mixture Y correctly yields only cyclohexane (Z).\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Components of Mixture X and Solve the Question**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them X₁ and X₂.\n*   X decolorizes bromine water, meaning X₁ and X₂ are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n*   Molecules in X have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   When mixture X is treated, it yields an equimolar mixture Y. This suggests a 1:1 stoichiometric reaction between the components of X to form the components of Y.\n    *   X₁ + X₂ → Y₁ + Y₂\n    *   X₁ + X₂ → Benzene (C₆H₆) + Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)\n*   Since all molecules have a C₆ skeleton, we only need to balance the hydrogen atoms. The total number of hydrogen atoms must be conserved.\n    *   Total H atoms on the left = Total H atoms on the right\n    *   H atoms in X₁ + H atoms in X₂ = H atoms in benzene + H atoms in cyclohexane\n    *   H atoms in X₁ + H atoms in X₂ = 6 + 12 = 18.\n*   We need to find two unsaturated, non-conjugated C₆-ring compounds whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18.\n*   The possible candidates are:\n    *   **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)**: It has one C=C bond and is not conjugated.\n    *   **Cyclohexadienes (C₆H₈)**: There are two isomers: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated). The problem rules out the conjugated one.\n*   So our candidates for X₁ and X₂ are **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n*   Let's check if their hydrogen atoms sum to 18:\n    *   10 (from cyclohexene) + 8 (from 1,4-cyclohexadiene) = 18.\n*   This fits perfectly. The reaction is a catalytic hydrogen transfer: 1,4-cyclohexadiene loses two hydrogens to become benzene, and cyclohexene gains those two hydrogens to become cyclohexane.\n    *   C₆H₈ (1,4-cyclohexadiene) + C₆H₁₀ (cyclohexene) → C₆H₆ (benzene) + C₆H₁₂ (cyclohexane)\n*   The question asks for \"the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X\". This means the sum of the hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n*   Total hydrogen atoms = (H in X₁) + (H in X₂) = 8 + 10 = 18.\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
