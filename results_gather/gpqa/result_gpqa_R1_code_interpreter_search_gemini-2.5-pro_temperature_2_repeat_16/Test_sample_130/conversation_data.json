    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Dicarboxylic Acid/Anhydride:** A dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated to an anhydride. The NMR data for this anhydride is given:\n    *   ¹H NMR: a single peak at 7 ppm.\n    *   ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n    *   The symmetry suggested by a single ¹H peak for alkene protons points to a symmetrical molecule. The chemical shifts are characteristic of maleic anhydride. Maleic acid is the *cis*-dicarboxylic acid, and its dehydration product is maleic anhydride.\n    *   In maleic anhydride, the two alkene protons are equivalent due to a plane of symmetry, giving one singlet in the ¹H NMR spectrum. Their chemical shift around 7 ppm is expected due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the two adjacent carbonyl groups.\n    *   The two alkene carbons are equivalent (around 137 ppm), and the two carbonyl carbons are equivalent (around 165 ppm). This matches the ¹³C NMR data.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The anhydride is **maleic anhydride**.\n\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   This is a five-membered ring with conjugated double bonds at positions 1 and 3. There are four methyl groups on carbons C1, C2, C3, and C4. The remaining carbon, C5, is a methylene group (CH₂).\n\n**2. The Reaction: Diels-Alder Cycloaddition**\n\n*   The reaction is a [4+2] Diels-Alder cycloaddition between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n*   The reaction forms a bridged bicyclic product. The resulting skeleton is based on bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** This reaction can form two diastereomeric products: the *endo* adduct and the *exo* adduct.\n    *   According to the Alder-endo rule, the *endo* product is formed faster and is usually the major product under kinetic control (lower temperatures, shorter reaction times). The *exo* product is more thermodynamically stable and would be the major product under thermodynamic control (higher temperatures, longer reaction times). The problem statement implies a kinetic mixture by mentioning \"a major and a minor product,\" so it's safe to assume:\n        *   **Major product = Endo adduct**\n        *   **Minor product = Exo adduct**\n*   **Product Structure:** The molecular formula C₁₃H₁₆O₃ matches the sum of the reactants (Diene C₉H₁₄ + Anhydride C₄H₂O₃). The product is 1,4,5,6-tetramethylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride. Both isomers have a plane of symmetry.\n\n**3. Analyze the Product Structure and Predict ¹H NMR Signals**\n\nDue to the plane of symmetry in both isomers, we expect the following signals:\n*   **Two vinylic methyl groups (at C5, C6):** Equivalent, giving a **6H singlet**. These are on sp² carbons, so they will be somewhat deshielded (~1.7 ppm).\n*   **Two bridgehead methyl groups (at C1, C4):** Equivalent, giving a **6H singlet**. These are on sp³ carbons, so they will be more shielded (~1.0 ppm).\n*   **Two anhydride methine protons (at C2, C3):** Equivalent, giving a **2H singlet**. They are alpha to carbonyl groups and will be significantly deshielded (~3.5 ppm).\n*   **Two bridge methylene protons (at C7):** These are diastereotopic (one *syn* to the double bond, one *anti*). They will appear as two separate signals, each integrating to 1H, and they will be coupled to each other (geminal coupling), likely forming an AB quartet (appearing as two doublets). A chemical shift of ~1.5 ppm for one of them is reasonable.\n\n**4. Interpret the NOESY Spectrum**\n\n*   NOESY shows correlations between protons that are close in space (< 5Å).\n*   The key information is: **A cross-peak is present in the spectrum of the major product but absent (or very weak) in the spectrum of the minor product.**\n*   We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer (major product) but far apart in the *exo* isomer (minor product).\n\n*   **Endo Isomer (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the bicyclic system, on the same side as the C7 bridge.\n    *   In this conformation, the anhydride methine protons (at C2, C3, signal at ~3.5 ppm) are spatially close to the C7-bridge proton that is *anti* to the double bond. A strong NOE is expected between these protons.\n\n*   **Exo Isomer (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is pointing \"away\" from the C7 bridge.\n    *   In this conformation, the anhydride methine protons (~3.5 ppm) are far from both C7-bridge protons. Therefore, the corresponding NOE cross-peak would be absent or very weak.\n\n*   This analysis directly matches the experimental observation. The distinguishing cross-peak connects the anhydride protons with one of the C7-bridge protons.\n\n**5. Match the Analysis to the Options**\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on our analysis:\n*   The resonances involved are:\n    1.  The anhydride methine protons: a **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n    2.  One of the C7-bridge protons: a **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\n*   Now check the options:\n    A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm: (Bridgehead Me <-> Vinylic Me). These are far apart.\n    B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: (Vinylic Me <-> Anhydride H). This interaction is strong in the *exo* (minor) product, not the *endo* (major) one. This contradicts the data.\n    C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm: (Bridgehead Me <-> Bridge H). This interaction is likely present in both isomers and is not the unique distinguishing feature.\n    D) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: (Bridge H <-> Anhydride H). This perfectly matches our finding. This NOE is strong in the major (*endo*) product and absent in the minor (*exo*) product.\n\n<<<D>>>"
