    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the suitable reagents A and B for the given reactions.\n\n### **Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction starts with a ketone (butan-2-one) and a cyanide source (NaCN) and yields a cyanohydrin (2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile). This is a classic **cyanohydrin formation** reaction.\n\n2.  **Analyze the mechanism:**\n    *   Sodium cyanide (NaCN) dissociates in the solvent to provide the nucleophilic cyanide ion (⁻CN).\n    *   The cyanide ion attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This is a nucleophilic addition reaction.\n        `CH₃CH₂-CO-CH₃ + ⁻CN → CH₃CH₂-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₃` (This creates an alkoxide intermediate).\n    *   The negatively charged oxygen of the alkoxide intermediate needs to be protonated to form the final hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n        `CH₃CH₂-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₃ + H⁺ → CH₃CH₂-C(OH)(CN)-CH₃`\n    *   Therefore, reagent **A** must be a source of protons (H⁺).\n\n3.  **Evaluate the options for A:**\n    *   **H₃O⁺:** This represents a strong acid in an aqueous solution (like HCl or H₂SO₄). It is a direct source of protons and is commonly used to protonate the alkoxide intermediate. While mixing NaCN and a strong acid directly can be hazardous due to the release of toxic HCN gas, the acid is often added slowly to the reaction mixture, or the H₃O⁺ simply denotes the proton source required to complete the reaction. It is a chemically correct choice for providing the necessary proton.\n    *   **NaHSO₃ (sodium bisulfite):** This reagent typically adds to aldehydes and some ketones to form crystalline bisulfite adducts. It is used for purification, not as a proton source for cyanohydrin formation. It would compete with the cyanide ion. Thus, it is not the correct reagent for A.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for A:** Reagent A must be H₃O⁺.\n\n### **Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) in the presence of water and reagent B. This is a **nitrile hydrolysis** reaction. The complex substituent \"2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxy...\" is just the 'R' group of the nitrile and does not participate in the core reaction.\n\n2.  **Analyze the mechanism:**\n    *   Nitrile hydrolysis requires a catalyst, which can be either an acid (H⁺) or a base (OH⁻), and usually requires heat. The overall reaction is:\n        `R-CN + 2 H₂O --(catalyst)--> R-COOH + NH₃` (or its protonated/deprotonated form depending on the pH).\n    *   Reagent **B** is the catalyst for this hydrolysis.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the options for B:**\n    *   **HCl (Hydrochloric acid):** This is a strong acid. Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of nitriles is a standard and effective method. The strong acid protonates the nitrile nitrogen, making the carbon more susceptible to nucleophilic attack by water. It is a very common reagent for this transformation.\n    *   **CH₃COOH (Acetic acid):** This is a weak acid. While technically an acid catalyst, it is much less effective than a strong mineral acid like HCl. Nitrile hydrolysis is often a sluggish reaction, and a weak acid like acetic acid would likely result in very low yield or require extremely harsh conditions (very high temperature and pressure). Therefore, HCl is the much more suitable reagent.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for B:** Reagent B is HCl.\n\n### **Final Selection**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Reagent A is H₃O⁺.\n*   Reagent B is HCl.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
