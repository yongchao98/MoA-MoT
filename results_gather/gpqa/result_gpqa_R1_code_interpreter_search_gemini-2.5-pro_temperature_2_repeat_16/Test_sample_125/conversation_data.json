    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I and its products.**\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral ketone with one stereocenter at the C5 position, in the (S) configuration. The structure is CH3CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(S)(CH3)-OCH3.\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H3O+).\n*   **Reaction:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol. This reaction creates a new stereocenter at the C3 position. The stereocenter at C5 is not involved in the reaction and its configuration remains (S).\n*   **Products:** The hydride ion can attack the planar carbonyl group from two different faces, creating two possible configurations at C3: (R) or (S). This leads to the formation of two products:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:** The two products have the same configuration at C5 but different configurations at C3. Stereoisomers that differ at some, but not all, stereocenters are called **diastereomers**. Because the starting material is chiral, the two diastereomers will be formed in unequal amounts.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II and its products.**\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone). This molecule, CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3, is achiral.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4) followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction:** NaBH4 is a reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols. The term \"excess\" indicates that both ketone groups will be reduced, forming pentane-2,4-diol. The reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol, CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. We need to determine the stereoisomers formed. There are two stereocenters, so there are a maximum of 2^2 = 4 stereoisomers. Let's analyze them:\n    1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n    2.  **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n    3.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n    4.  **(2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:**\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images. They are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, this pair will be produced as a racemic mixture (a 50:50 mix).\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C3. The (2R, 4S) isomer is superimposable on its mirror image ((2S, 4R)). This type of achiral stereoisomer is called a **meso compound**. Thus, (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) represent the same single meso compound.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomeric products are formed: a pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) and a meso compound.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the combined mixture with normal-phase HPLC.**\n*   The final mixture contains five different compounds: the two diastereomers from Reaction I and the three stereoisomers from Reaction II.\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity. It uses an achiral stationary phase.\n*   **Key principles of achiral chromatography:**\n    *   It **separates** constitutional isomers (different connectivity).\n    *   It **separates** diastereomers (they have different physical properties, including polarity).\n    *   It **does not separate** enantiomers (they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment).\n*   **Applying these principles to the mixture:**\n    1.  The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers. They will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    2.  The three products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers, so it will be separated from them. The two enantiomers will not separate from each other and will elute as a single peak. This gives **2 peaks** (one for the meso compound, one for the racemic pair).\n    3.  The products from Reaction I (C7 methoxy-alcohols) are constitutional isomers of the products from Reaction II (C5 diols). They have significantly different structures and polarities and will not co-elute.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** The 2 peaks from Reaction I products and the 2 peaks from Reaction II products are all distinct. Therefore, we observe a total of 2 + 2 = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the combined mixture with chiral HPLC.**\n*   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase (CSP), which creates a chiral environment.\n*   **Key principles of chiral chromatography:**\n    *   It separates all compounds that are separable on a normal-phase column (constitutional isomers, diastereomers).\n    *   Crucially, it **also separates enantiomers**. The enantiomers interact differently with the CSP, forming transient diastereomeric complexes with different stabilities, leading to different retention times.\n*   **Applying this principle to the mixture:**\n    *   The mixture contains five chemically distinct compounds:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Since a chiral column can resolve all types of stereoisomers (including enantiomers) from each other, all five unique compounds in the mixture will be separated.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** We expect to observe **5 peaks**.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion.**\n*   Normal-phase HPLC: 4 peaks\n*   Chiral HPLC: 5 peaks\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nB) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC\nC) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nD) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
