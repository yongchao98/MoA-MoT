    "Here's my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Goal:** The primary goal is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, which can be written as `T_eq(P4) / T_eq(P2)`.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Physics Principles:**\n    *   **Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq):** The equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on the star's properties and the planet's distance from the star. The formula is:\n        `T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a)) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`\n        Where `T_star` is the star's temperature, `R_star` is the star's radius, `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (its distance from the star for a circular orbit), and `A` is the planet's albedo.\n\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion:** This law relates a planet's orbital period (P) to its semi-major axis (a). For two planets orbiting the same star, the relationship is:\n        `(P1/P2)² = (a1/a2)³`\n\n3.  **Formulate a Ratio and Simplify:**\n    I need to find the ratio `T_eq(P4) / T_eq(P2)`. Let's write out the full expressions:\n    `T_eq(P4) = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a4)) * (1 - A4)^(1/4)`\n    `T_eq(P2) = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2)) * (1 - A2)^(1/4)`\n\n    Now, let's divide the first equation by the second. Several terms are constant for both planets and will cancel out:\n    *   `T_star` (the star is the same).\n    *   `R_star` (the star is the same).\n    *   The constant `2`.\n    *   The albedo term `(1 - A)^(1/4)` because the problem states the planets possess the same albedo (`A4 = A2`).\n\n    After cancellation, the ratio simplifies significantly:\n    `T_eq(P4) / T_eq(P2) = sqrt(1 / a4) / sqrt(1 / a2) = sqrt(a2 / a4)`\n\n4.  **Connect Temperature Ratio to Period Ratio:**\n    So far, I have `T_eq(P4) / T_eq(P2) = sqrt(a2 / a4)`.\n    Now, I'll use Kepler's Third Law to replace the semi-major axis ratio (`a2 / a4`) with the orbital period ratio (`P2 / P4`), which is given in the problem.\n    From Kepler's Third Law: `(P4/P2)² = (a4/a2)³`\n    I need `a2 / a4`, so I'll rearrange the equation:\n    First, invert both sides: `(P2/P4)² = (a2/a4)³`\n    Then, take the cube root of both sides to solve for `a2 / a4`:\n    `a2 / a4 = ( (P2/P4)² )^(1/3) = (P2/P4)^(2/3)`\n\n    Now substitute this back into my simplified temperature ratio equation:\n    `T_eq(P4) / T_eq(P2) = sqrt( (P2/P4)^(2/3) )`\n    `T_eq(P4) / T_eq(P2) = ( (P2/P4)^(2/3) )^(1/2)`\n    The exponents multiply `(2/3) * (1/2) = 1/3`.\n    `T_eq(P4) / T_eq(P2) = (P2 / P4)^(1/3)`\n\n5.  **Use the Given Data:**\n    The problem provides the ratio of orbital periods: `P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5`.\n    From this, I can find the ratio `P2 / P4`:\n    `P2 / P4 = 2 / 3.5`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    Now I have all the pieces. I just need to compute the value.\n    `T_eq(P4) / T_eq(P2) = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)`\n    To perform this calculation accurately, I'll use a short Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The ratio of the orbital periods for Planet 2 and Planet 4\nP2 = 2.0\nP4 = 3.5\n\n# As derived in the reasoning, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is related\n# to the inverse cube root of the period ratio.\n# T_eq(P4) / T_eq(P2) = (P2 / P4)^(1/3)\ntemperature_ratio = (P2 / P4)**(1/3)\n\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\n\nThe computed value is approximately 0.82998.\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   A) ~0.57\n    *   B) ~0.83\n    *   C) ~0.75\n    *   D) ~0.69\n\n    The calculated value of ~0.83 matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary goal is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet 4 and Planet 2, denoted as `T_eq(P4) / T_eq(P2)`.\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) of a planet orbiting a star is given by:\n    `T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))`\n    Where:\n    *   `T_star` is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n    *   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n    *   `a` is the planet's semi-major axis (orbital distance).\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** We can write the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for Planet 4 and Planet 2 as:\n    `T_eq(P4) / T_eq(P2) = [T_star * (1 - A_4)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_4))] / [T_star * (1 - A_2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))]`\n\n4.  **Simplify the Expression:** Since the planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, several terms cancel out:\n    *   `T_star` (same star)\n    *   `R_star` (same star)\n    *   The constant `2`.\n    *   The albedo term `(1 - A)^(1/4)` because `A_4 = A_2`.\n\n    The simplified ratio becomes:\n    `T_eq(P4) / T_eq(P2) = sqrt(1 / a_4) / sqrt(1 / a_2)`\n    `T_eq(P4) / T_eq(P2) = sqrt(a_2 / a_4)`\n\n5.  **Incorporate Kepler's Third Law:** We don't have the distances (`a`), but we have the orbital periods (`P`). Kepler's Third Law relates these two quantities for planets orbiting the same star:\n    `(P_x / P_y)^2 = (a_x / a_y)^3`\n    For Planet 2 and Planet 4, this is:\n    `(P_2 / P_4)^2 = (a_2 / a_4)^3`\n\n6.  **Solve for the Distance Ratio:** To find `(a_2 / a_4)`, we take the cube root of both sides of Kepler's equation:\n    `(a_2 / a_4) = (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3)`\n\n7.  **Substitute into the Temperature Ratio Equation:** Now we substitute this expression for the distance ratio back into our simplified temperature ratio equation:\n    `T_eq(P4) / T_eq(P2) = sqrt( (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3) )`\n    Raising a power to another power involves multiplying the exponents (`sqrt(x) = x^(1/2)`):\n    `T_eq(P4) / T_eq(P2) = (P_2 / P_4)^((2/3) * (1/2))`\n    `T_eq(P4) / T_eq(P2) = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)`\n\n8.  **Use the Given Period Ratios:** The problem states the orbital period ratio is `1:2:2.5:3.5:5` for Planets 1 through 5.\n    *   `P_2` corresponds to the value `2`.\n    *   `P_4` corresponds to the value `3.5`.\n    So, the ratio `P_2 / P_4 = 2 / 3.5`.\n\n9.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    `T_eq(P4) / T_eq(P2) = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)`\n    We can now calculate this value. The previously run Python code provides the precise result.\n\n    `ratio = (2.0 / 3.5)**(1.0/3.0)`\n    `ratio ≈ 0.8298`\n\n10. **Compare to Options:** The calculated value `~0.83` matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
