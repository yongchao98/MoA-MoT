    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Define the initial state |alpha> and normalize it\n\nThe state `|alpha>` is given as being proportional to `(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>`.\nLet the unnormalized state be `|psi> = (1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>`.\nIn matrix notation, with `|up> = [[1], [0]]` and `|down> = [[0], [1]]`, we have:\n`|psi> = [[1+i], [2-i]]`\n\nTo normalize this state, we need to find its norm, `<psi|psi>`, and divide by its square root.\nThe bra `<psi|` is the conjugate transpose of the ket `|psi>`:\n`<psi| = [[1-i, 2+i]]`\n\nThe inner product `<psi|psi>` is:\n`<psi|psi> = (1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i)`\nUsing the formula `(a+bi)(a-bi) = a^2 + b^2`:\n`<psi|psi> = (1^2 + 1^2) + (2^2 + (-1)^2) = (1+1) + (4+1) = 2 + 5 = 7`\n\nThe normalization constant is `N = 1/sqrt(<psi|psi>) = 1/sqrt(7)`.\nSo, the normalized state `|alpha>` is:\n`|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * ((1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>)`\n\n### 2. Define the operator A and find its eigenstates and eigenvalues\n\nThe operator A has matrix elements `Aij = hbar/2` if `i != j` and `0` otherwise. In the `{|up>, |down>}` basis, this gives the matrix:\n`A = [[A11, A12], [A21, A22]] = [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]`\nWe can write this as `A = (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`. Note that `[[0, 1], [1, 0]]` is the Pauli-X matrix, `sigma_x`.\n\nTo find the eigenvalues, we solve the characteristic equation `det(A - lambda*I) = 0`:\n`det([[ -lambda, hbar/2], [hbar/2, -lambda]]) = 0`\n`(-lambda)(-lambda) - (hbar/2)(hbar/2) = 0`\n`lambda^2 - (hbar/2)^2 = 0`\n`lambda^2 = (hbar/2)^2`\nSo, the eigenvalues are `lambda_1 = +hbar/2` and `lambda_2 = -hbar/2`.\n\nNow, we find the corresponding normalized eigenstates:\n*   For `lambda_1 = +hbar/2`:\n    `(A - (hbar/2)*I) |v1> = 0`\n    `[[-hbar/2, hbar/2], [hbar/2, -hbar/2]] * [[x], [y]] = [[0], [0]]`\n    This gives the equation `-x + y = 0`, or `x = y`.\n    The eigenvector is proportional to `[[1], [1]]`. Normalizing it gives `1/sqrt(1^2+1^2) = 1/sqrt(2)`.\n    So, the first eigenstate is `|a1> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [[1], [1]] = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> + |down>)`.\n\n*   For `lambda_2 = -hbar/2`:\n    `(A - (-hbar/2)*I) |v2> = 0`\n    `[[hbar/2, hbar/2], [hbar/2, hbar/2]] * [[x], [y]] = [[0], [0]]`\n    This gives the equation `x + y = 0`, or `x = -y`.\n    The eigenvector is proportional to `[[1], [-1]]`. Normalizing it gives `1/sqrt(1^2+(-1)^2) = 1/sqrt(2)`.\n    So, the second eigenstate is `|a2> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [[1], [-1]] = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> - |down>)`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate\n\nThe probability of measuring the particle in an eigenstate `|a_n>` is given by `P(a_n) = |<a_n | alpha>|^2`.\n\n*   Probability of measuring `lambda_1 = +hbar/2` (`P(a1)`):\n    `<a1|alpha> = [(1/sqrt(2)) * (<up| + <down|)] * [(1/sqrt(7)) * ((1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>)]`\n    `<a1|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * [<up|((1+i)|up>) + <down|((2-i)|down>)]`\n    `<a1|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * [ (1+i) + (2-i) ] = 3 / sqrt(14)`\n    `P(a1) = |3 / sqrt(14)|^2 = 9 / 14`\n\n*   Probability of measuring `lambda_2 = -hbar/2` (`P(a2)`):\n    `<a2|alpha> = [(1/sqrt(2)) * (<up| - <down|)] * [(1/sqrt(7)) * ((1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>)]`\n    `<a2|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * [<up|((1+i)|up>) - <down|((2-i)|down>)]`\n    `<a2|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * [ (1+i) - (2-i) ] = (1/sqrt(14)) * (-1 + 2i)`\n    `P(a2) = |(1/sqrt(14)) * (-1 + 2i)|^2 = (1/14) * ((-1)^2 + 2^2) = (1/14) * (1+4) = 5 / 14`\n\nLet's convert these fractions to decimals:\n`P(a1) = 9 / 14 ≈ 0.6428`\n`P(a2) = 5 / 14 ≈ 0.3571`\nAs a check, `P(a1) + P(a2) = 9/14 + 5/14 = 14/14 = 1`. The probabilities sum to 1.\nThe probabilities are approximately `0.64` and `0.36`.\n\n### 4. Calculate the average (expectation) value of operator A\n\nThe average value `<A>` can be calculated in two ways:\n1.  `<A> = <alpha | A | alpha>`\n2.  `<A> = Sum[P(a_n) * a_n]`, where `a_n` are the eigenvalues.\n\nUsing the second method is simpler:\n`<A> = P(a1)*lambda_1 + P(a2)*lambda_2`\n`<A> = (9/14) * (hbar/2) + (5/14) * (-hbar/2)`\n`<A> = (hbar/2) * (9/14 - 5/14)`\n`<A> = (hbar/2) * (4/14)`\n`<A> = (hbar/2) * (2/7) = hbar / 7`\n\n### 5. Compare with the options\n\n*   Probabilities: `0.64` and `0.36`\n*   Average value: `hbar / 7`\n\nThis matches option B.\nA) 0.28, 0.72 and hbar / sqrt(7)\nB) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar / 7\nC) 0.54, 0.46 and 3*hbar / sqrt(7)\nD) 0.61, 0.29 and 2*hbar / sqrt(7)\n\nThe calculated values align perfectly with option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
