The alcohol's hydroxyl proton (pKa ≈ 16-18) is more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH selectively deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis. This reaction protects the alcohol group by converting it into a benzyl ether.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of a Tosylhydrazone**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and a catalytic amount of HCl.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard condensation reaction. The ketone functional group reacts with the hydrazide to form a tosylhydrazone. The ketone's C=O group is replaced by a C=N-NHTs group.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n\n**Step 3: The Shapiro Reaction**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by an aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl) workup.\n*   **Analysis:** These are the classic conditions for a Shapiro reaction. The strong base (n-BuLi) is used to convert the tosylhydrazone into an alkene. The reaction proceeds through a dianion intermediate, which eliminates nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group to form a vinyllithium species. The aqueous workup protonates this intermediate. The overall result is the replacement of the original ketone with a C=C double bond. It is critical to note that n-BuLi acts as a base here, not as a nucleophile that would add a butyl group.\n*   **Product 3:** 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation and Deprotection**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 is stirred with Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a powerful catalytic hydrogenation that performs two key transformations simultaneously:\n    1.  **Alkene Reduction:** Both carbon-carbon double bonds (the one in the cyclohexene ring and the one in the isopropenyl side chain) are reduced to single bonds. This creates a saturated cyclohexane ring and converts the isopropenyl group into an isopropyl group.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** The H₂/Pd-C system is a standard method for cleaving benzyl ethers. The benzyloxy group (-OCH₂Ph) is cleaved, regenerating the original primary alcohol (-OH).\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) in a 1,3-relationship. The correct name for this structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Conclusion and Evaluation of Options**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, the final product is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**. Now we compare this result with the given options:\n\n*   **A) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene:** This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved in the final step. This is incorrect as H₂/Pd-C is a standard reagent for this cleavage.\n*   **B) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol:** This name perfectly describes the final product derived from the complete reaction sequence.\n*   **C) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide:** This is an incorrect intermediate-like structure.\n*   **D) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This structure incorrectly assumes n-BuLi acts as a nucleophile in the Shapiro reaction and that the benzyl ether is not cleaved.\n\nThe correct answer is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product, Product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Protection of the Alcohol**\n*   **Reaction:** The starting material, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, is treated with sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Analysis:** The starting material has three functional groups: a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene. Sodium hydride is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton, which is the one on the alcohol's hydroxyl group (pKa ≈ 16-18), rather than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). The resulting sodium alkoxide is a nucleophile that attacks benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis. This reaction protects the alcohol by converting the hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) into a benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂OBn).\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of a Tosylhydrazone**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard condensation reaction. The ketone functional group reacts with the hydrazide under acid catalysis to form a tosylhydrazone. The carbonyl group (C=O) is replaced by a C=N-NHTs group.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n\n**Step 3: The Shapiro Reaction**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated at low temperature with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Analysis:** These are the classic conditions for a Shapiro reaction. This reaction converts a tosylhydrazone into an alkene. The strong base (n-BuLi) deprotonates the tosylhydrazone twice, leading to the elimination of nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group. This forms a vinyllithium intermediate, which is then protonated by the aqueous ammonium chloride workup. The overall result is the replacement of the original ketone with a carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Product 3:** 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation and Deprotection**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 is stirred with Pd/C under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a powerful catalytic hydrogenation step that performs two crucial transformations:\n    1.  **Alkene Reduction:** All carbon-carbon double bonds are reduced to single bonds. The double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain are both saturated. This converts the cyclohexene to a cyclohexane ring and the isopropenyl group to an isopropyl group.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** The Pd/C catalyst with H₂ is a standard method for cleaving benzyl ethers. This deprotection step removes the benzyl group and regenerates the original primary alcohol. The benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂OBn) is converted back to a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH).\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group, which maintain their 1,3-relationship. The correct chemical name for this structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the four-step synthesis, the final product is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol. Now, we compare this result with the given options:\n\n*   **A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide:** This is an incorrect structure representing an intermediate that has not undergone the Shapiro reaction.\n*   **B) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This is incorrect. It results from a misunderstanding of the Shapiro reaction (assuming nucleophilic addition of butyl) and fails to account for the final deprotection step.\n*   **C) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene:** This is incorrect. This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved in the final step. Hydrogenolysis is a standard outcome under these conditions.\n*   **D) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol:** This name accurately describes the final product derived from the complete reaction sequence.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to meticulously analyze each step of the multi-step chemical synthesis to determine the structure of the final product, Product 4. I will consider the function of the reagents in each step and how they transform the molecule.\n\n1.  **Step 1 Analysis:** I will examine the reaction of the starting material, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, with sodium hydride (NaH) and benzyl bromide (BnBr). I will identify the most acidic proton to determine which functional group reacts with the base, and then predict the outcome of the subsequent reaction with the electrophile, benzyl bromide. This is a protection step.\n\n2.  **Step 2 Analysis:** I will analyze the reaction of Product 1 with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and catalytic HCl. This is a standard condensation reaction with a ketone, and I will determine the structure of the resulting tosylhydrazone, Product 2.\n\n3.  **Step 3 Analysis:** I will analyze the reaction of Product 2 with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) followed by an aqueous quench. I will recognize these as the conditions for a Shapiro reaction, which converts a tosylhydrazone into an alkene, and predict the structure of Product 3.\n\n4.  **Step 4 Analysis:** I will analyze the reaction of Product 3 with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂). This is a powerful catalytic hydrogenation. I will consider all functional groups in Product 3 that can be reduced or cleaved under these conditions to determine the final structure of Product 4. This includes both alkene reduction and benzyl ether cleavage.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Finally, I will compare the deduced structure of Product 4 with the given options (A, B, C, D) to select the correct answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_synthesis():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a four-step organic synthesis problem to determine the final product.\n    The analysis is based on established chemical principles for each reaction step.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Protection of the alcohol.\n    # Starting material: 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n    # Reagents: 1) NaH, 2) Benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n    # NaH is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton, which is on the alcohol (-OH).\n    # The resulting alkoxide attacks BnBr in a Williamson ether synthesis.\n    # The alcohol is protected as a benzyl ether (-OCH2Ph).\n    # Product 1 is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n    # Step 2: Formation of a tosylhydrazone.\n    # Reagents: p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2), cat.

This molecule has three reactive sites: a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene.\n*   **Reagents:** 1) Sodium hydride (NaH), 2) Benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Analysis:** Sodium hydride is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The proton of the hydroxyl group (-OH) of the alcohol (pKa ≈ 16-18) is more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH selectively deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis. This reaction protects the alcohol group by converting it into a benzyl ether (-CH₂OBn). The ketone and alkene remain unchanged.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of the tosylhydrazone**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1.\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and a catalytic amount of HCl.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard condensation reaction. The ketone functional group reacts with the p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide under acid catalysis to form a tosylhydrazone. A molecule of water is eliminated in this process. The C=O group is converted to a C=N-NHTs group.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n\n**Step 3: The Shapiro Reaction**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2 (the tosylhydrazone).\n*   **Reagents:** 1) n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, 2) aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Analysis:** These are the classic conditions for the Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of a strong base (n-BuLi). This leads to the elimination of nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group, forming a vinyllithium intermediate. The subsequent workup with aqueous ammonium chloride protonates the vinyllithium. The overall result is the conversion of the original ketone into an alkene.\n*   **Product 3:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation and Deprotection**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3.\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a powerful catalytic hydrogenation reaction that has two key effects on Product 3:\n    1.  **Alkene Reduction:** All carbon-carbon double bonds are reduced to single bonds. The double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain are both saturated. This converts the isopropenyl group into an isopropyl group and the cyclohexene ring into a cyclohexane ring.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** The benzyl ether protecting group is cleaved by hydrogenolysis, a standard reaction with H₂/Pd-C. The C-O bond between the oxygen and the benzylic carbon is broken, regenerating the original primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations, the final product has a saturated cyclohexane ring. The isopropenyl group has become an isopropyl group, and the benzyloxymethyl group has become a hydroxymethyl group. The final structure is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group in a 1,3-relationship.

This molecule has three reactive sites: a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Analysis:** Sodium hydride is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The proton of the hydroxyl group (-OH) is significantly more acidic (pKa ≈ 16-18) than the protons alpha to the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). The resulting sodium alkoxide is a potent nucleophile that attacks benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis. This reaction protects the alcohol by converting the hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) into a benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂OBn).

The resulting alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis. This reaction protects the alcohol as a benzyl ether (-OBn), preventing it from reacting in subsequent steps.

This is incorrect.\n\nThe correct answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the multi-step synthesis to determine the structure of the final product, Product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Protection of the Alcohol**\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule has three reactive sites: a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene.\n*   **Reagents:** 1) Sodium hydride (NaH), 2) Benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Analysis:** Sodium hydride is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The proton of the hydroxyl group (-OH) is significantly more acidic (pKa ≈ 16-18) than the α-protons adjacent to the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH selectively deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis. This reaction protects the alcohol group by converting it into a benzyl ether (-OBn). The ketone and alkene functional groups remain unchanged.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of a Tosylhydrazone**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1.\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and a catalytic amount of HCl.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard condensation reaction. The ketone functional group reacts with the p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide under acid catalysis. A molecule of water is eliminated, and the C=O group is converted to a C=N-NHTs group, forming a tosylhydrazone.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n\n**Step 3: The Shapiro Reaction**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2 (the tosylhydrazone).\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Analysis:** These are the classic conditions for the Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of a strong base (n-BuLi). This leads to the elimination of nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group, forming a vinyllithium intermediate. The subsequent workup with aqueous ammonium chloride protonates the vinyllithium. The overall result is the conversion of the original ketone into an alkene, effectively removing the oxygen atom.\n*   **Product 3:** 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation and Deprotection**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3.\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a powerful catalytic hydrogenation step that performs two key transformations simultaneously:\n    1.  **Hydrogenation of Alkenes:** All carbon-carbon double bonds are reduced to single bonds. The double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain are both saturated. This converts the cyclohexene ring to a cyclohexane ring and the isopropenyl group to an isopropyl group.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** The H₂/Pd-C system is a standard and effective method for cleaving benzyl ethers. This deprotection step removes the benzyl group and regenerates the original primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group, which maintain their 1,3-relationship. The correct name for this structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAfter analyzing the complete reaction sequence, the final product is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol. Now, we compare this result with the given options:\n\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: This is an incorrect structure representing an intermediate that has not undergone the Shapiro reaction.\n*   B) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: This is incorrect. It results from a misunderstanding of the Shapiro reaction (it does not add a butyl group) and fails to account for the final deprotection step.\n*   C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: **This is the correct structure for the final product.**\n*   D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: This is incorrect. This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved in the final step, but hydrogenolysis is expected under these conditions.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Protection of the Alcohol**\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.

Matching the Structure to the Given Options**\n\nNow, we match this final product to the options provided in the question:\n\n*   A) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - Incorrect. This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved.\n*   B) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - Incorrect.

This structure results from a misunderstanding of the Shapiro reaction and the final hydrogenation step.\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the multi-step synthesis to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Protection of the Alcohol**\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule has three key functional groups: a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene (isopropenyl group).\n*   **Reagents:** 1) Sodium hydride (NaH), 2) Benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Analysis:** Sodium hydride is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The proton of the hydroxyl group (-OH, pKa ≈ 16-18) is significantly more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH selectively deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis. This reaction protects the alcohol group by converting it into a benzyl ether (-CH₂OBn).\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of a Tosylhydrazone**\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard condensation reaction. The ketone functional group at C1 reacts with the p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide under acid catalysis to form a tosylhydrazone. A molecule of water is eliminated in this process.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n\n**Step 3: The Shapiro Reaction**\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Analysis:** These are the classic conditions for the **Shapiro reaction**. The tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of a strong base (n-BuLi). The base deprotonates the hydrazone twice, and the resulting dianion collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group to form a vinyllithium intermediate. The aqueous ammonium chloride workup then protonates the vinyllithium. The overall result is the conversion of the original ketone into an alkene. It is critical to note that n-BuLi acts as a base here, not as a nucleophile that would add a butyl group.\n*   **Product 3:** 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation and Deprotection**\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a powerful catalytic hydrogenation reaction that has two key effects on Product 3:\n    1.  **Alkene Reduction:** All carbon-carbon double bonds are reduced to single bonds. The double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain are both saturated. This converts the isopropenyl group into an isopropyl group and the cyclohexene ring into a cyclohexane ring.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** The benzyl ether protecting group is cleaved by hydrogenolysis, a standard reaction with H₂/Pd-C. The C-O bond between the oxygen and the benzylic carbon is broken, regenerating the original primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations, the final product has a saturated cyclohexane ring. The isopropenyl group has become an isopropyl group, and the benzyloxymethyl group has become a hydroxymethyl group. The final structure is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group in a 1,3-relationship.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe final product of the four-step synthesis is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\nLet's compare this result with the given options:\n*   **A) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol:** This name accurately describes the final product derived from the complete reaction sequence.\n*   **B) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene:** This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved in the final step. This is incorrect as H₂/Pd-C is a standard reagent for this cleavage.\n*   **C) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This structure results from incorrectly assuming n-BuLi acts as a nucleophile in Step 3 and that the benzyl ether is not cleaved in Step 4.\n*   **D) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide:** This is an intermediate-like structure that has not undergone the Shapiro reaction or hydrogenation.\n\nThe correct answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product, Product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Protection of the Alcohol**\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.

This prepares the molecule for the next step.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n\n**Step 3: The Shapiro Reaction**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by an aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl) workup.\n*   **Analysis:** These are the classic conditions for a Shapiro reaction. The strong base (n-BuLi) deprotonates the tosylhydrazone, leading to the elimination of nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group. This forms a vinyllithium intermediate. The aqueous workup protonates this intermediate. The overall result is the conversion of the original ketone into an alkene. It is crucial to note that n-BuLi acts as a base here, not as a nucleophile that would add a butyl group.\n*   **Product 3:** 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation and Deprotection**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 is stirred with Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a powerful catalytic hydrogenation step that performs two key transformations simultaneously:\n    1.  **Alkene Reduction:** Both carbon-carbon double bonds—the one in the cyclohexene ring and the one in the isopropenyl side chain—are reduced to single bonds. This saturates the ring to cyclohexane and converts the side chain to an isopropyl group.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** The H₂/Pd-C system is a standard and effective method for cleaving benzyl ethers. This deprotection step removes the benzyl group and regenerates the original primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group, which maintain their 1,3-relationship.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe final structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**. Now we compare this result with the given options:\n\n*   **A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide:** This is incorrect. It represents an intermediate-like structure that has not undergone the Shapiro reaction.\n*   **B) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This is incorrect. It results from a misunderstanding of the Shapiro reaction (assuming nucleophilic addition of the butyl group) and fails to account for the final deprotection step.\n*   **C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol:** This is the correct name for the final product derived from the complete and correct reaction sequence.\n*   **D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene:** This is incorrect. This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved in the final step. Hydrogenolysis is an expected outcome under these conditions.\n\nTherefore, the correct structure for product 4 is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product, Product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Protection of the Alcohol**\n*   **Reaction:** The starting material, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, is treated with sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Analysis:** The starting material has three functional groups: a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene. Sodium hydride is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton. The alcohol's hydroxyl proton (pKa ≈ 16-18) is more acidic than the α-protons to the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH selectively deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis.

The strong base (n-BuLi) is used to convert the tosylhydrazone into an alkene. The reaction proceeds via a dianion intermediate, which eliminates nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group to form a vinyllithium species. The aqueous workup protonates this intermediate. The overall result is the replacement of the original ketone with a carbon-carbon double bond. A key point is that n-BuLi acts as a base, not as a nucleophile that would add a butyl group.\n*   **Product 3:** 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation and Deprotection**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 is stirred with Pd/C under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a powerful catalytic hydrogenation step that performs two crucial transformations simultaneously:\n    1.  **Alkene Reduction:** Both carbon-carbon double bonds (in the cyclohexene ring and the isopropenyl side chain) are reduced to single bonds.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product, Product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Protection of the Alcohol**\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule contains three functional groups: a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene.\n*   **Reagents:** 1) Sodium hydride (NaH), 2) Benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Analysis:** Sodium hydride is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The proton of the hydroxyl group (-OH) of the alcohol (pKa ≈ 16-18) is more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH selectively deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis. This reaction protects the alcohol group by converting it into a benzyl ether (-CH₂OBn). The ketone and alkene remain unchanged.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of the Tosylhydrazone**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1.\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and a catalytic amount of HCl.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard condensation reaction. The ketone functional group reacts with the p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide under acid catalysis to form a tosylhydrazone. The C=O group is converted to a C=N-NHTs group.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n\n**Step 3: The Shapiro Reaction**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2 (the tosylhydrazone).\n*   **Reagents:** 1) n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, 2) aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Analysis:** These are the classic conditions for the Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of a strong base (n-BuLi). This leads to the elimination of nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group, forming a vinyllithium intermediate. The subsequent workup with aqueous ammonium chloride protonates the vinyllithium. The overall result is the conversion of the original ketone into an alkene. It is a crucial point that n-BuLi acts as a base here, not as a nucleophile that would add a butyl group.\n*   **Product 3:** 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation and Deprotection**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3.\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a powerful catalytic hydrogenation reaction that has two key effects on Product 3:\n    1.  **Alkene Reduction:** All carbon-carbon double bonds are reduced to single bonds. The double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain are both saturated. This converts the isopropenyl group into an isopropyl group and the cyclohexene ring into a cyclohexane ring.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** The benzyl ether protecting group is cleaved by hydrogenolysis, a standard reaction with H₂/Pd-C. The C-O bond between the oxygen and the benzylic carbon is broken, regenerating the original primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations, the final product has a saturated cyclohexane ring. The isopropenyl group has become an isopropyl group, and the benzyloxymethyl group has become a hydroxymethyl group. The final structure is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group in a 1,3-relationship.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe final product of the four-step synthesis is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\nNow, we compare this result with the given options:\n*   **A) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol:** This name accurately describes the final product derived from the complete reaction sequence.\n*   **B) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene:** This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved in the final step. This is incorrect as H₂/Pd-C is a standard reagent for this cleavage.\n*   **C) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide:** This is an incorrect structure representing an intermediate that has not undergone the Shapiro reaction.\n*   **D) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This structure is incorrect. It results from a misunderstanding of the Shapiro reaction (it does not add a butyl group) and incorrectly retains the benzyl ether.\n\nThe correct answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"

The ketone functional group reacts with the p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide under acid catalysis to form a tosylhydrazone. A molecule of water is eliminated in this process. The C=O group is converted to a C=N-NHTs group.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n\n**Step 3: The Shapiro Reaction**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2 (the tosylhydrazone).\n*   **Reagents:** 1) n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, 2) aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Analysis:** These are the classic conditions for the Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of a strong base (n-BuLi). This leads to the elimination of nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group, forming a vinyllithium intermediate. The subsequent workup with aqueous ammonium chloride protonates the vinyllithium. The overall result is the conversion of the original ketone into an alkene.\n*   **Product 3:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation and Deprotection**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3.\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a powerful catalytic hydrogenation reaction that has two key effects on Product 3:\n    1.  **Alkene Reduction:** All carbon-carbon double bonds are reduced to single bonds. The double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain are both saturated. This converts the isopropenyl group into an isopropyl group and the cyclohexene ring into a cyclohexane ring.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** The benzyl ether protecting group is cleaved by hydrogenolysis, a standard reaction with H₂/Pd-C. The C-O bond between the oxygen and the benzylic carbon is broken, regenerating the original primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations, the final product has a saturated cyclohexane ring. The isopropenyl group has become an isopropyl group, and the benzyloxymethyl group has become a hydroxymethyl group. The final structure is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group in a 1,3-relationship. The name for this structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nNow, we compare the final structure with the given options:\n*   **A) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol:** This name accurately describes the final product derived from the complete reaction sequence.\n*   **B) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide:** This is an incorrect structure representing a tosylhydrazone that has not undergone the Shapiro reaction.\n*   **C) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This structure is incorrect. It results from a misunderstanding of the Shapiro reaction (it does not add a butyl group) and incorrectly retains the benzyl ether.\n*   **D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene:** This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved in the final step. Hydrogenolysis is expected under these conditions.\n\nThe correct answer is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product, Product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Protection of the Alcohol**\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule has three key functional groups: a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene (isopropenyl group).\n*   **Reagents:** 1) Sodium hydride (NaH), 2) Benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Analysis:** Sodium hydride is a strong base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule, which is the proton on the hydroxyl group (-OH) of the alcohol (pKa ≈ 16-18). The resulting alkoxide is a strong nucleophile that attacks the electrophilic benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis. This reaction protects the alcohol by converting it into a benzyl ether (-OBn). The ketone and alkene are unaffected.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of a Tosylhydrazone**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1.\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and a catalytic amount of HCl.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard condensation reaction. The ketone functional group reacts with the hydrazide under acid catalysis to form a tosylhydrazone. The C=O double bond is replaced by a C=N-NHTs double bond.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n\n**Step 3: The Shapiro Reaction**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2 (the tosylhydrazone).\n*   **Reagents:** 1) n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, 2) aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Analysis:** These are the classic conditions for a Shapiro reaction. The strong base (n-BuLi) is used to convert the tosylhydrazone into an alkene. The reaction proceeds via a dianion intermediate, which eliminates nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group to form a vinyllithium species. The aqueous workup protonates this intermediate. The overall result is the replacement of the original ketone with a C=C double bond.\n*   **Product 3:** 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation and Deprotection**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3.\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a powerful catalytic hydrogenation that performs two key transformations simultaneously:\n    1.  **Hydrogenation of Alkenes:** Both carbon-carbon double bonds (the one in the cyclohexene ring and the one in the isopropenyl side chain) are reduced to single bonds. This creates a saturated cyclohexane ring and converts the isopropenyl group into an isopropyl group.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** The H₂/Pd-C system is a standard method for cleaving benzyl ethers. This deprotection step removes the benzyl group and regenerates the original primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group in a 1,3-relationship. The correct IUPAC name for this structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe chemical analysis consistently leads to (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol as the final product. Now, we compare this result with the given options:\n\n*   A) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. This structure results from a misunderstanding of the Shapiro reaction and fails to account for the deprotection step.\n*   B) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved in the final step.\n*   C) **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**: **Correct.** This name accurately describes the final product derived from the complete reaction sequence.\n*   D) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect.

This molecule has three reactive sites: a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Analysis:** Sodium hydride is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The proton of the hydroxyl group (-OH) is significantly more acidic (pKa ≈ 16-18) than the protons alpha to the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). The resulting sodium alkoxide is a potent nucleophile that attacks benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis. This reaction protects the alcohol by converting the hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) into a benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂OBn). The ketone and alkene remain unchanged.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of the tosylhydrazone**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1.\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and a catalytic amount of HCl.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard condensation reaction. The ketone functional group reacts with the hydrazide under acid catalysis to form a tosylhydrazone. The carbonyl oxygen (C=O) is replaced by a C=N-NHTs group.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n\n**Step 3: The Shapiro Reaction**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2 (the tosylhydrazone).\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Analysis:** These are the classic conditions for a Shapiro reaction, which converts a ketone (via its tosylhydrazone) into an alkene. The strong base (n-BuLi) deprotonates the tosylhydrazone twice, leading to the elimination of nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group. This forms a vinyllithium intermediate, which is then protonated by the aqueous workup. The net result is the replacement of the original ketone with a carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Product 3:** 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation and Deprotection**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3.\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere.\n*   **Analysis:** This powerful reduction step performs two crucial transformations simultaneously:\n    1.  **Hydrogenation of Alkenes:** Both carbon-carbon double bonds (in the cyclohexene ring and the isopropenyl side chain) are reduced to single bonds. This saturates the ring to cyclohexane and converts the side chain to an isopropyl group.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of the Benzyl Ether:** H₂/Pd-C is a standard reagent for cleaving benzyl ethers. This deprotection step removes the benzyl group and regenerates the original primary alcohol. The benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂OBn) becomes a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH).\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group, maintaining their 1,3-relationship.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe final structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.

It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The proton of the hydroxyl group (-OH, pKa ≈ 16-18) is significantly more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20).

This reaction protects the alcohol group by converting it into a benzyl ether (-CH₂OBn).\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of a Tosylhydrazone**\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard condensation reaction. The ketone functional group at C1 reacts with the p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide under acid catalysis to form a tosylhydrazone. A molecule of water is eliminated in this process.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n\n**Step 3: The Shapiro Reaction**\n*   **Reagents:** n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Analysis:** These are the classic conditions for the **Shapiro reaction**. The tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of a strong base (n-BuLi). The base deprotonates the hydrazone twice, and the resulting dianion collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group to form a vinyllithium intermediate. The aqueous ammonium chloride workup then protonates the vinyllithium. The overall result is the conversion of the original ketone into an alkene. It is critical to note that n-BuLi acts as a base here, not as a nucleophile that would add a butyl group.\n*   **Product 3:** 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation and Deprotection**\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a powerful catalytic hydrogenation reaction that has two key effects on Product 3:\n    1.  **Alkene Reduction:** All carbon-carbon double bonds are reduced to single bonds. The double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain are both saturated. This converts the isopropenyl group into an isopropyl group and the cyclohexene ring into a cyclohexane ring.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** The benzyl ether protecting group is cleaved by hydrogenolysis, a standard reaction with H₂/Pd-C. The C-O bond between the oxygen and the benzylic carbon is broken, regenerating the original primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations, the final product has a saturated cyclohexane ring. The isopropenyl group has become an isopropyl group, and the benzyloxymethyl group has become a hydroxymethyl group. The final structure is a cyclohexane ring with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group in a 1,3-relationship.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe final product of the four-step synthesis is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\nLet's compare this result with the given options:\n*   **A) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol:** This name accurately describes the final product derived from the complete reaction sequence.\n*   **B) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene:** This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved in the final step. This is incorrect as H₂/Pd-C is a standard reagent for this cleavage.\n*   **C) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol:** This structure results from incorrectly assuming n-BuLi acts as a nucleophile in Step 3 and that the benzyl ether is not cleaved in Step 4.\n*   **D) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide:** This is an intermediate-like structure that has not undergone the Shapiro reaction or hydrogenation.\n\nThe correct answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product, Product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Protection of the Alcohol**\n*   **Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. This molecule has three reactive sites: a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene.\n*   **Reagents:** 1) Sodium hydride (NaH), 2) Benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Analysis:** Sodium hydride is a strong base. It will deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol's hydroxyl proton (pKa ≈ 16-18) is more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH selectively deprotonates the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide. This alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis. This reaction protects the alcohol group by converting it into a benzyl ether (-CH₂OBn).\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of a Tosylhydrazone**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1 (a ketone).\n*   **Reagents:** p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) and a catalytic amount of HCl.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard condensation reaction. The ketone functional group reacts with the hydrazide under acid catalysis to form a tosylhydrazone. The C=O group is replaced by a C=N-NHTs group.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n\n**Step 3: The Shapiro Reaction**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2 (a tosylhydrazone).\n*   **Reagents:** 1) n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at low temperature, 2) aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl).\n*   **Analysis:** These are the classic conditions for a Shapiro reaction. The strong base (n-BuLi) deprotonates the tosylhydrazone twice, leading to the elimination of nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group. This forms a vinyllithium intermediate. The aqueous workup with NH₄Cl protonates this intermediate. The overall result is the conversion of the original ketone into an alkene.\n*   **Product 3:** 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation and Deprotection**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3 (contains two C=C double bonds and a benzyl ether).\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a powerful catalytic hydrogenation that performs two key transformations:\n    1.  **Hydrogenation of Alkenes:** Both the double bond in the cyclohexene ring and the double bond in the isopropenyl side chain are reduced to single bonds. This creates a saturated cyclohexane ring and converts the isopropenyl group into an isopropyl group.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** The H₂/Pd-C system is a standard method for cleaving benzyl ethers. The benzyloxy group is reduced back to the original hydroxyl group (-CH₂OH).\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group, maintaining their 1,3-relationship. The correct name for this structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nNow, we compare the final product's name with the given options:\n*   A) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: This is incorrect. This would be the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved in the final step.\n*   B) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: This is incorrect. This is an intermediate-like structure that has not undergone the final two steps.\n*   C) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: This is incorrect. This structure results from a misunderstanding of the Shapiro reaction and fails to account for the final deprotection step.\n*   D) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: **This is correct.** This name accurately describes the final product derived from the complete reaction sequence.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product, Product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Protection of the Alcohol**\n\n*   **Reaction:** The starting material, 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one, is treated with sodium hydride (NaH) followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Analysis:** Sodium hydride is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton in the molecule. The proton of the hydroxyl group (-OH) is more acidic (pKa ≈ 16-18) than the protons alpha to the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). The resulting alkoxide ion then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis. This protects the alcohol by converting it to a benzyl ether (-OCH₂Ph). The ketone and alkene functionalities remain unchanged.\n*   **Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of a Tosylhydrazone**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) in the presence of catalytic acid (HCl).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a standard condensation reaction. The ketone functional group reacts with the hydrazide to form a tosylhydrazone.

The strong base (n-BuLi) deprotonates the tosylhydrazone twice, leading to the elimination of nitrogen gas (N₂) and the tosyl group. This forms a vinyllithium intermediate. The aqueous workup protonates this intermediate. The net result of this reaction is the conversion of the original ketone into an alkene.\n*   **Product 3:** 5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Catalytic Hydrogenation and Deprotection**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 is stirred with Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen (H₂) atmosphere.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a powerful catalytic hydrogenation that performs two simultaneous transformations on Product 3:\n    1.  **Alkene Reduction:** Both carbon-carbon double bonds (the one in the cyclohexene ring and the one in the isopropenyl side chain) are reduced to single bonds. This saturates the ring to cyclohexane and converts the side chain to an isopropyl group.\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis:** The benzyl ether protecting group is cleaved by the H₂/Pd-C system. This is a standard deprotection method that regenerates the original primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a saturated cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group in a 1,3-relationship. The correct name for this structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the four-step synthesis, the final product is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.
