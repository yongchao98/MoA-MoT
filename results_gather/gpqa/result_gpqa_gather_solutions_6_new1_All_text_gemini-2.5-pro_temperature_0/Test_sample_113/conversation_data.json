It is a nucleophilic addition reaction where a cyanide ion (CN⁻) attacks the carbonyl carbon of the ketone, butan-2-one.\n*   **Mechanism:** The reaction proceeds in two steps.

We must choose between the reagents in the remaining options (B and C).\n    *   `HCl` (hydrochloric acid) is a strong acid and is a standard, effective catalyst for the complete hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.\n    *   `CH₃COOH` (acetic acid) is a weak acid and is generally not strong enough to catalyze this reaction efficiently.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Reagent **B must be HCl**.\n\n### **Step 3: Combine the conclusions and select the final answer**\n\n*   From Step 1, we determined that reagent **A is H₃O⁺**.\n*   From Step 2, we determined that reagent **B is HCl**.\n\nThe correct combination of reagents is A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.

It is an excellent proton source and is the standard reagent for this protonation step.\n    *   `NaHSO₃`: Sodium bisulfite is used for a different reaction (bisulfite addition) and is not the correct reagent for this transformation.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Reagent **A must be H₃O⁺**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the second reaction**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid`\n*   **Reaction Type:** This reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).

This creates a negatively charged alkoxide intermediate.\n    *   **Role of Reagent A:** To form the final, neutral product (a cyanohydrin), the alkoxide intermediate must be protonated. Therefore, reagent A must be a source of protons (H⁺).\n    *   **Evaluating Choices for A:** The options for reagent A are H₃O⁺ and NaHSO₃.\n        *   **H₃O⁺** (hydronium ion) represents an aqueous acid and is an excellent proton source, making it the standard choice for this step.\n        *   **NaHSO₃** (sodium bisulfite) is used in a different reaction to form crystalline bisulfite adducts, primarily for purification, and is not the correct reagent here.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** Reagent **A must be H₃O⁺**. This eliminates options B and D.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 2: Nitrile Hydrolysis**\n    *   **Reaction:** `2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid`\n    *   **Type:** This reaction converts a nitrile functional group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). This is a hydrolysis reaction.\n    *   **Mechanism:** The hydrolysis of a nitrile requires vigorous conditions, typically heating in the presence of water and a strong catalyst.\n    *   **Role of Reagent B:** Reagent B acts as the catalyst for the hydrolysis. We must evaluate the remaining choices for B from the non-eliminated options (A and C). The choices are CH₃COOH and HCl.\n        *   **HCl** (hydrochloric acid) is a strong mineral acid and is a standard, effective catalyst for the complete hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.\n        *   **CH₃COOH** (acetic acid) is a weak acid. It is generally not strong enough to efficiently catalyze this transformation to completion.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** Reagent **B must be HCl**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Reagent A is **H₃O⁺**.\n*   Reagent B is **HCl**.\n\nMatching this combination to the provided options:\nA) A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH\nB) A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl\nC) A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl\nD) A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH\n\nThe correct choice is C, as it provides the correct reagents for both reactions.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reagents for the given reactions.\n\n### **Analysis of the First Reaction**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile`\n*   **Reaction Type:** This reaction is a **cyanohydrin formation**.
