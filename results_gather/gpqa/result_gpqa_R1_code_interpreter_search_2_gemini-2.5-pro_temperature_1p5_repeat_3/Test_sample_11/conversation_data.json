    "This problem involves the decay of a stationary positive pion (Pi+) into a positive muon (mu+) and a muon neutrino (nu). We need to find the kinetic energies (KE) of the product particles using the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\nThe decay process is:\nPi(+) -> mu(+) + nu\n\nGiven data:\n*   Rest mass of Pi(+), `m_pi * c^2` = 139.6 MeV\n*   Rest mass of mu(+), `m_mu * c^2` = 105.7 MeV\n*   The Pi(+) is stationary, so its initial kinetic energy is 0 and initial momentum is 0.\n*   The neutrino (nu) is considered to be massless, so its rest mass `m_nu * c^2` = 0.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivations:\n\n1.  **Conservation of Energy**:\n    The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n    *   **Initial Energy (E_initial)**: Since the Pi(+) is stationary, its total energy is just its rest mass energy.\n        `E_initial = m_pi * c^2 = 139.6 MeV`\n    *   **Final Energy (E_final)**: The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon (mu+) and the neutrino (nu). The total energy of a particle is the sum of its kinetic energy and rest mass energy (`E = KE + m*c^2`).\n        `E_mu = KE_mu + m_mu * c^2`\n        `E_nu = KE_nu + m_nu * c^2 = KE_nu + 0 = KE_nu`\n        So, `E_final = E_mu + E_nu = (KE_mu + m_mu * c^2) + KE_nu`\n    *   **Equating energies**:\n        `E_initial = E_final`\n        `m_pi * c^2 = KE_mu + m_mu * c^2 + KE_nu`\n        The total kinetic energy of the products is:\n        `KE_total = KE_mu + KE_nu = m_pi * c^2 - m_mu * c^2`\n        `KE_total = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV`\n\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum**:\n    The total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n    *   **Initial Momentum (p_initial)**: The Pi(+) is stationary, so `p_initial = 0`.\n    *   **Final Momentum (p_final)**: The two product particles move away from each other.\n        `p_final = p_mu + p_nu`\n    *   **Equating momenta**:\n        `p_initial = p_final`\n        `0 = p_mu + p_nu`\n        This means the momentum vectors are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: `|p_mu| = |p_nu|`. Let's call this magnitude `p`.\n\n3.  **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation**:\n    The relationship between a particle's total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is given by: `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n\n4.  **Solving for the Kinetic Energies**:\n    We have a system of equations. A direct way to solve this is to find the total energy of one of the products. Let's solve for the total energy of the muon (`E_mu`).\n    From momentum conservation, `p_mu*c = p_nu*c = p*c`.\n    For the massless neutrino, its energy `E_nu = p_nu*c = p*c`.\n    From energy conservation, `E_mu = m_pi*c^2 - E_nu = m_pi*c^2 - p*c`.\n\n    Now, substitute `p*c` in the energy-momentum relation for the muon:\n    `E_mu^2 = (p_mu*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2`\n    `E_mu^2 = (m_pi*c^2 - E_mu)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2`\n    Expand the equation:\n    `E_mu^2 = (m_pi*c^2)^2 - 2*(m_pi*c^2)*E_mu + E_mu^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2`\n    Cancel `E_mu^2` from both sides and rearrange to solve for `E_mu`:\n    `2*(m_pi*c^2)*E_mu = (m_pi*c^2)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2`\n    `E_mu = [(m_pi*c^2)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2] / [2 * (m_pi*c^2)]`\n\n    Now, we can calculate the values using Python.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given rest mass energies in MeV\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6  # MeV\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7  # MeV\n\n# Calculate the total energy of the muon (E_mu)\nE_mu = (m_pi_c2**2 + m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# Calculate the kinetic energy of the muon (KE_mu)\n# KE = E_total - rest_mass_energy\nKE_mu = E_mu - m_mu_c2\n\n# Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value)\nKE_total = m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2\n\n# Calculate the kinetic energy of the neutrino (KE_nu)\n# KE_total = KE_mu + KE_nu\nKE_nu = KE_total - KE_mu\n\nprint(f\"Kinetic energy of muon (mu+): {KE_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"Kinetic energy of neutrino (nu): {KE_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\nThe output of the code execution is:\n```\nKinetic energy of muon (mu+): 4.12 MeV\nKinetic energy of neutrino (nu): 29.78 MeV\n```\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV (rounding 29.78) for the neutrino.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\nB) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nC) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\nD) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The decay of a stationary particle into two products is a classic relativistic mechanics problem. We can solve it by applying the laws of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n### 1. Initial State\n*   Particle: Positive Pion (Pi+)\n*   The Pi+ is stationary, so its total initial momentum is zero (`p_initial = 0`).\n*   The total initial energy is its rest mass energy, `E_initial = m_pi * c^2 = 139.6 MeV`.\n\n### 2. Final State\n*   Products: Positive Muon (mu+) and Muon Neutrino (nu)\n*   Let the kinetic energies be `KE_mu` and `KE_nu`.\n*   Let the momenta be `p_mu` and `p_nu`.\n*   The total final energy is `E_final = E_mu + E_nu = (KE_mu + m_mu * c^2) + (KE_nu + m_nu * c^2)`.\n*   We assume the neutrino is massless (`m_nu = 0`), so its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy (`E_nu = KE_nu`). Also, for a massless particle, `E = p*c`, so `KE_nu = p_nu * c`.\n\n### 3. Conservation Laws\n*   **Conservation of Momentum**:\n    `p_initial = p_final`\n    `0 = p_mu + p_nu` (vector sum)\n    This implies that the two product particles fly off in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitude:\n    `|p_mu| = |p_nu| = p`\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy**:\n    `E_initial = E_final`\n    `m_pi * c^2 = (KE_mu + m_mu * c^2) + KE_nu`\n    Rearranging, the total kinetic energy of the products is:\n    `KE_mu + KE_nu = m_pi * c^2 - m_mu * c^2 = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV`\n\n### 4. Calculation\nWe can find the kinetic energies by using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n\nFrom momentum conservation, `p_mu * c = p_nu * c = p*c`.\nSince the neutrino is massless, `KE_nu = E_nu = p_nu * c = p*c`.\n\nNow let's write the energy-momentum relation for the muon:\n`E_mu^2 = (p_mu * c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n`E_mu^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n\nFrom energy conservation, `E_mu = E_initial - E_nu = m_pi * c^2 - KE_nu`. And since `KE_nu = p*c`, we have `E_mu = m_pi * c^2 - p*c`.\n\nSubstitute `p*c = m_pi * c^2 - E_mu` into the muon's energy-momentum equation:\n`E_mu^2 = (m_pi * c^2 - E_mu)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n`E_mu^2 = (m_pi * c^2)^2 - 2(m_pi * c^2)E_mu + E_mu^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n\nCancel `E_mu^2` from both sides and solve for the total energy of the muon, `E_mu`:\n`2(m_pi * c^2)E_mu = (m_pi * c^2)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n`E_mu = [(m_pi * c^2)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2] / [2(m_pi * c^2)]`\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n`E_mu = [ (139.6)^2 + (105.7)^2 ] / [ 2 * 139.6 ]`\n`E_mu = [ 19488.16 + 11172.49 ] / 279.2`\n`E_mu = 30660.65 / 279.2`\n`E_mu ≈ 109.816 MeV`\n\nThe kinetic energy of the muon is its total energy minus its rest mass energy:\n`KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu * c^2`\n`KE_mu = 109.816 MeV - 105.7 MeV ≈ 4.116 MeV`\n\nNow we can find the kinetic energy of the neutrino from the total kinetic energy released:\n`KE_nu = (m_pi * c^2 - m_mu * c^2) - KE_mu`\n`KE_nu = 33.9 MeV - 4.116 MeV ≈ 29.784 MeV`\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are `KE_mu ≈ 4.12 MeV` and `KE_nu ≈ 29.8 MeV`. These values match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
