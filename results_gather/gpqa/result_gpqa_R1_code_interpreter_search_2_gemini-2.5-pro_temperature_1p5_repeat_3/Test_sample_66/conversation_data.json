    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the initial state and the measurement basis.**\n    *   The initial state of the two-electron system is given in the *coupled basis* as $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   Here, $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$ since the electrons are in a p-orbital. The total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$, and the total magnetic quantum number is $m=-1$.\n    *   The measurement is of the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The eigenstates of these operators are the states in the *uncoupled basis*, denoted by $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Identify the final state corresponding to the measurement outcome.**\n    *   We want to find the probability of measuring the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ as $-\\hbar$ and the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{z}$ is $m_z \\hbar$. So, we are looking for the outcome where the individual magnetic quantum numbers are $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   The corresponding final state in the uncoupled basis is $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Relate the initial and final states to calculate the probability.**\n    *   The probability of measuring the system, initially in state $|\\Psi_{initial}\\rangle$, to be in a final state $|\\Psi_{final}\\rangle$ is given by the square of the magnitude of their inner product: $P = |\\langle\\Psi_{final} | \\Psi_{initial}\\rangle|^2$.\n    *   In our case, this is:\n        $P = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$.\n    *   The term $\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle$ is known as a **Clebsch-Gordan coefficient**. It represents the amplitude for finding the system in the uncoupled state $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$ when it is in the coupled state $|l, m\\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Apply the selection rules for addition of angular momentum.**\n    *   A fundamental principle (selection rule) in the addition of angular momentum is that the z-components must add up. For a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle$ to be non-zero, it must satisfy the condition:\n        $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n    *   This rule arises because the total z-component operator $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$ is diagonal in both the coupled and uncoupled bases. The state $|l, m\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of $L_z$ with eigenvalue $m\\hbar$, and the state $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle$ is also an eigenstate of $L_z$ with eigenvalue $(m_1+m_2)\\hbar$. States with different eigenvalues for the same Hermitian operator are orthogonal.\n\n5.  **Check if the selection rule is satisfied.**\n    *   From the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, we have $m = -1$.\n    *   For the desired final state $|1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$, we have $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   The sum of the final magnetic quantum numbers is $m_1 + m_2 = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   Comparing the initial total $m$ with the sum of the final $m_i$:\n        $-1 \\neq -2$.\n    *   Since $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$, the selection rule is not satisfied.\n\n6.  **Conclude the probability.**\n    *   Because the selection rule is not met, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero:\n        $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle = 0$.\n    *   Therefore, the probability is:\n        $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\nThis means it is impossible to measure the system in the state $|1,1,2,-1\\rangle$ and find that *both* electrons have a z-component of orbital angular momentum of $-\\hbar$."
