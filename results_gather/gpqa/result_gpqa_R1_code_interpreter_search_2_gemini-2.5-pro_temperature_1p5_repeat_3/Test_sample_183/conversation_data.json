    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   It is a trisubstituted benzene ring.\n*   The substituents are:\n    *   **-OCH2CH3 (ethoxy group)** at position 1. This is a strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n    *   **-C(CH3)3 (tert-butyl group)** at position 2. This is an activating, ortho, para-director. It is very bulky, which can sterically hinder adjacent positions.\n    *   **-NO2 (nitro group)** at position 3. This is a strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n*   The substitution pattern is 1,2,3 (three adjacent substituents). This is a sterically crowded arrangement and can be challenging to synthesize via standard electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS).\n\n**2. Retrosynthesis (Working Backwards)**\n\nLet's consider the final steps to form the target molecule.\n\n*   **Final step is ether formation?** The ethoxy group (-OEt) can be introduced by a Williamson ether synthesis on the corresponding phenol. This would involve reacting **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol** with a base (like NaOH) followed by an ethyl halide (like EtBr). This is generally a high-yield and reliable reaction. So, this is a plausible last step.\n\n*   **Final step is nitration?** This would involve nitrating **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxybenzene**.\n    *   The ethoxy group (-OEt) is a powerful o,p-director, directing to positions 4 and 6.\n    *   The tert-butyl group (-tBu) is an o,p-director, directing to positions 3 and 5.\n    *   The -OEt group's directing effect is much stronger than the -tBu group's. Therefore, nitration would predominantly occur at positions 4 and 6 (para and ortho to -OEt). The desired position 3 is meta to the -OEt group, so this would be a minor product. This route is not suitable for a high-yield synthesis.\n\n*   **Final step is Friedel-Crafts alkylation?** This would involve reacting **1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene** with tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3. The nitro group is strongly deactivating, making Friedel-Crafts reactions very difficult or impossible. This route is not viable.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most logical synthetic sequence involves preparing **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol** and then converting the hydroxyl group to an ethoxy group in the final step.\n\n**3. Evaluating the Options**\n\nNow, let's analyze the given sequences of reactions to see which one could produce the required phenol intermediate. All options list the reagents, and we must follow the sequence as provided.\n\n*   **Option A:** i) tBuCl/AlCl3; ii) HNO3/H2SO4; iii) SO3/H2SO4; **iv) NaNO2/HCl**...\n    At step (iii), the product is 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid. This molecule does not have an amino group (-NH2). The reagent in step (iv), NaNO2/HCl, is used for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. Since there is no amine to react with, this sequence is chemically incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** i) HNO3/H2SO4; ii) Fe/HCl; **iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3**...\n    Step (i) gives nitrobenzene, and step (ii) gives aniline. Step (iii) is the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amine group (-NH2) to form a complex (-NH2-AlCl3) or an anilinium ion (-NH3+). Both are strongly deactivating and meta-directing. Thus, t-butylation would occur at the meta position, yielding m-tert-butylaniline. Subsequent steps starting from this meta isomer will not lead to the desired 1,2,3 substitution pattern.\n\n*   **Option C:** i) tBuCl/AlCl3; ii) SO3/H2SO4; iii) HNO3/H2SO4; iv) Fe/HCl; v) NaNO2/HCl; **vi) HNO3/H2SO4**...\n    Step (v) forms a diazonium salt. Step (vi) attempts to nitrate this diazonium salt. Diazonium salts are highly unstable and are typically used immediately. Nitrating a diazonium salt under these conditions is not a standard or viable synthetic step. This sequence is chemically flawed.\n\n*   **Option D:** i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3; ii) HNO3/H2SO4; iii) Fe/HCl; iv) HNO3/H2SO4; v) NaNO2/HCl; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat; vii) NaOH/EtBr...\n    Let's trace the major products through this sequence:\n    i.  Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl3 → **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    ii. Nitration of tert-butylbenzene → **p-tert-butylnitrobenzene** (the para isomer is the major product due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group).\n    iii. Reduction of the nitro group with Fe/HCl → **p-tert-butylaniline**.\n    iv. Nitration of p-tert-butylaniline with HNO3/H2SO4. Under these strong acidic conditions, the aniline (-NH2) is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a meta-director.\n        *   We are nitrating **p-tert-butylanilinium ion**.\n        *   The t-butyl group at C1 is an o,p-director, directing to C2 and C6.\n        *   The -NH3+ group at C4 is a m-director, directing to C2 and C6 (relative to the C4 position).\n        *   Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same positions (C2 and C6). This is a case of reinforcing directing effects, leading to a high yield of a single product.\n        *   Product after workup: **4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline**.\n    v.  Diazotization of the amine group (NaNO2/HCl) → **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenediazonium salt**.\n    vi. Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt (H3O+, H2O/Heat) → **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol**.\n    vii. Williamson ether synthesis (NaOH/EtBr) → **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**.\n\n    At this point, we have successfully synthesized an isomer of the target molecule. The sequence of reactions is logical and each step is high-yielding. The isomer produced is 1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene (a 1,2,4-pattern), not the requested 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene (a 1,2,3-pattern).\n    \n    The remaining steps in option D are (viii) SO3/H2SO4 and (ix) dilute H2SO4. These steps involve sulfonation and subsequent desulfonation, which might suggest a Jacobsen rearrangement (migration of an alkyl group). However, a rearrangement from the less sterically hindered 1,2,4 isomer to the highly crowded 1,2,3 isomer is thermodynamically unfavorable.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing the options:\n*   Options A, B, and C contain chemically impossible steps.\n*   Option D describes a coherent, high-yield synthetic pathway, although it leads to a different isomer (1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene) than the one named in the question.\n\nThis discrepancy suggests there is an error in the question itself, most likely in the name of the target molecule. Given the choices, the only one that represents a viable and logical multi-step synthesis is Option D. Therefore, it is the \"best\" answer among the flawed options.\n\n<<<D>>>"
