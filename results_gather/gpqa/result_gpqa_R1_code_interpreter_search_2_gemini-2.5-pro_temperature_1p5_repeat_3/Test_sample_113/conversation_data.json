    "*   **Analysis of Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Reaction:** butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n    *   This is a nucleophilic addition reaction, specifically the formation of a cyanohydrin.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  The cyanide ion (CN⁻), a strong nucleophile from NaCN, attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n        2.  This attack breaks the pi bond of the carbonyl group (C=O), and the electrons move onto the oxygen atom, forming a negatively charged alkoxide intermediate.\n        3.  This alkoxide intermediate is a base and needs to be protonated to form the final stable product, the cyanohydrin, which has a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   **Role of Reagent A:** Reagent A must be a proton source (H⁺) to protonate the alkoxide intermediate.\n    *   **Evaluating Options for A:**\n        *   **H₃O⁺:** This represents an aqueous acid (like HCl or H₂SO₄ dissolved in water). It is an excellent source of protons and is commonly used in the workup step of such reactions to protonate intermediates.\n        *   **NaHSO₃:** Sodium bisulfite is typically used to form crystalline addition products with aldehydes and some ketones for purification purposes, not as a proton source in cyanohydrin formation.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** H₃O⁺ is the correct choice for reagent A. The reaction proceeds by adding NaCN to the ketone, followed by acidification with an acid source represented by H₃O⁺.\n\n*   **Analysis of Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Reaction:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid\n    *   This reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This transformation is known as nitrile hydrolysis.\n    *   **Mechanism:** Nitrile hydrolysis requires the addition of two molecules of water across the carbon-nitrogen triple bond. This process is very slow on its own and needs to be catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base, typically with heating.\n    *   **Role of Reagent B:** Reagent B acts as a catalyst for the hydrolysis.\n    *   **Evaluating Options for B:**\n        *   **HCl (Hydrochloric acid):** This is a strong acid. Strong mineral acids like HCl or H₂SO₄ are standard reagents used to catalyze the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids under aqueous conditions. The reaction proceeds via protonation of the nitrile nitrogen, making the carbon more susceptible to nucleophilic attack by water, eventually leading to the carboxylic acid and an ammonium ion (NH₄⁺).\n        *   **CH₃COOH (Acetic acid):** This is a weak organic acid. It is generally not strong enough to effectively catalyze the complete hydrolysis of a stable nitrile to a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** HCl is the appropriate and effective catalyst for this hydrolysis reaction.\n\n*   **Final Combination:**\n    *   Reagent A should be H₃O⁺.\n    *   Reagent B should be HCl.\n    *   This combination matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
