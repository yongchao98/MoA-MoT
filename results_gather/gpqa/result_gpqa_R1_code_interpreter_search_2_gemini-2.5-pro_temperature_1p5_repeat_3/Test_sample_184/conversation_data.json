    "An elegant way to solve this problem is by calculating the square of the Hamiltonian operator, $H^2$.\n\n1.  **Define the Hamiltonian:**\n    The Hamiltonian is given by $H = \\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n}$, where:\n    *   $\\varepsilon$ is a constant with dimensions of energy.\n    *   $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$ is the vector of Pauli matrices.\n    *   $\\vec{n}$ is an arbitrary unit vector, which means its magnitude is 1, i.e., $|\\vec{n}|^2 = \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{n} = 1$.\n\n2.  **Calculate the square of the Hamiltonian, $H^2$:**\n    $H^2 = (\\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n})^2 = \\varepsilon^2 (\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n})^2$\n\n3.  **Use the properties of Pauli matrices:**\n    There is a very useful identity for Pauli matrices:\n    $(\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{A})(\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{B}) = (\\vec{A} \\cdot \\vec{B})I + i \\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot (\\vec{A} \\times \\vec{B})$\n    where $I$ is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n\n    In our case, both $\\vec{A}$ and $\\vec{B}$ are the same vector $\\vec{n}$. So we set $\\vec{A} = \\vec{B} = \\vec{n}$:\n    $(\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n})(\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n}) = (\\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{n})I + i \\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot (\\vec{n} \\times \\vec{n})$\n    $(\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n})^2 = (\\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{n})I + i \\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot (\\vec{n} \\times \\vec{n})$\n\n4.  **Simplify the expression:**\n    *   Since $\\vec{n}$ is a unit vector, its dot product with itself is its squared magnitude: $\\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{n} = |\\vec{n}|^2 = 1$.\n    *   The cross product of any vector with itself is the zero vector: $\\vec{n} \\times \\vec{n} = \\vec{0}$.\n\n    Substituting these results back into the identity:\n    $(\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n})^2 = (1)I + i \\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot (\\vec{0}) = I$\n\n    So, the square of the operator $(\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n})$ is just the identity matrix.\n\n5.  **Relate $H^2$ to the eigenvalues:**\n    Now we can find $H^2$:\n    $H^2 = \\varepsilon^2 (\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n})^2 = \\varepsilon^2 I$\n\n    Let $\\lambda$ be an eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian $H$, with a corresponding eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle$. By definition:\n    $H|\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda|\\psi\\rangle$\n\n    Now, let's apply the operator $H$ again to this equation:\n    $H(H|\\psi\\rangle) = H(\\lambda|\\psi\\rangle)$\n    $H^2|\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda(H|\\psi\\rangle) = \\lambda(\\lambda|\\psi\\rangle) = \\lambda^2|\\psi\\rangle$\n\n    We have two expressions for $H^2|\\psi\\rangle$:\n    1.  $H^2|\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda^2|\\psi\\rangle$\n    2.  $H^2|\\psi\\rangle = \\varepsilon^2 I |\\psi\\rangle = \\varepsilon^2 |\\psi\\rangle$\n\n    Equating these two expressions gives:\n    $\\lambda^2|\\psi\\rangle = \\varepsilon^2|\\psi\\rangle$\n\n    Since $|\\psi\\rangle$ is an eigenvector, it cannot be the zero vector. Therefore, we can conclude:\n    $\\lambda^2 = \\varepsilon^2$\n\n6.  **Find the eigenvalues:**\n    Taking the square root of both sides gives the possible values for the eigenvalues $\\lambda$:\n    $\\lambda = \\pm \\varepsilon$\n\nThus, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator are $+\\varepsilon$ and $-\\varepsilon$.\n\n<<<D>>>"
