    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to determine the molecular symmetry group of product 3.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Product 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Toluene is treated with nitric acid (HNO₃) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Analysis:** This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction, specifically nitration. The methyl group (-CH₃) on toluene is an ortho-, para-director. The reaction yields a mixture of ortho-nitrotoluene and para-nitrotoluene. Due to less steric hindrance, the para isomer is typically the major product. In sequential reaction problems, we usually proceed with the major product.\n*   **Product 1:** p-nitrotoluene (4-nitrotoluene).\n    *   Structure: A benzene ring with a -CH₃ group at position 1 and a -NO₂ group at position 4.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (p-nitrotoluene) is treated with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄.\n*   **Analysis:** This is an oxidation reaction. MnO₂ is an oxidizing agent. It can oxidize the benzylic methyl group. This oxidation can lead to a carboxylic acid (-COOH) or an aldehyde (-CHO). To decide which product is formed, we must consider the subsequent reaction.\n    *   If Product 2 is the carboxylic acid (p-nitrobenzoic acid), its reaction with acetone and NaOH is not a standard, straightforward transformation that leads to a product with one of the given symmetries.\n    *   If Product 2 is the aldehyde (p-nitrobenzaldehyde), its reaction with acetone and NaOH is a well-known named reaction, the Claisen-Schmidt condensation. This suggests that the aldehyde is the intended intermediate. While MnO₂ is more commonly used for oxidizing benzylic alcohols, its use here to form an aldehyde is the most logical interpretation in the context of the entire sequence.\n*   **Product 2:** p-nitrobenzaldehyde (4-nitrobenzaldehyde).\n    *   Structure: A benzene ring with a -CHO group at position 1 and a -NO₂ group at position 4.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (p-nitrobenzaldehyde) is treated with acetone ((CH₃)₂C=O) and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a base-catalyzed crossed aldol condensation, specifically a Claisen-Schmidt condensation, because one of the carbonyl compounds (p-nitrobenzaldehyde) has no α-hydrogens. The NaOH deprotonates acetone to form an enolate anion (⁻CH₂COCH₃). This enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon of p-nitrobenzaldehyde. The resulting aldol adduct readily dehydrates (loses a water molecule) to form a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n*   **Product 3:** The product is 4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one. Due to steric considerations, the more stable E (trans) isomer will be the major product.\n    *   Structure of (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one: O₂N-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)CH₃\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of Product 3**\n\n*   **Structure for Analysis:** (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n*   **Conformation:** The extensive π-conjugation (from the nitro group, through the benzene ring, the C=C double bond, to the C=O group) favors a planar conformation for all heavy atoms (C, N, O) and the hydrogens on the ring and the double bond.\n*   **Symmetry Elements:** Let's analyze this planar structure for symmetry elements.\n    1.  **Identity (E):** All molecules have this.\n    2.  **Proper axis of rotation (Cₙ):** There is no C₂ axis or any higher-order rotation axis. Rotating the molecule by 180° (or any other fraction of 360° except 360°) around any axis does not result in an identical structure. The two ends of the molecule are different (a nitro group vs. an acetonyl group).\n    3.  **Center of inversion (i):** There is no center of inversion. For any atom at coordinates (x, y, z), there is no identical atom at (-x, -y, -z).\n    4.  **Plane of symmetry (σ):** The molecule has one plane of symmetry: the plane that contains the planar skeleton of the molecule (the benzene ring, nitro group, and the enone chain). The methyl group (-CH₃) can be oriented so that one of its hydrogens also lies in this plane, with the other two positioned symmetrically above and below the plane, making them mirror images of each other.\n    5.  **Improper axis of rotation (Sₙ):** Since there are no Cₙ (n>1) or i, there can be no Sₙ (n>2). S₁ is equivalent to a plane of symmetry (σ).\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule's symmetry elements are only the identity (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ). A molecule possessing only these two symmetry elements belongs to the **Cₛ** point group.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) D₂h - incorrect\nB) C₃ - incorrect\nC) Cₛ - correct\nD) C₂h - incorrect\n\nThe molecular symmetry group of product 3 is Cₛ.\n\n<<<C>>>"
