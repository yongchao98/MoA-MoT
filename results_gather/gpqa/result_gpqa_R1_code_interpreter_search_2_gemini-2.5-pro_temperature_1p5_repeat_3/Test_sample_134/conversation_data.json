    "The reasoning process to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics of the Decay:**\n    The problem provides a Lagrangian term that describes the interaction between a new bosonic field, $X$, and the standard model fermions, $\\psi_f$. The interaction part of the Lagrangian is given by $-\\lambda_f \\bar{\\psi}_f(y) X(y) \\psi_f(y)$. This term describes a vertex where the boson $X$ couples to a fermion-antifermion pair ($f\\bar{f}$). This interaction allows the boson $X$ to decay into a fermion and its corresponding antifermion, a process denoted as $X \\rightarrow f\\bar{f}$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Kinematic Constraint:**\n    For any decay to be physically possible, it must obey the laws of energy-momentum conservation. The most fundamental condition derived from this is that the mass of the decaying particle (the parent particle) must be at least as large as the sum of the masses of the decay products (the daughter particles). This is the condition for the decay to be \"kinematically allowed\".\n\n    For the decay process $X \\rightarrow f\\bar{f}$, the kinematic condition is:\n    $m_X \\ge m_f + m_{\\bar{f}}$\n\n    Since a particle and its antiparticle have identical masses ($m_f = m_{\\bar{f}}$), the condition simplifies to:\n    $m_X \\ge 2m_f$\n\n3.  **Apply the Given Information:**\n    The problem states that the mass of the boson $X$ is $m_X = 6$ GeV. Plugging this value into our kinematic condition, we can find the maximum allowed mass for a fermion $f$ that $X$ can decay into:\n    $6 \\text{ GeV} \\ge 2m_f$\n    Dividing by 2, we get:\n    $m_f \\le 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n    So, the boson $X$ can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair $f\\bar{f}$ as long as the mass of the fermion $f$ is less than or equal to 3 GeV.\n\n4.  **Check Fermion Masses:**\n    Now, we need to compare the masses of all fundamental fermions (quarks and charged leptons, as these are the ones presented in the options) with the 3 GeV threshold. We use the approximate standard values for their masses:\n\n    *   **Quarks:**\n        *   up quark (u): $m_u \\approx 2.2 \\text{ MeV} = 0.0022 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $0.0022 \\le 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow u\\bar{u}$ is **allowed**.\n        *   down quark (d): $m_d \\approx 4.7 \\text{ MeV} = 0.0047 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $0.0047 \\le 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow d\\bar{d}$ is **allowed**.\n        *   strange quark (s): $m_s \\approx 95 \\text{ MeV} = 0.095 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $0.095 \\le 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow s\\bar{s}$ is **allowed**.\n        *   charm quark (c): $m_c \\approx 1.27 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $1.27 \\le 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow c\\bar{c}$ is **allowed**.\n        *   bottom quark (b): $m_b \\approx 4.18 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $4.18 > 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$ is **forbidden**.\n        *   top quark (t): $m_t \\approx 173 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $173 > 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow t\\bar{t}$ is **forbidden**.\n\n    *   **Charged Leptons:**\n        *   electron (e): $m_e \\approx 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.000511 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $0.000511 \\le 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$ is **allowed**.\n        *   muon ($\\mu$): $m_{\\mu} \\approx 105.7 \\text{ MeV} = 0.1057 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $0.1057 \\le 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$ is **allowed**.\n        *   tau ($\\tau$): $m_{\\tau} \\approx 1.777 \\text{ GeV}$. Since $1.777 \\le 3$, the decay $X \\rightarrow \\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$ is **allowed**.\n\n5.  **Compile the Final List of Allowed Decays:**\n    Based on the analysis above, the complete set of kinematically allowed decays of the boson $X$ into charged fermion-antifermion pairs is:\n    $X \\rightarrow c\\bar{c}, s\\bar{s}, u\\bar{u}, d\\bar{d}, \\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}, \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}, e^{+}e^{-}$\n\n6.  **Compare with the Multiple-Choice Options:**\n    *   **A) $X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$** - This option exactly matches our derived list of allowed decays.\n    *   **B)** This option includes the decay to a top-antitop pair ($t\\bar{t}$), which is kinematically forbidden.\n    *   **C)** This option includes the decay to a bottom-antibottom pair ($b\\bar{b}$), which is forbidden, and omits the decay to a charm-anticharm pair ($c\\bar{c}$), which is allowed.\n    *   **D)** This option includes the forbidden decay into $b\\bar{b}$ and omits the allowed decays into $c\\bar{c}$ and $\\mu^+\\mu^-$.\n\nTherefore, the only correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
