    "The user wants to calculate the area of a surface defined by the given metric.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the given metric.\nThe metric is given by:\n$ds^{2} = g_{ij} dx^{i} dx^{j} = \\frac{32}{(4 - x^{2} - y^{2})} (dx^{2} + dy^{2})$\n\nThis is a metric for a 2-dimensional surface embedded in a higher-dimensional space, described by coordinates $(x, y)$. The metric tensor components are:\n$g_{11} = g_{22} = \\frac{32}{4 - x^{2} - y^{2}}$\n$g_{12} = g_{21} = 0$\n\n### Step 2: Set up the area integral.\nThe area element $dA$ in these coordinates is given by $\\sqrt{\\det(g)} \\, dx \\, dy$.\nFirst, we calculate the determinant of the metric tensor $g$:\n$\\det(g) = g_{11} g_{22} - g_{12} g_{21} = \\left(\\frac{32}{4 - x^{2} - y^{2}}\\right)^{2} - 0^{2} = \\frac{32^2}{(4 - x^{2} - y^{2})^2} = \\frac{1024}{(4 - x^{2} - y^{2})^2}$\n\nThe square root of the determinant is:\n$\\sqrt{\\det(g)} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1024}{(4 - x^{2} - y^{2})^2}} = \\frac{32}{4 - x^{2} - y^{2}}$\n\nThe area $A$ is the integral of the area element over the domain of the coordinates $(x, y)$:\n$A = \\iint_D \\sqrt{\\det(g)} \\, dx \\, dy = \\iint_D \\frac{32}{4 - x^{2} - y^{2}} \\, dx \\, dy$\n\n### Step 3: Determine the domain of integration.\nThe metric becomes singular when the denominator is zero, i.e., $4 - x^{2} - y^{2} = 0$, which is equivalent to $x^2 + y^2 = 4$. This is a circle of radius $R=2$. The metric is well-defined for $x^2 + y^2 < 4$. The domain of integration $D$ is therefore the open disk defined by $x^2 + y^2 < 2^2$.\n\n### Step 4: Convert to polar coordinates.\nThe integral is best solved using polar coordinates. Let:\n$x = \\rho \\cos\\theta$\n$y = \\rho \\sin\\theta$\nThen $x^2 + y^2 = \\rho^2$. The differential area element is $dx \\, dy = \\rho \\, d\\rho \\, d\\theta$.\n\nThe domain of integration in polar coordinates is:\n$0 \\le \\rho < 2$\n$0 \\le \\theta < 2\\pi$\n\nSubstituting these into the area integral:\n$A = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32}{4 - \\rho^2} \\rho \\, d\\rho \\, d\\theta$\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate the integral.\nThe integral with respect to $\\theta$ is straightforward:\n$A = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\theta \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32\\rho}{4 - \\rho^2} d\\rho = 2\\pi \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32\\rho}{4 - \\rho^2} d\\rho$\n\nNow we evaluate the integral with respect to $\\rho$. Let's use the substitution $u = 4 - \\rho^2$.\nThen $du = -2\\rho \\, d\\rho$, which means $\\rho \\, d\\rho = -\\frac{1}{2} du$.\nWe also need to change the limits of integration:\n- When $\\rho = 0$, $u = 4 - 0^2 = 4$.\n- When $\\rho \\to 2$, $u \\to 4 - 2^2 = 0$.\n\nThe integral becomes:\n$\\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32\\rho}{4 - \\rho^2} d\\rho = \\int_{4}^{0} \\frac{32}{u} \\left(-\\frac{1}{2} du\\right) = -16 \\int_{4}^{0} \\frac{1}{u} du$\nFlipping the integration limits reverses the sign:\n$= 16 \\int_{0}^{4} \\frac{1}{u} du$\n\nNow, we evaluate this improper integral:\n$16 \\int_{0}^{4} \\frac{1}{u} du = 16 \\left[ \\ln|u| \\right]_{0}^{4} = 16 \\lim_{a \\to 0^+} \\left[ \\ln(u) \\right]_{a}^{4}$\n$= 16 \\left( \\ln(4) - \\lim_{a \\to 0^+} \\ln(a) \\right)$\n\nThe limit of $\\ln(a)$ as $a \\to 0^+$ is $-\\infty$:\n$= 16 \\left( \\ln(4) - (-\\infty) \\right) = 16 (\\ln(4) + \\infty) = +\\infty$\n\nSo, the area is:\n$A = 2\\pi \\times (+\\infty) = +\\infty$\n\nThe area of the pseudosphere with the given metric is infinite.\n\n<<<B>>>"
