    "To determine the geometrical position of the given density matrix in the qubit space (represented by the Bloch sphere), we need to express the density matrix in the form $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$. The vector $\\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)$ is the Bloch vector, which gives the coordinates of the state within the Bloch sphere.\n\nThe components of the Bloch vector can be calculated using the formula:\n$r_k = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_k)$\nwhere $k \\in \\{x, y, z\\}$ and $\\sigma_k$ are the Pauli matrices.\n\nThe given density matrix is:\n$\\rho=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|\\right)$\n\nIn the computational basis, $\\left|0\\right\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\left|1\\right\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe outer products are:\n$\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right| = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right| = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\rho$:\n$\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{2} I$\nThis is the density matrix of a maximally mixed state.\n\nThe Pauli matrices are:\n$\\sigma_x = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$\\sigma_y = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$\\sigma_z = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow, let's compute the components of the Bloch vector $\\vec{r}$:\n\n$r_x = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_x) = \\text{Tr}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_x\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{2}(0+0) = 0$\n\n$r_y = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_y) = \\text{Tr}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_y\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_y) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{2}(0+0) = 0$\n\n$r_z = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_z) = \\text{Tr}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_z\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_z) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{2}(1-1) = 0$\n\nThe Bloch vector is $\\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) = (0, 0, 0)$. This corresponds to the center (origin) of the Bloch sphere.\n\nAlternatively, we can expand the general form $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$:\n$\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1+r_z & r_x-ir_y \\\\ r_x+ir_y & 1-r_z \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nWe compare this with our calculated density matrix $\\rho = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nBy equating the corresponding matrix elements:\n$1+r_z = 1 \\implies r_z=0$\n$1-r_z = 1 \\implies r_z=0$\n$r_x-ir_y = 0 \\implies r_x=0, r_y=0$\n$r_x+ir_y = 0 \\implies r_x=0, r_y=0$\n\nBoth methods yield the same result: $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\nTherefore, the geometrical position of the density matrix in the qubit space is the origin.\n\n<<<B>>>"
