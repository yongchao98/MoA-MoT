    "This problem requires applying the Boltzmann equation, which describes the statistical distribution of atoms among various energy levels in a system in thermal equilibrium. The problem states that the stellar photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which justifies the use of this equation.\n\n**1. The Boltzmann Equation**\n\nThe Boltzmann equation relates the number of atoms in two different energy states (say, an excited state 'b' and a ground state 'a') to the temperature of the system:\n\nN_b / N_a = (g_b / g_a) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n\nWhere:\n*   N_b and N_a are the number of atoms in the excited state and ground state, respectively.\n*   g_b and g_a are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the two states.\n*   ΔE is the energy difference between the states (E_b - E_a).\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.380649 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nThe ratio N_b / N_a is a measure of the excitation of the atoms to level 'b'.\n\n**2. Applying to the Two Stars**\n\nWe have two stars, star_1 and star_2, with effective temperatures T_1 and T_2, respectively. Let's write the Boltzmann equation for each star. The energy levels of the iron atom (ΔE) and their statistical weights (g_b, g_a) are intrinsic properties of the atom and are the same for both stars.\n\nFor star_1 (temperature T_1), the excitation ratio is:\n(N_b / N_a)_1 = (g_b / g_a) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))\n\nFor star_2 (temperature T_2), the excitation ratio is:\n(N_b / N_a)_2 = (g_b / g_a) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\n**3. Using the Information from the Problem**\n\nThe problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... when compared to the iron atoms in star_2\". This means the excitation ratio for star_1 is twice the excitation ratio for star_2:\n\n(N_b / N_a)_1 = 2 * (N_b / N_a)_2\n\nNow, we can substitute the expressions from the Boltzmann equation into this relationship:\n\n(g_b / g_a) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * [ (g_b / g_a) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ]\n\nThe statistical weight term (g_b / g_a) appears on both sides and can be canceled out:\n\nexp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\n**4. Solving for the Relationship between T_1 and T_2**\n\nTo solve this equation, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n\nln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))] = ln[2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))]\n\nUsing the logarithm rules ln(e^x) = x and ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b), we get:\n\n-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))]\n-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\nNow, we rearrange the equation to isolate ln(2):\n\nln(2) = ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1)\n\nFactor out the common term (ΔE / k):\n\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)\n\n**5. Using the Given Numerical Values**\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\n*   ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J\n*   The Boltzmann constant, k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K\n\nLet's calculate the value of the term (ΔE / k):\n\n(ΔE / k) = (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) = 1 K\n\nSubstituting this value back into our equation:\n\nln(2) = 1 * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)\n\nFinally, we combine the fractions inside the parenthesis:\n\n1/T_2 - 1/T_1 = (T_1 / (T_1 * T_2)) - (T_2 / (T_1 * T_2)) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)\n\nThis gives us the final relationship:\n\nln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)\n\nComparing this result to the given options, it matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
