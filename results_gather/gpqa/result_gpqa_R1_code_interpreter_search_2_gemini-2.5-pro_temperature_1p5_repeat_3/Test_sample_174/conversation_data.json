    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Modeling the Radiating System:**\n    *   The problem describes an oscillating charge distribution with a spheroid shape and a symmetry axis (the z-axis).\n    *   Any oscillating charge distribution that is small compared to the wavelength of radiation (`λ`) can be approximated by its lowest non-zero time-varying multipole moment.\n    *   For an oscillation along a specific axis (the z-axis), the dominant mode of radiation is typically electric dipole radiation. The spheroid shape with a symmetry axis oscillating along that axis strongly suggests an oscillating electric dipole `p(t) = p₀ cos(ωt) ẑ`.\n\n2.  **Electric Dipole Radiation Formula:**\n    *   The time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) by an oscillating electric dipole is given by the formula:\n        `dP/dΩ = (μ₀ p₀² ω⁴) / (32π²c) * sin²(θ)`\n    *   Here, `θ` is the angle between the observation direction and the axis of the dipole (the z-axis). `ω` is the angular frequency of oscillation. All other terms are constants for a given dipole.\n\n3.  **Angular Dependence and Maximum Power (A):**\n    *   From the formula, the radiated power depends on the angle `θ` through the term `sin²(θ)`.\n    *   `dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)`\n    *   The maximum power per unit solid angle, `A`, will occur when `sin²(θ)` is at its maximum value.\n    *   The maximum value of `sin²(θ)` is `1`, which happens at `θ = 90°` (i.e., in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\n    *   So, `A = (dP/dΩ)_max ∝ 1`.\n\n4.  **Power at θ = 30°:**\n    *   We need to find the power radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`. We can express this as a fraction of the maximum power `A`.\n    *   Power at 30°: `(dP/dΩ)_(θ=30°) ∝ sin²(30°)`.\n    *   We know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\n    *   Therefore, `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n    *   The fraction of the maximum power `A` radiated at `θ = 30°` is `(sin²(30°)) / (sin²(90°)) = (1/4) / 1 = 1/4`.\n\n5.  **Wavelength (λ) Dependence:**\n    *   The function `f` also depends on the wavelength `λ`. Let's look at the full formula for `dP/dΩ`.\n    *   `dP/dΩ = (μ₀ p₀² ω⁴) / (32π²c) * sin²(θ)`\n    *   The angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` by `ω = 2πf = 2πc/λ`.\n    *   Therefore, the `ω⁴` term means the power is proportional to `(1/λ)⁴`, or `λ⁻⁴`.\n    *   So, a possible form for the function `f` showing its dependence on `λ` is `f ∝ λ⁻⁴`. This dependence is characteristic of dipole radiation and is also the reason for Rayleigh scattering (which explains why the sky is blue), where the scattering cross-section is proportional to `λ⁻⁴`.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The fraction of the maximum power `A` radiated at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n    *   A possible form for the function `f`, representing its wavelength dependence, is **λ⁻⁴**.\n    *   Combining these two results, we match the options provided.\n\nThe correct option is the one that has a fraction of 1/4 and a wavelength dependence of λ⁻⁴.\n\n*   A) 1/2, λ⁻⁴\n*   B) 1/4, λ⁻³\n*   C) 1/4, λ⁻⁴\n*   D) 3/4, λ⁻⁶\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
