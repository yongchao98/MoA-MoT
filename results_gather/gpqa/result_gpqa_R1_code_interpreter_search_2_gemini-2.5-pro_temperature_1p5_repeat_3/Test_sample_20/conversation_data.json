    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Part 1: Identifying Compound A (The one that does not show tautomerism)**\n\nTautomerism is a form of isomerism where isomers, known as tautomers, can readily interconvert. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of an α-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on a carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group).\n\n1.  **Analyze benzoquinone (specifically, p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   Structure: It's a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two ketone (C=O) groups at opposite positions.\n    *   The carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups (α-carbons) are part of the carbon-carbon double bonds within the ring.\n    *   These α-carbons are each bonded to another carbon in the ring, a carbonyl carbon, and a carbon in a double bond. They have no hydrogen atoms attached.\n    *   Since there are no α-hydrogens, benzoquinone cannot undergo the standard keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n\n2.  **Analyze cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   Structure: It's a six-membered saturated ring with three ketone (C=O) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   The carbon atoms at positions 2, 4, and 6 are methylene groups (-CH₂-). Each of these carbons is an α-carbon to *two* adjacent carbonyl groups.\n    *   The hydrogens on these carbons are highly acidic because the resulting negative charge after deprotonation can be stabilized by two carbonyl groups.\n    *   The presence of these acidic α-hydrogens allows the compound to readily tautomerize to its enol form. The most stable enol form is 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is aromatic. The equilibrium heavily favors this stable aromatic enol.\n    *   Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows tautomerism**.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part 2: Identifying Compound B (The one that shows optical isomerism)**\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules. A common feature of a chiral molecule is the presence of a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n1.  **Analyze methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   Structure: The formula is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's examine the central carbon atom (carbon-2). It is bonded to four distinct groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center.\n    *   Molecules with a single chiral center are always chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism (exist as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images called enantiomers).\n    *   Therefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism**.\n\n2.  **Analyze dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   Structure: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans* isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the -COOCH₃ groups on opposite sides of the double bond.\n    *   This molecule is planar. A planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself), which makes it achiral.\n    *   Additionally, it possesses a center of inversion (a point of symmetry) located at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. If you trace a line from any atom through this central point, you will find an identical atom at the same distance on the opposite side.\n    *   A molecule with a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is achiral and cannot be optically active.\n    *   Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism**. (It does show geometric isomerism with its cis counterpart, dimethyl maleate).\n\n*   **Conclusion for Part B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n*   Compound A (no tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis combination matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
