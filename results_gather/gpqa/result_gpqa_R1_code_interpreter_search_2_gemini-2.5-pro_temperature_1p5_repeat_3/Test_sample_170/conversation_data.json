    "An electrophilic substitution reaction, such as bromination, on a substituted benzene ring (C6H5-Y) results in the formation of ortho, meta, and para isomers. The distribution of these isomers, and thus the yield of the para-isomer, is determined by the electronic and steric properties of the substituent Y.\n\n### **Step 1: Classify the substituents**\n\nFirst, we classify the substituents into two main categories:\n1.  **Ortho, para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the ortho and para positions. They are generally electron-donating groups (activating groups) or halogens (which are deactivating but ortho, para-directing).\n2.  **Meta-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They are electron-withdrawing groups (deactivating groups).\n\nLet's classify the substituents for each substance:\n\n*   **1) C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** -CH3 (methyl) is an alkyl group. It's an activating, **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** -COOC2H5 (ester) is a deactivating, **meta-director**.\n*   **3) C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** -Cl (chloro) is a deactivating, **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **4) C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** -NO2 (nitro) is a strongly deactivating, **meta-director**.\n*   **5) C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** -C2H5 (ethyl) is an alkyl group. It's an activating, **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **6) C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** -COOH (carboxyl) is a deactivating, **meta-director**.\n\nThe meta-directors (2, 4, 6) will produce very low yields of the para-isomer, while the ortho, para-directors (1, 3, 5) will produce high yields of the para-isomer. Therefore, any substance from the meta-directing group will have a lower para-yield than any substance from the ortho, para-directing group.\n\n### **Step 2: Order the substances within each group**\n\n**A) Meta-directors (lowest para-yields):**\nFor substances that are meta-directing, a very small amount of ortho and para product is still formed. The yield of the para-isomer is inversely proportional to the strength of the group's deactivating (and thus meta-directing) character. A stronger deactivating group will direct more strongly to the meta position, leaving an even smaller percentage for the para position.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength for these groups is:\n-NO2 (strongest) > -COOH > -COOC2H5 (strongest electron-withdrawing ability)\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing yield of the para-isomer is the reverse of the deactivating strength:\nC6H5-NO2 (4) < C6H5-COOH (6) < C6H5-COOC2H5 (2)\n\n**B) Ortho, para-directors (highest para-yields):**\nFor these substances, the yield of the para-isomer relative to the ortho-isomer depends on a balance of steric and electronic effects. We want to arrange them in order of increasing para-selectivity.\n\n1.  **Toluene (1) vs. Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased size hinders the approach of the electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions more effectively. Consequently, substitution at the less hindered para position is more favored for ethylbenzene than for toluene.\n    *   Yield(para-isomer): Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5)\n\n2.  **Alkylbenzenes (1, 5) vs. Chlorobenzene (3):** The chloro group (-Cl) has two opposing electronic effects: it's strongly electron-withdrawing by induction (-I effect) but electron-donating by resonance (+R effect). The inductive effect is distance-dependent and deactivates the ortho positions more strongly than the para position. This electronic factor, in addition to the steric hindrance of the chlorine atom, strongly favors substitution at the para position. This combined effect makes chlorobenzene highly para-selective, generally more so than simple alkylbenzenes.\n    *   Yield(para-isomer): Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)\n\nCombining the order for the ortho, para-directors gives:\nC6H5-CH3 (1) < C6H5-C2H5 (5) < C6H5-Cl (3)\n\n### **Step 3: Combine the groups for the final order**\n\nNow, we combine the two ordered groups. The meta-directors have the lowest para-yields, followed by the ortho, para-directors.\n\n*   Meta-director order: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Ortho, para-director order: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nCombining them gives the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
