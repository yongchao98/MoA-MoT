As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct conclusion:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Single-Mutant Phenotypes\nFirst, let's understand the role of each gene individually by looking at the single knock-out mutants. The resistance level is compared to a wild-type (WT) control, which has 100% resistance.\n\n*   **g1 mutant (75% resistance):** The loss of gene G1 causes a partial drop in resistance (25% loss). This indicates G1 plays a role in the resistance pathway, but its absence is not catastrophic.\n*   **g2 mutant (0% resistance):** The loss of gene G2 causes a complete loss of resistance. This is a very severe phenotype, suggesting G2 is absolutely essential for this trait.\n*   **g3 mutant (50% resistance):** The loss of gene G3 causes a 50% drop in resistance. This is a more significant impact than the loss of G1, indicating G3 plays a more critical role than G1.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Double-Mutant Phenotypes to Determine Gene Interactions\nDouble mutants are key to understanding how genes work together. We look for epistasis, where the phenotype of one gene's mutation masks the effect of another.\n\n*   **g1g2 mutant (0% resistance):** This double mutant has the same phenotype as the `g2` single mutant (0% resistance). The severe effect of the `g2` mutation completely masks the milder effect of the `g1` mutation (75% resistance). Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G1**. This typically means G2 acts upstream of G1 in the same pathway.\n*   **g2g3 mutant (0% resistance):** Similarly, this double mutant has the same phenotype as the `g2` single mutant (0% resistance). The `g2` mutation's effect masks the `g3` mutation's effect (50% resistance). Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G3**. This further supports that G2 is an upstream gene relative to both G1 and G3.\n\n*   **g1g3 mutant (10% resistance):** This phenotype is different from both the `g1` mutant (75%) and the `g3` mutant (50%). In fact, it's much more severe than either one. This is a classic example of a **synergistic interaction** (also known as synthetic enhancement). It indicates that G1 and G3 likely function in two parallel pathways that contribute to the same outcome (resistance). When both pathways are knocked out, the effect is much greater than the sum of their individual effects. This interaction also means that neither G1 nor G3 is epistatic to the other.\n\n### 3. Synthesize the Findings into a Pathway Model\nBased on the analysis, we can propose a genetic pathway:\n\n1.  **G2 is the upstream regulator:** Since `g2` knockout leads to 0% resistance and is epistatic to both G1 and G3, G2 is the master switch for the pathway. The problem states at least one gene is a transcription factor, and G2 is the prime candidate as it acts upstream to regulate the others.\n\n2.  **G1 and G3 act in parallel:** The synergistic effect of the `g1g3` double mutant strongly suggests that G2 activates two separate, parallel branches, one involving G1 and the other involving G3. Both branches contribute to the final resistance phenotype.\n\n    A visual model would look like this:\n    ```\n        /-> G1 -> (contributes to resistance) \\\n    G2 (Transcription Factor)                             -> Total Resistance\n        \\-> G3 -> (contributes to resistance) /\n    ```\n\n### 4. Evaluate the Answer Choices\nNow, let's check the given options against our conclusions.\n\n*   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: This aligns perfectly with our findings.\n    *   `G1 and G3 show gene redundancy`: This is a very plausible description. The parallel pathways mean the genes have partially redundant (overlapping) functions in conferring resistance. The presence of the G1 pathway partially compensates for the loss of G3, and vice versa. This is the best description of the synergistic interaction among the choices.\n    *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: This is **incorrect**. The `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g1` phenotype (75%).\n\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Correct.\n    *   `G1 and G3 has the same promoter`: This is a specific molecular hypothesis that we cannot confirm from this genetic data. It's plausible but not a direct conclusion.\n    *   `G3 is epistatic towards G1`: Incorrect. The `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g3` phenotype (50%).\n\n*   **C) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   `G1 is a transcription factor`: Incorrect. Our analysis points strongly to G2.\n    *   `G2 and G3 show pleiotropy`: Incorrect. Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits. This experiment only measured one trait (disease resistance).\n    *   `G2 is epistatic towards G1`: This specific statement is correct, but the overall conclusion is flawed because the first premise is wrong.\n\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Correct.\n    *   `G1 and G3 show pleiotropy`: Incorrect, for the reason stated above.\n    *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: Incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion\nOption A contains two correct and central conclusions drawn from the data: G2 is the upstream transcription factor, and G1 and G3 have a relationship best described as gene redundancy (leading to synergy). The third clause (\"G1 is epistatic towards G3\") is factually incorrect based on the data, likely representing an error in the question's construction. However, compared to the other options, which contain more significant errors or unprovable claims, Option A provides the best overall description of the genetic interactions.\n\n<<<A>>>"
