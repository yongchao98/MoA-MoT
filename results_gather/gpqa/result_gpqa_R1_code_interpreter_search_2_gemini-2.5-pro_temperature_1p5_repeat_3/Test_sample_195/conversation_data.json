    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the principle of conservation of energy.**\n    The total energy of the relativistic harmonic oscillator is conserved. The total energy ($E_{total}$) is the sum of the particle's relativistic energy ($E_{particle} = \\gamma mc^2$) and its potential energy ($U(x)$). The term $\\gamma mc^2$ includes both the rest energy ($mc^2$) and the kinetic energy ($K = (\\gamma-1)mc^2$).\n    So, the conserved total energy is:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x)$\n    where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor, $m$ is the rest mass, $c$ is the speed of light, and $v$ is the speed of the mass.\n\n2.  **Determine the potential energy.**\n    The force is given by Hooke's Law, $F = -kx$. The potential energy $U(x)$ is the work done against this force to move the mass from the equilibrium position ($x=0$) to a position $x$.\n    $U(x) = -\\int_0^x F(x') dx' = -\\int_0^x (-kx') dx' = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n3.  **Apply the conservation of energy to two specific points in the oscillation.**\n    *   **Point 1: Maximum amplitude ($x=A$)**\n        At the maximum amplitude, the mass momentarily comes to a stop. Therefore, its velocity is $v=0$.\n        When $v=0$, the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n        The potential energy is at its maximum: $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n        The total energy at this point is:\n        $E_{total} = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n    *   **Point 2: Equilibrium position ($x=0$)**\n        At the equilibrium position, the potential energy is zero: $U(0) = 0$.\n        The kinetic energy, and thus the speed, is at its maximum. Let's call this maximum speed $v_{max}$.\n        The Lorentz factor at this speed is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n        The total energy at this point is:\n        $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max} mc^2 + 0 = \\gamma_{max} mc^2$\n\n4.  **Equate the energies and solve for $v_{max}$.**\n    Since energy is conserved, the total energy at the maximum amplitude is equal to the total energy at the equilibrium position.\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max} mc^2$\n\n    Now, solve for $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2}{mc^2} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    Next, use the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$ to find $v_{max}$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n    Square both sides:\n    $\\gamma_{max}^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}$\n    Rearrange to solve for $v_{max}$:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}$\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}$\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}}$\n\n    Finally, substitute the expression for $\\gamma_{max}$ we found:\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n5.  **Compare the result with the given options.**\n    The derived expression for $v_{max}$ is identical to option D.\n\nLet's also check the non-relativistic limit. If the velocities are small, the maximum potential energy $\\frac{1}{2}kA^2$ must be much smaller than the rest energy $mc^2$. Let $\\epsilon = \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \\ll 1$.\nThe expression becomes $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - (1+\\epsilon)^{-2}}$.\nUsing the binomial approximation $(1+\\epsilon)^n \\approx 1+n\\epsilon$ for small $\\epsilon$:\n$(1+\\epsilon)^{-2} \\approx 1 - 2\\epsilon$\nSo, $v_{max} \\approx c\\sqrt{1 - (1 - 2\\epsilon)} = c\\sqrt{2\\epsilon}$\nSubstituting back $\\epsilon = \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$:\n$v_{max} \\approx c\\sqrt{2 \\left(\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)} = c\\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{mc^2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$\nThis is the classical result ($ \\frac{1}{2}mv_{max}^2 = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$), which confirms our relativistic formula is correct.\n\nThe correct answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
