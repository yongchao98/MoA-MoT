    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the products of the decomposition.**\nThe problem states that a mixture of salts A and B was heated, and the resulting gas mixture was passed through three tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2):** This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H2O). The weight increase of this tube is 3.60 g.\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.02 g/mol\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)2 solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. The weight of this tube did not change, which means no acidic gases were produced in the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The weight increase of the tube corresponds to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.00 g/mol\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 liters of a gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Volume of gas C = 2.24 L\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol\n\n**Step 2: Identify Gas C and verify the law of conservation of mass.**\nThe initial mass of the salt mixture was 7.20 g. The total mass of the gaseous products must also be 7.20 g.\nTotal Mass = Mass(H₂O) + Mass(O₂) + Mass(C)\n7.20 g = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + Mass(C)\nMass(C) = 7.20 - 3.60 - 0.80 = 2.80 g\n\nNow we can determine the molar mass of gas C:\nMolar Mass(C) = Mass(C) / Moles(C) = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\nThe gas C is inert to the reagents used. A gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol is nitrogen (N₂). This is consistent with the decomposition of nitrogen-containing salts.\n\nSo, the decomposition of the 7.20 g mixture yielded:\n*   0.20 mol H₂O\n*   0.025 mol O₂\n*   0.10 mol N₂\n\n**Step 3: Determine the identity of salts A and B.**\nThe products (N₂, H₂O, O₂) contain only nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen. This means the original salts A and B must also be composed solely of these three elements. The salts decompose completely into gases, which suggests they are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids. The most common examples are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nLet's test the hypothesis that the mixture consists of A = NH₄NO₂ and B = NH₄NO₃. We need to consider their decomposition reactions.\n*   Ammonium nitrite decomposition:  NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   Ammonium nitrate has two common decomposition pathways. The one at lower temperatures (~200°C) is NH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O. However, this does not produce the observed O₂ and N₂. At higher temperatures or under certain conditions, a different reaction occurs: 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g). Since the products are N₂, O₂, and H₂O, this second reaction must be the one occurring in this problem.\n\nThe problem states the mixture of A and B is equimolar. Let's say there are `n` moles of A and `n` moles of B.\nLet A = NH₄NO₂ and B = NH₄NO₃.\n\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₂, the products are: `n` moles of N₂ and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₃ (using the second reaction), we first scale the reaction: NH₄NO₃ → N₂ + 0.5O₂ + 2H₂O. So, `n` moles of NH₄NO₃ produce: `n` moles of N₂, `0.5n` moles of O₂, and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n\nNow, let's sum the products from `n` moles of A and `n` moles of B:\n*   Total moles of N₂ = `n` (from A) + `n` (from B) = `2n`\n*   Total moles of H₂O = `2n` (from A) + `2n` (from B) = `4n`\n*   Total moles of O₂ = `0` (from A) + `0.5n` (from B) = `0.5n`\n\nWe can solve for `n` using our experimental data:\n*   From N₂:  `2n` = 0.10 mol  => `n` = 0.05 mol\n*   From H₂O: `4n` = 0.20 mol  => `n` = 0.05 mol\n*   From O₂: `0.5n` = 0.025 mol => `n` = 0.05 mol\n\nAll three calculations yield the same value for `n`, which strongly supports our hypothesis. So, the mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the total mass.**\nLet's check if the mass of 0.05 mol of each salt adds up to 7.20 g.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14.01 + 4(1.01) + 14.01 + 2(16.00) = 64.05 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14.01 + 4(1.01) + 14.01 + 3(16.00) = 80.05 g/mol\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol × 64.05 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 80.05 g/mol)\n*   Total mass = 3.2025 g + 4.0025 g = 7.205 g\n\nThis matches the given initial mass of 7.20 g.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total number of atoms.**\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B, which means the sum of atoms in their respective chemical formulas.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = 8 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = 9 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (atoms in A) + (atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
