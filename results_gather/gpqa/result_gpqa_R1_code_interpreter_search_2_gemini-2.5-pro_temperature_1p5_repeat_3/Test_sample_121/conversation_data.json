    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the multi-step synthesis and the determination of the number of signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of Product 1\n*   **Starting Material:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** Bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride ((CH3CO)2O) with heating.\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents is used to perform an α-bromination of the carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. Acetic anhydride can react with acetic acid to form an enolizable intermediate, and Br2 acts as the halogenating agent. Pyridine serves as a base to neutralize the HBr byproduct. The reaction adds a bromine atom to the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group (the α-carbon).\n*   **Reaction Equation:** CH3COOH + Br2 → BrCH2COOH + HBr\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n### Step 2: Formation of Product 2\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid, BrCH2COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** Ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Reaction Equation:** BrCH2COOH + CH3CH2OH --(H+)--> BrCH2COOCH2CH3 + H2O\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n### Step 3: Formation of Product 3\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate, BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN-), a good nucleophile, attacks the α-carbon and displaces the bromide ion (Br-), which is a good leaving group.\n*   **Reaction Equation:** BrCH2COOCH2CH3 + NaCN → NCCH2COOCH2CH3 + NaBr\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n### Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate, NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH2)5Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a sequential dialkylation reaction followed by cyclization.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** NaH is a strong base that removes one of the acidic α-protons from ethyl cyanoacetate (the protons on the CH2 group between the -CN and -COOEt groups).\n        NCCH2COOEt + NaH → Na+[NCCHCOOEt]− + H2\n    2.  **First Alkylation (Intermolecular):** The resulting carbanion (enolate) attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane.\n        [NCCHCOOEt]− + Br(CH2)5Br → NCCH(COOEt)-(CH2)5Br + Br−\n        The intermediate is ethyl 2-cyano-7-bromoheptanoate.\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** Since excess NaH is used, it deprotonates the remaining acidic α-proton.\n        NCCH(COOEt)-(CH2)5Br + NaH → Na+[NCC(COOEt)-(CH2)5Br]− + H2\n    4.  **Second Alkylation (Intramolecular):** The carbanion on the α-carbon attacks the carbon at the other end of its own chain, displacing the second bromide ion and forming a ring. The ring consists of the α-carbon plus the five carbons from the pentyl chain, resulting in a six-membered ring.\n*   **Final Product 4:** The product is a cyclohexane ring substituted on one carbon (C1) with both a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3). The chemical name is **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexane-1-carboxylate**.\n\n### Step 5: 1H NMR Spectrum of Product 4\n\nNow, let's determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals for ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexane-1-carboxylate.\n\n**Structure:**\n```\n      CN\n      |\n C(1)--COOCH2CH3\n/   \\\nCH2--CH2\n|     |\nCH2--CH2\n \\   /\n  CH2\n```\n\nWe need to identify all sets of chemically non-equivalent protons.\n\n1.  **Ethyl group (-OCH2CH3):**\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (-O**CH2**CH3) are chemically equivalent to each other but distinct from all other protons in the molecule. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The three protons of the methyl group (-OCH2**CH3**) are chemically equivalent to each other. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   Total from the ethyl group = 2 signals.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through C1 (the substituted carbon), C4 (the carbon opposite it), the cyano group, and the ester group.\n    *   This symmetry makes pairs of carbons equivalent: C2 is equivalent to C6, and C3 is equivalent to C5.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** The two protons on any given methylene group in the ring are diastereotopic. This is because C1 is a prochiral center, making the two faces of the ring different. Therefore, the axial and equatorial protons on C2 are chemically distinct. By symmetry, the axial proton on C2 is equivalent to the axial proton on C6, and the equatorial proton on C2 is equivalent to the equatorial proton on C6. This results in **2 distinct signals** for the four protons on C2 and C6.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** Similarly, the axial and equatorial protons on C3 are diastereotopic. By symmetry, they are equivalent to their respective counterparts on C5. This results in **2 distinct signals** for the four protons on C3 and C5.\n    *   **Protons on C4:** The two protons on C4 are also diastereotopic. They lie on the plane of symmetry but have different spatial environments (one axial, one equatorial) relative to the bulky substituents on C1. They are chemically distinct from each other and from all other protons. This results in **2 distinct signals** for the two protons on C4.\n\n**Summary of Signals:**\n*   Signal 1: -O-**CH2**-CH3 (2H)\n*   Signal 2: -O-CH2-**CH3** (3H)\n*   Signal 3: Axial protons on C2/C6 (2H)\n*   Signal 4: Equatorial protons on C2/C6 (2H)\n*   Signal 5: Axial protons on C3/C5 (2H)\n*   Signal 6: Equatorial protons on C3/C5 (2H)\n*   Signal 7: Axial proton on C4 (1H)\n*   Signal 8: Equatorial proton on C4 (1H)\n\nTotal number of distinct hydrogen signals = 2 (from ethyl group) + 6 (from ring) = 8.\n\n<<<A>>>"
