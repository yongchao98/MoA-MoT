    "The user is asking to identify a specific immunological process based on an experimental description.\n\n1.  **Analyze the experimental setup:**\n    *   **Antigen:** GFP-tagged inner capsid proteins of rotavirus. Rotavirus is an intestinal pathogen.\n    *   **Delivery:** Oral gavage, mimicking natural infection route.\n    *   **Tracking:** In vivo imaging shows the GFP-tagged proteins reach Peyer's patches. Peyer's patches are a type of gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), which are secondary lymphoid organs crucial for initiating mucosal immune responses.\n    *   **Cell Isolation:** Proliferating cells are isolated from the Peyer's patches. Cell proliferation is a key feature of lymphocyte activation upon encountering an antigen.\n    *   **Key Finding:** Sequencing the *variable heavy chain gene* of these proliferating cells reveals *high variability*.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the options based on the key finding:**\n    *   **A) Complement activation:** This is a system of plasma proteins that helps opsonize pathogens and induce inflammation. It does not involve genetic changes in lymphocytes.\n    *   **B) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a cellular mechanism that occurs in activated B cells within the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches). It introduces point mutations into the variable regions of immunoglobulin genes (both heavy and light chains). The purpose of SHM is to generate variants of the B cell receptor, allowing for selection of B cells that produce antibodies with higher affinity for the antigen. This process directly leads to \"high variability\" in the variable heavy chain gene of a proliferating B cell population.\n    *   **C) Class switching recombination (CSR):** This process also occurs in activated B cells in germinal centers. It changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain gene, switching the antibody class (e.g., from IgM to IgA or IgG). This affects the antibody's function but does *not* alter the variable region or contribute to the variability observed there.\n    *   **D) V(D)J recombination:** This is the genetic recombination process that occurs in *developing* B cells (in the bone marrow) and T cells (in the thymus) *before* they encounter an antigen. It assembles the variable region gene segments (V, D, and J) to create the initial, diverse repertoire of antigen receptors. While it creates diversity across the entire B cell population, the \"high variability\" found in a specific population of *proliferating* cells in a secondary lymphoid organ *after* antigen exposure is the hallmark of somatic hypermutation, which refines the antigen-binding site.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The experiment describes an active immune response in a Peyer's patch. The proliferating cells are most likely B cells undergoing affinity maturation in a germinal center. The high variability observed specifically in the variable heavy chain gene is the direct result of somatic hypermutation, the process that fine-tunes antibody affinity.\n\n<<<B>>>"
