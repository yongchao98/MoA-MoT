    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of peaks in each HPLC chromatogram.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene, which is achiral.\n*   **Step 1a: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of an alkene with a peroxyacid like mCPBA is an epoxidation, which is a *syn*-addition (the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond).\n    *   A *syn*-addition to a *trans*-alkene results in a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n    *   The intermediate is a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n*   **Step 1b: Acid-catalyzed ring opening.** An epoxide ring is opened by aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) in a process that is an *anti*-addition. The nucleophile (water) attacks from the side opposite the epoxide oxygen, causing an inversion of stereochemistry at the carbon it attacks.\n    *   Let's consider the ring-opening of the racemic epoxide mixture.\n    *   Opening of (4R,5R)-epoxide gives (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (a meso compound).\n    *   Opening of (4S,5S)-epoxide also gives (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (the same meso compound).\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** The overall reaction is an anti-dihydroxylation of a *trans*-alkene, which stereospecifically yields a single **meso** compound: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene, which is achiral.\n*   **Step 2a: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** This is a *syn*-addition.\n    *   A *syn*-addition to a *cis*-alkene results in a *meso* compound.\n    *   The intermediate is *meso*-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n*   **Step 2b: Acid-catalyzed ring opening.** This is an *anti*-addition.\n    *   The ring-opening of the *meso*-epoxide involves the attack of water on either of the two equivalent carbons of the epoxide.\n    *   Attack at one carbon yields (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon yields (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Since attack at either carbon is equally probable, a 50:50 mixture of the two enantiomers is formed.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** The overall reaction is an anti-dihydroxylation of a *cis*-alkene, which stereospecifically yields a **racemic mixture** of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the relationships:\n*   (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** to both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:**\n    *   Standard HPLC separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity).\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment, so they cannot be separated by a standard column. The racemic pair, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, will co-elute and appear as a **single peak**.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated. The meso-diol will have a different retention time from the enantiomeric pair and will appear as a **second peak**.\n    *   Therefore, the standard HPLC chromatogram will show **2 peaks**.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, will be resolved into **two separate peaks**.\n    *   The meso-diol, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also be separated and will appear as its own **third peak**.\n    *   Therefore, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will show **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<B>>>"
