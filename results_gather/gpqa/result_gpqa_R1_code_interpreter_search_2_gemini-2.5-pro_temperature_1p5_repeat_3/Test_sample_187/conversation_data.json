    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Crystal System and Given Parameters:**\n    *   The crystal system is rhombohedral.\n    *   The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. In the context of a rhombohedral lattice defined by primitive vectors, this is interpreted as the magnitude of the primitive lattice vectors, so the lattice parameter `a = 10` Angstrom.\n    *   The inter-axial angles are `α = β = γ = 30°`.\n    *   The Miller indices of the plane are `(h, k, l) = (1, 1, 1)`.\n\n2.  **Select the Correct Formula:**\n    The formula for the interplanar distance `d_hkl` in a rhombohedral crystal system is:\n\n     \n\n    where:\n    *   `d_hkl` is the interplanar distance for the (hkl) planes.\n    *   `a` is the lattice parameter.\n    *   `α` is the inter-axial angle.\n    *   `h, k, l` are the Miller indices.\n\n3.  **Substitute the Given Values into the Formula:**\n    *   `a = 10`\n    *   `α = 30°`\n    *   `h = 1`, `k = 1`, `l = 1`\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    To avoid rounding errors, it is best to use a calculator or a script for the computation. We will use Python.\n\n    The plan for the script is:\n    *   Define the variables: `a`, `h`, `k`, `l`, and the angle `α`.\n    *   Convert the angle `α` from degrees to radians, as trigonometric functions in programming libraries usually require radians.\n    *   Calculate the numerator of the formula: `(h² + k² + l²)sin²α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cos²α - cosα)`.\n    *   Calculate the denominator of the formula: `a²(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)`.\n    *   Calculate `1/d²` by dividing the numerator by the denominator.\n    *   Calculate `d` by taking the square root of the reciprocal of `1/d²`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the given parameters\na = 10.0  # Angstrom\nh, k, l = 1, 1, 1\nalpha_deg = 30.0\n\n# Convert angle to radians for trigonometric functions\nalpha_rad = math.radians(alpha_deg)\n\n# Calculate necessary trigonometric values\ncos_alpha = math.cos(alpha_rad)\nsin_alpha = math.sin(alpha_rad)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the terms for the formula\n# For (111) plane:\nhkl_sum_sq = h**2 + k**2 + l**2          # 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 3\nhkl_cross_sum = h*k + k*l + l*h         # 1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1 = 3\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the numerator and denominator of the 1/d^2 expression\nnumerator = (hkl_sum_sq * sin_alpha**2) + (2 * hkl_cross_sum * (cos_alpha**2 - cos_alpha))\ndenominator_factor = 1 - 3*cos_alpha**2 + 2*cos_alpha**3\ndenominator = a**2 * denominator_factor\n\n# Step 4: Calculate 1/d^2 and then d\none_over_d_squared = numerator / denominator\nd = math.sqrt(1 / one_over_d_squared)\n\nprint(d)\n```\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 9.543 Angstrom.\n\n5.  **Compare the Result with the Given Options:**\n    *   A) 8.95 Angstrom\n    *   B) 9.08 Angstrom\n    *   C) 10.05 Angstrom\n    *   D) 9.54 Angstrom\n\nThe calculated value `d ≈ 9.54` Angstrom matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The user has confirmed the output of the previously generated code. The calculated interplanar distance is `d ≈ 9.543` Angstrom.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n1.  **Formula:** The interplanar distance `d` for a rhombohedral crystal is given by the formula:\n    \n2.  **Given Values:**\n    *   `a = 10` Angstrom\n    *   `α = 30°`\n    *   `(h, k, l) = (1, 1, 1)`\n3.  **Calculation:** The Python code correctly implements the formula by substituting these values.\n    ```python\n    import math\n\n    # Parameters\n    a = 10.0\n    h, k, l = 1, 1, 1\n    alpha_deg = 30.0\n\n    # Convert angle to radians\n    alpha_rad = math.radians(alpha_deg)\n\n    # Trig values\n    cos_alpha = math.cos(alpha_rad)\n    sin_alpha = math.sin(alpha_rad)\n\n    # Numerator of 1/d^2\n    numerator = ((h**2 + k**2 + l**2) * sin_alpha**2) + (2 * (h*k + k*l + l*h) * (cos_alpha**2 - cos_alpha))\n\n    # Denominator of 1/d^2\n    denominator = (a**2) * (1 - 3*cos_alpha**2 + 2*cos_alpha**3)\n\n    # Calculation of d\n    one_over_d_squared = numerator / denominator\n    d = math.sqrt(1 / one_over_d_squared)\n    ```\n4.  **Result:** The execution of the code provided the output `9.542974392310578`.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** This value, when rounded to two decimal places, is `9.54` Angstrom. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
