    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the given reactions.\n\n### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is a Michael Addition reaction. A strong, bulky base (potassium tert-butoxide, t-BuOK) is used to create a nucleophile from the ketone, which then attacks an α,β-unsaturated compound (the Michael acceptor).\n\n2.  **Identify the nucleophile and electrophile:**\n    *   **Ketone (potential nucleophile precursor):** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   **Base:** t-BuOK (potassium tert-butoxide).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (electrophile):** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt).\n\n3.  **Formation of the Enolate (Nucleophile):**\n    *   The base deprotonates an α-carbon (a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) to form an enolate.\n    *   The ketone has two α-carbons: C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon with no α-hydrogens.\n    *   C6 is substituted with a methyl group and one hydrogen atom.\n    *   Therefore, the base can only abstract the proton from C6. This is a regioselective deprotonation.\n    *   The resulting enolate has a double bond between C1 and C6. The negative charge is delocalized, with nucleophilic character primarily at C6.\n\n4.  **Michael Addition:**\n    *   The nucleophilic C6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate. In ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt), the α-carbon is the CH group, and the β-carbon is the CH₂ group.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The double bond of the acrylate shifts, and after a protonation step (e.g., during aqueous workup), the final product is formed.\n\n5.  **Structure and Nomenclature of Product A:**\n    *   The original ketone has an ethyl and a methyl group at C2, and a methyl group at C6.\n    *   The new group, `–CH₂CH₂COOEt` (an ethoxycarbonylethyl group), is added at C6.\n    *   So the final product is a cyclohexanone with substituents at C1 (oxo), C2 (ethyl, methyl), and C6 (methyl, ethoxycarbonylethyl).\n    *   The options provided name the product as a derivative of ethyl propanoate. Let's follow this convention.\n        *   Main chain: `ethyl ... propanoate`.\n        *   The substituent is attached to C3 of the propanoate chain (`-CH₂CH₂-`).\n        *   The substituent is the cyclohexyl ring. To name this ring as a substituent, the point of attachment (the original C6) is numbered as C1'.\n        *   The original C1 (with the `=O` group) is now C2'.\n        *   The original C2 (with the ethyl and methyl groups) is now C3'.\n        *   The original C6 also had a methyl group, which is now on C1'.\n        *   Combining these pieces, the name of the cyclohexyl substituent is: **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n    *   This matches the name for product A in options A and C. This eliminates options B and D.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is also a Michael Addition. A base (KOH) deprotonates the nitroalkane to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate), which acts as the nucleophile.\n\n2.  **Identify the nucleophile and electrophile:**\n    *   **Nitroalkane (nucleophile precursor):** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂-NO₂).\n    *   **Base:** KOH (potassium hydroxide).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile, also known as crotononitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n\n3.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:**\n    *   The α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (the carbon bonded to the -NO₂ group) has two acidic protons. KOH removes one of them to form the nucleophilic nitronate anion: `CH₃CH₂CH⁻-NO₂`.\n\n4.  **Michael Addition:**\n    *   The nucleophilic α-carbon of the nitronate attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   In CH₃-CH=CH-CN, the β-carbon is the `CH` group bonded to the methyl group.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n    *   Protonation by water (H₂O) gives the final product.\n\n5.  **Structure and Nomenclature of Product B:**\n    *   Let's trace the new structure: `(CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂))–(CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN)`.\n    *   To name this compound using IUPAC rules, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The carbon of the nitrile group is C1.\n    *   We find the longest carbon chain that includes C1.\n        *   C1: `-CN`\n        *   C2: `-CH₂-`\n        *   C3: `-CH(CH₃)-`\n        *   C4: `-CH(NO₂)-`\n        *   C5: `-CH₂-`\n        *   C6: `-CH₃`\n    *   The parent chain is six carbons long, so it is a **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Now, we identify the substituents on this chain:\n        *   A **methyl** group at C3.\n        *   A **nitro** group at C4.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n    *   This matches the name for product B in options A and D.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile -> **Correct for both A and B.**\n*   B) A = incorrect, B = incorrect\n*   C) A = correct, B = incorrect\n*   D) A = incorrect, B = correct\n\nThe only option where both products are named correctly is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
