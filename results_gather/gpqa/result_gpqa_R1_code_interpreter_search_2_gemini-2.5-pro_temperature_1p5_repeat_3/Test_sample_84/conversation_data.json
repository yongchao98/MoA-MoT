    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe primary goal is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, Planet1 and Planet2. This ratio is expressed as T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n**2. Formula for Equilibrium Temperature**\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it absorbs from its host star. The formula is:\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\nwhere:\n*   T_star is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   R_star is the radius of the star.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   `A` is the planet's Bond albedo.\n\n**3. Form the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\nWe need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\nT_eq1 = T_star * (1 - A1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))\nT_eq2 = T_star * (1 - A2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))\n\nThe ratio is:\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = [T_star * (1 - A1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))] / [T_star * (1 - A2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))]\n\nThe problem states that the planets orbit the same star, so T_star and R_star are the same for both. It also states that they have the same albedo (A1 = A2). Therefore, these terms cancel out in the ratio:\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt((1 / a1) / (1 / a2))\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\nThe problem now reduces to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes, a2 / a1.\n\n**4. Relate Semi-major Axis to Radial Velocity Data**\nThe radial velocity (RV) data is given in the form of a Doppler shift (Δλ). The maximum radial velocity of the star (the semi-amplitude, K) is related to the maximum Doppler shift by:\nK / c = Δλ / λ₀  =>  K = c * (Δλ / λ₀)\nwhere `c` is the speed of light and λ₀ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit with mass M_p, orbiting a star of mass M_star, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\nThis approximation is valid for M_p << M_star, which is true here. We also assume an edge-on orbit (inclination i ≈ 90°, so sin(i) ≈ 1), which is a reasonable assumption for planets detected by the transit method.\n\nLet's solve this equation for the semi-major axis, `a`:\nK^2 ≈ (M_p^2 / M_star^2) * (G * M_star / a)\nK^2 ≈ (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * a)\na ≈ (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * K^2)\n\nNow substitute the expression for K:\na ≈ (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * [c * (Δλ / λ₀)]^2)\n\nFrom this equation, we can see the relationship between `a` and the given parameters. Since G, M_star, c, and λ₀ are constant for both planets, the semi-major axis `a` is proportional to M_p^2 and inversely proportional to Δλ^2:\na ∝ M_p^2 / Δλ^2\n\n**5. Calculate the Ratio of Semi-major Axes (a2 / a1)**\nUsing the proportionality found in the previous step:\na2 / a1 = (M_p2^2 / Δλ_2^2) / (M_p1^2 / Δλ_1^2)\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)^2\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n*   M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n*   Δλ_1 = 0.03 Å\n*   Δλ_2 = 0.04 Å\n\na2 / a1 = (5 / 7)^2 * (0.03 / 0.04)^2\na2 / a1 = (25 / 49) * (3 / 4)^2\na2 / a1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\na2 / a1 = 225 / 784\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio**\nFrom Step 3, we know that T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1).\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225) / sqrt(784)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\nTo get the final numerical value, we perform the division.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the final ratio\nresult = 15 / 28\nprint(result)\n```\n<execute_code>\n0.5357142857142857\n</execute_code>\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.536. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.53\nB) ~ 0.98\nC) ~ 1.30\nD) ~ 1.05\n\nThe value 0.536 is closest to 0.53.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "**Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main objective is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by:\n    T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n    where:\n    *   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   A is the planet's albedo.\n    *   R_star is the star's radius.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n3.  **Form the Ratio of Temperatures:** We need to find T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n    T_eq1 = T_star * (1 - A1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))\n    T_eq2 = T_star * (1 - A2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))\n\n    The ratio is:\n    (T_eq1 / T_eq2) = [T_star * (1 - A1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))] / [T_star * (1 - A2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))]\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:** The problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so T_star and R_star are the same. It also explicitly states that both planets have the same albedo (A1 = A2). Therefore, the terms T_star, (1-A), and R_star cancel out from the ratio.\n    (T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(1 / (2 * a1)) / sqrt(1 / (2 * a2))\n    (T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt((1 / a1) / (1 / a2))\n    (T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\n    This means the problem is now to find the ratio of the semi-major axes, a2/a1.\n\n5.  **Connect Orbital Distance to Radial Velocity Data:** The radial velocity method provides information about the planet's orbit. For a planet in a circular orbit, the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) of the star is related to the planet's mass (M_p), the star's mass (M_star), and the semi-major axis (a). Assuming the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass (M_p << M_star) and the orbit is viewed nearly edge-on (sin(i) ≈ 1, a reasonable assumption for transiting planets), the formula is:\n    K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n    where G is the gravitational constant.\n\n6.  **Relate K to the Doppler Shift (Δλ):** The maximum observed Doppler shift (Δλ) is related to the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) and the speed of light (c) by the Doppler formula:\n    K / c = Δλ / λ₀  =>  K = c * (Δλ / λ₀)\n    where λ₀ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\n7.  **Derive an Expression for the Semi-Major Axis (a):**\n    First, let's rearrange the RV formula to solve for `a`:\n    K² ≈ (M_p² / M_star²) * (G * M_star / a)\n    K² ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * a)\n    a ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\n    Now, substitute the expression for K from the Doppler shift:\n    a ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * [c * Δλ / λ₀]²)\n\n8.  **Form the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a2 / a1):**\n    a2 / a1 = [(G * M_p2²) / (M_star * [c * Δλ_2 / λ₀]²)] / [(G * M_p1²) / (M_star * [c * Δλ_1 / λ₀]²)]\n\n    The constants G, M_star, c, and λ₀ are the same for both planets and will cancel out:\n    a2 / a1 = (M_p2² / Δλ_2²) / (M_p1² / Δλ_1²)\n    a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)²\n\n9.  **Substitute the Given Values:**\n    *   M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n    *   M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n    *   Δλ_1 = 0.03 Å\n    *   Δλ_2 = 0.04 Å\n\n    a2 / a1 = (5 / 7)² * (0.03 / 0.04)²\n    a2 / a1 = (25 / 49) * (3 / 4)²\n    a2 / a1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\n    a2 / a1 = 225 / 784\n\n10. **Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:**\n    From step 4, we have T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1).\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\n11. **Compute the Numerical Value:**\n    ```python\n    # Calculate the ratio 15/28\n    ratio = 15 / 28\n    print(ratio)\n    ```\n<execute_code>\n0.5357142857142857\n</execute_code>\n    The calculated ratio is approximately 0.536. This value is closest to the option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
