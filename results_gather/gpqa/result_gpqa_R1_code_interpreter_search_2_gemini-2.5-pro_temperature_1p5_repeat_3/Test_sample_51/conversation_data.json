    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe question asks for the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two different energy levels changes. We need to find the value of `Factor = Ratio_unspotted / Ratio_spotted`.\n\n**2. Identify the Relevant Physics Principle**\n\nThe problem deals with the population of atomic energy levels in a stellar photosphere, which is assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The relationship between the populations of two energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation:\n\n`N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T))`\n\nWhere:\n*   `N_j` and `N_i` are the number of atoms in the higher energy level `j` and lower energy level `i`, respectively.\n*   `g_j` and `g_i` are the statistical weights of the levels.\n*   `E_j - E_i` is the energy difference between the levels, which we'll call `ΔE`.\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   `T` is the local temperature of the gas.\n\nLet's define the ratio as `Ratio = N_2 / N_1`. So, `Ratio = (g_2 / g_1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`.\n\n**3. Formulate the Factor**\n\nWe need to calculate the ratio of the ratios at two different temperatures: `T_unspotted` (6000 K) and `T_spotted` (5500 K).\n\n`Ratio_unspotted = (g_2 / g_1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_unspotted))`\n`Ratio_spotted = (g_2 / g_1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spotted))`\n\nThe factor is:\n`Factor = Ratio_unspotted / Ratio_spotted`\n`Factor = [ (g_2 / g_1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_unspotted)) ] / [ (g_2 / g_1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spotted)) ]`\n\nThe statistical weights `(g_2 / g_1)` cancel out:\n`Factor = exp(-ΔE / (k * T_unspotted)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spotted))`\n`Factor = exp( -ΔE/k * (1/T_unspotted - 1/T_spotted) )`\n\n**4. Calculate the Energy Difference (ΔE)**\n\nThe problem states that the transition between the two energy levels corresponds to a wavelength `λ = 1448 Å`. We can calculate the energy difference `ΔE` using the formula `ΔE = hc/λ`.\n\nFor convenience in astrophysical calculations, we can use the constant `hc ≈ 12400 eV·Å`.\n`ΔE = 12400 eV·Å / 1448 Å ≈ 8.5635 eV`\n\n**5. Identify the Temperatures**\n\nThe problem provides the effective temperatures for both scenarios. The most direct approach, and a common approximation in such problems, is to use these effective temperatures as the characteristic temperatures for the photosphere in the Boltzmann equation.\n\n*   `T_unspotted = 6000 K`\n*   `T_spotted = 5500 K`\n\nThe other information (radius, mass, spot coverage) is consistent with these temperatures but not directly needed for the calculation, assuming this simplified approach is intended. The problem states that the overall effective temperature *decreases* to 5500K, implying this is the representative temperature for the spotted star's photosphere as a whole.\n\n**6. Perform the Calculation**\n\nNow we have all the components to calculate the factor. We'll use the Boltzmann constant in units of eV/K, which is `k ≈ 8.617 * 10^-5 eV/K`.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the `ΔE / k` term:\n`ΔE / k = 8.5635 eV / (8.617 * 10^-5 eV/K) ≈ 99379 K`\n\nNow plug this into the exponent of our factor equation:\n`Exponent = -(99379 K) * (1/6000 K - 1/5500 K)`\n`Exponent = -(99379) * (0.00016667 - 0.00018182)`\n`Exponent = -(99379) * (-0.00001515)`\n`Exponent ≈ 1.5057`\n\nFinally, calculate the factor:\n`Factor = exp(1.5057) ≈ 4.507`\n\nThis value is very close to 4.5.\n\nI will use a python script to get a more precise value.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Constants\nk_eV = 8.617333262e-5 # Boltzmann constant in eV/K\nhc_eV_A = 12400     # h*c in eV*Angstrom\n\n# Given values\nT_unspotted = 6000.0  # Temperature without spots in K\nT_spotted = 5500.0    # Overall temperature with spots in K\nwavelength_A = 1448.0 # Wavelength of the transition in Angstrom\n\n# Calculate the energy difference of the transition in eV\ndelta_E_eV = hc_eV_A / wavelength_A\n\n# Calculate the exponent for the factor calculation\n# Factor = exp( -delta_E/k * (1/T_unspotted - 1/T_spotted) )\nexponent = -(delta_E_eV / k_eV) * (1/T_unspotted - 1/T_spotted)\n\n# Calculate the final factor\nfactor = np.exp(exponent)\n\nprint(f\"{factor=}\")\n```\n\n<<<~4.5",
