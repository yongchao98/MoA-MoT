    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (M1) to the total mass of system_2 (M2). This ratio is M1 / M2.\n\n2.  **Recall the Relevant Physics:** For a spectroscopic binary system, the total mass (M = m1 + m2) is related to the orbital period (P) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities (K1 and K2) of the two stars. The formula is derived from Kepler's Third Law and the definition of radial velocity. The full formula is:\n    M_total = (P * (K1 + K2)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i))\n    where:\n    *   M_total is the sum of the masses of the two stars.\n    *   P is the orbital period.\n    *   K1 and K2 are the radial velocity semi-amplitudes.\n    *   G is the gravitational constant.\n    *   `i` is the inclination of the orbital plane to the line of sight.\n\n3.  **Use Key Information from the Problem:** The problem states that both systems \"exhibit eclipses.\" An eclipsing binary system is one where one star passes in front of the other from our point of view. This can only happen if the inclination `i` is very close to 90 degrees. For i = 90°, sin(i) = 1, and therefore sin³(i) = 1. This simplifies the mass formula significantly:\n    M_total ≈ (P * (K1 + K2)³) / (2 * π * G)\n\n4.  **Set up the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio M1 / M2. We can write the expression for each mass and then divide them.\n    M1 = (P1 * (K1a + K1b)³) / (2 * π * G)\n    M2 = (P2 * (K2a + K2b)³) / (2 * π * G)\n\n    M1 / M2 = [ (P1 * (K1a + K1b)³) / (2 * π * G) ] / [ (P2 * (K2a + K2b)³) / (2 * π * G) ]\n\n    The constant term `(2 * π * G)` cancels out, leaving a simpler ratio:\n    M1 / M2 = (P1 / P2) * [ (K1a + K1b) / (K2a + K2b) ]³\n\n5.  **Plug in the Given Values:**\n    *   For system_1: P1 = 2 years, K1a = 10 km/s, K1b = 5 km/s.\n        *   Sum of velocities (K_sum_1) = 10 + 5 = 15 km/s.\n    *   For system_2: P2 = 1 year, K2a = 15 km/s, K2b = 10 km/s.\n        *   Sum of velocities (K_sum_2) = 15 + 10 = 25 km/s.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Ratio:** Substitute these values into the ratio formula.\n    M1 / M2 = (2 / 1) * [ 15 / 25 ]³\n    M1 / M2 = 2 * (3/5)³\n    M1 / M2 = 2 * (27 / 125)\n    M1 / M2 = 54 / 125\n\n7.  **Compute the Final Numerical Value:** To find the decimal value and compare it with the options, I will perform the division. I will use a short Python script for precision.\n\n```python\n# Data for System 1\nP1 = 2.0  # years\nK1a = 10.0  # km/s\nK1b = 5.0  # km/s\n\n# Data for System 2\nP2 = 1.0  # year\nK2a = 15.0  # km/s\nK2b = 10.0  # km/s\n\n# Calculate the sum of velocity amplitudes for each system\nK_sum_1 = K1a + K1b\nK_sum_2 = K2a + K2b\n\n# Calculate the mass ratio M1 / M2\n# The formula is (P1 / P2) * (K_sum_1 / K_sum_2)^3\nmass_ratio = (P1 / P2) * (K_sum_1 / K_sum_2)**3\n\nprint(mass_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.432\n</execute_result>\n\nThe calculated ratio M1 / M2 is 0.432.\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated value is 0.432. The given options are:\n    A) ~ 0.7\n    B) ~ 1.2\n    C) ~ 0.6\n    D) ~ 0.4\n\n    The value 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The mass of a spectroscopic binary system can be determined using the formula derived from Kepler's third law, which relates the total mass of the system (M_total = m1 + m2) to the orbital period (P) and the radial velocity semi-amplitudes (K1 and K2). The formula is:\n\nM_total = P * (K1 + K2)³ / (2 * π * G * sin³(i))\n\nWhere:\n- M_total is the total mass of the system.\n- P is the orbital period.\n- K1 and K2 are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities of the two stars.\n- G is the gravitational constant.\n- `i` is the inclination of the orbital plane with respect to the line of sight.\n\nThe problem states that both systems are eclipsing binaries. This is a crucial piece of information because eclipses can only occur if the inclination `i` is very close to 90 degrees. When i = 90°, sin(i) = 1, and sin³(i) = 1. This simplifies the mass formula significantly, as the `sin³(i)` term becomes 1.\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the mass of system_1 (M1) to the mass of system_2 (M2).\n\nM1 / M2 = [P1 * (K1a + K1b)³ / (2πG)] / [P2 * (K2a + K2b)³ / (2πG)]\n\nThe term (2πG) is a constant and cancels out, leaving us with:\n\nM1 / M2 = (P1 / P2) * [(K1a + K1b) / (K2a + K2b)]³\n\nNow, let's plug in the given values:\n\n**For System 1:**\n- Period (P1) = 2 years\n- Velocity amplitudes (K1a, K1b) = 10 km/s and 5 km/s\n- Sum of velocities = 10 + 5 = 15 km/s\n\n**For System 2:**\n- Period (P2) = 1 year\n- Velocity amplitudes (K2a, K2b) = 15 km/s and 10 km/s\n- Sum of velocities = 15 + 10 = 25 km/s\n\nNow, substitute these values into the ratio equation:\n\nM1 / M2 = (2 / 1) * (15 / 25)³\nM1 / M2 = 2 * (3 / 5)³\nM1 / M2 = 2 * (27 / 125)\nM1 / M2 = 54 / 125\nM1 / M2 = 0.432\n\nThe calculated ratio is 0.432, which is approximately 0.4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
