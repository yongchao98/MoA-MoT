    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Process:** The problem describes the annihilation of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) into four new particles, two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. The reaction is:\n    $p+\\bar{p}\\rightarrow2A^{+}+2A^{-}$\n\n2.  **Apply Conservation Laws:** In any particle physics reaction, energy and momentum are conserved.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Initial State (Before Annihilation):**\n    *   We have a proton and an antiproton.\n    *   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". This implies its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. We can assume it is effectively at rest.\n    *   In such a scenario, for the annihilation to occur, the proton must also be at rest or moving slowly. The simplest and most common setup to analyze is the center-of-mass frame, where the total initial momentum is zero. This corresponds to both particles being essentially at rest.\n    *   **Total Initial Energy ($E_i$):** The total energy is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and antiproton, as their kinetic energies are negligible.\n        *   $E_i = E_{p} + E_{\\bar{p}}$\n        *   Since a particle and its antiparticle have the same mass, $m_p = m_{\\bar{p}}$.\n        *   $E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 m_p c^2$.\n    *   The rest mass energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) is a known physical constant, approximately 938.27 MeV.\n        *   $E_i = 2 \\times 938.27 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.54 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   **Total Initial Momentum ($P_i$):** Since both particles are at rest or moving very slowly with equal and opposite velocities, the total initial momentum is zero.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Final State (After Annihilation):**\n    *   The final state consists of four particles: $2A^+$ and $2A^-$. Since $A^+$ and $A^-$ are a particle-antiparticle pair, they have the same mass, $m_A$.\n    *   We are given the rest mass energy of particle A: $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   **Total Final Energy ($E_f$):** The total final energy is the sum of the total energies of the four A particles. The total energy of a single relativistic particle is given by $E = \\gamma m c^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor and $v$ is its velocity.\n        *   $E_f = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\times (\\gamma_A m_A c^2)$.\n    *   **Total Final Momentum ($P_f$):** By the law of conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero, since the initial momentum was zero. This means the four final particles must be moving in such a way that their vector sum of momenta cancels out.\n    *   Due to the symmetry of the final state (four particles of identical mass) and conservation of energy, the available energy will be distributed equally among the four particles. Therefore, each of the A particles will have the same total energy and thus the same speed, $v_A$.\n\n5.  **Equate Initial and Final Energy:**\n    *   From the conservation of energy, $E_i = E_f$.\n    *   $2 m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma_A m_A c^2$\n\n6.  **Solve for the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma_A$):**\n    *   We can rearrange the equation to solve for $\\gamma_A$:\n        $\\gamma_A = \\frac{2 m_p c^2}{4 m_A c^2} = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 m_A c^2}$\n    *   Now, we plug in the known values:\n        $\\gamma_A = \\frac{938.27 \\text{ MeV}}{2 \\times 300 \\text{ MeV}} = \\frac{938.27}{600} \\approx 1.5638$\n\n7.  **Solve for the Velocity ($v_A$):**\n    *   The Lorentz factor is related to velocity by the formula $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$, where $\\beta = v/c$.\n    *   We can solve for $\\beta$:\n        $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n        $1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    *   Substitute the calculated value of $\\gamma_A$:\n        $\\beta_A = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n    *   $\\beta_A \\approx 0.7688$\n    *   Therefore, the velocity of particle A is $v_A = 0.7688c$.\n\n8.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) 0.91c\n    *   B) 0.77c\n    *   C) 0.96c\n    *   D) 0.86c\n    Our calculated value of approximately 0.77c matches option B.\n\nTo ensure precision, the calculation can be done using a script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nm_p_c2 = 938.272  # Rest mass energy of a proton in MeV\nm_A_c2 = 300      # Rest mass energy of particle A in MeV\n\n# Total initial energy (E_i)\n# Assuming proton and antiproton are at rest\n# E_i = m_p*c^2 + m_pbar*c^2 = 2 * m_p*c^2\nE_i = 2 * m_p_c2\n\n# Total final energy (E_f)\n# E_f = 4 * E_A = 4 * gamma_A * m_A * c^2\n# By conservation of energy, E_i = E_f\n# 2 * m_p_c2 = 4 * gamma_A * m_A_c2\n\n# Solve for gamma_A\ngamma_A = (2 * m_p_c2) / (4 * m_A_c2)\ngamma_A = m_p_c2 / (2 * m_A_c2)\n\n# Solve for beta_A (v_A / c)\n# gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2)  =>  beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2)\nbeta_A = math.sqrt(1 - 1/gamma_A**2)\n\nprint(f\"Lorentz factor (gamma) for particle A: {gamma_A:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Velocity of particle A (as a fraction of c): {beta_A:.4f}\")\n```\nExecution of the code confirms the result.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem involves the annihilation of a proton and an antiproton, which is governed by the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation:\n\n1.  **Identify the process and conservation laws:**\n    The nuclear reaction is $p + \\bar{p} \\rightarrow 2A^+ + 2A^-$.\n    In this process, both total energy and total momentum are conserved.\n\n2.  **Analyze the initial state (before annihilation):**\n    *   The system consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    *   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which implies its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. For momentum to be conserved, we consider the reaction in the center-of-mass frame where the total initial momentum is zero. This means we can treat both the proton and antiproton as effectively being at rest.\n    *   The total initial energy ($E_{\\text{initial}}$) is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and antiproton. A particle and its antiparticle have the same mass, so $m_p = m_{\\bar{p}}$.\n    *   The rest mass energy of a proton is a well-known value: $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.3 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   Therefore, the total initial energy is:\n        $E_{\\text{initial}} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 m_p c^2 = 2 \\times 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   The total initial momentum is $P_{\\text{initial}} = 0$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the final state (after annihilation):**\n    *   The final state has four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. Since $A^+$ and $A^-$ are a particle-antiparticle pair, they have the same mass, $m_A$.\n    *   The rest mass energy of particle A is given as $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   By conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero ($P_{\\text{final}} = 0$).\n    *   The total final energy ($E_{\\text{final}}$) is the sum of the total energies of the four resulting particles. Due to the symmetry of the problem (annihilation from rest into four particles of identical mass), the total energy is distributed equally among them. Thus, each particle A has the same speed, $v$, and the same total energy, $E_A$.\n    *   The total energy of a single relativistic particle is given by $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The total final energy is:\n        $E_{\\text{final}} = 4 E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$.\n\n4.  **Apply Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   Set the initial energy equal to the final energy:\n        $E_{\\text{initial}} = E_{\\text{final}}$\n        $2 m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n5.  **Solve for the velocity of particle A:**\n    *   First, solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{2 m_p c^2}{4 m_A c^2} = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 m_A c^2}$\n    *   Substitute the given values:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{938.3 \\text{ MeV}}{2 \\times 300 \\text{ MeV}} = \\frac{938.3}{600} \\approx 1.5638$\n    *   Now, use the definition of the Lorentz factor to solve for the velocity $v$. Let $\\beta = v/c$.\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n    *   Rearrange the equation to solve for $\\beta$:\n        $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n        $1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    *   Substitute the calculated value of $\\gamma$:\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911} \\approx 0.7688$\n    *   Therefore, the velocity of particle A is $v = 0.7688c$.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated velocity is approximately $0.77c$. Comparing this to the given options:\n    A) 0.91c\n    B) 0.77c\n    C) 0.96c\n    D) 0.86c\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
