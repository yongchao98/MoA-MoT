One  hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The star has an effective temperature (Teff) of 6000K, and the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000K. As only one hemisphere is spotty, photometric time-series observations will reveal periodic variations in brightness due to rotational modulation. Interestingly, this situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the relative radius of a hypothetical exoplanet (`R_pl / R_star`) that would cause the same drop in brightness as the rotational modulation of a star with spots on one hemisphere.\n\n2.  **Model the Flux Variation:** The brightness variation is caused by the rotation of the star, which alternately shows a fully bright hemisphere and a hemisphere partially covered by cooler, darker spots.\n    *   **Maximum Flux (F_max):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is facing the observer. The observed flux is proportional to the star's effective temperature to the fourth power, according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law (`F ∝ A * T^4`). Let's consider the radiating area of the stellar disk to be normalized to 1.\n        `F_max ∝ T_eff^4`\n    *   **Minimum Flux (F_min):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere is facing the observer. The total flux is the sum of the flux from the bright part of the hemisphere and the flux from the dark spots.\n        *   The fraction of the visible disk covered by spots is `f = 0.20`.\n        *   The fraction of the visible disk that is unspotted is `1 - f = 0.80`.\n        *   The temperature of the spots is `T_spot = T_eff - 1000K = 6000K - 1000K = 5000K`.\n        The minimum flux is a weighted average of the flux from the two components:\n        `F_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_eff^4 + f * T_spot^4`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Amplitude of Variation:** The amplitude of the photometric signal is the relative change in flux between the maximum and minimum brightness states.\n    `Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max = 1 - (F_min / F_max)`\n    Substituting the expressions for `F_max` and `F_min`:\n    `Amplitude = 1 - [((1 - f) * T_eff^4 + f * T_spot^4) / T_eff^4]`\n    `Amplitude = 1 - [(1 - f) + f * (T_spot / T_eff)^4]`\n    `Amplitude = 1 - 1 + f - f * (T_spot / T_eff)^4`\n    `Amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4)`\n\n4.  **Relate Amplitude to Exoplanet Transit:** An exoplanet transit causes a dip in the star's brightness. The depth of this transit (the relative drop in flux, `ΔF/F`) is equal to the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area, assuming a central transit.\n    `Transit Depth = ΔF/F = (Area_planet) / (Area_star)`\n    `Transit Depth = (π * R_pl^2) / (π * R_star^2) = (R_pl / R_star)^2`\n    We are looking for the case where the transit depth is equal to the amplitude of the spot modulation.\n    `(R_pl / R_star)^2 = Amplitude`\n\n5.  **Compute the Final Value:** Now, we combine the equations and plug in the numbers.\n    `(R_pl / R_star)^2 = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4)`\n    `R_pl / R_star = sqrt( f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4) )`\n\nI will now use a Python script to perform the calculation with the given values:\n*   `f = 0.20`\n*   `T_eff = 6000` K\n*   `T_spot = 5000` K\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given parameters\nf = 0.20  # Filling factor of spots\nT_eff = 6000.0  # Effective temperature of the star in Kelvin\nT_spot = 5000.0  # Temperature of the spots in Kelvin\n\n# 1. Calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation due to spots.\n# Amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4)\namplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\n\n# 2. Relate the amplitude to the transit depth of a hypothetical exoplanet.\n# The transit depth is given by (R_planet / R_star)^2.\n# We set this equal to the amplitude calculated above.\n# (R_pl / R_star)^2 = amplitude\n\n# 3. Solve for the relative radius (R_pl / R_star).\n# R_pl / R_star = sqrt(amplitude)\nrelative_radius = math.sqrt(amplitude)\n\nprint(relative_radius)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.3217924401876545\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated relative radius `R_pl / R_star` is approximately 0.3218.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Objective**: Determine the relative radius of an exoplanet (`R_pl / R_star`) that would produce the same light curve amplitude as a star with a specific spot configuration.\n\n2.  **Model the Flux from the Star**: The observed flux (brightness) of the star changes as it rotates, showing either its unspotted hemisphere or its spotted hemisphere. We can model the flux based on the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the flux radiated per unit area is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature (`F ∝ T^4`).\n\n3.  **Maximum Flux (F_max)**: This occurs when the observer sees the hemisphere that has no spots.

This means 20% of this hemisphere's area is covered by spots.\n    *   The remaining area of the hemisphere is `1 - f = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80`, which radiates at the normal effective temperature `T_eff`.\n    *   The spot temperature is `T_spot = T_eff - 1000 K = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K`.\n    *   The total flux from this hemisphere is a weighted sum of the flux from the unspotted part and the spotted part.\n    *   `F_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_eff^4 + f * T_spot^4`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Amplitude of the Spot-Induced Variation**: The amplitude of the signal is the relative change in flux between the maximum and minimum states.\n    *   `Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max = 1 - (F_min / F_max)`\n    *   Substituting the expressions for `F_max` and `F_min`:\n        `Amplitude = 1 - [((1 - f) * T_eff^4 + f * T_spot^4) / T_eff^4]`\n    *   Simplify the expression:\n        `Amplitude = 1 - (1 - f) - f * (T_spot / T_eff)^4`\n        `Amplitude = f - f * (T_spot / T_eff)^4`\n        `Amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4)`\n\n6.  **Model the Exoplanet Transit**: The dimming caused by an exoplanet transiting its star (the transit depth) is equal to the ratio of the planet's projected area to the star's projected area.\n    *   `Transit Depth = Area_planet / Area_star = (π * R_pl^2) / (π * R_star^2) = (R_pl / R_star)^2`\n\n7.  **Equate the two phenomena**: We are looking for the case where the transit depth is equal to the amplitude of the spot modulation.\n    *   `(R_pl / R_star)^2 = Amplitude`\n    *   `(R_pl / R_star)^2 = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4)`\n\n8.  **Solve for the relative radius**: Take the square root of both sides.\n    *   `R_pl / R_star = sqrt( f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4) )`\n\n9.  **Calculation**: Plug in the given values:\n    *   `f = 0.20`\n    *   `T_eff = 6000 K`\n    *   `T_spot = 5000 K`\n    *   `R_pl / R_star = sqrt( 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)^4) )`\n    *   `R_pl / R_star = sqrt( 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)^4) )`\n    *   `R_pl / R_star = sqrt( 0.20 * (1 - 625/1296) )`\n    *   `R_pl / R_star = sqrt( 0.20 * (671/1296) )`\n    *   `R_pl / R_star = sqrt( 0.20 * 0.51775 )`\n    *   `R_pl / R_star = sqrt( 0.10355 )`\n    *   `R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218`\n\nThe calculated value of `R_pl / R_star` is approximately 0.32.
