    "This question asks about the fundamental symmetries that must be respected when constructing the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). SMEFT is an extension of the Standard Model (SM) that includes higher-dimensional operators, suppressed by a large energy scale Î›. The construction of SMEFT is based on a set of core principles. Let's analyze each of the listed symmetries.\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry:** The Standard Model is a relativistic quantum field theory. This means its predictions must be the same for all inertial observers, which is the essence of Lorentz invariance (invariance under rotations and boosts). SMEFT is also formulated as a relativistic quantum field theory, building upon the SM. Therefore, all terms in the SMEFT Lagrangian, including the higher-dimensional operators, must be constructed to be Lorentz scalars. This ensures that the theory's dynamics are independent of the observer's inertial frame. Thus, Lorentz symmetry must be respected.\n\n2.  **Poincare Symmetry:** Poincare symmetry is a broader symmetry group that includes Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts) as well as spacetime translations (translations in space and time). In quantum field theory, invariance under spacetime translations leads to the fundamental conservation laws of energy and momentum. Just like Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry is a cornerstone of the framework of both the Standard Model and SMEFT. The action (the integral of the Lagrangian density over spacetime) is required to be invariant under Poincare transformations. This is a fundamental assumption in constructing the theory.\n\n3.  **CP Symmetry:** CP symmetry is the combination of Charge Conjugation (C) and Parity (P) transformations. While the electromagnetic and strong interactions respect CP symmetry, the weak interaction does not. CP violation is an experimentally confirmed phenomenon in the Standard Model, arising from a complex phase in the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix. Since the Standard Model itself violates CP, its effective field theory extension (SMEFT) is not required to preserve this symmetry. In fact, many of the higher-dimensional operators in SMEFT introduce new sources of CP violation beyond the CKM phase, and searching for their effects is an active area of research. Therefore, CP symmetry is *not* a required symmetry for all operators in SMEFT.\n\n4.  **CPT Symmetry:** CPT symmetry is the combination of Charge Conjugation (C), Parity (P), and Time Reversal (T) transformations. The CPT theorem is a fundamental result in quantum field theory which states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be invariant under the combined CPT transformation. Since SMEFT is constructed as a local and Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory, it must respect CPT symmetry. This is considered an automatic consequence of the framework's basic assumptions, not an extra imposition. All operators in the SMEFT are constructed to be CPT-invariant.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Lorentz Symmetry (1) **must** be respected.\n*   Poincare Symmetry (2) **must** be respected.\n*   CP Symmetry (3) is **not** required to be respected.\n*   CPT Symmetry (4) **must** be respected due to the CPT theorem.\n\nTherefore, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry. This corresponds to options 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
