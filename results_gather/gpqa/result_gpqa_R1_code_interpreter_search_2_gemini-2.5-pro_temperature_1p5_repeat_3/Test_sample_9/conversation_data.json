    "*   **Analysis of the Options**\n\n    1.  **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This option serves as our baseline. By definition, it has Earth's density, which is approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n    2.  **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is explicitly stated as being about 5.5 g/cm³, which is essentially the same as Earth's density.\n\n    3.  **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** For a rocky planet, density is not constant with mass, even if the composition is the same. The planet's own gravity compresses its material. A planet with less mass than Earth will have weaker self-gravity. This weaker gravity results in less compression of its internal materials (like its iron core and silicate mantle). Therefore, for the same composition, a less massive planet will be \"fluffier\" and have a lower average density than Earth. For example, Mars has about 11% of Earth's mass but a density of only 3.93 g/cm³.\n\n    4.  **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** This is a \"super-Earth\". Following the same principle as in the previous point, a more massive planet will have much stronger self-gravity. This intense gravity will significantly compress the materials it's made of. Even though the planet is made of the same \"stuff\" as Earth, that stuff will be squeezed into a proportionally smaller volume. Density is mass divided by volume (ρ = m/V). Since the mass is much larger (5x) and the volume is compressed to be less than 5 times Earth's volume, the resulting density will be significantly *higher* than Earth's density.\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n\n    Comparing the options:\n    *   Planet (a) has a density of ~5.51 g/cm³.\n    *   Planet (b) has a density of ~5.5 g/cm³.\n    *   Planet (d) will have a density lower than 5.51 g/cm³.\n    *   Planet (c) will have a density significantly higher than 5.51 g/cm³ due to gravitational compression.\n\n    Therefore, the planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times the mass will be the densest.\n\n<<<C>>>"
