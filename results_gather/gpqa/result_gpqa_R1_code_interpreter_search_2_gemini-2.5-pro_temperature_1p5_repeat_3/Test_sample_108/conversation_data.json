    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which partial wave is not permitted.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. Let's break down this term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`:\n*   **Total Spin (S):** `2S+1 = 1` implies `S=0`. This is a spin-singlet state.\n*   **Orbital Angular Momentum (L):** The letter `S` corresponds to `L=0`.\n*   **Total Angular Momentum (J):** The number `0` corresponds to `J=0`. This is consistent with the vector addition `J = L + S` (`|0-0| <= J <= 0+0`, so `J=0`).\n*   **Parity (P):** The parity of a two-nucleon system is given by `P = P(N1) * P(N2) * (-1)^L`. Since nucleons have intrinsic parity `+1`, `P = (+1)(+1)(-1)^L`. For the `1S0` state, `L=0`, so the initial parity is `P(initial) = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n*   **Isospin (T):** The generalized Pauli exclusion principle for two identical nucleons requires the total wavefunction to be antisymmetric upon particle exchange. The total wavefunction is a product of space, spin, and isospin parts: `Ψ_total = Ψ_space * Ψ_spin * Ψ_isospin`.\n    *   `Ψ_space` has symmetry `(-1)^L`. For `L=0`, it is symmetric (+1).\n    *   `Ψ_spin` for `S=0` (singlet) is antisymmetric (-1).\n    *   `Ψ_isospin` for two nucleons has symmetry `(-1)^(T+1)`.\n    *   For `Ψ_total` to be antisymmetric (-1), we need: `(symmetric) * (antisymmetric) * (isospin symmetry) = -1`.\n    *   `(+1) * (-1) * (-1)^(T+1) = -1`. This simplifies to `(-1)^(T+1) = +1`, which means `T+1` must be even. Therefore, the initial isospin `T` must be odd. For a two-nucleon system, the only possible odd value is `T=1`.\n\nSo, the initial state `1S0` has: `J=0`, `P=+1`, `T=1`.\n\n### 2. Identify the Conservation Laws and Constraints\n\nThe reaction is `NN(1S0) -> NN(final) + X`. We need to check three conditions for the transition to be permitted.\n\n**Condition 1: Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J)**\nThe initial total angular momentum is `J(initial) = 0`. The final total angular momentum must also be 0.\nThe final state consists of the final NN system (with total angular momentum `J(NN)`) and the particle X (with orbital angular momentum `l_X` and some intrinsic spin `S_X`).\n`J(final) = J(NN) + l_X + S_X` (vector sum).\nFor `J(final)` to be 0, the simplest case (and a common assumption if `S_X` is not given) is that `X` is a spin-0 particle (like a pion). If `S_X = 0`, then angular momentum conservation `J(initial) = J(NN) + l_X` (vector sum) implies that `J(NN) = l_X`.\n\n**Condition 2: Conservation of Parity (P)**\nThe initial parity is `P(initial) = +1`. The final parity must be `P(final) = +1`.\n`P(final) = P(NN, final) * P(X) * (-1)^l_X`.\n*   `P(NN, final) = (-1)^L(NN)`.\n*   `P(X) = -1` (given).\n*   `l_X` is the orbital angular momentum of particle X.\nSo, the conservation equation is `+1 = (-1)^L(NN) * (-1) * (-1)^l_X = -1 * (-1)^(L(NN) + l_X)`.\nThis requires `(-1)^(L(NN) + l_X) = -1`, which means the sum `L(NN) + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n**Condition 3: Pauli Statistics for the Final NN State**\nThe problem states that `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\nIt also specifies that the final NN state has `T(NN) = 0`.\nSubstituting `T(NN)=0` into the condition gives: `0 = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\nThis means `S(NN) + L(NN)` must be an **odd** number.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nLet's check each of the given final states against these three rules.\n\n**A) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**\n*   Final NN State (`7D1`): `2S+1=7` -> `S(NN)=3`. This state is not possible for a two-nucleon system, as the spins of two spin-1/2 particles can only couple to `S=0` or `S=1`. So this reaction is forbidden because the final state is unphysical. However, we check the transition rules as requested.\n*   Final NN State: `S(NN)=3`, `L(NN)=2` (D-state), `J(NN)=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`-wave): `l_X=1`.\n*   Check 1 (J-conservation): `J(NN) = 1`, `l_X = 1`. `J(NN) = l_X`. **(OK)**\n*   Check 2 (Parity): `L(NN) + l_X = 2 + 1 = 3` (odd). **(OK)**\n*   Check 3 (Pauli): `S(NN) + L(NN) = 3 + 2 = 5` (odd). **(OK)**\nThe transition itself satisfies all rules, but the state `7D1` is impossible for nucleons.\n\n**B) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**\n*   Final NN State (`3P0`): `2S+1=3` -> `S(NN)=1`. `L(NN)=1` (P-state). `J(NN)=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`-wave): `l_X=0`.\n*   Check 1 (J-conservation): `J(NN) = 0`, `l_X = 0`. `J(NN) = l_X`. **(OK)**\n*   Check 2 (Parity): `L(NN) + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **(OK)**\n*   Check 3 (Pauli): `S(NN) + L(NN) = 1 + 1 = 2` (even). This **violates** the condition that `S(NN) + L(NN)` must be odd for a `T(NN)=0` state. **(FAIL)**\n\n**C) `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`**\n*   Final NN State (`3S1`): `S(NN)=1`, `L(NN)=0` (S-state), `J(NN)=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`-wave): `l_X=1`.\n*   Check 1 (J-conservation): `J(NN) = 1`, `l_X = 1`. `J(NN) = l_X`. **(OK)**\n*   Check 2 (Parity): `L(NN) + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1` (odd). **(OK)**\n*   Check 3 (Pauli): `S(NN) + L(NN) = 1 + 0 = 1` (odd). **(OK)**\nThis reaction is permitted.\n\n**D) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n*   Final NN State (`3D3`): `S(NN)=1`, `L(NN)=2` (D-state), `J(NN)=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`-wave): `l_X=3`.\n*   Check 1 (J-conservation): `J(NN) = 3`, `l_X = 3`. `J(NN) = l_X`. **(OK)**\n*   Check 2 (Parity): `L(NN) + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5` (odd). **(OK)**\n*   Check 3 (Pauli): `S(NN) + L(NN) = 1 + 2 = 3` (odd). **(OK)**\nThis reaction is permitted.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOption (B) is the only one that violates one of the explicit rules governing the transition (specifically, the Pauli principle for the final state). While option (A) involves a physically impossible state for two nucleons, the question asks to check the partial waves using the provided conservation laws and statistics. Option (B) fails this check.\n\n<<<B>>>"
