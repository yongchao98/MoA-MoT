    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Operator and its Components**\n    The problem provides the components of the quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$:\n    *   $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    These are the components of the spin angular momentum operator $\\vec{S} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\vec{\\sigma}$, where $\\vec{\\sigma}$ are the Pauli matrices. This is expected for a spin-1/2 particle like a muon.\n\n2.  **Define the Direction Vector**\n    The operator is considered along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane. A unit vector $\\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane can be parameterized using a single angle $\\theta$, which represents the angle the vector makes with the z-axis. In Cartesian coordinates, this vector is:\n    $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$\n    Note that the y-component is zero, as it lies in the x-z plane.\n\n3.  **Construct the Operator along the Direction $\\vec{n}$**\n    The operator along the direction $\\vec{n}$, denoted as $P_n$, is the dot product of the operator vector $\\vec{P}$ and the direction vector $\\vec{n}$:\n    $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n} = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n    Substituting the components of $\\vec{P}$ and $\\vec{n}$:\n    $P_n = \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) \\sin\\theta + \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) (0) + \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) \\cos\\theta$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\sin\\theta \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\cos\\theta \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n    Combine the matrices:\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n4.  **Set up the Eigenvalue Equation**\n    We need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$. The eigenvalue equation is:\n    $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$\n    $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n    We can cancel the constant $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ from both sides:\n    $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n5.  **Solve for the Eigenvector Components**\n    This matrix equation gives us a system of two linear equations:\n    1) $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n    2) $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n\n    Let's work with the first equation to find the relationship between $a$ and $b$:\n    $b \\sin\\theta = a - a \\cos\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n    $b = a \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n\n    To simplify this expression, we use the trigonometric half-angle identities:\n    *   $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)$\n    *   $\\sin\\theta = 2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)$\n\n    Substituting these into the expression for $b$:\n    $b = a \\frac{2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)} = a \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = a \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n\n    So, the unnormalized eigenvector is $|\\psi\\rangle = a \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n6.  **Normalize the Eigenvector**\n    For a state vector in quantum mechanics, the norm must be 1. That is, $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1$.\n    Substituting $b = a \\tan(\\theta/2)$:\n    $|a|^2 + |a \\tan(\\theta/2)|^2 = 1$\n    $|a|^2 (1 + \\tan^2(\\theta/2)) = 1$\n    Using the identity $1 + \\tan^2(x) = \\sec^2(x)$:\n    $|a|^2 \\sec^2(\\theta/2) = 1$\n    $|a|^2 = \\frac{1}{\\sec^2(\\theta/2)} = \\cos^2(\\theta/2)$\n\n    Choosing the simplest phase (real and positive), we get $a = \\cos(\\theta/2)$.\n    Now we can find $b$:\n    $b = a \\tan(\\theta/2) = \\cos(\\theta/2) \\cdot \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\sin(\\theta/2)$.\n\n    Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:\n    $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n    The elements of the normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n\n7.  **Compare with Options**\n    The calculated elements of the eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
