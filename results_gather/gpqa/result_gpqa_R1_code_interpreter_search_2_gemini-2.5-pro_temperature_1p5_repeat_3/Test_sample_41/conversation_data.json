The key is to combine the formula for equilibrium temperature with Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:**\n    The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet orbiting a star is given by the formula:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\times (\\frac{R_{star}}{2a})^{1/2} \\times (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n    where:\n    *   $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n    *   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (the orbital distance for a circular orbit).\n    *   $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\n    In this problem, all three planets orbit the same star, so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are constant. We are also told that the albedo, $A$, is the same for all three planets (A = 0.3). Therefore, all terms except the orbital distance 'a' are constant. This simplifies the relationship to:\n    $T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$\n    This means that the square of the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the orbital distance:\n    $T_{eq}^2 \\propto \\frac{1}{a}$, or rearranging, $a \\propto \\frac{1}{T_{eq}^2}$.\n\n2.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law:**\n    Kepler's Third Law states the relationship between the orbital period ($P$) and the semi-major axis ($a$) of an orbiting body:\n    $P^2 \\propto a^3$\n    This is an excellent approximation when the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star's mass ($M_{planet} << M_{star}$), which is standard for exoplanet systems. The information about the planet masses and the TTV discovery method is likely included to test this understanding, but without the star's mass, we must proceed with this approximation.\n\n3.  **Combine the Two Relationships:**\n    We can combine the two proportionalities to find a direct relationship between the orbital period ($P$) and the equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$).\n    *   From step 1: $a \\propto \\frac{1}{T_{eq}^2}$\n    *   From step 2: $P^2 \\propto a^3$\n\n    Substitute the expression for 'a' into Kepler's law:\n    $P^2 \\propto (\\frac{1}{T_{eq}^2})^3 = \\frac{1}{T_{eq}^6}$\n    Taking the square root of both sides gives the final relationship:\n    $P \\propto \\frac{1}{T_{eq}^3}$\n    This shows that a planet's orbital period is inversely proportional to the cube of its equilibrium temperature.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Required Ratios:**\n    We want to find the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, which is the ratio $P_3 / P_1$.\n    Using the relationship from step 3:\n    $\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,3}})^3$\n\n    We need to find the temperature ratio $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,3}$.

    "The problem requires us to determine the ratio of the orbital periods of two exoplanets, Planet 3 and Planet 1, based on the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures. The solution involves combining the physics of planetary equilibrium temperature with Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion.\n\n### **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Identify Key Physical Principles:**\n    *   **Equilibrium Temperature ($T_{eq}$):** The temperature of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates away. For a planet in a circular orbit, this is given by:\n        $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n        where $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the star's temperature and radius, $a$ is the planet's orbital distance (semi-major axis), and $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law:** This law relates a planet's orbital period ($P$) to its semi-major axis ($a$). For planets orbiting the same star, where the planetary masses are negligible compared to the star's mass, the law simplifies to a direct proportionality:\n        $P^2 \\propto a^3$\n\n2.  **Establish a Relationship between Period and Temperature:**\n    *   First, let's analyze the equilibrium temperature formula for the planets in this specific system. Since all three planets orbit the same star, $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are constants. We are also explicitly told that the albedo, $A$, is the same for all three planets. This means the terms $T_{star}$, $R_{star}$, and $(1-A)$ are constant across the system. Therefore, the equilibrium temperature is only dependent on the orbital distance `a`:\n        $T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$ or $T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n    *   We can rearrange this to express the orbital distance `a` in terms of temperature:\n        $a \\propto \\frac{1}{T_{eq}^2}$\n    *   Now, we can substitute this relationship for `a` into Kepler's Third Law ($P^2 \\propto a^3$):\n        $P^2 \\propto \\left( \\frac{1}{T_{eq}^2} \\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{T_{eq}^6}$\n    *   Taking the square root of both sides gives us a powerful direct relationship between the orbital period and the equilibrium temperature:\n        $P \\propto \\frac{1}{T_{eq}^3}$\n    *   This shows that the orbital period is inversely proportional to the cube of the equilibrium temperature. The information about the planet masses and the TTV discovery method is extraneous, as the simplified form of Kepler's Law is sufficient and standard for this type of problem.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Final Ratio:**\n    *   We want to find the ratio $P_3 / P_1$. Using the relationship derived above:\n        $\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \\frac{1/T_{eq,3}^3}{1/T_{eq,1}^3} = \\left( \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,3}} \\right)^3$\n    *   We are given the temperature ratios between adjacent planets. Since temperature decreases with orbital distance (and period increases), a higher temperature ratio (e.g., $T_1/T_2 > 1$) implies Planet 1 is closer than Planet 2.\n        *   Given ratio between Planet 1 and Planet 2 is 1.4 $\\implies \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = 1.4$\n        *   Given ratio between Planet 2 and Planet 3 is 2.3 $\\implies \\frac{T_{eq,2}}{T_{eq,3}} = 2.3$\n    *   We can find the required ratio $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,3}$ by multiplying these two ratios:\n        $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,3}} = \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} \\times \\frac{T_{eq,2}}{T_{eq,3}} = 1.4 \\times 2.3 = 3.22$\n    *   Finally, we substitute this value back into our period ratio equation:\n        $\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (3.22)^3 \\approx 33.386$\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculation shows that the orbital period of Planet 3 is larger than that of Planet 1 by a factor of approximately 33.4. This matches option B.\n\nThe following Python code confirms the numerical calculation:\n```python\n# Given ratios from the problem description.\n# T1/T2 = 1.4 implies Planet 1 is hotter and thus closer than Planet 2.\n# T2/T3 = 2.3 implies Planet 2 is hotter and thus closer than Planet 3.\n# The order from the star is Planet 1, Planet 2, Planet 3.\nTeq1_over_Teq2 = 1.4\nTeq2_over_Teq3 = 2.3\n\n# We need the ratio T_eq,1 / T_eq,3 to find the period ratio P3 / P1.\nTeq1_over_Teq3 = Teq1_over_Teq2 * Teq2_over_Teq3\n\n# The relationship between period and temperature is P is proportional to 1/(T_eq^3).\n# Therefore, P3 / P1 = (T_eq,1 / T_eq,3)^3.\nperiod_ratio_P3_P1 = Teq1_over_Teq3 ** 3\n\nprint(f\"The calculated temperature ratio T1/T3 is: {Teq1_over_Teq3}\")\nprint(f\"The final period ratio P3/P1 is: {period_ratio_P3_P1}\")\n```\nThe output `The final period ratio P3/P1 is: 33.386248...` confirms that the factor is approximately 33.4.\n\n<<<B>>>",
