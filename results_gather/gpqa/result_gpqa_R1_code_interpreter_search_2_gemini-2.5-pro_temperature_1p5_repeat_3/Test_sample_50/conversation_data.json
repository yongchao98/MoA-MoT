    "This problem can be solved using the method of images. The grounded conducting sphere creates a potential V=0 on its surface. To replicate this boundary condition, we can replace the sphere with an \"image charge\" `q'` placed at a specific location inside the original sphere's volume.\n\n**1. Finding the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b)**\n\n*   Let the center of the sphere be the origin. The charge `q` is at a distance `d` from the origin. The sphere has a radius `R`.\n*   The method of images shows that to maintain a zero potential on the surface of the sphere, we can place an image charge `q'` at a distance `b` from the center, along the line connecting the center to `q`.\n*   The magnitude and position of this image charge are given by the standard formulas:\n    *   Position of the image charge: `b = R^2 / d`\n    *   Magnitude of the image charge: `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n\nThe image charge `q'` is placed at `b` and the real charge `q` is at `d`. The original sphere is now conceptually removed, and the field outside the original spherical volume is correctly described by these two point charges.\n\n**2. Calculating the Potential Energy**\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. This work is done against the force exerted by the induced charges on the sphere. In our image model, this is the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\nThe potential energy `U` of a system where the potential sources are induced by the charge itself is given by `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of `q` created by the induced charges (or, in our model, by the image charge).\n\n*   First, calculate the potential at position `d` (the location of `q`) due to the image charge `q'` (which is at position `b`). The distance between `q` and `q'` is `d - b`.\n    `V_image = k * q' / (d - b)`\n\n*   Substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n    `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n    `b = R^2 / d`\n    `d - b = d - (R^2 / d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\n*   Now substitute these into the potential expression:\n    `V_image = k * [ -q * (R / d) ] / [ (d^2 - R^2) / d ]`\n    `V_image = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n*   Finally, calculate the potential energy `U` using the formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_image`:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [ -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\n\nA) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2) - Incorrect.\nB) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect.\nC) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2) - Correct.\nD) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect.\n\nThe derived expression matches option C. The negative sign indicates that the force between the charge `q` and the grounded sphere is attractive.\n\n<<<C>>>"
