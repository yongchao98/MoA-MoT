    "In physics, \"regularization at high energies\" refers to a mathematical procedure used to handle infinities that arise in calculations, particularly in quantum field theories. These infinities, known as ultraviolet (UV) divergences, occur when integrals over high energies (or, equivalently, short distances) blow up.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n*   **A) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** This is the quantum theory of light and matter. When calculating physical quantities like the self-energy of an electron or scattering amplitudes using perturbation theory (Feynman diagrams), one encounters integrals that diverge at high energies. QED requires a procedure called **renormalization**, which starts with **regularization** (e.g., imposing a momentum cutoff) to make these integrals finite, and then absorbs the infinities into the definitions of fundamental constants like charge and mass. So, QED definitely requires regularization.\n\n*   **B) Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory, described by Maxwell's equations, also has a high-energy problem. The energy stored in the electric field of a point charge is infinite. If you calculate the energy E = ∫(ε₀/2)E² dV for a point charge, the integral diverges as you get closer to the charge (r → 0). This implies an infinite mass for the electron, which is nonsensical. This is a classical high-energy divergence that requires some form of regularization, such as assuming the electron is not a point but has a small, finite radius.\n\n*   **C) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** Much like QED, QCD is a quantum field theory (describing the strong force). It also suffers from ultraviolet divergences in its perturbative calculations and therefore requires regularization and renormalization to make physical predictions.\n\n*   **D) Superstring Theory:** One of the primary motivations for string theory is that it is believed to be a UV-finite theory. Unlike point particles in quantum field theory, strings are extended, one-dimensional objects. Their interactions are \"smeared out\" in spacetime. This smearing naturally smooths out the short-distance behavior that leads to high-energy divergences in point-particle theories. As a result, calculations in superstring theory are expected to be finite without the need for an *ad hoc* regularization procedure. It provides its own natural, physical regulator (the string length).\n\nTherefore, Superstring Theory is the theory among the choices that is constructed in a way that is expected to not require regularization at high energies.\n\n<<<D>>>"
