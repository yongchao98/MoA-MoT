    "*   **Step 1: Reaction of trans-cinnamaldehyde with methylmagnesium bromide**\n    *   **Reactants:**\n        *   *trans*-cinnamaldehyde (C₆H₅CH=CHCHO): This is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. It has a phenyl group (6 carbons), a vinyl group (2 carbons), and an aldehyde group (1 carbon), for a total of 9 carbon atoms.\n        *   Methylmagnesium bromide (CH₃MgBr): This is a Grignard reagent. The methyl group (CH₃) acts as a nucleophile.\n    *   **Reaction:** The Grignard reagent will perform a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde. This is a 1,2-addition reaction. The C=O double bond becomes a C-OH single bond (after an acidic workup, which is implied), and the methyl group from the Grignard reagent is added to the carbonyl carbon.\n    *   **Product 1:** The resulting product is 1-phenylbut-1-en-3-ol (C₆H₅CH=CHCH(OH)CH₃).\n    *   **Carbon Count:** We started with 9 carbons in cinnamaldehyde and added 1 carbon from the methylmagnesium bromide. So, Product 1 has 9 + 1 = 10 carbon atoms.\n\n*   **Step 2: Reaction of Product 1 with pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC)**\n    *   **Reactant:** Product 1 (1-phenylbut-1-en-3-ol), which is a secondary alcohol.\n    *   **Reagent:** Pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) is a mild oxidizing agent that converts secondary alcohols into ketones. It does not affect carbon-carbon double bonds.\n    *   **Reaction:** PCC oxidizes the hydroxyl (-OH) group of Product 1 into a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n    *   **Product 2:** The resulting product is 4-phenylbut-3-en-2-one (C₆H₅CH=CHC(=O)CH₃), also known as benzalacetone. This is an α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n    *   **Carbon Count:** This is an oxidation reaction; no carbon atoms are added or removed. Product 2 still has 10 carbon atoms.\n\n*   **Step 3: Reaction of Product 2 with (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane**\n    *   **Reactant:** Product 2 (4-phenylbut-3-en-2-one), an α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n    *   **Reagent:** (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane is the IUPAC name for dimethylsulfoxonium methylide, [(CH₃)₂S(O)CH₂]. This is a sulfur ylide known as the Corey-Chaykovsky reagent.\n    *   **Reaction:** The Corey-Chaykovsky reagent is a \"soft\" nucleophile and preferentially reacts with α,β-unsaturated ketones via conjugate addition (also known as Michael or 1,4-addition). The CH₂ group from the ylide attacks the β-carbon of the C=C double bond, leading to the formation of a cyclopropane ring across the former double bond.\n    *   **Product 3:** The CH₂ group from the ylide adds to the molecule, forming a three-membered ring. The product is 1-(2-phenylcyclopropyl)ethan-1-one.\n    *   **Carbon Count:** We started with Product 2, which has 10 carbon atoms. The Corey-Chaykovsky reagent adds one methylene (CH₂) group to the structure. Therefore, the final product has 10 + 1 = 11 carbon atoms.\n\nFinal check of the carbon count for Product 3, 1-(2-phenylcyclopropyl)ethan-1-one:\n*   Phenyl group (C₆H₅-): 6 carbons\n*   Cyclopropane ring (-C₃H₄-): 3 carbons\n*   Acetyl group (-C(=O)CH₃): 2 carbons\nThe structure shares carbons between these groups. Let's count atom by atom from the structure C₆H₅-CH(ring)-CH(ring)-C(=O)CH₃, with a CH₂ completing the ring.\n*   Phenyl group: 6 carbons\n*   Two carbons from the original C=C bond, now part of the ring: 2 carbons\n*   One carbon from the ylide, now part of the ring: 1 carbon\n*   Carbonyl carbon: 1 carbon\n*   Methyl carbon from the acetyl group: 1 carbon\nTotal = 6 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 11 carbons.\n\nThus, product 3 contains 11 carbon atoms.\n\n<<<A>>>"
