    "The problem asks for the equilibrium concentration of free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) in a solution prepared by dissolving 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n1.  **Define the Chemical Equilibrium:** The Ca-EDTA complex, denoted as $[CaY]^{2-}$ (where $Y^{4-}$ represents the fully deprotonated EDTA molecule), is in equilibrium with its constituent ions in solution. Since we start with the complex, the relevant reaction to consider is its dissociation:\n    $[CaY]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Use the Formation Constant (K_f):** The problem provides the formation constant, $K_f$ (also written as $K_{Ca-EDTA}$), which describes the formation of the complex:\n    $Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [CaY]^{2-}$\n    The equilibrium expression for formation is:\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[CaY]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE Table:** We use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to track the concentrations as the system reaches equilibrium. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n\n| Species          | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| ---------------- | ----------- | ---------- | --------------- |\n| $[CaY]^{2-}$      | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| $Ca^{2+}$        | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| $Y^{4-}$         | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n    The term \"ideal pH\" implies that we can use the given absolute formation constant directly, without needing to account for the protonation of EDTA. This means the pH is high enough (typically >10) that almost all unbound EDTA exists as $Y^{4-}$.\n\n4.  **Solve the Equilibrium Expression:** Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n    $K_f = \\frac{(0.02 - x)}{(x)(x)} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n5.  **Apply Simplification:** The formation constant $K_f$ is very large ($5 \\times 10^{10}$). This indicates that the equilibrium lies strongly to the left (favoring the complex), and very little dissociation will occur. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be extremely small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can make the simplifying assumption:\n    $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\n    The expression simplifies to:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n6.  **Calculate x:** Now, we solve for x, which represents the equilibrium concentration of $Ca^{2+}$.\n    $x^2 = \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x^2 = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x^2 = 0.4 \\times 10^{-12} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n    The concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. This value matches option D.\n\nWe can verify this with a short calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\nK_f = 5e10\ninitial_complex_conc = 0.02\n\n# Equation is K_f = (0.02 - x) / x^2\n# Simplified is K_f = 0.02 / x^2\n# So x^2 = 0.02 / K_f\nx_squared = initial_complex_conc / K_f\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\nprint(f\"{x:.2e}\")\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The user has confirmed the previous calculation was correct by providing the code output. I will now provide the final answer.\n\nThe reasoning is as follows:\n1.  **Reaction Setup:** The problem involves the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex, denoted as $[CaY]^{2-}$, into its constituent ions.\n    The equilibrium is: $[CaY]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n2.  **Equilibrium Constant:** The stability or formation constant ($K_f$) for the complex is given for the formation reaction:\n    $Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [CaY]^{2-}$\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[CaY]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n3.  **ICE Table:** We start with 0.02 M of the complex and assume it dissociates by an amount 'x'.\n    *   Initial: $[[CaY]^{2-}] = 0.02$ M, $[Ca^{2+}] = 0$, $[Y^{4-}] = 0$\n    *   Change: $[[CaY]^{2-}] = -x$, $[Ca^{2+}] = +x$, $[Y^{4-}] = +x$\n    *   Equilibrium: $[[CaY]^{2-}] = 0.02 - x$, $[Ca^{2+}] = x$, $[Y^{4-}] = x$\n4.  **Solving the Expression:** Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the $K_f$ expression:\n    $K_f = \\frac{(0.02 - x)}{(x)(x)} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n5.  **Simplification:** Because $K_f$ is very large, the dissociation will be minimal. Therefore, 'x' will be very small compared to 0.02 M, so we can approximate $(0.02 - x) \\approx 0.02$.\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n6.  **Calculation:** Solve for 'x', which is the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$.\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\nThis value corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
