    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting compound from the molecular formula (C8H9NO) and 1H-NMR data.**\n\n*   **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    DBE = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional double bond or ring (1 DBE).\n\n*   **Analyze the 1H-NMR spectrum:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This signal is in the characteristic region for an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) multiplicity indicates it is coupled to two adjacent protons (n=2, n+1=3 peaks), suggesting a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the two protons of the -CH2- group. The doublet (d) multiplicity confirms it is coupled to the single aldehyde proton (n=1, n+1=2 peaks). The chemical shift is appropriate for a methylene group attached to both an aromatic ring and an aldehyde group.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet is characteristic of the two protons of a primary amine group (-NH2). The broadness is due to rapid proton exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom.\n\n*   **Assemble the structure:**\n    We have the following fragments: a para-disubstituted benzene ring, an amino group (-NH2), and an acetaldehyde group (-CH2CHO). Assembling these pieces gives the structure **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4 (ring) + C2H3O (side chain) + NH2 = C8H9NO. The structure is consistent with all the data.\n\n**Step 2: Follow the reaction sequence.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde\n     \n\n*   **Reagents 1 & 2: 1. NaNO2 + HCl; 2. H2O**\n    1.  **Diazotization:** The primary aromatic amine (-NH2) reacts with nitrous acid (formed in situ from NaNO2 and HCl at low temperature) to form a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n    2.  **Hydrolysis:** The diazonium salt is unstable and, upon warming in water (H2O), the -N2+ group is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group, releasing N2 gas. This is a standard synthesis of a phenol.\n    *   **Product of Step 2:** The starting material is converted to **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n         \n\n*   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    This set of reagents promotes a **base-catalyzed aldol condensation**. 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde has both an aldehyde functional group and acidic α-protons (the protons on the -CH2- group), so it can react with itself.\n    1.  **Aldol Addition:** A hydroxide ion (from KOH) removes an α-proton from one molecule to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate then attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule. After protonation, this yields a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is the aldol adduct.\n        *   The adduct is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option A).\n    2.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** The presence of **heat** indicates that the reaction will not stop at the addition stage. The aldol adduct will undergo dehydration (elimination of a water molecule). The acidic proton on the α-carbon (C2) is removed, and the hydroxyl group on the β-carbon (C3) leaves. This forms a double bond between the α and β carbons.\n        *   The resulting product is an **α,β-unsaturated aldehyde**. The final structure is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This conjugated system is thermodynamically more stable, and its formation is favored by heat.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Final Product.**\n\nThe reaction sequence, especially with the application of heat in the final step, leads to the aldol condensation product, not just the aldol addition product.\n\n*   Initial Product: 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde\n*   After steps 1 & 2: 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde\n*   After step 3 (KOH, Heat): The final product is the dehydrated condensation product, **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\nLet's check this against the given options:\nA) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal - This is the aldol addition product, which forms before the heat-induced dehydration.\nB) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal - Incorrect structure and atom count.\nC) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal - This is the final, stable α,β-unsaturated product from the aldol condensation.\nD) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal - Incorrect substituents (-OH groups are missing) and incorrect position of the double bond.\n\nTherefore, the correct final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<C>>>"
