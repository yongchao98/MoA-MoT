    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. The broadness is due to the varying strengths of these hydrogen bonds.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) bond stretch in a carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not differentiate between the isomers.\n\n**2. Analyze the ¹H NMR Data**\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This means there are no protons attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C-H). All four options are saturated alkanoic acids, so they lack vinyl hydrogens. This information is consistent with all options.\n*   **A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This is a complex splitting pattern. For a signal to be a dtq, the corresponding proton must be coupled to three different, non-equivalent neighboring groups of protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), which causes a doublet splitting (n+1 = 2).\n    *   Two neighboring protons (n=2), which cause a triplet splitting (n+1 = 3).\n    *   Three neighboring protons (n=3), which cause a quartet splitting (n+1 = 4).\n*   **A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This is another complex splitting pattern. For a signal to be a dtt, the corresponding proton must be coupled to three different, non-equivalent neighboring groups of protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), which causes a doublet splitting (n+1 = 2).\n    *   Two neighboring protons (n=2), which cause a triplet splitting (n+1 = 3).\n    *   Another group of two neighboring protons (n=2), which causes a second triplet splitting (n+1 = 3).\n\nOur task is to find the structure that has protons exhibiting both of these specific splitting patterns. Let's analyze each option.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Candidate Structure**\n\n*   **A) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    ```\n         CH₃(a)\n          |\n    HOOC-CH₂(e)-CH(b)-CH(d)-CH₃(c)\n                       |\n                      CH₃(c) \n    ```\n    Let's look for protons coupled to three distinct neighbors.\n    *   **H(b):** Coupled to H(d) (1H), CH₂(e) (2H), and CH₃(a) (3H). This would result in a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches one signal.\n    *   **H(d):** Coupled to H(b) (1H) and the two equivalent CH₃(c) groups (6H). This would give a doublet of septets.\n    *   There is no proton in this molecule coupled to one H, two Hs, and another two Hs. Therefore, there is **no dtt** signal. So, A is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    ```\n         CH₃(c) CH₃(e)\n          |     |\n    HOOC-C(a)--C(d)--CH₂(f)--CH₃(g)\n         |\n        H(b)\n    ```\n    *   **H(d):** Coupled to H(b) (1H), CH₃(e) (3H), and CH₂(f) (2H). This would result in a **doublet of quartets of triplets (dqt)**. This matches the dtq signal.\n    *   Let's look for a dtt. No proton is coupled to two different CH₂ groups and a CH group. Therefore, there is **no dtt** signal. So, B is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    ```\n           Et    Et\n           |     |\n    HOOC--CH(a)--CH(b)--CH₂(c)--CH₃(d)\n    ```\n    Let's analyze the backbone protons. (Et = -CH₂CH₃)\n    *   **H(b):** Coupled to H(a) (1H), the attached ethyl group's CH₂ (2H), and the backbone's CH₂(c) (2H). This would result in a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one signal.\n    *   **H(a):** Coupled to H(b) (1H) and its attached ethyl group's CH₂ (2H). This would be a doublet of triplets (dt).\n    *   There is no proton coupled to 1H, 2H, and 3H. Therefore, there is **no dtq** signal. So, C is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    This formula describes the molecule 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid.\n    ```\n         Et(e)   Et(f)\n          |       |\n    HOOC-CH₂(a)-CH(b)-CH(c)-CH₃(d)\n    ```\n    Let's analyze the key backbone protons, H(b) and H(c).\n    *   **H(b) (at position 3):** This proton is coupled to:\n        *   The two protons of CH₂(a) (giving a **triplet**).\n        *   The one proton H(c) (giving a **doublet**).\n        *   The two protons of the attached ethyl group CH₂(e) (giving a **triplet**).\n        The resulting signal for H(b) is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the required signals.\n\n    *   **H(c) (at position 4):** This proton is coupled to:\n        *   The one proton H(b) (giving a **doublet**).\n        *   The two protons of the attached ethyl group CH₂(f) (giving a **triplet**).\n        *   The three protons of the terminal methyl group CH₃(d) (giving a **quartet**).\n        The resulting signal for H(c) is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the second required signal.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly structure D, 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, has protons that would produce both a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt) and a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq) in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>"
