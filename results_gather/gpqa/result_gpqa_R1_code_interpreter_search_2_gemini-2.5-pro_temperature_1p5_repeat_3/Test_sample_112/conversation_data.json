    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound's chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A **very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A **strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. The position around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is typical for the carbonyl group within a carboxylic acid.\n    *   A **strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to **vinyl-hydrogens** (hydrogens attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond) confirms the presence of an alkene functional group, which supports the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   A **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is a highly diagnostic fragment for a carboxylic acid. This mass corresponds to the [COOH]⁺ fragment ion (Mass of C = 12, Mass of O = 16, Mass of H = 1; Total = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45).\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information:**\n    *   The combined evidence from FTIR (broad O-H, C=O) and Mass Spectrometry (m/z=45) strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). This means the molecule must contain two oxygen atoms. This eliminates options **B) C6H12O** and **C) C6H10O**.\n    *   The evidence from FTIR (C=C stretch) and 1H NMR (vinyl hydrogens) confirms the presence of an alkene (C=C) functional group.\n\n5.  **Use the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    *   We now need to decide between the remaining options: **A) C6H10O2** and **D) C6H12O2**. We can do this by calculating the Degree of Unsaturation (also known as double bond equivalents) for each formula and comparing it to what we expect from the identified functional groups.\n    *   **Expected DBE:** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) contains one double bond (C=O), which accounts for one degree of unsaturation. The alkene group (C=C) contains one double bond, which accounts for a second degree of unsaturation. Therefore, the molecule must have a total DBE of 2.\n    *   The formula for DBE is: DBE = C + 1 - (H/2).\n    *   **Calculate DBE for A) C6H10O2:**\n        DBE = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2. This matches our expected DBE.\n    *   **Calculate DBE for D) C6H12O2:**\n        DBE = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1. This does not match our expected DBE, as it only accounts for the carboxylic acid and not the alkene.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only molecular formula that is consistent with all the provided spectral data (a carboxylic acid and an alkene) is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
