    "*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable. The most common reasons for chirality in organic molecules are the presence of a chiral center or axial chirality.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:\n    *   This is a biphenyl compound where the two phenyl rings are joined by a single bond.\n    *   The ortho positions (2, 6, 2', and 6') are all substituted with bulky groups: methyl carboxylate (-COOCH3) and nitro (-NO2) groups.\n    *   These bulky ortho substituents cause significant steric hindrance, which severely restricts the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings.\n    *   This restricted rotation locks the molecule into a non-planar conformation. Because the molecule is non-planar and lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, it is chiral. Its mirror image is non-superimposable.\n    *   This phenomenon is known as atropisomerism, which is a type of axial chirality. Therefore, this compound shows optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the carbon bonded to the -OH group). This carbon atom is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methyl carboxylate group (-COOCH3)\n    *   Since the carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center.\n    *   Molecules with a single chiral center are always chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**:\n    *   The structure is C6H5-CO-C6H5. It is a ketone with two phenyl groups attached to the carbonyl carbon.\n    *   The molecule does not contain any chiral centers. The central carbon is sp2 hybridized and bonded to only three groups.\n    *   The molecule possesses elements of symmetry. For instance, it has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond, making it achiral.\n    *   Achiral molecules do not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**:\n    *   This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the ester groups in a trans configuration about the C=C double bond.\n    *   The molecule is planar. All planar molecules have a plane of symmetry (the molecular plane itself) and are therefore achiral.\n    *   Furthermore, dimethyl fumarate has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the double bond.\n    *   Since it is an achiral molecule, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis, compound 1 (due to atropisomerism) and compound 2 (due to a chiral center) are chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and will not.\n\nTherefore, the correct option includes both 1 and 2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
