    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n### Reaction A:\n**Reactants:**\n*   **Michael Donor:** dimethyl malonate (CH₂(COOCH₃)₂)\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate (p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃)\n*   **Base/Solvent:** Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) in ethanol (EtOH)\n\n**Mechanism:**\n1.  **Enolate Formation:** The base NaOEt deprotonates the acidic α-carbon of dimethyl malonate, which is positioned between the two ester carbonyl groups.\n    `CH₂(COOMe)₂ + EtO⁻ ⇌ ⁻CH(COOMe)₂ + EtOH`\n    (Here, Me represents a methyl group, CH₃)\n2.  **Nucleophilic Attack (Michael Addition):** The resulting malonate enolate is a strong nucleophile. It attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated ester (the Michael acceptor). The β-carbon is the carbon atom attached to the p-tolyl group.\n    `Acceptor: p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOMe`\n    `Attack: ⁻CH(COOMe)₂ + p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOMe → p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOMe)₂) - CH⁻-COOMe`\n3.  **Protonation:** The intermediate enolate is protonated by the solvent (EtOH) to yield the final neutral product. The proton adds to the α-carbon.\n    `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOMe)₂) - CH⁻-COOMe + EtOH → p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOMe)₂) - CH₂-COOMe + EtO⁻`\n\n**Product A Structure and Name:**\nThe final product has the structure `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOMe)₂) - CH₂-COOMe`.\nTo name this systematically using the names provided in the options, we identify the main carbon chain. It can be viewed as a propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n*   The propane chain is C1-C2-C3.\n*   C1 comes from the malonate and has two methyl carboxylate groups: `-CH(COOMe)₂`.\n*   C2 is the former β-carbon of the acceptor. It is attached to C1, C3, a hydrogen, and the p-tolyl group: `-CH(p-tolyl)-`.\n*   C3 is the former α-carbon of the acceptor. It is attached to a methyl carboxylate group: `-CH₂(COOMe)`.\nCombining these pieces gives the structure: `(MeOOC)CH₂ - CH(p-tolyl) - CH(COOMe)₂`.\nThe IUPAC name for this structure is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n**Reactants:**\n*   **Michael Donor:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine (an enamine, formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine)\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN)\n*   **Reagents:** Methanol (MeOH) followed by aqueous acid workup (H₃O⁺)\n\n**Mechanism (Stork Enamine Alkylation):**\n1.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The enamine acts as an enol equivalent. The lone pair on the nitrogen pushes electron density into the double bond, making the α-carbon (relative to the original ketone) nucleophilic. This nucleophilic carbon attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n    `Acceptor: CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`\n    The attack results in a new C-C bond between the α-carbon of the cyclohexanone part and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. An iminium ion intermediate is formed.\n2.  **Hydrolysis:** The acidic workup (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back into a carbonyl group (ketone).\nThe final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the α-position (C2) with a group derived from the acceptor. The group is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n\n**Product B Structure and Name:**\nThe product is a cyclohexanone ring with a `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN` group at the C-2 position.\nTo name the product, we can treat the nitrile as the principal functional group.\n*   The parent chain is butanenitrile.\n*   At position 3 of the butanenitrile chain, there is a substituent.\n*   The substituent is the cyclohexanone ring, attached via its C2 position. The name of this substituent is `(2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\nTherefore, the name of Product B is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto form is the major stable product, not the enol tautomer.\n\n### Reaction C:\nThis is a \"retrosynthesis\" problem. We are given the product and one reactant (the Michael acceptor) and need to find the other reactant (the Michael donor, C).\n*   **Reactant (Michael Acceptor):** but-3-en-2-one (also known as methyl vinyl ketone or MVK, CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃).\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Catalyst:** KOH, H₂O\n\n**Mechanism (in reverse):**\n1.  **Analyze the Product:** The product is a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring substituted at `C2` with a `(3-oxobutyl)` group. The 3-oxobutyl group is `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`.\n2.  **Identify the new C-C bond:** The Michael addition connects the α-carbon of the donor to the β-carbon of the acceptor.\n    The acceptor is MVK: `CH₂(β)=CH(α)-CO-CH₃`. After the reaction (reduction of the double bond and protonation of the α-carbon), it becomes the `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃` group.\n    This group is attached to C2 of the cyclohexane-1,3-dione. Thus, the new bond is between C2 of the dione and the terminal CH₂ (the former β-carbon) of MVK.\n3.  **Identify the Donor (C):** This means the nucleophile was the enolate of `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`. The acidic protons are on the C2 methylene group, flanked by two carbonyls. The base (KOH) removes one of these protons to form the nucleophilic enolate.\nTherefore, the starting Michael donor (Reactant C) is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion:\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n*   A) Incorrect A, B, and C.\n*   B) Correct A and B, but incorrect C.\n*   C) Correct A, B, and C.\n*   D) Incorrect A and B.\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
