    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transition and States:**\n    The problem describes a two-step decay process for a hydrogen atom from the initial state |n,l,m> = |3,0,0> to the final state |1,0,0>. The decay occurs via electric dipole transitions. All options suggest that the intermediate state has a principal quantum number n=2.\n\n2.  **Apply Electric Dipole Selection Rules:**\n    For an electric dipole transition between an initial state |n,l,m> and a final state |n',l',m'>, the following selection rules must be obeyed:\n    *   Δl = l' - l = ±1\n    *   Δm = m' - m = 0, ±1\n    *   Δn can be any integer.\n\n3.  **Determine the Path of the First Transition:**\n    *   Initial state: |3,0,0> (l=0, m=0).\n    *   According to the selection rule Δl = ±1, the orbital quantum number must change by 1. Since l=0, the intermediate state must have l' = 1.\n    *   The problem specifies the intermediate state has n'=2.\n    *   According to the selection rule Δm = 0, ±1, the magnetic quantum number m can change to m' = m + Δm = 0 + Δm. Thus, the possible values for m' are -1, 0, and +1.\n    *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>. This is the 2p subshell.\n\n4.  **Determine the Path of the Second Transition:**\n    *   Intermediate state: |2,1,m'> (l'=1).\n    *   Final state: |1,0,0> (l''=0, m''=0).\n    *   Let's check the selection rules for the transition from |2,1,m'> to |1,0,0>:\n        *   Δl = l'' - l' = 0 - 1 = -1. This is allowed.\n        *   Δm = m'' - m' = 0 - m'.\n            *   If m'=-1, Δm = +1 (allowed).\n            *   If m'=0, Δm = 0 (allowed).\n            *   If m'=1, Δm = -1 (allowed).\n    *   Thus, all three possible intermediate states can decay to the final state |1,0,0>. The possible routes are:\n        *   |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0>\n        *   |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>\n        *   |3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0>\n\n5.  **Calculate the Probabilities (Branching Ratios):**\n    The question asks for the probability of a specific route. This is the product of the branching ratios of the two steps.\n    *   **Probability = P(Step 1) × P(Step 2)**\n\n    *   **Step 1: Branching Ratio for |3,0,0> → |2,1,m'>**\n        The initial state |3,0,0> (3s state) is spherically symmetric (l=0). The decay process, spontaneous emission, is isotropic, meaning it has no preferred direction in space. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the possible final magnetic sublevels m'. Since there are three possible m' states (-1, 0, 1), the probability of transitioning into any single one of them is the same.\n        *   Total possible final states for the first step = 3.\n        *   Probability of transitioning to |2,1,-1> = 1/3.\n        *   Probability of transitioning to |2,1,0> = 1/3.\n        *   Probability of transitioning to |2,1,1> = 1/3.\n        So, P(Step 1) = 1/3 for any of the three paths.\n\n    *   **Step 2: Branching Ratio for |2,1,m'> → |1,0,0>**\n        Once the atom is in one of the |2,1,m'> states (2p states), it will decay to a lower energy state. The only available lower energy state accessible via a single dipole transition is the |1,0,0> state (1s state), as it is the only state with n<2 and Δl = -1. Any transition to a different state would either violate selection rules or require absorbing energy. Therefore, the probability of an atom in the 2p level decaying to the 1s level is 1 (or 100%).\n        *   P(Step 2) = 1.\n\n    *   **Total Probability:**\n        The total probability for any of the specific cascade routes is:\n        Probability = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3.\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    Let's check which option matches our findings. We are looking for a valid route with a calculated probability of 1/3.\n\n    *   A) Route |3,0,0>→|2,1,-1>→|1,0,0> is valid, but the probability is given as 1/4, which is incorrect.\n    *   B) The route |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0> is valid, but the probability is given as 2/3, which is incorrect.\n    *   C) The route |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0> is valid, and the probability is given as 1/3, which matches our calculation.\n    *   D) The route |3,0,0>→|2,1,1>→|1,0,0> is valid, but the probability is given as 1/4, which is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
