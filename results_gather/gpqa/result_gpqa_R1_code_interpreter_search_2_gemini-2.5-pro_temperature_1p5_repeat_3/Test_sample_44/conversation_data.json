    "*   **Understanding the System**\n    1.  **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin (like spin-1/2) are called fermions.\n    2.  **Governing Principle:** Identical fermions obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. For electrons or other spin-1/2 particles in a potential well, a quantum state is defined by the energy level (principal quantum number *n*) and the spin orientation (spin quantum number *m_s*, which can be spin-up or spin-down). This means each energy level *n* can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n    3.  **Potential Well:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L.\n    4.  **Energy Levels:** The quantized energy levels for a single particle in this well are given by the formula:\n        $E_n = n^2 \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\n        where *n* is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n    5.  **Energy Unit:** The problem defines a base energy unit $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. So, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed simply as $E_n = n^2 E$.\n\n*   **Calculation of State Energies**\n\n    We need to find the total energy of the 4-particle system for its three lowest energy configurations (ground state, first excited state, and second excited state) by filling the single-particle energy levels according to the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n    *   **Ground State Energy (E_GS)**\n        To achieve the lowest possible total energy (the ground state), we must fill the energy levels from the bottom up.\n        1.  **n = 1 level (Energy $E_1 = 1^2E = E$):** We place the first two particles here (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n        2.  **n = 2 level (Energy $E_2 = 2^2E = 4E$):** We place the remaining two particles here (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n        All four particles are now in the lowest possible energy states.\n        The total ground state energy is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n        $E_{GS} = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) = (2 \\times E) + (2 \\times 4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E$.\n\n    *   **First Excited State Energy (E_1st)**\n        To get the first excited state, we must create the lowest-energy excitation possible from the ground state. This involves moving one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n        1.  **Ground state configuration:** 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=2.\n        2.  **Excitation:** Move one particle from the n=2 level to the next available level, which is n=3 (Energy $E_3 = 3^2E = 9E$).\n        3.  **New configuration:** 2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, and 1 particle in n=3.\n        The total energy of the first excited state is:\n        $E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$.\n\n    *   **Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)**\n        The second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest total energy above the first excited state. We must consider different possible excitations from the ground state and find the one with the second-lowest excitation energy.\n        -   **Possibility 1: Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3.**\n            -   Configuration: 1 particle in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3.\n            -   Energy: $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (1 \\times E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n        -   **Possibility 2: Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3.**\n            -   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=3.\n            -   Energy: $(2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times E) + (2 \\times 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E$.\n        -   **Possibility 3: Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4.**\n            -   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4.\n            -   Energy: $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_4) = (2 \\times E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n\n        Comparing the possible excited state energies (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E...), the lowest is 15E (the first excited state) and the next lowest is 18E.\n        Therefore, the energy of the second excited state is $E_{2nd} = 18E$.\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n    -   Ground State Energy = **10E**\n    -   First Excited State Energy = **15E**\n    -   Second Excited State Energy = **18E**\n\n    This sequence of energies matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
