    "This problem involves a two-step calculation: first, determining the pH at 25% titration, which corresponds to a buffer region, and second, finding the pH at the equivalence point, where the weak acid has been completely converted to its conjugate base.\n\n**Step 1: Dilution of Acetic Acid**\n\nFirst, we calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted with water.\n*   Initial volume of acetic acid, V1 = 20.00 cm³\n*   Initial concentration of acetic acid, M1 = 0.05 M\n*   Final volume after adding water, V2 = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³\n*   Using the dilution formula M1V1 = M2V2:\n    (0.05 M) * (20.00 cm³) = M2 * (40.00 cm³)\n    M2 = (0.05 * 20.00) / 40.00 = 0.025 M\n*   So, the concentration of the acetic acid (HA) solution being titrated is 0.025 M.\n\n**Step 2: pH at 25% Titration**\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH to form its conjugate base, sodium acetate (A⁻), and 75% of the acetic acid remains. This creates a buffer solution.\nThe reaction is: `CH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COO⁻Na⁺ + H₂O`\n*   The ratio of the conjugate base to the weak acid is [A⁻]/[HA] = 25% / 75% = 1/3.\n*   We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH:\n    pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n*   First, we calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   Now, substitute the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n    pH = 4.733 - log(3)\n    pH = 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256\n\nSo, the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26.\n\n**Step 3: pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid (HA) has been converted into its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻). We need to calculate the pH of this weak base solution.\n\n1.  **Calculate the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point (V_eq):**\n    *   Moles of acid = M_acid * V_acid = 0.025 M * 0.040 L = 0.001 moles\n    *   At equivalence, moles of acid = moles of base.\n    *   moles of base = M_base * V_eq\n    *   0.001 moles = 0.1 M * V_eq\n    *   V_eq = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³\n\n2.  **Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion (A⁻) at the equivalence point:**\n    *   The moles of A⁻ formed are equal to the initial moles of HA, which is 0.001 moles.\n    *   The total volume of the solution is the initial volume of the acid plus the volume of NaOH added:\n        V_total = V_acid + V_eq = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n    *   Concentration of A⁻, [A⁻] = moles / V_total = 0.001 moles / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n\n3.  **Calculate the pH of the weak base (A⁻) solution:**\n    *   The acetate ion reacts with water in an equilibrium: A⁻ + H₂O ⇌ HA + OH⁻\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate. We can find it using the ion product of water (Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) and the Ka of acetic acid:\n        Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n    *   Now we set up an ICE table for the hydrolysis of acetate, where 'x' is the concentration of OH⁻ at equilibrium:\n        Kb = [HA][OH⁻] / [A⁻] = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    *   Since Kb is very small, we can assume that 'x' is much smaller than 0.02, so (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n        5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ ≈ x² / 0.02\n        x² ≈ (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02 ≈ 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n        x = [OH⁻] ≈ √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n    *   Now calculate the pOH:\n        pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    *   Finally, calculate the pH:\n        pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52\n\nSo, the pH at the equivalence point is 8.52.\n\nCombining the results, the pH at 25% titration is 4.26, and at the equivalence point, it is 8.52.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\n\n# --- Calculation for 25% Titration ---\n# At 25% titration, the ratio [A-]/[HA] is 0.25/0.75 = 1/3\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\npH_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\n# --- Calculation for Equivalence Point ---\n# 1. Initial concentration of diluted acid\nM_acid_diluted = 0.025  # mol/L\nV_acid_diluted = 0.040  # L\n\n# 2. Moles of acid\nmoles_acid = M_acid_diluted * V_acid_diluted\n\n# 3. Volume of base to reach equivalence\nM_base = 0.1 # mol/L\nV_base_eq = moles_acid / M_base\n\n# 4. Total volume at equivalence\nV_total_eq = V_acid_diluted + V_base_eq\n\n# 5. Concentration of conjugate base [A-] at equivalence\nmoles_A_minus = moles_acid\nconc_A_minus = moles_A_minus / V_total_eq\n\n# 6. Calculate Kb\nKb = Kw / Ka\n\n# 7. Calculate [OH-] from the hydrolysis of A-\n# Kb = [OH-]^2 / [A-]  (approximating [A-] - x ≈ [A-])\nconc_OH_minus = math.sqrt(Kb * conc_A_minus)\n\n# 8. Calculate pOH and then pH\npOH = -math.log10(conc_OH_minus)\npH_at_equivalence = 14.0 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_at_equivalence:.2f}\")\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
