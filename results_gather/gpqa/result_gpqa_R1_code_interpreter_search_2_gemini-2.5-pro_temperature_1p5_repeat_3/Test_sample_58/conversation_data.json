    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the pH of the final solution.\n\n**1. Calculate the initial moles of each substance.**\nThe number of moles is calculated by multiplying the molarity (M) by the volume in liters (L).\n\n*   **CH3COOH (Acetic Acid - a weak acid):**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Moles = 0.1 M * 0.500 L = 0.050 mol\n\n*   **HCl (Hydrochloric Acid - a strong acid):**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Moles = 0.2 M * 0.400 L = 0.080 mol\n    *   Since HCl is a strong acid, it completely dissociates, so moles of H+ = 0.080 mol.\n\n*   **Ba(OH)2 (Barium Hydroxide - a strong base):**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Moles = 0.3 M * 0.300 L = 0.090 mol\n    *   Since Ba(OH)2 is a strong base that releases two hydroxide ions per formula unit (Ba(OH)2 -> Ba2+ + 2OH-), the moles of OH- are:\n    *   Moles of OH- = 2 * 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol.\n\n**2. Perform the neutralization reactions.**\nThe first reaction is between the strong acid (H+ from HCl) and the strong base (OH- from Ba(OH)2).\n\n*   Moles of H+ = 0.080 mol\n*   Moles of OH- = 0.180 mol\n\nThe H+ ions will react with the OH- ions in a 1:1 ratio. Since there are more moles of OH- than H+, the H+ is the limiting reactant.\n\n*   Moles of OH- remaining = Moles of initial OH- - Moles of H+\n*   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol\n\nNow, the remaining strong base (0.100 mol of OH-) will react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n\n*   Moles of CH3COOH = 0.050 mol\n*   Moles of OH- available = 0.100 mol\n\nThe OH- ions will react with CH3COOH in a 1:1 ratio (CH3COOH + OH- -> CH3COO- + H2O). Since there are more moles of OH- than CH3COOH, the weak acid is the limiting reactant.\n\n*   Moles of OH- in excess = Moles of OH- available - Moles of CH3COOH\n*   Moles of OH- in excess = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol\n\n**3. Analyze the final solution and calculate the pH.**\nAfter all reactions, the solution contains:\n*   Excess OH- (a strong base) = 0.050 mol\n*   CH3COO- (acetate, a weak base) formed from the reaction = 0.050 mol\n*   Water and spectator ions (Cl-, Ba2+).\n\nThe pH of the solution is primarily determined by the concentration of the excess strong base (OH-), as its contribution will be far greater than that of the weak base (CH3COO-).\n\nFirst, calculate the total volume of the solution:\n*   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.200 L\n\nNext, calculate the final concentration of OH-:\n*   [OH-] = Moles of excess OH- / Total Volume\n*   [OH-] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L = 0.04167 M\n\nNow, calculate the pOH:\n*   pOH = -log[OH-]\n*   pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\nFinally, calculate the pH using the relationship pH + pOH = 14:\n*   pH = 14 - pOH\n*   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nTo confirm the exact calculation:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Moles of excess OH-\nmoles_oh_excess = 0.050\n\n# Total volume in Liters\ntotal_volume_L = 1.200\n\n# Concentration of OH-\nconc_oh = moles_oh_excess / total_volume_L\n\n# Calculate pOH and pH\npOH = -math.log10(conc_oh)\npH = 14 - pOH\n\nprint(f'{pH=:.2f}')\n```\n```output\npH=12.62\n```\n\nThe calculated pH is 12.62.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem involves mixing a weak acid (CH3COOH), a strong acid (HCl), and a strong base (Ba(OH)2). The final pH of the solution is determined by the substance that is in excess after all neutralization reactions have occurred.\n\n**1. Calculate the initial moles of acids and bases.**\nWe need to calculate the number of moles of H+ ions from the acids and OH- ions from the base.\n\n*   **Moles of CH3COOH (weak acid):**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = **0.050 mol CH3COOH**\n\n*   **Moles of H+ from HCl (strong acid):**\n    *   HCl is a strong acid, so it completely dissociates (HCl → H+ + Cl-).\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = **0.080 mol H+**\n\n*   **Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 (strong base):**\n    *   Ba(OH)2 is a strong base that dissociates completely (Ba(OH)2 → Ba2+ + 2OH-), producing two moles of OH- for every mole of Ba(OH)2.\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.090 mol Ba(OH)2\n    *   Moles of OH- = 2 × 0.090 mol = **0.180 mol OH-**\n\n**2. Perform neutralization reactions.**\nFirst, the strong acid (H+ from HCl) will react with the strong base (OH- from Ba(OH)2).\n\n*   Initial moles of H+ (strong) = 0.080 mol\n*   Initial moles of OH- (strong) = 0.180 mol\n*   Reaction: H+ + OH- → H2O\n*   Since there are fewer moles of H+, it is the limiting reactant. All 0.080 mol of H+ will be neutralized.\n*   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = **0.100 mol OH-**\n\nNext, the remaining strong base (OH-) will react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n\n*   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.100 mol\n*   Moles of CH3COOH = 0.050 mol\n*   Reaction: CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O\n*   The weak acid is the limiting reactant in this step. All 0.050 mol of CH3COOH will be neutralized.\n*   Moles of OH- in excess = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = **0.050 mol OH-**\n\n**3. Calculate the final pH.**\nThe final solution contains 0.050 moles of excess OH- (a strong base), making the solution basic. The pH is determined by the concentration of this excess OH-.\n\n*   First, calculate the total volume of the solution:\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.200 L\n\n*   Next, calculate the concentration of the excess OH-:\n    *   [OH-] = Moles of excess OH- / Total Volume\n    *   [OH-] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n*   Now, calculate the pOH:\n    *   pOH = -log[OH-]\n    *   pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   Finally, calculate the pH using the relationship pH + pOH = 14 (at 25°C):\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\nThe final pH of the solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<B>>>"
