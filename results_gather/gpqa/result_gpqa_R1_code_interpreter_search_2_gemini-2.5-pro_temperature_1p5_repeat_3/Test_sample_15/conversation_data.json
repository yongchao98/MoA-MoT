    "A molecule is optically active if it is chiral and not present as a racemic mixture (an equal mixture of both enantiomers). A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality are the presence of one or more stereocenters (chiral centers) and the absence of any internal planes of symmetry or centers of inversion. A molecule that has stereocenters but is achiral due to internal symmetry is called a meso compound.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`.\n    *   This is an alkene. The atoms involved in the C=C double bond and the atoms directly attached to them (`Cl`, `H`, `CH3`, and the first `CH2` of the ethyl group) lie in the same plane. The entire molecule is essentially planar.\n    *   Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself), making it achiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   The name includes absolute configuration descriptors: `(3aR,7aS,E)`. This specifies a single, specific stereoisomer of a molecule with multiple chiral centers (at positions 3a and 7a) and a chiral double bond (E-configuration at the chloromethylene group).\n    *   When a specific enantiomer of a chiral molecule is isolated, it is by definition optically active. The complex, unsymmetrical structure makes it highly unlikely to be a meso compound.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two chiral centers at C-2 and C-3.\n    *   Let's analyze the `(2R,3S)` stereoisomer. We can draw a Fischer projection. A molecule with two chiral centers and identical substituents at each end (`-COOH` at both ends, `-CH3` and `-H` on the chiral carbons) can have a meso form. The `(R,S)` combination is the meso form.\n    *   We can see a plane of symmetry between C-2 and C-3. If we draw the molecule in a staggered conformation and look down the C2-C3 bond, we can find a conformation that has a center of inversion, or in its eclipsed conformation (as represented by the Fischer projection), a plane of symmetry.\n    *      COOH\n    *       |\n    *   H -|- CH3   (C2-S configuration shown - let's correct this)\n    *\n    *   Correct Fischer for `(2R,3S)`:\n    *      COOH\n    *       |\n    * CH3-|- H     (C2-R)\n    *      |\n    *   H -|- CH3   (C3-S)\n    *      |\n    *     COOH\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry cutting horizontally through the C2-C3 bond. The top half is the mirror image of the bottom half.\n    *   This is a meso compound, which is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. The `(2R,3R)` and `(2S,3S)` isomers are a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   Drawing the Fischer projection for `(2R,3R)`:\n    *      COOH\n    *       |\n    * CH3-|- H     (C2-R)\n    *      |\n    * CH3-|- H     (C3-R)\n    *      |\n    *     COOH\n    *   This molecule does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer, and they are not superimposable.\n    *   Since `(2R,3R)`-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is a chiral molecule, a pure sample of this single enantiomer is optically active.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond (C3=C4) and an alcohol group at C1.\n    *   The carbon at position 1 is a chiral center, as it is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, -CH2-CH=, and =CH-CH2-.\n    *   The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer. A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is always optically active. The molecule lacks any plane of symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This compound has three hydroxyl groups on a cyclohexane ring at positions 1, 3, and 5. The descriptor `(1s,3s,5s)` or simply `cis` indicates that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring.\n    *   In a chair conformation, this corresponds to either all three -OH groups being axial or all three being equatorial.\n    *   This highly symmetrical molecule has multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane passing through one C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group bisects the molecule into two identical halves.\n    *   Due to the presence of these planes of symmetry, the molecule is achiral, despite the presence of prochiral centers at C1, C3, and C5.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure is (cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)2.\n    *   Let's check for any chiral centers (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n    *   The carbonyl carbon is sp2 hybridized.\n    *   The cyclopentyl ring has no chiral centers.\n    *   In the 3-methylbutyl chain (`-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)2`), none of the carbons are chiral. The carbon at position 3 is bonded to a -CH2- group, an H, and two identical -CH3 groups.\n    *   Since there are no chiral centers and the molecule does not possess any other type of chirality (like axial or planar chirality), it is achiral. It can adopt conformations that have a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically inactive**.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive (meso)\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive (achiral)\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive (achiral)\n\nThe number of optically active compounds is 3.\n\n<<<C>>>"
