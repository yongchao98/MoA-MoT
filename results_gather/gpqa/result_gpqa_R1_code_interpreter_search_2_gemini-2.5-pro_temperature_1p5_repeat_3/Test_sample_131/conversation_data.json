    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the provided information**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   Aromatic region (~6.7 ppm): Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   Aliphatic region (~2.2 ppm): Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Candidate Compounds:**\n    1.  1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)\n    2.  1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)\n    3.  1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)\n    4.  1,4-diethylbenzene\n\n**Step 2: Verify the molecular formula**\n\n*   All tetramethylbenzene isomers (C6H2(CH3)4) have the formula C10H14.\n*   1,4-diethylbenzene (C6H4(C2H5)2) also has the formula C10H14.\n*   All four compounds fit the molecular formula requirement.\n\n**Step 3: Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each individual compound**\n\nTo solve this, we must determine the number of chemically non-equivalent protons in each molecule, which will correspond to the number of signals in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet** for 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups are all equivalent due to symmetry. They produce **one singlet** for 12H.\n    *   *Spectrum Summary: 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).*\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet** for 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The methyl groups at C1/C4 are equivalent, and the methyl groups at C2/C3 are equivalent. This gives two distinct sets of methyl groups. They produce **two singlets**, each integrating to 6H.\n    *   *Spectrum Summary: 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 aliphatic singlets (6H, 6H).*\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 positions.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet** for 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3 (equivalent), the one at C2 (unique), and the one at C5 (unique). They produce **three singlets** with integrations of 6H, 3H, and 3H, respectively.\n    *   *Spectrum Summary: 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 3 aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).*\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are all equivalent. They produce **one singlet** for 4H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The protons on the two ethyl groups will show spin-spin splitting. The two -CH2- groups are equivalent and will be a **quartet** (4H). The two -CH3 groups are equivalent and will be a **triplet** (6H).\n    *   *Spectrum Summary: 1 aromatic singlet (4H), 1 aliphatic quartet (4H), 1 aliphatic triplet (6H).*\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the spectrum of the 1:1 mixture**\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:** The spectrum shows two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   This indicates the two compounds in the mixture each have an aromatic singlet, and the number of protons contributing to each singlet is equal.\n    *   All three tetramethylbenzene isomers produce a 2H singlet. Any pair of them would result in two 2H singlets (a 1:1 ratio), assuming their chemical shifts are different.\n    *   A mixture with 1,4-diethylbenzene (4H singlet) and any tetramethylbenzene (2H singlet) would produce a 2:1 integration ratio in the aromatic region, which contradicts the data. Furthermore, 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce only singlets in the aliphatic region.\n    *   Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene is not in the mixture**, and option A is eliminated. The mixture must consist of two of the three tetramethylbenzene isomers.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region:** The spectrum shows three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n    *   Since it is a 1:1 mixture of two C10H14 isomers, the total number of aliphatic (methyl) protons is 12 + 12 = 24H.\n    *   We can calculate the number of protons corresponding to each signal from the ratio:\n        *   Signal 1: (2 / (2+1+1)) * 24H = (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n        *   Signal 2: (1 / (2+1+1)) * 24H = (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n        *   Signal 3: (1 / (2+1+1)) * 24H = (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   So, we need a pair of isomers that, when combined, give a set of aliphatic signals corresponding to {12H, 6H, 6H}.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the remaining options**\n\nLet's check which pair of tetramethylbenzenes produces this specific set of aliphatic signals.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB provides one 12H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB provides three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   Combined Signals: {12H, 6H, 3H, 3H}. This is four signals, not three. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB:**\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB provides two 6H singlets.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB provides three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n    *   Combined Signals: {6H, 6H, 6H, 3H, 3H}. This would result in up to five signals, which requires significant and unlikely overlap to reduce to three signals with the correct ratio. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,4-TMB:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB (Durene) provides **one 12H singlet**.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB (Prehnitene) provides **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   Combined Signals: {12H, 6H, 6H}.\n    *   This combination gives exactly three singlets with an integration ratio of 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe mixture contains 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<D>>>"
