    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Br2 → Product 1**\nThis is the alpha-bromination of a ketone. Cyclohexanone reacts with bromine to form 2-bromocyclohexanone. The bromine atom attaches to one of the alpha-carbons (the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group). Since the two alpha-carbons in cyclohexanone are equivalent, only one product is formed.\n*   **Product 1: 2-bromocyclohexanone**\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) + NaOH (heat) → Product 2**\nThis reaction involves an α-halo ketone treated with a strong base (NaOH) and heat. The reactant, 2-bromocyclohexanone, has protons on the other alpha-carbon (C6, the α' position). These conditions are characteristic of the **Favorskii rearrangement**.\nThe mechanism involves:\n1.  Deprotonation at the α' position (C6) by the hydroxide ion.\n2.  The resulting enolate attacks the carbon bearing the bromine (C2) in an intramolecular S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction, forming a strained bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one intermediate.\n3.  The hydroxide ion attacks the carbonyl carbon, and the resulting intermediate undergoes ring-opening to relieve strain.\n4.  This process results in a ring contraction. The six-membered ring becomes a five-membered ring with a carboxylic acid group.\nAfter neutralization/workup, the product is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid. An E2 elimination to form cyclohex-2-enone is less favored under these conditions.\n*   **Product 2: Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) + SOCl2, pyridine → Product 3**\nThionyl chloride (SOCl<sub>2</sub>) is a standard reagent for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. Pyridine is used as a base to neutralize the HCl byproduct generated during the reaction.\n*   **Product 3: Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)<sub>3</sub>) → Product 4**\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a sterically hindered and mild reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to the primary alcohol. A stronger reducing agent like LiAlH<sub>4</sub> would reduce it all the way to the alcohol. The bulkiness and reduced reactivity of LiAlH(OtBu)<sub>3</sub> allow the reaction to be stopped at the aldehyde stage.\n*   **Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde (C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>9</sub>CHO). This corresponds to the number of signals expected in its <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum.\n\nThe structure is a cyclopentane ring attached to a formyl group (-CHO).\n1.  The carbon of the ring attached to the CHO group (C1) is a chiral center. It is bonded to four different groups: H, the CHO group, C2 of the ring, and C5 of the ring.\n2.  At room temperature, the cyclopentane ring undergoes rapid pseudorotation. This results in a time-averaged structure where some protons become equivalent on the NMR timescale.\n3.  The time-averaged structure has an effective plane of symmetry that passes through the C1-H bond, the CHO group, and bisects the C3-C4 bond. This makes C2 equivalent to C5, and C3 equivalent to C4.\n\nLet's count the sets of chemically distinct hydrogens based on this symmetry:\n*   **Signal 1**: The aldehyde proton (**H**-CHO). It is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type of H)\n*   **Signal 2**: The methine proton on C1 (the carbon attached to the CHO group). This proton is also in a unique environment. (1 type of H)\n*   **Signals 3 & 4**: The protons on C2 and C5. These two carbons are equivalent due to the time-averaged symmetry. However, the two protons on C2 are diastereotopic because they are on a carbon adjacent to a chiral center (C1). Therefore, they are chemically non-equivalent. The same applies to the protons on C5. The \"cis\" proton on C2 is equivalent to the \"cis\" proton on C5, and the \"trans\" proton on C2 is equivalent to the \"trans\" proton on C5. This gives two distinct signals from the four protons on C2 and C5. (2 types of H)\n*   **Signals 5 & 6**: The protons on C3 and C4. These two carbons are also equivalent due to symmetry. Similar to the C2/C5 case, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic (due to the influence of the chiral center at C1). This also results in two distinct signals from the four protons on C3 and C4. (2 types of H)\n\nTotal number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **6**.\n\nThe six types of chemically distinct hydrogens are:\n1.  Aldehyde H (1H)\n2.  C1-H (1H)\n3.  C2/C5 protons, set A (2H)\n4.  C2/C5 protons, set B (2H)\n5.  C3/C4 protons, set C (2H)\n6.  C3/C4 protons, set D (2H)\n\nThe total count matches the 10 hydrogens in the molecule.\n\nFinal Answer: There are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
