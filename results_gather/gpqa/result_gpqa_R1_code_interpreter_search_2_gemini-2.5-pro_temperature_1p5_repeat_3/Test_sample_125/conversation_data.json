    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of peaks in each chromatogram.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction I**\n\n1.  **Reactant and Reaction:** The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral ketone with a single stereocenter at the C5 position. It is treated with lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, which reduces the ketone group at C3 to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n2.  **Product and Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the planar carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. The hydride can attack from either face of the carbonyl, leading to two possible configurations at C3: (R) or (S). The original stereocenter at C5 remains unchanged ((S) configuration).\n3.  **Outcome of Reaction I:** The products are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two molecules are diastereomers because they have one stereocenter that is the same (C5) and one that is different (C3).\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction II**\n\n1.  **Reactant and Reaction:** The starting material is pentane-2,4-dione, which is an achiral molecule. It is treated with excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4), which reduces both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups.\n2.  **Product and Stereochemistry:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol. The reduction of the two ketone groups at C2 and C4 creates two new stereocenters. We need to consider all possible stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n3.  **Isomer Analysis:**\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are enantiomers of each other.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) isomer possesses an internal plane of symmetry, which makes it an achiral meso compound. The (2S, 4R) configuration describes the same meso compound.\n4.  **Outcome of Reaction II:** Since the starting material and the reagent are achiral, the reaction produces the achiral meso compound and an equal (racemic) mixture of the two enantiomers, (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S).\n\n### **Analysis of the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\nThe products from both reactions are combined. The mixture contains five distinct stereoisomers:\n*   From Reaction I: Two diastereomers, (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   From Reaction II: A pair of enantiomers, (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, plus the meso-pentane-2,4-diol.\n\n**1. Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers**, like the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) diols, have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated and will elute as a **single peak**.\n*   **Diastereomers**, however, have different physical properties and can be separated.\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I ((3R, 5S) and (3S, 5S)) will be separated, giving **2 peaks**.\n    *   The meso-diol from Reaction II is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. Thus, it will be separated from the enantiomers' peak, giving **1 peak**. The enantiomeric pair itself gives **1 peak**. So, the products from Reaction II yield 2 peaks in total on a normal-phase column.\n*   The products of Reaction I (C7 compounds) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (C5 compounds) and will have different retention times.\n*   **Total Peaks:** 2 peaks (from Reaction I) + 2 peaks (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC.\n\n**2. Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase, which allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n*   The column can separate all stereoisomers because they will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n*   The mixture contains five unique stereoisomers:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (diastereomer of 1)\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (enantiomer of 3)\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (diastereomer of 3 and 4)\n*   Since all five are distinct stereoisomers and a chiral column is designed to resolve them, we expect to see **5 peaks**, assuming no accidental co-elution.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
