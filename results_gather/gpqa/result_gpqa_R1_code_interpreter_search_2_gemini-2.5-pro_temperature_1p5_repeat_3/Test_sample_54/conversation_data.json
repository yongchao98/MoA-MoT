    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound from the given 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Analyze the Number of Signals and Integration**\n\n*   The spectrum shows four distinct signals.\n*   The integration values are 1H, 1H, 3H, and 3H.\n*   The total number of protons represented is 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 8 protons.\n*   Let's check the molecular formulas of the options:\n    *   Propenyl acetate (C5H8O2): 5 Carbons, 8 Hydrogens, 2 Oxygens. Total protons = 8.\n    *   Butenyl acetate (C6H10O2): 6 Carbons, 10 Hydrogens, 2 Oxygens. Total protons = 10.\n*   Since the NMR spectrum shows a total of 8 protons, we can eliminate the butenyl acetate options (B and D). The compound must be either Cis-propenyl acetate or Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n**2. Analyze Each Signal**\n\n*   **Signal 1: 2.1 ppm (3H, s)**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This region is characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Confirms it's a methyl (CH3) group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** Indicates this methyl group has no adjacent protons to couple with.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This signal is a classic signature for an acetate group (CH3-C(=O)-). This is consistent with all the options.\n\n*   **Signal 2: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This is in the alkene (vinylic) region (typically 4.5-6.5 ppm). The high value suggests the proton is on a double bond and attached to an electronegative atom like oxygen, which deshields it.\n    *   **Integration (1H):** Confirms it's a single proton on the double bond (-CH=).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** Means this proton is coupled to only one other proton.\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This value is crucial. For protons on a double bond, the coupling constant (J) tells us about their relative geometry:\n        *   **J(trans) ≈ 12-18 Hz** (for protons on opposite sides of the double bond).\n        *   **J(cis) ≈ 6-12 Hz** (for protons on the same side of the double bond).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The J value of 16.0 Hz strongly indicates a **trans** configuration. This eliminates the Cis-propenyl acetate option (C).\n\n*   **Signal 3: 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** Also in the vinylic region.\n    *   **Integration (1H):** A second single proton on the double bond.\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq, doublet of quartets):** This means the proton is split by two different sets of neighbors.\n        *   The **doublet (d)** part comes from coupling to the other vinylic proton (the one at 7.0 ppm). The coupling constant should be the same, 16.0 Hz.\n        *   The **quartet (q)** part means it is coupled to three equivalent protons (n+1=4, so n=3). This points to coupling with a neighboring methyl (CH3) group.\n\n*   **Signal 4: 1.6 ppm (3H, d)**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This is the typical region for an allylic methyl group (a CH3 group attached to a double bond).\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Confirms it's a methyl group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** This methyl group is coupled to a single proton. This confirms the conclusion from the signal at 5.5 ppm; this methyl group is being split by the proton at 5.5 ppm.\n\n**3. Assembling the Structure**\n\nLet's piece together the information:\n1.  We have an acetate group: `CH3-C(=O)-O-` (from the signal at 2.1 ppm).\n2.  We have a `trans` double bond with two protons: `-CH=CH-` (from signals at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm, and the J value).\n3.  We have a methyl group attached to the double bond: `-CH=CH-CH3` (from the signal at 1.6 ppm and the `dq` splitting at 5.5 ppm).\n4.  Let's combine them. The acetate group `CH3-C(=O)-O-` must attach to the double bond. The proton at 7.0 ppm is a simple doublet, meaning the carbon it's attached to has no other protons. This is where the oxygen atom connects. The proton at 5.5 ppm is a `dq`, meaning it's next to both the other vinyl proton and the methyl group.\n\nThe resulting structure is:\n*   `CH3(acetyl) - C(=O) - O - CH(vinylic, 7.0ppm) = CH(vinylic, 5.5ppm) - CH3(allylic, 1.6ppm)`\n*   The geometry is `trans` due to J = 16.0 Hz.\n\nThis structure is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n**4. Final Check**\n\n*   **Structure:** Trans-propenyl acetate.\n*   **Matches Option A.**\n*   The data fully supports this structure: an acetate group, a propenyl group (not butenyl), a trans geometry (not cis), and the splitting patterns all align perfectly with the proposed connectivity.\n\n<<<A>>>"
