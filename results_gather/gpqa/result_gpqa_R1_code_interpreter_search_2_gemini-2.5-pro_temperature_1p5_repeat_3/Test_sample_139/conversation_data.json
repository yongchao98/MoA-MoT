    "Here is my thinking process to solve this chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:** I'll break down the problem statement into individual clues to identify the substances involved (X, Y, W, G, B).\n\n2.  **Clue 7: The Melting Point of B:** \"The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\"\n    *   Conversion to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   This is significantly different from the 0 °C melting point of normal water (H₂O).\n    *   However, it's a near-perfect match for the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Substance B is D₂O (Heavy Water).\n\n3.  **Clue 1 & 6: Isotopes and the formation of B:**\n    *   \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope...\"\n    *   \"precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B (D₂O).\"\n    *   Since heating G produces D₂O, G must contain deuterium (D). A common reaction is the dehydration of a metal hydroxide upon heating (e.g., 2Al(OH)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3H₂O). Therefore, G is likely a metal deuteroxide, like M(OD)ₙ.\n    *   The deuterium in G and B must originate from the reactants. The problem states X incorporates the heavier isotope, so X must contain deuterium.\n\n4.  **Clue 8 & 9: The Reagent in Organic Chemistry:**\n    *   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n    *   \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\"\n    *   A keto acid has the general structure R-C(=O)-COOH, which contains **three** oxygen atoms. The reaction product has **two** oxygen atoms. This indicates a reduction reaction where one oxygen atom is removed or a carboxyl group (-COOH) is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n    *   For example: R-C(=O)-COOH + [reducing agent] → R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH. The product is a diol with two oxygen atoms.\n    *   This specific transformation (reduction of both a ketone and a carboxylic acid) is characteristic of a powerful reducing agent. A very common reagent (\"close analog\") used for this is Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄).\n    *   This strongly suggests that Substance X is the deuterated version: **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. LiAlD₄ incorporates a heavier isotope (D) and its analog, LiAlH₄, is a staple in organic chemistry.\n\n5.  **Synthesize and Verify with Other Clues:** Now let's see if X = LiAlD₄ fits the rest of the description.\n    *   **Reaction:** LiAlD₄ reacts violently with protic sources like water. The puzzle mentions it reacts violently with liquid Y. Let's test what Y could be.\n    *   **Clue 3: The Gas W:** \"a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons\". Let's assume the reaction is with heavy water (Y = D₂O), as it's a liquid and would be a logical choice in a system involving deuterated compounds.\n    *   **The Reaction:** LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂\n        *   **Is it violent?** Yes, the reaction of LiAlH₄/LiAlD₄ with water is extremely violent.\n        *   **Is a precipitate (G) formed?** Yes, Aluminium Deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, is a gelatinous precipitate. So, **G = Al(OD)₃**.\n        *   **Does heating G release B?** Yes, heating Al(OD)₃ yields aluminum oxide and heavy water: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. So, **B = D₂O**, which matches our initial finding.\n        *   **Is a gas (W) released with equal protons and neutrons?** Yes, the gas is D₂ (deuterium gas).\n            *   Protons in D₂ = 1 (from first D) + 1 (from second D) = 2 protons.\n            *   Neutrons in D₂ = 1 (from first D) + 1 (from second D) = 2 neutrons.\n            *   Protons = Neutrons. This matches perfectly. So, **W = D₂**.\n\n6.  **Conclusion on Identity:** All clues consistently point to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X (LiAlD₄)\".\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminium (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1, present as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Lightest Element (by atomic number):** Hydrogen (present as Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Heaviest Element (by atomic number):** Aluminium (Al).\n    *   We need to sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the formula LiAlD₄. We will use integer atomic masses for the isotopes involved, as the answer options are integers.\n        *   Mass of one Deuterium (¹H) atom ≈ 2 amu.\n        *   Mass of one Aluminium (²⁷Al) atom ≈ 27 amu.\n    *   The formula is LiAlD₄, so there is **one** Al atom and **four** D atoms.\n    *   Cumulative Mass = (1 × Mass of Al) + (4 × Mass of D)\n    *   Cumulative Mass = (1 × 27) + (4 × 2) = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\nTo be certain, I will use precise isotopic masses and a small script.\n*   Isotope ²H (Deuterium): mass ≈ 2.014 amu\n*   Isotope ²⁷Al (Aluminium): mass ≈ 26.982 amu\n*   Calculation: (1 * 26.982) + (4 * 2.014) = 26.982 + 8.056 = 35.038. This is extremely close to 35.\n\n```python\n# Isotopic masses are used as specified by the problem's context (heavier isotope).\n# Mass of Deuterium (2H) is approximately 2 u.\nmass_D = 2\n# The only stable isotope of Aluminium is 27Al, with a mass of approximately 27 u.\nmass_Al = 27\n\n# The substance is LiAlD4.\n# The lightest element is Hydrogen (present as D). There are 4 atoms.\n# The heaviest element is Aluminium. There is 1 atom.\n\n# The cumulative mass is the sum of the masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements.\ncumulative_mass = (4 * mass_D) + (1 * mass_Al)\nprint(cumulative_mass)\n```\n<execute_output>\n35\n</execute_output>\n\nThe calculated value is 35. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This is a step-by-step deduction to identify the substances and solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The clue states that the melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K. Converting this to Celsius gives 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C. This value is significantly different from the melting point of normal water (H₂O) at 0 °C but is almost a perfect match for the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). Therefore, substance B is heavy water, D₂O.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance G and the Isotope in X:** Substance G, when heated, releases B (D₂O). This is characteristic of a dehydration reaction. This implies that G is a metal deuteroxide, M(OD)ₓ, which decomposes upon heating to form a metal oxide and D₂O. The deuterium (D, a heavier isotope of hydrogen) in G and B must originate from the reactants. The problem states that substance X incorporates a \"heavier isotope,\" which we can now confirm is deuterium (D).\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X:** The problem provides two critical clues about X:\n    *   \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\"\n    *   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n    A keto acid (general structure R-CO-COOH) contains three oxygen atoms. A reaction that reduces the product to having only two oxygen atoms suggests a very strong reducing agent capable of reducing both the ketone and the carboxylic acid functional groups. The most famous \"analog\" reagent for this purpose in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄). Given that substance X contains deuterium, it is logical to conclude that **Substance X is Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n4.  **Verify the Reaction and Other Substances (Y, W):** Let's test the reaction of LiAlD₄ with a liquid Y to see if it matches the description. A violent reaction occurs with protic substances. A logical choice for liquid Y in a deuterated system would be heavy water, D₂O.\n    *   Reaction: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (precipitate) + 4D₂ (gas)\n    *   This reaction is indeed violent.\n    *   It forms a precipitate, **G = Al(OD)₃** (Aluminium deuteroxide). Heating G (2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O) correctly yields B (D₂O).\n    *   It releases a gas, **W = D₂** (Deuterium gas). Let's check its proton/neutron count. A deuterium atom (D or ²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. The number of protons and neutrons is the same, which perfectly matches the clue.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Mass:**\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The constituent elements are Lithium (Li, atomic number 3), Aluminium (Al, atomic number 13), and Hydrogen (in the form of its isotope Deuterium, D, atomic number 1).\n    *   The **lightest element** by atomic number is Hydrogen (present as D).\n    *   The **heaviest element** by atomic number is Aluminium (Al).\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of *all* the atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements in the molecule. We will use integer masses for the specific isotopes involved.\n        *   Mass of one Aluminium atom (²⁷Al) ≈ 27 amu.\n        *   Mass of one Deuterium atom (²H) ≈ 2 amu.\n    *   In the formula LiAlD₄, there is **1 atom of Aluminium** and **4 atoms of Deuterium**.\n    *   Cumulative Mass = (1 × Mass of Al) + (4 × Mass of D)\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 27 + (4 × 2) = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
