    "This problem involves the concept of time dilation from the theory of special relativity.\n\nHere's the reasoning process:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   The Galaxy's reference frame (let's call it S) is the \"stationary\" frame.\n    *   The supernova ejecta's reference frame (let's call it S') is the \"moving\" frame.\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the frames, `v`, is 60,000 km/s.\n    *   The time elapsed in the moving frame (S'), which is the proper time, `Δt'`, is 50 seconds.\n    *   The speed of light, `c`, is approximately 300,000 km/s. The choice of `v` as 60,000 km/s suggests that using `c = 300,000 km/s` is intended, as it simplifies the ratio `v/c` to exactly 0.2.\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (S). Let's call this distance `d`.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Plan:**\n    *   Distance in the Galaxy frame is calculated as `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (S).\n    *   The time `Δt` measured in the stationary frame (S) is related to the proper time `Δt'` measured in the moving frame (S') by the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n    *   `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n    *   By combining these formulas, we can solve for the distance `d`.\n\n5.  **Execute the Calculation:**\n    *   First, calculate the ratio `v/c`:\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Next, calculate the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n    *   Now, calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame, `Δt`:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt' = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n    *   Finally, calculate the distance `d` traveled in the Galaxy frame:\n        `d = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * ( (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s )`\n        `d = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n        `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\nTo get the final numerical value, we can use a python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the constants\nv = 60000  # km/s\nc = 300000 # km/s\ndt_prime = 50 # s\n\n# Calculate beta (v/c)\nbeta_sq = (v/c)**2\n\n# Calculate the distance d = v * dt = v * (gamma * dt_prime) = v * dt_prime / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\ndistance = (v * dt_prime) / math.sqrt(1 - beta_sq)\n\nprint(distance)\n```\n>>>\n3061862.17847847\n<<<\nThe calculated distance is approximately 3,061,862 km.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 3,000,000 km\nB) 2,880,000 km\nC) 3,060,000 km\nD) 2,940,000 km\n\nThe value 3,061,862 km is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "This problem requires using the time dilation formula from Einstein's theory of special relativity.\n\n1.  **Identify the given variables:**\n    *   Relative velocity, `v` = 60,000 km/s.\n    *   Time measured in the moving reference frame (the ejecta's frame), `Δt'` = 50 s.
