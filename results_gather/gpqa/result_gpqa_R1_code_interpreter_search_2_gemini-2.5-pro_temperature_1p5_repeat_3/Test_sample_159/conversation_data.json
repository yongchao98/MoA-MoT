    "An N-sided polygon where N approaches infinity becomes a circle. The apothem 'a' of the polygon becomes the radius of the circle. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\nThe diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture is known as an Airy pattern. This pattern consists of a bright central spot (the Airy disk) surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings. The dark rings correspond to the minima of the intensity distribution.\n\nThe angular position `θ` of these minima in the far-field (Fraunhofer diffraction) is given by the formula:\n\n`sin(θ) = m_n * λ / d`\n\nwhere:\n*   `λ` is the wavelength of the monochromatic light.\n*   `d` is the diameter of the circular aperture.\n*   `m_n` are coefficients corresponding to the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, `J1(x)`.\n\nIn this problem, the radius of the aperture is `r = a`, so the diameter is `d = 2a`. Substituting this into the formula gives:\n\n`sin(θ) = m_n * λ / (2a)`\n\nThe problem states that we can use the small-angle approximation, where `sin(θ) ≈ θ`. So, the angular positions of the minima are:\n\n`θ_n = m_n * λ / (2a)`\n\nThe first two minima correspond to the first two non-zero roots of the Bessel function `J1(x)`. The coefficients are:\n*   For the first minimum (n=1): `m_1 ≈ 1.220`\n*   For the second minimum (n=2): `m_2 ≈ 2.233`\n\nNow, we can calculate the angular position of the first two minima:\n*   Angular position of the first minimum: `θ_1 = 1.220 * λ / (2a) = 0.610 * λ / a`\n*   Angular position of the second minimum: `θ_2 = 2.233 * λ / (2a) ≈ 1.1165 * λ / a`\n\nThe question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, which is `Δθ = θ_2 - θ_1`.\n\n`Δθ = (1.1165 * λ / a) - (0.610 * λ / a)`\n`Δθ = (1.1165 - 0.610) * λ / a`\n`Δθ = 0.5065 * λ / a`\n\nRounding this to three decimal places gives `0.507 * λ / a`. Looking at the options provided, the closest value is 0.506 λ / a.\n\nLet's quickly check a potential misinterpretation: \"angular distance between the first two minima\". It could also mean the separation on one side of the central maximum from the first minimum to the second minimum, which is what we calculated. It's the most standard interpretation. Another could be the angular diameter of the second dark ring, which would be `2θ_2 - 2θ_1`, but that's less likely. Another possibility is a misreading of \"first two minima\" as \"central maximum to first minimum\", which would be `θ_1 = 0.610 * λ / a` (Option D). However, \"distance between the first two minima\" implies a difference (`θ_2 - θ_1`).\n\nOur calculated value `0.5065 * λ / a` matches option C very well.\n\nFinal calculation:\n`Δθ = θ_2 - θ_1 = (m_2 * λ / 2a) - (m_1 * λ / 2a) = ((m_2 - m_1) / 2) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ = ((2.233 - 1.220) / 2) * (λ / a) = (1.013 / 2) * (λ / a) = 0.5065 * (λ / a)`\n\nThis result is closest to 0.506 λ / a.\n\n<<<C>>>"
