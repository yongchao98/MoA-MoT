    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Understand the Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Initial State:** A single nucleus of mass `M` is at rest.\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy: `E_i = M * c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Initial momentum: `p_i = 0`.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   `m1` is the more massive fragment, `m2` is the less massive one.\n    *   Mass relationship: \"one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other\". This is interpreted as `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    *   Sum of final rest-masses: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n    *   The fragments move with kinetic energies `T1` and `T2` and momenta `p1` and `p2`.\n\n### 2. Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies\n\nWe have a system of two equations for the masses `m1` and `m2`:\n1.  `m1 = 2 * m2`\n2.  `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\n`2 * m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow find `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nWe can express their rest-mass energies in GeV:\n*   `m1 * c^2 = 0.66 * M * c^2 = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`\n*   `m2 * c^2 = 0.33 * M * c^2 = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`\n\n### 3. Calculate the Q-value (Total Kinetic Energy Released)\n\nThe Q-value of the reaction is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies, which is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n`Q = T1 + T2 = (Initial Rest-Mass - Final Rest-Mass) * c^2`\n`Q = (M - (m1 + m2)) * c^2`\n`Q = (M - 0.99 * M) * c^2 = 0.01 * M * c^2`\n`Q = 0.01 * 300 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n### 4. Calculate the Kinetic Energy `T1` (Relativistic)\n\nWe use the conservation of energy and momentum.\n*   **Momentum Conservation:** The initial momentum was zero, so the final momenta must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n*   **Energy Conservation:** The initial total energy equals the final total energy: `M*c^2 = E1 + E2`, where `E1` and `E2` are the total relativistic energies (`E = T + m*c^2`).\n    *   `E1 + E2 = 300 GeV`\n\nWe use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\nSince the magnitudes of the momenta are equal, `(p*c)^2` is the same for both fragments.\n`E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2`\n`E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2`\n\nTherefore:\n`E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n`E1^2 - E2^2 = (m1*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n`(E1 - E2)(E1 + E2) = (m1*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n\nSubstitute the known values: `E1 + E2 = 300 GeV`, `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`.\n`(E1 - E2) * 300 = 198^2 - 99^2`\n`(E1 - E2) * 300 = (39204) - (9801) = 29403`\n`E1 - E2 = 29403 / 300 = 98.01 GeV`\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations for `E1` and `E2`:\n1.  `E1 + E2 = 300 GeV`\n2.  `E1 - E2 = 98.01 GeV`\n\nAdding the two equations:\n`2 * E1 = 398.01 GeV`\n`E1 = 199.005 GeV`\n\nThe kinetic energy `T1` is the total energy `E1` minus the rest-mass energy `m1*c^2`:\n`T1_relativistic = E1 - m1*c^2 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n\n### 5. Calculate the Kinetic Energy `T1` (Classical Approximation)\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`. Since the momenta `p` are equal for both fragments:\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = (p^2 / (2*m1)) / (p^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1`\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = (0.33 * M) / (0.66 * M) = 1/2`\nSo, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n\nThe total kinetic energy is still the Q-value, `Q = 3 GeV`.\n`T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical = 1 GeV`\n\n### 6. Find the Difference\n\nThe final step is to find the difference between the relativistic `T1` and the classical `T1`, and express it in MeV (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV).\n\n*   `T1_relativistic = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV`\n*   `T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`\n\nDifference = `T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\nDifference = `1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\nThe following Python code confirms the calculation.\n```python\n# Constants and given values\nM_c2 = 300.0  # Initial rest-mass energy in GeV\n\n# Calculate fragment rest-mass energies\nm1_c2 = 0.66 * M_c2\nm2_c2 = 0.33 * M_c2\n\n# Calculate Q-value (total kinetic energy)\nQ = M_c2 - (m1_c2 + m2_c2)\n\n# --- Relativistic Calculation ---\n# Solve for E1 from the system of equations:\n# E1 + E2 = M_c2\n# E1 - E2 = (m1_c2^2 - m2_c2^2) / M_c2\nE1_minus_E2 = (m1_c2**2 - m2_c2**2) / M_c2\nE1 = (M_c2 + E1_minus_E2) / 2\nT1_relativistic = E1 - m1_c2\n\n# --- Classical Calculation ---\n# T1 + T2 = Q and T1/T2 = m2/m1 = 1/2\n# T1 + 2*T1 = Q  => 3*T1 = Q\nT1_classical = Q / 3\n\n# --- Difference ---\ndifference_GeV = T1_relativistic - T1_classical\ndifference_MeV = difference_GeV * 1000\n\nprint(f\"The difference between the relativistic and classical T1 is: {difference_MeV:.0f} MeV\")\n```\n> Rest-mass energy of fragment 1 (m1*c^2): 198.0 GeV\n> Rest-mass energy of fragment 2 (m2*c^2): 99.0 GeV\n> Q-value (total kinetic energy): 3.0 GeV\n> Relativistic kinetic energy of fragment 1 (T1_rel): 1.005 GeV\n> Classical kinetic energy of fragment 1 (T1_class): 1.0 GeV\n> Difference (T1_rel - T1_class): 5.0 MeV",
    "Here's the step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Problem Statement**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A single atomic nucleus is at rest.\n    *   Initial Mass: M\n    *   Initial Rest-Mass Energy: `E_i = M * c^2 = 300 GeV`\n    *   Initial Momentum: `p_i = 0` (since it's at rest)\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments.\n    *   Fragment 1 (more massive): rest-mass `m1`, kinetic energy `T1`\n    *   Fragment 2 (less massive): rest-mass `m2`, kinetic energy `T2`\n*   **Conditions:**\n    1.  Mass Ratio: \"one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other\". This means `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    2.  Mass Sum: \"The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M\". This means `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n*   **Objective:** Calculate the difference between the kinetic energy `T1` of the more massive fragment using relativistic physics and classical physics.\n    *   Find `T1_relativistic`.\n    *   Find `T1_classical`.\n    *   Calculate `Difference = T1_relativistic - T1_classical` (in MeV).\n\n### **2. Calculate the Rest-Masses of the Fragments**\n\nWe have a system of two equations for the masses `m1` and `m2`:\n1.  `m1 = 2 * m2`\n2.  `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`2*m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3*m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow, find `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nWe can find their rest-mass energies using the initial rest-mass energy `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`:\n*   `m1 * c^2 = 0.66 * (M * c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`\n*   `m2 * c^2 = 0.33 * (M * c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`\n\n### **3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value)**\n\nThe total kinetic energy `Q` released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final rest-mass energy. This lost mass is converted into kinetic energy.\n`Q = T1 + T2 = E_initial_rest - E_final_rest`\n`Q = M*c^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\nSo, the total kinetic energy shared by the two fragments is 3 GeV.\n\n### **4. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics**\n\nWe apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total final momentum must be zero. This means the two fragments fly apart with equal magnitude and opposite direction momenta.\n    `|p1| = |p2| = p`\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total initial energy equals the total final energy.\n    `M*c^2 = E1 + E2` where `E1` and `E2` are the *total* relativistic energies of the fragments (`E = T + m*c^2`).\n    `300 GeV = E1 + E2`\n\nWe use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\nSince the momentum `p` is the same for both, we can write:\n`(p*c)^2 = E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2`\n`(p*c)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n\nSetting them equal:\n`E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n`E1^2 - E2^2 = (m1*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\nUsing the difference of squares `a^2 - b^2 = (a-b)(a+b)`:\n`(E1 - E2)(E1 + E2) = (198 GeV)^2 - (99 GeV)^2`\n\nWe know `E1 + E2 = 300 GeV`. Let's substitute the values:\n`(E1 - E2) * 300 = (198)^2 - (99)^2`\n`(E1 - E2) * 300 = 39204 - 9801 = 29403`\n`E1 - E2 = 29403 / 300 = 98.01 GeV`\n\nNow we have a simple system of two linear equations to find `E1`:\n1.  `E1 + E2 = 300`\n2.  `E1 - E2 = 98.01`\n\nAdd the two equations:\n`2*E1 = 398.01`\n`E1 = 199.005 GeV`\n\nThe relativistic kinetic energy `T1` is the total energy `E1` minus the rest-mass energy `m1*c^2`:\n`T1_relativistic = E1 - m1*c^2 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n\n### **5. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`. Since the momenta `p` are equal:\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = (p^2 / (2*m1)) / (p^2 / (2*m2))`\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = (0.33*M) / (0.66*M) = 1/2`\nSo, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n\nThe total kinetic energy is still the Q-value, which is 3 GeV.\n`T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical = 1 GeV`\n\n### **6. Find the Difference**\n\nNow we find the difference between the two calculated values for `T1` and convert the result to MeV (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV).\n`T1_relativistic = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV`\n`T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`\n\n`Difference = T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\n`Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\nThe difference is 5 MeV.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
