    "This problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and its effect on particle decay.\n\n**1. Understand Particle Decay:**\nThe number of particles, N, remaining after a time `t` from an initial population `N₀` is given by the exponential decay law:\n`N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / T)`\nwhere `T` is the mean lifetime of the particle in the frame of reference where time `t` is measured.\n\n**2. Apply Time Dilation:**\nThe particles are moving at relativistic speeds. Their lifetime as measured in the lab frame (the detector's frame) is dilated. If the particle's mean lifetime in its own rest frame (proper lifetime) is `τ`, then its lifetime in the lab frame `T` is given by:\n`T = γ * τ`\nwhere `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n\nSo, the decay law in the lab frame becomes:\n`N(t_lab) = N₀ * exp(-t_lab / (γ * τ))`\n\nThe fraction of particles that survive (i.e., do not decay) after a time `t_lab` is `N(t_lab) / N₀`:\n`Fraction_surviving = exp(-t_lab / (γ * τ))`\n\n**3. Define the Travel Time:**\nThe particles are produced at the center of the detector and travel to the inner wall, a distance `R = 30 m`. Since they travel at ultra-relativistic velocities, their speed `v` is very close to the speed of light `c`. The time taken to reach the wall in the lab frame is:\n`t_lab = R / v ≈ R / c`\n\nSubstituting this into the survival fraction equation:\n`Fraction_surviving = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ))`\n\n**4. Use the Given Information (Case 1):**\n*   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`\n*   Fraction of particles reaching the wall = 1/3\n\n`1/3 = exp(-(R/c) / (20 * τ))`\n\nTo solve for the unknown term `(R/c) / τ`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(1/3) = -(R/c) / (20 * τ)`\n`-ln(3) = -(R/c) / (20 * τ)`\n`ln(3) = (R/c) / (20 * τ)`\n\nRearranging to isolate the constant term `(R/c) / τ`:\n`(R/c) / τ = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n**5. Solve for the Required Lorentz Factor (Case 2):**\n*   Required fraction of particles reaching the wall = 2/3\n*   We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`.\n\nUsing the same survival fraction formula:\n`2/3 = exp(-(R/c) / (γ₂ * τ))`\n\nTake the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(2/3) = -(R/c) / (γ₂ * τ)`\n`-ln(3/2) = -(R/c) / (γ₂ * τ)`\n`ln(3/2) = (R/c) / (γ₂ * τ)`\n\nRearrange to solve for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = [(R/c) / τ] / ln(3/2)`\n\nNow, substitute the value of `(R/c) / τ` that we found in Step 4:\n`γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)`\n\nLet's compute this value.\n```python\nimport math\n\ngamma_2 = 20 * math.log(3) / math.log(3/2)\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\n>54.18958253995893\n\nThe calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.19.\n\n**6.

    "The reasoning for solving this problem involves using the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation, as it applies to particle decay.\n\n**1. Survival Equation**\nThe fraction of particles that survive after a certain time is given by the exponential decay formula. In the laboratory's frame of reference (the detector), this is:\n`Fraction_surviving = N(t) / N₀ = exp(-t_lab / T)`\nwhere:\n*   `N(t)` is the number of particles remaining at time `t`.\n*   `N₀` is the initial number of particles.\n*   `t_lab` is the time measured in the lab frame.\n*   `T` is the mean lifetime of the particles as measured in the lab frame.\n\n**2. Time Dilation**\nThe mean lifetime of the moving particles is dilated due to their high velocity. The lifetime `T` in the lab frame is related to the particle's proper lifetime `τ` (its lifetime in its own rest frame) by the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n`T = γ * τ`\n\nSubstituting this into the survival equation:\n`Fraction_surviving = exp(-t_lab / (γ * τ))`\n\n**3. Travel Time**\nThe particles travel a distance equal to the detector's radius, `R = 30 m`, at a velocity `v`. Since they are ultra-relativistic, their speed is approximately the speed of light, `v ≈ c`. The time taken to reach the detector wall in the lab frame is:\n`t_lab = R / v ≈ R / c`\n\nSo the final survival equation becomes:\n`Fraction_surviving = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ))`\n\nLet's define a constant `k = (R/c) / τ`. This constant combines the detector's radius and the particle's proper lifetime, which do not change between the two scenarios. The equation simplifies to:\n`Fraction_surviving = exp(-k / γ)`\n\n**4. Analyze the First Scenario**\nWe are given:\n*   `Fraction₁ = 1/3`\n*   `γ₁ = 20`\n\nPlugging these values into the equation:\n`1/3 = exp(-k / 20)`\n\nTo find the constant `k`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(1/3) = -k / 20`\n`-ln(3) = -k / 20`\n`k = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n**5. Analyze the Second Scenario**\nWe need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`, for which the survival fraction is `2/3`.\n*   `Fraction₂ = 2/3`\n*   `γ₂ = ?`\n\nUsing the same equation:\n`2/3 = exp(-k / γ₂)`\n\nTake the natural logarithm:\n`ln(2/3) = -k / γ₂`\n`-ln(3/2) = -k / γ₂`\n`γ₂ = k / ln(3/2)`\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Answer**\nNow, substitute the expression for `k` from the first scenario into the equation for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)`\n\nThe Python code executed previously calculated this value:\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\nThis value is very close to 54.\n\nComparing with the given options:\nA) 54\nB) 40\nC) 28\nD) 68\n\nThe closest choice is 54.\n\n<<<A>>>"
