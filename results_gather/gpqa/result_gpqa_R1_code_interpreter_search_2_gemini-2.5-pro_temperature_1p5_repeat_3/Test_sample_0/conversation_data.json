    "The user wants to find the minimum energy difference required to distinguish two quantum states with given lifetimes.\n\n**1. Identify the core principle:**\nThe problem relates the lifetime of a quantum state to its energy. This is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, specifically the energy-time uncertainty relation.\n\n**2. State the principle:**\nThe energy-time uncertainty principle is given by:\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\nwhere:\n*   ΔE is the uncertainty in the energy of the state (also called the energy width of the level).\n*   Δt is the lifetime of the state.\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h / 2π).\n\nThis principle implies that a state with a finite lifetime cannot have a perfectly defined energy. Its energy is \"smeared out\" over a range ΔE.\n\n**3. Relate the principle to the problem:**\nTo \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the difference in their central energies, |E1 - E2|, must be greater than the sum of their individual energy widths (ΔE1 + ΔE2). A simpler, often-used criterion is that the energy difference must be at least as large as the larger of the two energy widths. Let's use the sum for a more rigorous condition.\n\n**4. Calculate the energy widths (ΔE1 and ΔE2):**\nWe can approximate the minimum uncertainty ΔE as ħ / Δt. We need the value of ħ in units of eV·s to get the energy in electron volts (eV).\n\nThe value of the reduced Planck constant, ħ, is approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n*   **For the first state (State 1):**\n    *   Lifetime Δt1 = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy width ΔE1 ≈ ħ / Δt1\n\n*   **For the second state (State 2):**\n    *   Lifetime Δt2 = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy width ΔE2 ≈ ħ / Δt2\n\nLet's use a python script to perform these calculations accurately.\n\n```python\n# Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nhbar_eVs = 6.582e-16\n\n# Lifetimes of the two states in seconds\ndt1 = 1e-9\ndt2 = 1e-8\n\n# Calculate the energy width for each state using the uncertainty principle (Delta_E = hbar / Delta_t)\ndE1 = hbar_eVs / dt1\ndE2 = hbar_eVs / dt2\n\n# The condition to resolve the two levels is that their energy difference\n# must be greater than the sum of their individual widths.\ntotal_width = dE1 + dE2\n\nprint(f\"Energy width of State 1 (dE1): {dE1:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy width of State 2 (dE2): {dE2:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Total width required for resolution (dE1 + dE2): {total_width:.3e} eV\")\n\n# The state with the shorter lifetime (State 1) has the larger energy width.\n# A simpler criterion is that the separation must be larger than the largest width.\nprint(f\"The largest width is: {max(dE1, dE2):.3e} eV\")\n```\nEnergy width of State 1 (dE1): 6.582e-07 eV\nEnergy width of State 2 (dE2): 6.582e-08 eV\nTotal width required for resolution (dE1 + dE2): 7.240e-07 eV\nThe largest width is: 6.582e-07 eV\n\n**5. Analyze the results:**\nFrom the calculation, the energy width of the first state (ΔE1) is about 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV, and the width of the second state (ΔE2) is about 6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV.\n\nThe total width required to clearly resolve the two levels is the sum of their individual widths, which is approximately 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV. Therefore, the energy difference between the two levels, |E1 - E2|, must be greater than this value.\n\n|E1 - E2| > 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**6. Compare with the given options:**\n\n*   A) 10⁻⁸ eV  (This is smaller than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n*   B) 10⁻⁹ eV  (This is smaller than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n*   C) 10⁻⁴ eV  (This is much larger than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n*   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV (This is smaller than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n\nOnly option C provides an energy difference that is significantly larger than the combined energy widths of the two states, allowing them to be clearly resolved.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "This problem is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time, which states:\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n\nHere:\n*   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy, also known as the natural linewidth or energy width of the quantum state.\n*   Δt is the lifetime of the state.\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant, approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\nFor a state to have a well-defined energy, its lifetime must be long. A short lifetime leads to a larger uncertainty (a broader \"smear\") in its energy.\n\nTo clearly distinguish or \"resolve\" two energy levels, E1 and E2, the difference in their energies, |E1 - E2|, must be greater than the sum of their individual energy widths (ΔE1 + ΔE2). This ensures that the energy distributions of the two states do not significantly overlap. A simpler, less strict criterion is that the energy difference should be larger than the broader of the two energy widths.\n\nLet's calculate the energy width for each state using the minimum uncertainty, ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt.\n\n**State 1:**\n*   Lifetime Δt1 = 10⁻⁹ s\n*   Energy width ΔE1 ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**State 2:**\n*   Lifetime Δt2 = 10⁻⁸ s\n*   Energy width ΔE2 ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nThe state with the shorter lifetime (State 1) has the larger energy width (ΔE1). To resolve the two levels, the energy separation must be greater than the sum of their widths:\nRequired Separation > ΔE1 + ΔE2\nRequired Separation > (6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV) ≈ 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nNow, we compare this required separation with the given options:\n\nA) 10⁻⁸ eV = 0.1 x 10⁻⁷ eV  (Too small)\nB) 10⁻⁹ eV = 0.01 x 10⁻⁷ eV (Too small)\nC) 10⁻⁴ eV = 1000 x 10⁻⁷ eV (Sufficiently large)\nD) 10⁻¹¹ eV = 0.0001 x 10⁻⁷ eV (Too small)\n\nOnly option C (10⁻⁴ eV) provides an energy difference that is significantly larger than the combined energy widths of the two states, allowing them to be clearly resolved.\n\n<<<C>>>"
