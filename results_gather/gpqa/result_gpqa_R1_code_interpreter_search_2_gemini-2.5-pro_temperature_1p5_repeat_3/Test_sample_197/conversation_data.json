    "This problem requires calculating the distribution of cobalt species in a solution with a given concentration of thiocyanate ligand.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical species:** In the solution, cobalt(II) ions (Co²⁺) react with thiocyanate ions (SCN⁻) to form a series of complexes: [Co(SCN)]⁺, [Co(SCN)₂], [Co(SCN)₃]⁻, and [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻. The total cobalt concentration, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of the free Co²⁺ ion and all its complexes.\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\n2.  **Use the overall stability constants (β):** The concentrations of the complexes can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co²⁺]`, the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`, and the overall stability constants (βn).\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴`\n\n3.  **Formulate the distribution coefficient (α):** We are interested in the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`. This is represented by its fraction, α₂, of the total cobalt concentration.\n    `α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)`\n\n4.  **Substitute the expressions:** By substituting the expressions from step 2 into the equation for `c(Co)` from step 1, we get:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n5.  **Derive the formula for α₂:** Now, substitute the expressions for `[[Co(SCN)₂]]` and `c(Co)` into the formula for `α₂`:\n    `α₂ = (β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n\n    The `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, leaving a formula that depends only on the known stability constants and the ligand concentration. Note that the total cobalt concentration, `c(Co)`, is not needed for this calculation.\n    `α₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n6.  **Plug in the values and calculate:**\n    *   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n    *   β₁ = 9\n    *   β₂ = 40\n    *   β₃ = 63\n    *   β₄ = 16\n\n    This calculation can be performed efficiently and accurately using a short script.\n\n```python\n# Given values\nL = 0.1  # [SCN-] concentration\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\n\n# Numerator of the alpha2 fraction\nnumerator = beta2 * (L**2)\n\n# Denominator of the alpha2 fraction\ndenominator = 1 + (beta1 * L) + (beta2 * L**2) + (beta3 * L**3) + (beta4 * L**4)\n\n# Calculate alpha2\nalpha2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert to percentage\npercentage_alpha2 = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(percentage_alpha2)\n```\n<execute_result>\n16.916180326482278\n</execute_result>\nThe calculation shows that the fraction of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, is approximately 16.92% of the total cobalt-containing species.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 42.3%\nB) 16.9%\nC) 25.6%\nD) 38.1%\n\nThe calculated value of 16.92% matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, which is `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n1.  **Define Species and Total Concentration**: The total cobalt concentration, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the free cobalt ion `[Co²⁺]` and all its thiocyanato complexes:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\n2.  **Use Stability Constants (β)**: The concentration of each complex can be expressed using the overall stability constants (βₙ), the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co²⁺]`, and the ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`.\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n\n3.  **Express Total Concentration**: Substitute these expressions into the equation for `c(Co)`:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n    By factoring out `[Co²⁺]`, we get:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺](1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Fraction (α₂)**: The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex, α₂, is the ratio of its concentration to the total cobalt concentration:\n    `α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)`\n\n    Substituting the expressions from steps 2 and 3:\n    `α₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺](1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n\n    The `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, simplifying the formula:\n    `α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n    Note that the total cobalt concentration `c(Co)` is not needed for this calculation, only the ligand concentration and stability constants.\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation**:\n    *   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n    *   β₁ = 9\n    *   β₂ = 40\n    *   β₃ = 63\n    *   β₄ = 16\n\n    Numerator = `β₂[SCN⁻]²` = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n\n    Denominator = 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.1²) + (63 * 0.1³) + (16 * 0.1⁴)\n    Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016\n    Denominator = 2.3646\n\n    `α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n6.  **Convert to Percentage**:\n    Percentage = `α₂ * 100% ≈ 16.916%`\n\nThis result matches the provided python code output and corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
