Identify the Nucleus and its Components**\n*   The problem specifies the nucleus is Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons.\n*   Lithium (Li) has an atomic number of 3, meaning it always has 3 protons.\n*   Therefore, the nucleus X is composed of 3 protons and 3 neutrons. This isotope is Lithium-6 (⁶Li).\n*   The total number of nucleons (protons + neutrons) is A = 6.\n\n**2. Define the Physical Principles**\nThe total energy (E) of a particle moving at relativistic speeds is given by Einstein's equation:\nE = γ * m₀c²\n\nWhere:\n*   `m₀` is the rest mass of the particle (the ⁶Li nucleus).\n*   `c` is the speed of light.\n*   `E₀ = m₀c²` is the rest energy of the particle.\n*   `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the particle's speed (v).\n\n**3. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)**\nThe Lorentz factor is calculated as:\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nGiven that the speed `v = 0.96c`, the ratio `v/c` is 0.96.\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.96²)\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.9216)\n*   γ = 1 / √(0.0784)\n*   γ = 1 / 0.28\n*   γ ≈ 3.571428\n\n**4. Determine the Rest Energy (E₀) of the Nucleus**\nThis is the most critical step. There are two common ways to determine the rest mass of the nucleus:\n\n*   **Method 1 (Physically Accurate):** Use the known atomic mass of ⁶Li and subtract the mass of the electrons. This accounts for the nuclear binding energy.\n*   **Method 2 (Approximation):** Sum the rest masses of the individual protons and neutrons. This method ignores nuclear binding energy but is sometimes used as a simplification in educational contexts.\n\nLet's calculate the result using both methods to see which one matches the provided options.\n\n**Method 2 (Approximation - Sum of Constituents):**\nWe need the rest energies of a proton and a neutron.\n*   Rest energy of a proton (mₚc²) ≈ 938.272 MeV\n*   Rest energy of a neutron (mₙc²) ≈ 939.565 MeV\n\nThe rest energy of the components of ⁶Li is:\n*   E₀ ≈ 3 * (mₚc²) + 3 * (mₙc²)\n*   E₀ ≈ 3 * (938.272 MeV) + 3 * (939.565 MeV)\n*   E₀ ≈ 2814.816 MeV + 2818.695 MeV\n*   E₀ ≈ 5633.511 MeV\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Relativistic Energy (E)**\nNow, we use the total rest energy from Method 2 with the Lorentz factor:\n*   E = γ * E₀\n*   E ≈ 3.571428 * 5633.511 MeV\n*   E ≈ 20119.68 MeV\n\n**6. Convert to Giga-electron-volts (GeV)**\nSince 1 GeV = 1000 MeV:\n*   E ≈ 20119.68 / 1000 GeV\n*   E ≈ 20.120 GeV\n\n**7. Compare with Options**\nThe calculated value is 20.120 GeV. Let's look at the options:\nA) 20.132 GeV\nB) 23.069 GeV\nC) 21.419\nD) 18.475 GeV\n\nThe value of 20.120 GeV is extremely close to option A (20.132 GeV). The minor difference (less than 0.1%) is likely due to using slightly different values for the proton/neutron masses in the problem's source material. The calculation based on the physically accurate nuclear mass gives ~20.005 GeV, which is further from any option. Therefore, the intended method was to sum the constituent masses.\n\nThe final answer is **A**.\n\n<<<A>>>",

Determine the Rest Energy (E₀) of the Nucleus**\nFor this type of problem, the rest energy of the nucleus is best approximated by summing the rest energies of its constituent protons and neutrons. (Using the precise atomic mass and subtracting electron mass yields a result around 20.005 GeV, which does not match any option, indicating this simpler approximation is intended).\n\nWe need the standard rest energies:\n*   Rest energy of a proton (mₚc²) ≈ 938.272 MeV\n*   Rest energy of a neutron (mₙc²) ≈ 939.565 MeV\n\nThe rest energy of the ⁶Li nucleus is the sum of 3 protons and 3 neutrons:\n*   E₀ ≈ 3 * (mₚc²) + 3 * (mₙc²)\n*   E₀ ≈ 3 * (938.272 MeV) + 3 * (939.565 MeV)\n*   E₀ ≈ 2814.816 MeV + 2818.695 MeV\n*   E₀ ≈ 5633.511 MeV\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Relativistic Energy (E)**\nNow, we use the rest energy with the Lorentz factor:\n*   E = γ * E₀\n*   E ≈ 3.5714 * 5633.511 MeV\n*   E ≈ 20119.6 MeV\n\n**6. Convert to Giga-electron-volts (GeV)**\nSince 1 GeV = 1000 MeV:\n*   E ≈ 20119.6 / 1000 GeV\n*   E ≈ 20.120 GeV\n\n**7. Compare with Options**\nThe calculated value is 20.120 GeV.

The minor difference (less than 0.1%) is likely due to the use of slightly different, rounded values for the proton and neutron masses in the source material for the question. This confirms that option A is the intended answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
