    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe problem asks for two quantities for a system of two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds:\na) The relative speed ($v_{rel}$) between the two astronauts.\nb) The total energy ($E$) of the system.\n\n**2. List the Given Information:**\n*   Mass of astronaut 1 ($m_1$): $2m$\n*   Velocity of astronaut 1 ($v_1$): $0.6c$ (in the positive x-direction)\n*   Mass of astronaut 2 ($m_2$): $3m$\n*   Velocity of astronaut 2 ($v_2$): $0.5c$ (in the positive x-direction)\n*   $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n**3. Calculate the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$):**\nSince the speeds are relativistic, we must use the Lorentz velocity transformation formula to find the relative speed. The formula for the relative velocity of two objects moving in the same direction is:\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\nNow, substitute the given values into the formula:\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.142857c$\n\nSo, the relative speed is approximately **$0.14c$**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Energy ($E$):**\nThe total energy of a relativistic system of non-interacting particles is the sum of the total energies of each particle. The formula for the total energy of a single particle is:\n$E_{particle} = \\gamma mc^2$\nwhere $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is given by:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$\n\nWe need to calculate the energy for each astronaut and then add them together.\n\n*   **Energy of Astronaut 1 ($E_1$):**\n    *   First, calculate the Lorentz factor $\\gamma_1$:\n        $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_1^2}{c^2}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n    *   Now, calculate the energy $E_1$:\n        $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = 1.25 \\times (2m) \\times c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n*   **Energy of Astronaut 2 ($E_2$):**\n    *   First, calculate the Lorentz factor $\\gamma_2$:\n        $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_2^2}{c^2}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}}$\n        $\\sqrt{0.75} \\approx 0.866$\n        $\\gamma_2 \\approx \\frac{1}{0.866} \\approx 1.1547$\n    *   Now, calculate the energy $E_2$:\n        $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 \\approx 1.1547 \\times (3m) \\times c^2 \\approx 3.4641 mc^2$\n\n*   **Total Energy ($E_{total}$):**\n    *   Add the energies of the two astronauts:\n        $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.4641 mc^2$\n        $E_{total} = (2.5 + 3.4641) mc^2 = 5.9641 mc^2$\n\nSo, the total energy of the system is approximately **$5.96 mc^2$**.\n\nTo confirm the numerical calculations, we can use a Python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the masses and velocities\nm1_val = 2\nv1_val = 0.6\nm2_val = 3\nv2_val = 0.5\n\n# Calculate relative speed\nv_rel = (v1_val - v2_val) / (1 - v1_val * v2_val)\n\n# Calculate Lorentz factor for astronaut 1\ngamma1 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v1_val**2)\n# Calculate energy for astronaut 1 (in units of mc^2)\nE1 = gamma1 * m1_val\n\n# Calculate Lorentz factor for astronaut 2\ngamma2 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v2_val**2)\n# Calculate energy for astronaut 2 (in units of mc^2)\nE2 = gamma2 * m2_val\n\n# Calculate total energy (in units of mc^2)\nE_total = E1 + E2\n\nprint(f\"v_rel={v_rel:.2f}c, E={E_total:.2f}mc^2\")\n```\n\n**5.

    "Here's the breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Calculate the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\nFor objects moving at relativistic speeds, we cannot simply subtract their velocities. We must use the relativistic velocity addition formula (in this case, for finding the difference). The formula for the relative speed of two objects moving in the same direction is:\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $v_1 = 0.6c$\n*   $v_2 = 0.5c$\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7} = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.1428c$\n\nSo, the relative speed is approximately **$0.14c$**.\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Energy ($E_{total}$)**\n\nThe total energy of a system is the sum of the total energies of its individual parts. The total energy ($E$) of a single particle with rest mass ($m_0$) moving at velocity ($v$) is given by:\n\n$E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$\n\nWhere $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is:\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$\n\nWe need to calculate the energy for each astronaut and add them together.\n\n**For Astronaut 1:**\n*   Mass ($m_1$) = $2m$\n*   Velocity ($v_1$) = $0.6c$\n*   Lorentz factor ($\\gamma_1$):\n    $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n*   Energy ($E_1$):\n    $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = 1.25 \\times (2m) c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n**For Astronaut 2:**\n*   Mass ($m_2$) = $3m$\n*   Velocity ($v_2$) = $0.5c$\n*   Lorentz factor ($\\gamma_2$):\n    $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} \\approx \\frac{1}{0.866} \\approx 1.1547$\n*   Energy ($E_2$):\n    $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 \\approx 1.1547 \\times (3m) c^2 \\approx 3.464 mc^2$\n\n**Total Energy ($E_{total}$):**\n*   $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.464 mc^2 = 5.964 mc^2$\n\nSo, the total energy is approximately **$5.96 mc^2$**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   Relative speed ($v_{rel}$) $\\approx 0.14c$\n*   Total energy ($E$) $\\approx 5.96 mc^2$\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
