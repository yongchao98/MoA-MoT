    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Benzene ring:** The core structure.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    *   A bromine atom (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The groups are at positions 1, 3, and 5. This is a *meta, meta* relationship. Each substituent is meta to the other two.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nThe order in which these groups are added to the benzene ring is crucial. The directing effect of the groups already on the ring determines the position of the next incoming group.\n*   **-COCH₃ (acetyl):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NO₂ (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-NH₂ (amino):** Strongly activating and an *ortho, para*-director. (This group is often used as an intermediate by reducing a nitro group).\n\n**3. Key Synthetic Constraints**\n\nA critical rule in electrophilic aromatic substitution is that **Friedel-Crafts reactions (both alkylation and acylation) fail on strongly deactivated rings**. This means you cannot perform a Friedel-Crafts acylation (using CH₃COCl/AlCl₃) on a benzene ring that has a nitro group (-NO₂) on it.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options based on Constraints and Directing Effects**\n\nLet's analyze each proposed sequence:\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4`\n    *   Step (i) forms nitrobenzene.\n    *   Step (v) brominates to give 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene.\n    *   Step (vi) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene. This ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group. The reaction will fail. Therefore, option A is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...`\n    *   Step (i) forms nitrobenzene.\n    *   Step (ii) reduces it to aniline.\n    *   Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. Aniline is basic and reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), forming a strongly deactivating complex (-NH₃⁺). This either prevents the ring acylation or directs the group meta, but the whole process is problematic and not a high-yield method for C-acylation. Usually, the amine is protected first. Even so, the resulting products do not lead to the desired 1,3,5 pattern. Therefore, option B is unlikely.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...`\n    *   Step (i) forms bromobenzene.\n    *   Step (ii) is nitration. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director. This will primarily form 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene and 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene. The target molecule requires the bromo and nitro groups to be *meta* to each other. This path does not yield the correct isomer relationship.\n    *   Furthermore, step (iii) attempts Friedel-Crafts acylation on a nitrobromobenzene, which will fail due to the deactivating nitro group. Therefore, option C is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ...`\n    *   **Step (i): Friedel-Crafts Acylation.** Benzene + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ → Acetophenone. This is a standard, efficient reaction. The ring now has a meta-directing acetyl group.\n    *   **Step (ii): Bromination.** Acetophenone + Br₂/FeBr₃ → 3-Bromoacetophenone. The acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the *meta* position (C3). This successfully creates the 1,3-relationship between the acetyl and bromo groups.\n    *   **Step (iii): Nitration.** 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO₃/H₂SO₄. Now we add the nitro group. The ring has two substituents:\n        *   -COCH₃ at C1 (meta-director)\n        *   -Br at C3 (ortho, para-director)\n        The -COCH₃ group directs the incoming -NO₂ to position C5. The -Br group directs to C2, C4, and C6. Although the directors are in conflict, the position that is *meta* to both deactivating groups (C5) is the least deactivated and therefore the preferred site of attack for the electrophile. This reaction gives a high yield of the desired product, **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe sequence of reactions (i), (ii), and (iii) in option D provides a valid, high-yield pathway to the target molecule. The subsequent steps (iv through vii) in the option would modify the target molecule into something else and appear to be extraneous or part of a flawed question design. However, among the given choices, only option D contains a correct and logical synthetic route to achieve the desired product. The other options fail due to fundamental chemical principles (invalid reactions or incorrect regiochemistry). Therefore, option D is the best answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
