    "This problem involves a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction of an aryl halide with a strong base, NaNH2, in liquid ammonia. This reaction proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism involving a benzyne intermediate.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reactants**\n\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene molecule where the carbon at position 1 is attached to a bromine atom (Br), and the carbon at position 2 is attached to a deuterium atom (D). All other positions (3, 4, 5, 6) have hydrogen atoms (H). Deuterium is an isotope of hydrogen.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is a very strong base, with the active species being the amide anion (NH2⁻). It is also the source of the nucleophile for the addition step.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of the Benzyne Intermediate (Elimination)**\n\nThe reaction begins with the deprotonation of the aryl halide at a position ortho to the halogen. The strong base NH2⁻ abstracts an acidic proton. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions to the bromine at C1: C2 and C6.\n\n*   **Path A: Abstraction of Hydrogen from C6**\n    1.  The base NH2⁻ abstracts a proton (H⁺) from the C6 position. This is the kinetically favored pathway because the C-H bond is weaker and broken more easily than the C-D bond (this is known as the kinetic isotope effect).\n    2.  This forms a carbanion at C6.\n    3.  The carbanion intermediate quickly eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from the adjacent C1 position.\n    4.  A triple bond is formed between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected in this process.\n    5.  The resulting intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Path B: Abstraction of Deuterium from C2**\n    1.  The base NH2⁻ abstracts a deuteron (D⁺) from the C2 position. This pathway is slower than Path A due to the stronger C-D bond.\n    2.  This forms a carbanion at C2.\n    3.  The carbanion eliminates the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    4.  A triple bond is formed between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is removed from the molecule in this process.\n    5.  The resulting intermediate is **benzyne** (with no deuterium).\n\nSince the question asks for all *possible* organic products, we must consider the products from both benzyne intermediates, even though Path B is slower.\n\n**Step 3: Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates (Addition)**\n\nThe nucleophile, which is also the amide anion (NH2⁻), attacks one of the carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent, ammonia (NH3), to give the final product.\n\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Path A):**\n    *   The intermediate is 3-deuterobenzyne, with the triple bond between C1 and C6 and a deuterium at C2.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** If NH2⁻ attacks C1, a carbanion is formed at C6. Protonation by NH3 gives **2-deuterioaniline** (NH2 group at C1, D at C2).\n    *   **Attack at C6:** If NH2⁻ attacks C6, a carbanion is formed at C1. Protonation by NH3 gives **3-deuterioaniline** (when renumbered according to IUPAC rules, with the NH2 group at C1, the deuterium is at the C3 position).\n    *   This intermediate leads to two distinct products.\n\n*   **Products from benzyne (from Path B):**\n    *   The intermediate is the simple, non-deuterated benzyne, with the triple bond between C1 and C2.\n    *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** Due to the symmetry of this intermediate, attack at either C1 or C2, followed by protonation, leads to the same single product: **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n    *   This intermediate leads to one distinct product.\n\n**Step 4: Tally the Total Number of Possible Products**\n\nBy considering all possible reaction pathways, we have identified three structurally distinct organic products:\n1.  2-deuterioaniline\n2.  3-deuterioaniline\n3.  Aniline\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>"
