    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   We are given a relationship between the number of stars and their parallax (`plx`).\n    *   We need to find the relationship between the number of stars per unit distance and the distance (`r`).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Given Information:**\n    *   \"The number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5\". This phrase describes a distribution. In physics and astronomy, this typically refers to the number density or the differential number of stars per unit interval of the variable. So, we can write this as:\n        `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`\n        where `dN/d(plx)` is the number of stars per unit range of parallax.\n\n3.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    *   We need to find how \"the number of stars... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)\". This is asking for the quantity `dN/dr`, which is the number of stars per unit range of distance.\n\n4.  **Establish the Connection between Parallax and Distance:**\n    *   Parallax is defined as the inverse of the distance. For parallax `plx` in arcseconds and distance `r` in parsecs, the relationship is:\n        `plx = 1/r`\n\n5.  **Use Calculus to Transform the Distribution:**\n    *   We want to convert a distribution with respect to parallax (`dN/d(plx)`) to a distribution with respect to distance (`dN/dr`). We can use the chain rule of differentiation:\n        `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n    *   Since the number of stars in a given volume must be positive, we are concerned with the magnitude of the relationship. So, we should use the absolute value of the transformation derivative (the Jacobian):\n        `dN/dr = |(dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)| = (dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|` (as `dN/d(plx)` is also a density and positive).\n\n6.  **Calculate the Derivative `d(plx)/dr`:**\n    *   Starting with `plx = 1/r = r⁻¹`, we differentiate with respect to `r`:\n        `d(plx)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n    *   The absolute value is:\n        `|d(plx)/dr| = 1/r²`\n\n7.  **Substitute and Solve:**\n    *   Now substitute the known parts back into the chain rule equation:\n        `dN/dr ∝ (1/plx⁵) * |d(plx)/dr|`\n        `dN/dr ∝ (1/plx⁵) * (1/r²)`\n    *   The expression is currently in terms of both `plx` and `r`. We need it solely in terms of `r`. Substitute `plx = 1/r` into the expression:\n        `dN/dr ∝ (1 / (1/r)⁵) * (1/r²)`\n        `dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (1/r²)`\n        `dN/dr ∝ r^(5-2)`\n        `dN/dr ∝ r³`\n\n8.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The number of stars per unit range of distance, `dN/dr`, is proportional to `r³`. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
