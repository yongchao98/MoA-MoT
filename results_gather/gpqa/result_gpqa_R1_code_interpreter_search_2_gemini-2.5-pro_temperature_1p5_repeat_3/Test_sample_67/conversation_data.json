    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Define the Initial State\n\n*   The particle is spin-1/2. Its magnetic moment is a vector operator `μ = γS`, where `S` is the spin operator and `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n*   The spin operator `S` has components `(Sx, Sy, Sz)`.\n*   Initially, the magnetic field is `B_initial = B ẑ` (in the +Z direction).\n*   The Hamiltonian of the system is `H = -μ · B`.\n*   So, the initial Hamiltonian is `H_initial = - (γS) · (B ẑ) = -γB Sz`.\n*   The problem states the particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with the field. This means the system is in its lowest energy eigenstate.\n*   The eigenstates of `Sz` are spin-up `|+z>` (eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z>` (eigenvalue `-ħ/2`).\n*   The corresponding energies are:\n    *   `E(+z) = -γB (+ħ/2) = -γBħ/2`\n    *   `E(-z) = -γB (-ħ/2) = +γBħ/2`\n*   The lowest energy state is `|+z>`. Therefore, the initial state of the particle at time `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n*   In the standard basis where `|+z> = [1, 0]^T` and `|-z> = [0, 1]^T`, the initial state is `ψ(0) = [1, 0]^T`.\n\n### 2. Define the New Hamiltonian and Time Evolution\n\n*   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is suddenly changed to `B_new = B ŷ` (in the +Y direction).\n*   The new Hamiltonian for `t > 0` is `H_new = -μ · B_new = - (γS) · (B ŷ) = -γB Sy`.\n*   The spin operator `Sy` in the z-basis is `Sy = (ħ/2) * σ_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n*   The state of the system evolves according to the Schrödinger equation: `|ψ(t)> = e^(-i H_new t / ħ) |ψ(0)>`.\n\n### 3. Method 1: Time Evolution in the Energy Eigenbasis\n\nTo calculate the time evolution, it's easiest to work in the eigenbasis of the new Hamiltonian, `H_new`. The eigenstates of `H_new` are the eigenstates of `Sy`.\n\n*   **Eigenstates of Sy:**\n    The eigenvalues of `Sy` are `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`. The corresponding normalized eigenvectors are:\n    *   `|+y> = (1/√2) * (|+z> + i |-z>) = (1/√2) * [1, i]^T` (for eigenvalue `+ħ/2`)\n    *   `|-y> = (1/√2) * (|+z> - i |-z>) = (1/√2) * [1, -i]^T` (for eigenvalue `-ħ/2`)\n\n*   **Express Initial State in New Basis:**\n    We need to write `|ψ(0)> = |+z>` as a superposition of `|+y>` and `|-y>`. By rearranging the above equations:\n    `|+z> = (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>)`\n\n*   **Apply Time Evolution:**\n    The energies corresponding to the eigenstates `|+y>` and `|-y>` are:\n    *   `E(+y) = -γB (eigenvalue of Sy) = -γB (+ħ/2) = -γBħ/2`\n    *   `E(-y) = -γB (eigenvalue of Sy) = -γB (-ħ/2) = +γBħ/2`\n    Now, we evolve the state:\n    `|ψ(t)> = e^(-iH_new t/ħ) |ψ(0)> = e^(-iH_new t/ħ) * (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>)`\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [ e^(-iE(+y) t/ħ) |+y> + e^(-iE(-y) t/ħ) |-y> ]`\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [ e^(-i(-γBħ/2)t/ħ) |+y> + e^(-i(+γBħ/2)t/ħ) |-y> ]`\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [ e^(iγBt/2) |+y> + e^(-iγBt/2) |-y> ]`\n\n*   **Calculate the Expectation Value:**\n    We need the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)> = γ <ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)>`.\n    Let's convert `|ψ(t)>` back to the z-basis:\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [ e^(iγBt/2) * (1/√2)(|+z> + i|-z>) + e^(-iγBt/2) * (1/√2)(|+z> - i|-z>) ]`\n    `|ψ(t)> = (1/2) * [ (e^(iγBt/2) + e^(-iγBt/2)) |+z> + i(e^(iγBt/2) - e^(-iγBt/2)) |-z> ]`\n    Using Euler's formulas `cos(θ) = (e^(iθ)+e^(-iθ))/2` and `sin(θ) = (e^(iθ)-e^(-iθ))/(2i)`:\n    `|ψ(t)> = cos(γBt/2) |+z> - sin(γBt/2) |-z>`\n    The state vector is `[cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)]^T`.\n    Now calculate `<Sz>(t) = <ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)>`.\n    Since `Sz = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`:\n    `<Sz>(t) = [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] * (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)]^T`\n    `<Sz>(t) = (ħ/2) * (cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2))`\n    Using the double-angle identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`:\n    `<Sz>(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(2 * (γBt/2)) = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n\n*   **Find the Oscillation Frequency:**\n    The average of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n    `<μ_z>(t) = γ <Sz>(t) = γ(ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n    The value `<μ_z>(t)` oscillates as `cos(Ωt)`, where the angular frequency `Ω` is the coefficient of `t`.\n    By inspection, the angular frequency of oscillation is `Ω = γB`.\n\n### 4. Method 2: Larmor Precession (Ehrenfest's Theorem)\n\nThis problem describes Larmor precession. The equation of motion for the expectation value of the spin vector `<S>` in a magnetic field `B` is given by:\n`d<S>/dt = γ <S> × B`\n\n*   In our case, `B = B ŷ`.\n    `d<S>/dt = γ (<Sx>x̂ + <Sy>ŷ + <Sz>ẑ) × (B ŷ)`\n    `d<S>/dt = γB * [ <Sx>(x̂×ŷ) + <Sz>(ẑ×ŷ) ]`\n    `d<S>/dt = γB * [ <Sx>ẑ - <Sz>x̂ ]`\n\n*   Writing this out in component form:\n    1.  `d<Sx>/dt = -γB <Sz>`\n    2.  `d<Sy>/dt = 0`\n    3.  `d<Sz>/dt = γB <Sx>`\n\n*   We can solve this system of differential equations. Differentiate equation (3) with respect to time:\n    `d²<Sz>/dt² = γB * d<Sx>/dt`\n    Substitute equation (1) into this new equation:\n    `d²<Sz>/dt² = γB * (-γB <Sz>) = -(γB)² <Sz>`\n\n*   This is the standard equation for a simple harmonic oscillator, `d²x/dt² = -Ω²x`. The angular frequency of oscillation `Ω` is the square root of the constant, so:\n    `Ω = γB`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's magnetic moment is `γB`. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
