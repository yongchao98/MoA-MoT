    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning process to determine the correct statement:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Problem:** The scientist wants to perform a tandem catalytic reaction. The first catalyst polymerizes ethylene into a linear chain (forming High-Density Polyethylene, HDPE). The second catalyst must oligomerize ethylene into a short alpha-olefin (like 1-hexene or 1-octene). The first catalyst then incorporates these alpha-olefins as branches into the growing polymer chains. The final product is a branched polymer, specifically Linear Low-Density Polyethylene (LLDPE), which has \"regular branches\" (i.e., branches of a consistent length).\n\n2.  **Evaluate Statement A: \"One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.\"**\n    *   The \"essential additional reaction step\" is the selective oligomerization of ethylene to form alpha-olefins.\n    *   Group VIa of the periodic table (or Group 6 in modern IUPAC notation) contains Chromium (Cr), Molybdenum (Mo), and Tungsten (W).\n    *   Chromium-based catalysts are well-known and commercially used for the highly selective trimerization of ethylene to 1-hexene and tetramerization to 1-octene.\n    *   These catalyst systems, for example, based on a chromium salt, a pyrrolide ligand, and an activator, are prime examples of this technology.\n    *   Therefore, it is factually correct that a Group VIa metal catalyst can be used for this purpose. The statement is correct.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Statement B: \"Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.\"**\n    *   The additional step is ethylene oligomerization.\n    *   Catalysts, particularly organometallic ones, almost always require an activator (or co-catalyst) to generate the active catalytic species.\n    *   For chromium-based oligomerization catalysts, the most common and effective activators are aluminum-based compounds, specifically methylaluminoxane (MAO) and modified methylaluminoxane (MMAO).\n    *   Therefore, this statement is factually incorrect. Aluminum-based activators are often essential.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Statement C: \"Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.\"**\n    *   This refers to the overall tandem process of making LLDPE from ethylene in a single reactor.\n    *   Major chemical companies in the US, such as Univation Technologies (a joint venture of Dow and ExxonMobil) and Chevron Phillips Chemical, have developed and commercialized technologies (e.g., as part of the UNIPOL™ process) that use in-situ comonomer generation.\n    *   These systems are in operation at an industrial scale, reducing the cost of LLDPE production by not requiring a separate feed of comonomer.\n    *   Thus, on the surface, this statement also appears to be correct.\n\n5.  **Evaluate Statement D: \"Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.\"**\n    *   Noble metals (e.g., Palladium, Platinum, Rhodium) are known to catalyze various olefin reactions. While research exists, the most efficient and commercially viable catalysts for selective ethylene oligomerization are based on more abundant metals like chromium and titanium.\n    *   Noble metals are inherently much more expensive than chromium, so the cost argument is valid. However, whether they can be effectively \"used\" for this specific purpose (high selectivity to one specific alpha-olefin) is less established than the chromium systems. This statement is plausible but less definitive and central to the established technology than statement A.\n\n6.  **Compare the Correct Statements (A and C):** In many multiple-choice questions, if two options appear correct, one might be more precise or there could be a subtle inaccuracy in the other.\n    *   Statement A is a fundamental statement about the type of catalyst used for the key chemical transformation (oligomerization). It is a well-established fact in catalysis chemistry.\n    *   Statement C is about the method of implementation (\"Such combined systems...\"). The scientist \"intends to add a second catalyst system\". Industrial processes may use a more sophisticated method, such as a single catalyst particle containing two distinct active sites. If \"Such combined systems\" is interpreted strictly as \"mixing two separate catalysts\", it might not accurately describe the most advanced industrial processes, making the statement potentially inaccurate in a subtle way.\n    *   Given this potential ambiguity in statement C, statement A stands out as the most robust and factually unassailable statement of chemical principle relevant to the problem. It describes a key component required for the desired reaction, and this fact holds true regardless of the exact method of industrial implementation. Therefore, it is the most reliably correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
