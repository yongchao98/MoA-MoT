    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify Compound A and the subsequent reaction products.**\n\n*   **Compound A (C3H6):** The molecular formula C3H6 corresponds to either propene (CH3-CH=CH2) or cyclopropane. The reaction is bromination in CCl4, a classic test for unsaturation (double or triple bonds). Propene readily undergoes electrophilic addition with Br2. So, A is propene.\n*   **A → B:** Propene reacts with bromine (Br2) in carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). This is an addition reaction across the double bond.\n    *   `CH3-CH=CH2 (Propene) + Br2 --(CCl4)--> CH3-CH(Br)-CH2(Br)`\n    *   **Compound B is 1,2-Dibromopropane.**\n\n*   **B → C:** Compound B (1,2-Dibromopropane) reacts with alcoholic potassium hydroxide (KOH). Alcoholic KOH is a strong base used for dehydrohalogenation. With a vicinal dihalide (two halogens on adjacent carbons), it causes double dehydrohalogenation to form an alkyne.\n    *   `CH3-CH(Br)-CH2(Br) + 2 KOH (alcoholic) --(heat)--> CH3-C≡CH + 2 KBr + 2 H2O`\n    *   **Compound C is Propyne.**\n\n*   **C → D:** Compound C (Propyne) is passed through a red-hot iron tube. This condition causes the cyclotrimerization of alkynes. Three molecules of propyne will polymerize to form a trimethylated benzene. For steric and stability reasons, the major product is the most symmetrical isomer.\n    *   `3 CH3-C≡CH --(red-hot Fe tube)--> 1,3,5-Trimethylbenzene`\n    *   **Compound D is 1,3,5-Trimethylbenzene (also known as Mesitylene).**\n\n*   **D → E:** Compound D (Mesitylene) reacts with a mixture of two strong acids, which is the nitrating mixture (concentrated HNO3 and concentrated H2SO4). This performs electrophilic aromatic nitration. The three methyl groups are activating and direct the incoming electrophile (-NO2) to the positions ortho/para to them. In mesitylene, positions 2, 4, and 6 are all equivalent.\n    *   `1,3,5-Trimethylbenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 --> 2-Nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene`\n    *   **Compound E is 2-Nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene.**\n\n*   **E → F:** Compound E reacts with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid (Fe/HCl). This is a standard method for the reduction of an aromatic nitro group (-NO2) to an amino group (-NH2).\n    *   `2-Nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene + Fe/HCl --> 2-Amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene`\n    *   **Compound F is 2-Amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (Mesitylamine or 2,4,6-trimethylaniline).**\n\n*   **F → G:** Compound F (an aromatic primary amine) reacts with nitrous acid (HONO, formed in situ from NaNO2 and HCl at 0-5 °C). This is a diazotization reaction.\n    *   `2-Amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene + NaNO2/HCl --> 2,4,6-Trimethylbenzenediazonium chloride`\n    *   **Compound G is 2,4,6-Trimethylbenzenediazonium salt.**\n\n*   **G → H:** Compound G (a diazonium salt) reacts with sodium hydroxide (or simply heated with water). The diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group, forming a phenol.\n    *   `2,4,6-Trimethylbenzenediazonium salt + H2O/NaOH --(heat)--> 2,4,6-Trimethylphenol`\n    *   **Compound H is 2,4,6-Trimethylphenol.**\n\n**2. Evaluate each statement.**\n\n*   **A) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n    *   F is 2,4,6-trimethylaniline. Aromatic amines (anilines) are cornerstone precursors for the synthesis of azo dyes. They are diazotized (like in the step to form G) and then coupled with other aromatic compounds to produce colorful dyes. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **B) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n    *   H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is a characteristic test for phenols, which typically produces a violet, blue, or green color due to the formation of an iron-phenol complex.\n    *   However, in 2,4,6-trimethylphenol, the two methyl groups at the ortho positions (2 and 6) cause significant steric hindrance around the -OH group. This hindrance prevents the formation of the colored complex with Fe(III) ions.\n    *   Therefore, 2,4,6-trimethylphenol gives a *negative* ferric chloride test. A negative test means no characteristic color change occurs. Since the ferric chloride solution itself is yellowish-brown, the resulting mixture will simply be yellow.\n    *   The statement \"H gives a yellow color\" is a description of the final observation. However, in the context of chemical tests, \"gives a color\" implies the formation of a colored product. Since no yellow product is formed (the color is from the unreacted reagent), this statement is chemically misleading and considered **incorrect**. The proper description is that it gives a negative test.\n\n*   **C) C is a flammable gas.**\n    *   C is propyne (CH3-C≡CH). Its boiling point is -23.2 °C, so it is a gas at room temperature. As a low-molecular-weight hydrocarbon, it is highly flammable. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **D) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\n    *   D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene). This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   1. The three aromatic protons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single signal. Since they have no adjacent non-equivalent protons, this signal is a singlet.\n    *   2. The nine protons of the three methyl groups are also chemically equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry. They will produce another single signal, which is also a singlet.\n    *   Therefore, the 1H NMR spectrum of mesitylene consists of two singlets. This statement is **correct**.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nStatements A, C, and D are factually and unambiguously correct based on standard organic chemistry principles. Statement B is the only one that is incorrect from a formal chemical perspective, as H (2,4,6-trimethylphenol) does not *produce* a yellow color but rather fails to react with the yellow reagent, resulting in a negative test.\n\n<<<B>>>"
