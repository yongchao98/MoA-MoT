    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary objective is to calculate the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 ($L_1$) to the luminosity of Star_2 ($L_2$), which is $L_1 / L_2$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Relevant Physics Principle:** The luminosity of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is described by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    $L = 4 \\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\n    where:\n    *   $L$ is the luminosity.\n    *   $R$ is the star's radius.\n    *   $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   $T$ is the star's effective surface temperature.\n\n3.  **Set up the Ratio:** To find the ratio of luminosities, we can divide the equation for Star_1 by the equation for Star_2:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (4 \\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4) / (4 \\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4)$\n    The constants $4$, $\\pi$, and $\\sigma$ cancel out, leaving:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (R_1^2 / R_2^2) * (T_1^4 / T_2^4) = (R_1 / R_2)^2 * (T_1 / T_2)^4$\n\n4.  **Analyze the Given Information on Radii:** The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times the radius of Star_2:\n    $R_1 = 1.5 * R_2$\n    This means the ratio of the radii is:\n    $R_1 / R_2 = 1.5$\n\n5.  **Analyze the Given Information on Temperature:**\n    *   The problem states that the wavelength at which the stars appear brightest ($\\lambda_{max}$) is the same for both. This refers to Wien's Displacement Law:\n        $\\lambda_{max} = b / T$\n        where $b$ is Wien's constant.\n    *   The crucial point here is whether the \"observed\" peak wavelengths are the same or the \"rest-frame\" peak wavelengths (the actual wavelengths emitted by the stars) are the same.\n    *   It is mentioned that \"astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same\". This implies they have already corrected for any observational effects, such as the Doppler shift caused by radial velocity. Astronomers typically report intrinsic properties of stars by correcting for such effects.\n    *   Therefore, we should assume that the rest-frame peak wavelengths are the same: $\\lambda_{max, rest, 1} = \\lambda_{max, rest, 2}$.\n    *   According to Wien's Law, if the rest-frame peak wavelengths are equal, their surface temperatures must also be equal:\n        $b / T_1 = b / T_2 \\implies T_1 = T_2$\n    *   This gives a temperature ratio of $T_1 / T_2 = 1$.\n    *   The information about the radial velocities (0 km/s and 700 km/s) and the mass ratio ($M_1/M_2=1.5$) becomes extraneous details, likely included to test the understanding of which physical principles are relevant. If we were to consider the Doppler effect on the *observed* wavelength, the resulting change in the luminosity ratio would be minuscule (less than 1%) and wouldn't align with the provided options.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Luminosity Ratio:** Now, substitute the ratios for radius and temperature back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (R_1 / R_2)^2 * (T_1 / T_2)^4$\n    $L_1 / L_2 = (1.5)^2 * (1)^4$\n    $L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 * 1$\n    $L_1 / L_2 = 2.25$\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated factor is 2.25. This matches option B.\n    A) ~2.35\n    B) ~2.25\n    C) ~2.32\n    D) ~2.23\n\nThe luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of 2.25.\n\n<<<B>>>"
