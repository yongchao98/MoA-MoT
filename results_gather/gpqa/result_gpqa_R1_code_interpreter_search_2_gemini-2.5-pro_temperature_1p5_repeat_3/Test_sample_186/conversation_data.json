    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown to determine which stars are detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph.\n\n### **Step 1: Define Detectability Criteria**\n\n1.  **Instrument & Configuration**: ESPRESSO spectrograph coupled with a single 8-meter VLT Unit Telescope (1-UT mode).\n2.  **Observation Condition**: A signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel is achieved in a 1-hour (3600s) exposure.\n3.  **Observatory Location**: Paranal Observatory, Chile. This is crucial for determining which stars are visible in the sky.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine ESPRESSO's Limiting Magnitude**\n\nTo find the faintest star ESPRESSO can detect under these conditions, we consult its performance specifications. The ESPRESSO documentation and Exposure Time Calculator (ETC) are the primary sources. Based on public information from ESO (e.g., the ESPRESSO User Manual and scientific publications), for a standard solar-type star (G2V) observed in good conditions (seeing ~1\", airmass ~1.2) with one VLT UT for 1 hour, an S/N of 10 is achieved for stars with an apparent V-band magnitude (V) of approximately **16.5**.\n\nTherefore, a star is considered \"detectable\" if:\n1.  It is visible from Paranal Observatory.\n2.  Its apparent V-band magnitude is V ≤ 16.5.\n\n### **Step 3: Check Star Visibility from Paranal**\n\nParanal Observatory is located at a latitude of approximately **-24.6°**. A star's visibility depends on its declination (DEC). Stars that are too far north will never rise above the horizon, or will be too low for effective observation. A common rule of thumb is that a star should reach an altitude of at least 30° (corresponding to an airmass of 2). This means the star's declination must satisfy `DEC ≤ 90° - |Latitude| - (90°-30°) = |Latitude| + 30°` but an easier rule for observability is `|Latitude - Declination| ≤ 60°`.\n\n*   **Polaris (DEC ≈ +89.3°)**: `|-24.6° - 89.3°| = 113.9°`, which is much greater than 60°. Polaris is the North Star and is **not visible** from the southern hemisphere location of Paranal.\n*   **Canopus (DEC ≈ -52.7°)**: `|-24.6° - (-52.7°)| = 28.1°`, which is well within the 60° limit. Canopus is **visible**.\n*   **Stars c, d, e, f (DEC = 0°)**: `|-24.6° - 0°| = 24.6°`, which is well within the 60° limit. These stars on the celestial equator are **visible**.\n\n### **Step 4: Evaluate Each Star**\n\nWe will now check each star against our two criteria: visibility and apparent magnitude.\n\n**a) Canopus**\n*   **Visibility**: Visible.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude**: V = -0.74. This is extremely bright.\n*   **Conclusion**: Since -0.74 ≤ 16.5, Canopus is **detectable**.\n\n**b) Polaris**\n*   **Visibility**: Not visible from Paranal.\n*   **Conclusion**: Polaris is **not detectable**.\n\n**c) Star with Mv = 15 at 10 pc**\n*   **Visibility**: Visible (DEC = 0°).\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m)**: We calculate this from the absolute magnitude (M) and distance in parsecs (d) using the distance modulus formula: `m = M + 5 * log10(d/10)`.\n    *   m = 15 + 5 * log10(10/10) = 15 + 5 * log10(1) = 15 + 0 = 15.0.\n*   **Conclusion**: Since V = 15.0 ≤ 16.5, this star is **detectable**.\n\n**d) Star with Mv = 15 at 200 pc**\n*   **Visibility**: Visible (DEC = 0°).\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m)**:\n    *   m = 15 + 5 * log10(200/10) = 15 + 5 * log10(20) ≈ 15 + 5 * (1.301) = 15 + 6.505 = 21.5.\n*   **Conclusion**: Since V = 21.5 > 16.5, this star is too faint and thus **not detectable**.\n\n**e) Star with Mv = 15 at 5 pc**\n*   **Visibility**: Visible (DEC = 0°).\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m)**:\n    *   m = 15 + 5 * log10(5/10) = 15 + 5 * log10(0.5) ≈ 15 + 5 * (-0.301) = 15 - 1.505 = 13.5.\n*   **Conclusion**: Since V = 13.5 ≤ 16.5, this star is **detectable**.\n\n**f) Star with Mv = 15 at 50 pc**\n*   **Visibility**: Visible (DEC = 0°).\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m)**:\n    *   m = 15 + 5 * log10(50/10) = 15 + 5 * log10(5) ≈ 15 + 5 * (0.699) = 15 + 3.495 = 18.5.\n*   **Conclusion**: Since V = 18.5 > 16.5, this star is too faint and thus **not detectable**.\n\n### **Summary**\n\nLet's tally the results:\n*   a) Canopus: **Detectable**\n*   b) Polaris: **Not Detectable** (not visible)\n*   c) Star at 10 pc: **Detectable**\n*   d) Star at 200 pc: **Not Detectable** (too faint)\n*   e) Star at 5 pc: **Detectable**\n*   f) Star at 50 pc: **Not Detectable** (too faint)\n\nIn total, there are **3** detectable stars on the list.\n\n<<<A>>>"
