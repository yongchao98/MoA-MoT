    "This problem requires finding the electromagnetic potentials, namely the scalar potential V and the vector potential A, generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### Reasoning and Derivation:\n\n1.  **Retarded Potentials:** For a time-varying charge distribution `ρ(r', t)` and current distribution `J(r', t)`, the scalar and vector potentials at a position `r` and time `t` are given by the retarded potential formulas:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} dV'$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} dV'$\n    where `t_r` is the retarded time, defined by `t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c`. The retarded time accounts for the finite speed of light `c`; the field observed at `t` was emitted by the source at the earlier time `t_r`.\n\n2.  **Point Charge Formulation:** For a point charge `q` moving along a trajectory `s(t)`, the charge and current densities can be expressed using the Dirac delta function:\n    `ρ(r', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))`\n    `\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))`, where `\\vec{v}(t') = d\\vec{s}/dt'` is the velocity of the charge.\n\n3.  **Evaluating the Integral for V:** We substitute the charge density into the formula for `V`:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} dV'$\n    The integral is over the spatial coordinates `r'`. The delta function `δ³(r' - s(t_r))` is non-zero only when `r' = s(t_r)`. However, the retarded time `t_r` itself depends on `r'`, which makes the integration non-trivial.\n    `t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c`\n    A standard result from electromagnetism theory shows that evaluating this integral results in a correction factor in the denominator. The result of the integration is:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v}(t_r)}{c} \\cdot \\frac{\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}(t_r)}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}(t_r)|})} \\right]_{t_r}$\n    The subscript `t_r` means all quantities inside the bracket (s, v) are evaluated at the retarded time `t_r`.\n\n4.  **Applying the Problem's Notation:**\n    *   The position of the charge at the retarded time is `s(t_r)`.\n    *   The vector from the charge's retarded position to the field point is `d = r - s(t_r)`.\n    *   The magnitude of this vector is `d = |d| = |r - s(t_r)|`.\n    *   The velocity of the charge at the retarded time is `v = v(t_r)`.\n    *   The retarded time condition is `t = t_r + d/c`.\n\n    Let's substitute this notation into the expression for `V`:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c} \\cdot \\frac{\\vec{d}}{d})} \\right] = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n    Multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\n5.  **Evaluating the Integral for A:** The process for the vector potential `A` is analogous.\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{q \\vec{v}(t_r) \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} dV'$\n    The integration yields a similar result, but with the velocity `v(t_r)` in the numerator:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q \\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{t_r}$\n    Again, multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc \\vec{v}}{d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\n6.  **Comparing with the Options:**\n    The derived expressions are:\n    $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n    These expressions match exactly with option C. Let's check the other options:\n    *   A) and B) use the static potential form `q/(4πε₀r)`, which is incorrect as it neglects retardation effects.\n    *   D) has a `+` sign in the denominator (`dc + d.v`), which corresponds to advanced potentials (fields arriving before they are emitted), which are generally discarded as unphysical. The correct derivation yields a `-` sign.\n\nTherefore, option C correctly states the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<C>>>"
