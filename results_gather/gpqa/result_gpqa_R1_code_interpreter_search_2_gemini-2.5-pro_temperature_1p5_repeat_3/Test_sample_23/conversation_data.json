    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z.**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon, a product of hydrogenation, and does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (an alkane or a cycloalkane).\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. Let's determine the empirical formula of Z.\n    *   Mass fraction of Hydrogen = (mass of H) / (total mass) = 0.1428\n    *   Mass fraction of Carbon = 1 - 0.1428 = 0.8572\n    *   Ratio of moles of atoms (H:C) = (0.1428 / 1.008) : (0.8572 / 12.011) ≈ 0.1417 : 0.07137 ≈ 2 : 1.\n    *   The empirical formula of Z is CH₂.\n    *   For a saturated hydrocarbon, the general formula CₙH₂ₙ corresponds to a cycloalkane. Let's verify the mass percentage for a cycloalkane (CₙH₂ₙ).\n        Mass % H = (2n * 1) / (12n + 2n) * 100% = 2n / 14n * 100% = (1/7) * 100% ≈ 14.2857%. This matches the given value perfectly.\n    *   So, Z is a cycloalkane. The problem states that Z is widely used as a solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). We will proceed with this assumption and verify it later. So, Z = Cyclohexane.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y.**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This means the components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only one substance, Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   Z (cyclohexane) is itself a constituent of mixture Y.\n    *   Let the other component of Y be W. Since hydrogenating Y gives only cyclohexane, hydrogenating W must also yield cyclohexane.\n    *   W must not decolorize bromine water, so it must be saturated or aromatic.\n    *   If W were a saturated isomer of cyclohexane (like methylcyclopentane), its hydrogenation to cyclohexane would involve \"severe conditions\" as stated. However, the most famous disproportionation reaction in this context points to another option.\n    *   Consider the classic disproportionation of cyclohexene or cyclohexadienes on a platinum catalyst. The products are cyclohexane (the most hydrogenated C6 ring) and benzene (the most dehydrogenated C6 ring).\n    *   Let's hypothesize that Y is a mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆).\n    *   Check if this fits:\n        *   Both are liquids at room temperature.\n        *   They can form an equimolar mixture.\n        *   Cyclohexane (saturated) and benzene (aromatic) do not decolorize bromine water. This fits.\n        *   Hydrogenation of Y: Cyclohexane is unchanged. Benzene hydrogenates to cyclohexane (C₆H₆ + 3H₂ → C₆H₁₂). The sole product is cyclohexane (Z). This fits perfectly.\n        *   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of Y. This fits.\n    *   This hypothesis (Y = {Cyclohexane, Benzene}) is very strong.\n\n3.  **Identify the Components of Mixture X and the Reaction.**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. This implies the presence of C=C double bonds.\n    *   The compounds in X must not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   Hydrogenation of X gives only cyclohexane. This means both compounds in X have a C₆ ring skeleton.\n    *   Possible C₆ unsaturated cyclic compounds without conjugated bonds are Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈). (Cyclohexa-1,3-diene is conjugated).\n    *   Let's assume X is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexene and cyclohexa-1,4-diene.\n    *   The reaction is a disproportionation (specifically, a hydrogen transfer) from X to Y. Let's see if we can balance a reaction where an equimolar mixture of reactants produces an equimolar mixture of products.\n        Reactants: 1 mole Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) + 1 mole Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈)\n        Products: Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)\n    *   Let's balance the reaction:\n        a C₆H₁₀ + b C₆H₈ → c C₆H₁₂ + d C₆H₆\n    *   We know the reactant mixture X is equimolar, so a=b. We also know the product mixture Y is equimolar, so c=d.\n    *   Let a=b=1. Total atoms on the left: C₁₂, H₁₈.\n    *   Let c=d=1. Total atoms on the right: C₁₂ (from C₆+C₆), H₁₈ (from H₁₂+H₆).\n    *   The equation balances perfectly:\n        C₆H₁₀ (Cyclohexene) + C₆H₈ (Cyclohexa-1,4-diene) --(Pt/Heat)--> C₆H₁₂ (Cyclohexane) + C₆H₆ (Benzene)\n    *   In this reaction, the cyclohexadiene loses 2 hydrogens (oxidation) to become benzene, and the cyclohexene gains 2 hydrogens (reduction) to become cyclohexane. This is a classic hydrogen transfer disproportionation.\n    *   All conditions are met. Mixture X is {Cyclohexene, Cyclohexa-1,4-diene}.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Answer.**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This refers to the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each compound.\n    *   Liquid 1: Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Liquid 2: Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈) has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
