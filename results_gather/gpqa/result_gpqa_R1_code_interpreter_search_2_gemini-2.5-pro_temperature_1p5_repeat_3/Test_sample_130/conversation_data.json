    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants**\n    *   The first reactant is described as a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene, which is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride has a highly symmetric structure, evidenced by its NMR spectra: a single peak at 7 ppm in the ¹H NMR and two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons) in the ¹³C NMR. This perfectly matches the structure and spectral data for **maleic anhydride**. The two alkene protons are chemically equivalent, as are the two alkene carbons and the two carbonyl carbons.\n    *   The second reactant is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a diene with a C₅ ring structure. The carbons at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4 each have a methyl group. The carbon at position 5 is a CH₂ group.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction and Products**\n    *   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a bicyclic adduct.\n    *   This reaction can form two possible stereoisomers: the *endo* product and the *exo* product. The terms *endo* and *exo* describe the stereochemistry of the anhydride ring relative to the main bicyclic framework.\n\n3.  **Determine the Major and Minor Products**\n    *   The **endo rule** generally predicts that the major product of a Diels-Alder reaction is the *endo* isomer. This preference arises from favorable secondary orbital interactions in the transition state.\n    *   However, the endo rule can be overridden by significant steric hindrance. In this case, the diene has four bulky methyl groups. In the *endo* transition state, the anhydride ring tucks underneath the diene, leading to significant steric repulsion with the methyl groups.\n    *   The *exo* transition state, where the anhydride ring points away from the diene, is sterically much less hindered.\n    *   Therefore, due to the large steric bulk of the tetramethyl-substituted diene, the **exo product is expected to be the major product**, and the *endo* product will be the minor one. This reversal of the usual selectivity is key to solving the problem.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Structures and NOESY Proximities**\n    *   A NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) experiment shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å).\n    *   The question states that a cross-peak is present in the spectrum of the major product but absent or weak in the spectrum of the minor product. This means we must find a pair of protons that are close in the *exo* isomer but far apart in the *endo* isomer.\n\n5.  **Visualize the 3D Structures**\n    *   **Major Product (*exo* isomer):** The anhydride ring is on the *exo* face of the bicyclic system (on the same side as the C7 methylene bridge). This means the two protons on the anhydride part of the molecule (let's call them **H_bridgehead**) are pointing \"down\" into the *endo* face. The four methyl groups are divided into two types: two on the C=C double bond (**Me_alkene**) and two on the bridgehead carbons (**Me_bridgehead**). The **Me_alkene** groups also occupy the sterically crowded *endo* face.\n    *   **Minor Product (*endo* isomer):** The anhydride ring is on the *endo* face. The **H_bridgehead** protons are pointing \"up\" into the *exo* face. The **Me_alkene** groups are still on the *endo* face.\n\n6.  **Identify the Differentiating NOE**\n    *   In the **major (*exo*) product**, the **H_bridgehead** protons and the **Me_alkene** groups are both on the *endo* face of the molecule. They are spatially close, so a strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between them.\n    *   In the **minor (*endo*) product**, the **H_bridgehead** protons are on the *exo* face, while the **Me_alkene** groups are on the *endo* face. They are on opposite sides of the molecular framework and thus far apart. No NOESY cross-peak is expected.\n    *   Therefore, the cross-peak that is present in the major product and absent in the minor product is the one between **H_bridgehead** and **Me_alkene**.\n\n7.  **Assign NMR Signals and Match with Options**\n    *   We need to assign the chemical shifts given in the options to the protons we've identified.\n    *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** These are the **H_bridgehead** protons. They are adjacent to two carbonyl groups, which deshields them significantly. Their equivalence leads to a singlet.\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** These are the **Me_alkene** groups. Methyl groups on a double bond (vinylic methyls) typically resonate around 1.6-1.8 ppm.\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** These are the **Me_bridgehead** groups. Methyl groups on saturated carbons are more shielded and resonate further upfield.\n    *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This is one of the protons on the C7 bridge.\n\n    The decisive cross-peak connects **H_bridgehead** (~3.5 ppm) and **Me_alkene** (~1.7 ppm). This corresponds to:\n    **A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n\n    This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
