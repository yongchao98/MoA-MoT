    "**1. Analysis of the Product from NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's deduce the structure of the product formed in the reaction using the provided NMR data. The molecular formula of the starting material, Compound X, is C11H12O. Since the reaction is an isomerization (a rearrangement catalyzed by a base, DABCO), the product will have the same molecular formula, C11H12O.\n\n*   **Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):** For C11H12O, DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6.\n    A benzene ring accounts for 4 DoU. The remaining 2 DoU suggest a combination like a C=O and a C=C bond, or two C=C bonds, or a C≡C bond.\n\n*   **¹³C NMR Analysis:**\n    *   δ 197.7 (1C, s): This chemical shift is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon (C=O), specifically a ketone or aldehyde conjugated with a double bond or aromatic ring. This accounts for 1 DoU.\n    *   δ 126.9 - 144.1: Six signals in this region corresponding to 8 carbons (2C, 1C, 2C, 1C, 1C, 1C). This indicates an aromatic ring and a C=C double bond. A benzene ring has 6 carbons. The remaining two carbons must be from a C=C bond. This accounts for 4 (ring) + 1 (C=C) = 5 DoU.\n    *   Total DoU from ¹³C NMR = 1 (C=O) + 4 (ring) + 1 (C=C) = 6. This matches the calculation from the formula.\n    *   δ 21.3 and δ 28.4: Two signals in the aliphatic region, each corresponding to a methyl group.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   δ 2.28 (3H, s) and 2.31 (3H, s): Two singlets, each integrating to 3H. These are two methyl (CH₃) groups not adjacent to any protons.\n    *   δ 7.08 (2H, d) and 7.71 (2H, d): This AA'BB' pattern is classic for a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   δ 6.75 (1H, d) and 7.68 (1H, d): Two doublets, each integrating to 1H. These are two protons on a double bond, coupled to each other (vinylic protons). The trans configuration is likely, given the large difference in chemical shifts.\n\n*   **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n    1.  We have a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    2.  We have two methyl groups. One is likely attached to the benzene ring (a tolyl group), and the other is part of the rest of the structure. The chemical shift of ~2.3 ppm is typical for both a methyl group on a benzene ring (Ar-CH₃) and a methyl group next to a carbonyl (acetyl group, -COCH₃).\n    3.  The remaining fragments are a C=C double bond (with two H's) and a ketone C=O.\n    4.  Let's assemble these pieces: a *p*-tolyl group (p-CH₃C₆H₄-), an acetyl group (-COCH₃), and a C=C double bond (-CH=CH-).\n    5.  The only way to connect these to satisfy valency and match the NMR is the structure for **(E)-4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n\n        Structure: p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃\n\n    *   **NMR check for this structure:**\n        *   **¹H NMR:** One methyl singlet for p-CH₃ (~2.3 ppm), one methyl singlet for -COCH₃ (~2.3 ppm), two doublets for the p-substituted ring, and two doublets for the -CH=CH- group. This perfectly matches the provided data: `p-CH₃` and `-COCH₃` are at 2.31/2.28, ring protons at 7.08/7.71, and vinylic protons at 6.75/7.68.\n        *   **¹³C NMR:** The structure has 11 carbons: 2 methyls, 1 ketone, 6 aromatic (4 CH, 2 quaternary), 2 vinylic. This matches the carbon count and types from the ¹³C spectrum.\n\n**2. Identifying the Reaction and Reactant (Compound X)**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Compound X (C11H12O) is reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO), a non-nucleophilic base, at high temperature (403 K). This setup is characteristic of a base-catalyzed isomerization reaction. Specifically, it points to the rearrangement of an allylic epoxide into an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound.\n\n*   **Reactant Structure:** We need to find the allylic epoxide isomer of the product that would rearrange to form (E)-4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one. The general transformation is:\n    R-CH=CH-CH(O)-CHR'  →  R-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₂R'\n\n    Applying this to our product:\n    *   Product: (p-CH₃-C₆H₄)-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃\n    *   Matching the pattern, R = p-CH₃-C₆H₄-\n    *   The group -CH₂R' from the general mechanism corresponds to the methyl group (-CH₃) in our product.\n    *   Therefore, -CH₂R' = -CH₃, which implies that R' = H.\n\n    Substituting these back into the general reactant structure, we get the structure for Compound X:\n    *   Compound X = (p-CH₃-C₆H₄)-CH=CH-CH(O)-CH₂\n    *   The name of this compound is **2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane**.\n\n**3. Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   A) 2-styrylepoxide: C₁₀H₁₀O. Incorrect molecular formula.\n*   B) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane: p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂. This matches our deduced structure for Compound X.\n*   C) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane: Rearrangement would lead to a different product skeleton that does not match the NMR data.\n*   D) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane: Rearrangement would lead to an ethyl ketone (-COCH₂CH₃), not a methyl ketone, and it's missing the methyl group on the phenyl ring.\n\nTherefore, Compound X must be 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n<<<B>>>"
