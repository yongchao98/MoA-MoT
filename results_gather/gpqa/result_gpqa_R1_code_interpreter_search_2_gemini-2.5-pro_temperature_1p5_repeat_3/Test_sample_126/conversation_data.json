    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the Reactant and Reaction Conditions**\n    *   The starting molecule is 5-butylnona-2,6-diene.\n    *   Let's draw its structure based on the IUPAC name.\n        *   \"nona\" means a 9-carbon parent chain.\n        *   \"-2,6-diene\" means there are double bonds starting at carbon 2 and carbon 6.\n        *   \"5-butyl\" means a butyl group (-CH2CH2CH2CH3) is attached to carbon 5.\n    *   The structure is:\n        `CH3–CH=CH–CH2–CH(C4H9)–CH=CH–CH2–CH3`\n        Let's number the carbons of the main chain:\n        `1CH3–2CH=3CH–4CH2–5CH(Butyl)–6CH=7CH–8CH2–9CH3`\n    *   The reaction condition is \"heated\". When a molecule containing a 1,5-diene system is heated, it can undergo a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement known as the Cope rearrangement.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the 1,5-Diene System for the Cope Rearrangement**\n    *   A Cope rearrangement involves a system with the skeleton `C=C–C–C–C=C`.\n    *   In our starting molecule, the carbons from C2 to C7 form such a system: `2C=3C – 4C – 5C – 6C=7C`.\n    *   This system can be viewed as two allyl groups connected by a sigma bond. The two allyl fragments are `(C2=C3–C4)` and `(C5–C6=C7)`. The sigma bond connecting them is the C4–C5 bond.\n\n*   **Step 3: Perform the [3,3]-Sigmatropic Rearrangement**\n    *   The Cope rearrangement involves the following electronic shifts in a concerted mechanism, typically through a six-membered, chair-like transition state:\n        1.  The sigma (σ) bond between C4 and C5 breaks.\n        2.  A new sigma (σ) bond forms between C2 and C7.\n        3.  The pi (π) bond between C2 and C3 moves to form a new π bond between C3 and C4.\n        4.  The pi (π) bond between C6 and C7 moves to form a new π bond between C5 and C6.\n\n*   **Step 4: Determine the Structure of the Product**\n    *   Let's trace the connectivity of the carbon atoms and their substituents in the product.\n    *   The substituents remain attached to their original carbons:\n        *   The methyl group (C1) remains attached to C2.\n        *   The butyl group remains attached to C5.\n        *   The ethyl group (C8 and C9) remains attached to C7.\n    *   The new molecular skeleton is formed by the new connections. Let's sketch the product structure based on the new bonding:\n        *   C4 is now double-bonded to C3. C3 is single-bonded to C2.\n        *   C2 is now single-bonded to C7 (the new bond) and also to C1 (methyl).\n        *   C7 is now single-bonded to C2, C6, and C8 (part of the ethyl group).\n        *   C6 is now double-bonded to C5.\n        *   C5 is attached to the butyl group.\n\n    *   Let's assemble this information into a single structure:\n                         CH3 (from C1)\n                         |\n            CH2=CH — CH — CH — CH=CH—CH2CH2CH2CH3 (Butyl group on C5)\n            (C4) (C3)  (C2)  (C7) (C6) (C5)\n                               |\n                               CH2CH3 (from C8, C9)\n\n*   **Step 5: Name the Product Molecule using IUPAC Rules**\n    1.  **Find the longest carbon chain** that contains the principal functional groups (the two double bonds).\n        Let's trace the chain starting from C4 and going through C3-C2-C7-C6-C5 and into the butyl group.\n        The chain is: `C4 - C3 - C2 - C7 - C6 - C5 - C(butyl-1) - C(butyl-2) - C(butyl-3) - C(butyl-4)`.\n        The total length is 1+1+1+1+1+1+4 = 10 carbons. The parent alkane is decane. Since it has two double bonds, it is a **decadiene**.\n\n    2.  **Number the parent chain** to give the double bonds the lowest possible locants.\n        *   **Numbering from left to right:** `C4` is carbon #1.\n            `1C H2= 2C H– 3C H(CH3)– 4C H(CH2CH3)– 5C H= 6C H– 7C H2– 8C H2– 9C H2– 10C H3`\n            The double bonds start at carbons 1 and 5. So, it's a **deca-1,5-diene**.\n            The substituents are a methyl group on carbon 3 and an ethyl group on carbon 4.\n\n        *   **Numbering from right to left:** The end of the butyl chain is carbon #1.\n            The double bonds would be at positions 5 and 9 (`deca-5,9-diene`). The set of locants (5,9) is higher than (1,5). Therefore, the first direction of numbering is correct.\n\n    3.  **Assemble the full name:** Combine the substituent names (in alphabetical order) and the parent chain name.\n        `4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene`\n\n*   **Step 6: Compare the Result with the Given Options**\n    *   A) 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene - This matches our derived name.\n    *   B) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene - Incorrect chain length and double bond positions.\n    *   C) 5-ethylundeca-2,6-diene - Incorrect parent chain length (11 carbons).\n    *   D) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene - Identical to B and incorrect.\n\nThe product formed is 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
