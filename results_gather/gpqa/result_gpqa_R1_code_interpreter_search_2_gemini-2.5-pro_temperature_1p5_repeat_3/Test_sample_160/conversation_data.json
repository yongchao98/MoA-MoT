    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n1.  **Understanding Mean Free Path (λ):** The mean free path is the average distance a particle travels between successive collisions. It is inversely proportional to both the number density of target particles (n) and the collision cross-section (σ). The general formula is λ = 1 / (n * σ).\n\n2.  **Defining λ1:**\n    *   λ1 represents the mean free path of the gas molecules themselves.\n    *   The collision is between one gas molecule and another.\n    *   The collision cross-section, in this case, is related to the physical size (kinetic diameter, 'd') of the gas molecules. The standard formula from kinetic theory for identical molecules is:\n        λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * π * d²)\n    *   Here, 'n' is the number density of the gas molecules, and the term `π * d²` represents the geometric cross-section for a collision. The `√2` factor accounts for the relative motion of the colliding molecules.\n\n3.  **Defining λ2:**\n    *   λ2 represents the mean free path of the high-energy electrons from the beam as they travel through the residual gas.\n    *   The collision (more accurately, a scattering event) is between an electron and a gas molecule.\n    *   The formula for this mean free path is:\n        λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_e-gas)\n    *   Here, 'n' is the same number density of gas molecules, but 'σ_e-gas' is the scattering cross-section for an electron interacting with a gas molecule.\n\n4.  **Comparing the Collision Cross-Sections:**\n    *   The crucial difference between the two scenarios lies in the nature of the collision and thus the size of the collision cross-section.\n    *   **Gas-Gas Collision (for λ1):** This is like a collision between two relatively large, \"soft\" spheres. The cross-section (related to πd²) is determined by their Van der Waals radii.\n    *   **Electron-Gas Scattering (for λ2):** The electron is a point-like particle. The accelerating voltage of 1000 kV makes it extremely energetic and fast (relativistic). From the perspective of such a fast electron, an atom or molecule consists of a tiny, dense nucleus and a sparse electron cloud, with vast amounts of \"empty\" space. A significant scattering event (a change in the electron's trajectory) only happens if the electron passes very close to the nucleus or an inner-shell electron. Therefore, the effective \"target area\" or scattering cross-section (σ_e-gas) presented by a gas molecule to a high-energy electron is *much smaller* than the physical cross-section (πd²) for molecule-molecule collisions.\n\n5.  **Drawing the Conclusion:**\n    *   We have established that σ_e-gas << (√2 * π * d²).\n    *   We are comparing λ1 = 1 / (n * √2 * π * d²) and λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_e-gas).\n    *   Since the number density 'n' is the same in both denominators, and the cross-section term in the denominator for λ2 (σ_e-gas) is much smaller than the cross-section term for λ1 (√2 * π * d²), the resulting mean free path λ2 must be much larger than λ1.\n    *   So, the physical conclusion is λ2 >> λ1.\n\n6.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: This states λ2 is larger than λ1 but limits it to a very small increase. This contradicts our finding that λ2 should be *much* larger than λ1.\n    *   B) λ2 < λ1: This is the opposite of our conclusion.\n    *   C) λ2 = λ1: This would imply the cross-sections are the same, which is physically incorrect.\n    *   D) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: This statement is fully consistent with our conclusion that λ2 >> λ1. If λ2 is much larger than λ1, it is certainly greater than 1.22 times λ1. This is the only option that correctly reflects the physical reality of the situation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
