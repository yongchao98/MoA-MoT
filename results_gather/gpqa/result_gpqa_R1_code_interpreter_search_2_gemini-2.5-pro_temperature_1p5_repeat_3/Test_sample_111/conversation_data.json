    "This is a quantum mechanics problem involving a two-level system (spin-1/2 electron). Let's break down the solution step-by-step.\n\n**1. Normalize the initial state |alpha>**\n\nThe given state is proportional to `(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>`. Let's call this unnormalized state `|alpha_un>`. In the standard basis where `|up> = [1, 0]` and `|down> = [0, 1]`, the state vector is `[1+i, 2-i]`.\n\nTo normalize the state, we need to divide it by its norm. The squared norm is the inner product of the state with itself:\n`<alpha_un|alpha_un> = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2`\n`|1+i|^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2`\n`|2-i|^2 = 2^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 = 5`\nSo, the squared norm is `2 + 5 = 7`.\nThe normalization constant is `N = 1/sqrt(7)`.\n\nThe normalized state `|alpha>` is:\n`|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>]`\nOr in vector form: `|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [1+i, 2-i]`\n\n**2. Define the operator A and find its eigenstates and eigenvalues**\n\nThe problem states that the matrix elements of operator A are `Aij = hbar/2` if `i` is different from `j`, and 0 otherwise. This gives the matrix representation in the `{|up>, |down>}` basis:\n`A = [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]] = (hbar/2) * [[1, 0], [0, 1]]`\nThis is proportional to the Pauli-X matrix, `A = (hbar/2) * sigma_x`.\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (`lambda`), we solve the characteristic equation `det(A - lambda*I) = 0`:\n`det([[ -lambda, hbar/2 ], [ hbar/2, -lambda ]]) = lambda^2 - (hbar/2)^2 = 0`\nThis gives two eigenvalues:\n`lambda_1 = +hbar/2`\n`lambda_2 = -hbar/2`\n\nNow, we find the corresponding normalized eigenvectors:\n*   For `lambda_1 = +hbar/2`: The eigenvector is `|v1> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, 1] = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> + |down>)`. This is the spin-up state along the x-axis, `|+x>`.\n*   For `lambda_2 = -hbar/2`: The eigenvector is `|v2> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, -1] = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> - |down>)`. This is the spin-down state along the x-axis, `|-x>`.\n\n**3. Calculate the probabilities of measurement**\n\nThe probability of measuring an eigenvalue is the squared modulus of the projection of the state `|alpha>` onto the corresponding eigenvector.\n\nProbability of measuring `lambda_1 = +hbar/2` is `P1 = |<v1|alpha>|^2`.\n`<v1|alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, 1] . (1/sqrt(7)) * [1+i, 2-i]`\n`= (1/sqrt(14)) * [1*(1+i) + 1*(2-i)]`\n`= (1/sqrt(14)) * (1 + i + 2 - i) = 3/sqrt(14)`\n`P1 = |3/sqrt(14)|^2 = 9/14`\n\nProbability of measuring `lambda_2 = -hbar/2` is `P2 = |<v2|alpha>|^2`.\n`<v2|alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, -1] . (1/sqrt(7)) * [1+i, 2-i]`\n`= (1/sqrt(14)) * [1*(1+i) - 1*(2-i)]`\n`= (1/sqrt(14)) * (1 + i - 2 + i) = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)`\n`P2 = |(-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)|^2 = ((-1)^2 + 2^2) / 14 = (1 + 4) / 14 = 5/14`\n\nAs a check, `P1 + P2 = 9/14 + 5/14 = 14/14 = 1`.\nConverting to decimals:\n`P1 = 9/14 ≈ 0.6428 ≈ 0.64`\n`P2 = 5/14 ≈ 0.3571 ≈ 0.36`\n\n**4. Calculate the average (expectation) value of A**\n\nThe expectation value `<A>` can be calculated in two ways:\n\nMethod 1: Sum of eigenvalues weighted by their probabilities.\n`<A> = lambda_1 * P1 + lambda_2 * P2`\n`<A> = (+hbar/2)*(9/14) + (-hbar/2)*(5/14)`\n`<A> = (hbar/2) * (9/14 - 5/14) = (hbar/2) * (4/14) = (hbar/2) * (2/7) = hbar/7`\n\nMethod 2: Using the formula `<A> = <alpha|A|alpha>`.\n`A|alpha> = (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * (1/sqrt(7)) * [1+i, 2-i]`\n`= (hbar / (2*sqrt(7))) * [2-i, 1+i]`\n`<alpha|A|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [1-i, 2+i] . (hbar / (2*sqrt(7))) * [2-i, 1+i]`\n`= (hbar/14) * [(1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i)]`\n`= (hbar/14) * [(2 - 3i - 1) + (2 + 3i - 1)]`\n`= (hbar/14) * [(1 - 3i) + (1 + 3i)] = (hbar/14) * 2 = hbar/7`\n\nThe probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value is `hbar/7`. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
