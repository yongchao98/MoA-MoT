    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the System:** We have an uncharged spherical conductor with a spherical cavity. A point charge +q is placed inside this cavity. We need to find the electric field at a point P outside the conductor.\n\n2.  **Charge Induction:** The presence of the charge +q inside the cavity will cause the mobile charges (electrons) within the conductor to redistribute.\n    *   **Inner Surface:** The positive charge +q will attract negative charges. A total charge of -q will be induced on the inner surface (the wall of the cavity). This is a direct consequence of Gauss's Law. If we imagine a Gaussian surface just outside the cavity but still within the conducting material, the electric field must be zero. For the field to be zero, the total charge enclosed by this Gaussian surface must be zero. Therefore, the induced charge on the inner surface must be exactly -q to cancel the +q charge inside the cavity.\n    *   **Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially electrically neutral (uncharged). Since a charge of -q has been induced on the inner surface, a charge of +q must appear somewhere else to maintain the overall neutrality of the conductor. This +q charge will reside on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n3.  **Electric Field Superposition:** The total electric field at the external point P is the vector sum of the fields produced by all charges:\n    *   The original point charge +q inside the cavity.\n    *   The induced charge -q on the inner surface of the cavity.\n    *   The induced charge +q on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n4.  **Electrostatic Shielding (Faraday Cage Effect):** A crucial principle of electrostatics is that a conducting shell shields its exterior from the electric fields of charges inside it. The induced charge (-q) on the inner surface arranges itself in such a way that it perfectly cancels the electric field of the charge (+q) for all points *outside the cavity*.\n    *   Therefore, the net electric field at point P due to the combination of the point charge +q and the induced charge -q on the cavity wall is zero.\n    *   This means the electric field at P is solely determined by the charge on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n5.  **Field from the Outer Surface Charge:** We have a charge of +q on the outer surface of the spherical conductor. How is this charge distributed?\n    *   Due to the shielding effect, the charges on the outer surface are not affected by the specific location of the charge +q or the cavity inside. They only know that a total charge of +q needs to be accommodated.\n    *   For an isolated spherical conductor, the charge on its surface will distribute itself uniformly to achieve the lowest electrostatic potential energy.\n    *   So, we have a uniformly distributed charge of +q on the outer spherical surface of radius R.\n\n6.  **Calculating the External Field:** The electric field at an external point due to a uniformly charged spherical shell is given by the same formula as for a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere (a result from Gauss's Law).\n    *   Total charge on the outer surface = +q.\n    *   The center of the spherical conductor is at a distance L from the point P.\n    *   The magnitude of the electric field at P is therefore:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{Q_{total}}{(\\text{distance from center})^2}$\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n7.  **Conclusion and Distractors:** The distances `l` and `s`, and the angle `\\theta` describe the internal configuration and the position of P relative to the cavity. However, due to electrostatic shielding, these details are irrelevant for calculating the field *outside* the conductor. The external field only depends on the total charge induced on the outer surface (+q) and the distance from the center of the conductor (L).\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ (Incorrect)\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$ (Incorrect)\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$ (Correct)\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ (Incorrect)\n\nThe correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
