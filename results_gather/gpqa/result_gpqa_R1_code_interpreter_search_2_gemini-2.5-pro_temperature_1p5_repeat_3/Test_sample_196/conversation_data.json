  "response_list": [
    "*   **Step 1: Determine the structure of Compound X from the provided spectroscopic data.**\n\n    *   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   The broad absorption in the range of 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n        *   The strong absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O stretching vibration, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n        *   The absorptions at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ are typical for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n        *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet far downfield is the classic signal for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). This confirms the IR analysis.\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons at 8.0 ppm are deshielded, meaning they are adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group. The protons at 7.2 ppm are more shielded, meaning they are adjacent to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n        *   **Alkyl Group Analysis:** Let's assemble the alkyl chain from the remaining signals.\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet indicates a -CH₃ group adjacent to a -CH₂ group. This is one end of the chain: `CH₃-CH₂-`.\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for two protons fits the -CH₂- group next to the `CH₃-` and also adjacent to another group. Our chain is now: `CH₃-CH₂-CH-`.\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for three protons indicates another -CH₃ group adjacent to a -CH group.\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for one proton is the -CH group. This proton is split by the adjacent -CH₂ group (2H) and the other -CH₃ group (3H). It is also benzylic (attached to the aromatic ring), which explains its downfield shift to 2.9 ppm.\n            *   **Assembling the alkyl group:** Combining the pieces gives `CH₃-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-`. This is a **sec-butyl** group.\n    *   **Structure of Compound X:** Based on the analysis, Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. This structure is consistent with all the IR and NMR data. It matches option (B).\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the reaction and predict the product.**\n\n    *   **Reaction:** Compound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) is reacted with **red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI)**.\n    *   **Reagent Function:** Red P / HI is a powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce carboxylic acids completely to their corresponding alkanes. Specifically, the carboxyl group (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃). Other functional groups like aldehydes and ketones are also reduced to alkanes by this reagent.\n    *   **Transformation:**\n        *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\n        *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at position 1 will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n        *   The sec-butyl group at position 4 and the aromatic ring will remain unchanged.\n    *   **Final Product:** The product will be **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Match the predicted product with the given options.**\n\n    *   A) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This matches our predicted product.\n    *   B) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material, Compound X.\n    *   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - This has an incorrect alkyl group (isobutyl instead of sec-butyl).\n    *   D) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - This structure is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
