    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Concepts:** The question involves two key astronomical concepts:\n    *   **Redshift (z):** The stretching of light's wavelength as it travels from a distant object moving away from us. The formula relating the emitted (rest) wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{emitted}}$) and the observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}$) is:\n        $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{\\text{emitted}} \\times (1 + z)$\n    *   **Atmospheric Window:** The Earth's atmosphere is not transparent to all wavelengths of light. It blocks most ultraviolet (UV), X-ray, and gamma-ray radiation. Ground-based optical telescopes can only observe light within the \"optical window,\" which has a specific short-wavelength (blue/UV) cutoff.\n\n2.  **Gather the Given Information:**\n    *   The absorption line is the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) line of neutral hydrogen.\n    *   The rest wavelength of the Lyα line ($\\lambda_{\\text{emitted}}$) is approximately 1216 Angstroms (Å). This is in the far-ultraviolet part of the spectrum.\n    *   The observation is done with **ground-based optical telescopes**.\n\n3.  **Determine the Constraint:** For a spectral line to be detected by a ground-based optical telescope, its observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}$) must be long enough to pass through the Earth's atmosphere. The atmosphere becomes increasingly opaque below about 3500-4000 Å due to absorption by ozone and other molecules. A practical lower limit for efficient astronomical observation from the ground is typically around 3500 Å. Therefore, the redshifted Lyα line must have a wavelength $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} \\ge 3500$ Å.\n\n4.  **Set up the Calculation:** We want to find the *lower limit* on the redshift, so we will use the minimum possible observed wavelength, which is the atmospheric cutoff.\n    *   $\\lambda_{\\text{emitted}} = 1216$ Å\n    *   $\\lambda_{\\text{obs (min)}} \\approx 3500$ Å\n    *   We need to solve the redshift formula for z:\n        $z = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}}{\\lambda_{\\text{emitted}}} - 1$\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    Let's calculate the minimum redshift ($z_{\\text{min}}$) using a typical atmospheric cutoff.\n\n```python\n# The rest wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line in Angstroms.\nlambda_emitted = 1216\n\n# The approximate short-wavelength cutoff for ground-based optical telescopes in Angstroms.\n# We'll use 3500 A as a reasonable value for the beginning of the observable window.\nlambda_obs_min = 3500\n\n# Calculate the minimum redshift z.\nz_min = (lambda_obs_min / lambda_emitted) - 1\n\nprint(z_min)\n```\n```\n1.8782894736842104\n```\nThe calculated minimum redshift is approximately 1.88.\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    A) 3\n    B) 1.9\n    C) 1.2\n    D) 2.4\n\n    The calculated value of ~1.88 is very close to 1.9. This confirms that for the Lyα line at 1216 Å to be redshifted past the atmospheric cutoff and become observable, a redshift of approximately 1.9 is required.\n\n<<<B>>>",
