    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates that the molecular weight of the compound, using the most common isotopes, is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 has an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak (100%). The ratio of M+ to M+2 is approximately 100:32, which simplifies to about 3:1. This specific isotopic pattern is a definitive indicator for the presence of a single **chlorine atom** in the molecule. The two major isotopes of chlorine are ³⁵Cl (~75% abundance) and ³⁷Cl (~25% abundance), which accounts for this 3:1 ratio for the M+ and M+2 peaks.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is the classic signature of an **O-H stretch from a carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The significant broadening is due to strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is characteristic of a **C=O (carbonyl) stretch**. Its position is consistent with the carbonyl group within an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Data:**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically 10-13 ppm) is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid**. The 's' indicates it's a singlet, and '1H' confirms it represents a single proton.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region (typically 7-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets ('d'), each integrating to two protons ('2H'), is the classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The two protons ortho to one substituent are equivalent and split by their neighbors, and the two protons ortho to the other substituent are also equivalent and split by their neighbors, resulting in two distinct doublets.\n\n**4. Conclusion and Structure Determination:**\n\nLet's synthesize all the information:\n*   MS shows a molecule with MW 156 containing one chlorine atom.\n*   IR and NMR confirm the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   NMR shows that the functional groups are attached to a benzene ring in a para (1,4) arrangement.\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound is a benzoic acid with a chlorine atom substituted at the para position. This is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n**Let's check the proposed structure against the options:**\n\n*   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n    *   **Structure:** A carboxylic acid and a chlorine atom are para to each other on a benzene ring.\n    *   **Formula:** C₇H₅ClO₂. Molecular Weight = (7*12)+(5*1)+35+(2*16) = 156. (Matches MS)\n    *   **Functional Groups:** It is a carboxylic acid. (Matches IR and NMR)\n    *   **Substitution Pattern:** It is a para-substituted ring. (Matches NMR)\n    *   **This is a perfect match.**\n\n*   **B) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. The NMR aromatic pattern would be much more complex (3 distinct protons).\n\n*   **C) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is an acyl chloride/ester, not a carboxylic acid. It lacks the O-H group seen in the IR and the acidic proton seen in the NMR.\n\n*   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho*-substituted ring. This would result in a more complex aromatic NMR spectrum with four distinct signals, not the simple two-doublet pattern that was observed.\n\nThe only structure consistent with all the spectroscopic evidence is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<A>>>"
