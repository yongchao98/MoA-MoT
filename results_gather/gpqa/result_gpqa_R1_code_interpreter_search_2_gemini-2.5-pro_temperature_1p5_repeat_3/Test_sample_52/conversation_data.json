    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the given spectroscopic data to identify molecular fragments:**\n    *   **FTIR Spectrum:** The spectrum shows an absorption peak for an ester group. An ester group has the structure -COO-, which contributes C=O and C-O bonds. This adds one carbon and two oxygen atoms to the molecule.\n    *   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n        *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring & two aromatic-H signals:** A di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4) with two signals in the aromatic region strongly suggests a *para* (1,4) substitution pattern. This arrangement has a plane of symmetry, making the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to the two on the other side, resulting in two distinct signals (often two doublets). This fragment accounts for `C6H4`.\n        *   **Two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This pattern is characteristic of a `CH3-CH=CH-` group attached to a group with no adjacent protons (like our aromatic ring).\n            *   The proton adjacent to the CH3 group is split by the other vinyl proton (into a doublet) and by the three protons of the CH3 group (into a quartet). This results in a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n            *   The other vinyl proton is only split by the first vinyl proton, resulting in a **doublet (d)**.\n            *   This confirms the presence of a propenyl group, `-CH=CH-CH3`, attached to the aromatic ring. This fragment accounts for `C3H5`.\n        *   **Two -CH3 signals:** One methyl signal comes from the propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`). The second methyl signal must belong to the other substituent.\n        *   **No -CH2 signals:** The absence of methylene (-CH2-) signals is a crucial constraint that helps eliminate possibilities.\n\n2.  **Assemble the fragments to propose a structure:**\n    *   We have a *para*-substituted benzene ring (`C6H4`).\n    *   One substituent is the propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`).\n    *   The other substituent must contain the ester group (-COO-) and the second methyl group (-CH3). To satisfy the \"no -CH2- groups\" condition, this substituent can be a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate group attached via oxygen (`-O-CO-CH3`).\n    *   Two possible structures fit all the data:\n        *   **Isomer 1:** Methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate\n        *   **Isomer 2:** 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)phenyl acetate\n\n3.  **Determine the chemical formula from the assembled fragments:**\n    *   Let's calculate the formula by summing the atoms from the identified fragments:\n        *   Aromatic ring: `C6H4`\n        *   Propenyl group: `C3H5`\n        *   Ester and second methyl group (e.g., `-COOCH3`): `C2H3O2`\n    *   **Total atoms:**\n        *   Carbon (C): 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n        *   Hydrogen (H): 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n        *   Oxygen (O): 2\n    *   The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**. Both possible isomers have this same formula.\n\n4.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   The DoU indicates the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n    *   DoU calculated from the proposed structure: 4 (for the benzene ring) + 1 (for the vinyl C=C bond) + 1 (for the ester C=O bond) = **6**.\n    *   Now, let's calculate the DoU for the given options using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`\n        *   A) C11H12O2: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**\n        *   B) C12H12O2: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 13 - 6 = 7\n        *   C) C12H14O2: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 13 - 7 = 6\n        *   D) C11H14O2: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 12 - 7 = 5\n    *   The DoU must be 6, which eliminates options B and D. We are left with A (C11H12O2) and C (C12H14O2).\n\n5.  **Final choice between A and C:**\n    *   As determined in step 3, the fragments that perfectly match the spectroscopic data sum up to C11H12O2 (Option A).\n    *   Option C (C12H14O2) differs from our derived formula by one C and two H atoms, which is equivalent to a -CH2- group.\n    *   However, the problem explicitly states that there are **no signals for -CH2- groups**. This directly contradicts the formula C12H14O2.\n    *   Therefore, the only formula that is consistent with all the evidence is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
