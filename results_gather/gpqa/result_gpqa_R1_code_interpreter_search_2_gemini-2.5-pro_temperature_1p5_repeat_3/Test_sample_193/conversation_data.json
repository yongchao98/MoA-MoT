    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the partition function Z.\n\n### 1. Understanding the System and Microstates\nThe system consists of three spins: S1, S2, and S3. Each spin can take a value of +1 (spin up) or -1 (spin down).\nThe total number of possible configurations (microstates) of the system is 2 * 2 * 2 = 8.\nLet's list all 8 possible microstates as (S1, S2, S3):\n1.  (+1, +1, +1)\n2.  (+1, +1, -1)\n3.  (+1, -1, +1)\n4.  (-1, +1, +1)\n5.  (+1, -1, -1)\n6.  (-1, +1, -1)\n7.  (-1, -1, +1)\n8.  (-1, -1, -1)\n\n### 2. The Energy Equation\nThe energy of the system for a given state is given by the formula:\nE = -J[ S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ]\nwhere J is a constant.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Energy for Each Microstate\nWe will now calculate the energy for each of the 8 microstates. To do this, we first evaluate the term `S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3` for each state.\n\n*   **State 1: (+1, +1, +1)**\n    `S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3` = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n    E = -J * (3) = -3J\n\n*   **State 2: (+1, +1, -1)**\n    `S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3` = (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1\n    E = -J * (-1) = J\n\n*   **State 3: (+1, -1, +1)**\n    `S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3` = (1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (-1)(1) = -1 + 1 - 1 = -1\n    E = -J * (-1) = J\n\n*   **State 4: (-1, +1, +1)**\n    `S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3` = (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) + (1)(1) = -1 - 1 + 1 = -1\n    E = -J * (-1) = J\n\n*   **State 5: (+1, -1, -1)**\n    `S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3` = (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = -1 - 1 + 1 = -1\n    E = -J * (-1) = J\n\n*   **State 6: (-1, +1, -1)**\n    `S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3` = (-1)(1) + (-1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = -1 + 1 - 1 = -1\n    E = -J * (-1) = J\n\n*   **State 7: (-1, -1, +1)**\n    `S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3` = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1\n    E = -J * (-1) = J\n\n*   **State 8: (-1, -1, -1)**\n    `S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3` = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n    E = -J * (3) = -3J\n\n### 4. Grouping by Energy Levels (Degeneracy)\nNow we group the states that have the same energy level. The number of states at a given energy level is called the degeneracy (g).\n\n*   **Energy Level E1 = -3J:**\n    This energy level corresponds to the states (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1).\n    There are 2 states with this energy. So, the degeneracy is g1 = 2.\n\n*   **Energy Level E2 = J:**\n    This energy level corresponds to the other 6 states: (+1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, +1), (-1, +1, +1), (+1, -1, -1), (-1, +1, -1), and (-1, -1, +1).\n    There are 6 states with this energy. So, the degeneracy is g2 = 6.\n\n### 5. Calculating the Partition Function Z\nThe partition function Z is defined as the sum over all possible states of the Boltzmann factor, e^(-Eβ), where β = 1/(kT).\nZ = Σ_states e^(-Eβ)\n\nWe can simplify this sum by using the energy levels and their degeneracies:\nZ = g1 * e^(-E1β) + g2 * e^(-E2β)\n\nSubstituting the values we found:\nZ = 2 * e^(-(-3J)β) + 6 * e^(-(J)β)\nZ = 2 * e^(3Jβ) + 6 * e^(-Jβ)\n\n### 6. Conclusion\nThe calculated partition function is Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ). Comparing this with the given options:\nA) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\nB) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\nC) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\nD) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\n\nOur result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
