    "Here is the reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Fundamental Assumption:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ` (rho), is constant everywhere.\n\n2.  **Relate Distance and Parallax:** Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) to a star. The relationship is `plx = k/d`, where `k` is a constant. For simplicity in finding the proportionality, we can write `d ∝ 1/plx`. This also means `plx ∝ 1/d`.\n\n3.  **Consider a Volume of Space:** Let's find the number of stars (`dN`) in a thin spherical shell of space around the observer. This shell has an inner radius `d` and an outer radius `d + dd`.\n    *   The volume of this thin shell (`dV`) is approximately its surface area `(4πd^2)` multiplied by its thickness `(dd)`.\n    *   `dV = 4πd² * dd`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Number of Stars in the Shell:** Since the star density `ρ` is constant, the number of stars `dN` in this shell is the density multiplied by the volume of the shell.\n    *   `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n\n5.  **Express the Number of Stars in terms of Parallax:** Our goal is to find how `dN/d(plx)` depends on `plx`. To do this, we need to substitute `d` and `dd` with expressions involving `plx` and `d(plx)`.\n    *   From `d = k/plx`, we can substitute for `d`.\n    *   We also need to find the relationship between the thickness of the shell in distance (`dd`) and the corresponding interval in parallax (`d(plx)`). We can find this by differentiating `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d/d(plx) [k/plx] = -k/plx²`\n        Therefore, `dd = (-k/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n    *   The negative sign simply indicates that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. Since we are interested in the *number* of stars in a range (which must be a positive quantity), we can consider the magnitude of the relationship: `|dd| = (k/plx²) * |d(plx)|`.\n\n6.  **Substitute and Simplify:** Now, we substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` into our equation for `dN`:\n    *   `dN = ρ * 4π * d² * |dd|`\n    *   `dN = ρ * 4π * (k/plx)² * (k/plx²) * |d(plx)|`\n    *   `dN = ρ * 4π * (k²/plx²) * (k/plx²) * |d(plx)|`\n    *   `dN = (ρ * 4π * k³) * (1/plx⁴) * |d(plx)|`\n\n7.  **Find the Number of Stars per Unit Parallax:** The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is the expression `dN/d(plx)`.\n    *   From the equation above, we can divide by `|d(plx)|`:\n        `dN/|d(plx)| = (ρ * 4π * k³) * (1/plx⁴)`\n\n8.  **Determine the Proportionality:** The term `(ρ * 4π * k³)` is a constant. Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n    *   `dN/d(plx) ~ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
