    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula**\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula for DBE is C - H/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    *   DBE = 9 - (11/2) + (1/2) + 1\n    *   DBE = 9 - 5.5 + 0.5 + 1\n    *   DBE = 5\n*   **Interpretation:** A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional double bond (like C=O or C=C) or another ring.\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** These two distinct, medium-to-strong bands are a classic signature for the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH2)**. A secondary amine (-NHR) would typically show only one band in this region.\n*   **1720 cm-1:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl region. The frequency is characteristic of an **ester C=O group**. While aldehydes and ketones also absorb in this region, 1720 cm-1 is a very typical value for an ester, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring. It's generally too high for an amide C=O (usually < 1700 cm-1).\n\n*   **IR Summary:** The molecule contains a primary amine (-NH2) and a carbonyl group, most likely from an ester.\n\n**3. Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** A methyl (-CH3) group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (triplet, t):** The signal is split by two adjacent protons (n+1=3, so n=2). This indicates a -CH2- group is next to the -CH3.\n    *   **Fragment:** This signal, combined with the quartet below, points to an **ethyl group (-CH2CH3)**.\n\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** A methylene (-CH2-) group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (quartet, q):** The signal is split by three adjacent protons (n+1=4, so n=3). This confirms it is next to the -CH3 group.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a very downfield chemical shift for a CH2 group. It indicates that the CH2 is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom, and is likely part of an ester (-COO-**CH2**-CH3) or an ether (-O-**CH2**-CH3). Given the C=O from the IR, an ethyl ester is the most plausible structure.\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Two protons.\n    *   **Multiplicity (broad singlet, bs):** This is characteristic of protons that undergo chemical exchange, such as -OH or -NH protons. Combined with the IR data, this signal is definitively from the **-NH2 group**.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H + 2H = 4H):** Four protons on an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Splitting Pattern:** Two doublets of equal integration indicate a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Chemical Shifts:** The protons are split into two groups. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (EWG), like the ester (-COOR). The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is adjacent to an electron-donating group (EDG), like the amine (-NH2). This confirms the para substitution pattern with the -NH2 and the ester group on opposite sides of the ring.\n\n**4. Synthesize the Information and Evaluate Options**\n\nBased on the analysis, the compound is a **para-substituted benzene ring** with a **primary amine (-NH2)** group and an **ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3)** group. This structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this structure against the given options:\n\n*   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This has a secondary amine (amide) and an ether, which contradicts the IR (primary amine) and the NMR quartet position.\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This has meta substitution, which contradicts the NMR aromatic pattern (two doublets). It is also an amide, which is less likely given the IR C=O frequency.\n*   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** The structure is C6H4(NH2)(OOCCH2CH3). The ethyl group is part of a propionate group. The NMR signal for the CH2 group would be a quartet around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** The structure is C6H4(NH2)(COOCH2CH3). This structure is perfectly consistent with all the data:\n    *   Formula: C9H11NO2.\n    *   IR: Primary amine and ester C=O.\n    *   NMR: An ethyl group attached to the ester oxygen (-O-CH2CH3), a primary amine, and a para-disubstituted ring with an EDG and EWG.\n\nAll evidence points to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<D>>>"
