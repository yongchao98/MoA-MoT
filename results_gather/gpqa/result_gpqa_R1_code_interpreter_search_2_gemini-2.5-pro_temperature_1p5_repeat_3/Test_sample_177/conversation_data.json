    "This problem requires us to determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\\kappa$ and then to assess the renormalizability of the theory based on this dimension. The analysis is done using dimensional analysis in a system of natural units where $\\hbar = c = 1$.\n\n**1. Mass Dimension of the Lagrangian Density**\n\nThe action, $S$, is a dimensionless quantity in natural units. The action is defined as the integral of the Lagrangian density, $\\mathcal{L}$, over spacetime:\n$S = \\int d^4x \\, \\mathcal{L}$\nIn natural units, mass has dimension 1, denoted as $[M]^1$, and length has dimension of inverse mass, $[L] = [M]^{-1}$. Therefore, the four-dimensional spacetime volume element $d^4x$ has a mass dimension of:\n$[d^4x] = [L]^4 = ([M]^{-1})^4 = [M]^{-4}$\n\nFor the action $S$ to be dimensionless, the Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}$ must have a mass dimension that cancels out the dimension of $d^4x$:\n$[S] = [\\mathcal{L}] [d^4x] = [M]^0$\n$[\\mathcal{L}] \\cdot [M]^{-4} = [M]^0$\n$[\\mathcal{L}] = [M]^4$\nSo, any term in the Lagrangian density must have a mass dimension of 4.\n\n**2. Mass Dimensions of the Fields**\n\nWe need to find the mass dimensions of the fields present in the interaction term $\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}$. These are the fermion field $\\psi$ and the electromagnetic field strength tensor $F^{\\mu\\nu}$.\n\n*   **Fermion Field ($\\psi$)**: The kinetic term for a fermion in the Dirac Lagrangian is $\\mathcal{L}_{kin} = \\bar{\\psi}(i\\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu)\\psi$. This term must have a mass dimension of 4. The gamma matrices $\\gamma^\\mu$ are dimensionless. The derivative operator $\\partial_\\mu = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^\\mu}$ has the dimension of inverse length, so $[\\partial_\\mu] = [M]^1$.\n    $[\\mathcal{L}_{kin}] = [\\bar{\\psi}] [\\gamma^\\mu] [\\partial_\\mu] [\\psi] = [M]^4$\n    Assuming the spinor and its conjugate have the same dimension, $[\\bar{\\psi}] = [\\psi]$, we get:\n    $[\\psi]^2 \\cdot [M]^0 \\cdot [M]^1 = [M]^4$\n    $[\\psi]^2 = [M]^3$\n    $[\\psi] = [\\bar{\\psi}] = [M]^{3/2}$\n\n*   **Electromagnetic Field Strength Tensor ($F^{\\mu\\nu}$)**: The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is $\\mathcal{L}_{EM} = -\\frac{1}{4}F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$. This term must also have a mass dimension of 4.\n    $[\\mathcal{L}_{EM}] = [F^{\\mu\\nu}]^2 = [M]^4$\n    $[F^{\\mu\\nu}] = [M]^2$\n\n*   **Tensor $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$**: This is defined as $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}=\\frac{i}{2}[\\gamma_{\\mu},\\gamma_{\\nu}]$. Since the gamma matrices $\\gamma_\\mu$ are dimensionless, their commutator is also a dimensionless matrix.\n    $[\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}] = [M]^0$\n\n**3. Mass Dimension of the Coupling Constant ($\\kappa$)**\n\nNow we can determine the mass dimension of $\\kappa$ from the interaction Lagrangian term $\\mathcal{L}_{int}$. This term must also have a mass dimension of 4.\n$[\\mathcal{L}_{int}] = [\\kappa] [\\bar{\\psi}] [\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}] [\\psi] [F^{\\mu\\nu}] = [M]^4$\n\nSubstituting the mass dimensions we found for each component:\n$[\\kappa] \\cdot [M]^{3/2} \\cdot [M]^0 \\cdot [M]^{3/2} \\cdot [M]^2 = [M]^4$\n$[\\kappa] \\cdot [M]^{3/2 + 3/2 + 2} = [M]^4$\n$[\\kappa] \\cdot [M]^{3+2} = [M]^4$\n$[\\kappa] \\cdot [M]^5 = [M]^4$\n$[\\kappa] = \\frac{[M]^4}{[M]^5} = [M]^{-1}$\n\nThe mass dimension of $\\kappa$ is -1.\n\n**4. Renormalizability of the Theory**\n\nThe renormalizability of a theory can be determined by the mass dimension of its coupling constants. Let the mass dimension of a coupling constant be $d$.\n*   If $d > 0$, the theory is **super-renormalizable**.\n*   If $d = 0$, the theory is **renormalizable**.\n*   If $d < 0$, the theory is **non-renormalizable**.\n\nIn this case, the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\\kappa$ is $d = -1$. Since the mass dimension is negative, the theory is **non-renormalizable** by power counting. A negative mass dimension coupling becomes stronger at higher energies, leading to new types of infinities at each order of perturbation theory, which cannot be absorbed by a finite number of counter-terms.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe mass dimension of $\\kappa$ is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
