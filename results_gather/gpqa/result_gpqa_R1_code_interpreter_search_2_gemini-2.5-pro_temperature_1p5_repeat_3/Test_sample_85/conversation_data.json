    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**1. Analyze the Products and Starting Materials**\n\n*   **Products:** Both reactions produce a lactone (a cyclic ester) called 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Reaction A yields the (R)-enantiomer, and Reaction B yields the (S)-enantiomer. The chiral center is the carbon at position 4, which bears the ethyl group.\n*   **Lactone Formation:** This six-membered lactone is formed by the intramolecular cyclization of a 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n*   **Starting Materials:** The options suggest the starting materials A and B are stereoisomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". This is a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid) where one carboxylic acid group is free (-COOH) and the other is esterified with isobutanol (-COOiBu). Let's call this molecule the \"half-ester\". The chiral center is at carbon 3.\n\n**Structure of the Half-Ester:**\nHOOC-CH₂(b)-CH(Et)(c)-CH₂(d)-COO-isobutyl(e)\nThe chiral center is the carbon labeled (c).\n\n**2. Analyze Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reagents:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺\n*   **Reactivity of LiBH₄:** Lithium borohydride is a mild reducing agent. It selectively reduces esters and aldehydes/ketones, but it does not reduce carboxylic acids under these conditions.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH₄ reduces the isobutyl ester group (-COOiBu) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is untouched.\n    2.  The intermediate formed is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid: HOOC-CH₂(b)-CH(Et)(c)-CH₂(d)-CH₂OH(e')\n    3.  The H⁺ workup catalyzes the lactonization (intramolecular esterification), where the -OH group attacks the -COOH group to form the six-membered lactone ring.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Throughout this process, none of the reactions involve breaking or forming bonds at the chiral center (c). Therefore, the 3D arrangement of the groups around the chiral center is preserved.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reagents:** B + BH₃ + H⁺\n*   **Reactivity of BH₃:** Borane is a strong reducing agent that is particularly effective at reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols. It reduces carboxylic acids much faster than it reduces esters.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The isobutyl ester group (-COOiBu) is left largely intact.\n    2.  The intermediate formed after reduction is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate: HOCH₂(a')-CH₂(b)-CH(Et)(c)-CH₂(d)-COO-isobutyl(e)\n    3.  The H⁺ workup first catalyzes the hydrolysis of the remaining isobutyl ester to a carboxylic acid.\n    4.  This yields the same 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid intermediate as in Reaction A: HOCH₂(a')-CH₂(b)-CH(Et)(c)-CH₂(d)-COOH(e')\n    5.  Finally, lactonization occurs to form the product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in Reaction A, none of the bonds to the chiral center (c) are altered, so the 3D arrangement is preserved.\n\n**4. The Crucial Step: Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Priority Rules**\n\nAlthough the 3D structure at the chiral center is preserved in both reactions, the final R/S designation depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the substituents. We need to check if the relative priorities change.\n\n*   **Priorities in the Starting Half-Ester:**\n    The four groups attached to the chiral carbon are:\n    1.  -H\n    2.  -CH₂CH₃ (ethyl)\n    3.  -CH₂COOH (carboxy-methyl)\n    4.  -CH₂COOiBu (isobutoxycarbonyl-methyl)\n\n    Comparing priorities:\n    *   The carbon in -CH₂**C**OOH or -CH₂**C**OOiBu is attached to three oxygens (counting the double bond twice), while the carbon in -CH₂**C**H₃ is attached to three hydrogens. So both oxygen-containing groups outrank the ethyl group.\n    *   Comparing -CH₂COOiBu and -CH₂COOH: They are identical until the oxygen of the -OH vs -O-iBu. The carbon of the isobutyl group has a higher atomic number than the hydrogen of the hydroxyl group.\n    *   Therefore, the priority order is: **-CH₂COOiBu > -CH₂COOH > -CH₂CH₃ > -H**\n\n*   **Priorities in the Product Lactone:**\n    The four groups attached to the chiral carbon are:\n    1.  -H\n    2.  -CH₂CH₃ (ethyl)\n    3.  -CH₂-C(=O)-O- (part of the lactone ring)\n    4.  -CH₂-CH₂-O- (the other part of the lactone ring)\n\n    Comparing priorities:\n    *   Comparing the two ring fragments: -CH₂-**C**(=O)-O- vs -CH₂-**C**H₂-O-. The second carbon in the second fragment is bonded to an Oxygen, which outranks the second carbon in the first fragment (which is bonded to other oxygens but is still a carbon).\n    *   Therefore, the priority order is: **-CH₂-CH₂-O- > -CH₂-C(=O)-O- > -CH₂CH₃ > -H**\n\n**5. Putting it all together:**\n\n*   **For Reaction A (A → (R)-lactone):**\n    *   The highest priority group in starting material A (-CH₂COOiBu) is reduced and becomes the highest priority group in the product (-CH₂-CH₂-O-).\n    *   The second priority group in A (-CH₂COOH) becomes the second priority group in the product (-CH₂-C(=O)-O-).\n    *   Since the relative priority ordering of the groups does not change, the stereochemical descriptor (R/S) does not change.\n    *   Therefore, to obtain the **(R)**-lactone, starting material **A** must be **(R)**.\n\n*   **For Reaction B (B → (S)-lactone):**\n    *   The second priority group in starting material B (-CH₂COOH) is reduced and becomes the highest priority group in the product (-CH₂-CH₂-O-).\n    *   The highest priority group in B (-CH₂COOiBu) becomes the second priority group in the product (-CH₂-C(=O)-O-).\n    *   The priorities of the top two groups have been **swapped**. Swapping two groups at a chiral center inverts the R/S designation.\n    *   Therefore, an (R) starting material will yield a product that is named (S). To obtain the **(S)**-lactone, starting material **B** must be **(R)**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth reactions require the same starting material.\n*   A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   B = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
