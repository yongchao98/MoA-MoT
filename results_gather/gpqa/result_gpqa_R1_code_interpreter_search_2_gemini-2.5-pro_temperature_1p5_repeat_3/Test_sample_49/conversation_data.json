    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning to determine the number of loops in the Feynman diagram:\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Factor:** In Quantum Field Theory (QFT), calculations for Feynman diagrams involve integrating over all possible values of momenta that are not fixed by conservation laws. Each closed loop in a diagram corresponds to one such unconstrained momentum, requiring an integral.\n\n2.  **The Loop Integral Factor:** When performing these calculations in `d`-dimensional spacetime, each loop integral over a momentum `k` (written as `∫ d^d k / (2pi)^d`) contributes a characteristic geometrical factor to the final result. After carrying out the angular part of the integration (using hyperspherical coordinates), a standard factor emerges.\n\n3.  **Spacetime Dimension:** The problem specifies that the theory is on **four-dimensional spacetime**, so we set `d=4`.\n\n4.  **Deriving the Factor per Loop:** For a single loop in `d=4` spacetime, the integration measure `∫ d^4 k` combined with the standard `1/(2pi)^4` from the Fourier transform yields a factor of `1/(4pi)^2` after the angular integration is performed.\n    *   The general formula for an `L`-loop diagram will therefore contain `L` of these factors multiplied together.\n    *   Factor for an `L`-loop diagram = `(1/(4pi)^2)^L = 1/(4pi)^(2L)`.\n\n5.  **Analyzing the Given Expression:** The expression provided is:\n    `alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`\n\n    The other terms relate to different aspects of the diagram:\n    *   `alpha^3 * g^2`: These are coupling constants, related to the number and type of vertices (interaction points) in the diagram.\n    *   `sqrt(2) * 8`: These are numerical factors that arise from the specific symmetries and combinatorics of the diagram.\n    *   `(Q/M)^2`: This is a ratio of energy scales or masses, which appears after the full momentum integral is evaluated.\n\n    The crucial term for determining the number of loops is `1/(4pi)^6`.\n\n6.  **Solving for the Number of Loops (L):** We equate the general formula for the loop factor with the one from the colleague's note:\n\n    `1/(4pi)^(2L) = 1/(4pi)^6`\n\n    By comparing the exponents in the denominator, we get:\n\n    `2L = 6`\n\n    Solving for `L`, we find:\n\n    `L = 3`\n\nTherefore, the Feynman diagram must have contained three loops.\n\n<<<C>>>"
