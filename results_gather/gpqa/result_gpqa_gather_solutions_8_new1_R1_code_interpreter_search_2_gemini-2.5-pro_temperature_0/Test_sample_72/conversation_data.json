The relative speed ($v_{rel}$) is the magnitude of this velocity.\n        $v_{rel} = |v_{21}| \\approx 0.1428c$\n    5.  Rounding to two decimal places, we get $v_{rel} = 0.14c$.\n\n**Part B: Calculating the Total Energy of the System ($E_{total}$)**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The total energy of a relativistic particle is not just its kinetic energy or its rest energy ($mc^2$), but the sum of both.

Sum the individual energies:\n        $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n    2.  $E_{total} = (2.5 + 2\\sqrt{3}) mc^2 \\approx (2.5 + 3.464) mc^2 = 5.964 mc^2$\n    3.
