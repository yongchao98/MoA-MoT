    "Here are the tests for the solution:\n1.  **Test 1 (Typical Case):** Given a yeast cell arrested in the G1 phase to form a shmoo, the function should identify the pre-replication complex as the least likely to be found in active chromatin, as the cell is not proceeding to DNA synthesis. Expected output: 'D'.\n2.  **Test 2 (Control Case 1):** Given a yeast cell actively undergoing DNA synthesis in S phase, the pre-replication complex would be active (or have just been active). It should not be the least likely complex. Expected output: Not 'D'.\n3.  **Test 3 (Control Case 2):** Given a yeast cell in the G2 or M phase, the pre-replication complex has been disassembled after S phase and would be absent from chromatin. The function should identify it as unlikely. Expected output: 'D'.\n4.  **Test 4 (Control Case 3):** In a G1-arrested shmoo, transcription-related complexes like the pre-initiation complex are essential for the mating response. The function should correctly identify that this complex is *not* the least likely. Expected output: Not 'C'.\n\n```python\ndef solve_proteome_question(cell_state):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the state of a yeast cell to determine which protein complex\n    is least likely to be associated with active chromatin.\n\n    The key biological principle is that yeast cells forming a shmoo are\n    arrested in the G1 phase of the cell cycle.
