The name specifies a single enantiomer (`R`).\n    *   Expected: Optically active.\n\n6.  **Test Case 6: Symmetric Cyclic Polyol**\n    *   Compound: `(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol`\n    *   Reasoning: This is a highly symmetric molecule (all-cis isomer), possessing multiple planes of symmetry. It is achiral.\n    *   Expected: Not optically active.\n\n7.  **Test Case 7: Acyclic Ketone with no Stereocenter**\n    *   Compound: `1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one`\n    *   Reasoning: The molecule lacks any chiral centers and has a plane of symmetry.

    "A compound is optically active if it is chiral and not present as a racemic mixture. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image, which typically means it lacks an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule has a plane of symmetry containing the C=C double bond. Therefore, it is achiral and not optically active.\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name explicitly defines a single enantiomer with specific stereocenters (`3aR`, `7aS`). A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is always optically active.\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This compound has two chiral centers. However, the `(R,S)` configuration, along with the symmetrical structure of the molecule, creates an internal plane of symmetry. This is a meso compound, which is achiral and thus not optically active.\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a specific enantiomer of a chiral compound (its mirror image is `2S,3S`). It lacks an internal plane of symmetry and is therefore chiral and optically active.\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom bonded to the -OH group (C1) is a stereocenter. The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer, which is optically active.\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This molecule has all three hydroxyl groups on the same side of the ring (all-cis). This high degree of symmetry results in multiple planes of symmetry, making the molecule achiral and not optically active.\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: This molecule has no chiral centers and possesses a plane of symmetry. It is achiral and not optically active.\n\nThe optically active compounds are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<C>>>"
