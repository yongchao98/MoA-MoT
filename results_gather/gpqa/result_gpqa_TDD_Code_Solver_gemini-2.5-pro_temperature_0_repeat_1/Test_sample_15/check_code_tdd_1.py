    This function checks the correctness of the LLM's answer regarding the optical activity of a list of chemical compounds.

    The core principle is: A compound is optically active if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image, which typically means it lacks an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.
