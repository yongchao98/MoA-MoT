    # --- Chemical Logic Verification ---

    # 1. Determine the correct starting material 'A'
    # The product is 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one, a 6-membered ring.
    # This product is formed via a ring-expansion rearrangement.
    # A favorable 5-membered to 6-membered ring expansion occurs from the cyclopentanol derivative.
    # The cyclohexanol derivative would favor a p-tolyl shift over a 6->7 ring expansion.
    correct_A = "1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclopentan-1-ol"

    # 2. Determine the correct product 'B'
    # Starting material: methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate
    # The most stable carbocation forms at the tertiary, benzylic position (C2).
    # The adjacent carbon (C3) has a hydrogen and a methyl group.
    # Migratory aptitude is H > methyl, so a 1,2-hydride shift occurs.
    # This leads to a ketone at C3.
