    # Define symbolic variables for the physical quantities.

    # --- Step 1: Analyze Charge Induction ---
    # The charge +q inside the cavity induces a charge -q on the inner surface.
    charge_on_inner_surface = -q
    # Since the conductor was initially uncharged, a charge +q is induced on the
    # outer surface to maintain overall charge neutrality.
    charge_on_outer_surface = q

    # --- Step 2: Apply the Principle of Electrostatic Shielding ---
    # The conductor material shields the outer surface from the electric field
    # generated by the charge inside the cavity (+q) and the induced charge on the
    # inner surface (-q).
    # Therefore, the charge on the outer surface (+q) distributes itself uniformly,
    # as if it were the only charge on an isolated spherical conductor.
    # The specific location of the cavity (s) and the charge within it are irrelevant
    # for the external field.

    # --- Step 3: Apply Gauss's Law (or Shell Theorem) ---
    # For a point outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution, the electric
    # field is the same as that of a point charge with the same total charge
    # located at the center of the sphere.
    #
    # - The relevant charge is the total charge on the outer surface.
    # - The center of the distribution is the center of the conductor.
    # - The distance to the external point P is L.

    # Calculate the derived electric field magnitude based on these principles.
    derived_E = k * charge_on_outer_surface / L**2

    # The answer provided corresponds to option A.

        # The logic is consistent. Now, let's check the constraints.
        # The question provides extra variables: l, s, theta.
        # Our derived formula E = k*q/L^2 does NOT depend on l, s, or theta.
        # This is a key feature of electrostatic shielding and confirms the reasoning.
        # Options B, C, and D incorrectly depend on these irrelevant parameters.
        # Option B: E = k*q/l^2 (Incorrectly assumes the charge is at the cavity's center and there's no shielding)
        # Options C and D: Use complex distances involving l, s, and theta, which is incorrect.
