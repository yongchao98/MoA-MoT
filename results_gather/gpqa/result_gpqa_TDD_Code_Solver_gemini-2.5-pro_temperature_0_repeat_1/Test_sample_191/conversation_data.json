    "Here are the steps following the Test-Driven Development methodology to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Tests\nBased on the principles of electrostatic induction and shielding (Gauss's Law), the electric field outside the conductor should only depend on the total charge induced on the outer surface and the distance from the center of the conductor. The charge `+q` in the cavity induces a charge `+q` on the outer surface of the conductor, which distributes uniformly. Therefore, the field at an external point `P` at a distance `L` from the conductor's center is equivalent to that of a point charge `+q` located at the center. The other parameters (`r`, `s`, `l`, `theta`) are irrelevant.\n\nLet's define `k = 1 / (4 * pi * epsilon_o)`. For simplicity in our tests, we will set `k=1`. The formula should be `E = k * q / L^2`.\n\nHere are a few tests to verify this:\n*   **Test 1 (Typical case):** `q=10`, `L=5`. The expected electric field is `E = 1 * 10 / 5^2 = 0.4`.\n*   **Test 2 (Different distance):** `q=10`, `L=10`. The expected electric field is `E = 1 * 10 / 10^2 = 0.1`.\n*   **Test 3 (Different charge):** `q=20`, `L=5`. The expected electric field is `E = 1 * 20 / 5^2 = 0.8`.\n*   **Test 4 (Unit values):** `q=1`, `L=1`. The expected electric field is `E = 1 * 1 / 1^2 = 1.0`.\n\n### 2. Python Implementation\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_electric_field(q, L, R=None, r=None, s=None, l=None, theta=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the magnitude of the electric field at a point P outside a spherical conductor.\n\n    The charge +q inside the cavity induces a charge -q on the inner surface of the cavity\n    and a charge +q on the outer surface of the spherical conductor. Due to the spherical\n    symmetry of the outer conductor, this induced charge +q distributes itself uniformly\n    on the outer surface.\n\n    By Gauss's Law (or the Shell Theorem), the electric field at any point outside this\n    spherically symmetric charge distribution is the same as if all the charge (+q) were\n    concentrated at the center of the sphere.\n\n    Therefore, the electric field at a distance L from the center of the conductor is\n    given by Coulomb's Law for a point charge.

    "The charge `+q` placed inside the cavity induces a charge `-q` on the inner surface of the cavity.
