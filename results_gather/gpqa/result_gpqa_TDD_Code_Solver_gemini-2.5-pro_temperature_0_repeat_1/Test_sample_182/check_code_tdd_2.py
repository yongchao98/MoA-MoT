    This function verifies the answer to a chemistry problem by programmatically
    determining the product's structure and calculating its Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD).

    Question: What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when
    2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?
    Options: A) 3, B) 0, C) 5, D) 1

    # Step 1: Determine the molecular formula of the starting material.
    # Name: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid
    # - cyclohex: 6-carbon ring skeleton.
    # - carboxylic acid (-COOH): 1 C, 2 O, 1 H.
    # - formyl (-CHO): 1 C, 1 O, 1 H.
    # - vinyl (-CH=CH2): 2 C, 3 H.
    # Total Carbons (C) = 6 (ring) + 1 (acid) + 1 (formyl) + 2 (vinyl) = 10
    # Total Oxygens (O) = 2 (acid) + 1 (formyl) = 3
    # To find Hydrogens (H), let's count them on the full structure:
    #   - C1 (with COOH): 1 H
    #   - C2 (with CHO): 1 H
    #   - C3 (in C=C): 1 H
    #   - C4 (in C=C): 1 H
    #   - C5 (with vinyl): 1 H
    #   - C6 (CH2): 2 H
    #   - H from COOH: 1 H
    #   - H from CHO: 1 H
    #   - H from vinyl: 3 H
    # Total Hydrogens (H) = (1+1+1+1+1+2) + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12
    # Reactant Formula: C10H12O3

    # Step 2: Understand the reaction and determine the product's formula.
    # Reagent: Red Phosphorus + excess HI.
    # This is a powerful reducing agent that performs complete reduction.
    # - All multiple bonds (C=C, C=O) are reduced to single bonds.
    # - All oxygen atoms are removed and replaced with hydrogens.
    # The result is a saturated hydrocarbon with the same carbon skeleton.
    # The starting material has a 6-membered ring and a total of 10 carbon atoms.
    # The product will be a saturated monocyclic alkane with 10 carbons.
    # The general formula for a saturated monocyclic alkane is C_n H_{2n}.
    # Product Formula: C10H20

    # Step 3: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) for the product.
    # IHD = C - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2) + 1
    # For the product C10H20:
    # C = 10, H = 20, X = 0, N = 0
    product_ihd = 10 - (20 / 2) + 1
    product_ihd = int(product_ihd) # Ensure it's an integer

    # Step 4: The provided answer claims the solution is correct. The correct solution
    # corresponds to one of the options. Our calculated IHD is 1, which is option D.
    # We will check if our calculated IHD matches the value from the correct option.
    expected_ihd = 1 # From option D

    # Step 5: Verify the result.
    if product_ihd == expected_ihd:
        return "Correct"
    else:
        return (f"Incorrect. The calculated IHD of the product is {product_ihd}, but the correct answer is {expected_ihd}. "
                f"The reaction of 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid (C10H12O3) with Red P/HI "
                f"yields a saturated monocyclic alkane (C10H20). The IHD for any saturated monocyclic compound is 1, "
                f"which represents the single ring.")
