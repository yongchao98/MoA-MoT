    2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?

    Provided Answer Option: D) 1

    # --- Step 1: Define problem parameters ---
    reactant_name = "2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid"
    reagents = "red phosphorus and excess of HI"
    # The provided answer is D, which corresponds to a value of 1.
    llm_answer_value = 1

    # --- Step 2: Analyze the reactant's core structure from its IUPAC name ---
    # The name "cyclohex" explicitly indicates that the molecule's core structure is a single ring.
    # A more complex molecule might have "bicyclo", "spiro", etc.
    # For this reactant, the number of rings is 1.
    num_rings_in_reactant = 1

    # --- Step 3: Analyze the effect of the chemical reaction ---
    # The reaction with red phosphorus and excess HI is a well-known complete reduction reaction in organic chemistry.
    # Its effect is to reduce all functional groups containing oxygen and all carbon-carbon pi bonds.
    # - Aldehyde (-CHO) -> Alkane (-CH3)
    # - Carboxylic acid (-COOH) -> Alkane (-CH3)
    # - Alkene (C=C) -> Alkane (C-C)
    # The fundamental carbon skeleton, including the number of rings, is preserved.

    # --- Step 4: Determine the structure and IHD of the final product ---
    # The reactant has one ring and several pi bonds (in the ring, vinyl, formyl, and carboxyl groups).
    # The reaction saturates all pi bonds but does not break the ring.
    # Therefore, the product is a saturated monocyclic alkane.
    # The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) is defined as: IHD = (number of rings) + (number of pi bonds).
    # Since the product is saturated, the number of pi bonds is 0.
    # The IHD of the product is solely determined by its number of rings.
    calculated_product_ihd = num_rings_in_reactant

    # --- Step 5: Compare the calculated result with the provided answer ---
