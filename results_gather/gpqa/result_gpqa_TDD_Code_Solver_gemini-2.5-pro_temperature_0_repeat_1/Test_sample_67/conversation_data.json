    "The problem describes the Larmor precession of a spin-1/2 particle. Initially, the spin is an eigenstate of the `Sz` operator, aligned with a magnetic field in the Z-direction. When the magnetic field is switched to the Y-direction, the spin starts to precess around the new field direction (the Y-axis).\n\nThe Hamiltonian for the interaction is `H = -μ · B`, where `μ = γS` is the magnetic moment operator and `S` is the spin operator. With the new field `B = B_0 * y_hat`, the Hamiltonian becomes `H = -γB_0 * Sy`.\n\nThe time evolution of the expectation value of any operator `A` is given by the Heisenberg equation of motion:\n`d<A>/dt = (i/ħ) * <[H, A]>`\n\nWe are interested in the oscillation of `<μ_z> = γ<Sz>`. Let's find the equation of motion for `<Sz>`:\n`d<Sz>/dt = (i/ħ) * <[H, Sz]> = (i/ħ) * <[-γB_0*Sy, Sz]>`\nUsing the commutation relation `[Sy, Sz] = iħSx`, we get:\n`d<Sz>/dt = (i/ħ) * (-γB_0) * (iħ<Sx>) = γB_0 * <Sx>`\n\nTo solve this, we also need the equation of motion for `<Sx>`:\n`d<Sx>/dt = (i/ħ) * <[H, Sx]> = (i/ħ) * <[-γB_0*Sy, Sx]>`\nUsing the commutation relation `[Sy, Sx] = -iħSz`, we get:\n`d<Sx>/dt = (i/ħ) * (-γB_0) * (-iħ<Sz>) = -γB_0 * <Sz>`\n\nNow we have a system of two coupled differential equations:\n1. `d<Sz>/dt = γB_0 * <Sx>`\n2. `d<Sx>/dt = -γB_0 * <Sz>`\n\nTo find the oscillation frequency of `<Sz>`, we can differentiate the first equation with respect to time and substitute the second equation into it:\n`d²<Sz>/dt² = γB_0 * d<Sx>/dt`\n`d²<Sz>/dt² = γB_0 * (-γB_0 * <Sz>)`\n`d²<Sz>/dt² = -(γB_0)² * <Sz>`\n\nThis is the standard equation for a simple harmonic oscillator, `d²x/dt² = -ω²x`, where `ω` is the angular frequency of oscillation. By comparing the two equations, we can see that the oscillation frequency `ω` is:\n`ω = γB_0`\n\nThis frequency is known as the Larmor frequency. The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z>`, will oscillate at this frequency.\n\nGiven the options:\nA) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nB) gamma*B\nC) gamma*B/2\nD) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n\nThe correct answer is `gamma*B`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
