    Checks the correctness of the provided answer for the spin precession problem.

    The problem asks for the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the magnetic moment.
    As derived from first principles (both Heisenberg and Schr√∂dinger pictures), the
    time evolution of the expectation value of the z-component of spin is:
    <Sz>(t) = (<Sz>(0)) * cos(gamma * B * t)
    This shows that the quantity oscillates with an angular frequency of omega = gamma * B.

    This code checks if the LLM's selected option corresponds to this correct frequency.
