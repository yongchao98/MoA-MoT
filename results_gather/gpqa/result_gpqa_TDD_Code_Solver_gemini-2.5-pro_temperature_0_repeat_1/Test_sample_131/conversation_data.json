    "Here are the steps following the Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Tests\nHere is a list of small, explicit tests the solution should satisfy, based on the analysis of the 1H NMR spectra for each potential compound and the mixture.\n\n*   **Test 1: Exclude 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.** Its spectrum should contain aromatic doublets, not singlets, due to adjacent aromatic protons.\n*   **Test 2: Exclude 1,4-diethylbenzene.** Its spectrum should contain aliphatic signals that are not singlets (a quartet and a triplet).\n*   **Test 3: Analyze 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene).** Due to its high symmetry, it should show one aromatic singlet (2H) and one aliphatic singlet (12H).\n*   **Test 4: Analyze 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene).** Due to its plane of symmetry, it should show one aromatic singlet (2H) and three distinct aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H), giving a 2:1:1 ratio.\n*   **Test 5: Analyze the 1:1 Mixture.** A mixture of Durene and Isodurene should be consistent with the observed spectrum.\n    *   **Aromatic region:** Durene's 2H singlet and Isodurene's 2H singlet, if at different chemical shifts, would produce two singlets with a 2H:2H or 1:1 integration ratio. This matches the observation.\n    *   **Aliphatic region:** Durene's 12H singlet and Isodurene's three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H) can combine to match the observation. If the two 3H signals from Isodurene are accidentally degenerate (overlap), the mixture would show three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and (3H+3H)=6H. This corresponds to a 2:1:1 ratio.\n*   **Test 6: Final Answer.** The function should correctly identify the pair as 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, which corresponds to option D.\n\n### 2.

    "Excellent! The Test-Driven Development process successfully guided us to the correct solution, which has been confirmed.\n\nThe analysis correctly identified that:\n1.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,4-diethylbenzene** could be eliminated because their expected spectra do not consist solely of singlets.\n2.  A 1:1 mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** (Durene) and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene** (Isodurene) perfectly matches the described NMR data, accounting for the number, integration, and ratios of both the aromatic and aliphatic signals.\n\nI'm glad the checker confirmed the output. I am ready for your next question."
