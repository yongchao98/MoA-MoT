    "I need to find the distance from Earth to the Large Magellanic Cloud to solve this problem.\n<search>distance to Large Magellanic Cloud</search>\n>>>\n1.  **Test for Lorentz Factor Calculation:** Given a speed of 0.8c, the Lorentz factor (gamma) should be approximately 1.667. This tests the core relativistic formula.\n2.  **Test for Zero Speed:** If the spacecraft's speed is 0, the time taken should be effectively infinite, but for calculation purposes, the time experienced by the astronaut should be the same as the time measured from Earth (gamma = 1). A trip of 1 light-year at a very slow speed should take a very long time for both.\n3.  **Test for the Main Scenario:** Using a distance of approximately 158,000 light-years (a commonly cited value for the LMC that aligns with the provided options) and a speed of 0.99999987c, the calculated travel time for the astronaut should be approximately 80.56 years.\n4.  **Test for Lifespan:** The astronaut starts at age 22. The calculated travel time (~80.56 years) added to their initial age (22 + 80.56 = 102.56) must be less than their average lifespan of 150 years.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_relativity_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the travel time for an astronaut considering time dilation.\n    \n    The core physics involves:\n    1.
