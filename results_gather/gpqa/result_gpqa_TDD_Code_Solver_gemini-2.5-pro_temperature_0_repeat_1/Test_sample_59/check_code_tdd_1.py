    """
    This function checks the correctness of the given answer to the special relativity problem.

    The problem involves calculating the proper time (time experienced by the astronaut)
    for a journey from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) to Earth.

    The steps are:
    1.  Define all known constants from the problem and external sources (distance to LMC).
    2.  Calculate the time for the journey in Earth's reference frame (dilated time, Δt).
    3.  Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ) from the given speed.
    4.  Calculate the time experienced by the astronaut (proper time, Δt₀) using the formula Δt₀ = Δt / γ.
    5.  Check if the astronaut survives the journey by comparing their final age to the species' average lifespan.
    6.  Compare the calculated proper time with the given options to find the closest one.
    7.  Verify if the provided answer matches the most plausible option.
