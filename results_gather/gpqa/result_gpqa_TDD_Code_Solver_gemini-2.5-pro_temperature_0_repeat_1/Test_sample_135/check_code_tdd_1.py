    # Question: Evaluate ∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV for f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat in a sphere of radius R.
    # We use the Divergence Theorem: ∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS).
    
    # On the surface of the sphere, r = R.
    # f = (1/R^2) * r_hat
    # dS = R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ * r_hat
    # f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ = sin(θ) dθ dφ

    # We need to integrate sin(θ) over the surface of a sphere.

    # Let's check the options:
    # A) 4/3 π R

    # D) 0
    # Our result, 4π, matches option C.

1.  **Irrelevant Reasoning:** The entire solution, including the Python code and tests, is for a completely different problem (a particle in a 1D quantum box). It has no relevance to the given vector calculus question.
2.  **Correct Calculation:** The question asks for the volume integral of the divergence of the field f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat. Using the Divergence Theorem, this integral is equivalent to the flux of the field through the surface of the sphere.
3.  **Correct Result:** The flux calculation is ∮(f ⋅ dS) = ∫(from 0 to 2π)dφ ∫(from 0 to π)sin(θ)dθ = 4π.
4.  **Conclusion:** The correct answer is 4π, which is option C. The provided answer was B (value 1), which is incorrect."""
