The tests passed, and the calculated factor of approximately 0.432 confirms that option D is the correct answer.\n\nThe reasoning is based on the relationship for the total mass (M) of a double-lined spectroscopic binary system:\nM ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂)²\n\nWhere:\n*   P is the orbital period.\n*   K₁ and K₂ are the radial velocity amplitudes.\n\nFor the two systems:\n*   **System 1**: P₁ = 2 years, K₁_sum = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n*   **System 2**: P₂ = 1 year, K₂_sum = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nThe ratio of their masses (M₁ / M₂) is:\nM₁ / M₂ = (P₁ * (K₁_sum)³) / (P₂ * (K₂_sum)³)\nM₁ / M₂ = (2 * 15³) / (1 * 25³)\nM₁ / M₂ = (2 * 3375) / (1 * 15625)\nM₁ / M₂ = 6750 / 15625\nM₁ / M₂ = 0.432\n\nThis value is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
