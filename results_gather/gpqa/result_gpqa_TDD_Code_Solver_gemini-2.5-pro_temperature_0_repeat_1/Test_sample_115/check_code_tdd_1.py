    # Question: 1H NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (6H) and a quartet at 1.3 ppm (4H).
    # LLM Answer: n-butane (CH3-CH2-CH2-CH3)
    # Check: n-butane has two equivalent CH3 groups (6H) and two equivalent CH2 groups (4H).
    # The CH3 protons are split by the adjacent CH2 (2 protons), so n+1 = 3 (triplet).

    # This perfectly matches the data.

    # --- Step 2: Identify Compound B ---
    # Question: A undergoes monobromination to form B.
    # LLM Answer: 2-bromobutane
    # Check: Radical bromination of n-butane is selective for the more stable secondary radical
    # over the primary radical. Thus, the major product is 2-bromobutane.

    # --- Step 3: Identify Compound C ---
    # Question: B reacts with alcoholic KOH to form C. C has two geometrical isomers.
    # The cis-isomer of C is used.
    # LLM Answer: cis-but-2-ene
    # Check: E2 elimination of 2-bromobutane with a strong, small base like KOH favors the
    # more substituted alkene (Zaitsev's rule), which is but-2-ene. But-2-ene exists as
    # cis and trans isomers. The question specifies using the cis-isomer.

    # --- Step 4: Identify Compound D ---
    # Reaction: Diels-Alder between (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol (diene) and cis-but-2-ene (dienophile).
    # Product Name: (1S,4R,5S,6R)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol
    
    # Rule 1: Dienophile stereochemistry is retained.
    # cis-but-2-ene has two methyl groups cis to each other.
    # Expected: The methyl groups at C5 and C6 of the product must be cis.
    
    # Rule 2: Diene stereochemistry determines the relationship between C1 and C4 substituents.
    # (1E,3E)-diene gives trans substituents.
    # Expected: The -OH at C1 and the -CH3 at C4 must be trans.

    # To check the final answer, we need to know the relative stereochemistry
    # implied by the name (1S,4R,5S,6R).
    # For adjacent carbons in a cyclohexene ring:
    # (R,S) or (S,R) implies a cis relationship between the main substituents.
    # (R,R) or (S,S) implies a trans relationship.
    # This simple rule must be used with caution, but is often a good first check.
    
    # Let's check the relationships in the proposed answer C: (1S,4R,5S,6R)
    # Relationship between C5 and C6: (5S, 6R). This implies cis.
    # This matches Rule 1.
    rule1_satisfied = True

    # The relationship between C1 and C4 is not adjacent, so the simple R/S rule doesn't apply.
    # We must rely on the known stereochemical outcome. The combination (1S, 4R) for a
    # 1,4-disubstituted cyclohexene of this type corresponds to a trans relationship.
    # This matches Rule 2.
    rule2_satisfied = True
    
    # Rule 3: Endo selectivity. The LLM's reasoning states this places C4, C5, and C6 methyl groups
    # on the same face, trans to the C1-OH group. Let's check if the answer is consistent with this.
    # This implies:
    # - C4-Me and C5-Me are cis.
    # - C1-OH and C4-Me are trans (already checked).
    # - C1-OH and C5-Me are trans.
    # Let's check C4(R) and C5(S). Adjacent, (R,S) implies cis. This is consistent with the endo rule interpretation.
