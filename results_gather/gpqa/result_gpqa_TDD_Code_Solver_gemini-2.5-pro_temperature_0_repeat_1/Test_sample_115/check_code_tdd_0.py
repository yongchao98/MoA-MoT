    # --- Step 1: Identify Compound A ---
    # NMR data: 6H triplet at 0.9 ppm, 4H quartet at 1.3 ppm.
    # This signature (3:2 proton ratio, t/q splitting) indicates two equivalent ethyl groups.
    # The low chemical shifts (0.9, 1.3 ppm) are characteristic of an alkane, not an ether (where CH2-O would be ~3.5 ppm).
    # Therefore, Compound A is n-butane (CH3-CH2-CH2-CH3).
    compound_a = "n-butane"

    # --- Step 2: Identify Compound B ---
    # Monobromination of n-butane. Free-radical bromination is selective for the more stable secondary radical.
    # The major product is 2-bromobutane.
    compound_b = "2-bromobutane"

    # --- Step 3: Identify Compound C ---
    # Reaction of 2-bromobutane with alcoholic KOH is an E2 elimination.
    # Zaitsev's rule predicts the more substituted alkene, but-2-ene, as the major product.
    # The question states C has two geometrical isomers (cis/trans) and the cis-isomer is used.
