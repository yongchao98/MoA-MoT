    moles_oh_from_baoh2 = (conc_baoh2 * vol_baoh2) * 2

    # --- Step 2: Neutralization of strong acid and strong base ---

    # CH3COOH + OH- -> CH3COO- + H2O
    
    # The limiting reactant is the one with fewer moles.
    # In this case, moles_oh_after_strong_neut (0.10 mol) > moles_ch3cooh (0.05 mol),

    # in the presence of a much stronger base.
