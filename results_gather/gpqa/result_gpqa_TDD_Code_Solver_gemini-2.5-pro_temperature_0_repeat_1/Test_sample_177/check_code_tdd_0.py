    Checks the correctness of the answer to the physics question.

    The question asks for the mass dimension of kappa in the Lagrangian
    L_int = kappa * bar(psi) * sigma_munu * psi * F^munu
    and whether the theory is renormalizable.

    The provided answer is D, which corresponds to:
    - Mass dimension [kappa] = -1
    - The theory is not renormalizable.
