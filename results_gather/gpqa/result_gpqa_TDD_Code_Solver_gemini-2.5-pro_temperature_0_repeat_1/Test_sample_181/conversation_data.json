    "Here are the small, explicit tests for the Mott-Gurney equation's validity conditions:\n\n1.  **Test Carrier Type:** The model must be for a single-carrier device, not a two-carrier device.\n2.  **Test Trap Presence:** The model assumes an ideal, trap-free material.\n3.  **Test Dominant Current:** The model assumes current is dominated by carrier drift in the electric field, making diffusion current negligible. A statement claiming negligible *drift* current must be false.\n4.  **Test Injection Contact:** The model requires an Ohmic contact (or one with no injection barrier) that can supply an unlimited number of carriers. A Schottky contact, which has an injection barrier, is not suitable.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef get_mott_gurney_validity_conditions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a dictionary of the core assumptions for the Mott-Gurney law.\n    This function codifies the physical principles.\n    \"\"\"\n    return {\n        \"carrier_type\": \"single-carrier\",\n        \"traps\": \"trap-free\",\n        \"contact\": \"Ohmic\", # or \"no carrier injection barrier\"\n        \"dominant_current\": \"drift\" # implies diffusion is negligible\n    }\n\ndef check_statement(statement: str) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given statement accurately reflects the Mott-Gurney assumptions.\n    This is the main solution function.\n    \"\"\"\n    conditions = get_mott_gurney_validity_conditions()\n\n    # Condition 1: Must be single-carrier\n    if \"two-carrier\" in statement:\n        return False\n    if conditions[\"carrier_type\"] not in statement:\n        return False\n\n    # Condition 2: Must be trap-free\n    if conditions[\"traps\"] not in statement:\n        return False\n\n    # Condition 3: Must have Ohmic contact (no injection barrier)\n    if \"Schottky contact\" in statement:\n        return False\n    if not (\"Ohmic contact\" in statement or \"no carrier injection barrier\" in statement):\n        return False\n\n    # Condition 4: Must be drift-dominated (negligible diffusion)\n    if \"negligible drift\" in statement:\n        return False\n    if \"negligible diffusion\" not in statement:\n        return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef run_tests():\n    \"\"\"\n    Runs all tests and prints the final answer or failure message.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Test cases based on the problem's options\n    test_cases = {\n        \"A\": {\n            \"statement\": \"The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.\",\n            \"expected\": False,\n            \"reason\": \"Fails 'single-carrier' condition.\"\n        },\n        \"B\": {\n            \"statement\": \"The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.\",\n            \"expected\": True,\n            \"reason\": \"Satisfies all conditions.\"\n        },\n        \"C\": {\n            \"statement\": \"The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.\",\n            \"expected\": False,\n            \"reason\": \"Fails 'drift-dominated' condition (states negligible drift).\"\n        },\n        \"D\": {\n            \"statement\": \"The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.\",\n            \"expected\": False,\n            \"reason\": \"Fails 'Ohmic contact' condition.\"\n        }\n    }\n\n    correct_answer = None\n    for key, case in test_cases.items():\n        result = check_statement(case[\"statement\"])\n        if result != case[\"expected\"]:\n            print(f\"Test failed for option {key}!\")\n            print(f\"  Statement: '{case['statement']}'\")\n            print(f\"  Expected: {case['expected']}, but got: {result}\")\n            print(f\"  Reason: {case['reason']}\")\n            sys.exit(1) # Exit on first failure\n        if result is True:\n            correct_answer = key\n\n    if correct_answer:\n        print(f\"All tests passed.
