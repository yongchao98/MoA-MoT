    """
    Checks the correctness of an answer to the Mott-Gurney equation validity question.

    The question is:
    The Mott-Gurney equation describes the dark current (J) versus voltage (V) behavior of a semiconductor device in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. The equation can be expressed as
    $ J = \frac{9}{8} \epsilon \mu \frac{V^2}{L^3}$
    where $\epsilon$ is the dielectric constant, $\mu$ is the charge carrier mobility, and L is the length of the device. Which of the following statements is true about the validity of this equation?

    A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.
    B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.
    C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.
    D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.

        'D': "This is incorrect. The model assumes an Ohmic contact that provides an unlimited supply of carriers (i.e., no injection barrier). A Schottky contact is a rectifying contact that creates an energy barrier to injection, which violates this core assumption."
