    Checks the correctness of the provided answer by analyzing the qPCR data from the question.
    
    The function will verify the following claims based on the data:
    1.  The fundamental relationship between concentration and Ct value (for Option C).
    2.  The cycle difference per 10-fold dilution (for Option A).
    3.  The deviation within technical replicates (for Option B).
