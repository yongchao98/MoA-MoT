    """
    Checks the correctness of the LLM's answer regarding molecular symmetry.

    The function verifies two things:
    1.  If the chosen molecule (Option B) indeed has C3h symmetry in its idealized form.
    2.  If the point groups assigned to the other molecules in the explanation are correct.

    This check relies on a ground truth dictionary of point groups for the given molecules,
    which is standard practice in chemistry education for these types of problems.
