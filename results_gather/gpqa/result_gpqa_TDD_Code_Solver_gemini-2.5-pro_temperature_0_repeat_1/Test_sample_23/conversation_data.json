    "Here is a list of small, explicit tests the solution should satisfy, based on the problem description:\n\n1.  **Test for Z**: A hydrocarbon Z with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28% must be identifiable. The formula for cyclohexane (C6H12) should match this percentage closely.\n2.  **Test for Y**: Mixture Y must consist of two different saturated substances (in the context of not decolorizing bromine water) that both produce only Z upon hydrogenation. A mixture of cyclohexane (Z) and benzene fits this, as benzene doesn't react with bromine water and hydrogenates to cyclohexane.\n3.  **Test for X**: Mixture X must consist of two different unsaturated substances that both produce only Z upon hydrogenation. They must not have conjugated bonds. The total atoms in mixture X must balance the total atoms in mixture Y for the disproportionation reaction. A mixture of cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) fits this.\n4.  **Final Calculation Test**: The total number of hydrogen atoms from the two identified liquids in mixture X must be calculated correctly. For C6H10 and C6H8, the total should be 10 + 8 = 18.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_chemistry_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the chemistry puzzle using a series of assertions that act as tests\n    for each step of the logical deduction.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Helper function to calculate hydrogen mass fraction\n    def get_h_mass_fraction(c_atoms, h_atoms):\n        # Using standard atomic weights: C=12.011, H=1.008\n        total_mass = c_atoms * 12.011 + h_atoms * 1.008\n        h_mass = h_atoms * 1.008\n        return h_mass / total_mass\n\n    # --- Step 1: Identify Substance Z ---\n    # Test: Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (cycloalkane CnH2n) with H mass fraction ~14.28% (1/7)\n    # Let's test the most common cycloalkane solvent, cyclohexane.\n    Z = {'name': 'Cyclohexane', 'formula': {'C': 6, 'H': 12}}\n    z_h_fraction = get_h_mass_fraction(Z['formula']['C'], Z['formula']['H'])\n    # The problem states 14.28%, which is 0.1428.
