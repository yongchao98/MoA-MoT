    "Here are the tests and the Python implementation to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Tests\n\n1.  **Test Case A (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid):** The analysis should find one proton with 5 neighbors split into groups of (1H, 2H, 2H) resulting in a `dtt` signal, and another proton with 6 neighbors split into groups of (1H, 2H, 3H) resulting in a `dtq` signal.\n2.  **Test Case B (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid):** The analysis should find a proton with 6 neighbors (1H, 2H, 3H) giving a `dtq`, but no proton giving a `dtt`.\n3.  **Test Case C (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid):** The analysis should find a proton with 6 neighbors (1H, 2H, 3H) giving a `dtq`, but no proton giving a `dtt`.\n4.  **Test Case D (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid):** The analysis should find a proton with 5 neighbors (1H, 2H, 2H) giving a `dtt`, but no proton giving a `dtq`.\n5.  **Final Test:** The main function should correctly identify structure 'A' as the only one satisfying both NMR signal requirements.\n\n### 2.

    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n1.  **FTIR Analysis**:\n    *   A very broad absorption at ~3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption at ~1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   Conclusion: The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but doesn't distinguish between the isomers.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Analysis**:\n    *   **No vinyl hydrogens**: This means there are no C=C double bonds with hydrogens attached. All four options are saturated alkanoic acids, consistent with this observation.\n    *   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**: This complex splitting pattern arises from a proton being coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons. According to the n+1 rule, this proton must be adjacent to:\n        *   1 proton (giving the **d**oublet, 2-1=1)\n        *   2 protons (giving the **t**riplet, 3-1=2)\n        *   3 protons (giving the **q**uartet, 4-1=3)\n    *   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**: This proton must be adjacent to:\n        *   1 proton (giving the **d**oublet, 2-1=1)\n        *   2 protons (giving the first **t**riplet, 3-1=2)\n        *   2 protons (giving the second **t**riplet, 3-1=2)\n\n3.  **Evaluating the Candidates**:\n\n    *   **A) CH₃CH₂(C⁴H)(C₂H₅)(C³H)(C₂H₅)C²H₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n        *   Let's examine the proton at C3 (**H³**): It is coupled to **H⁴** (1H), the **C²H₂** group (2H), and the methylene protons of the ethyl group on C3 (**C³-CH₂**CH₃) (2H). This gives a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the required signals.\n        *   Let's examine the proton at C4 (**H⁴**): It is coupled to **H³** (1H), the terminal methyl group **C⁵H₃** (3H), and the methylene protons of the ethyl group on C4 (**C⁴-CH₂**CH₃) (2H). This gives a **doublet of quartets of triplets (dqt)**, which is the same as a **dtq**. This matches the other required signal.\n        *   **Conclusion**: Structure A exhibits both a `dtt` and a `dtq`.\n\n    *   **B) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n        *   The proton at C3 is coupled to H at C4 (1H), the CH₂ at C2 (2H), and the methyl at C3 (3H). This gives a `dtq`.\n        *   The proton at C4 is coupled to H at C3 (1H) and two methyl groups (6H). This gives a doublet of septets.\n        *   **Conclusion**: Has a `dtq` but no `dtt`.\n\n    *   **C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n        *   The proton at C3 is coupled to H at C2 (1H), the CH₂ at C4 (2H), and the methyl at C3 (3H). This gives a `dtq`.\n        *   The proton at C2 is coupled to H at C3 (1H) and the methyl at C2 (3H). This gives a doublet of quartets.\n        *   **Conclusion**: Has a `dtq` but no `dtt`.\n\n    *   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n        *   The proton at C3 is coupled to H at C2 (1H), the CH₂ at C4 (2H), and the ethyl's CH₂ at C3 (2H). This gives a `dtt`.\n        *   The proton at C2 is coupled to H at C3 (1H) and the ethyl's CH₂ at C2 (2H).
