def check_correctness():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the provided LLM answer.
    It recalculates the ratio of silicon atoms based on the problem's data
    and compares the result to the provided answer and derivation.

    The core of the problem relies on the definition of metallicity notation:
    [A/B] = log10( (nA/nB)_star ) - log10( (nA/nB)_sun )
    From this, a key identity can be derived:
    [A/B] = [A/H] - [B/H]

    # Using the identity [Si/Fe]_1 = [Si/H]_1 - [Fe/H]_1
    # Rearranging gives: [Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1
    Si_H_1 = Si_Fe_1 + Fe_H_1

    # log10(R) = [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2
