    # --- Step-by-step chemical analysis ---

    # Step 1: Benzene is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4 (Nitration).
    # This reaction adds a nitro group (-NO2) to the benzene ring.
    # The product is nitrobenzene. The -NO2 group is an electron-withdrawing group
    # and a meta-director for subsequent electrophilic aromatic substitution.
    product_1 = "nitrobenzene"

    # Step 2: Product 1 (nitrobenzene) is treated with Br2 and iron powder (Bromination).
    # Since the nitro group is a meta-director, the incoming bromine atom will be
    # directed to the meta-position (position 3).
    # The product is 3-bromonitrobenzene.
    product_2 = "3-bromonitrobenzene"

    # Step 3: Product 2 (3-bromonitrobenzene) is stirred with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (Reduction).
    # This is a standard catalytic hydrogenation that reduces the nitro group (-NO2)
    # to an amino group (-NH2).
    # The product is 3-bromoaniline.
    product_3 = "3-bromoaniline"

    # Step 4: Product 3 (3-bromoaniline) is treated with NaNO2 and HBF4 (Diazotization).
    # This converts the primary amine (-NH2) into a diazonium salt. The use of HBF4
    # specifically forms a diazonium tetrafluoroborate salt.
    # The product is 3-bromobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate.
    product_4 = "3-bromobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate"

    # Step 5: Product 4 is heated and then treated with anisole (Gomberg-Bachmann reaction).
    # Heating the diazonium salt generates a 3-bromophenyl radical. This radical
    # attacks the anisole (methoxybenzene) ring. The methoxy group (-OCH3) on anisole
    # is an electron-donating group and an ortho,para-director. Due to steric hindrance
    # from the bulky 3-bromophenyl radical, the attack preferentially occurs at the
    # less hindered para-position (position 4').
    # The final product is 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl.
    correct_final_product = "3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl"
