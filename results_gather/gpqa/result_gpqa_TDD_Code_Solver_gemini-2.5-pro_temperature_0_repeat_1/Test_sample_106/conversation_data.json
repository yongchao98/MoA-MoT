    "Here are the tests for the solution:\n\n1.  **Test Case 1 (Primary Scenario):** Given a complex molecule with multiple isomers/tautomers, the function should identify the most crucial step before extensive *in silico* docking. The expected answer is 'A', as integrating preliminary experimental (*in vitro*) data is the most robust way to validate and guide computational efforts.\n2.  **Test Case 2 (ADME/PK Focus):** If the question were about the next steps *after* establishing binding affinity, the function should identify that focusing on ADME/pharmacokinetics ('D') is appropriate for that later stage.\n3.  **Test Case 3 (Computational Simplification):** If the question were asking for a purely computational but risky simplification, the function should identify using only the most stable form ('B') as the answer.\n4.  **Test Case 4 (Computational Filtering):** If the question were about a reasonable, purely computational filtering method, the function should identify prioritizing based on physicochemical properties ('C') as the answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_drug_discovery_question(scenario):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a drug discovery scenario to determine the most crucial step.\n\n    The core logic is that for complex molecules (many isomers/tautomers),\n    the vast computational search space for docking is best narrowed down by\n    integrating real-world experimental data as early as possible.
