    "Here are the tests for the TDD approach.\n\n1.  **Test for Atropisomerism:** `dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate` has bulky groups at all four ortho positions, restricting rotation around the central C-C bond. This creates axial chirality, making it optically active. The test should expect `True`.\n2.  **Test for Chiral Center:** `methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate` has a carbon atom bonded to four different groups (-H, -OH, -CH3, -COOCH3). This is a chiral center, making the molecule optically active. The test should expect `True`.\n3.  **Test for Symmetry (Ketone):** `benzophenone` has a plane of symmetry that includes the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. It is achiral and thus not optically active. The test should expect `False`.\n4.  **Test for Symmetry (Alkene):** `dimethyl fumarate` is a *trans*-alkene. It is planar and possesses a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C bond. It is achiral. The test should expect `False`.\n5.  **Test for Simple Achiral Molecule:** `methane` is a simple, highly symmetric molecule and is achiral. The test should expect `False`.\n6.  **Test for Simple Chiral Molecule:** `2-butanol` has a chiral center and is a common example of an optically active molecule. The test should expect `True`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a list of compounds to determine which are optically active.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    def is_optically_active(compound_name: str) -> bool:\n        \"\"\"\n        Determines if a compound is optically active based on its structure.\n        A compound is optically active if it is chiral (non-superimposable on its mirror image).\n        This typically requires a chiral center or an element of axial/planar chirality,\n        and the absence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n        \"\"\"\n        # 1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate\n        # This is a substituted biphenyl.
