def check_nucleophile_reactivity_order():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the nucleophile reactivity order.
    The question asks to arrange the following from most to least reactive in an aqueous solution:
    1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate
    2. Hydroxide
    3. Propionate
    4. Methanol
    5. Ethanethiolate

    The options are:
    A) 5, 2, 1, 3 and 4
    B) 5, 2, 3, 1 and 4
    C) 2, 5, 3, 4 and 3
    D) 2, 5, 1, 4 and 3

    # --- Step 1: Establish the correct order based on chemical principles ---

    # Principle 1: Charge. Anions are significantly better nucleophiles than neutral molecules.
    # - Anions: 1 (alkoxide), 2 (hydroxide), 3 (carboxylate), 5 (thiolate)
    # - Neutral: 4 (Methanol)
    # Conclusion: Methanol (4) is the weakest nucleophile.

    # Principle 2: Nucleophilic Atom in a Protic Solvent (Aqueous).
    # In protic solvents, nucleophilicity increases down a group in the periodic table.
    # Sulfur is larger, more polarizable, and less solvated by water than oxygen.
    # Conclusion: Ethanethiolate (5) is the strongest nucleophile.

    # Principle 3: Resonance.
    # Resonance delocalizes the negative charge, stabilizing the anion and making it a weaker nucleophile.
    # - Propionate (3) has its charge delocalized over two oxygen atoms.
    # - Hydroxide (2) and 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1) have localized charges on a single oxygen.
    # Conclusion: Propionate (3) is weaker than both (1) and (2).

    # Principle 4: Steric Hindrance.
    # Comparing the two remaining oxygen anions, Hydroxide (2) and 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1).
    # - Hydroxide (2) is very small and not sterically hindered.
    # - 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1) is a bulky secondary alkoxide.
    # The lack of steric hindrance makes hydroxide a more effective nucleophile than the bulky alkoxide.
    # Conclusion: Hydroxide (2) is more reactive than 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1).

    # --- Step 2: Assemble the final correct order ---
    # Combining the principles:
    # Strongest: Ethanethiolate (5)
    # Next: Hydroxide (2)
    # Next: 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1)
    # Next: Propionate (3)
    # Weakest: Methanol (4)
    #
    # Final Correct Order: [5, 2, 1, 3, 4]
    
    correct_order = [5, 2, 1, 3, 4]
