    # --- Step 1: Calculate the chemically correct number of products ---

    # The reaction involves a racemic mixture of (R)- and (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene.
    # The product is 3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene.
    # Three reaction pairings are possible: (R)+(R), (S)+(S), and (R)+(S).

    # Homo-dimerization of (R) + (R) yields (E/Z)-(3R,6R) products.
    # These are 2 distinct diastereomers.
    RR_products = 2

    # Homo-dimerization of (S) + (S) yields (E/Z)-(3S,6S) products.
    # These are the 2 enantiomers of the (3R,6R) set.
    SS_products = 2

    # Cross-dimerization of (R) + (S) yields (3R,6S) products.
    # - The (E)-(3R,6S) isomer is chiral and forms an enantiomeric pair with (E)-(3S,6R).
    #   This gives 2 products.
    # - The (Z)-(3R,6S) isomer has a plane of symmetry and is a meso compound.
    #   Its mirror image is identical, so it is only 1 product.
    RS_products_correct = 2 + 1  # (E-enantiomeric pair) + (Z-meso compound)

    chemically_correct_total = RR_products + SS_products + RS_products_correct
    # Expected correct total: 2 + 2 + 3 = 7

    # --- Step 2: Calculate the number of products based on the flawed logic ---
    # The flawed logic described is to incorrectly count the Z-meso compound
    # and its identical mirror image as a distinct enantiomeric pair.

    # The (R)+(S) cross-dimerization is re-evaluated with this flaw.
    # - The (E)-(3R,6S) isomer is still a chiral pair (2 products).
    # - The (Z)-(3R,6S) meso compound is incorrectly counted as a pair (2 products).
    RS_products_flawed = 2 + 2  # (E-enantiomeric pair) + (Z-"enantiomeric" pair)

    flawed_logic_total = RR_products + SS_products + RS_products_flawed
    # Expected flawed total: 2 + 2 + 4 = 8

    # --- Step 3: Verify the LLM's answer and reasoning ---
    llm_chosen_answer_value = 8

    # Check 1: Does the chemically correct calculation yield 7?
    if chemically_correct_total != 7:
        return f"Incorrect. The reasoning is based on the premise that the chemically correct answer is 7, but this checker calculated it to be {chemically_correct_total}. The analysis of the reaction is flawed."

    # Check 2: Does the described flawed logic lead to the chosen answer of 8?
    if flawed_logic_total != llm_chosen_answer_value:
        return f"Incorrect. The reasoning claims that counting the meso compound twice leads to 8 products. However, this checker calculated that this specific error leads to {flawed_logic_total} products. The justification for choosing 8 is invalid."

    # If both checks pass, the LLM's logic is consistent. It correctly identified
    # that the true answer is 7 (not an option) and found a plausible error
    # that leads to option C (8).
