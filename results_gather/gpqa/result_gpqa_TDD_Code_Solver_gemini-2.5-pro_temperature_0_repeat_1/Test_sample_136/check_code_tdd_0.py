def check_synchrocyclotron_revolutions():
    """
    This function verifies the calculation for the number of revolutions a proton makes in a synchrocyclotron.

    The core physics principles are:
    1. The energy gained per acceleration event is ΔT = q * U, where U is the voltage at the time of crossing.
    2. For a sinusoidal voltage U(t) = U0 * cos(ωt + φ), if the particle crosses at a constant synchronous phase φ_s, the energy gain is ΔT = e * U0 * cos(φ_s).
    3. In a cyclotron/synchrocyclotron, the particle is accelerated twice per revolution (once entering a "Dee" and once leaving it).
    4. The total number of revolutions is the total number of accelerations divided by 2.
