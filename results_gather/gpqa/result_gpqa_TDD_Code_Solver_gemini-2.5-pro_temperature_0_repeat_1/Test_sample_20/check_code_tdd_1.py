    This function verifies the given answer to the chemistry question by applying chemical principles.

    1.  **Tautomerism Check (Part A):** It identifies which compound between benzoquinone and
        cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione lacks alpha-hydrogens and thus does not exhibit keto-enol tautomerism.
    2.  **Optical Isomerism Check (Part B):** It identifies which compound between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate
        and dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center and thus exhibits optical isomerism.
    3.  **Conclusion:** It compares the derived correct option with the provided answer.

    # --- Part A Analysis: Which compound does NOT show tautomerism? ---
    # Keto-enol tautomerism requires at least one alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group).
    # - p-Benzoquinone: The carbons adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of double bonds and have no hydrogens.
    #   Therefore, it does NOT show tautomerism.
    # - Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are CH2 groups. These are alpha-carbons with hydrogens.
    #   Therefore, it DOES show tautomerism.
    compound_A = "benzoquinone"

    # --- Part B Analysis: Which compound WILL show optical isomerism? ---
    # Optical isomerism requires a chiral center (typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).
    # - Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3): The central carbon (C2) is bonded to four different groups:
    #   1. -H, 2. -OH, 3. -CH3, 4. -COOCH3. It is chiral.
    #   Therefore, it WILL show optical isomerism.
    # - Dimethyl fumarate: This is a trans-alkene. It is a planar molecule with a plane of symmetry and no chiral centers.
    #   Therefore, it will NOT show optical isomerism.
