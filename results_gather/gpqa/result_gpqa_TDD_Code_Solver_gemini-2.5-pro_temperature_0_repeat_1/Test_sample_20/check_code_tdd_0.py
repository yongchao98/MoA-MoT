    This function checks the correctness of the given answer to a chemistry question
    about tautomerism and optical isomerism.

    The question asks:
    A: Which compound does NOT show tautomerism (benzoquinone vs. cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione)?
    B: Which compound WILL show optical isomerism (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate vs. dimethyl fumarate)?

    The provided answer is 'A', which corresponds to (A=benzoquinone, B=methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate).

    # --- Chemical Analysis ---

    # Part A: Tautomerism
    # Keto-enol tautomerism requires at least one alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen on a carbon
    # adjacent to a carbonyl group).
    # - Benzoquinone: The carbons adjacent to the C=O groups are part of C=C double bonds
    #   and have no attached hydrogens. Thus, it has no alpha-hydrogens.
    # - Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are CH2 groups,
    #   which are alpha to the carbonyls. It has alpha-hydrogens.
    # Conclusion for A: The compound that does NOT show tautomerism is benzoquinone.
    correct_compound_A = 'benzoquinone'

    # Part B: Optical Isomerism
    # Optical isomerism requires a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).
    # - Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3): The central carbon (C2) is bonded to
    #   four different groups: -H, -OH, -CH3, and -COOCH3. It is chiral.
    # - Dimethyl fumarate (CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3): This is a trans-alkene. It has a plane of
    #   symmetry and no chiral centers. It is achiral.
    # Conclusion for B: The compound that WILL show optical isomerism is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.
    correct_compound_B = 'methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate'

            f"1. For Part A (does not show tautomerism): The correct compound is '{correct_compound_A}'. Benzoquinone lacks alpha-hydrogens, which are required for keto-enol tautomerism. Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has alpha-hydrogens and thus shows tautomerism.\n"
            f"2. For Part B (shows optical isomerism): The correct compound is '{correct_compound_B}'. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral carbon and is optically active. Dimethyl fumarate is achiral.\n"
