    # --- Step 1: Analyze the nature of the energy spectrum ---
    # Principle: In particle decay, if the final state contains three or more
    # particles, the energy of any single product particle is distributed
    # continuously. A two-body final state results in discrete energies.

    # Original decay: 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V.

Both decays satisfy this, so the spectrum should remain continuous. The LLM's conclusion on this point is correct, but this check is for logical consistency."

    # --- Step 2: Analyze the endpoint of the spectrum (Q-value) ---
    # Principle: The endpoint energy (Q-value) is the mass difference between
    # initial and final states: Q = (m_initial - m_final) * c^2.
    # A higher Q-value means a higher endpoint.
    # To compare Q-values, we compare the total mass of the final states,
    # as the initial state (2A) is the same for both decays.

    # Let's represent the masses. We only need their relationships.
    # From the problem: M is massless, V is massive.

    # The total mass of the final state for the variant decay is:
    # m_final_variant = m(2B) + m(2E) + m(M)

    # The comparison hinges on m(2V) vs m(M).
    # Since m(V) > 0 and m(M) = 0, it follows that m(2V) > m(M).
    # Therefore, m_final_original > m_final_variant.
    final_mass_original_is_greater = mass_V_is_positive and mass_M_is_zero

    if not final_mass_original_is_greater:
        return "Incorrect: The mass comparison is flawed. Based on the problem statement (M is massless, V is massive), the total mass of the original decay's products must be greater than the variant's."

    # Since Q is inversely related to m_final (Q = m_initial - m_final),
    # a smaller m_final results in a larger Q.
    # Because m_final_original > m_final_variant, it must be that Q_variant > Q_original.
