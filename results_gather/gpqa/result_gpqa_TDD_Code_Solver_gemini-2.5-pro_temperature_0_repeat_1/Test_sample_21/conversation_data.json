    "Here are the tests for the problem:\n1.  **Test Thermodynamics**: The standard reduction potential of oxygen in a basic solution (O₂ + 2H₂O + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻, E° = +0.40 V) is lower than in an acidic solution (O₂ + 4H⁺ + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O, E° = +1.23 V). A lower potential means it is a weaker oxidant. The test should confirm the property is \"weaker\".\n2.  **Test Kinetics**: The reduction of molecular oxygen is a multi-electron process that requires breaking a strong O=O double bond. This results in a high activation energy, making the reaction kinetically slow, even when thermodynamically favorable. The test should confirm the property is \"slower\".\n3.  **Test Final Combination**: Based on the first two tests, the correct combination is \"weaker\" and \"slower\". This corresponds to option C. The test should verify that the function returns \"C\".\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_electrochemistry_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the correct words to complete the statement about oxygen's electrochemical properties.\n    \n    Statement: Thermodynamically, oxygen is a ...... oxidant in basic solutions. \n               Kinetically, oxygen reacts ...... in acidic solutions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Part 1: Thermodynamics - Oxidant Strength\n    # The strength of an oxidant is measured by its standard reduction potential (E°).\n    # A higher E° means a stronger oxidant.\n    # E° for O₂ reduction in acidic solution: O₂(g) + 4H⁺(aq) + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O(l) is +1.23 V.\n    # E° for O₂ reduction in basic solution: O₂(g) + 2H₂O(l) + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻(aq) is +0.40 V.\n    # Since +0.40 V < +1.23 V, oxygen is a WEAKER oxidant in basic solutions compared to acidic solutions.\n    thermodynamic_property = \"weaker\"\n\n    # Part 2: Kinetics - Reaction Rate\n    # The reduction of O₂ is a complex, multi-electron (4e⁻) transfer process that involves\n    # breaking the strong O=O double bond.
