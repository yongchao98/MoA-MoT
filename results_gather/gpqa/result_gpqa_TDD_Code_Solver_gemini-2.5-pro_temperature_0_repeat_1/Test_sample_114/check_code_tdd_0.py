    # The total energy of a particle is E = gamma * m * c^2. In our units (m=1, c=1), E = gamma.
    # The electron moves from the left (+x direction), the positron from the right (-x direction).

    # The problem states one photon goes upper-right and the other lower-right.
    # This implies their y-momenta cancel out, and their x-momenta add up.
    # Let theta be the angle of each photon with respect to the x-axis.

    # p_final_x = p_photon_1x + p_photon_2x = 2 * momentum_photon_magnitude * cos(theta)
