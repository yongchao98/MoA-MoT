    # --- Physical Constants in Natural Units ---
    # Rest mass of electron/positron (m_e) = 1
    # Speed of light (c) = 1

    # --- Step 1: Conservation of Energy ---
    # The relativistic energy of a particle is E = gamma * m * c^2.
    # In our natural units, E = gamma.

    # --- Step 2: Conservation of Momentum ---
    # The relativistic momentum of a particle is p = sqrt(gamma^2 - 1) * m * c.

    # The electron moves from the left (+x direction).

    # For a photon, momentum p = E / c. In our natural units, p = E.
    momentum_per_photon = energy_per_photon

    # --- Step 3: Calculate the Angle ---
    # After the collision, the total momentum must be conserved.
    # Since the initial y-momentum is 0 and the photons have equal energy (and thus equal momentum magnitude),
    # they must be emitted at symmetric angles (theta and -theta) to the x-axis.
    # The total final momentum in the x-direction is the sum of the x-components of the two photons' momenta.
    # P_final_x = p_photon * cos(theta) + p_photon * cos(-theta)
    # P_final_x = 2 * p_photon * cos(theta)
    
    # By conservation of momentum: P_initial_x = P_final_x
    # total_initial_momentum_x = 2 * momentum_per_photon * cos(theta)
    
    # We can now solve for cos(theta).
    cos_theta = total_initial_momentum_x / (2.0 * momentum_per_photon)

    total_angle_rad = 2.0 * theta_rad
    
    # Convert the final angle to degrees.
    calculated_angle_degrees = math.degrees(total_angle_rad)
