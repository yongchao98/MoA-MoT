    "Here are the steps following the Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology to determine the number of stereoisomers for 6-chloro-9-ethyl-2-methylundeca-3,7-dien-5-ol.\n\n### Step 1: List of Tests\n\nThe solution will be a function that calculates the number of stereoisomers based on the number of stereocenters. The number of stereoisomers for an unsymmetrical molecule is given by the formula 2^n, where 'n' is the total number of stereocenters (chiral centers + stereogenic double bonds).\n\n1.  **Test Case 1 (No stereocenters):** `propane`\n    - Chiral centers: 0\n    - Stereogenic double bonds: 0\n    - Total stereocenters (n): 0\n    - Expected stereoisomers: 2^0 = 1\n\n2.  **Test Case 2 (One chiral center):** `butan-2-ol`\n    - Chiral centers: 1\n    - Stereogenic double bonds: 0\n    - Total stereocenters (n): 1\n    - Expected stereoisomers: 2^1 = 2\n\n3.  **Test Case 3 (One stereogenic double bond):** `but-2-ene`\n    - Chiral centers: 0\n    - Stereogenic double bonds: 1\n    - Total stereocenters (n): 1\n    - Expected stereoisomers: 2^1 = 2\n\n4.  **Test Case 4 (Chiral center and double bond):** `4-chloropent-2-ene`\n    - Chiral centers: 1 (at C4)\n    - Stereogenic double bonds: 1 (at C2=C3)\n    - Total stereocenters (n): 2\n    - Expected stereoisomers: 2^2 = 4\n\n5.  **Test Case 5 (The target compound):** `6-chloro-9-ethyl-2-methylundeca-3,7-dien-5-ol`\n    - Analysis of the structure: `(CH3)2CH-CH=CH-CH(OH)-CH(Cl)-CH=CH-CH(Et)2`\n    - Chiral centers: 2 (at C5 and C6). C2 and C9 are not chiral as they are attached to two identical groups each.\n    - Stereogenic double bonds: 2 (the C3=C4 and C7=C8 double bonds).\n    - Total stereocenters (n): 2 + 2 = 4\n    - Expected stereoisomers: 2^4 = 16\n\n### Step 2: Python Implementation\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_stereoisomers(num_chiral_centers, num_stereogenic_double_bonds):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of stereoisomers for a molecule.\n\n    This function assumes the molecule is unsymmetrical, so the formula 2^n applies,\n    where n is the total number of stereocenters.

    "Excellent! The TDD process has confirmed the logic, and the analysis of the molecule is correct.\n\n1.  **Identify Stereocenters:**\n    *   **Chiral Carbons:** An atom with four different groups attached.\n        *   **C5:** Bonded to H, -OH, the C3=C4 side, and the C6-Cl side.

This is a chiral center.\n        *   C2 is bonded to two methyl groups (C1 and the substituent), so it is not chiral.\n        *   C9 is bonded to two ethyl groups (the C10-C11 part of the chain and the substituent), so it is not chiral.\n        *   *Total Chiral Centers = 2*\n    *   **Stereogenic Double Bonds:** A double bond where each carbon has two different groups attached, allowing for E/Z isomerism.\n        *   **C3=C4:** C3 is attached to H and an isopropyl group.
