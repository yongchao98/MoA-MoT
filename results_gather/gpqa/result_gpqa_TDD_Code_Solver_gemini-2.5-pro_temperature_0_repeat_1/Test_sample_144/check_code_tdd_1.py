def check_stereoisomer_count():
    """
    This function programmatically verifies the number of stereoisomers for
    6-chloro-9-ethyl-2-methylundeca-3,7-dien-5-ol.

    It does this by:
    1. Defining the groups attached to each potential stereocenter.
    2. Counting the number of chiral carbons (4 different groups).
    3. Counting the number of stereogenic double bonds (E/Z isomerism).
    4. Calculating the total number of stereoisomers using the 2^n formula.
    5. Comparing the result with the provided answer.
