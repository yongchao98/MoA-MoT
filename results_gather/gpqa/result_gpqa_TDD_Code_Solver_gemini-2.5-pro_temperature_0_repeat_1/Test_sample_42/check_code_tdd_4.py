def check_iupac_name():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the IUPAC name for the described molecule.

    The function follows these steps:
    1.  Deduces the molecule's structure from the given positional constraints.
    2.  Applies IUPAC numbering rules, including the alphabetical tie-breaker.
    3.  Assembles the final name by listing substituents alphabetically.
    4.  Compares the generated name to the provided answer (Option D).

    # Step 1: Deduce the structure from constraints.
    # The parent is benzoic acid, so C1 has the -COOH group.
    # - Methoxy is para to C1 -> Methoxy is at C4.
    # - Hydroxyl and Dimethylamino are ortho to C1 -> They are at C2 and C6.
    # - Cyano and Formyl are meta to C1 -> They are at C3 and C5.
    # - Crucial constraint: Methoxy (at C4) and Hydroxyl are ortho to Cyano.
    #   - For Methoxy (C4) to be ortho to Cyano, Cyano must be at C3 or C5.
    #   - For Hydroxyl (at C2 or C6) to be ortho to Cyano:
    #     - If Cyano is at C3, its ortho positions are C2 and C4. Hydroxyl must be at C2. This works.
    #     - If Cyano is at C5, its ortho positions are C4 and C6. Hydroxyl must be at C6. This also works.
    # Both possibilities lead to the same final name, so we can proceed with the first one.
    
    # Deduced structure based on the first possibility:
    # C1: COOH (implied parent)
    # C2: hydroxyl
    # C3: cyano
    # C4: methoxy
    # C5: formyl (the remaining meta position)
    # C6: dimethylamino (the remaining ortho position)

    # Step 2: Determine the correct numbering based on the alphabetical tie-breaker.
    # The set of locants is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6} regardless of numbering direction.
    # We must give the lowest number to the substituent that comes first alphabetically.
    # Alphabetical order of substituents: cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.
    # The first is "cyano".
    # The numbering scheme we deduced above gives "cyano" the locant 3.
    # The alternative numbering (counter-clockwise) would give "cyano" the locant 5.
    # Since 3 < 5, our deduced numbering is correct.
