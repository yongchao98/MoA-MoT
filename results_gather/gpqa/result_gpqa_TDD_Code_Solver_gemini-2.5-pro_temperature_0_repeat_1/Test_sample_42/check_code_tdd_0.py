    This function programmatically determines the correct IUPAC name for the molecule described
    in the question and compares it to the provided answer (Option D).

    The process involves:
    1.  Defining all constraints from the question.
    2.  Generating all possible molecular structures that fit the initial constraints.
    3.  Filtering these structures based on the key constraint involving the nitrile group.
    4.  Applying IUPAC's "lowest locant for first alphabetical substituent" tie-breaker rule
        to select the single correct structure.
    5.  Constructing the full IUPAC name from the selected structure.
    6.  Comparing the constructed name against the provided answer.
