    question_type = "IUPAC nomenclature for a substituted benzene ring"
    
    # The provided answer is for a geometry problem, not the chemistry question.
    # Therefore, the answer is fundamentally incorrect.
    initial_check_reason = (
        f"The provided answer '{llm_answer}' is incorrect because it solves a mathematics problem "

        "The correct answer must be an IUPAC name from the given options (A, B, C, D)."

    # --- Part 2: Solve the chemistry question to find the correct answer ---

    # Step 2.1: Decode the structure from the question's constraints.
    # The parent structure is a benzoic acid, so -COOH is at position 1.
    # Constraints:
    # 1. -COOH (1), -CHO (formyl), and -CN (cyano) are meta to one another. This places -CHO and -CN at positions 3 and 5.
    # 2. -OH (hydroxyl) and -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino) are ortho to -COOH (1). This places them at positions 2 and 6.
    # 3. -OCH3 (methoxy) is para to -COOH (1). This places it at position 4.
    # 4. Final constraint to resolve ambiguity: -OCH3 (at 4) and -OH are ortho to -CN.
    #    For -OCH3 at 4 to be ortho to -CN, -CN must be at position 3 or 5. Let's test position 5.
    #    If -CN is at 5, its ortho positions are 4 and 6.
    #    - The methoxy group is at 4, which satisfies the constraint.
    #    - The hydroxyl group (-OH) must therefore be at position 6 to satisfy the constraint.
    #
    # This resolves all positions unambiguously:
    # Pos 1: -COOH (principal group)
    # Pos 2: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)
    # Pos 3: -CHO (formyl)
    # Pos 4: -OCH3 (methoxy)
    # Pos 5: -CN (cyano)
    # Pos 6: -OH (hydroxy)

    # Step 2.2: Apply IUPAC numbering rules.
    # The locant set is fixed: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. When locant sets are identical, we number
    # to give the lowest locant to the substituent cited first in the name (i.e., alphabetical priority).
    # Alphabetical order of substituents: cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.
    
    # We must choose the numbering direction (clockwise vs. counter-clockwise) that assigns
    # the lowest number to the first group in the alphabetical list.
    #
    # Direction A (clockwise from COOH):
    # 2-dimethylamino, 3-formyl, 4-methoxy, 5-cyano, 6-hydroxy
    #
    # Direction B (counter-clockwise from COOH):
    # 2-hydroxy, 3-cyano, 4-methoxy, 5-formyl, 6-dimethylamino
    #
    # The first substituent alphabetically is "cyano".
    # In Direction A, cyano is at position 5.
    # In Direction B, cyano is at position 3.
    # Since 3 < 5, Direction B is the correct numbering scheme.

    # Step 2.3: Construct the correct name based on Direction B numbering.
    # The locants are: 3-cyano, 6-dimethylamino, 5-formyl, 2-hydroxy, 4-methoxy.
    # Listing these alphabetically gives the final name:
    correct_name = "3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid"

    # Step 2.4: Compare with the given options.
